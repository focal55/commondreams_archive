<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">KYOTO (JAPAN) / BRUSSELS (BELGIUM) -- February 14 -- Friends of the Earth International warned today that the United Nations Kyoto agreement on climate change that will enter into force on February 16 is only a first modest step towards more drastic greenhouse gas emission cuts needed to address climate change. [1]</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The day when the Kyoto treaty goes live is a day to celebrate, but Friends of the Earth also expressed deep disappointment that on February 9 the European Union backed away from its leadership role by refusing to earmark targets for future gas emission cuts after the first commitment period of Kyoto ends in 2012. [2]</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Governments and environmental groups around the globe are set to mark the entry into force of the Kyoto Protocol with speeches, exhibitions, parties and parades [3].</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Past emissions of greenhouse gases, largely from industrialised countries, mean that the world cannot avoid an increase of average global temperature to 1.3&ordm;C above pre-industrial levels. If the average temperature rises beyond 2&ordm;C, the impacts of climate change, which we are already suffering will become catastrophic. [4]</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The evidence that climate change is proceeding apace is piling up and weather extremes across the planet are increasing, both in frequency and intensity. A recent high-level international taskforce &#147;Meeting the Climate Challenge&#148; has revealed that global emissions have to peak by as early as 2015 in order to avoid uncontrollable climate change.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Catherine Pearce of Friends of the Earth International said &#147;Whilst Kyoto is an important first step, we really need to see some teeth to future international efforts. The world around us is already changing, in dramatic and life threatening ways, It is time for rich countries to act now, before it becomes too late. The US, as the world&#146;s biggest polluter must of course play its part.&quot;</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;In particular the European Union must continue to take the lead on future action and should not wait and see what others will do. With concerted action, industrialised countries, led by the European Union, can be delivering cuts in emissions and set us on the path to 80% reductions by 2050 -- to the benefit of our economies and the well-being of our citizens,&#148; she added.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Official negotiations in November this year will begin to discuss commitments post 2012 when the first Kyoto commitment period is due to end. One key question will be how to tackle fast growing emissions from emerging economies such as China, India and Brazil and introduce policies that decouple economic growth from emissions.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Friends of the Earth believes that Western countries which have enjoyed economic growth through the burning of fossil fuels (and have therefore contributed most to climate change), must help finance low carbon development in the south, and phase out public financing of fossil fuels and into cleaner energies.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">FOR MORE INFORMATION CONTACT FRIENDS OF THE EARTH</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">EUROPE:<br>- Catherine Pearce, Friends of the Earth International (in London) +44 (0)7811 283 641 or direct line: +44 (0)20 7566 1723 or email <a href="mailto:catp@foe.co.uk" target="_new">catp@foe.co.uk</a><br>- Jan Kowalzig, Climate Campaigner, Friends of the Earth Europe (in Brussels) +32-2-5426102 or email <a href="mailto:jan.kowalzig@foeeurope.org" target="_new">jan.kowalzig@foeeurope.org</a><br>- Markus Steigenberger, Friends of the Earth Germany (in Berlin) Tel: +49 30 27586 468 or email <a href="mailto:markus.steigenberger@bund.net" target="_new">markus.steigenberger@bund.net</a></font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">JAPAN:<br>Yuri Onodera, Climate Campaigner, Friends of the Earth Japan +81- 3951-1081 or email <a href="mailto:yurio@iea.att.ne.jp" target="_new">yurio@iea.att.ne.jp</a></font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">AMERICAS:<br>Roque Pedace in Argentina: + 54-1146290386 or email <a href="mailto:rqpedacear@yahoo.com.ar" target="_new">rqpedacear@yahoo.com.ar</a></font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>NOTES TO EDITORS:</i></font></p><p align="LEFT"><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">[1] 141 countries have to date ratified the Kyoto Protocol.
