<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- March 2 -- New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson today called on the Bush Administration and the Congress to put a moratorium on oil and gas leasing in ecologically sensitive onshore areas such as New Mexico's Otero Mesa and Valle Vidal.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;I support the offshore oil and gas leasing moratoriums that the Bush Administration has continued off coastal states including California and Florida,&quot; Governor Bill Richardson said during a speech to the National Environmental Trust. &quot;Now I want to ask the coastal states, the Bush Administration, and Congress to support leasing moratoriums for some ecologically sensitive onshore areas, as well.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Governor Richardson is scheduled to return to Santa Fe tonight following the speech.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Richardson said his proposal would balance proposed oil and gas development on Western public lands.  &quot;We are not against oil and gas development, but there are areas that should not be developed,&quot; Governor Richardson said.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;This is an opportunity for governors to establish higher standards of environmental protection across the board,&quot; said Carl Pope, Sierra Club Executive Director. &quot;When the federal government fails to protect special places from oil and gas drilling, Governors should be allowed to step up to the plate and fill that gap. Just like our precious coasts, these inland natural treasures also deserve protection.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Governor Richardson said his proposal would protect about 750,000 acres in New Mexico, about 1% of the state's area.  The Governor has proposed a ban on leasing of more than 600,000 acres at Otero Mesa, an internationally recognized desert grassland area that overlies pristine, untapped groundwater.  He has also asked the Bush Administration not to conduct oil and gas leasing of 100,000 acres of prime hunting and fishing area in the Valle Vidal.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;I recognize the importance of energy development, and a far larger area remains open to oil and gas leasing,&quot; Governor Richardson said.  &quot;I am asking the Administration and Congress to give onshore areas the same kind of ecological attention they have been willing to give places such as Florida and California.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Under offshore oil and gas restrictions, more than 600 million acres remain under moratorium.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The Interior Department has ignored its own rules requiring it to balance state and national interests,&quot; said Richardson.  &quot;In recently released plans affecting lands throughout the West, the Department has proposed opening 97% of public lands to oil and gas development, which is not a balanced or sustainable approach.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Governor Richardson said his approach has support from coastal moratorium advocates such as Congressman Sam Farr, whose district includes Monterey, California.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Governor Richardson made his announcement at the 10th Anniversary celebration of the National Environmental Trust, where he received NET's Environmental Leadership Award, with more than 500 people in attendance.</font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
