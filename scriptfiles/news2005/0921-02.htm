<td colspan="2"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->SANTA MONICA, California - September 21 - After  refusing for two years to admit a conflict of interest,  Sen. Bill Frist (R-Tenn.) has now sold his $10 million to $30 million  holdings in the Frist family-founded HCA hospital chain.
<p>   The Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights (FTCR) filed  an ethics complaint with the United States Senate Ethics  Committee last April charging Frist with an irreconcilable  conflict of interest for promoting medical malpractice liability  limits that would financially benefit HCA, which also owns the  nation's fourth largest malpractice insurer.</p>
<p>   "Sen. Frist sold off his stock to protect his political  image, and the rest of the Senate should recognize the  implications and do the same," said Carmen Balber, consumer  advocate with FTCR. "The motive of every Senator with holdings in  a hospital, insurer or pharmaceutical company should conflict  them out of a decision affecting those companies' financial  interests."</p>
<p>   In July, Congressman James Sensenbrenner (R-Wis.) recused  himself from voting on legislation that would have limited  pharmaceutical companies' liability for selling dangerous drugs  because he holds millions in pharmaceutical industry stock.  The  Senate must now live up to the Sensenbrenner Standard, said FTCR.</p>

<p>   FTCR noted, however, that the Senate Majority Leader should  still recuse himself from the medical liability debate because  his immediate family maintains significant financial interest in  HCA.  Frist's brother, Thomas, is HCA's largest non-institutional  shareholder, with over $200 million in HCA stock, and sits on the  company's board.</p>
<p>   Frist has been an advocate for legislation to impose a  malpractice damage cap and other changes in the medical liability  system that would financially benefit HCA, and the company's  medical malpractice insurer, Health Care Indemnity (HCI), by  limiting their responsibility to compensate patients who are  victims of medical negligence.</p>

<p>   FTCR has urged Congress to pass strong insurance reform, not  limits on victims' rights, to stabilize doctors' increasing  malpractice premiums. The group released a report which shows  that  medical malpractice premiums rose 450 percent after the  passage of a malpractice cap in California, and did not fall or  stabilize until the voters approved insurance reform initiative  Proposition 103, which included strict rate regulation and a  mandatory rate rollback. The report is available at: </p>
