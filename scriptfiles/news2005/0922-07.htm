<p>JAKARTA / LONDON - September 22 - The Orang-utan 
is facing extinction due to the destruction of rainforest in Indonesia 
and Malaysia to set up oil-palm plantations, new research reveals.

<p>The ‘Oil for Ape Scandal’, published today Septemeber 23 by Friends of 
the Earth and the world’s leading orang-utan conservation groups, 
concludes that without urgent intervention the palm oil trade could 
cause the extinction of Asia’s only great ape within 12 years [1].

<p>Palm oil is found in many products on supermarket shelves, from bread to 
margarine, lipstick and soap.  Despite being warned for years by 
environmental groups that oil-palm plantations are associated with 
rainforest destruction and human rights abuses, the report finds that 
most UK companies don’t even know where their palm oil comes from.

<p>The report finds that almost 90 percent of orang-utan habitat in 
Indonesia and Malaysia has now been destroyed. Some experts estimate 
that 5,000 orang-utan perish as a result every year. The researchers 
found that oil-palm plantations have now become the primary cause of the 
orang-utans’ decline, wiping out its rainforest home in Borneo and Sumatra.

<p>New evidence shows that orang-utan rescue centres in Indonesia are 
over-flowing with orphaned baby orang-utans rescued from forests being 
cleared to make way for oil-palm plantations.  The Indonesian Government 
is now planning to convert a large part of Tanjung Puting National Park, 
the world’s most famous protected area for orang-utan, into an oil-palm 
plantation.

<p>Research in the UK by Friends of the Earth found that at least 84 per 
cent of UK companies are failing to take effective action to ensure they 
do not buy palm oil from destructive sources and not one single UK 
supermarket knows where the palm oil originates in the products it 
sells.  The story of corporate failure on palm oil is repeated across 
Europe. The European Union is the world’s biggest buyer of palm oil.

<p>Two weeks ago the United Nations published the Kinshasa Declaration, an 
action plan backed by the UK Government to save the world’s great apes 
from extinction [2]. The Indonesian Government signed on to this 
agreement but so far the Malaysian Government has failed to do so. Friends of the Earth and the orang-utan conservation groups are urging 
both governments to adopt and implement the declaration and end the 
conversion of orang-utan habitat into oil-palm plantations.

<p>They also say that the failure of European companies to take action 
shows that they cannot be trusted to act responsibly. They are calling 
on European Governments and the European Commission to legislate to stop 
European companies acting in such a damaging way.

<p>Ian Redmond, Chairman of the Ape Alliance, said:
“Governments that provide a market for palm oil must legislate to make 
their corporations responsible and accountable for their impacts.  If 
not, it is we who will have to explain to our children that the 
orang-utan became extinct, not because of a lack of knowledge, but 
because of corporate greed and a lack of political will.”

<p>Rully Syumanda of WALHI/friends of the earth Indonesia said:

<p>"We cannot win the battle to save the Indonesian rainforest while 
companies in consuming countries continue to buy palm oil from sources 
linked to human rights abuse and species extinction. The Governments of 
these countries must legislate and force these companies to stop acting 
so destructively."

<p>Research by Friends of the Earth shows that the forest fires which 
ravaged the island of Sumatra in August, and continue to burn today, 
were mostly set by palm oil companies clearing land to set up their 
plantations.  It is estimated that one third of the orang-utan 
population on Borneo was killed by the forest fires of 1998.

<p>Dr Willie Smits, Founder of the Borneo Orangutan Survival Foundation, 
aid: “The rate of loss of orang-utan has never been greater than in the 
last three years, and oil-    palm plantations are mostly to blame.”

<p>Professor Biruté Galdikas, founder of the Orangutan Foundation 
International, said:
“The orang-utan is endangered because of habitat loss. Today the 
greatest threat to orang-utan habitat is the continued expansion of 
oil-palm plantations. Palm oil is the greatest enemy of orang-utan and 
their continued survival in the wild."

<p>Dr Ian Singleton, Scientific Director for the Sumatran Orangutan 
Conservation Programme, said:
“We have already lost huge areas of orang-utan habitat and tens of 
thousands of orang-utan     to the palm oil industry.  Now there are 
reports of an “oil-palm fence” which will stretch 845     kilometres 
along the border with Malaysia in Borneo, crossing through orang-utan 
habitat. The problem is truly immense.”
