<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- March 9 -- On Thursday, March 10th, grassroots activists from across the country will be calling their congressional members to oppose the $80 billion appropriation request for Iraq.  Progressive Democrats of America (PDA) has called for this National Call-In Day at the urging of its members, who represent some of the 44 million Americans opposed to the Iraq war and continued occupation.  This National Call-In Day is part of a larger PDA campaign calling for an end to the occupation of Iraq and the reallocation of the military budget to urgent domestic concerns.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On Thursday, PDA members will be requesting opposition to the appropriation request as well as demanding that the Congressional Republican leadership permit public hearings, debate and amendments linking the funds to a strict timetable for military withdrawal and support for Iraqi sovereignty.  One such amendment has been proposed by Rep. Lynn Woolsey (D-CA): House Resolution (H.Con.Res.35) to End the US Occupation of Iraq.  In addition to the planned calls, PDA members have been sending e-mails to their Representatives regarding Iraq this week.  PDA hopes to surpass their earlier e-mail campaign successes, including the 100,000 e-mails their members generated in support of the Ohio Election Investigations.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;To acquiesce to the President&#146;s demand for even more money for Iraq without requiring a timeline for troop withdrawal is both foolhardy and dangerous,&#148; says Tim Carpenter, Executive Director of PDA, &#147;We need to support our troops by bringing them back safely, and to support America by using these funds to save desperately under-funded programs at home.&#148;</font></p><p> </p><p><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">About Progressive Democrats of America<br></font></i><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Progressive Democrats of America is one of the fastest growing political organizations in the country.
