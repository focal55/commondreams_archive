<p>WASHINGTON - The Bush Administration released a report illustrating what conservationists have long recognized: the conservation of wildlands is good for the economy.  The report, Banking on Nature 2004, details that almost $1.4 billion in total economic activity was generated by the recreational use of America's National Wildlife Refuges in 2004.  The report is available at http://www.fws.gov/refuges/. 

<p>"This report shows that it is in America's economic interest to keep our nation's public lands wild and not to open special places like the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge up to oil drilling which would harm the fish, wildlife and recreational opportunities found there, " said Bart Semcer, Sierra Club's Fish and Wildlife Policy Specialist.

<p>The report found that nearly 37 million people visited national wildlife refuges in 2004. creating almost 24,000 private sector jobs and producing about $454 million in employment income. Additionally, recreational spending on refuges generated nearly $151 million in tax revenue at the local, county, state and federal level.

<p>"As an ecotourism business, our bottom line has as much to do with dollars as with our continued ability to operate in a way that's sustainable for the Arctic Refuge itself,” said Jennifer van den Berg, an owner, guide and outfitter with Arctic Wild who runs commercial expeditions in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.

<p>"When doing business in a place like the Arctic Refuge, anything less than 'leave it as good as you found it' is bad for the next visitor, bad for the land and wildlife, and ultimately, bad for business.  The last thing ecotourism-- or a wildlife refuge-- needs are drill rigs, roads, and pipelines,” said van den Berg. 

<p>Fish- and wildlife-based recreation -- including hunting, fishing and wildlife-watching -- contributed more than $100 billion to the U.S. economy in 2001, the last year for which numbers are available.

<p>"I used my credit card from Alexandria, Virginia, all the way to Anchorage, Alaska, buying equipment I needed to fish the Arctic Refuge," said Semcer, who traveled to the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in August for a week of fishing. "Fish and wildlife based recreation are huge contributors to the American economy, and the national wildlife refuges are the places where much of this recreation occurs.  If that is going to continue the government needs to invest in improving the habitat and water quality on the refuges, not building haul roads and oil rigs."
