<p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- April 13 -- Congressman Norm Dicks (D-Wash.), journalist Tom Brokaw, and Alcoa will be honored for their support of the national parks at the National Parks Conservation Association&#146;s annual Salute to the Parks awards dinner. The event, Salute to the Parks: Celebrating the National Park Ranger, will be at the Ritz Carlton in Washington, D.C., on Wednesday, April 13, 2005, at 7 p.m. Each year, NPCA&#146;s annual dinner draws hundreds of dignitaries, including members of Congress, the National Park Service, and distinguished conservationists. This year, NPCA expects more than 600 guests.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The event theme, Celebrating the National Park Ranger, is a tribute to National Park Service employees for their dedication, knowledge, and stewardship of the natural, cultural, and historical treasures held in the public trust.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Rep. Norm Dicks will be recognized with NPCA&#146;s William Penn Mott Jr. Park Leadership Award, bestowed on a public figure that has made a singular achievement on behalf of park protection. Rep. Dicks is being honored for his efforts as ranking member of the Interior Appropriations Subcommittee to increase funding for national parks.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Tom Brokaw will receive NPCA&#146;s Robin W. Winks Award for Enhancing Public Understanding of National Parks, which honors individuals who have effectively communicated the values of the National Park System. NPCA honors Mr. Brokaw&#146;s efforts to bring attention to the threats imperiling the national parks and for his role in the creation of the World War II Memorial&#151;America&#146;s 388th national park unit.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Alcoa will receive the first Corporate Park Achievement Award for its work to permanently set aside 10,000 acres for preservation as ecologically significant land adjacent to Great Smoky Mountains National Park. Alcoa worked with a number of organizations, including The Nature Conservancy and NPCA, to craft a landmark agreement that effectively prevents commercial development near this portion of Great Smoky Mountains, the most visited national park in the National Park System, and helps to ensure the park&#146;s protection for the future.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Booz Allen Hamilton is the underwriter of this year&#146;s event. Booz Allen Hamilton Senior Vice President Joyce Doria is serving as co-chair along with Phyllis Burns (wife of Sen. Conrad Burns, R-Mont.), Rachel Nugent (wife of Rep. Brian Baird, D-Wash.), and Diane Souder (wife of Rep. Mark Souder, R-Ind.). The Master of Ceremonies for the evening&#146;s program is Rea Blakey, award-winning journalist and media consultant.</font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
