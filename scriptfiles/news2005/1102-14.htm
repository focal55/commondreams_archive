WASHINGTON - Coalition to Stop Gun Violence Executive Director Joshua Horwitz made the following statement concerning Judge Samuel Alito's nomination to the Supreme Court:

<p>"Judge Alito's dissenting opinion in United States vs. Rybar, in which he argued that the federal law prohibiting the sale or transfer of machine guns should be struck down as unconstitutional, raises serious questions about his view of the power of Congress to adopt laws designed to protect the public from crime.

<p>"His reasoning -- that he could see no direct relationship between machine gun sales and interstate commerce -- suggests a willful blindness to the simple fact that gun trafficking across state lines is a well-documented and pervasive problem.

<p>"The dissent in the Rybar case reflects a passive-aggressive approach to judicial review: he claims throughout the opinion to be open to the possibility that Congress had good reasons to conclude that the federal government should regulate automatic weapons, but then dismisses the justifications cited by Congress out of hand.

<p>"The fact that Judge Alito seemed so eager to invalidate this statute -- after it had been affirmed by all six of the other appellate courts that had considered similar challenges -- should be of grave concern to anyone who believes that judges should avoid substituting their judgment for the decisions of elected legislators."
