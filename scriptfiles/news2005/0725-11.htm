<b><a href="mailto:jshields@afsc.org">LES ROBERTS</a></b><br />
Hamid is a University of Baghdad professor and founder of New Horizons for Women, an Iraq-based nonprofit organization. As quoted in a recent <i>New York Times</i> article on violence in Iraq, she stated: "It has become part of our daily lives. Just like there is eating, sleeping, there is bombing."<br />

<br />
Hamid is part of the American Friends Service Committee's travelling exhibition "Eyes Wide Open: The Human Cost of War." Another one of the members of the tour available for interviews is Les Roberts, co-author of an independent, peer-reviewed study, "Mortality Before and After the 2003 Invasion of Iraq," which appeared in Britain's foremost medical journal, <i>The Lancet</i>, and was conducted by researchers at Columbia University and Johns Hopkins University in the United States and Al-Mustansiriya University in Baghdad. Roberts stated: "Making conservative assumptions we think that about 100,000 excess deaths, or more, have happened since the 2003 invasion of Iraq. ... Violence accounted for most of the excess deaths and air strikes from coalition forces accounted for most of the violent deaths."<br />

<b>DAHR JAMAIL</b><br />
Jamail has been an unembedded reporter in Iraq since 2003. He said: "The horrific violence the previous weekend in Iraq is the equivalent of three days straight of what happened in London where so many people were killed. Since that weekend, scores more Iraqis have been killed, while this barely makes the news. The lack of adequate coverage on the catastrophe of the occupation of Iraq continues.... "<br />

<b>RICHARD FALK</b><br />
Falk is a professor of international law at Princeton and currently visiting professor of global studies at University of California, Santa Barbara. He was a member of the panel of advocates at the World Tribunal on Iraq held in Istanbul last month. He said today: "Never before has a war aroused this level of protest on a global scale -- first to prevent it (the huge February 15, 2003, demonstrations in 80 countries) and then to condemn its inception and conduct. The World Tribunal on Iraq expresses the opposition of global civil society to the Iraq war, a project perhaps best described as a form of 'moral globalization.' ... The World Tribunal on Iraq held its culminating session in Istanbul June 24-27, the last and most elaborate of 16 condemnations of the Iraq war held worldwide in the past two years, in Barcelona, Tokyo, Brussels, Seoul, New York, London, Mumbai and other cities." [Dr. Falk is still in Istanbul.]<br />
