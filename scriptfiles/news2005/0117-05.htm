<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">VENTURA, CA and MARA, TANZANIA -- January 17 --  Global Resource Alliance (www.globalresourcealliance.org) today announced that 'AIDS Orphans Summit - Kilimanjaro' will begin on January 22, 2005. GRA Director Lyn Hebenstreit will be joined by GRA team members Tara Blasco, Tania McCracken as well as the leaders of several African non-governmental organizations on this six-day trek to the summit of Mount Kilimanjaro to raise funds for AIDS orphans and community development projects in the Mara region of Tanzania.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Mara, one of the poorest regions in Africa, nestled between Lake Victoria and the famous Serengeti Plain, is home to about 1.3 million residents. The average income in Mara is less than 39 cents a day and one out of every three children dies before the age of five.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Since 2002, GRA has provided technical and financial support to local community organizations in Mara working with those people who are most in need. GRA's goal is to empower these organizations to address the region's pressing social, economic and environmental challenges according to their own vision and their own creative potential.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Global Resource Alliance pursues a holistic approach to poverty in the Mara region providing direct assistance, promoting microfinance, and offering educational grants.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Small loans given to women that want to start their own businesses have proven to be one of the most effective ways to raise families out of poverty,&quot; said GRA Director Lyn Hebenstreit. &quot;In light of this, GRA established a 'Fund for Microfinance' to provide capital for local organizations like the Uvimaki Association for Rural Development that offers well organized microfinance services.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As an all-volunteer organization, donations received by GRA for the &quot;AIDS Orphans Summit - Kilimanjaro&quot; 2005 event go directly to programs serving AIDS orphans, their families and surrounding communities in the Mara region. After the event, Blasco, Hebenstreit &amp; McCracken will join AIDS orphans on a GRA funded Lea Mtoto Serengeti Safari to give these children an opportunity to experience their country's unique natural heritage.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Denver based Humm Foods, Inc., makers of LaraBar and Santa Barbara's The Ultimate Life, Inc., makers of the Ultimate Meal, have sponsored the Kilimanjaro event along with over a dozen small businesses in Ojai, California.</i></font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Global Resource Alliance, Inc. is an all-volunteer 501(c)3, non-profit organization headquartered in Ojai, California. It was founded in April 2002 to provide financial and technical support to community organizations in the world's least developed regions working for social, economic and environmental change. </i></font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
