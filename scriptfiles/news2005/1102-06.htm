<p>RICHMOND, Virginia - November 2 - If Jerry Kilgore has  his way, the phrase, &quot;a shot and a beer&quot; could get a whole new  meaning.</p>
<p>   Kilgore said yesterday that if he's elected governor, he'll  embrace a proposal by the Virginia Citizens Defense League (VCDL)  to broaden the state's concealed weapons laws to allow guns in  bars and restaurants. He said it on the &quot;Richmond's Morning News  with Jimmy Barrett&quot; show on Richmond news radio station WRVA.</p>
<p>   The bar and restaurant industry in Virginia and many other  states strongly oppose allowed concealed weapon permit holders to  carry concealed handguns into bars.</p>
<p>   &quot;Somebody ought to tell Mr. Kilgore that encouraging people to  bring firearms into bars is like encouraging people to pour  gasoline into a fire,&quot; said Mike Barnes, President of the Brady  Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence. &quot;It's a stupid, stupid  idea -- and that's why bar owners are so adamantly opposed.&quot;</p>
<p>   VCDL is perhaps best known for organizing &quot;open carry days&quot;  where its members gather in large groups and bring their firearms  into family restaurants, parks, and other public places.</p>
