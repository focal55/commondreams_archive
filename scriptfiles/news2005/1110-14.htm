<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->WASHINGTON - November 10 - Ralph Nader's letter to Philadelphia Eagles Chairman and CEO Jeffrey 
Lurie, and NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue follows:
<p>November 10, 2005

<p>Jeffrey Lurie<br>
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
<br>
Philadelphia Eagles

<p>Paul Tagliabue
<br>
Commissioner
<br>
National Football League

<p>Dear Messrs. Lurie and Tagliabue,

<p>I am writing to urge you to rescind the misguided suspension and planned 
inactive designation of Philadelphia Eagles wide receiver Terrell Owens. 
If the Eagles management declines to remedy its mistake, Commissioner 
Tagliabue, you should intervene to overturn the team's decision, which 
dishonors this country's traditional respect for free speech and cheats 
fans of an opportunity to see arguably the best receiver in football. 
Let him play.

<p>There is no question that Terrell Owens' comments have been boorish and 
unwarranted. However, the comments were just that -- comments.

<p>It should be the policy of the Eagles and the National Football League, 
as well as other sports teams and leagues, that players not be punished 
merely for what they say.

<p>There is a great tradition in this country of respecting free speech, 
and the Eagles and NFL should express those values in handling even 
churlish speech. This is not a matter of law: U.S. constitutional speech 
protections and most state speech protections do not extend into the 
workplace; and the NFL collective bargaining agreement affords teams the 
right to suspend players for "conduct detrimental" to their team, a 
provision that has been interpreted to cover speech and other expressive 
conduct. No, it is not a matter of law, but of principle. And the 
principle should be: employees are not penalized for speaking out, even 
if what they have to say strikes management as ill-informed or offensive.

<p>That the Eagles' proposed punishment for Owens -- a four-game suspension 
followed by an inactive designation for the rest of the season -- is so 
harsh, and so far in excess of punishments applied to other players who 
have engaged not in ill-considered speech, but criminal conduct or 
serious wrongdoing, points to how injudicious the Eagles' approach is.

<p>There is, as well, a consumer issue at stake here. Fans have purchased 
tickets for Eagles' games, in Philadelphia and elsewhere, on the 
assumption that they will see one of the game's most exciting receivers, 
so long as he is healthy enough to play. The Eagles' action denies them 
this opportunity.

<p>If the Eagles do not want Terrell Owens on their team, then they should 
release him. Instead, the Eagles propose not just to suspend him for the 
term permitted by the collective bargaining agreement, but to make him 
inactive for the duration of the season. This vengeful approach keeps 
him as an effective hostage -- kept away from the fans who would like to 
see him play.

<p>I look forward to your response, and would be pleased to discuss these 
matters with you further.

<p>Sincerely,

<p>Ralph Nader
<br>
Founder, League of Fans
