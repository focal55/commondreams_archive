<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">NEW YORK, NY -- February 15 -- The country's leading anti-war coalition will hold a key strategy and planning conference over President's Day weekend in St. Louis.  Delegates from peace groups and other organizations will converge for the Second National Assembly of United for Peace and Justice (UFPJ), February 19-21.  Since its October 2002 founding by several dozen groups, UFPJ has become the largest U.S. peace and justice coalition with over 900 local, regional and national groups under its umbrella.    </font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The assembly is the first major anti-war gathering since the reelection of George W. Bush, whose foreign policy towards Iraq sparked UFPJ's formation.  At least 400 people from around the country are expected to attend.  A broad array of groups will be represented including Military Families Speak Out, Iraq Veterans Against the War, Black Voices for Peace, American Friends Service Committee, Peace Action, and St. Louis-based Instead of War.     </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The two-and-a-half day St. Louis gathering will be a working meeting; delegates will determine strategies and campaigns for the anti-war movement in the coming period.  &quot;There's a renewed determination in the peace movement to bring the troops home, and antiwar activists will be focusing sharply on the Bush administration's vulnerabilities,&quot; said Leslie Cagan, UFPJ's National Coordinator.  Delegates will also elect a new national steering committee.   </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The conference will highlight the continued vitality of peace and justice organizing at a time when polls show a majority of Americans disapprove of Bush's handling of the war.  &quot;Building a strong anti-war movement in the world's one, unchecked, superpower is critical, said Danny Glover.  &quot;That's why I'll be in St. Louis.&quot;  Longtime social justice activist Tom Hayden will also join the conference. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">UFPJ has sparked hundreds of demonstrations including the two biggest U.S. protests against the Iraq war, in February and March 2003.  UFPJ demonstrated outside the Democratic Convention in Boston and led a half-million people marching under the banner, &quot;The World Says No to the Bush Agenda,&quot; at the Republican Convention in New York.  </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Further conference information is online at: <a href="http://www.unitedforpeace.org/article.php?id=2675" target="_new">http://www.unitedforpeace.org/article.php?id=2675</a>.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For information about media access to the conference, contact Bill Dobbs, UFPJ Media Coordinator.  <br></font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
