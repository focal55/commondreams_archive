                                              against Congressman Pombo’s

                                              Species Act today. The groups
                                              signed two joint letters to
                                              members of Congress in advance of
                                              a vote on the Pombo bill, slated
                                              for this Thursday. A new provision
                                              added to the bill exempts all
                                              pesticide decisions from

                                              and eliminates the requirement
                                              that the EPA consult with federal

                                              endangered species. We almost lost
