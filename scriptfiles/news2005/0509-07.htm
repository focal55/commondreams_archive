<p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- May 9 -- Speaking in Latvia on the 60th anniversary of the end of WWII, George Bush lectured Russia and Vladimir Putin, saying, &quot;The promise of democracy is fulfilled by minority rights, and equal justice under the rule of law, and an inclusive society in which every person belongs.&quot;</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Mr. President, you support amending the U.S. and state constitutions to deprive a minority - gay people - of a right the majority takes for granted and sees as fundamental, namely marriage. You oppose giving gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender Americans equal protections under the law from discrimination in employment, housing, and public accommodations. Your administration has relentlessly sought to exclude even the words 'gay,' 'lesbian,' 'bisexual,' and 'transgender' from any federal funding initiative.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">So, the question is, 'If minority rights, equal justice under the law, and inclusive society are good for the Baltics and Russia - why not here at home?'&quot;</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Founded in 1973, the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force was the first national lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) civil rights and advocacy organization and remains the movement's leading voice for freedom, justice, and equality. We work to build the grassroots political strength of our community by training state and local activists and leaders and organizing broad-based campaigns to defeat anti-LGBT referenda and advance pro-LGBT legislation. Our Policy Institute, the community's premiere think tank, provides research and policy analysis to support the struggle for complete equality. As part of a broader social justice movement, we work to create a world that respects and makes visible the diversity of human expression and identity where all people may fully participate in society. Headquartered in Washington, DC, we also have offices in New York City, Los Angeles, Cambridge, and Miami. </i></font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
