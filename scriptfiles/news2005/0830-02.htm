<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->CANAKKALE, Turkey - August 30 - Greenpeace activists today scaled 
the cooling tower at state-owned 'Can' coal-fired power station (1) in 
protest at the Turkish Government's continuing obsession with fossil 
fuel energy sources despite their proven role in causing the global 
threat of climate change. This action is part of the Greenpeace 
'Mediterranean Energy Tour' to urge governments to immediately act to 
stop climate change by switching to renewable energy and energy 
efficiency measures in the region.

<P>As nine climbers unfurled their message that coal causes climate 
disaster, at the entrance to the plant a further ten volunteers 
demonstrated that renewable energy solutions are ready and able to 
prevent climate change.

<P>"Climate change is now the single biggest threat facing our planet. The 
Canakkale region where the coal power plant is located has the best wind 
potential of anywhere in Turkey. Renewable energy solutions already 
exist in the Mediterranean, but governments seem to continuing their 
dependence on dangerous fossil fuels," said Greenpeace International 
energy campaigner Jim Footner.

<P>The Greenpeace vessel 'Anna' launched its visit to Turkey on Saturday 
and will sail to Lebanon, Israel and Egypt to raise the urgency of 
dangerous climate change in the Mediterranean region and to highlight 
the importance of public, political and the power sector engagement with 
this global crisis.

<P>Renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar, have a huge role to 
play in combating climate change. Wind energy is one of the fastest 
growing sectors in the world. "There is enough renewable energy 
potential to meet the entire electricity needs in the region with more 
to spare. But this potential will continue to be wasted unless 
governments end their addiction to fossil fuels and start seriously 
addressing the obstacles that stand in the way of a clean energy 
future," added Footner.

<P>"Our vision for the future is a common region based on a hundred percent 
of renewable energy", he concluded.

<P>Greenpeace is an independent, campaigning organisation, which uses 
non-violent, creative confrontation to expose global environmental 
problems, and to force solutions essential to a green and peaceful future.
