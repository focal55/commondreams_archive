<td colspan="2"><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">NORTHWEST ATLANTIC  - August 8  - Greenpeace called on Iceland and other members of the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organisation (NAFO) to get their deep-sea fisheries mismanagement under control by branding the side of the Petur Jonsson, a 64-meter Icelandic bottom trawler with the word &quot;Legal?&quot; in international waters of the Northwest Atlantic.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;We want a UN moratorium on high-seas bottom trawling now,&quot; said Bunny McDiarmid of Greenpeace International. &quot;We need to force decision makers to sort out the mismanagement of deep-sea fisheries and to give scientists the necessary time to identify which vulnerable areas need protection from this destructive fishing practice&quot; she said.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">NAFO's &quot;management&quot; of shrimp in international waters of the Flemish Cap (1) is not done by setting a catch limit, but rather by allocating a number of days and vessels to member countries fishing in the area. Iceland has used the objection procedure (2) in the NAFO to opt out of this effort allocation scheme and set its own quota.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Why is it legal for member countries to opt out of management decisions made collectively by NAFO? Why is it legal for members of NAFO to then set their own quotas and ignore scientific advice? And why is it legal to bottom trawl in areas where soft corals and other vulnerable deep-sea life also exists and could be lost forever with one trawl?&quot; asked McDiarmid.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Greenpeace ship Esperanza is in the international waters of the Northwest Atlantic to highlight and document the activities of the bottom trawling fleets. Greenpeace has visited four shrimpers and observed seven bottom trawling ships in the same area of the Flemish Cap last week (3). Skippers on board shrimp trawlers in the Flemish Cap have told Greenpeace that over the years the shrimp are getting smaller and the boats are getting bigger. The use of larger boats is to get around the restriction on boat numbers and days. Bigger boats mean that they can trawl and haul more than one net at a time. In 2003 the catch increased to 62,000 MT, from 49,000 the year before; this was largely due to Norway, doubling their catch by setting three nets at a time (4).</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Petur Jonsson is the only Icelandic shrimp trawler currently in the area, although a number of other Lithuanian and Estonian flagged shrimpers appear to be either operated or owned by Icelandic interests (5).</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;With around 30 tons of gear dropping onto the seabed three times a day and approximately 12 square kilometers of the seabed being trawled every 24 hours by each trawler, it's not hard to see why this is considered to be one of the most destructive fishing practices around,&quot; concluded McDiarmid.</font><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"></font></p>

(1) The Esperanza is in division 3M of the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organisation (NAFO)<br>
(2) The objection procedure in NAFO means a member country can simply state they disagree with a decision within 60 days, and they are then not bound by it.<br>

(5) The shrimp fishery on the Flemish Cap began in 1993 following the collapse of the cod fishery. Today Estonia, Denmark (Faroe Islands), Norway and Iceland take the largest catch and their markets are predominantly Europe, Japan and the USA. In 2001 the shrimp catch from the Flemish Cap was the largest reported bottom trawl fishery in international waters.</font></p>
