<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->WASHINGTON - August 17 - The Moving Ideas Network released a report today, "<a href="http://www.movingideas.org/content/en/report_content/juvenile_justice.htm" target="_new">Breaking Through: New Hope for Delinquent Kids</a>",
which provides links to The American Prospect's special report on juvenile justice reform and resources from the progressive community. The report focuses on programs and research that demonstrate the benefits of addressing the underlying issues of kids' delinquent behavior rather than merely locking them up.

<p>"As legislatures move toward placing increasingly younger teens in adult criminal court, social and biological evidence suggests moving in the other direction," says Jeffrey Fagan of the National Research Council. "It's time for the law to change course and follow the science."

<p>The report provides a history of juvenile justice in the U.S. and analyzes the juvenile justice reform victories in Missouri, Louisiana, and Santa Cruz, California. In his article, Ellis Cose talks about the racial disparities of the current system, and Sam Rosenfeld reports on the large jump in numbers of kids with mental health problems entering the juvenile justice system.

<p>The report also discusses the mounting evidence demonstrating that the current system is creating more problems and more dangerous criminals. Laurence Steinberg of the MacArthur Foundation says it's because the current system provides delinquent kids with an expanded antisocial network, derails their normal psychological development, makes them more dependent, and allows them to learn from the most dangerous criminals.

<p>Experts and public relations contacts available to speak to the press are located in <a href="http://www.movingideas.org/content/en/for_the_press.htm" target="_new">Moving Ideas' Progressive Policy Experts Database</a>.
