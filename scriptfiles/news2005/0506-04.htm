<p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- May 6 -- A big crowd of reform activists and organizations from across New York State converged on the State Capitol in Albany on Tuesday, demanding that state legislators act on a host of proposals to improve government, including redistricting, election reform and government ethics.</font></p><p align="LEFT"> </p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">New York Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver (D), state Comptroller Alan Hevesi (D), Senate Minority Leader David Patterson (D) and Assembly Minority Leader Charles Nesbitt (R) spoke at a rally, unveiling their reform platforms to 150 diverse activists who bussed in from cities across New York.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At the same time, Gov. George Pataki (R) was in a news conference nearby signing into law one of Common Cause New York's top ten reforms: a bill to improve freedom of information laws.</font></p><p align="LEFT"> </p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Pressure from citizen activists like those in New York is making a difference in state capitols across the country, and in Washington DC. That's where Republican leaders just last week took the extraordinary step of reversing damaging ethics rules changes forced on the House in January that made it nearly impossible to investigate an ethics complaint against members of Congress</font></p><p align="LEFT"> </p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Common Cause New York and our 37 other state offices still have much more to accomplish, including real reforms to protect the integrity of our electoral system. But we are on our way to a more open and accountable government, because activists like you are demanding change.  Let's keep up the momentum!<br></font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
