<p>WASHINGTON - December 23 - Media Matters for  America today announced the winner of its 2005 "Misinformer of  the Year" award. After much deliberation and a thorough -- and  somewhat painful --review of the many distortions, false  statements, and instances of misinformation we have corrected  during the year, MSNBC's Chris Matthews takes home the prize.</p>
<p>   In 2005, Matthews called the majority of his fellow Americans  "real whack-jobs"; praised a speech by President Bush as  "brilliant" even before it was delivered; said that Bush  sometimes "glimmers" with "sunny nobility"; and gushed at having  his picture taken with the president, adding that Bush "belongs  on Mount Rushmore." Matthews made false claims about Democrats,  former ambassador Joseph C. Wilson IV, Iraqi elections,  Catholics, and the Iraqi insurgency, and he derided people with  sneering insults, calling them "witchy" and "thimble-wit(s)."</p>
<p>   "Last year, we named Bill O'Reilly the 'Misinformer of the  Year.' O'Reilly remained true to his roots and continued to  spread conservative misinformation in 2005," said David Brock,  President and CEO of Media Matters. "However, Chris Matthews is  viewed by many as a trustworthy source of information, which  makes his egregious statements and inaccuracies even more  astonishing. We will continue to monitor Matthews's shows and  point out every instance of conservative misinformation."  </p>
<p>   Matthews -- host of MSNBC's Hardball with Chris Matthews and  NBC's syndicated program The Chris Matthews Show -- is a former  presidential speechwriter and congressional staffer, a best- selling author, and recipient of The Washington Post's "Crystal  Ball" award for his successful predictions of U.S. presidential  elections. In addition, he can now claim the title of 2005  "Misinformer of the Year." </p>
<p>   Media Matters for America has compiled a list of some of his  most outrageous, false, and misleading claims of 2005. Without  further ado, let's play hardball:</p>
<p>  -- Chris Hearts George. Matthews has routinely expressed his  admiration for President Bush, calling a Bush speech "brilliant"  even before it was given and accusing those who dislike the  president of being "whack-jobs"; he also said that Bush sometimes  "glimmers" with "sunny nobility"; and, recounting his experience  at a White House party, Matthews said Bush "belongs on Mount  Rushmore."   </p>
<p>   -- Matthews's panels consistently skew to the right. Matthews  has hosted numerous MSNBC panels that contained far more  conservative commentators than progressives. In 2005, the trend  was especially prevalent during MSNBC's presidential inauguration  coverage; and both before and after Bush's State of the Union  address. While moderating discussion panels on Hardball, Matthews  has repeatedly emphasized the liberal allegiances of progressive  guests, while failing to note that other guests on the same panel  were Republican. </p>
<p>   -- Matthews falsely claimed Democrats accused Alito of being  "lenient on the mob." During MSNBC's coverage of the nomination  of Judge Samuel A. Alito Jr. to the Supreme Court, Matthews  repeatedly misrepresented a document about Alito that was  circulated by Democrats. Waving the document around on camera --  but not quoting directly from it -- Matthews falsely claimed that  it accused Alito of being "lenient on the mob" and made the  baseless assertion that, by mentioning a case involving organized  crime, Democrats were "go(ing) after (Alito's Italian)  ethnicity." In fact, the document, available here, made no  mention of Alito's ethnicity and simply noted that he lost a  high-profile mob case -- not that he was "lenient" on anybody.  (Hardball, 10/31/05) </p>
<p>   -- Matthews falsely attacked Wilson over Niger trip's genesis.  Matthews falsely accused former ambassador Joseph C. Wilson IV of  claiming during his July 6 Meet the Press appearance and in his  July 6 New York Times op-ed that Vice President Dick Cheney had  sent him on his February 2002 trip to investigate whether Iraq  had tried to acquire uranium from Niger. In fact, Wilson never  made such a claim in either his Times op-ed or his appearance on  Meet the Press. Wilson wrote in his Times op-ed that CIA  officials, not the vice president, asked him to go to Niger;  discussing his op-ed on Meet the Press, Wilson said that the "the  question (of Iraq seeking uranium from Niger) was asked of the  CIA by the office of the vice president." (The Chris Matthews  Show, 7/24/05) </p>
<p>   -- Matthews made false claim about January Iraqi election. In  praising the Iraqi election in January, Matthews falsely claimed  that no insurgent attacks had occurred at polling places on  election day. In fact, attacks on Iraqi polling places were  widely reported during the January 30 elections. (Hardball,  1/31/05) </p>
<p>   -- Matthews distorted poll data to claim Catholics are  increasingly Republican. Matthews cherry-picked poll data to  support his misleading claim that Catholics have voted  increasingly Republican since 1960. In fact, exit poll data  indicate that Catholics are a swing constituency: In every  presidential election since 1980, a majority or plurality of  Catholics have voted for the candidate who won the popular vote,  including Bill Clinton in 1992 and 1996 and Al Gore in 2000. (The  Chris Matthews Show, 4/10/05) </p>
