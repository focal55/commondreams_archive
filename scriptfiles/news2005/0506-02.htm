<p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- May 6 -- People from around the country are signing up at <a href="http://www.countingthecost.org/" target="_new">www.countingthecost.org</a> to wear numbers symbolizing the over 100,000 civilians and soldiers estimated to have died because of the U.S. invasion of Iraq.  Motivated by new information on the numbers of deaths in Iraq, and the lack of national discussion about this tragedy, participants from Alaska to Arizona, Boston to Baltimore, are signing up to participate in a simple but dramatic gesture.  On May 15th, in localities across the country, Counting the Cost participants will wear their numbers and take part in demonstrations - some will silently vigil, others will stage large public die-ins, some will wear their numbers to church or college graduations, and some will simply go through their daily lives and explain the significance of the numbers they wear to their neighbors and passers-by.  No matter how they spend the day, Counting The Cost participants will stand together in their belief that we must bring the U.S. occupation of Iraq to an end now.    </font></p><p align="LEFT"> </p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Counting the Cost campaign intends to use any surplus funds from registration contributions to provide humanitarian aid to Iraqi civilians and support to further organizing in the U.S. against the war. &#147;Even though our efforts will be only a small bandaid compared to the need, we believe it is vital for U.S. citizens to make an effort to reach and offer help to counter the harm our government is doing.&#148; said Annie Juergens-Behr, Counting the Cost organizer.</font></p><p align="LEFT"> </p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The efforts of Counting the Cost were inspired by the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health study which appeared last October in the English medical journal, the Lancet. The study concludes that over 100,000 people have died as a result of the invasion and occupation of Iraq. (For the complete Johns Hopkins study see <a href="http://www.countingthecost.org/images/Mortality-in-Iraq.pdf" target="_new">http://www.countingthecost.org/images/Mortality-in-Iraq.pdf</a>)  &#147;The public has been led to believe the war was nearly cost-free &#147;said Philadelphian Josh Markel, one of Counting the Cost&#146;s originators. &#147; The Hopkins study got a lot of coverage in other countries, but it has been largely ignored here in the U.S.&#148;</font></p><p align="LEFT"> </p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The event mourns the U.S. soldiers, the Iraqis, the military and civilians from the Coalition countries, the aid workers, the UN staff, the journalists, and the contractors who have died during the war and occupation in Iraq. &#147;They will try to forget the faces, the memory, the boots of all of these dear souls, and the 100,000 Iraqis who lie in their own land&#148; said Celeste Zappala, co-founder of Gold Star Families for Peace, whose son Sherwood Baker was killed April 26, 2004, serving with the Pennsylvania National Guard in Iraq.</font></p><p align="LEFT"> </p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">While the U.S. media focus occasionally on American deaths in Iraq, the organizers of &#147;Counting the Cost&#148; are determined to bring the Iraqi deaths to U.S. attention as well.  Before her recent tragic death by a suicide bomber attack, Marla Ruzicka, founder of Campaign for Innocent Victims In Combat, forced the U.S. military to admit that they indeed keep track of Iraqi deaths. This admission comes despite the fact that Gen. Tommy Franks has said &#147;we don't do body counts.&#148;</font></p><p align="LEFT"> </p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;The government has prohibited photographs of the caskets with the military dead being returned to the U.S. The military claims there is no &#147;body count&#148; of  the Iraqi dead. We believe that the U.S. people should know the true cost of the war and demand an end.&#148; said Mary Day Kent, Director of the Women&#146;s International League for Peace and Freedom, one of the sponsors for the Counting the Cost project. Other endorsers are Veterans for Peace, Gold Star Families for Peace, Brandywine Peace Community, Global Exchange, The Shalom Center and the National Lawyers Guild.</font></p><p align="LEFT"> </p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Counting the Cost will be holding events to mourn the dead and call for an end to the war in a growing number of cities and communities. Philadelphia, Baltimore, Santa Cruz, California, and Burlington, Vt. are among the locations.</font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
