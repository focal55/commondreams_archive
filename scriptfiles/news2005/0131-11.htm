<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- January 31 -- Congressman Dennis J. Kucinich (D-OH), the Ranking Member on the House Government Reform Subcommittee on National Security, Emerging Threats and International Relations, today demanded a broad investigation of the $9 billion in missing reconstruction funds in Iraq, including a criminal investigation and Congressional hearings.  </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Kucinich will send two letters today calling for a full investigation into the missing $9 billion in funds in Iraq. One letter will be sent to Congressman Christopher Shays (R-CT), Chairman of the House Government Reform Subcommittee on National Security, Emerging Threats and International Relations, requesting an immediate Congressional hearing. The second letter will be sent to United States Attorney General-designate Alberto Gonzales demanding a criminal investigation, including a grand jury, by the United States Department of Justice.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;In view of this Administration's tendency for covert or secret operations, there is no assurance that these funds were not misused for illegal or unauthorized activities,&quot; stated Kucinich. &quot;The Administration, the Department of Defense, and Coalition Provisional Authority must be held directly responsible for this staggering lack of accountability of $9 billion. If ever there was a reason for a grand jury to start asking questions of high ranking federal government officials, this is it.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Kucinich's actions followed a report issued yesterday, by the special inspector general (IG) for Iraq, Stuart Bowen Jr., which stated the U.S. occupation authority in Iraq was unable to keep track of nearly $9 billion in funds it transferred to government ministries between October 2003 and June 2004.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;It is simply not believable that the Administration lost track of every dime of the funds. The Administration willfully turned a blind eye and allowed the misuse of funds, and now must be held accountable,&quot; continued Kucinich. <br></font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
