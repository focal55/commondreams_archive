<p>WASHINGTON - December 20 - Today, Earthjustice  joined four other national environmental groups in announcing  formal opposition to the nomination of Judge Samuel Alito Jr. to  a lifetime seat on the Supreme Court. This is the first time in  nearly 20 years that Earthjustice has opposed a Supreme Court  nominee. </p>
<p>   &quot;America depends upon Supreme Court justices to uphold and  enforce our nation's environmental safeguards and to protect the  rights of all Americans. We cannot afford to have someone like  Judge Alito deciding which rights will be protected, and which  will be thrown out,&quot; said Buck Parker, Executive Director of  Earthjustice. &quot;After a careful consideration of Judge Alito's  record, we believe that, if confirmed to the Supreme Court, he  would vote to roll back key protections for public health and the  environment.&quot;</p>
<p>   The last Supreme Court nominee to be opposed by Earthjustice  and other national environmental groups was Robert Bork,  nominated in 1987. Earthjustice did not oppose any of the eight  Supreme Court nominees between Judge Bork and Judge Alito.</p>
<p>   Like Judge Bork, Judge Alito has an extreme record on issues  that are central to fundamental legal safeguards for public  health and our environment, including the scope of the Commerce  Clause, which is the constitutional basis for most federal  environmental laws. Judge Alito's positions also threaten the  ability of average Americans and government agencies to ensure  that these laws are enforced. </p>
<p>   For example, one of his dissenting opinions concluded that a  Congressional ban on possession and transfer of machine guns was  unconstitutional under the Commerce Clause, contradicting many  circuit courts of appeal decisions. Alito's views indicate that  he would support Commerce Clause challenges by polluters and  developers to public health and environmental laws that Americans  have relied upon for decades, including the Clean Water Act, the  Clean Air Act the Endangered Species Act, and the Safe Drinking  Water Act. </p>
<p>   In other cases, Alito provided the deciding vote in favor of  polluters to overturn pro-environmental actions by the U.S.  Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). One of these cases  overturned an EPA emergency Safe Drinking Water Act clean-up  order that protected drinking water for 180,000 people from toxic  pollution. Alito also joined another 2-1 Clean Water Act decision  that unfairly barred average Americans from court, by creating  constitutional barriers that were later essentially overruled by  the Supreme Court.</p>
<p>   &quot;Judge Alito's record indicates that he would pursue his own  extreme legal theories to create new barriers that prevent the  enactment and enforcement of national laws that protect families  and communities from pollution,&quot; said Glenn Sugameli,  Earthjustice Senior Judicial Counsel. &quot;There is too much at  stake; Judge Alito's nomination must be defeated.&quot;</p>
