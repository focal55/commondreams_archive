<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - August 24 - On the eve of a deadline requiring the USDA's National Organic Program 
        (NOP) to respond to a federal court complaint filed in June by the *Organic 
        Consumers Association* *(OCA),* representing more than 500,000 members, 
        and *Dr. Bronner's Magic Soaps* */ **Dr. Bronner's &amp; Sun Dog's Magic* 
        (<a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&ct=res&cd=1&url=http%3A//www.ahpa.org" target="_blank">www.drbronnersundog.com</a>), 
        the USDA has directed in a memo to organic certifiers that _certified 
        non-food products specifically including personal care may represent that 
        they are NOP certified &quot;organic&quot; or &quot;made with organic,&quot; 
        and display the USDA organic seal, so long as such products are certified 
        to meet the NOP standards for organic agricultural products.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;We 
        are pleased that USDA has decided to follow the law and promote the interests 
        of consumers by recognizing that certified organic producers are indeed 
        able to access the NOP program and display the USDA organic seal,&quot; 
        said Joe Sandler, the lead attorney handling the complaint. USDA NOP's 
        directive puts to rest the USDA's attempt earlier this year to prevent 
        certified organic non-food products from accessing the NOP program and 
        displaying the USDA organic seal. This would have reversed the USDA's 
        long-standing policy that explicitly /invited/ companies to certify non-food 
        products to NOP standards and earn the USDA organic seal. Such a reversal 
        would have destroyed good faith investments while depriving consumers 
        of the ability to tell the difference between a mislabeled or misbranded 
        &quot;organic&quot; personal care product from a bona fide NOP certified 
        organic product. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The complaint, 
        which will likely be withdrawn by OCA/Dr. Bronner's following settlement 
        talks over the next 30 days, was part of <a href="http://www.organicconsumers.org/bodycare/" target="_self">OCA's 
        Coming Clean Campaign</a> for strong organic standards, under which thousands 
        of consumers and hundreds of businesses have been mobilized. &quot;This 
        is a major victory for organic consumers who rely on NOP certification 
        to ensure that their personal care and other non-food consumable products 
        like pet foods contain real organic ingredients free from unnecessary 
        synthetic ingredients,&quot; said Ronnie Cummins, OCA founder and National 
        Director.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Thanks 
        to USDA's wise decision, brands such as Dr. Bronner's &amp; Sun Dog's 
        Magic that support organic agriculture and farmers with all the integrity 
        the National Organic Program intends, can continue to display the USDA 
        organic seal,&quot; said David Bronner, President of Dr. Bronner's/Sun 
        Dog that manufacturers certified organic lotions, balms and soaps made 
        with organic oils. &quot;We look forward to an amicable settlement of 
        our lawsuit against the USDA and are thrilled to have played a part in 
        preserving NOP access for certified non-food products.&quot; Lynn Betz, 
        Founder and President of *<a href="http://www.sensibilitysoaps.com/" target="_blank">Sensibility 
        Soaps</a>* that produces over 20 certified organic personal care products, 
        stated: &quot;I commend NOP Administrator Barbara Robinson and USDA's 
        'change of heart' in regards to certifying personal care products under 
        the National Organic Program. Supporting the integrity of certified organic 
        claims in the marketplace is of immeasurable benefit to organic consumers, 
        farmers and suppliers as well as organic personal care manufacturers.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Congresswoman 
        Melissa Hart (R-PA) in whose district Sensibility Soaps is located was 
        a leading champion for organic consumers and industry in Congress to ensure 
        that access to the NOP would be preserved for qualified non-food products. 
        In a letter Rep. Hart stated, &quot;In addition to business concerns it 
        is important for consumers to see the USDA organic seal when selecting 
        personal care products because many individuals who purchase organic products 
        do so because they are allergic to certain processed ingredients that 
        are often in non-organic products.&quot; Other organic caucus members 
        in Congress were also very supportive. Other organizations and businesses 
        that played an important role in the USDA's decision included: the <a href="http://www.ota.com" target="_blank">Organic 
        Trade Association</a>, <a href="http://ccof.org/" target="_blank">California 
        Certified Organic Farmers</a>, <a href="http://terressentials.com/" target="_blank">Terressentials</a> 
        and the <a href="http://www.ahpa.org/" target="_blank">American Herbal 
        Products Association</a></font>
