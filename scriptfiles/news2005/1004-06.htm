<p>WASHINGTON - Greenpeace today reached Egypt on the 
final leg of its 'Peaceful Energy Tour' in the Mediterranean region. 
Campaigners will be visiting Cairo and Alexandria to highlight the 
threats and impacts of climate change in Egypt.

<p>"As the leader in renewable energy in Africa and the Arab world, Egypt 
is crucial in alleviating the impacts of climate change. The main cause 
of climate change is our use of fossil fuels as a source of energy; a 
switch to clean sources of renewable energy such as wind, solar and 
modern biomass, offers the promise of a sustainable future," said Wael 
Hmaidan, Greenpeace Mediterranean campaigner.

<p>Egypt is also one of the major countries, which will suffer dramatic 
climate change impacts in the region, specifically the Nile delta, which 
is crucial to the survival of the country's people and their economy.

<p>"Egypt is more than 95% desert, and all of its economy, agriculture and 
population is concentrated along the lower Nile. If the Nile recedes, 
Egypt would suffer dramatic losses," Hmaidan explained.

<p>Climate scientists have warned that the Nile not only could suffer a 
decrease in water flow of up to 75% by the end of the century, but also 
a rise in sea levels would threaten to flood around 20% of the Nile 
delta. With further threats from increasing desertification, between two 
and fourteen million people could become refugees due to the 
environmental damage.

<p>Greenpeace is calling on the Egyptian Government to push the leaders of 
the region and the world to adopt serious renewable energy commitments 
if they want their country to survive. The solar resources in Egypt 
alone are enough to power the Mediterranean region, Europe, and Africa 
combined.

<p>"Although climate change impacts us all, the major victims are in 
developing countries where the economies and infrastructures are 
fragile. We have so far been disappointed by developed countries that 
are refusing to combat climate change effectively, such as the United 
States and Australia," said Bruno Rebelle, Greenpeace International 
program director.

<p>Greenpeace is planning a week of engagements to discuss the issues with 
politicians, farmers and supporters, who can visit an exhibition in 
Cairo and Alexandria on the impacts of climate change.

<p>Greenpeace is an independent, campaigning organization, which uses 
non-violent, creative communication tools to put the spotlight on global 
environmental problems, and to drive towards solutions essential for a 
green and peaceful future.
