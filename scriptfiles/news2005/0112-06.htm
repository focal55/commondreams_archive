<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- January 12 -- People For the American Way Foundation (PFAWF), one of the nation&#146;s most influential progressive public advocacy organizations, will gather a group of young, progressive leaders for its first annual leadership training summit in Washington, DC next month.</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Young People For (YP4) will welcome 125 outstanding students chosen from 40 campuses in California, Florida, Illinois, Michigan, New York, Ohio, Texas and the District of Columbia.  The summit, to be held January 13 through January 17 will feature training sessions, speakers, and hands-on working sessions as the students develop action plans for progressive initiatives on the local, state and national level.  The following are among the tentatively scheduled speakers: producer and PFAWF founder Norman Lear, actor and PFAWF board member Alec Baldwin, Congressman Kendrick Meek, Nation Washington editor David Corn, American Prospect executive editor Michael Tomasky, and Media Matters for America president David Brock.  Additional high-profile speakers will be announced.</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">YP4 is a long-term, youth-driven program that identifies and invests in campus activists and leaders and connects them to others in the progressive movement.  The program will provide a network for emerging leaders and help them cultivate skills in message development, media and communications, community activism, fundraising, research, and leadership.</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The first 125 fellows will participate in a series of trainings on critical issues such as civil rights and liberties, the federal judiciary, reproductive choice, free speech, public education, voting rights and civic engagement.  Fellows will also engage in skills trainings including: framing a message, on-line organizing, advocacy training, coalition building, fundraising and public speaking. After the summit, YP4 will continue with a series of on-line courses, town hall meetings and issue blogs. The fellows will form the core of an expanding network of progressives that will expand with a new class of fellows each year. </font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;Young People For will connect young progressive leaders and give them access to training and resources.  We are confident that YP4 fellows will be among the future leaders who will guarantee the strength and vitality of the progressive movement for generations to come,&#148; said Ralph G. Neas, president of PFAWF.</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;Young People For will nurture a community of progressive leaders who will help one another fight for progressive causes.   We are going to give them the professional skills that they need to be effective advocates,&#148; said Iara Peng, YP4 project director.  &#147;Armed with natural leadership ability, professional skills and knowledge, these young adults will be leaders for a lifetime.&#148;</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Peng noted that far-right organizations have invested heavily in organizations to promote their causes on college campuses for 30 years, and that spending on such programs now tops $36 million annually.  That investment has created a network of right-wing politicians, pundits and think-tank members whose ranks include Grover Norquist, Karl Rove, Ralph Reed, Ann Coulter, Tucker Carlson, and many lesser-known ultra-conservatives.  </font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;Young People For will provide progressive college students with a framework for exchanging ideas, creating networks, developing initiatives, and cooperating to achieve common goals.  We want young progressives to know they&#146;re not alone,&#148; said Peng. <br></font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
