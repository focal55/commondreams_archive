<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- January 19 -- The Educational Fund to Stop Gun Violence today characterized a new report by the Maryland State Police recommending the repeal of the state's comprehensive ballistic identification system as &quot;politically-motivated junk science.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The report's recommendation should come as no surprise to anyone who has followed the issue in Maryland.  In 2003, Governor Ehrlich, who has long supported the gun lobby, actively lobbied against efforts to expand the ballistic identification system despite the system's endorsement by David Mitchell, the former head of the Maryland State Police.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The new report questioning the effectiveness of Maryland's ballistic identification system is nothing more than a blatant attempt to cover up the fact that the Governor and the Maryland State Police have failed to properly implement this important crime solving technology,&quot; said Josh Horwitz, Executive Director of The Educational Fund to Stop Gun Violence.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The report acknowledges that the system is severely underutilized, that technicians were never properly trained, that software and other equipment was never updated, and that the state police failed to institute appropriate quality controls to prevent improper data from entering the system.  These are not failures of ballistic identification, but rather reflect a complete abdication of responsibility by the state police and a total lack of leadership from Governor Ehrlich to ensure effective implementation of the technology,&quot; said Horwitz. &quot;Instead of calling for its repeal, the state police ought to use the technology to its full crime-solving potential.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Educational Fund to Stop Gun Violence's report, &quot;Cracking the Case: The Crime-Solving Promise of Ballistic Identification,&quot; details how ballistic technology can help law enforcement solve gun crimes.  Key features of the report, which can be found at www.FindTheGun.com, include:</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Detailed summaries and images of firearms and ammunition, and an in-depth look at how forensic experts currently use ballistic evidence to solve crimes.An overview of the future of ballistic identification technology, including exciting new advances in microstamping. Responses to criticisms leveled against ballistic identification technology by the gun lobby and others. Seven policy recommendations to help law enforcement access and utilize crime-solving tools. A comprehensive glossary of firearm and ballistic identification-related terminology. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>The Educational Fund to Stop Gun Violence was founded in 1978 as a nonprofit educational charity dedicated to ending firearm violence, particularly as it affects children. Our mission is to stop gun violence by fostering effective community and national action.
