<p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- April 21 -- There has been a lot of noise from conservative voices calling for privatization of various government programs, particularly Social Security.  The American Prospect just released an in-depth report illustrating the positive role of government and the many ways it runs programs better and more efficiently than private entities would.  Moving Ideas, a project of the Prospect, provides links to more resources and reading material in their companion piece.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Tax &amp; Spend: The Unapologetic Case for Big Government (<a href="http://www.movingideas.org/content/en/report_content/govt_good.htm" target="_new">http://www.movingideas.org/content/en/report_content/govt_good.htm</a>) discusses the positive societal goals that government programs uniquely address. The report also dispels some of the stereotypes associated with big government programs, such as the mistaken belief that government programs are less efficient and create waste.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The claim that social programs are 'inefficient' is often just a politically correct way of saying that they don't follow the usual market logic of giving the most to those with the greatest means,&quot; Jacob Hacker asserts.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In his piece, Geoffrey Nunberg explains that the government has a role to play in the struggle between the people and the powerful, that government protects the people from unfettered economic forces.  In the Social Security debate, he says that, &quot;What it comes down to is whether voters trust the government or Wall Street fund managers with their money.&quot;</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Tax &amp; Spend: The Unapologetic Case for Big Government&quot; is available at<a href="http://www.movingideas.org/content/en/report_content/govt_good.htm" target="_new"> http://www.movingideas.org/content/en/report_content/govt_good.htm</a>. </font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Experts and public relations contacts available to speak to the press are located in Moving Ideas' Progressive Policy Experts Database at <a href="http://www.movingideas.org/content/en/for_the_press.htm" target="_new">http://www.movingideas.org/content/en/for_the_press.htm</a>.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>As the leading source for easily searched and sorted progressive policy information, Moving Ideas provides the background information for citizen activism via the Internet.
