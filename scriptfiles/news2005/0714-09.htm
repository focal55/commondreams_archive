<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - July 14 - Today, the Rev. Dr. C. Welton Gaddy, President of The Interfaith Alliance, responded to the announcement that leaders of the religious right will host - in a church -- another simulcast television program, &quot;Justice Sunday II.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Here we go again!&quot; Rev. Gaddy said.  &quot;And, this time the imagery and the implications of the message advanced by leaders of the religious right are more offensive, sacrilegious, and undemocratic than those so integral to Justice Sunday I.  </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Right now, the most serious threats to the fundamental rights and liberties in our nation are not coming from a lack of God's interest but from a small group of religious right leaders who have assumed the mantle of national religious authorities and seek to impose on the whole nation and its constitution their particular views on religion, the courts, politics, and justice. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;One can only wonder about the sincerity of the prayerful plea, &quot;God save the United States and this Honorable Court&quot; when members of the religious right have disparaged certain members of the Supreme Court and some even have prayed for the demise of these members. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;There is no confusion, only manipulation-a manipulation of the holy name of God and a manipulation of the United States Constitution-in the implicit suggestion that only a Supreme Court nominee who wins the approval of the religious right is a suitable, God-endorsed candidate for the highest court in our nation. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Let us get the language straight.  Those of us who are concerned about the status of religious liberty in this nation do not want 'activist judges' ruling on the constitutionality of various issues.  We want conservative judges who will not waver in providing for the citizens of this nation religious liberty which means, one, the guarantee of no establishment of religion and, thus, no entanglement between the institutions of religion and government, and, two, the free exercise of religion for people of all faiths and people of no faith and providing for the citizens of this nation the basic civil rights for which the Constitution was written apart from whether or not any person meets the litmus tests of acceptability established by the religious right. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Neither the religions nor the government of this nation will be well served by such pontificating by the religious right. We urge the Family Research Council and its colleagues, please don't put our nation through this again.&quot;</font></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p align="CENTER"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">###</font></p><!-- #EndEditable -->
