<p>	WASHINGTON - December 5 - On December 5, 2005 the National Workers’ Rights Board released Wal-Mart: A People’s Perspective, its final report summarizing the testimony and recommendations of their hearing on Wal-Mart that occurred in St Louis, MO this past September.  Wal-Mart has been criticized for leading the attack against workers and their families, setting trends in union-avoidance tactics, gender discrimination, withholding healthcare, and the environment among other things.  The National Workers’ Rights Board hearing was held in response to requests from both workers and community members whose lives have been dramatically impacted by the company.

 

<p>	The resounding call from the testifiers and board panelists alike was to make Wal-Mart more accountable to its workers and the surrounding communities.

 

<p>	“Wal-Mart has a broad impact on working people both within the United States and overseas,” said Fred Azcarate, the executive director of Jobs with Justice.  “It is our hope that the largest private sector employer in the United States will set higher standards for the retail industry and become a real ally to working families.”

 

<p>	After hearing all of the testimony, the National Workers’ Rights Board panelists agreed to not only release a report summarizing their findings, but to send their recommendations to H. Lee Scott, Wal-Mart’s CEO.  The panel’s recommendations included recognizing the unions that workers form, respecting community interests when building, and improving their environmental practices.

 

<p>	“It’s not about stopping Wal-Mart’s expansion in the end,” said Rick Smith who testified on behalf of the Wal-Mart Workers’ Association in Florida.  “It’s about making them a better company and corporate citizen.”

 

<p>	The National Workers’ Rights Board, a project of Jobs with Justice, is made up of high profile community leaders, nationally known academics and writers, celebrities, members of Congress, denominational leaders in the faith community as well as some representatives from local Workers’ Rights Boards.  Workers, both union and non-union, approach the National Workers’ Rights Board to seek support from the broader community around issues affecting them as a result of their employer.
