<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DENVER -- March 26 -- A group of citizens concerned about the future of Social Security responded to President Bush's call to participate in his Town-Hall-Style &quot;Conversation on Social Security,&quot; in Denver on Monday, March 21, but were forcibly removed from the event for unstated reasons.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The three legally obtained tickets to attend through Republican Congressman Bob Beauprez' office.   After being seated in the audience they were forcibly removed before the President arrived.  The three people removed were not disruptive in any way nor did they carry signs or take any actions that challenged the President.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;I guess they figured out a way to read my thoughts, and that was enough to get me thrown out from the 'conversation,'&quot; said Alex Young, forcibly removed from the event for no reason.<br></font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The President's thought-police are doing an excellent job of monitoring, identifying and cleansing those who disagree with his Social Security proposal from these taxpayer-funded events.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This President's Social Security road show takes place in a time of widespread media manipulation including pro-Bush porn stars being given White House press passes, columnists being paid to pitch the administration's proposals, fake news in the form of video news releases, and now a &quot;Town Hall&quot; charade staged so the media can market the President's Social Security proposal.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">From the 2001 energy crisis, fraudulent WMD claims and inflated election year terrorist threats, to a trumped-up Social Security crisis designed to scare Americans into handing over the trust fund to Wall Street, the administration's record of manipulating public fear through the media is a growing national disgrace.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We view this action as a glaring example of the lack of respect for the US Constitution and the First Amendment right to free speech,&quot; said Leslie Weise, also forcibly removed from the event.<br></font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
