<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- March 2 -- Robin Brand, vice president for campaigns &amp; elections at the Gay &amp; Lesbian Victory Fund, made the following statement today regarding Tiffany Muller, the only openly gay or lesbian official in Kansas. Muller is running to retain her seat on the Topeka (Kan.) City Council, home of anti-gay zealot Fred Phelps:</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The Victory Fund congratulates Tiffany Muller and the people of the Topeka on her achievement in last night's primary. The primary election results, combined with the approval of the anti- bias ordinance, send an important message that fairness and equality are values embraced by Topeka.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The results also reinforce what Muller and the Victory Fund have said from the beginning-this election is about more jobs, better schools and safer neighborhoods. This is the message Muller will now take onto the general election.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We strongly encourage all Victory Fund members and supporters to remember the primary win is only half of the battle-Muller now needs our full support to continue her work so she can remain on the Topeka City Council.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Tiffany Muller moves on to a two-way nonpartisan general election on April 5th.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>The Gay &amp; Lesbian Victory Fund is the nation's largest lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) political action committee and the only organization whose central mission is to increase the number of gay and lesbian public officials at all levels of government. In 2004, 41 of 65 Victory Fund endorsed LGBT candidates won their races, including five in states that also passed anti-gay amendments in 2004: Georgia, Michigan, Missouri, Oregon and Utah. Since its founding in 1991, the Victory Fund has invested over $15 million and secured more than a fivefold increase in the number of openly gay and lesbian officials serving in America to over 295 today. </i></font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
