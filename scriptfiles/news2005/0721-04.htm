<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - July 21  - ADA Watch/NCDR is opposed to the nomination of Judge John Roberts to a lifetime seat on the U.S. Supreme Court.  </font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At a time when our Nation could have greatly benefited from the selection of a mainstream consensus nominee, people with disabilities -- indeed all Americans -- should be saddened and disturbed by President Bush's choice of Judge John Roberts to fill Justice Sandra Day O'Connor's seat on the U.S. Supreme Court.   </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">While Justice O'Connor did not take the side of people with disabilities in all cases, she was the swing vote on important 5-4 rulings involving the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), including historic cases such as Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581 (1999) and Tennessee v. Lane, 541 U.S. 509 (2004).  </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">With the selection of John Roberts, President Bush is making good on his stated intention to fill a Court vacancy with a nominee in the mold of Scalia or Thomas -- Justices who have consistently ruled against people with disabilities in these and other landmark cases. If confirmed, such 5-4 votes would surely go in the other direction and reverse the historic gains of people with disabilities. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ADA Watch/NCDR is a coalition of hundreds of disability, civil rights and social justice organizations united to defend and promote the human rights of children and adults with physical, mental, cognitive and developmental disabilities.  </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Why we are opposed to Judge John Roberts:</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Narrow Interpretation of the ADA:</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">After the Sixth Circuit ruled that a woman with serious manual impairments was substantially limited in one or more of her life activities, the Supreme Court agreed to hear the case (Williams v. Toyota Motor Mfg., Ky., Inc., 224 F.3d 840 [2000]), and Judge Roberts argued and briefed the case on behalf of Toyota. His briefs and oral argument distorted the facts of the case and minimized the extent of Ella Williams' disability. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Unfortunately, the Supreme Court believed Judge Roberts&#146;s misrepresentations and decided in favor of Toyota. It also came down with a new and very strict test for disability. This test has made it much more difficult for ADA plaintiffs to prove that they are disabled with devastating impact on people with epilepsy, diabetes, mental illness and workplace injuries. </font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The impact of Robert's distortions is evident in subsequent decisions including Three Rivers Center for Independent Living v. Pittsburgh Public Housing Authority, which barred a Center for Independent Living (CIL) from filing suit to hold a Public Housing Authority accountable for violating Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act.</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Thus the consequences of Judge Roberts&#146;s distortions of the record have been wide-ranging: they helped to create yet another unfortunate Supreme Court precedent that has further impeded the goals of the ADA.</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Judicial Activism: </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Roberts&#146; record demonstrates his inclination to strike down federal anti-discrimination statues and to further limit congressional power, narrowly construe the ADA, and restrict the ability of plaintiffs to get into federal court. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Extremist Ideology: </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Roberts declared that the current Supreme Court is not conservative enough specifically in response to the October 1999 term during which the conservative majority judicial activism included the striking down of the Violence Against Women Act and throwing out an age discrimination suit on federalism grounds.  </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Mr. Roberts is a member of two right-wing legal groups that promote a pro-corporate, anti-regulatory agenda: the Federalist Society and the National Legal Center For The Public Interest, serving on the latter group's Legal Advisory Council.  </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Federalist Society&#146;s overarching goal is to roll back domestic policy to before FDR&#146;s New Deal and its members (including Jeffrey Sutton, William Pryor, and others) have specifically targeted the ADA. The National Legal Center For The Public Interest has attacked ADA civil rights protections in numerous forums including its publication of a document entitled &quot;Civil Rights and the Disabled: The Legislative Twilight Zone.&quot;    </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Narrowing of Civil Rights Protections: </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">After a Supreme Court decision effectively nullified certain sections of the Voting Rights Act (City of Mobile v. Bolden 446 U.S. 55 [1980]), Roberts was involved in the Reagan administration's effort to prevent Congress from overturning the Supreme Court's action. The Supreme Court had recently decided that certain sections of the Voting Rights Act could only be violated by intentional discrimination and not by laws that had a discriminatory effect, despite a lack of textual basis for this interpretation in the statute. Roberts was part of the effort to legitimize that decision and to stop Congress from overturning it. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In private practice, wrote a friend-of-the-court brief arguing that Congress had failed to justify a Department of Transportation affirmative action program. (Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Mineta, 2001). </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As expressed in one case where he would have invalidated a provision of the Endangered Species Act, his exceedingly restrictive view of federal law-making authority &#150; more restrictive than the current Supreme Court&#146;s &#150; could threaten a wide swath of workplace, civil rights, public safety and environmental protections.  In his years of service as a political appointee in the administrations of Presidents Reagan and George H.W. Bush, Judge Roberts also helped craft legal policies that sought to weaken school desegregation efforts, the reproductive rights of women, environmental protections, church-state separation and the voting rights of African Americans. <br></font></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p align="CENTER">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
