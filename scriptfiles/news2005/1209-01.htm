<p> WASHINGTON - December 9 - The Government Accountability Project (GAP) has created a drug “Fact Squad” to serve as an independent resource for journalists seeking straightforward information on drug safety. The “Fact Squad” is composed of a list of experts on prescription drugs, pharmaceutical companies, and the government agency that regulates them. The experts on our “Fact Squad” are individuals who work to serve the public interest.

 

<p>It has been shown that a growing number of Americans no longer trust the pharmaceutical industry. Simultaneously, there is a crisis of confidence in the Food & Drug Administration (FDA) as an impartial arbiter of drug safety and effectiveness. More than half of the agency's drug budget comes from industry user fees earmarked for speeding up the approval of drugs. As a result, it has been suggested that the FDA, long established as the "gold standard" of consumer protection against industry's dangerous drugs, now treats the industry as its primary client. 

 

<p>Our experts include:
