<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- January 19 -- At 9:00 a.m. on January 20, DAWN will hold a permitted anti-war rally at Malcolm X Park (also known as Meridian Hill), followed by a march down 16th Street ending at McPherson Square Park at approximately 12:30 p.m. Following the march, there will be a smaller stage in McPherson Square and march participants can head to the parade route or to other events. DAWN&#146;s non-violent civil disobedience action is separate and will leave Malcolm X Park half an hour later culminating in a &#145;die-in&#146; where people will lay down in the street to protest the violence at home and abroad perpetrated by Bush and his administration. </font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DAWN&#146;s counter-inaugural actions stand in support of a world that embraces social justice over economic imperialism, and seeks international peace through dialogue not senseless violence. DAWN believes in enhancing our civil rights and civil liberties rather than denigrating them, and in the right of all people -- not to an occupation called democracy -- but to true self-government. DAWN denounces Bush&#146;s War in Iraq, his illegal detentions at Guantanamo Bay, his environmental policies, his continued support of the Israeli government in its systematic violation of the rights of Palestinian people, and his support for illegal coups to overthrow democratically elected leaders &#150; particularly against Aristide in Haiti.</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Speakers at the rally include Democracy Now! host Amy Goodman; Aidan Delgado, a veteran of the Iraq war; Fr. Jean-Juste of Haiti, a former political prisoner, Stan Goff of Military Families Speak Out, and many more. The rally will also have live musical performances by Lucy Murphy and the DC Labor Chorus, folk singer David Rovics, hip hop artist MC Son of Nun, and others.  </font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The rally, march and die-in have been endorsed by one of the largest nationwide peace and justice organizations &#150; United for Peace and Justice &#150; which organized the February 15, 2003, and August 29, 2004 rallies in New York City, each drawing at least 500,000 participants.</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DAWN is an all volunteer network of individuals and organizations seeking to end U.S. military intervention abroad and attacks on our basic freedoms at home. DAWN meetings are open to the public and are conducted in an entirely democratic fashion.</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For more information on the rally, march and die-in or DAWN, please visit <a href="http://www.dawndc.net/" target="_new">http://www.dawndc.net</a>.
