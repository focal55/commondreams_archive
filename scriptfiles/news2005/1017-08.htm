<p>WASHINGTON - Revs. Jim Wallis, Convener of Sojourners and Call to Renewal and David Beckmann, president of Bread for the World will hold a telephone press conference highlighting the scandal of proposals in Congress that seek to cut funding to the food stamp program and alternative ways to balance the budget. 

<p>"Hunger and poverty are on the rise in our nation," said Beckmann. "Now is the wrong time to cut the nutritional safety net for poor people. There are alternative ways to balance our budget and we should take them."

<p>"A nation's budget reflects its priorities," said Wallis. "Now is the time to put those priorities in order - to draw a line in the sand against unjust policies and stand up for the common good."

<p>Every member of Congress received a letter on September 21 from a prominent group of Christian, Jewish and Muslim religious leaders asking representatives to protect the Food Stamp Program from funding cuts during the federal budget reconciliation process. The diverse group of signers includes His Eminence Theodore Cardinal McCarrick, Catholic Archbishop of Washington D.C.; Commissioner W. Todd Bassett, National Commander, The Salvation Army, United States; Rev. Mark S. Hanson, Presiding Bishop, Evangelical Lutheran Church in America and Rt. Rev. Philip R. Cousin, Sr., Senior Bishop, African Methodist Episcopal Church.
