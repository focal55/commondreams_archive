<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- February 8 -- U.S. Representatives Barbara Lee (D-CA) and Lynn Woolsey (D-CA) today were unanimously elected co-chairs of the Congressional Progressive Caucus. </font></p><p>        <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;During the last election cycle, tens of thousands of people got involved with politics for the first time because they were drawn to the basic principles of fairness and justice that the Progressive Caucus has long represented in Congress,&quot; said Caucus Co-Chair Lee.  &quot;We will continue our commitment to these principles, and I hope to build stronger connections with young people and communities of color and strengthen the role of the Progressive Caucus in giving voice to this emerging progressive majority.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The Progressive Caucus will continue to be at the forefront of issues that affect our country, our world and future generations,&quot; said Caucus Co-Chair Woolsey. &quot;The Bush Administration is taking us down a treacherous path in regards to our domestic budget priorities and international policies.  I look forward to working with Co-Chair Lee and the other members of the Progressive Caucus  in putting America back on track by protecting civil rights, promoting renewable energy sources, supporting U.S. troops by bringing them home from Iraq, and fighting the real war against terrorism by working towards international cooperation and peace rather than warmongering.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">        As the largest Caucus within the Democratic Caucus, the Progressive Caucus has had success in influencing both national policy and the Democratic Party.  It was the Progressive Caucus that led the anti-war effort that ended up with two-thirds of Democrats voting against the authorization of the use of force against Iraq.<br></font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
