<p>CRAWFORD, Texas - August 19 -  As Cindy Sheehan leaves Crawford to help care for her mother who entered the hospital yesterday, members of Gold Star Families for Peace and Military Families Speak Out -- those whose loved ones were killed in Iraq, and those who have loved ones are needlessly in harm's way -- vowed to remain in Crawford and to carry on the vigil at "Camp Casey" in Cindy Sheehan's absence.

<p>Families from across the country continue to come to Crawford to uphold the call for a meeting with President Bush, and an end to the war in Iraq.

<p>Mimi Evans of Hyannis, Mass., said, shortly after Cindy left the Vigil, "My son is deploying to Iraq within the next week, and I am here in Crawford because I have the same questions for the President as Cindy does. Just what is the noble cause for which my son is risking his life?"

<p>"Military and Gold Star Families will remain in Crawford throughout the month or until we meet with President Bush. We hope Cindy can return here, but if she is unable to, we are determined to continue to uphold the call for a meeting and an end to the war. The questions Cindy has for President Bush are the same questions thousands of mothers and families across the country have," said State Sen. Becky Lourey of Kerrick, Minn., whose son Chief Warrant Officer Matthew Scott Lourey was killed in Iraq on May 27, 2005.

<p>Members of Gold Star Families for Peace and Military Families Speak Out will speak at a press conference at 11:30 a.m today (Aug. 19) at Camp Casey in Crawford, Texas, featuring Mimi Evans, Becky Lourey, Michelle DeFord, Nadia McCaffrey and other Military and Gold Star Families.
