<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">NEW YORK, NY -- February 10 -- </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Today, The Drum Major Institute for Public Policy (DMI), the leading public policy group, launches a Fellows program that will challenge the traditional model for the development of social and economic policy. </font><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The organization&#146;s Fellows program will seek to insert New York City&#146;s grassroots leaders into the broader public policy debate. Calling on the lived experiences of progressives working on the ground of failed public policy to provide new thinking, DMI's first-rate Fellows program will take on the institutes of the right, with an innovative model they believe will more adequately address problems faced by communities and lead to better solutions for them. </font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;The time is ripe to take on extreme right wing groups like the Manhattan Institute whose views on public policy issue too often go unchallenged,&#148; said DMI Executive Director Andrea Batista-Schlesinger.  &#147;Our fellows are unique in that they are both activists and intellectuals who combine grassroots experience with intellectual rigor.  Unlike most public policy pundits when it comes to the issues they address, they will be able to speak from the experience of having been there.&#148;</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The fellows range from the founder of Brooklyn's first black-run credit union, to a pioneering advocate for environmental justice and sustainable development in the South Bronx, to the organizer of a grassroots student activist and leadership training organization at Hunter College in Manhattan. These Fellows not only span the physical city, but a range of pressing issues its residents care about. Combining their talent and experience with rigorous research support provided by DMI staff, communications training, and aggressive dissemination and placement of their work, DMI aims to change the face of discussion about public policy in this city.</font></p><p> </p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The fellows are:</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Majora Carter</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Environmental Justice</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Majora Carter is the founder and executive director of <a href="http://www.ssbx.org/" target="_new">Sustainable South Bronx</a>, a community organization dedicated to the implementation of sustainable development projects for the South Bronx that are informed by the needs of the community and the values of environmental justice.

The goal: progressive public policy for social and economic fairness. DMI&#146;s approach is unwavering: We do not issue reports to see our name in print or hold forums for the sake of mere talk. We seek to change policy by conducting research into overlooked, but important social and economic issues, by leveraging our strategic relationships to engage policymakers and opinion leaders in our work, and by offering platforms to amplify the ideas of those who are working for social and economic fairness.
