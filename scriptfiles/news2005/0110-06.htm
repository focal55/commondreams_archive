<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- January 10 -- The Gay &amp; Lesbian Leadership Institute, a nonpartisan educational organization, announced the launch of the Gay &amp; Lesbian Leadership SmartBrief. This groundbreaking free resource pools thousands of news articles, research and media reports covering community leaders into one summarized e-newsletter that links to original online news sources. The first issue was delivered to subscribers on Jan. 6.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We strive to give LGBT leaders the tools, resources and training they need to be successful not only in the public sector, but everywhere gays and lesbians have an opportunity to effect change and serve as role models,&quot; said Chuck Wolfe, president and CEO of the Gay &amp; Lesbian Victory Fund and Leadership Institute. &quot;The Gay &amp; Lesbian Leadership SmartBrief will give public, private and not-for-profit leaders news they can use to be effective -- whether for policy development, entrepreneurship, philanthropy or activism.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For eight years beginning in the mid-90s an activist duo known as &quot;FenceBerry&quot; searched the web for gay-related news stories, formatted the articles into simple emails and zapped them to over a thousand activists and journalists who relied on the service to stay current. The lesbian couple retired in 2004 and in September of that year sent out their last issue. The Gay &amp; Lesbian Leadership SmartBrief is launched in the spirit of these two women and will be offered to any subscriber free of charge.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>SmartBrief, Inc., the Leadership Institute's delivery partner for this service, combines proprietary technology with human intelligence, offering digestible knowledge to keep decision- makers abreast of their issue areas and industries. Sponsors of the Gay &amp; Lesbian Leadership SmartBrief, who will be featured in advertiser sections of the email newsletter, will underwrite the cost of the service.</i></font></p><p><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For more information, visit <a href="http://www.smartbrief.com/lgbt" target="_new">http://www.smartbrief.com/lgbt</a>.</font></i></p><p><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Founded in 1993, the Gay &amp; Lesbian Leadership Institute is the only national organization solely committed to the leadership and professional development of the nation's LGBT public, private and not-for-profit leaders.
