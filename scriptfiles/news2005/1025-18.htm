<p>WASHINGTON - Inadequate funding and staffing have left the Bureau of 
Land Management ill-equipped to manage its premier Western lands, putting 
nationally significant natural and cultural resources at risk. The agency&#8217;s 
management shortcomings are detailed in a first assessment of the BLM&#8217;s 26 
million-acre National Landscape Conservation System (NLCS), released today by 
the Wilderness Society and World Resources Institute.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>&#8220;Conservation is supposed to be the priority for these places, but, despite 
the presence of many talented and committed managers, BLM simply is not getting 
the job done,&#8221; said The Wilderness Society&#8217;s Wendy VanAsselt, one of the authors 
of the report, <I>State of the National Landscape Conservation System: A First 
Assessment</I>. &#8220;The System needs more funding, more staffing, and a true 
commitment from Interior Department leadership to long-term protection of these 
irreplaceable treasures.&#8221;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>The NLCS was established five years ago, under the leadership of Interior 
Secretary Bruce Babbitt, to conserve, protect, and restore the Bureau of Land 
Management&#8217;s most scenic and significant lands and waters. It includes National 
Monuments, National Conservation Areas, Wilderness, Wilderness Study Areas, 
Historic Trails, and Wild and Scenic Rivers. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>The report grades the BLM&#8217;s Conservation System in seven categories, based 
on a review of more than 35 indicators ranging from natural resource monitoring 
to accountability, and uses BLM data and information. The Conservation System 
scores no higher than a &#8220;C&#8221; in any category, although some individual places 
merited A&#8217;s and B&#8217;s for select issues of stewardship and management.&nbsp; The 
full report and background information is available at: <U><A 
href="http://www.wilderness.org/Library/Documents/StateOfTheNLCS2005.cfm">http://www.wilderness.org/Library/Documents/StateOfTheNLCS2005.cfm</A> 
</U></DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>&#8220;The National Landscape Conservation System was created to 
safeguard&nbsp;landscapes that are as spectacular&nbsp;in their own&nbsp;way as 
our National Parks,&#8221; said former Secretary of the Interior, Bruce Babbitt.&nbsp; 
&#8220;There is clear evidence, however, that we are at risk of moving backwards 
and&nbsp;failing to adequately protect these special American lands.&nbsp; The 
Department of&nbsp;the Interior and our leaders in Congress should take the 
recommendations of this report to heart and support the conservation mission of 
the NLCS before it is too late.&#8221;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>The report asserts that BLM managers are hobbled by inadequate budgets. 
Although the NLCS represents approximately 10 percent of the 261 million acres 
managed by the BLM, including a large number of the BLM&#8217;s most publicly visited 
lands and waters, it receives just 2.5 percent of the Agency&#8217;s $1.8 billion 
budget. A consequence of this under-funding is a glaring lack of field staff to 
address inappropriate off-road vehicle use, vandalism, and other problems. For 
the 15 places assessed, each ranger patrols an average of 200,000 acres.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>&#8220;Many of these National Monuments and Conservation areas already struggle 
with vandalism of archaeological sites, illegal off-road vehicle use, grazing 
damage, and the pressure of growing visitor use, as the lands around these 
protected areas become more developed,&#8221; said VanAsselt. &#8220;Unfortunately, almost 
every NLCS unit lacks adequate law enforcement staff, archaeological expertise, 
and scientists.&nbsp; The BLM also lacks the resources for comprehensive visitor 
management planning.&#8221;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Considered by many to be the &#8220;hidden treasures of the American West,&#8221; the 
lands and waters of the National Landscape Conservation System are experiencing 
rapidly increasing visitor numbers.&nbsp; For example, the number of visitors to 
the five BLM National Monuments in Arizona has doubled since 2000. &nbsp;Some of 
the fastest growing urban areas in the West border or surround NLCS lands, 
including Palm Springs, Tucson, Phoenix, and Las Vegas.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Many NLCS lands are threatened by excessive road networks that fragment 
wildlife habitat and bring motorized vehicles perilously close to cultural 
resources, such as archeological sites that, in most cases, have not yet been 
studied by the BLM. On average, 50 percent of the land in NLCS monuments and 
conservation areas is within one-half mile of a road or travel route, and 90 
percent is within two miles of a road or route.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>The assessment also uncovered an urgent need for better monitoring by the 
BLM of the most special aspects of the Conservation System, such as threatened 
species, water quality, and cultural sites. For example, the agency has only 
comprehensively inventoried cultural and historic resources in an estimated 6-7 
percent of the total area encompassed by the National Monuments and Conservation 
Areas, and monitoring programs are equally deficient. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>&#8220;The BLM should view this report card as a wake-up call,&#8221; said Dr. David 
Jhirad, Vice-President of Science and Research for World Resources 
Institute.&nbsp; "The BLM must set clear conservation goals, and implement 
effective systems to hold themselves accountable for achieving those goals. The 
BLM needs to empower the staff of the NLCS, provide them with significantly more 
resources, and issue annual reports on its own performance."&nbsp; </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>The assessment includes recommendations to help BLM better protect the 
cultural and natural resources of the National Landscape Conservation 
System.&nbsp; Among them:</DIV>
<UL type=disc>
  <LI>Increased staffing and financial resources dedicated to the Conservation 
  System by BLM. 
  <LI>A better information base for conservation management, including more, or 
  better-organized, data collection. 
  <LI>Completion of overdue management plans and implementation strategies. 
  <LI>Immediate closure of harmful roads and routes. 
  <LI>Full utilization of volunteers and academic partnerships to inventory, 
  monitor, and protect resources. 
  <LI>Increased accountability, including the establishment of clear 
  conservation goals specific to the National Landscape Conservation System, and 
  a commitment from the agency to publicly track progress toward those goals. 
  </LI></UL>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>&#8220;This report is important because it begins to create a system by which the 
BLM and the country can tell how well the National Landscape Conservation System 
is able to fulfill its mission,&#8221; said Dr. Anthony C. Janetos, Vice President at 
the H. John Heinz III Center for Science, Economics, and the Environment</DIV>

<DIV><B>The National Landscape Conservation System at a Glance</B></DIV>
<DIV><U></U>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Many National Landscape Conservation System units were created to protect 
contiguous landscapes that preserve the ecological or cultural integrity of some 
of the West&#8217;s most precious lands. For example, Arizona&#8217;s Agua Fria National 
Monument contains hundreds of archaeological structures and sites that were 
interrelated in a large community. To truly understand these ancient communities 
in context and tell their story, it is essential to look at the entire system of 
archaeological sites. Another example is the Grand Canyon-Parashant National 
Monument, a truly landscape-scale unit that encompasses large parts of the 
watershed of the Grand Canyon adjacent to the park. </DIV>
