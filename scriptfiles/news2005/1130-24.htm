<p>WASHINGTON - November 30 - Congressman Dennis J. Kucinich (D-OH) issued the following statement today following the President's speech latest "major" address on Iraq:

<p>"What we heard today from the President is not a plan. It is simply more of the same failed logic, failed policy and failed rhetoric that misled this nation into war, and keeps us there. 

<p>"The President's claim to a have a "victory strategy" is about as accurate and truthful as his claims that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction.

<p>"Today's speech by the President was nothing more than political rhetoric meant to halt his free falling poll numbers. Our troops and their family and loved ones at home deserve more than politics as usual from the President. They deserve a real and concrete plan to bring our troops home. Today the President failed to provide such a plan. 

<p>"The President must be honest with the American people. Things are going badly in Iraq, and our presence as an occupying force is counterproductive. 

<p>"Instead of campaign style speeches, the President's time would be better spent, doing what a majority of the American people want him to do, planning to bring our troops home and ending the war in Iraq."
