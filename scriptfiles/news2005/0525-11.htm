<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">YARMOUTH PORT, MA -- May 25 --  The International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW) is urging Iceland to end whaling as the government considers recommendations for its highest quota since resuming the hunt.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The British, French and German governments also issued a message which strongly criticised the Marine Research Institute's proposals for 39 minke whales to be taken this year.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">IFAW condemned the recommendation as cruel, unnecessary and economically unsustainable and called on Iceland's Ministry of Fisheries to abandon the practice. It is also concerned by proposals to take a further 100 whales next year.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Iceland resumed whaling two years ago on the grounds of scientific research.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">IFAW marine campaigner Ellie Dickson said: &quot;We strongly oppose the recommendation made by the Marine Research Institute and call on the Icelandic Government not to go whaling this year or in future years. The Ministry claims its research will help establish if whales are damaging fish stocks, but marine eco-systems are more complex than that and there is no evidence that culling whales will affect the number of fish. There is also no market for the meat.&quot;</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A joint statement from the British, French and German governments emphasised their &quot;strong opposition&quot; and called on Iceland to abandon the whaling programme, which it describes as being of &quot;questionable scientific value&quot;.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Since August 2003, 62 minke whales have been killed in Iceland's coastal waters.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Whale meat was on sale in some Icelandic supermarkets and restaurants days after the first whale was caught, but poor demand for whale meat in Iceland has led to huge stocks remaining in freezers.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">IFAW encourages responsible whale watching around the world as an alternative to whaling and helped set up Iceland's successful whale watch industry. This attracted around 82,000 tourists last year -- boosting the economy by an estimated &pound;9.5m. But tour operators are concerned that whaling has been taking place in whale watch areas, despite assurances that this would not happen.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For further information and pictures please contact: Clare Sterling, IFAW, 020-7587-6708 or email: <a href="mailto:csterling@ifaw.org" target="_new">csterling@ifaw.org</a> Alternatively visit <a href="http://www.ifaw.org/" target="_new">http://www.ifaw.org</a></font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
