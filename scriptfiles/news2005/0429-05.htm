As a primary partner, the U.S. Forest Service will match each tree planted by Coleman, its retailers and customers for a total of 20 million trees. Trees will be planted in every state throughout the country. In addition, education and training programs to protect 100 million acres of working farms and ranches also will be undertaken.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Mel Coleman, Jr., Chairman, Coleman Natural Foods, whose vision inspired the initiative is challenging America to join him and the Coleman partners, the U.S. Forest Service, American Forests and American Farmland Trust by contributing to the &quot;Mel Coleman, Jr., 20 Million Tree Challenge,&quot; a key component of the Coleman Eco-Project 2015.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Joining Coleman executives in Washington, D.C., at the Whitten Building on the Washington Mall in the ceremonial planting of the first of 20 million trees today: Mike Johanns, Secretary, United States Department of Agriculture; Sally Collins, Deputy Chief, USDA United States Forest Service; Dana York, Associate Chief, USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service; Andrew Johnson, Nez Perce Tribal Executive Committee Chairman; Debra Gangloff, Executive Director, American Forests; and Douglas P.

The Coleman family and company have always been dedicated to preserving the environment. We sincerely hope others throughout the country will join us to reach our 20 million tree planting goal,&quot; Coleman added.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This year natural/organic and conventional grocery retailers Wild Oats Markets, Dorothy Lane Markets, Knowlan&#146;s, the Mid-Atlantic and North Atlantic regions of Whole Foods Markets and select A&amp;P stores will display a tear pad with a UPC code that will permit customers to make a one-dollar contribution at each store checkout to the Coleman Eco-Project 2015. A tree will be planted for each dollar contribution made to the challenge and matched by the U.S. Forest Service. A Coleman product purchase is not required and Coleman contributions to the project are not contingent on sales. Other retailers from coast-to-coast are also planning to participate in the program.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The U.S. Forest Service will plant the trees with the resources provided by American Forests.
