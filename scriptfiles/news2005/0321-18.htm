<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">MINNEAPOLIS -- March 21 --  United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan today prioritized 31 international treaties critical to responding to global challenges as part of an overarching report on UN reform. The U.S. government has ratified only a small fraction of the treaties and has actually taken steps to reverse its involvement in several, according to an analysis by the Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy (IATP).</font><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The United States has ratified only eight of 31 treaties prioritized by Annan. Treaties the U.S. has not ratified include: Prevention of Trafficking Women and Children, the Protocol Against Torture, the Law of the Sea, the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, and the Convention Against Organized Crime. In the last five years the U.S. has backed out of a number of commitments by ending its involvement in several treaties it had previously supported including: the Kyoto Protocol on Climate Change, the International Criminal Court, and the Prohibition of Landmines. </font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Additionally, the Bush administration has taken steps to undermine the global treaty system by withdrawing from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty in 2002 and, just this month, withdrawing from a protocol part of the Vienna Convention of the Law of Treaties. </font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;We are falling behind as a global leader by not participating in a system of international law that protects children, refugees, and the environment,&#148; said Patricia Jurewicz, Director of IATP&#146;s Global Cooperation Project. &#147;In a sense, Annan&#146;s report is a challenge to the U.S. to join with other countries to make the world a better and safer place through rules that we can all live by. By participating in global treaties, we are demonstrating to the world that we are in this together and want to solve the world&#146;s problems together.&#148; </font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">While emphasizing the need for implementation and enforcement of the &#147;rule of law&#148; based on six decades of UN treaty-making, Annan also proposed a number of reforms for the UN itself. Among then, Annan suggests creating a small elected Human Rights Council to &#147;take the cause of human rights as seriously as those of security and development&#148; and give &#147;primacy&#148; to human rights as mandated by the UN Charter. Annan would also upgrade the Economic and Social Council to &#147;build bridges&#148; with the trade and financial institutions, &#147;provide direction&#148; in this decentralized area of work and &#147;assert leadership in driving a global development agenda.&#148;</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">IATP&#146;s recent report, The Treaty Database: U.S. Compliance with Global Treaties, documents U.S. history of joining or ignoring multilateral treaties, and includes a summary of the government's treaty actions broken down by presidential administration dating back to 1893.</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Treaty Database and the U.S. government&#146;s record of the 31 treaties prioritized by Annan can be viewed at: iatp.org.</font></p><p> </p><p><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy works globally to promote resilient family farms, communities and ecosystems through research and education, science and technology, and advocacy.</font></i></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
