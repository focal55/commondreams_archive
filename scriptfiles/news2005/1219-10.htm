<p>WASHINGTON - December 19 - Noting that the corrosive practice of racial profiling 
has continued despite President Bush&#8217;s promise in 2001 to "end it in America," 
the American Civil Liberties Union welcomed the reintroduction of the "End 
Racial Profiling Act" (ERPA) in the Senate late Friday and urged congressional 
leaders to co-sponsor this important bill and place its enactment at the top of 
their 2006 legislative agenda.</P>
<P>"Despite widespread condemnation of racial profiling by leaders from across 
the political spectrum, including the President, previous attempts to pass a 
comprehensive federal ban have not moved forward," said Caroline Fredrickson, 
Director of the ACLU Washington Legislative Office. "It&#8217;s time for our leaders 
to back up their professed indignation with concrete steps to end this offensive 
and ineffective law enforcement practice. Singling out people for police 
scrutiny based on their race, ethnicity, national origin or religion does 
nothing to make us safer, but does a great deal to deepen racial rifts in 
America."</P>
<P>An April 2005 Department of Justice survey found that blacks and Hispanics 
are roughly three times as likely as whites to be searched, arrested, or 
threatened or subdued with force when stopped by police. A September 2005 report 
by Amnesty International indicates that one in nine Americans has been 
victimized by racial profiling- a total of 32 million people nationwide. 
Nonetheless, 27 states have enacted no law to ban or curb racial profiling.</P>
<P>ERPA was introduced in the House and Senate in 2001 and 2004 and both times 
languished in committee without ever receiving an up-or-down vote. If enacted, 
ERPA would prohibit any local, state, or federal law enforcement agency or 
officer from engaging in racial profiling. It would make efforts to eliminate 
the practice a condition of law enforcement agencies receiving federal money. 
ERPA would institute a meaningful enforcement mechanism to ensure that 
anti-profiling policies are being followed. Law enforcement agencies would be 
required to collect demographic data on routine investigatory activities, 
develop procedures to respond to racial profiling complaints and craft policies 
to discipline officers who engage in the practice. ERPA also would provide 
victims of racial profiling with the legal tools to hold law enforcement 
agencies accountable.</P>
<P>"Racial profiling has undermined the respect and trust between law 
enforcement and communities of color, which is essential to successful police 
work," said ACLU Legislative Counsel Jesselyn McCurdy. "It sends the message 
that some citizens do not deserve equal protection under the law. Without a 
comprehensive federal law that includes a strong enforcement and oversight 
mechanism, our national dialogue on racial profiling will remain just that -- a 
lot of talk." </P>
