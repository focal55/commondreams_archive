<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- February 17 -- The Environmental Protection Agency is illegally negotiating secret agreements with industry lobbyists over pesticide regulation, according to a lawsuit filed today by NRDC (Natural Resources Defense Council). The lawsuit specifically cites private agreements between the agency and chemical companies over the regulation of atrazine, one of the most heavily used weed-killers in the country, and DDVP, a highly toxic insecticide. NRDC contends the agreements have undermined public health safeguards by failing to restrict the use of these dangerous chemicals.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The EPA's secret, backroom deals with pesticide makers are clearly against the law, and they're a threat to our health,&quot; said NRDC attorney Aaron Colangelo. &quot;EPA is required to make independent decisions on pesticide safety, instead of negotiating deals with the chemical industry.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to government records obtained by NRDC through a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit, EPA officials met secretly more than 40 times with representatives from atrazine's main manufacturer, Syngenta, while the agency was evaluating the weed-killer's toxicity. Ultimately the agency agreed to allow atrazine to stay on the market even though the chemical has contaminated drinking water sources across the country. (See EPA Won't Restrict Toxic Herbicide Atrazine, Despite Health Threat.) The EPA also has been involved in private negotiations with the chemical company Amvac over the status of the insecticide DDVP (dichlorvos), which it sells under a number of trade names, including &quot;No-Pest Strips.&quot; These negotiations violate EPA's regulations and federal law, specifically the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act, the Federal Advisory Committee Act and the Freedom of Information Act, according to NRDC's lawsuit.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;These deals are bad for public health, bad for the environment, and bad for democracy,&quot; said Erik D. Olson, an NRDC senior attorney. Olson noted that more than 20 years ago NRDC sued the agency for similar widespread violations committed under EPA Administrator Ann Gorsuch. After Gorsuch and other EPA officials resigned amid allegations of improper industry influence, William Ruckelshaus replaced Gorsuch and settled NRDC's case in 1984, agreeing to strict regulations that forbid secret meetings and private deal-making. &quot;EPA apparently is back to its old bad habits,&quot; Olson said.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The regulations prompted by NRDC's 1983 lawsuit require open and transparent decision-making when the EPA is registering high risk pesticides or has placed them in &quot;special review,&quot; which calls for a prompt evaluation of their safety. These regulations forbid EPA from making a final decision based on negotiations with industry, and require the agency to make such decisions independently. In addition, if the agency establishes a group of outside advisors, the Federal Advisory Committee Act requires it to create a balanced advisory committee that meets in the open and is not &quot;inappropriately influenced&quot; by &quot;any special interest.&quot; Today's suit charges that EPA has ignored these requirements in its atrazine and DDVP negotiations.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Atrazine is used on most of the corn and sugarcane grown in the United States and has been detected in the drinking water of more than a million Americans at levels higher than EPA's safety standard. Scientific studies have found that atrazine can damage the reproductive system and cause higher rates of cancer.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The European Union recently banned atrazine because of pervasive drinking water contamination. Instead of restricting or banning atrazine in the United States, however, the EPA recently negotiated an agreement that only requires Syngenta to monitor streams and drinking water supplies for contamination. Under this deal, Syngenta will test fewer than 4 percent of the streams identified by the EPA as being at highest risk for atrazine contamination.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DDVP is one of a class of chemicals called organophosphates, which are neurotoxins that were originally developed as chemical weapons during World War II. DDVP causes permanent nervous system damage in young test animals, and may cause related abnormalities in exposed infants and children. Exposure to DDVP also can cause uncontrollable sweating, nausea, dizziness, muscle tremors and even death. Despite the risks, EPA is privately negotiating with DDVP's manufacturer Amvac to allow the company to continue to sell this nerve poison for many home and agricultural uses.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The lawsuit was filed today in federal court in Washington, D.C. NRDC is represented in the case by Colangelo, Olson, and the public interest law firm Meyer &amp; Glitzenstein.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The following documents show some of the negotiations between the EPA and industry lobbyists. These are just a small sample of the hundreds of documents NRDC has obtained that provide evidence of these illegal negotiations.</font></p><ul><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">    Report of a joint EPA and Syngenta work group that negotiated the &quot;safe&quot; level of environmental contamination of atrazine.<br></font></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">     Report of a second EPA and Syngenta work group that negotiated an atrazine water monitoring plan that ignores more than 96% of the &quot;most potentially vulnerable watersheds.&quot;<br></font></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">    Example of a private meeting between EPA and Syngenta (July 10, 2003) to negotiate a monitoring plan in lieu of regulation.<br></font></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">     Email presenting a proposed deal between EPA and Syngenta on watershed monitoring.<br></font></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">     Negotiations between EPA and Syngenta regarding atrazine regulation (unlawfully withheld from the public docket for more than 18 months).</font></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">    Final negotiated agreement between EPA and Syngenta, Dow, and other chemical manufacturers regarding the regulation of atrazine.<br></font></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">     Negotiations between EPA and Amvac to jointly &quot;craft the terms and conditions&quot; of DDVP risk mitigation.<br></font></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">     EPA staff email regarding ongoing negotiations with Amvac.<br></font></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">    EPA staff email regarding negotiations with Amvac over potentially risky &quot;pest strip&quot; uses of DDVP.<br></font></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">     EPA staff email discussing &quot;verbal agreement&quot; with Amvac regarding which uses of DDVP will be allowed.<br></font></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Small sample of EPA calendar entries noting frequent meetings with Amvac regarding DDVP risk management.<br></font></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> EPA memo noting four additional meetings with Amvac regarding DDVP risk mitigation.<br></font></li></ul><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">      <i>The Natural Resources Defense Council is a national, nonprofit organization of scientists, lawyers and environmental specialists dedicated to protecting public health and the environment.
