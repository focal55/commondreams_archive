<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- January 13 -- NARAL Pro-Choice America, the nation&#146;s leading advocate of personal privacy and a woman&#146;s right to choose, released the 14th annual edition of its publication Who Decides? The Status of Women&#146;s Reproductive Rights in the United States.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">With President Bush poised to name activists to fill likely vacancies on the U.S. Supreme Court, the report&#146;s findings indicate that, if Roe v. Wade were overturned, 19 states would quickly outlaw abortion, while another 19 could follow closely behind. In 2004 alone, state legislatures considered 714 anti-choice measures&#151;an increase of 28 percent over the previous year&#146;s figure.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;State legislators are continuing to chip away at women&#146;s freedom&#151;and they are prepared to go much further if George Bush succeeds in his goal of overturning Roe v. Wade,&#148; said NARAL Pro-Choice America President Nancy Keenan. &#147;Americans oppose this push from the President and state legislatures to take over women&#146;s private medical decisions and restrict access to birth control, including the morning-after pill. That&#146;s why Americans are going to stand up to these threats to women&#146;s reproductive health services from the White House and state legislatures.&#148;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The report grades each state and the District of Columbia on women&#146;s reproductive rights and summarizes related state laws. It includes new sections citing key findings and political trends, including the following items:</font></p><ul><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">    Michigan enacted a near-total ban on abortions even in the early stages, the most far-reaching restriction on the right to choose by a state in more than 10 years. It is set to take effect in March and is certain to face a legal challenge that could well end up in the Supreme Court.<br></font></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">     A bill banning abortions throughout pregnancy failed by one vote in the South Dakota Senate. As a result of the recent elections, the bill is expected to pass this year.</font></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There are only four states where both the majority of the legislature and the governor are pro-choice: Connecticut, Maine, New Jersey and Washington.</font></li></ul><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The report is made available through NARAL Pro-Choice America. The report and additional up-to-the minute information can be found at <a href="http://www.prochoiceamerica.org/whodecides" target="_new">www.prochoiceamerica.org/whodecides</a>.</font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
