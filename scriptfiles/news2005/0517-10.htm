Politically-motivated killings of members of the press, activists, labor leaders, striking workers, and the harassment of anyone critical of the government have become routine in the Philippines.  All in the name of the United States&#146; global war against terror.  To call attention to these repressive conditions and the role of the US in creating such conditions, GABRIELA Network (GABNet), a US-Philippine women&#146;s solidarity organization, will hold a nationwide vigil on Friday, May 20, 2005.  There will be actions in Chicago, Los Angeles, New York, Portland, San Francisco, and Seattle.<br> <br>Philippine President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, an obstinate supporter of the US war on terror, has failed to investigate the killing of 13 journalists in 2004, the assassination of 11 GABRIELA and GABRIELA Women&#146;s Party members and affiliates, the murder and abduction of 300 activists and community leaders, and the hundreds of cases of human rights violations that have occurred during her term.  However, with or without government-sponsored inquiry, conclusive reports and accounts from witnesses point to the US-backed Philippine military and para-military groups as the perpetrators.<br> <br>For interviews, please call (212) 592-3507 or email <a href="mailto:gabnet@gabnet.org" target="_new">gabnet@gabnet.org</a>.</font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
