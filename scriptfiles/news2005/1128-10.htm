<p>WASHINGTON - November 28 - Today, East Timorese President Xanana 
Gusmão transmits to Parliament the final report of East Timor's Commission 
for Reception, Truth and Reconciliation (CAVR) on human rights violations 
committed in East Timor between 1974 and 1999, and the National Security 
Archive is making available to the public some of the more than 1,000 
formerly classified U.S. documents that it provided to assist the work of 
the CAVR.

<p>According to the CAVR, the timing of the release to the public of either 
the 2,500 page report or its executive summary will now be determined by 
East Timor's Parliament. The National Security Archive's Indonesia and East 
Timor Documentation Project is releasing these U.S. documents in the hopes 
of encouraging the speediest possible release and widest possible 
dissemination of the CAVR's findings, which are strongly critical of the 
role of the international community in supporting Indonesia's invasion and 
occupation of East Timor. Today is also the 30th anniversary of East 
Timor's (Timor-Leste) November 28, 1975 declaration of independence.

<p>"We expect the final report of the CAVR to demonstrate, as these documents 
do, that Indonesia's invasion and occupation of East Timor and the 
resulting crimes against humanity occurred in an international context in 
which the support of powerful nations, especially the United States, was 
indispensable," said Brad Simpson, assistant professor of history at 
University of Maryland, Baltimore County and Director of the National 
Security Archive's Indonesia and East Timor Documentation Project. "These 
documents also point to the need for genuine international accountability 
for East Timor's suffering, especially as Indonesia embarks on its own 
truth commission process."

<p>The documents included in this briefing book were declassified in response 
to Freedom of Information Act requests filed by the Archive's Indonesia and 
East Timor Documentation Project, after the Bush Administration refused a 
CAVR request for U.S. documents. The project aims to assist efforts to 
document and seek accountability for more than three decades of human 
rights abuses committed during the rule of Indonesian President Suharto 
(1965-1998).

<p>Among the revelations in these formerly secret documents:

<p>* U.S. officials adopted a "policy of silence" and sought to suppress news 
and discussion of East Timor, though they knew of Indonesian plans to 
invade nearly a year in advance;

<p>* The Ford Administration knew that Indonesia had invaded East Timor almost 
entirely using U.S. equipment, knew the use of this equipment was illegal, 
and discussed circumventing any possible Congressional ban on military aid 
to Indonesia;

<p>* In 1977, Carter Administration officials blocked declassification of the 
explosive cable transcribing President Ford and Secretary of State 
Kissinger's December 6, 1975 meeting with Indonesian President Suharto in 
which they explicitly approved of Indonesia's invasion of East Timor;

<p>* Through the 1980s, U.S. officials continued to receive - and deny or 
dismiss - credible reports of Indonesian massacres of Timorese civilians;

<p>* In 1993, the U.S. Ambassador in Jakarta concluded that the Suharto 
regime's effort to integrate East Timor into Indonesia had failed, and that 
"the repressive and pervasive Indonesian military presence is the main 
obstacle to the government's goal of integration.";

<p>* In September 1999 the CIA reported on Indonesian military and militia 
violence following East Timor's vote for independence as a form of 
terrorism, reporting that "the military has supported or worked alongside 
the militias."
