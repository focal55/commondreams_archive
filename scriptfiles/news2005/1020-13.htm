<p>WASHINGTON - October 20 - A hearing today in the Senate Judiciary Constitution subcommittee focused on the failed proposal to write discrimination against same-sex couples and their families into the Constitution.

<p>“They’re playing cynical political games that threaten the security of American families,” said Joe Solmonese, president of the Human Rights Campaign. “While some senators are trying to appease their extremist base, millions of Americans who support equal rights and responsibilities for all families will see through these hearings. Not only would the amendment ban marriage for same-sex couples, but it would threaten domestic partnerships and civil unions. It’s time for Washington to get back to helping all families, not hurting them.” 

<p>Sen. Sam Brownback, R-Kan., called for the hearing on the so-called “Marriage Protection Amendment.” Despite intense pressure from the White House and extreme right-wing organizations, the amendment, which requires two-thirds approval in each chamber, failed last year in the House by a 227-186 margin and in the Senate with a vote of 48-50.

<p><i>The Human Rights Campaign is the largest national lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender political organization with members throughout the country. It effectively lobbies Congress, provides campaign support and educates the public to ensure that LGBT Americans can be open, honest and safe at home, at work and in the community.
