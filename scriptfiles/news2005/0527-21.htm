<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - May 27 - Velvet Revolution --  <a href="http://www.velvetrevolution.us" target="_new">http://www.velvetrevolution.us</a> -- has joined a broad coalition of  veterans, peace, and political activist groups to announce a  campaign today to urge that the U.S. Congress launch a formal  investigation into whether President Bush has committed  impeachable offenses in connection with the Iraq war.  </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">   The campaign focuses on evidence that recently emerged in an  official British memo containing minutes of a secret July 2002  meeting between British Prime Minister Tony Blair and his top  national security advisors.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">   John Bonifaz, a Boston attorney specializing in constitutional  litigation, today sent a memo to Congressman John Conyers of  Michigan, the Ranking Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee,  urging him to introduce a Resolution of Inquiry directing the  House Judiciary Committee to launch a formal investigation into  whether sufficient grounds exist for the House to impeach  President Bush.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">   Bonifaz's memo, made available today at  <a href="http://www.AfterDowningStreet.org" target="_new">http://www.AfterDowningStreet.org,</a> begins: &quot;The recent release of  the Downing Street Memo provides new and compelling evidence that  the President of the United States has been actively engaged in a  conspiracy to deceive and mislead the United States Congress and  the American people about the basis for going to war against  Iraq.  If true, such conduct constitutes a High Crime under  Article II, Section 4 of the United States Constitution.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">   The now-infamous &quot;Downing Street Memo,&quot; written in July of  2002 -- a full eight months prior to launching the War on Iraq --  states that &quot;Bush wanted to remove Saddam, through military  action, justified by the conjunction of terrorism and WMD. But  the intelligence and facts were being fixed around the policy.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">   Eighty-nine members of the U.S. Congress recently sent a  letter to the Bush Administration requesting an explanation.  However, they have received no reply. In the meantime, neither  the Bush nor Blair Administrations have disputed the authenticity  of the memo.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">   It is time for an official Congressional inquiry into the  matter!</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">   In addition to Velvet Revolution, the original organizations  forming the AfterDowningStreet.org coalition include: Global  Exchange, Gold Star Families for Peace, Democrats.com, Veterans  for Peace, Code Pink, Progressive Democrats of America, Democracy  Rising, The BRAD BLOG and Justice Through Music.  These  organizations, beginning today, will be urging their members and  millions of other Americans to contact their Representatives to  urge support of the Resolution of Inquiry. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">   For more information on the coalition, see  <a href="http://www.AfterDowningStreet.org" target="_new">http://www.AfterDowningStreet.org,</a> or contact David Swanson, 202- 329-7847 (contact Swanson to set up an interview with Bonifaz.)</font></p>
