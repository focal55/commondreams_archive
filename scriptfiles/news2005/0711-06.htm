If true, they indicate that the President's top political advisor played a central role in the outing of a covert CIA agent.  According to the Washington Post account, Mr. Rove's attorney insists that Mr. Rove did not identify Ms. Plame &quot;by name.&quot;  But Mr. Rove did identify her as the spouse of former Ambassador Joseph Wilson IV, which would seem to be a distinction without a difference.  </font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">            The new disclosures also raise issues about whether Mr. Rove acted alone or whether there was a conspiracy with other White House staff to use classified information for the political purpose of discrediting Ambassador Wilson.  </font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">            I first wrote to you to request a hearing about this matter on September 29, 2003, and I renewed my request in a second letter on December 11, 2003.  During this period, we met with Ambassador Wilson, but you turned down my request for a hearing because you wanted to see what the investigation of Special Prosecutor Patrick J. Fitzgerald would uncover.  </font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">            The recent disclosures about Mr. Rove's actions have such serious implications that we can no longer responsibly ignore them.  The intentional disclosure of a covert CIA agent's identity would be an act of treason.  If there were evidence of such a serious breach during the Clinton Administration, there is no doubt that our Committee would have immediately demanded that the Deputy Chief of Staff testify at a hearing.  This would have been the right course of action then, and it is the right course now.  For this reason, I am renewing my request that the Committee schedule an immediate hearing at which Mr. Rove is called to testify.  </font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">            A congressional hearing at which Mr. Rove testifies under oath remains the simplest and most effective means for Congress and the public to learn the truth about this disgraceful incident. </font></p><p>            </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">                                                                        Sincerely,</font></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">                                                                        Henry A.
