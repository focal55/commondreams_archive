<p> WASHINGTON - November 15  - Appearing at a recent media conference, <span class="media_outlet">NBC</span> president Bob Wright offered a novel rationale for the exclusion of liberal voices on cable news: Liberals don't watch TV.<br />
<br />
During an interview with conservative <span class="media_outlet">MSNBC</span> host Tucker Carlson, Wright responded to Carlson's question about offering a left-leaning channel by saying that progressives "don't listen to a lot of radio and they don't watch a lot of television" (Broadcasting &amp; Cable, 11/13/05).<br />

<br />
It is ironic that Wright would say this to Carlson; if there's one thing many viewers don't seem to want to watch, it is Tucker Carlson's <span class="media_outlet">MSNBC</span> show.  In its first weeks on the air, Carlson's show was averaging about 200,000 viewers (<span class="media_outlet">Washington Post</span>, 7/30/05).  Even with the addition of a tabloid-oriented show hosted by Rita Cosby, the channel's prime-time audience in August was about 325,000 viewers (<span class="media_outlet">New York Times</span>, 8/29/05).  So if ratings are really what matter, one could argue that <span class="media_outlet">MSNBC</span>'s strategy of veering right--with shows hosted by Carlson and former Republican congressmember Joe Scarborough--has clearly been a failure.<br />
<br />
But recent history suggests that <span class="media_outlet">MSNBC</span> makes programming decisions based more on politics than audience share.  That was why Phil <span class="media_outlet">Donahue</span>'s <span class="media_outlet">MSNBC</span> show was cancelled, even though it was the channel's highest-rated program at the time, averaging over 400,000 viewers when it was cancelled (<span class="media_outlet">New York Times</span>, 2/26/03).  <br />

<br />
Internal <span class="media_outlet">MSNBC</span> memos revealed that network management was worried that <span class="media_outlet">Donahue</span> would be a "difficult public face for <span class="media_outlet">NBC</span> in a time of war," because <span class="media_outlet">Donahue</span> "seems to delight in presenting guests who are anti-war, anti-Bush and skeptical of the administration's motives" (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.fair.org/index.php?page=1631" title="">FAIR Action Alert</a>, 3/7/03).<br />

<br />
The relative success of the <span class="media_outlet">Donahue</span> show would seem to disprove Wright's claim that liberals don't watch TV, or that viewers aren't interested in hearing left-of-center views.  It appears that it's <span class="media_outlet">NBC</span>'s corporate managers, and not viewers, who aren't interested in such perspectives.<br />
<br />
<span class="sub_headline">ACTION:</span> Contact <span class="media_outlet">NBC</span> chairman Bob Wright and let him know whether or not you watch TV, and if you would watch a cable show hosted by a progressive.<br />
