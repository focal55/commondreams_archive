<p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- March 21 -- Peace movement launches educational campaign on 40th anniversary of the first Vietnam War teach-in. Events in Washington, D.C., San Francisco, and Ann Arbor, Michigan.<br> <br>The peace movement was right during the Vietnam War. It&#146;s right now about Iraq. Democracy can&#146;t be won through the barrel of a gun.  For peace to have a chance, the U.S. must implement a swift exit strategy for bringing the troops home. <br> <br>On Thursday, March 24, the 40th anniversary of the first Vietnam War teach-in, Iraq War opponents will kick off a new educational campaign with teach-ins in Washington, DC, San Francisco, and Ann Arbor. These events will feature Iraq experts and activists, military family members and Iraq War veterans, and Vietnam War-era activists. <br> <br>At the teach-ins, panels of influential speakers will address the true costs of the Iraq War to the U.S., Iraq and the world and the need for the U.S. to remove its troops from Iraq to reduce the deadly violence.<br> <br> &#147;It&#146;s time for the peace movement to go into education mode to bring the Iraq War to an end,&#148; said Amy Quinn, peace movement links coordinator at the Institute for Policy Studies, which is organizing the Washington, D.C. teach-in. &#147;There are so many Americans who believe the Iraq War is a mistake but are worried about what might happen if the U.S. troops pull out. We need to engage in a dialogue with them.&#148;<br> <br> The first Vietnam War teach-in was held at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor campus, on March 24, 1965. The faculty and student organizers of the teach-in intended for it to be a one-day moratorium on &#147;teaching as usual,&#148; but, because of strong administration opposition, they began the teach-in in the evening and continued throughout the night. Some 3,000 students attended, despite bomb threats, and within the next two months, a wave of teach-ins swept through college campuses all over the U.S. The teach-ins helped bring about the mass movement that eventually brought the Vietnam War to an end.<br> <br>MARCH 24 TEACH-IN DETAILS<br> <br>Washington, DC<br>George Washington University&#146;s Media and Public Affairs Building<br>7:00 pm<br>Speakers: <br></font></p><ul><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Naomi Klein, award winning journalist and author of No Logo <br></font></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Anas Shallal, Iraqi Americans for Peaceful Alternatives <br></font></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Damu Smith, founder of Black Voices for Peace <br></font></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Celeste Zappala, whose son was killed in the Iraq <br></font></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Phyllis Bennis, Fellow of the Institute for Policy Studies <br> <br>San Francisco, California<br>Mission High School<br>7:00 pm<br>Speakers:</font></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Rahul Mahajan, Author of Full Spectrum Dominance: U.S. Power in Iraq and Beyond <br></font></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sean O'Neil, a US Veteran of the Iraq War <br></font></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Medea Benjamin, Co-Founder of Global Exchange and CODEPINK <br></font></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Fernando Suarez, father of fallen Iraq War soldier Jesus Suarez del Solar <br></font></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Cindy Sheehan, father of fallen Iraq War soldier Casey Sheehan <br> <br>Ann Arbor, Michigan<br>Angel Hall, University of Michigan campus<br>7:00 pm<br><a href="http://www.teachin2005.org/%20for%20details" target="_new">http://www.teachin2005.org/ for details</a>.</font></li></ul><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
