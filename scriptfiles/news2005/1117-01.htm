<p>WASHINGTON - November 17 - Why is the Committee for Justice <a href="http://www.committeeforjustice.org/contents/alito/alitoad.shtml">talking about People For the American Way</a>?  

 

<p>Because they’d rather not talk about how Sam Alito’s legal philosophy will undermine Americans’ rights if he gets a lifetime seat on the Supreme Court.  They’d rather not try to defend his painful efforts to distance himself from his own words and record.  They’d rather not explain why he defended the legality of strip-searching a ten-year old girl, or why he tried to make it harder for people who have been discriminated against to get their day in court.

 

<p>So they’re trying to change the subject.  That’s how the Bush administration and its henchmen respond to criticism – with attacks designed to distract, intimidate and mislead. The Committee for Justice has made a specialty out of these ugly attacks.

 

<p>People For the American Way is part of a large, diverse, and growing coalition that is working to protect an independent judiciary and a Supreme Court that upholds Americans’ rights and legal protections.  We are proud of our work to preserve freedom of speech and religious liberty, and in the words of the authors of our Constitution, to “secure the blessings of liberty” for all Americans. 

 

<p>But nobody at People For the American Way has been nominated to a powerful lifetime seat on the Supreme Court – Samuel Alito has.  It’s his record and legal philosophy Americans should be talking about. Because it’s Americans’ rights and freedoms that will be threatened if he is confirmed to the Supreme Court.
