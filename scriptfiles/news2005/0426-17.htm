<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- April 26  -- Florida Governor Jeb Bush this morning signed a law that significantly broadens the ability of citizens to use deadly force in public. Conversely, Arizona Governor Janet Napolitano late yesterday vetoed a bill that would have permitted people to carry loaded, hidden guns into bars.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Florida Law</b></font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Governor Bush made a huge mistake signing this law, which threatens to enable every rogue with an itchy trigger finger in Florida,&quot; said Sarah Brady, Chair of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence. &quot;Deciding whether to use deadly force in a public place is something that experienced law enforcement professionals know should never be taken lightly.&quot;</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Floridians have gotten a message from their state government that it's okay to use deadly force, including guns, in public,&quot; said Dana Quist, President of the South Florida chapter of the Million Mom March. &quot;What this is really all about is that the NRA is trying to spread fear, so gun corporations can sell guns.&quot;</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Police chiefs who opposed the new Florida law include Chief John F. Timoney of the City of Miami Police Department, (305) 579-6565; Chief William Berger of the Palm Bay Police Department, a former President of the International Association of Chiefs of Police, (321) 952-3458; St. Petersburg police Chief Chuck Harmon, (727) 893-7780 and Broward County Sheriff Ken Jenne, (954) 831- 8900.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Arizona Veto</b></font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Governor Napolitano did the logical thing - she let bar owners decide if they wanted state law to allow people to carry loaded, hidden guns into bars,&quot; said Sarah Brady. &quot;That's listening to the people who know best.&quot;</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Community groups were vehemently opposed to the guns in bars bill and are grateful that Governor Napolitano responded with a veto,&quot; said Hildy Saizow of Arizonans for Gun Safety. &quot;She understands what the Arizona legislature did not -- that alcohol and guns do not mix. The recent shooting death of ASU football player Brandon Falkner outside a Scottsdale nightclub is a tragic example of why guns and alcohol do not mix. We applaud the Governor's efforts to support public safety over bad policy supported only by a minority of extremists.&quot;</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The guns in bars bill was strongly opposed by the Arizona Restaurant and Hospitality Association, 602-307-9134; and the Arizona Association of Chiefs of Police, 602-261-8494.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As the nation's largest, non-partisan, grassroots organization leading the fight to prevent gun violence, the Brady Campaign, working with its dedicated network of Million Mom March Chapters, is devoted to creating an America free from gun violence, where all Americans are safe at home, at school, at work, and in our communities.</font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
