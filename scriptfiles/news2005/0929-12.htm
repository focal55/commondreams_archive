<p align="left">WASHINGTON - September 29 - <SPAN class=BEX>In a statement issued today, ADA president Congressman Jim McDermott noted that, with the end of the fiscal year and the passage of a Continuing Resolution necessary to keep the Federal Government operating, the time has come to "build for a positive future"... rather than "continue to pursue a destructive cut and spend agenda." </SPAN><BR>
<BR>
<SPAN class=BEX>ADA national director Amy Isaacs echoed those sentiments saying, "In the wake of Katrina and Rita - and, yes, September 11 - it is all too tempting to shake our heads and ponder the imponderable. Instead, we should be asking, 'What are we about to do to our nation's security and our own communities?'"</SPAN><BR>
<BR>
<SPAN class=BEX>"There are lessons to be learned from that dark day in 2001 and from the recent natural disasters but, sadly, a quick look at White House and Congressional Budget proposals reveals we have learned virtually nothing," she continued. </SPAN><BR>
<BR>
<SPAN class=BEX>ADA president McDermott added, "The impending budget extension is only a band-aid on a gaping wound...As we close the books on the 2005 fiscal year, the Republican leadership should take a deep breath and look at all of the options, not just the ones that fit their political agenda."</SPAN><BR>
<BR>
<SPAN 
class=BEX>Instead, a study authored by ADA national board member Ed Schwartz, president of the </SPAN><A href="http://iscv.org/"><SPAN class=BEX>Institute for the Study of Civic Values</SPAN></A><SPAN class=BEX> in Philadelphia, paints an appalling picture:</SPAN><BR>
<BR>
<SPAN class=BEX>* Potential cuts of almost </SPAN><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold"><SPAN class=BEX>$900 million</SPAN></SPAN><SPAN class=BEX> from programs designed to help our first responders protect homeland security</SPAN><BR>
<BR>
<SPAN class=BEX>* Potential cuts of more than </SPAN><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold"><SPAN class=BEX>$1 billion</SPAN></SPAN><SPAN class=BEX> from programs essential to rebuilding all our communities and providing assistance to those most in need and, most particularly, those hit hardest by Katrina and Rita. Included in these proposed cuts are almost </SPAN><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold"><SPAN class=BEX>$428 million</SPAN></SPAN><SPAN class=BEX> from the Community Development Block Grant program - even though it is the major Federal program available to communities throughout the United States to strengthen infrastructure in the low and moderate income neighborhoods that were most badly damaged by Katrina and Rita. Also included are potential cuts of almost </SPAN><SPAN 
style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold"><SPAN class=BEX>$500 million</SPAN></SPAN><SPAN 
class=BEX> for Flood Control on the Mississippi.</SPAN><BR>
<BR>
<SPAN 
class=BEX>Finally, said ADA director Isaacs, "there may be valid arguments that some of the problems we have faced in recent months couldn't have been foreseen but, as we enter, the winter season, we do know that homes will have to be heated and that low-income families will face particular hardship in the face of sky-rocketing fuel costs." The current response: Potentially almost </SPAN><SPAN 
style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold"><SPAN class=BEX>$200 million</SPAN></SPAN><SPAN 
class=BEX> in cuts to the Low Income Energy Assistance program. This is a disaster waiting to happen and one which Congress must take immediate steps to avert.</SPAN></p>
