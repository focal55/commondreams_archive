<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">NEW YORK, NY -- March 15 -- </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Center for Constitutional Rights (CCR) together with attorneys from the law firm of DLA Piper Rudnick filed a strong opposition to the Administration&#146;s efforts to block the case of Canadian rendition victim Maher Arar. The government had asked the Federal Court to dismiss the case, asserting that the reasons Mr. Arar was rendered to Syria constitute state secrets and pursuing legal recourse for him would compromise national security. Attorneys for Mr. Arar today contested the government&#146;s request arguing that discovery can proceed without compromising state secrets.</font><p align="LEFT"> </p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Maher Arar, a Syrian-born Canadian citizen was detained at J.F.K. Airport in September 2002 on his way home to his family in Canada.  He was held in solitary confinement and interrogated without the benefit of legal counsel. The Administration labeled him a member of Al Qaeda, and rendered him, not to Canada, his home and country of citizenship, but to Syrian intelligence authorities renowned for torture.  Mr. Arar spent ten months detained in Syria, where he was brutally interrogated and tortured, without charge.  After nearly a year of confinement, Syrian authorities released Mr. Arar, publicly stating that they had found no connection to any criminal or terrorist organization or activity.  Upon his return to Canada, Mr. Arar was never charged with any crime; nor has he been charged with any crime by the United States.  The Canadian Parliament has convened a Public Inquiry to investigate the details and reasoning behind Mr. Arar&#146;s rendition. The United States has categorically refused to cooperate with the Inquiry.</font></p><p align="LEFT"> </p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;What I went through in Syria was beyond human imagination, and it was as a result of the U.S. policy of extraordinary rendition. To allow the U.S. government to dismiss my lawsuit is to deny justice not only to myself but also to the American people who have prided themselves on promoting and protecting human rights around the world,&#148; stated Maher Arar.</font></p><p align="LEFT"> </p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;There can be little doubt that every official of the United States government knew that sending Mr. Arar to a country where he would be detained arbitrarily and was likely to be tortured violated the U.S. Constitution, federal statutes, and international law.  Yet the government now seeks to prevent any litigation of these claims, invoking the state secrets privilege, an evidentiary privilege designed to prevent the release of military secrets.  How can the government take the position that its practice of outsourcing for interrogation under torture is a state secret?&#148; said Barbara Olshansky, Deputy Director for Litigation with the Center for Constitutional Rights.</font></p><p align="LEFT"> </p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;This motion and this case are of critical importance because they ask the court to consider an issue that for generations would have seemed simultaneously unthinkable and obvious&#151;that facilitating or condoning torture is outside the bounds of acceptable governmental behavior,&#148; said CCR staff attorney Maria LaHood. </font></p><p align="LEFT"> </p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Attorneys working on the case include Robert Fink, Joshua Sohn, Zazy Lopez, and Sarah Sterken from Piper, Rudnick, and from the Center for Constitutional Rights, Barbara Olshansky and Maria LaHood, and cooperating attorneys David Cole and Paul Hoffman.</font></p><p align="LEFT"> </p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To see a copy of the papers filed, visit the CCR website:  <a href="http://www.ccr-ny.org/" target="_new">www.ccr-ny.org</a>. <br></font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
