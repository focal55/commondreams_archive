<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">KETCHIKAN, ALASKA, USA -- May 11 -- Ketchikan, Alaska - After a week-long trial and 17 hours of deliberation, a six-person jury returned a mixed verdict in the State of Alaska's prosecution of Greenpeace, Inc. and two individuals.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In July 2004, the ship Arctic Sunrise entered Alaskan waters without a state-certified oil spill contingency plan (&quot;C-Plan&quot;) and state-certified financial coverage for oil spills (&quot;COFR&quot;).  The Arctic Sunrise is managed and operated by a Dutch company, Stichting Marine Services.  Stichting Marine Services, which was responsible for filing such documents, corrected the error within 24 hours of being notified of the problem, and stepped forward to accept full legal responsibility for the late filing.  However, the State of Alaska brought criminal charges against Greenpeace, which was using the ship at the time, Captain Arne Sorensen and Greenpeace employee Willem Beekman.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Greenpeace and Captain Sorensen faced four charges each:  for the C-Plan violation on July 12 and July 14, and for the COFR violation on July on 12 and July 14.  Mr. Beekman faced two charges - for the C-Plan violation and the COFR violation on July 14. The case represented the first time anyone has been criminally prosecuted for such violations despite the fact that at least 22 vessels lacked similar documents in 2004.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Greenpeace was acquitted of both COFR charges but found guilty on both C-Plan counts.  Captain Sorensen was acquitted of the COFR charge on the 14th, but found guilty of the other charges.  Mr. Beekman was acquitted of all charges.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We commend the hard work of the jury in this complex case,&quot; said Tom Wetterer, general counsel of Greenpeace, Inc. &quot;However, the mixed verdict raises issues of inconsistency.  We feel that Greenpeace and Captain Sorensen should also have been acquitted of all charges.  There was simply no conduct in this case that rose to the level of criminal negligence.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The fact that Mr. Beekman was rightly acquitted on all counts should have been sufficient for a full acquittal of Greenpeace as well, since the prosecutor argued that Mr. Beekman was Greenpeace, Inc.'s agent.&quot;</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Attorneys for Greenpeace and Captain Sorensen asked Judge Kevin Miller for a judgment of acquittal based in part on the verdict's inconsistencies.  Judge Miller took the matter under advisement pending briefings. The State of Alaska has until May 18 to file written opposition to the motion for acquittal.<br></font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
