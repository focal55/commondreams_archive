James McCrery, R-La., is pulling on the people of Louisiana on Social Security. Treasury Secretary John Snow plans to visit Louisiana this week to bolster Rep. McCrery&#146;s support for President Bush&#146;s privatization plan that cuts guaranteed Social Security benefits.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Rep. McCrery is under fire for taking campaign contributions from banks and security firms that make him beholden to Wall Street interests pressing privatization. The Campaign for America&#146;s Future&#146;s ads will run all week.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;U.S. Rep. James McCrery is running a classic Washington snow job on the working people of Louisiana,&#148; said Campaign for America&#146;s Future Co-director Roger Hickey. &#147;Congressman McCrery and President Bush&#146;s privatization plan benefits Wall Street and cuts guaranteed benefits for people on Main Street.&#148;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Campaign for America&#146;s Future and Americans United to Protect Social Security &#150; a new coalition created by the Campaign for America&#146;s Future, AFSCME, AFL-CIO, USAction and more than 200 groups opposed to the president&#146;s privatization plan &#150; also announced today that they will keep the heat on Congress in the wake of the successful anti-privatization campaign waged by citizen groups at Congressional town hall meetings over the last week. Thousands of citizens opposed to privatization will call their representatives and senators this week as they return to Washington from recess.<br> <br>The Campaign for America&#146;s Future last week highlighted Rep. McCrery&#146;s ties to securities and commercial banking industries and questioned who stands to benefit most from the decisions Rep. McCrery will make as chair of the House Social Security Subcommittee.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Campaign for America&#146;s Future released an analysis of Rep. McCrery&#146;s record last week and kicked off a multimedia ad campaign in his backyard. The group ran its first ads in the Shreveport Times and Shreveport Sun. Secretary Snow and President Bush are coming to Rep. McCrery&#146;s aid. Rep. McCrery told the Associated Press that he advised President Bush to visit Louisiana early next month.</font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
