<p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- April 14 -- A new Congressional Research Service (CRS) report commissioned by Congressman Dennis J. Kucinich (D-OH), and released today, shows that the United States is investing hundreds of millions of dollars in the construction of &quot;long-term&quot; bases in Iraq. </font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The report, requested in December, and completed this week, states that since 9/11, the Department of Defense has received supplemental funding of over $1 billion for military construction in Iraq and Afghanistan. </font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Of the military construction funds, the report states, &quot;some projects&#133;suggest substantial U.S. investment to improve facilities that could be used for the longer-term.&quot;  These long-term projects in Iraq include, $214 million for the Balad Air Base and $49 million for the Taji Military Complex.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;This report clearly indicates that, despite recent press accounts, this Administration has no plans to leave Iraq any time soon, and raises questions about whether permanent bases are being built,&quot; stated Kucinich. &quot;The US military presence in Iraq is counterproductive, and the construction of 'long-term' bases in the country will only prolong the occupation and cause more US casualties. It is time for this Administration to be straight with the American people, and the Congress, and let them know their true intentions in Iraq.&quot;</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The report, issued by the non-partisan Congressional Research Service, is the first congressional report that has identified specific locations in Iraq where the U.S. is possibly constructing a permanent military presence. </font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>For a complete copy of the report please contact Doug Gordon at (202) 225-5871, copies are also available at <a href="http://www.house.gov/kucinich" target="_new">http://www.house.gov/kucinich</a>.</i> <br></font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
