<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">NEW YORK, NY -- March 30 -- United for Peace and Justice (UFPJ) condemns the Bush Administration's nomination of Paul Wolfowitz, architect of the Iraq War, to head the World Bank. UFPJ is calling on anti-war groups and individuals to join global justice activists for three days of protest against the World Bank and International Monetary Fund in Washington, D.C., from April 15-17.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;This nomination is an aggressive move by the Bush Administration to use international development policy, and the money of the World Bank, to impose its will on developing countries, just as it has used its military to impose its will on Iraq and Afghanistan,&quot; said UFPJ National Coordinator Leslie Cagan.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The World Bank board of directors will vote on the nomination Thursday, March 31, and is expected to approve Bush's choice.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Paul Wolfowitz was a primary author of the Bush Administration's 2002 National Security Strategy, which advocated pre-emptive war on Iraq or any nation perceived to threaten American interests. The strategy further called for U.S. economic and military domination in every corner of the world.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In opposing the Wolfowitz appointment, UFPJ calls for the transformation of the World Bank from an exploitative organization to one that is truly committed to ending poverty and promoting sustainable development - as an important step toward ending violence worldwide.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The U.S. has historically used its power over the World Bank to exploit the resources of the developing world, at enormous cost to the people of the Global South and the environment,&quot; said Orin Langelle of the Global Justice Ecology Project, and UFPJ's Global Justice Working Group. &quot;The nomination of Wolfowitz adds new urgency to the protests planned against the World Bank and IMF on April 15-17, confirming that the Bush Administration is seeking to expand U.S. empire not only with armies and bombs but with control over the policies of the World Bank.&quot;</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>More information about the upcoming protests can be found at the United for Peace and Justice website, <a href="http://www.unitedforpeace.org/" target="_new">http://www.unitedforpeace.org</a>.</i></font></p><p align="LEFT"><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">United for Peace and Justice is the largest U.S. peace and justice coalition, with more than 1,000 groups under its umbrella. Since its founding in October 2002, UFPJ has spurred hundreds of protests and rallies around the country, including the two largest demonstrations against the Iraq war.</font></i></p><p align="LEFT">&nbsp;</p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
