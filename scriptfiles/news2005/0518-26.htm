<p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">NEW YORK, NY -- May 19 -- According to attorneys with the Center for Constitutional Rights (CCR), a New York-based human rights organization, the United States Government has failed to adequately investigate consistent reports of the use of religious humiliation as an integral component of the systematic abuse of prisoners during interrogations at Guant&aacute;namo and elsewhere.  A substantial number of these reports, made by former prisoners as well as by current prisoners and their legal counsel, have subsequently been confirmed by government documents.  The government has  responded to the mounting evidence of prisoner abuse with either outright denials that the misconduct occurred or with the justification that the abuse was part of an approved interrogation strategy.  To date, there have been only limited inquiries lacking the necessary objectivity, transparency, and accountability.  </font></p><p align="LEFT"> </p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The true outrage underlying Newsweek's retraction is that the White House has never aggressively denounced the religious humiliation or physical and psychological abuse of devout Muslims imprisoned at Guant&aacute;namo with anything close to the same vigor that it has criticized Newsweek, even when such abuses have later been confirmed by the government's own documents,&quot; observed CCR's Director-Counsel Barbara Olshansky.  &quot;The Administration's efforts are focused solely on shifting the focus from its unlawful conduct to reporters and media organizations - which, in the absence of any independent investigation - are the only source of information about the government's misdeeds.&quot; </font></p><p align="LEFT"> </p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Government has routinely denied allegations of abuse made by Guant&aacute;namo detainees as outlandish, until disclosures of internal government documents confirmed that the abuses occurred.  For example, religious humiliation at Guant&aacute;namo has been designed to violate Muslim tenets prohibiting contact between unmarried men and women as well as open displays of sexuality:</font></p><p align="LEFT"> </p><p align="LEFT"><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Use of &quot;Prostitutes&quot; at Guant&aacute;namo Bay</font></b></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In March 2004 and again in January 2005, released prisoners made allegations that &quot;prostitutes&quot; were paraded in front of the detainees and that during interrogations they made sexual advances towards prisoners and smeared menstrual blood on the men, who were shackled and unable to pull away. <br></font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Department of Defense initially dismissed these allegations, declaring that the prisoners were trained at terrorist camps to make such false allegations. <br>Internal government correspondence leaked in December 2004 revealed that in July 2004, a deputy director of the F.B.I. expressed concern to the Pentagon over the use of sexual tactics at Guant&aacute;namo, which he viewed as &quot;highly aggressive.&quot; <br></font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the face of numerous reports of such abuse, Lt. Col. James Marshall, a spokesman for U.S. Southern Command, refused in late January 2005 to comment on whether the government intentionally used female interrogators with Muslim detainees.  He claimed that &quot;U.S. forces treat all detainees and conduct all interrogations, wherever they may occur, humanely and consistent with U.S. legal obligations, and in particular with legal obligations prohibiting torture.&quot; <br></font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Eric Saar, a former interrogator at Guant&aacute;namo, confirmed in January 2005 that female interrogators used red ink to simulate menstrual blood during interrogations and to cause the psychological breakdown of prisoners. <br></font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On May 6, 2005, the State Department announced that only 10 soldiers had been reprimanded or received minor punishments and that one solider faced a court-martial as a result of investigations at Guant&aacute;namo into the plethora of abuse reports, including those related to sexual abuse or humiliation.  The report stated that two female interrogators had been reprimanded. <br></font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As of March 2005, one of the female interrogators was teaching soldiers interrogation techniques at the Army Intelligence School in Fort Huachuca, Arizona, despite the 2003 reprimand for her sexual humiliation tactics, including smearing fake menstrual blood on prisoners.<br> </font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Religious Humiliation Using the Israeli Flag</b></font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In a habeas petition filed on November 8, 2004 by his attorney, Lt. Col. Sharon A. Shaffer, Mr. Ibrahim Ahmed Mahmoud Al Qosi stated that he and other prisoners were wrapped in Israeli flags and sexually humiliated by female interrogators who rubbed their bodies against devout Muslim prisoners.  <br>Similar allegations were made in November 2004 by Mr. Jum'ah Al Dossari, still imprisoned in Gaunt&aacute;namo.  Mr. Al Dossari claimed that during an interrogation in Camp Delta, an interrogator wrapped Mr. Al Dossari in Israeli and U.S. flags.  The interrogator told Mr. Al Dossari that a holy war was occurring, between the Cross and the Star of David on the one hand, and the Crescent on the other. <br></font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Department of Defense refused to comment on these allegations. <br></font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On December 15, 2004, the government was ordered by the court to disclose an email dated July 30, 2004 sent by an F.B.I. agent, stating that he had observed a detainee &quot;with an Israeli flag draped around him&quot; and who was being subjected to loud music and strobe lightening, a form of sensory over-stimulation.  The agent reported this incident because it was his understanding that &quot;such techniques were not allowed.&quot;<br> </font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">These reports, as well as documents disclosed by the Government in the FOIA litigation brought by CCR and others, reveal a systemic use of religious humiliation practices which include, in addition to desecration and mishandling of the Koran, the sexual taunting of detainees and the wrapping of prisoners in Israeli flags, depriving detainees of long pants during prayer times so they cannot properly cover themselves, the deliberate interference with prayers, and, most-recently, the use of religious slurs directed towards detainees' attorneys. </font></p><p align="LEFT"> </p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Gitanjali Gutierrez, CCR Cooperating Attorney, stated, &quot;These frequent incidents involved more than the errant conduct of a few interrogators.  It is clear that the White House wants to silence critics, cloud the truth, and hide the systematic religious humiliation of prisoners by the U.S. government.  We can no longer tolerate secrecy and denial about the government's conduct in Guant&aacute;namo.&quot;</font></p><p align="LEFT"> </p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;A thorough and transparent independent investigation of the actions of U.S. officials is critical to restoring the role of the United States as a world leader,&quot; stated CCR President Michael Ratner. &quot;In light of the denials by the U.S. military and its inability to self-regulate, our government's only option is to appoint an independent commission or special prosecutor to investigate prisoner abuses in U.S. detention facilities around the world and to ensure that those who have violated the law are held responsible for their crimes.&quot;<br></font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
