<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -  July 11 - Today, the Rev. Dr. C. Welton Gaddy, President of  The Interfaith Alliance, condemned the hate crimes committed Saturday at  St. John's Reformed Church (UCC) in Middlebrook, Virginia where a fire was set in the sanctuary and anti-gay graffiti was painted on the building. Despite the crimes, the United Church of Christ congregation celebrated their 225th anniversary Sunday with hope and strong community support. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Our thoughts and encouragement are with the St. John congregation as they move forward following this malicious attack,&quot; Rev. Gaddy said. &quot;On behalf of TIA, I would like to offer congratulations and admiration to the members of the Middlebrook community for coming together on such short notice and helping the congregation celebrate their historic legacy. We hope the community support continues and is strengthened in order to prevent such atrocities in the future.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On the Fourth of July the United Church of Christ's General Synod overwhelmingly approved a resolution endorsing same-gender marriage, making it the largest Christian denomination supporting marriage rights for all. The anti-gay attack Saturday followed that vote. The policy does not automatically apply to all 5,700 congregations, because each UCC church is autonomous. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Last year, the UCC denomination also ran national television ads stating that Jesus ministered to all people and that the UCC is open to anyone who wishes to attend. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to the FBI, hate crimes against a person's religious views are the second most common in the United States, behind those of race. The UCC's Central Atlantic Conference Minister said this is the third such attack this year against churches in the Shenandoah Valley since the church publicly welcomed gays and lesbians. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The Interfaith Alliance urges everyone to raise a united voice against all hate crimes,&quot; Rev. Gaddy said. &quot;Ending hate violence depends on people of faith and goodwill acting courageously to stand up against all religious bigotry and hate-filled acts. This is just one reason why passage of hate crimes legislation is so urgent. As the world's most religiously diverse nation we celebrate and fiercely defend religious freedom for all.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Although The Interfaith Alliance has not taken a position on same-gender marriage, TIA has opposed the proposed Federal Marriage Amendment in Congress on the basis of the amendment's infringement on religious liberty. The following statement was announced in a press release, dated April 22, 2004:</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Statement of The Interfaith Alliance on the Proposed Federal Marriage Amendment</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Interfaith Alliance, a nonpartisan national grassroots organization dedicated to promoting the positive and healing role of religion in public life, urges the United States Congress to soundly reject the Federal Marriage Amendment (H.J. Res. 56/ S.J. Res. 26); sponsored in the House of Representatives by Representative Marilyn Musgrave (R-CO) and in the Senate by Senator Wayne Allard (R-CO). </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We oppose the Federal Marriage Amendment because it shows an indisputable disregard for religious liberty and a fundamental disrespect for the diversity of approaches to marriage within faith traditions. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As a mainstream religious organization of over 150,000 people of faith and goodwill who come from over 70 faith traditions, we believe that people of faith in a religiously pluralistic society are bound together by shared principles of compassion, civility and mutual respect for human dignity. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">While pronounced differences exist within our collective religious traditions in regard to the recognition of same-gender relationships, The Interfaith Alliance strives to model a dialogue between faith traditions that upholds our shared principles while neither critiquing nor evaluating the theology or practice of any faith tradition. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Few rituals within religious traditions are as sacred and central to the identity of a religious body as marriage. Indeed, the Constitution appropriately bars any court or any legislature from requiring a religious institution to perform these rites and further, allows houses of worship the freedom to limit marriages on whatever theological grounds they choose. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Regardless of judicial and legislative decisions, which define a civil marriage within a geographical jurisdiction, The Interfaith Alliance honors and respects the sovereignty of individual faith traditions to determine what they choose to recognize as a religious marriage. This is, in our view, consistent with our primary mission of upholding and strengthening religious liberty. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Respecting the rights of those in our diverse communities of faith who deem same-gender marriage to be consistent with their religious creed ensures that the United States will continue to be the most religiously pluralistic country in the world. We firmly believe that it is not the purview of our government to enshrine in our laws the beliefs of one particular faith tradition over others. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Finally, our call to unite the nation under the banner of mutual respect for human dignity requires us to ensure that all Americans are protected equally under the law. Any amendment to our Constitution that denies some Americans the same rights as afforded their neighbors demeans us all.  </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We urge the United States Congress to retain religious freedom and dignity for all and defeat this unnecessary and divisive Constitutional amendment. </font></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p align="CENTER"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">###</font></p><!-- #EndEditable -->
