<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SALT LAKE CITY, UT -- March 31 -- </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Today from the Utah State Capitol, Congressman Rob Bishop announced his plans to reintroduce legislation in the U.S. Congress that would prevent high-level nuclear waste storage in Utah&#146;s West Desert, preserve Utah&#146;s military training capabilities, and protect a magnificent, desert range known as the Cedar Mountains as wilderness. The Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance, The Wilderness Society, and the Sierra Club joined with the Utah congressional delegation, Governor Jon Huntsman, and a coalition of citizens opposing nuclear waste storage in Utah to voice support for reintroduction of the Utah Test and Training Range Protection Act.</font><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In addition to wilderness designation for the Cedar Mountains, the legislation continues the effort to address longstanding public concern over a proposed nuclear waste storage facility on the Goshute Indian Reserveration just 40 miles from downtown Salt Lake City and adjacent to the Utah Test and Training Range.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;This legislation accomplishes something that&#146;s never been done before in Utah &#150; unanimous agreement on a Utah wilderness proposal,&#148; said Heidi McIntosh, Conservation Director for the Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance. &#147;Congressman Bishop&#146;s bill is a win-win proposal for both the people and the wild and unique public lands of Utah.&#148;</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Bishop&#146;s bill makes important headway for wilderness in the West Desert. The legislation would designate the Cedar Mountain area of the West Desert as wilderness, preserving roughly 100,000 acres of remarkable west desert landscape. Currently, only half of the proposed Cedar Mountain Wilderness Area lacks any form of special protection.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;This bill turns a new page on Utah wilderness,&#148; said Suzanne Jones of The Wilderness Society. &#147;We thank Congressman Bishop for his leadership in crafting legislation that succeeds in protecting jobs, the environment, and our rich quality of life.&#148;</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If enacted, Rep. Bishop&#146;s bill would represent the first wilderness legislation in Utah for desert lands managed by the Bureau of Land Management. With only about 800,000 acres of wilderness, predominately on National Forest lands, and only a few thousand acres of wilderness on its borders with Colorado and Arizona, Utah has less wilderness land than any of the eleven western states. &#147;At less than an hour&#146;s drive from downtown Salt Lake City, the Cedar Mountain Wilderness offers Utahns a readily accessible opportunity to enjoy the peace and quiet of the West Desert,&#148; said Wayne Hoskisson, Utah Representative for Sierra Club. &#147;Creating this wilderness area adds to the quality of life for all Utahns.&#148;</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The proposed Cedar Mountains Wilderness lies on the eastern edge of the Great Salt Lake Desert within easy driving distance from Salt Lake City. The Cedar Mountains are home to elk, deer, pronghorn antelope, coyote, bobcats, bats, golden eagles, wild horses, red-tailed hawks, ravens, reptiles, and occasionally, mountain lions. The 100,000 acre area is a prime example of western Utah's unique basin and range topography featuring pinyon and juniper covered mountain peaks rising over 6,000 feet in elevation.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">During the 108th Congress, the Utah Wilderness Coalition and its member groups, the Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance, The Wilderness Society, and the Sierra Club, worked with Congressman Bishop to develop a wilderness provision that all parties could agree to. Congressman Bishop then introduced the Utah Test and Training Range Protection Act, with support from the conservation community, and successfully guided it through the House of Representatives. Unfortunately time ran out and Congress recessed last fall before the Senate could take up the measure.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Statement read at press conference by Utah Wilderness Coalition</b></font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Thank you Congressman Bishop.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On behalf of the Utah Wilderness Coalition and its member organizations, the Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance, The Wilderness Society, the Sierra Club, and the Wasatch Mountain Club, I&#146;d like to express our appreciation for your leadership protecting the Utah Test and Training Range and the Cedar Mountain Wilderness. I&#146;d also like to extend our thanks to Governor Jon Huntsman for being so involved on this important issue. We also appreciate being joined by Congressman Chris Cannon and our friends at the Utah Defense Alliance.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Utah Wilderness Coalition enthusiastically supports the legislation that Congressman Bishop is announcing today and looks forward to working with this broader coalition to ensure its swift passage in Congress. This legislation brings together the concerns voiced by Utahns and points towards a common solution that will protect our environment, jobs, and quality of life.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The legislation also accomplishes something unprecedented in Utah history &#150; unanimous agreement on a proposal for Utah wilderness. Under this compromise, we would designate the Cedar Mountains area of the West Desert as wilderness, preserving roughly 100,000 acres of remarkable west desert landscape. Currently, more than half of the proposed Cedar Mountain Wilderness Area lacks any form of special protection.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Representative Bishop&#146;s bill also marks progress in another important way. If enacted, the wilderness proposal would give Utah its first congressionally designated BLM-managed wilderness area wholly located within the state. We all know Utah is home to some of the most breath-taking wild places in the world, yet our state has less protected wilderness than any of the eleven western states. The Cedar Mountains proposal begins to recognize the value of preserving our wild places.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Cedar Mountain range truly deserves to be designated as wilderness. It is a magnificent area easily accessible from Salt Lake City and yet rich with sweeping views of the West Desert and unending opportunities for solitude, peace, and quiet. Protecting this stunning desert mountain range from development and off-road vehicle abuse will ensure that this local treasure will continue to be available for generations to come.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We are extremely pleased to join all of those concerned about protecting Utah&#146;s quality of life and wild places in this effort. This proposal is a win-win for citizens and our public lands, and we thank Rep. Bishop again for his leadership in this endeavor.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Thank you.</font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
