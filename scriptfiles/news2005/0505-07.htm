<p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- May 5 -- On May 2, The James Beard Foundation honored Judy Wicks, founder and proprietress of the White Dog Cafe with the James Beard Foundation Humanitarian of the Year Award, presented before a crowd of 1700 industry leaders at the Marriot Marquis in New York City. The awards recognize excellence and achievement in the culinary profession. </font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;The significance of The James Beard Foundation Awards is that nominees and winners are selected by their peers,&#148; said Dorothy Cann Hamilton, President of The James Beard Foundation. &#147;To win a James Beard Foundation Award is the highest honor in the industry a culinary professional can achieve.&#148; </font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The award described the White Dog Cafe as &#147;a flourishing, virtually utopian model of social responsibility, community activism, and international and environmental concern &#150; while providing great eats, of course.&#148; Also highlighted in the award was the White Dog&#146;s nonprofit, the White Dog Cafe Foundation which works to build a local living economy in the Philadelphia region, and the Business Alliance for Local Living Economies, of which Wicks is co-founder and co-chair. </font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;Being a humanitarian is not simply about giving to the needy, but rather about how we spend our purchasing dollar during our normal business day,&#148; said Wicks in her acceptance speech. &#147;Directing those dollars toward family farms, especially those that raise farm animals humanely can really make a difference.  There is such suffering in the factory farm system.  The restaurant industry has the power to improve the lives of the pigs, cows and chickens who provide so much to us by purchasing from farmers who raise them with respect and care.&#148;</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">   Now in its 15th year, The James Beard Foundation Awards recognize cookbook authors, restaurants, chefs, food and beverage journalists, broadcasters, and restaurant and graphic designers. Charles Gibson, co-host ABC&#146;s Good Morning America, served as master of ceremonies.  A black tie gala followed - a tribute to Julia Child, which featured dozens of nationally known chefs from around the country including Child&#146;s friend Jacques Pepin, who won the Lifetime Achievement Award. </font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Wicks is also featured in this month&#146;s Oprah Magazine, (&#147;Taste the Love&#148; pg. 350) for her work supporting local farmers and building local living economies. </font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">White Dog Enterprises, Inc. employees just over 100 people between the 200+ seat White Dog Cafe and gift store, The Black Cat.
