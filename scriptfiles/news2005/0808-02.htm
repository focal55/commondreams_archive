<td colspan="2"><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">NEW YORK - August 8 - A lawsuit filed today against U.S.   
Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld reveals the gratuitous   
cruelty inflicted on a foreign student held without charges for more   
than two years as an &quot;enemy combatant&quot; in a South Carolina naval   
brig, Human Rights Watch said. Although three men have been   
confined in the United States after being designated &quot;enemy   
combatants&quot; by President George Bush, the complaint by Ali Saleh   
Kahlah al-Marri provides the first look into the treatment of any of   
them in military custody.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Ali Saleh Kahlah al-Marri, a citizen of Qatar who had been   
studying in Peoria, Illinois, before his arrest, asked the federal   
district court in South Carolina to declare unconstitutional the   
severe and unnecessary deprivations and restrictions to which he   
has been subjected since he was placed in military custody in June   
2003. Al-Marri had already initiated habeas proceedings   
challenging the legality of his detention as an enemy combatant.   
That case continues. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;It is bad enough that al-Marri has been held indefinitely without   
charges and incommunicado,&quot; said Jamie Fellner, director of   
Human Rights Watch's U.S. Program. &quot;Now we learn that his life   
in the brig has also been one of cruelty and petty vindictiveness.   
Whatever the Bush administration believes he has done or wanted   
to do, there's no excuse for how they are treating him.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Al-Marri's complaint describes virtually complete isolation from   
the world. He has been confined round the clock in a small cell   
with an opaque window covered with plastic. He has not been   
allowed to speak to his wife or five children. He is allowed no   
newspapers, magazines, books (other than the Koran), radio or   
television. He is allowed no personal property. His cell contains a   
steel bed, a sink and a toilet. During the day, the mattress on his   
bed has been removed.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Out-of-cell time has been limited to three showers and three short   
periods of solitary recreation a week-but al-Marri has frequently   
been denied that out-of-cell time. Once he went 60 days without   
being permitted to leave his cell at all. When bad weather prevents   
him from going outside, he must remain in hand cuffs and leg irons   
during his indoor recreation. Leg irons and handcuffs are placed on   
him when he goes to the shower.   
  
</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Al-Marri alleges that on occasion he has been denied basic hygiene   
products such as a toothbrush, toothpaste, soap and toilet paper.   
When not provided with toilet paper, he has had to use his hands to   
clean himself after he defecates, and it has taken more than an hour   
before soap was brought to him so that he could wash his hands.   
The water in his cell has frequently been turned off. He has been   
denied socks or footwear for months at a time, including during the   
winter months. Officers at the brig often lower the temperature in   
his cell until it becomes exceedingly cold, but they do not give him   
extra clothes or blankets to keep warm.   
  
</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">According to al-Marri's complaint, he has not been formally   
interrogated for almost one year. He states, however, that when he   
was interrogated, government officials threatened he would be sent   
to Egypt or Saudi Arabia, where they told him he would be   
tortured and sodomized and his wife would be raped in front of   
him.   
  
</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For more than a year, al-Marri was not allowed to speak with any   
non-governmental personnel other than representatives of the   
International Committee of the Red Cross. Military personnel   
guarding him would not talk to him other than to give him orders.   
In October 2004, the government finally agreed to let him have   
access to counsel.   
  
</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Al-Marri is a devout Muslim. According to his complaint, military   
officials have not permitted him to meet with a Muslim cleric, do   
not let him have a prayer mat and punish him if he follows his   
religion's requirement to cover his head while he prays (he uses a   
shirt for this purpose). They do not tell him which way Mecca lies,   
so he does not know in which direction to pray; nor do they   
provide him with a clock, so he does not know when to pray. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;It's the combination of restrictions imposed on al-Marri that   
offends basic norms of decency,&quot; said Fellner. &quot;There is no   
security justification for them. The Pentagon apparently believes it   
can hold him under any conditions they choose for as long as they   
choose.&quot;   
  
Al-Marri also claims he has been denied appropriate care for   
medical and mental health symptoms he has developed while in the   
brig. Prolonged solitary confinement pushes the boundary of what   
humans can psychologically tolerate. It can cause serious mental   
damage.   
  
</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Al-Marri is a citizen of Qatar who lawfully resided in the United   
States, having come with his wife and children to obtain a graduate   
degree at Bradley University in Peoria, Illinois, the same university   
from which he had earned a bachelor's degree 10 years earlier. The   
Federal Bureau of Investigation arrested al-Marri at his home in   
December 2001 as a material witness in the investigation of the   
September 11 attacks, and he was subsequently indicted on federal   
charges of credit card fraud and lying to the FBI.   
  
</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 2003, President Bush designated al-Marri an enemy combatant,   
and shortly before his criminal trial was to begin, the criminal   
charges against him were dismissed, and he was sent to the   
Consolidated Naval Brig in North Charleston, South Carolina.   
Lawyers for al-Marri immediately challenged the President's   
actions in federal district court in Illinois, where his criminal case   
had been pending, but the courts ultimately held that this challenge   
had to be brought in the district where al-Marri was presently   
confined. On July 7, 2004, counsel for al-Marri filed a writ of   
habeas corpus in federal district court in South Carolina,   
challenging the lawfulness of his detention. On July 8, 2005, the   
court ruled that President Bush has the authority to detain non- citizens who had been residing in the United States as enemy   
combatants.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Human Rights Watch condemns the designation by presidential   
order of any civilian as an &quot;enemy combatant&quot; when the individual   
was detained far from any battlefield. Holding someone in military   
custody without charges because of such a designation constitutes   
a violation of the prohibition against arbitrary detention under   
international law. By treating al-Marri as an &quot;enemy combatant,&quot;   
the Bush administration made an end-run around the due process   
and other constitutional guarantees of the U.S. criminal justice   
system.   
  
</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Human Rights Watch disputes the government's contention that   
the laws of war permit holding al-Marri indefinitely and without   
charges. Those laws are not applicable outside areas of armed   
conflict and where there is no direct connection to an armed   
conflict. In the case of a civilian detained within the United   
States-whether or not affiliated with any terrorist organization- international human rights and constitutional law require that he be   
formally charged and given a fair trial before a civilian court.   
  
</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Al-Marri is one of three men whom President Bush has designated   
as enemy combatants in the U.S. campaign against terrorism and   
who have been confined within the territorial United States.   
Lawyers for all three went to court challenging the lawfulness of   
their detentions. The government in each case insisted the   
president has the authority to decide unilaterally who is an enemy   
combatant and that anyone so designated is not entitled to a   
judicial hearing.   
</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The first case was that of Yassir Hamdi, a U.S. citizen turned over   
to U.S. forces during the fighting in Afghanistan. In June 2004, the   
Supreme Court ruled that he was entitled to his day in court; the   
United States chose not to proceed with a hearing and allowed   
Hamdi to go to Saudi Arabia, where he also held citizenship.   
  
</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The second designated enemy combatant was Jose Padilla, a U.S.   
citizen detained at Chicago's O'Hare Airport upon his return from   
the Middle East. According to the Bush Administration, Padilla   
had plotted with Al-Qaeda to commit terrorist acts in the United   
States. In June 2004, the Supreme Court ruled he had to bring his   
case before the federal district court in South Carolina, where he is   
being confined in the same navy brig as al-Marri. On February 28,   
2005, the federal district court in South Carolina ruled that   
President Bush had &quot;no power, neither express nor implied, neither   
constitutional nor statutory&quot; to hold Padilla as an enemy   
combatant.</font></p>
