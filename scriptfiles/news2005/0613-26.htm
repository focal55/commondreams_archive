<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON, D.C. -- In a new Mason-Dixon poll released today, 
registered voters said by a greater than 3-1 margin that they don't 
want the federal government to arrest medical marijuana patients, even 
though the Supreme Court has given it permission to do so. In the poll, conducted June 8-11, 68% of voters said medical marijuana patients 
should not be arrested, compared to just 16% who said they should. 
Responses varied little by party, age, or gender, with 63% of 
Republicans, 73% of Democrats, and 68% of independents agreeing that 
medical marijuana patients should not be arrested. Full details of 
the survey are available at <a href="http://www.mpp.org/2005MasonDixonPoll" target="_new">http://www.mpp.org/2005MasonDixonPoll</a> .

  </font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">  The survey was released as Supreme Court plaintiff Angel Raich 
joined religious and medical leaders in an appeal to Congress to pass 
the Hinchey-Rohrabacher Amendment, which would bar the Justice 
Department from using any of its funding to interfere with state 
medical marijuana laws. The amendment is expected to be voted on by 
the House of Representatives as early as Tuesday.

     </font><p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Last week the Supreme Court said that patients like me must ask 
Congress to protect us from being arrested and jailed for the simple 
act of taking our medicine," said Raich, who suffers from an 
inoperable brain tumor, life-threatening wasting syndrome, and a 
number of other serious illnesses. "Today, I am asking the House of 
Representatives to do just that by passing the Hinchey-Rohrabacher 
Amendment. Every House member needs to understand that a vote against 
this amendment is a vote to sentence me to death -- and to sentence many thousands of severely ill Americans to needless suffering and pain."

    </font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">  In a letter being sent to Congress today, the United Methodist 
Church declares, "Seriously ill people should not be subject to 
criminal sanctions for using marijuana if the patient's physician has 
told the patient that such use is likely to be beneficial. ... We 
strongly urge you to support an amendment ... that would prohibit the 
use of federal funds for prosecuting patients, doctors and caregivers 
who are following state law."

     </font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Another letter of support is coming from the American Nurses 
Association (ANA), which has consistently supported legal access to 
medical marijuana. The ANA supported a similar proposal last year, 
writing, "ANA opposes the U.S. Department of Justice's willingness to 
pursue seriously ill people who only seek relief from chronic 
illnesses, and who are complying with their states' laws."

    </font><p>  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"This new poll confirms that it is not only politically safe for 
House members to vote to protect patients from arrest, but that it's 
politically risky for them to vote to against protecting patients from 
arrest," said Rob Kampia, executive director of the Marijuana Policy 
Project in Washington, D.C. "This is one of those happy situations 
where good policy and good politics are one and the same, and we hope 
Congress is listening."

nationwide, the Marijuana Policy Project is the largest marijuana 
policy reform organization in the United States. MPP works to 
minimize the harm associated with marijuana - both the consumption 
of marijuana and the laws that are intended to prohibit such use. 
MPP believes that the greatest harm associated with marijuana is 
imprisonment. For more information, please visit <a href="http://www.mpp.org/" target="_new">MarijuanaPolicy.org</a></font><p align="CENTER"><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">###</font><!-- #EndEditable --></td></tr>
