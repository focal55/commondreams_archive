<p>WASHINGTON  - December 16 - James Brady, chair of  the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, issued the following  statement today on crime guns: </p>
<p>   &quot;For several years, New York elected officials have had  arguments about what to do to combat the terrible problem of  firearms getting into the hands of criminals. There is a lot of  finger pointing going on. </p>
<p>   &quot;We need to make it tougher for criminals to get guns. The  best way to do that is to pass laws to make it easier to  prosecute gun traffickers by lowering the number of guns required  to prove a crime, and pass laws that force unscrupulous gun  dealers to change their behavior.  Speaker Silver's proposal has  both of these components.  The Governor and the State Senate  should adopt this approach.  New York should toughen the  penalties, but also take real steps to dry up the sources of  crime guns. </p>
<p>   &quot;The only thing keeping New York from reaching a deal on this  is politics.  Governor Pataki and the State Senate need to take a  hard look at the Assembly's gun package and pass laws that will  keep law enforcement officers safe and provide them with the  tools they need cut off the flood of illegal guns.</p>
<p>   &quot;Sarah and I extend our deep condolences to the families of  the police officers lost in recent weeks.  The families, and the  larger police family in New York and across America, deserve our  gratitude for their service.&quot;
