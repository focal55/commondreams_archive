<p>WASHINGTON - This week, the House of Representatives is expected to consider an amendment to the Federal Housing Reform Act, H.R. 1461, that would limit the ability of American citizens to engage in our democratic process. This amendment must be removed from H.R. 1461 when it comes to the House floor the week of October 24. <br>
Take action now! <br>
Alarmingly, this amendment would restrict non-profit organizations from participating in non-partisan political activities. It would block non-profits from engaging in non-partisan voter registration and get-out-the-vote activities in the 12 months prior to applying for grants through the Affordable Housing Fund. The amendment further prohibits non-profits that receive grant funds from subsequently engaging in these very important activities. <br>
The amendment is very broad, prohibiting non-partisan voter registration at any time, not just prior to an election, and barring non-profit organizations from receiving a housing grant if it is merely &quot;affiliated&quot; with a group that engages in any prohibited political activity.<br>
The League of Women Voters believes that democratic government depends on the informed and active participation of its citizens at all levels of government. It is unacceptable that this amendment would try to restrict participation in non-partisan political activities.<br>
The United States Congress should be promoting the values and processes of democratic government, not attempting to limit them. Tell your Representative to oppose this ill-advised amendment!<br>
<p>ACTION NEEDED<br>
<p>1. Contact your Representative in the U.S. House now, by phone and by email, and urge her/him to oppose the provision in H.R. 1461 to restrict voter registration activities by non-profit organizations. Phone calls can be made through the Capitol Hill switchboard at 202-224-3121 or 202-225-3121. Or, simply click here to enter your zip code and send an instant message to your Representative now! <br>
<p>2. Send this email alert to other concerned citizens&mdash;your grassroots network, your friends and coworkers. Encourage them to contact their Representatives today! <br>
