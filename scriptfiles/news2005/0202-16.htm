<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- February 2 -- &quot;The Sierra Club today applauds Senator Joseph Lieberman (D-CT) and Representatives Ed Markey (D-MA) and Nancy Johnson (R-CT) and other Members of Congress who today introduced bipartisan legislation to designate the coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge as Wilderness. We are grateful to these Senators and Representatives today for offering an alternative vision for this majestic landscape and seeking to end the tug of war over its fate.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;It is significant that these Members stand together today urging protection for the Arctic Refuge. Despite overwhelming public support for protecting the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, the Bush administration and Congressional leadership continue to push measures to open the Refuge to drilling. President Bush is expected to once again include drilling revenues in his budget next week, and drilling proponents in Congress will try to attach the controversial drilling provisions to their budgets.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;There&#146;s simply too much at stake to let this majestic national icon become a number in the federal budget. The Refuge serves as the staging area for hundreds of thousands of migratory birds, denning habitat for polar bears, and calving grounds for the 130,000 member Porcupine River caribou herd. Moreover, the Refuge plays an integral part in the lives of the Gwich'in people who depend on the seasonal migrations of the caribou for both survival and cultural identity.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The speculative revenue gains are too small and the sacrifice too great to jeopardize our natural heritage for a short-term supply of oil. We urge permanent protection for the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, and the Arctic Wilderness Protection Act would safeguard this land for future generations.&quot;</font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
