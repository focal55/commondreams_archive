<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- February 2 -- </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Members of Military Families Speak Out, an organization of over 2,000 families with loved ones in the military, Gold Star Families for Peace, an organization with over 25 families whose loved ones died as a result of the war in Iraq and Iraq Veterans Against the War, an organization of over 150 Iraq War Veterans, are available for interview to discuss their responses to Bush's 2005 State of the Union Address. Families and Veterans will be able to respond to topics such as:</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Elections in Iraq: despite declarations of success, many families and Veterans see Jan. 30, 2005 as yet another in a series &quot;banner days&quot; that have never lived up to their promises. May 1, 2003 was the &quot;end of major combat.&quot; 140 U.S. soldiers were killed during &quot;major combat;&quot; 1,298 have been killed since. Dec. 14, 2003 brought the capture of Saddam Hussein; the insurgency has grown significantly stronger since then. June 28, 2004 was the so- called &quot;transfer of power&quot;; U.S. military occupation continued and violence escalated. Despite the elections in Iraq, 150,000 U.S. troops remain with no clear date for their return home.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Lack of Exit Strategy: Twenty-four Members of Congress have signed a resolution to bring the troops home now; Senators and members of Congress are discussing ideas ranging from &quot;bring them home now&quot; to &quot;bring them home soon.&quot; The Bush Administration sent troops to Iraq based on lies, and continues to keep them there with no end in sight.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">$80 Billion Supplemental to Continue the War in Iraq: Military Families Speak Out, Gold Star Families for Peace and Iraq Veterans Against the War say &quot;NO to funding to continue this war. Any new appropriations concerning troops in Iraq should be directed solely towards bringing the troops home and taking care of them when they get here.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>EDITOR'S NOTE: Military Families, Gold Star Families and Iraq War Veterans are available for interview for thoughts and response on tonights State of the Union Address.
