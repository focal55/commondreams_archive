<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- January 13 --  Legislators who voted against state constitutional amendments banning same sex marriage rarely faced negative consequences when running for reelection in November, according to a report issued by the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force Policy Institute.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Institute's report, Impact of Voting against Anti-gay Marriage Amendments on 2004 Re-election Campaigns in Five Midwestern States, analyzed the election results in Iowa, Illinois, Michigan, Wisconsin, and Minnesota, where state legislatures had voted in 2004 on constitutional amendments seeking to ban marriage between same-sex couples, and in some cases, any form of partner recognition such as civil unions or domestic partnerships. The report found:</font></p><ul><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Voting against anti-gay marriage amendments did not hurt incumbents' chances of re-election.</font></li></ul><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If anything, it may have helped. The report found that 97% (100 of 103) of state legislators who voted against anti-gay constitutional amendments and ran for re-election won their races, compared to 91% of state legislators who voted for them ( 196 of 215) . In all five states combined, 19 legislators who voted for anti-gay amendments lost their seats. Only 3 legislators who voted against these amendments lost their seats.</font></p><ul><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> In Iowa and Minnesota, legislators who voted against these amendments fared significantly better than their anti-gay colleagues.</font></li></ul><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In Iowa, all 7 legislators who voted against the anti-gay amendment were re-elected, compared to 71% (10 of 14) of those who voted for it. In Minnesota, 98% (40 of 41) of House members who voted against the anti-gay amendment were re-elected, compared to 86% of those who voted for it.</font></p><ul><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Republican legislators did not receive any electoral benefit from supporting anti-gay amendments in these five states.</font></li></ul><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In Michigan, Democrats picked up seats, closing the Republican majority in the House from 63-46 to 58-52. Although all Iowa Democrats voted against the anti-gay constitutional amendment, the Democrats picked up a net four seats, evening the balance of power in the Senate in which the majority had been Republican.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;This study shows that contrary to threats and demagoguery of extreme right, legislators who take a stand against marriage discrimination rarely suffer consequences at the polls,&quot; said Matt Foreman, the Task Force's Executive Director.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The Task Force report confirms what I already know to be true,&quot; said State Senator D. Scott Dibble of Minneapolis, &quot;legislators can be confident that when they cast a vote to reflect the courage of their convictions, the people of their district respect them. We found out in Minnesota that not giving in to the politics of distraction and fear allowed us to cut through the hyperbole and speak directly withy voters about the real priorities facing t our state. The election was a strong repudiation of those who would divert our attention and divide Minnesotans against each other.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The state legislatures in Iowa, Minnesota, and Illinois did not pass anti-marriage constitutional amendments during the 2004 legislative sessions. In November 2004, although the vote to pass the amendment failed in the Michigan legislature, voters approved a sweeping anti-marriage/anti-civil-union constitutional amendment by ballot initiative. Since its passage Michigan's governor rescinded domestic partner health coverage for state employees. Wisconsin's legislature passed its anti-gay amendment, but it must pass again this session before being sent to the voters for ratification.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Ann Marie DeGroot, Executive Director of OutFront Minnesota, encourages legislators considering any future anti-gay constitutional amendments to vote based on fairness, rather than fear. &quot;I hope that this gives legislators the courage not to fall for the bait of right-wing radicals who are trying to use this issue for their own extremist agendas.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Jeffrey Montgomery, Executive Director of the Triangle Foundation of Michigan, said, &quot;With this information we can, hopefully, end the scapegoating of 'gay issues' when candidates and parties lose, and see those defeats for what they are: failures to take a stand for fairness.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The report: Impact of Voting against Anti-Gay Marriage Amendments on 2004 Re-election Campaigns, can be found at <a href="http://www.thetaskforce.org/" target="_new">www.thetaskforce.org</a>, home page &quot;What's New&quot; column and/or publications section. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Founded in 1973, the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force Foundation (the Task Force) was the first national lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) civil rights and advocacy organization and remains the movement's leading voice for freedom, justice, and equality.
