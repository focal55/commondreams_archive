<p>WASHINGTON - December 9 - In light of the revelation today that prosecutors are preparing a bribery indictment against Rep. Bob Ney (R-OH), Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) is once again asking that a Member of the House forward CREW’s complaint against  Rep. Ney to the House Committee on Standards of Official Conduct. CREW has been searching for a member to file its complaint since March.<br />
<br />
Only Members of the House are permitted to file ethics complaints.<br />
<br />
“With today’s news that a bribery indictment against Rep. Bob Ney is likely forthcoming, we implore a Member of the House to finally file an ethics complaint against Rep. Ney,” Melanie Sloan, executive director of CREW said today. “We at CREW have been screaming from the rooftops about Rep. Ney’s corruption for nearly a year. Our calls for an investigation into Rep. Ney’s relationship with Jack Abramoff have fallen on deaf ears on both sides of the aisle. That should change with today’s development.” <br />
	<br />
Sloan continued, “the House has completely abdicated its constitutional responsibility to police itself.   The House ethics committee’s continued failure to act while the criminal investigations and indictments against  Members of Congress pile up is a national embarrassment.”<br />
<br />
Rep. Ney was listed as one of CREW’s 13 Most Corrupt Members of Congress in its Beyond DeLay report (<a href="http://www.beyonddelay.org">www.beyonddelay.org</a>). <br />
<br />
“Although Rep. Ney has repeatedly and adamantly denied any wrongdoing, it is clear, as it has been since these scandals first came to light, that he is lying.” Sloan concluded.</p>
