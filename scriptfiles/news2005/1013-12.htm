<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><P>WASHINGTON - The National Park Service has started using a political 
loyalty test for picking all its top civil service positions, according to an 
agency directive released today by Public Employees for Environmental 
Responsibility (PEER). Under the new order, all mid-level managers and above 
must also be approved by a Bush administration political appointee.</P>The 
October 11, 2005 order issued by NPS Director Fran Mainella requires that the 
selection criteria for all civil service management slots (Government Service 
grades or GS-13, 14 and 15) include the &#8220;ability to lead employees in achieving 
the &#8230;Secretary&#8217;s 4Cs and the President&#8217;s Management Agenda.&#8221; In addition, 
candidates must be screened by Park Service headquarters and &#8220;the Assistant 
Secretary [of Interior] for Fish, and Wildlife, and Parks,&#8221; the number three 
political appointee in the agency.<BR>
<P>The order represents a complete centralization of Park Service promotion and 
hiring in what has traditionally been a decentralized agency. More strikingly, 
the order is an unprecedented political intrusion into what are supposed to be 
non-partisan, merit system personnel decisions.</P>The President&#8217;s Management 
Agenda includes controversial policies and proposals such as aggressive use of 
outsourcing to replace civil servants, reliance on &#8220;faith-based initiatives&#8221; and 
rollbacks of civil service rights. Interior Secretary Gale Norton&#8217;s &#8220;4Cs&#8221; is a 
slogan she uses to express her management approach: &#8220;4 Cs: communication, 
consultation, cooperation, all in the service of conservation.&#8221;<BR>
<P>&#8220;It is outrageous that park superintendents must swear political loyalty to 
the Bush agenda and parrot hokey mottos in order to earn a promotion,&#8221; stated 
PEER Executive Director Jeff Ruch. &#8220;The merit system is supposed to be about 
ability, not apple polishing.&#8221;</P>The order applies to all hires for park 
superintendents, assistant superintendents and program managers, such as chief 
ranger or the head of interpretive or cultural programs. Overall, the policy 
applies to more than 1,000 mid-level management and supervisory positions in the 
Park Service.<BR>
<P>&#8220;Presidents come and go but the civil service is designed to serve whoever 
occupies the swivel chair in the Oval Office,&#8221; Ruch added. &#8220;It is downright 
creepy that now every museum curator, supervising scientist and chief ranger 
must be okayed by a high-level political appointee.&#8221;</P><!-- #EndEditable -->
