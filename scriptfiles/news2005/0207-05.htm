<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- February 7 -- Today the President is delivering his proposed federal budget to Congress. But there&#146;s one problem. The federal budget can be one of the most intricate and confusing documents. </font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It takes the guy who brought us Chunky Monkey to break it down into something we all understand, like Oreos.</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;Most people have a very different idea of how to spend our taxpayer dollars than what&#146;s in the President&#146;s proposal.&#148; Ben Cohen, now President of TrueMajorityACTION.org, says, &#147;We want Congresspeople to know what the priorities of the country are.&#148;</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Cohen&#146;s interactive, non-partisan form of democratic expression (<a href="http://www.truemajorityaction.org/cookiebudget" target="_new">www.truemajorityaction.org/cookiebudget</a>) begins by showing players how last year&#146;s federal budget was spent. Stacks of Oreo cookies, each representing a whopping $10 billion, are piled on 12 different budget categories (e.g., Pentagon, health, humanitarian foreign aid, etc.)</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Then, using a mouse, a player can click and drag Oreo cookies from one budget category to another, creating a federal budget tailored to his or her own values and priorities.</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For example, a player might drag 10 Oreos from the 45 cookies stacked on the &#147;Pentagon&#148; category and add them to them to the lonely Oreo on the &#147;Humanitarian Foreign Aid&#148; category.</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">After deciding where their Oreos stack up, TrueMajorityACTION members can instantly e-mail their proposed federal budget to their representatives in Washington.</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Last year, a Cohen-inspired online animation distributed to TrueMajorityACTION members, using Oreos to illustrate how Congress spends our taxes, was viewed by over 1 million people: View it at <a href="http://www.truemajorityaction.org/site/pp.asp?c=jvLUJdP8H&b=131898" target="_new">http://www.truemajorityaction.org/site/pp.asp?c=jvLUJdP8H&amp;b=131898</a></font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;You Stack the Oreos&#148; can be found at <a href="http://www.truemajorityaction.org/cookiebudget" target="_new">www.truemajorityaction.org/cookiebudget</a>. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>TrueMajorityACTION.org is a free e-service that monitors Congress on issues of justice, compassion, and sustainability. About twice a month, at critical moments, TrueMajorityACTION&#146;s 125,000 members receive a short e-mail alert about an important issue pending in Washington or about a good political candidate. With the click of a mouse, members can send a free fax to their Congressperson or take other actions to make a difference. Ben Cohen is undertaking this project on behalf of TrueMajorityAction and not on behalf of Ben &amp; Jerry's, which is not associated with the TrueMajorityAction campaign. <br></i></font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
