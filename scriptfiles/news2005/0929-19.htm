<p align="left">WASHINGTON - September 29 - A bipartisan group of lawmakers led by Congressman Kucinich (D-OH) and Congressman LaTourette (R-OH) sent a letter late last night to the Chairman and Ranking Member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee asking them to move a bill, under suspension of the rules, immediately to the House floor to extend The Qualified Individual (QI-1) program under Medicare Part B. QI-1 is set to expire on Friday if Congress does not act. 
<BR>
<BR>The Qualified Individual (QI-1) program pays the monthly Medicare part B premium for beneficiaries with incomes between 120% and 135% of federal poverty level that are not otherwise eligible for Medicaid.  If QI-1 expires, over 160,000 low-income seniors and those with disabilities will lose this crucial assistance on which they rely to cover their health care costs.  
<BR>
<BR>In their letter, the group asked that H.R. 3800, the Kucinich-LaTourette bill, be moved immediately onto the suspension calendar. HR 3800 reauthorizes QI-1 for one year, as was done on a bipartisan basis last year.  Last year, it passed the Senate without amendment and passed the House by a voice vote.
<BR>
<BR>In the letter the group states that seniors, “deserve better than to lose the benefit when the issue enjoys strong bipartisan support.”
<BR>
<BR>
Joining Kucinich and LaTourette on the letter were Congressman John Conyers and Congressman John McHugh.
