<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- March 16 -- Today, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) sued the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) in the District Court for the District of Columbia for failing to produce documents pursuant to a Freedom of Information Act Request (FOIA). CREW had asked the USDA to produce any records relating to contracts the USDA may have entered into with any public relations firms.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CREW filed a FOIA with the USDA on January 11, 2005 after learning that the Department of Education had paid pundit Armstrong Williams to promote the No Child Left Behind Act. The Freedom of Information Act requires federal agencies to respond to FOIA requests within 20 days, but in violation of the law, the USDA failed to respond to CREW's request.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Melanie Sloan, CREW's executive director, said &quot;we know through published reports that the USDA routinely uses video news releases to promote its agenda and to tout the administration's record on agricultural issues. Questions remain, however, regarding how much of our taxpayer dollars the USDA is spending on public relations, which public relations firms are involved, and what the USDA is requiring in its contracts with public relations firms. This is what we first tried to learn by filing the FOIA request and what we continue to seek through this lawsuit.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A copy of CREW's complaint can be found on the web at <a href="http://www.citizensforethics.org/" target="_new">http://www.citizensforethics.org</a> or by contacting Naomi Seligman at 202-588-5565 or <a href="mailto:press@citizensforethics.org" target="_new">press@citizensforethics.org</a></font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) is a non-profit, progressive legal watchdog group dedicated to holding public officials accountable for their actions.</i></font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
