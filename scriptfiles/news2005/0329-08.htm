<p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- March 29 -- The consumer advocacy group Public Citizen has called on the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (<a href="http://www.nrc.gov/" target="_new">NRC</a>) to withdraw a proposed rule that would unduly and perhaps illegally broaden the scope of nuclear industry security information that would be restricted from public access.  The group made the assertion in<a href="http://www.citizen.org/documents/sgicomments.pdf" target="_new"> formal comments</a> submitted this week to the NRC on the agency&#146;s proposed rule to revise its regulations governing the protection of so-called &#147;Safeguards Information,&#148; access to which is restricted to people who have undergone extensive background checks and demonstrated a &#147;need to know&#148; the information.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;If instituted, these new regulations would further compromise the public&#146;s ability to hold the nuclear industry and its government regulators accountable for their management of nuclear facilities and materials,&#148; said Wenonah Hauter, director of Public Citizen&#146;s Critical Mass Energy and Environment Program.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The proposed regulations go beyond the &#147;minimum restrictions needed to protect the health and safety of the public or the common defense and security,&#148; as required by the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, the law that established the Safeguards category, Public Citizen said in its comments.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;Rather than applying the &#145;minimum restrictions needed&#146; requirement, the commission is attempting to expand the category of Safeguards Information to encompass virtually anything it wants&#151;including information important to the public such as engineering and safety analyses, emergency planning procedures and inspection reports on nuclear facilities,&#148; Hauter said.  &#147;This is an unacceptable information blackout that will leave the public in the dark about the competency of the nuclear industry and the NRC.&#148;</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The group also charged that the NRC&#146;s proposed rule would improperly restrict the public&#146;s access to important information that has proved useful in the past.  For example, using information obtained from the NRC about nuclear facilities&#146; security capabilities, citizen groups in the early 1990s successfully pressured the agency to adopt higher standards for the protection of nuclear facilities, incorporating the possibility of adversaries using truck bombs.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The proposed rule comes at a time when the NRC is under fire for its allegedly improper use of the Safeguards classification to conceal industry vulnerabilities.  <a href="http://www.house.gov/markey/index.htm" target="_new">U.S. Rep. Edward Markey</a> (D-Mass.) recently said in a letter to the NRC&#146;s inspector general that the suppression of a National Academy of Sciences (NAS) study about the security vulnerabilities of the pools in which reactor operators store irradiated nuclear fuel may be &#147;based on the fact that it disagrees with the NAS&#146; conclusions, not on any legitimate security concerns.&#148;</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The NRC also has been criticized recently&#151;by Markey, Public Citizen and others&#151;for its decision to bar public access to its online document library for several months while it conducted a security review &#147;to ensure that documents which might provide assistance to terrorists will be inaccessible.&#148;  Despite this restricted access, the NRC did not suspend its licensing or rulemaking proceedings, compromising the participation of stakeholders who needed access to the NRC&#146;s documents. While most of the documents are back up on the Web, some have been redacted.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Public Citizen further noted in its comments that the Safeguards category is not subject to the protections from institutional abuse as is National Security Information, a government-wide category. The public may challenge perceived instances of abuse or excessive secrecy surrounding information in this category.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;This proposal gives the NRC and its licensees free rein to make secret virtually any information even tangentially related to the security of nuclear facilities,&#148; said Joseph Malherek, policy analyst for Public Citizen and principal author of the comments.  &#147;The NRC should withdraw this regressive proposal and instead establish responsible reforms to its rules for the protection of Safeguards Information.&#148;</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To read Public Citizen&#146;s comments, click<a href="http://www.citizen.org/documents/sgicomments.pdf" target="_new"> here</a>.</font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
