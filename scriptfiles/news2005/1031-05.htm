<p>WASHINGTON - October 31 - Citing a history of written opinions that consistently side with powerful special interests against ordinary Americans, MoveOn.org Political Action today opposed President Bush’s nomination of Appellate Judge Samuel Alito to the US Supreme Court.

 

<p>MoveOn will mobilize its 3.3 million members in a campaign to urge Senators to oppose his confirmation. 

 

<p>“By nominating someone who regularly sides with big corporations against the rights of ordinary Americans, the President chose a man who passes all of the right-wing litmus tests,” said Ben Brandzel, Advocacy Director of MoveOn.org Political Action. 

 

<p>“Many of Alito’s opinions as an Appellate Judge were so extreme that he was reversed and rebuked by his colleagues. But on the Supreme Court, joining with fellow extreme right-wingers, Scalia and Thomas, he could do real damage,” Brandzel added.

 

<p>Among Alito’s opinions to which MoveOn objects are the following:

 

<p>
<ul>
<li>Against workers’ rights under the Family and Medical Leave Act;</li>
<li>Against workers rights to oppose employment discrimination; </li>
<li>Against the rights of people with disabilities; </li>
<li>Against women’s rights including reproductive choice;</li>
<li>Allows unauthorized, unreasonable and invasive searches. </li>
</ul>
