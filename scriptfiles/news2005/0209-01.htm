<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- February 9 -- Survey results from U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service biologists, ecologists, botanists and other science professionals from across the country will be released this Wednesday, February 9 at 1:00 p.m. EST. The 42-question survey, distributed by <a href="http://www.ucsusa.org" target="_new">Union of Concerned Scientists</a> (UCS) and <a href="http://www.peer.org/404.html" target="_new">Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility</a> (PEER) to more than 1,400 FWS scientists, focuses on employee perceptions about scientific integrity within the agency, as well as political interference, resources and morale. Despite agency directives prohibiting employees from responding to the survey even on their own time, nearly one-third of the surveys were returned, with the majority including written descriptions of their concerns. 

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Results will be released Wednesday, February 9, at 1:00 p.m. EST.
