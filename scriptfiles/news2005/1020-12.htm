<p>WASHINGTON - October 20 - On Friday, October  21st, The Interfaith Alliance will lead a diverse group of  religious leaders representing America's wide spectrum of faiths  on an investigative tour of the Katrina relief efforts in Baton  Rouge, Louisiana. Following the tour, members of the delegation - - Christian, Jewish, Sikh, Buddhist, and other religious and  community leaders -- will bear witness, calling on policy makers  to respond more effectively and committing their own  organizations and denominations to provide additional resources  to directly help the evacuees, now and in the months and years  ahead.</p>
<p>   The delegation of 30-plus members will also focus their  attention on attacks to religious liberties that have occurred,  and the ongoing threats to American's religious liberties posed  by various policies implemented and being considered, in the wake  of the hurricanes.</p>
<p>   "The Interfaith Alliance and members of the Interfaith  Delegation applaud the vital, compassionate job that religious  and secular social service programs are doing to help the  evacuees," said the Rev. Dr. C. Welton Gaddy, president of The  Interfaith Alliance. "We also want to alert Americans to the  dangers inherent in the Bush administration's manipulation of the  Katrina aftermath as it seeks to circumvent the U. S.  Constitution with government funding of religion, including  reimbursing houses of worship for disaster relief and using  public funds to rebuild parochial schools and other religious  institutions as announced by the White House Tuesday.</p>
<p>   "We have an abiding interest in assuring that help is being  offered and money is being spent in a manner that does not  violate people's basic civil rights and fundamental religious  freedom," Gaddy said.</p>
<p>   The delegation will also provide immediate resources,  including guides produced by the Lawyers Committee for Civil  Rights Under Law to help those in need to know their rights.  Baton Rouge Mayor Melvin "Kip" Holden and many local religious  leaders will participate and facilitate the tour.</p>
<p>   The Interfaith Delegation will visit a disaster recovery  center, a shelter and a trailer park housing evacuees. After  these stops, the delegation will go to Nazarene Baptist Church in  Baton Rouge and hold a public forum to find out more from the  community.</p>
