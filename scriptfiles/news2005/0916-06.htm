<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->The Iraqi Red Crescent Society (IRCS) estimates at around 5,000 the number of families from Tal-Afar in northern Iraq that have had to flee their homes and take refuge in surrounding towns and villages following the escalation of violence in the city. While some are staying with friends or relatives, others are living in abandoned villages or small camps, with no access to such basic items as food, water or bedding. The IRCS has set up camps around Tal-Afar to host displaced families. 

<p>The ICRC has supplied the IRCS’s Mosul branch with 5,000 individual food baskets, 1,000 jerrycans, 1,000 buckets, 1,000 blankets, 100 tents, 600 kerosene stoves and 600 hygiene kits. In addition, the ICRC has supplied 50 stretchers to the IRCS and 50 to the Directorate of Health. 

<p>Since the start of the military operation in Tal-Afar in July, the ICRC has been providing 900 families with 180,000 litres of drinking water a day. 

<p>The ICRC is endeavouring to respond to the urgent humanitarian needs of people affected by the hostilities in Iraq, working in close collaboration with the Iraqi Red Crescent Society. It calls on all those involved in the fighting to respect the basic rules of international humanitarian law that are applicable in Iraq. This includes taking every feasible precaution to spare civilians and to ensure that the principles of distinction and proportionality are respected in all military operations.
