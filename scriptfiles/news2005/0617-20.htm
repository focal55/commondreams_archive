<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">PHILADELPHIA, PA — From June 17-21 people from across the country and  
overseas will converge on Philadelphia to show their opposition to  
health care profiteering, bio-weapons proliferation, and poorly tested,  
unlabeled genetically engineered food. This gathering, Biodemocracy  
2005, will coincide with the annual meeting of the Biotechnology  
Industry Organization (BIO).

</font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">BIO is the largest biotechnology lobbying group, representing an  
industry that lost $6.4 billion last year ($45 billion over its  
lifetime), and is expected to sustain losses for a number of years,  
according to a recently published Ernst & Young report. Brian Tokar,  
the director of the Biotechnology Project at the Institute for Social  
Ecology, points out, “The BIO convention is not a scientific  
meeting. It’s a convention of business executives, investors, lawyers,  
and public relations officials. In past years, less than 10% of  
registrants have been scientists.”

</font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Many of the researchers who develop the innovations embraced by BIO are  
highly critical of the industry’s avarice. Dr. Randy Zauhar, a  
presenter at the BIO convention who will also be a panelist during the  
Biodemocracy Teach-in this coming weekend points out, “Biotech  
companies carry out research not to protect human health and welfare,  
but to maximize profits. Scientists have a moral responsibility, as  
much as physicians, to apply their training to benefit society, and to  
be cognizant of the political and economic consequences of their  
actions.”

</font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Biodemocracy 2005, which is primarily locally organized, will bring in  
experts from the US, Canada, the UK, Argentina and elsewhere to  
articulate a critique of biotechnology and celebrate healthy  
alternatives. Scheduled events include a festival of alternatives and  
children’s fair, a comprehensive 3 day counter-conference, and a  
variety of colorful and inspired actions aimed to highlight critical  
issues, as well as the organizers’ vision for a healthier and more  
secure future.Nelson Carrasquillo, of the New Jersey-based Comité de  
Apoyo de Trabajadores Agriculturas (Farmworker Support Committee),  
remarks, “If we truly want to feed the people of our country and our  
world with wholesome food, we have to abandon the false promises of  
genetic engineering and corporate-run agriculture.”

</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Organizers of Biodemocracy 2005 are also seeking to highlight the  
harmful impact of biological weapons research and biowarfare. “Under  
the pretext of protecting the public, big business and government are  
developing a new generation of biological weapons of mass destruction”. The U.S. government is currently pouring more money into  
“biodefense” than was spent on the Manhattan Project, which developed  
the first atom bomb. Dr. Richard Ebright, Laboratory Director at  
Rutgers University’s Wakman Institute counters, “There is no threat of  
... development of next generation Biosafety Level 4 agents [e.g.,  
anthrax, ebola, plague] by a sub-state adversary—a terrorist  
organization. We are conducting an arms race against ourselves.”

</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">With eighty percent of the world’s largest pharmaceutical companies  
located within a 50-mile radius of Philadelphia, the issue of health  
care and medical safety will be very prominent at BioDemocracy 2005.  
The resistance by BIO convention sponsor Merck to withdrawing its  
harmful drug Vioxx shows how corporations put profits ahead of public  
health. Michael Susko, Director of Citizens for Responsible Care and  
Research (CIRCARE) explains, “Human research protection is at a  
crossroads. We are on the verge of realizing that there is a great  
problem in terms of public safety – especially the lack of adverse  
event reporting and follow up studies in the long term use of many  
medicines.” CIRCARE was founded by the father of Jesse Gelsinger, a  
youth who was killed in a notorious “gene therapy” experiment at the  
University it Pennsylvania. The researcher conducting the experiment  
turned out to be an officer of a biotech company established to profit  
from such research.

</font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The pharmaceutical industry is also often criticized for charging more  
than its customers can afford. In 2003, Philadelphia-based  
GlaxoSmithKline stopped shipping its prescription drugs to Canadian  
pharmacies that sell to U.S. customers, primarily seniors. Members of  
the Action Alliance of Senior Citizens will assemble Tuesday morning,  
June 21st at the headquarters of GlaxoSmithKline to protest this and  
other unfair practices of Glaxo. “The corporate sponsors of the BIO  
convention include many of the large pharmaceutical companies who are  
responsible for the high cost of prescription drugs at a time that many  
Americans cannot afford basic healthcare or medications. The  
pharmaceutical industry has vigorously opposed any rational health  
system reform because it would cut into their profit margins,” says Dr.  
Adam Tsai, of the Philadelphia chapter of Physicians for a National  
Health Program, who points out, “precisely because we all eat food and  
take medicine, we need to raise questions about biotechnology.”

</font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Biodemocracy events commence on Saturday morning at 10 AM with a  
Reclaim the Commons Festival at Clark Park in West Philadelphia,  
followed by 2 afternoons and evenings of panels, workshops and films at  
the Friends Center (1501 Cherry St.). The educational program resumes  
at the Ethical Society Building (So. Rittenhouse Square, off 19th St.)  
on Monday, June 20th. Tuesday will be a day of rallies, parades and  
direct action highlighting the issues of genetically engineered  
agriculture, healthcare and the pharmaceutical industry, and the  
dangers of bioweapons development.</font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Web links:  <a href="http://www.biodev.org/" target="_new">www.biodev.org</a>, <a href="http://www.reclaimthecommons.net/" target="_new">www.reclaimthecommons.net</a>
