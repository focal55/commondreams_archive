<p align="left">NEW YORK - September 29 - The non-profit Clean  Air Watch today warned that energy legislation approved early  this morning by a House of Representatives committee &quot;would be  the biggest weakening of the Clean Air Act in history.&quot;</p>
<p>   Just after midnight, following a largely partisan debate, the  House Energy and Commerce Committee approved legislation  allegedly designed to increase the capacity of oil refineries in  the wake of recent hurricanes. </p>
<p>   But Frank O'Donnell, president of Clean Air Watch, noted the  legislation includes many provisions that have no connection at  all to gas prices.  The bill, slated to come before the full  House of Representatives next week, would &quot;blow gaping loopholes  in the Clean Air Act,&quot; O'Donnell noted.</p>
<p>   Committee Chairman Joe Barton (R-TX) noted he took the unusual  step of holding a marathon bill-writing session without a prior  hearing because he was prodded by the House Republican leadership  to bypass normal procedures. The leadership -- roiled yesterday  by the indictment of Rep. Tom DeLay (R-Texas) -- reportedly has  been concerned about public anger over high gasoline prices.  </p>
<p>   &quot;Unfortunately, this appears to be a cynical attempt to  exploit the recent hurricanes for political gain -- and the gain  of well-connected special-interest polluters,&quot; O'Donnell said.   &quot;This would be the biggest weakening of the Clean Air Act in  history.  It will merely exacerbate human suffering.&quot; </p>
<p>   O'Donnell pointed, for example, to a provision that would  &quot;eviscerate&quot; a key enforcement tool in the law known as new  source review.  This tool, which has been used many times to  reduce pollution from refineries, coal-fired electric power  plants and other smokestack industries, has long been unpopular  with big polluters.  The dirty-air provision, sponsored by  Barton, would permit thousands of smokestack industries -- not  just refineries -- to increase real-world emissions. </p>
<p>   Barton noted yesterday that he included the provision at the  specific request of the Bush administration -- a startling  revelation since the administration's Justice Department has  advocated the use of this pollution cleanup tool in pending  enforcement cases against big power companies.  (In response to  industry lobbying, the Bush administration separately has tried  to weaken this tool through regulations, but its efforts have  been stymied by a federal court.) </p>
<p>   &quot;Gutting this part of the law would undermine the Justice  Department enforcement cases and open the door to increased  pollution,&quot; O'Donnell noted.  &quot;There is an appearance here of a  political payback to special interests including the oil and  electric power industries.&quot; </p>
<p>   The controversial legislation also includes a Barton-sought  provision that would encourage the EPA to postpone smog cleanup  requirements in many communities afflicted by pollution from  upwind areas.  A Barton staffer admitted during the deliberations  that this provision -- like the new source review  provision -- had no direct relation to energy industry needs  following the recent hurricanes.  </p>
<p>   In addition, the legislation would take away state and local  authority regarding refinery permits and would impede efforts to  require cleaner fuels.
