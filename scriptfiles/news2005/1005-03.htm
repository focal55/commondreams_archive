<p>WASHINGTON - Under the Bush administration, the U.S. Environmental 
Protection Agency is increasingly relying on corporate joint ventures in its 
research program, according to agency documents released today by Public 
Employees for Environmental Responsibility (PEER). This trend, says agency 
scientists, means that EPA is diverting funds from basic public health and 
environmental research toward applied research to address regulatory concerns of 
corporate funders.</P>
<P>Records obtained by PEER under the Freedom of Information Act show a marked 
increase in &#8220;cooperative research and development agreements&#8221; (or CRADAs) with 
individual corporations or industry associations since the advent of the Bush 
Administration. During the first Bush term EPA entered into 57 corporate CRADAs, 
compared with 34 such agreements in during Clinton&#8217;s second term. The American 
Chemical Council (ACC) is now EPA&#8217;s leading research partner.</P>
<P>A classic example of recent EPA/corporate joint ventures is the 2004 
agreement reached with the ACC to fund the now-canceled CHEERS experiment in 
which parents would have received payments and gifts in return for spraying 
pesticides and other chemicals in the rooms primarily occupied by their infant 
children.</P>
<P>&#8220;Under its current leadership, EPA is becoming an arm of corporate R &amp; 
D,&#8221; stated PEER Program Director Rebecca Roose, noting that the number of 
corporate CRADAs under Bush outnumber those entered into with universities or 
local governments. &#8220;Public health research needs should not have to depend upon 
corporate underwriting.&#8221;</P>
<P>In internal agency surveys, EPA scientists maintain that corporations are 
influencing the agency&#8217;s research agenda through financial inducements. As one 
EPA scientist wrote, &#8220;Many of us in the labs feel like we work for 
contracts.&#8221;</P>
<P>The rapid growth in corporate research joint ventures occurs against the 
backdrop of two recent reports raising related concerns about growing corporate 
involvement in EPA&#8217;s research:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>In a draft report this April, EPA&#8217;s Science Advisory Board warns that the 
  agency is no longer funding a credible public health research program. For 
  example, EPA is falling behind on emerging issues such as intercontinental 
  pollution transport and nanotechnology; and </LI></UL>
<UL>
  <LI>A Government Accountability Office study also released in April concluded 
  that EPA lacks safeguards to &#8220;evaluate or manage potential conflicts of 
  interest&#8221; in corporate research agreements. </LI></UL>
<P>EPA&#8217;s top research slot is currently vacant. The Bush nominee, George Gray, 
runs a university &#8220;Center for Risk Analysis&#8221; that relies almost entirely upon 
corporate grants.</P>
