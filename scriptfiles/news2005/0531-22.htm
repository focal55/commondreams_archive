<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"In his Rose Garden speech today, President Bush offered up the same polluting trade and energy policies that he has been pushing since the beginning of his administration.  Instead of moving America towards a cleaner and safer future, the Bush administration is again failing to offer us real solutions to create jobs, lower prices, and protect the health of our families and communities.

</font><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"We should not enter into trade agreements that put our communities at risk by limiting our government's authority to protect public health and the environment.  CAFTA threatens the health of our families and communities by allowing foreign corporations the right to challenge environmental and public health protections in secret trade tribunals.  The American people want trade that is safe, clean and fair. We can get this by making sure that environmental and public health standards can not be challenged by corporations, and that the environmental provisions in trade agreements are strong and enforceable.

</font><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"America deserves an energy policy that puts innovation to work, not a rehashed version of the same energy bill that the Bush administration hatched in back room meetings with energy industry executives five years ago.  By investing in real energy solutions, like renewable energy, energy efficiency, and fuel-efficient technology like hybrid cars, we can protect the environment, create new jobs, lower consumer energy bills, and cut America's dangerous dependence on oil.  It's time for President Bush to start listening to his own Department of Energy which has stated that the energy bill currently being debated in Congress would do nothing to lower energy prices or solve our other pressing energy problems.

</font><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"We have the solutions. We need leaders who will put American families ahead of giant corporations and act now to create a legacy that we will be proud to leave our children.
