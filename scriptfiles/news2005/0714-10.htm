<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">NEW YORK - July 14 - Attorneys with the New York-based Center for Constitutional Rights (CCR), today criticized Department of Defense testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee. The testimony confirmed the Administration's continuing refusal to hold military decision-makers accountable for prisoner abuse at Guant&aacute;namo and elsewhere.  Despite formal objections by experienced FBI investigators who witnessed widespread abuse at Guant&aacute;namo in connection with interrogations, DoD officials continue to deny involvement.</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Interviews with detainees imprisoned by the U.S. military in Guant&aacute;namo, Iraq, and Afghanistan, establish without question that the United States has engaged in a policy of abusive detentions and interrogations that must be remedied.  Interviews of Guant&aacute;namo prisoners revealed:</font></p><p> </p><ul><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Canadian O.K., a juvenile who was approximately 15 years old when he was taken into custody by U.S. forces in 2001, was threatened by interrogators who, on several occasions, told O.K. he would be sent to Egypt, Israel, Jordan, or Syria-to be tortured.  Interrogators also told the 15-year old O.K. that Egyptians would send &quot;Soldier No. 9&quot; to rape him.  On one occasion, O.K. was short shackled in various painful positions over an extended period of time; he urinated on himself.  Military Police (MP) poured pine oil on the floor and dragged O.K.-still shackled-on his stomach through the mixture.<br><br></font></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Before he was taken to Guant&aacute;namo, German resident Murat Kurnaz was tortured by U.S. forces in Afghanistan who applied electric shocks to his feet, hung him by his hands for days at a time, and repeatedly subjected him to waterboarding.  Mr. Kurnaz witnessed the brutal beating by soldiers of another prisoner who was left bleeding severely from his head wounds.  Mr. Kurnaz believes the prisoner died as a result of the beating.<br><br> </font></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When Bosnian Lakhdar Boumediene went on a hunger strike to protest his brutal treatment, a nurse administering intravenous (IV) fluid to him threatened to have a soldier administer the IV the next day if Mr. Boumediene did not eat.  The following day, she made good on her threat, and a soldier was directed to administer the IV.  Mr. Boumediene's arm was in extreme pain and bleeding as the soldier attempted to administer the IV.  On another occasion, interrogators threatened to shave Mr. Boumediene and apply lipstick to him to make him look like a woman.<br><br> </font></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Abd Al Malik Al Wahab of Yemen was told by interrogators that he would be taken &quot;underground&quot; and never again allowed to see the sun; that if taken to the U.S. he would be &quot;put . . . in a jail with all blacks&quot; who &quot;will do whatever they please to you&quot; and &quot;nobody will help you&quot;; that he would be taken to &quot;Egypt and Jordan, and they will torture you&quot;; and that he would be raped by a male at Guant&aacute;namo.  Interrogators also threatened Mr. Al Wahab's family, telling him the military could &quot;reach them if it wanted.&quot;<br><br> </font></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On approximately April 27 or 28, 2002, Juma Al Dossari was choked and beaten in his cell by MPs and lost consciousness.  He was carried from his bloodied cell on a stretcher.  The military videotaped the incident.  When Mr. Al Dossari later asked the MP who had beaten him why he had done so, the MP replied, &quot;because I'm a Christian.&quot;<br> </font></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">During an interrogation of Abdullah Al Noaimi, Mr. Al Noaimi was injected with an unknown substance that caused him to lose the ability to control his thoughts.  Interrogators then asked if he wanted to hurt himself, and if he wanted to be shot.<br><br> </font></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Guant&aacute;namo prisoners routinely have been subject to beatings, extreme sleep deprivation, humiliation, short shackling, intimidation by dogs, extended periods of solitary confinement, withholding of medical care, and temperature extremes in connection with interrogation.<br><br></font></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As confirmed in findings released yesterday in the Schmidt Report, military officials impersonated FBI agents and State Department officials. Prisoners also have reported that interrogators impersonated lawyers, in an effort to gain information.<br> </font></li></ul><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CCR President Michael Ratner stated, &quot;Such denials have damaged the standing of the United States and placed our soldiers at risk abroad.  The Senate Armed Services Committee must establish an independent investigation to reestablish the integrity of the U.S. military and restore the standing of the United States in the international community.  When our military ignores the concerns of even the FBI, we are left with no choice but an independent investigation.&quot;</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CCR Deputy Legal Director Barbara Olshansky stated, &quot;These widespread practices in U.S. detention facilities throughout the world are not the acts of rogue soldiers.  At best, the military is simply incapable of self-policing; at worst, our military's leadership is engaging in a deceptive cover-up to avoid command responsibility.  The American public cannot tolerate either.&quot; </font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Muneer Ahmad, CCR Cooperating Counsel from American University, stated, &quot;When I learned about the abuse, and saw the conditions at Guant&aacute;namo, I realized that our military is engaging in a gross deception.  The young man I represent who was only 15 when he was taken into U.S. custody is being held indefinitely under circumstances that have caused severe psychological damage.  All of this has occurred outside the bounds of existing military law. Our government must get to the truth of what is happening in Guant&aacute;namo-we need an immediate independent investigation of the facts.&quot;</font></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p align="CENTER"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">###</font></p><!-- #EndEditable -->
