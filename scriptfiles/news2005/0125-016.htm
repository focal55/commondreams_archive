With them, teens are ask to carefully view beer ads during the Feb. 6 game, and write  down which elements are appealing and persuasive. The next day, dubbed,  &quot;Media Literacy Monday&quot; by ACME, classes will discuss their reactions  and findings.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Media Literacy Monday&quot; includes background information, charts, follow-up questions and answers -- all the tools necessary to turn the big game into a provocative media-literacy experience.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;If students don't receive this information, not only do they know less about the world's most powerful medium -- TV ads, but we allow the beer companies to have a near-monopoly on the socialization of our children,&quot; says Rob Williams, a Burlington, Vt., college professor who is ACME's president.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A single, 30-second beer ad during the Super Bowl will cost $2.4 million, according to University of New Mexico Medical School pediatrician Victor Strasburger, an ACME advisor and expert on adolescent drugs, alcohol and the media. &quot;Every year, the alcohol industry spends $5.7 billion to get kids to 'just say yes' to drinking, using sophomoric, misogynistic humor, cute animals -- whatever works. Its a form of electronic child abuse,&quot; he says.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>About ACME<br></i></font><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ACME is a member-supported, independent, nonprofit organization based in Albuquerque, N.M.
