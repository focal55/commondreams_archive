<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- February 1 -- House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi released the following statement today in honor of Black History Month:</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Today marks the beginning of Black History Month. While one month does not do justice to honor the rich history of a community that has overcome so much, Black History Month is an opportunity for all Americans to pay tribute to the significant and long-lasting contributions that African Americans have made to the nation's economic, cultural, spiritual, and political fabric.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;From Frederick Douglass to Fannie Lou Hammer to the 43 men and women of the Congressional Black Caucus that I have the honor and pleasure of serving with in the 109th Congress, African Americans represent every aspect of this great nation's heritage and hope.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;This year's theme for Black History Month is the 100th Anniversary of the Niagara Movement. In 1905, a group of 29 courageous African American leaders and thinkers - led by sociologist and scholar W.E.B. Du Bois - met to develop a plan for aggressive action and demanded: suffrage, equal economic and educational opportunities, an end to segregation and full civil rights. The meeting, held in secret near Niagara Falls, was a call to let loose a 'mighty current' of protest against the injustices facing the African American community.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Because of the vision of Du Bois, the Niagara Movement, and countless other civil rights trailblazers African Americans have overcome astonishing hardships and inequalities. Today, more African American families have joined the middle class, more African American young people are pursuing higher education and the number of black businesses is increasing. But, there is still much more work to be done to expand opportunity and equality to all Americans.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;House Democrats are committed to fighting for civil, social, and economic justice. To that end, we have put forward our New Partnership for America's Future, which reaffirms our dedication to six core American values: national security, prosperity, opportunity, fairness, community, and accountability.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;As we celebrate Black History Month, let us do so in the spirit of the Niagara Movement and recommit ourselves to standing for a proactive uncompromising agenda that achieves equality and opportunity for all Americans to reach their God-given potential.&quot;</font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
