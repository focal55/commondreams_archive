<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON / DARFUR - July 26 - A recent study conducted in South Darfur by Dr. Lynn Lawry (formerly Amowitz), Director of Evidence-Based Research for International Medical Corps (IMC), warns that while some of the displaced population’s basic needs are being met by humanitarian organizations, significant gaps persist in general health services, mental health, and women’s health needs.

<p></p>The current international aid response is not fully meeting these needs. The study calls for immediate steps to be taken to address the poor state of mental and women’s health.
<p></p>Approximately 2.3 million people in Darfur rely on aid to survive. United Nations officials have called this the worst humanitarian crisis in the world. Insecurity for aid workers and poor infrastructure continues to hinder relief efforts, particularly in South Darfur. Although health assessments of internally displaced persons (IDPs) in Darfur have been previously reported, mental health and women’s health burdens in this population remained largely unknown.
<p></p>To assess these needs, IMC surveyed a random sample of 1,293 displaced women living in camps in Nyala district, South Darfur. The results represent over 220,000 IDPs in Nyala and revealed the significant unmet women’s and mental health burden among these people. 
<p></p>Urgent women’s health needs 
<p></p>Women make up the majority of refugee and IDP populations. This study reflects a poor state of reproductive health among IDP women in South Darfur. Family planning and provisions for safe motherhood (prenatal, delivery, and postpartum care) are inadequate. Overall, 12% of respondents (152/1253) were pregnant at the time of the study. The average number of pregnancies was 6 ± 0.09 (range 0-20) while the average number of pregnancies receiving pre-natal care was 1.4 ± 0.06. 
<p></p>Thirty percent of respondents (380/1,262) were breastfeeding at the time of the study and 50% (177/353) of these reported difficulties or an inability to breastfeed. Fifty-six percent of respondents (709/1,274) reported gynaecological symptoms and 67% of respondents (853/1,269) reported they must ask permission of a family member to access health care all or most of the time.
<p></p>The findings also indicate limited sexual and reproductive rights including rights to marriage, spacing and timing of children, movement, education, consensual sex, unattended deliveries or attendance with untrained birth attendants, and access to health care. This may negatively impact health and the already high maternal mortality rate.
<p></p>Depression and suicide
<p></p>The prevalence of depression and suicide rates presents a considerable challenge for humanitarian agencies in Sudan. This reflects a more general need to address mental health needs in populations affected by conflict as the priority is usually given to physical health. Nearly a third of women interviewed (31%, 390/1,253) met criteria for Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and another 63% of women reported symptoms of depression including feeling down, depressed, and hopeless. Suicide attempts among women and household suicide prevalence were alarmingly high in contrast to general rates worldwide. Over the prior year, 5% of respondents reported suicidal ideation (66/1,257) and 2% reported personal suicide attempts (28/1,260). Two percent of households had a household member that committed suicide during the prior year (21/1,124).
<p></p>Historically, provisions for mental health programs in Sudan have been minimal. To IMC’s knowledge, there are no mental health services available for IDPs beyond services provided by a few non-governmental organizations. 
<p></p>“Women make up the majority of refugees and their needs cannot be neglected. These women are not just helpless victims, they are resilient and determined to cope and adjust to their situation. Mental health is important in building this coping ability. We as an aid community must address these unmet needs,” Lawry said.
<p></p>Call to Action
<p></p>The study proposed the following steps to address some of the unmet needs: 
<p></p>Increasing culturally appropriate mental health support
Further mental health assessments and multidisciplinary programs are needed. It is noteworthy that 98% (381/390) of women meeting criteria for MDD felt that counseling facilitated by international agencies might be helpful. To effectively promote women’s mental health in Sudan, gender- and rights-based models (i.e. provision basic needs) including health needs will be necessary.
<p></p>Reducing deaths from maternal and neonatal tetanus
Tetanus toxoid immunizations for women of child-bearing age are a fundamental component of antenatal care for pregnant mothers to prevent maternal and neonatal tetanus. Given limited antenatal services and lack of skilled traditional birth attendants (TBAs) in this population, a high-risk strategy (vaccination of at least 90% of all women of child-bearing age with three, properly spaced, doses of tetanus toxoid) may be necessary per UNICEF, WHO and UNFPA recommendations. It is also essential to train TBAs or midwives to address the most common causes of maternal death such as hemorrhage and to make appropriate referrals to health facilities that can care for women with complications of pregnancy.
<p></p>Addressing breastfeeding difficulties
Nearly half of women surveyed reported difficulties breastfeeding, which emphasizes the need for infant feeding counseling and education programs. Displaced women in emergency situations are at increased risk of breastfeeding problems. In emergency settings, breast milk is a hygienic, economical food source that is important for conferral of immunity, nutrition, fertility regulation, and psychological well being of mother and child. It is an essential preventive measure against diarrhoeal diseases.
<p></p>Reducing the risk of sexual violence
Given the predominance of women and children foragers found in this study, and the reports of sexual violence in Darfur, particularly among women and girls foraging for wood beyond camp borders, there is a need to find alternative provisions for assuring fuel for households in IDP camps.

<p></p>Managing the health consequences of female circumcision
The 84% prevalence of female circumcision was consistent with previous estimates of 89% in Sudan. Health consequences include hemorrhage and infection, urologic and sexual dysfunction, difficulties with childbirth, and psychological complications. A predominance of infibulation (an extreme type of female genital mutilation) has been reported in Sudan and surgical defibulation may be necessary for safe deliveries. The high prevalence of this traditional practice emphasizes the need for national policies, culturally-sensitive educational programs, and appropriate health care including obstetric and gynaecological services. 
Background
<p></p>The crisis in Darfur has displaced over 200,000 refugees into Chad and 1.85 million people within the greater Darfur region. Up to 3 million could be displaced in Darfur by the end of the year. The death toll from disease and violence is unknown with estimates ranging from 180,000-300,000. 
<p></p>In Chad and Darfur, IMC is supporting the needs of more than 250,000 people who have been affected by the ongoing violence through emergency medical assistance, primary health care with a focus on maternal and child health, nutritional screening for children 0-5 years of age, health education and hygiene promotion and immunizations and mental health programs. In addition, IMC is recruiting and training volunteer community health workers from within the camps to provide health education, identify community members who are in need of treatment and encourage pregnant women to access antenatal care.
