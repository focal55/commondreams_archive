<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">NEW YORK, NY -- January 24 -- The first Hispanic Air National Guard officer appointed as an adjutant general in the United States and two Hispanic Stanford Law School professors joined Human Rights First in announcing today that they are formally opposing the nomination of Alberto Gonzales to be Attorney General of the United States. The announcement comes just two days before the Senate Judiciary Committee is expected to vote on Gonzales' nomination.</font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Opposition to a presidential nominee is a rare step for our organization - a step we have only taken once before in our 27- year history,&quot; said Michael Posner, Executive Director of Human Rights First (formerly the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights). &quot;Mr. Gonzales is a talented and experienced lawyer. He has an inspiring personal history. But Mr. Gonzales helped to open the door to abuses that have undermined discipline in the military, put American fighting men and women at greater risk, and denied the United States the moral high ground.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Posner added that a matter of particular concern is Gonzales' advocacy of the position that the President has power as Commander-in-Chief to ignore laws passed by Congress.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Disputes about the constitutionality of laws and treaties of the United States are matters for the courts to decide,&quot; Posner added. &quot;The U.S. Constitution ensures that no one, even the President during wartime, is above the law. That is an important reason why we are urging the Senate to reject Gonzales' nomination.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Hispanic military and legal leaders also announced their opposition, urging Senators to not fall prey to concerns about being labeled anti-Hispanic.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Like Judge Gonzales, I know what it feels like to be the first Hispanic to be named to an important leadership position in this country,&quot; said Major General Melvyn Montano (Ret. USAF National Guard), a Vietnam veteran who served 45 years in the military, including 18 years in a command position. &quot;I welcome the prospect of more Hispanics serving in leadership positions in the government, and I respect Judge Gonzales' inspiring personal story. But given Gonzales' record, senators who are afraid to vote against his confirmation for fear of being labeled 'anti- Hispanic' are doing themselves and their constituents a grave disservice.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Mariano-Florentino Cuellar, an Associate Professor of Law and Deane F. Johnson Faculty Scholar at Stanford Law School and former a law clerk to Chief Judge Mary M. Schroeder, U. S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, agreed.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;As a Latino, I oppose double standards whether they benefit or hurt Latinos,&quot; said Cuillar. &quot;I reluctantly have to ask: if these abuses primarily victimized Latinos instead of non-Latinos, would Latino groups be so united in their support of the Gonzales nomination?&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Jenny S. Martinez, an Assistant Professor of Law at Stanford Law School and former law clerk to U.S. Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer, also announced her opposition.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We should not forget that Latinos' history in the U.S. shows the importance of fighting to ensure the rule of law is respected and honored,&quot; said Martinez. &quot;Already, harsh immigration laws enacted as anti-terrorism measures are being used against vulnerable immigrant communities with no connection to terrorism at all.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Human Rights First full statement will be available by 10am EST at: <a href="http://www.humanrightsfirst.org/" target="_new">http://www.humanrightsfirst.org</a>.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A new detailed analysis from Human Rights First of its opposition to Gonzales will be available by 10am EST at: <a href="http://www.humanrightsfirst.org/" target="_new">http://www.humanrightsfirst.org</a>.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Other NGOs that have formally opposed Gonzales to be attorney general include: Physicians for Human Rights, Global Rights (formerly the International Human Rights Law Group), the Robert F. Kennedy Memorial, the International League for Human Rights, the Open Society Institute, Veterans for Common Sense, Center for Constitutional Rights, Physicians for Human Rights, Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights, National Alliance for Human Rights, Mexican American Political Association, La Raza Centro Legal, The Plainfield Meeting of the Religious Society of Friends, MALDEF - The Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, National Lawyers Guild, and Society of American Law Teachers. In addition to Major General Montano, a group of other retired military leaders have announced their personal opposition to Gonzales. They include: General Joseph P. Hoar (Ret. USMC), Brigadier General James Cullen (Ret. USA), and Rear Admiral John D. Hutson (Ret. USN). These military leaders are part of a group of 12 retired admirals and generals who released a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee just before Gonzales' confirmation hearing on January 6 outlining their concerns about Gonzales. That letter is available at: <a href="http://www.humanrightsfirst.org/us_law/etn/gonzales/statements/%20gonz_military_010405.pdf" target="_new">http://www.humanrightsfirst.org/us_law/etn/gonzales/statements/ gonz_military_010405.pdf</a></font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Professors Cuellar and Martinez and nine other professors sent a letter to Senate Judiciary Committee detailing their concerns about Gonzales. The letter will be available by 10am EST at: <a href="http://www.humanrightsfirst.org/" target="_new">http://www.humanrightsfirst.org</a>.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The following newspapers have recently written editorials announcing their opposition to Gonzales' nomination, including The Albuquerque (NM) Tribune, Boston Globe, Los Angeles Times, The (Bergen County, NJ) Record, (Minneapolis) Star Tribune, The (Columbia, SC) State and The Washington Post.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>For the past quarter century, Human Rights First (the new name of Lawyers Committee for Human Rights) has worked in the United States and abroad to create a secure and humane world by advancing justice, human dignity and respect for the rule of law. We support human rights activists who fight for basic freedoms and peaceful change at the local level; protect refugees in flight from persecution and repression; help build a strong international system of justice and accountability; and make sure human rights laws and principles are enforced in the United States and abroad.</i></font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
