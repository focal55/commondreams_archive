Of that amount, $1,887 went to the military and defense, while $1,171 went to interest on the debt.  The breakdown also includes: $1,276 to health care; $231 to education; $216 to veterans' benefits; $135 to housing, and $25 to job training.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">    Close to one-third of Americans' income tax dollars is spent on national security.  This money is divided into military operations, homeland security and preventive measures such as diplomacy, peacekeeping and development aid.  Military operations received 91 percent of all national security tax dollars, while homeland security received five percent and preventive measures got three percent.</font></p><p align="LEFT">    <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;As the expanding military budget strips communities of vital support and the cost of war in Iraq continues to spiral upward, people deserve to ask whether this is how they want their tax dollars spent,&quot; said Greg Speeter, executive director of the National Priorities Project.  &quot;Their elected officials need to hear their answers.&quot;</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">    To find out the cost of war for each state, go to <a href="http://www.nationalpriorities.org/warstatecost" target="_new">www.nationalpriorities.org/warstatecost</a> or for hundreds of cities at <a href="http://www.nationalpriorities.org/warcitycost" target="_new">www.nationalpriorities.org/warcitycost</a>.
