<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - July 20  -     &quot;The vacancy left by the resignation of Justice O'Connor has come at a  pivotal moment for our courts and our country,&quot; says ADA National  Director Amy Isaacs. &quot;The delicate balance of the current court,  Justice O'Connor's often critical swing vote, and the Bush Administration's insistence on nominating a candidate, Judge John G. Roberts, who's views are not in the moderate mold of Justice O'Connor makes the careful investigative role of the Senate crucial,&quot; said Isaacs.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Many of Mr. Roberts' statements over the years have been troubling  and raise profoundly serious questions,&quot; added Isaacs. &quot;The Senate  must not become a rubber-stamp of approval but rather take its role in  the confirmation process seriously. ADA urges them to examine Mr.  Roberts positions and writings on key civil, human, workers', and  women's rights issues. A lifetime appointment, decades of progress and  the lives of many of our nation's most vulnerable citizens are at  stake.</font> </p><p></p><p align="CENTER">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
