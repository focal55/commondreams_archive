The bishops acknowledged that innocent people are being sentenced to death by a system that discriminates on the basis of where one lives, how good a lawyer one can afford and, all too often, the race and ethnicity of a crime victim. On behalf of our approximately 100 local, state, national and international affiliates, we pledge our support to help the bishops&#146; goal of a less violent world become a reality. &#147;We also are pleased to hear the new survey results showing that support for abolition among Catholics in the U.S. is rising. This confirms other surveys that show Americans increasingly favor alternatives to the death penalty, including programs to prevent crime, address the needs of crime victims and ensure better quality representation for those accused of a crime. Investing our precious resources in these goals will result in enhanced public safety and an America that meets her promise and potential </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">of  democratic values.&#148;</font></p><p align="LEFT"></p><p align="LEFT"><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The National Coalition to Abolish the Death Penalty was founded in 1976 and is the only fully-staffed national organization devoted specifically to abolishing the death penalty.
