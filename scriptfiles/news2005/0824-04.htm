<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->WASHINGTON - August 24 -   Call for Assasination of Democratically Electied Leader of Venezuela is Immoral, Illegal, and must be Investigated<br>
<BR>
Global Exchange strongly condemns 
the call of extremist right-wing televangelist and Bush supporter Pat Robertson 
for the assassination of democratically elected President Hugo Chávez of 
Venezuela. Global Exchange calls on Pat Robertson to immediately retract his 
outrageous statement. Pat Robertson, a candidate for the GOP´s Presidential 
nomination in 1992, along with the millions of supporters of his 700 Club, are a 
key constituency of the Republican Party. <BR>
&nbsp;<BR>
Global Exchange, an 
international human rights organization, also calls on President Bush, Secretary 
of State Condoleezza Rice, Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, Speaker of the 
House Dennis Hastert, and House Majority Leader Tom DeLay to condemn in the 
strongest terms possible these immoral statements of a leader of their political 
base, which make a mockery of Christianity and give lie to the Republican claims 
that they stand for the right to life. State Department spokesperson Sean 
McCormack today merely referred to Robertson&#8217;s statement as &#8220;inappropriate&#8221;. 
&#8220;Calling for terrorist homicide against a democratically elected president is 
not &#8220;inappropriate&#8221;; it is illegal, immoral, must be condemned in the strongest 
language possible, and must be investigated for potential violations of federal 
and international law,&#8221; said Deborah James, Global Economy Director of Global 
Exchange. <BR>
&nbsp;<BR>
Pat Robertson should be investigated and potentially 
prosecuted for calling for the murder of a democratically-elected head of state. 
Under Title 18 of US Code Section 1116, &#8220;whoever kills or attempts to kill a 
foreign official, official guest, or internationally protected person shall be 
punished as provided under sections 1111, 1112, and 1113 of this title.&#8221; Section 
878 of the same title makes it a crime to &#8220;knowingly and willingly 
<I>threaten</I>&#8221; to commit the above crime. (italics added) It is incumbent upon 
the executive to investigate, and potentially prosecute, this wrongdoing by Pat 
Robertson to the fullest extent of the law. <BR>
&nbsp;<BR>
The US government has 
been working to create a climate hostile to the democratically-elected 
government of Venezuela. It is unfortunate that Pat Robertson&#8217;s statements are 
consistent with the actions of the Bush administration. The Bush administration 
supported the 2002 coup against President Chávez, and has continued to fund coup 
leaders in their efforts to remove President Chávez from office, even after the 
coup. Recently, the US has stepped up efforts to isolate Venezuela in the 
region. &nbsp;In August 2004, President Chávez won a referendum on his 
presidency by 59%, results which were certified by the OAS and Carter Center, 
and his popularity currently stands at over 70%. Yet earlier this week, 
Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld continued the Bush administration&#8217;s rhetorical 
assault against President Chávez, re-issuing old and unsupported claims 
regarding Venezuela. The US government&#8217;s ongoing hostility towards President 
Chávez have created the climate in which a Republican leader, a former candidate 
for the Republican nomination for president feels comfortable in calling for the 
United States to kill an elected head of state. If the US government wishes to 
give a veneer of credibility to its claims that they are not planning to kill 
President Chávez, it must forcefully condemn and initiate legal action against a 
key Republican ally for openly calling for his assassination. 
&nbsp;<BR>
&nbsp;<BR>
The US government&#8217;s hostility towards Venezuela stems more 
from that country&#8217;s creation of an alternative economic vision for the 
hemisphere than any unsubstantiated concerns about democracy. President Chávez 
has embarked on a series of economic reforms, such as funneling billions of oil 
industry profits into massive programs for health care, education, literacy, and 
clean water, and promoting regional integration, which fly in the face of Bush 
administration&#8217;s failed efforts to promote corporate globalization by 
establishing a Free Trade Area of the Americas. &#8220;The US government&#8217;s dislike for 
Chávez&#8217;s vision of a national economy that delivers development rather than free 
trade does not give the US government &#8211; or US government supporters - a license 
to kill,&#8221; said Deborah James. <BR>
&nbsp;<BR>
The US government has obligations 
under international law to prevent and punish acts of terrorism against foreign 
heads of state if those acts are conceived of or planned on US territory. The 
1973 United Nations <I>Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of Crimes 
Against Internationally Protected Persons</I> makes it a crime to commit a 
&#8220;murder, kidnapping, or other attack upon on the liberty of an internationally 
protected person; .. [including] a &#8220;threat to commit any such attack.&#8221; An 
internationally protected person means a head of state (or other specified 
persons.) <BR>
&nbsp;<BR>
The US is also a signatory to the 1971<I> Convention to 
Prevent and Punish Acts of Terrorism Taking the Form of Crimes Against Persons 
and Related Extortion that are of International Significance</I> of the 
Organization of the American States, Article 8a of which obliges &#8220;[t]he 
contracting states undertake to cooperate among themselves by taking all the 
measures that they may consider effective, under their own laws, and especially 
those established in this convention, <I>to prevent and punish acts of 
terrorism, especially kidnaping [sic], murder</I>, and other assaults against 
the life or physical integrity of those persons to whom the state has the duty 
according to international law to give special protection, as well as extortion 
in connection with those crimes.&#8221; (italics added.) This includes foreign heads 
of state as internationally protected persons. <BR>
&nbsp;<BR>
Global Exchange 
also calls for the investigation of the Christian Broadcasting Network for the 
potential illegality of using federally licensed airwaves to call for the 
assassination of a democratically-elected head of state. In light of the 
$550,000 fine against CBS for the accidental airing of a &#8220;wardrobe malfunction&#8221;, 
it would be ironic in the extreme if the CBN were not to be similarly punished 
for airing a call for terrorist homicide. <!-- #EndEditable -->
