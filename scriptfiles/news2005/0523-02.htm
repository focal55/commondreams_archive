<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SAN FRANCISCO, CA -- May 23 --  The Board of Directors of America's oldest and largest grassroots environmental organization this weekend elected Lisa Renstrom from Charlotte, North Carolina to serve as the Sierra Club's 51th president, a position first held by John Muir.  Renstrom has held local, state and national posts with the Sierra Club for more than a decade.</font><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The Sierra Club is revered by Americans who enjoy and respect the bounty and beauty of our nation,&quot; stated Renstrom. &quot;It's an honor to follow in the footsteps of John Muir and to build on his legacy to address the challenges of the 21st century.&quot;</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Renstrom stated that her priority for the next year would be to reengage Americans in conservation. &quot;I believe most Americans share the Sierra Club's goals of clean, safe energy, healthy communities and protecting our special wild places.  We need to work together to invest in America's future and promote responsibility and fairness.  We need to demand that our government -- the people we elect -- works for our common interests.&quot;</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">First elected by Sierra Club members to serve on the organization's national Board of Directors in 2001, Renstrom was re-elected in 2004, garnering the most votes in an election that drew the organization's highest turnout ever.  Following her re-election, Renstrom was tapped to serve as Chairman of the Board. In her time as a Director, Renstrom has already made her mark on the organization.  She is co-chair of the first-ever Sierra Club National Environmental Convention and Expo, taking place in San Francisco, September 8-11.  She also spearheaded a highly innovative capacity-building project for Sierra Club Chapters and Groups, teaming up with Marshall Gantz of Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Lisa's strong organizational skills, long history of Sierra Club service and commitment to finding visionary solutions to critical environmental problems makes her ideally suited to lead the organization to a future of great influence and accomplishment,&quot; said outgoing President Larry Fahn.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Though she didn't become an environmental activist until much later, Renstrom credits her early years growing up on a farm in Nebraska as the foundation for her bedrock environmental values.  &quot;My father had a 'waste not, want not' mentality that was typical of his Depression Era upbringing. The cycle of life was also very much a part of our world.  You can't help but marvel in the power and diversity of life when spring green dissolved winter's grey, when foals, kittens and goslings pop up everywhere.&quot;  Today, family is still a source of inspiration, and she is deeply proud of the fact that her husband and daughter are similarly involved in developing and promoting environmental solutions.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In addition to her contributions to the Sierra Club, Renstrom has had a successful career in international hotel management.  She has also served a number of other community and environmental organizations including WTVI, Charlotte's public television station; the Museum of Life and the Environment; and as Executive Director for Voices &amp; Choices, an organization dedicated to promoting economic and environmental sustainability in the Central Carolinas region.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>The Sierra Club's members are 750,000 of your friends and neighbors. Inspired by nature, they work together to protect communities and the planet.  Founded in 1892, the Sierra Club is America's oldest, largest, and most influential grassroots environmental organization.</i></font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
