<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- January 24 -- On the occasion of the United Nations General Assembly&#146;s special session commemorating the sixtieth anniversary of the liberation of the Nazi concentration camps, former Nuremberg War Crimes Prosecutor Benjamin Ferencz and Coalition for the International Criminal Court Convenor William Pace have issued the following statements:</font></p><p> </p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;The highest tribute we can pay to the memory of those who perished in past Holocausts is to prevent such atrocities from happening again. We must hold accountable those leaders responsible for the most massive crimes against humanity that terrorize innocent people everywhere. That is why the establishment of the International Criminal Court stands today as one of the most remarkable achievements of the past century.  Only equal justice applied equally to everyone can lead to a more peaceful and humane world.&#148;</font></p><p> </p><p><b><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#150;        Benjamin B. Ferencz was a Chief Prosecutor at the Nuremberg War Crimes Trials after World War II</font></i></b></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;The best way for the international community to honor the victims of the Nazi Holocaust is to work vigilantly to save future victims from this horrific fate. The International Criminal Court (ICC) is part of the legacy of the Nuremberg Trials. The ICC stands today as the world&#146;s &#147;never again&#148; court. Not only have we failed to achieve &#147;never again&#148; in our world, we have seen &#150; time and time again through the 1950s, the 1960s and straight up to the present-day &#150; repeated instances of mass crimes against humanity. The UN&#146;s commemoration today sheds light on why the creation of the International Criminal Court in 1998 constituted such a powerful step forward in history. While the codification of crimes and international law advanced enormously in the past century, the political will to enforce those laws languished until July 17, 1998 when the International Criminal Court moved from being a concept to being a reality.&#148;</font></p><p> </p><p><b><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#150;        William R.
