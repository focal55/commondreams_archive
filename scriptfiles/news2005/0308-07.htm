<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- March 8 -- Among the interests lobbying in support of the bankruptcy bill currently before the Senate is the credit industry, which has contributed more than $40 million to federal candidates and political parties since 1989. But the senators who have raised the most campaign money from credit card companies during that time do not include Bill Frist (R-Tenn.), the majority leader, or Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), the bill's sponsor.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">That distinction belongs to Olympia Snowe (R-Maine), who has raised $316,700 from the credit industry over the past 16 years, <a href="http://www.opensecrets.org/industries/summary.asp?Ind=F06&cycle=ALL&recipdetail=M&sortorder=U" target="_new">tops among current senators</a>. <a href="http://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/allcontrib.asp?CID=N00000480" target="_new">Virtually all of that</a> -- $300,700 -- has come from the employees and political action committee of MBNA, the nation's top credit card issuer. Snowe is fourth on the list when all current and past members of Congress are ranked.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sen. <a href="http://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/allindus.asp?CID=N00009920" target="_new">Richard Shelby</a> (R-Ala.) ranks second among current senators -- fifth overall -- in receipts from credit card companies since 1989, with $302,800. Sen. <a href="http://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/allindus.asp?CID=N00001669" target="_new">Joe Biden</a> (D-Del.) is third among current senators with $255,900, Sen. <a href="http://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/allindus.asp?CID=N00001093" target="_new">Chuck Schumer</a> is fourth with $253,700, and Sen. <a href="http://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/allindus.asp?CID=N00001604" target="_new">Arlen Specte</a>r is fifth with $231,800.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">These figures and many more can now be found on the Center for Responsive Politics' award-winning Web site, OpenSecrets.org. In addition to its two-year fundraising profiles of House members and six-year campaign contribution portraits of senators, the Center for the first time has created unique &quot;career profiles&quot; of members of Congress going back 16 years.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Career profiles display each lawmaker's top campaign donors by organization, industry and sector since 1989, when the Center first started comprehensively tracking federal campaign contributions. The profiles also include totals raised and spent by each member of Congress over the same period, as well as top ZIP codes.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For example, House Speaker Dennis Hastert's (R-Ill.)<a href="http://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/allindus.asp?CID=N00004781" target="_new"> top industry</a> during the past 16 years is the securities and investment industry, which has contributed $684,300 to him in individual and PAC contributions. Hastert's <a href="http://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/allcontrib.asp?CID=N00004781" target="_new">top organization</a> since 1989 is the American Medical Association, with $80,000 in contributions.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">House Majority Leader Tom DeLay (R-Texas) has raised $557,900 since 1989 from oil and gas interests, <a href="http://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/allindus.asp?CID=N00005892" target="_new">more than he has from any other industry</a>. His <a href="http://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/allcontrib.asp?CID=N00005892" target="_new">top donor</a> during that time is the National Auto Dealers Association, with $66,600 in contributions.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi (Calif.) has collected more from lawyers and law firms ($357,300) than from <a href="http://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/allindus.asp?CID=N00007360" target="_new">any other industry since 1989</a>. The labor union AFSCME <a href="http://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/allcontrib.asp?CID=N00007360" target="_new">tops her list of organizations</a> with $61,000 in contributions over the same period.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the Senate, Frist's career contributor list is <a href="http://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/allcontrib.asp?CID=N00003147" target="_new">topped</a> by HCA Healthcare, a hospital company founded by his father and brother. HCA's employees and PAC have sent Frist more than $83,500 since he entered the Senate in 1994. Frist has raised $1.3 million from doctors and other health professionals, his <a href="http://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/allindus.asp?CID=N00003147" target="_new">top industry</a>, during that time.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Democratic leader and Nevada Sen. Harry Reid has raised more than $158,500 from the PAC and employees of MGM Mirage, his <a href="http://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/allcontrib.asp?CID=N00009922" target="_new">top contributor </a>over the past 16 years. Casinos and gambling interests are second on his list of <a href="http://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/allindus.asp?CID=N00009922" target="_new">top industries</a> with $1.1 million. Lawyers and law firms are No. 1 with $1.9 million.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The <a href="http://www.opensecrets.org/industries/summary.asp?Ind=F07&cycle=ALL&recipdetail=M&sortorder=U" target="_new">securities and investment industry</a>, which has a major stake in the outcome of the Social Security debate, has topped the $1 million mark to nine current members of Congress and 10 former members. With $5.9 million in receipts, Schumer is the top recipient from the industry among current and former lawmakers.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sen. John Kerry (D-Mass.) is second on the all-time list securities and investment industry contributions. His total, which includes money raised during his 2004 presidential campaign, is $5.5 million since 1989.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The figures are based on the Center's processing of all individual and PAC contributions reported to the Federal Election Commission. The Center has grouped more than 6 million such donations to members of Congress since 1989 by employer or affiliated organization and coded those organizations by industry. Combined with contributions to challengers, presidential candidates, the national political parties and 527 groups, the Center's data is the most comprehensive available outside the FEC.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To access the career profiles, visit the the Center's <a href="http://www.opensecrets.org/industries/summary.asp?Ind=F07&cycle=ALL&recipdetail=M&sortorder=U" target="_new">politician lookup</a> and type in the name of a member of Congress. Then look for the career profile link on the left side of the page. Career profiles exist for members of the 108th Congress and will soon be created for the 109th Congress.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Center's career profiles were made possible by support from the Ford Foundation.</font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
