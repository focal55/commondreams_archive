<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->WASHINGTON - August 26 - Green Party leaders sharply criticized plans announced 
by the Pentagon to increase the number of U.S. troops in Iraq, and 
reiterated the party's call to begin withdrawing occupational forces from 
Iraq immediately.

<p>"We agree with Cindy Sheehan -- the only legitimate way to support our 
troops is to get them out of Iraq right now," said Andrea Garland, Louisiana 
Green who joined Ms. Sheehan at her Camp Casey protest vigil in Crawford, 
Texas.  "This will be the demand of Greens participating in the September 24 
rallies in Washington, D.C. against the occupation."

<p>The Green Party's Peace Action Committee (GPAX) announced an online petition 
urging the White House to end the occupation and supporting the Camp Casey 
vigil, at 
<http://www.demaction.org/dia/organizations/Greens/petition.jsp?petition_KEY=103>.

<p>GPAX recently issued a statement in support of Camp Casey 
<http://www.gp.org/press/pr_2005_08_10.shtml>, which national Green Party 
co-chair Rebecca Rotzler presented to Ms. Sheehan.

<p>Greens especially condemned statements from Democratic leaders supporting 
increased deployment, including Senators Hillary Clinton (N.Y.), Joe Biden 
(Del.) and John Kerry (Mass.).  Greens also rejected the position of Sen. 
Russell Feingold (D-Wis.), MoveOn.org, and others who favor a delayed 
withdrawal, including Sen. Feingold's call for removal of U.S. troops by 
December, 2006.

<p>"Greens do not demand that President Bush announce a plan to withdraw 
troops.  We demand that the President issue an order to begin withdrawal 
now," said Sarah "echo" Steiner, sister of an Iraqi Veteran, co-chair of the 
Green Party of Florida, and GPAX member.  "Another year of occupation will 
mean hundreds, perhaps thousands more U.S. troops dead and maimed; and tens 
of thousands more dead Iraqi civilians."

<p>Green Party leaders have called the Iraq invasion and occupation a 
catastrophe, noting that:

<p>
<ul>
<li>Between 25,000 and 100,000 Iraqi civilians have been killed in the war; 
the number of U.S. troops killed is approaching 2,000.

</li>
</ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li>The Bush Administration now admits that secular democracy is unlikely in 
Iraq; possible civil war, further breakdown of vital infrastructure, and 
establishment a repressive, misogynistic Islamic theocracy threaten the 
Iraqi people.

</li>
</ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Bush Administration officials, including the President, have not been held 
accountable for the litany of deceptive justifications for the invasion: 
nonexistent WMDs; forged evidence of nuclear weapons; fraudulent claims of 
conspiracy between al-Qaeda and Saddam Hussein and Iraqi involvement with 
the 9/11 attacks.

</li>
</ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Shocking revelations of torture at Abu Ghraib mirror the White House's own 
efforts to circumvent international and constitutional prohibitions against 
torture in Guantanamo Bay and elsewhere.

</li>
</ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Terrorist attacks have increased in countries allied with the U.S. (most 
recently Britain, in July), as predicted by opponents of the war before the 
2003 invasion.  Vice President Cheney continues to call Iraq a "critical 
front in the war on terror"; Greens, in agreement with recent CIA and other 
intelligence studies, assert that the occupation itself has motivated 
further attacks on the West and violence within Iraq, and threatens U.S. 
security and international stability.
<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>
The costs of the occupation are causing social needs in the U.S. to go 
unmet; while President Bush preaches sacrifice -- presumably for families 
who have lost children, parents, and spouses in the war, and for soldiers 
given insufficient armor and other equipment; meanwhile, he has granted tax 
cuts for the wealthy and indulged Halliburton and other favored firms 
multibillion-dollar contracts allowing them to profit from the war.

<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>
The war itself is a crime, violating international covenants signed by the 
U.S. against invasion of a nation on 'preventive' grounds; Hitler used 
preventive justifications (also fraudulent) for the German invasion of 
Czechoslovakia and Poland in 1939.

</li>
</ul>
<p>"These charges are not Green opinion.  They are statements of fact.  They're 
the reason why the Green Party has called for Mr. Bush's impeachment," said 
Tom Siracuse of the West Side (Manhattan) Greens and Veterans For Peace, 
both of which are represented at the Camp Casey vigil.  GPAX is urging 
Americans outraged by the Iraq venture to sign on to the Veterans For Peace 
petition for impeachment 
<http://www.veteransforpeace.org/impeachment/petition2.htm>, which is also 
linked at the GPAX web page <http://www.gp.org/committees/peace>.
