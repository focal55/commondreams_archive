WASHINGTON - November 2 - Former Bolivian president, Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada (1991-1997, 2002-2003) was served with legal documents today by U.S. citizens acting on behalf of Bolivian human rights organizations.  Mr. Sanchez de Lozada is being summoned to testify in an investigation undertaken by the Bolivian Office of the Attorney General where he is accused of the wrongful deaths, injuries, illegal imprisonment and other crimes against Bolivian citizens.  More than 50 people, including an 8-year old girl, were killed in the violent repression unleashed by Mr. Sanchez de Lozada against Bolivians protesting his regime in September and October 2003.  Shortly after the violence, the former president fled Bolivia and now resides in Washington, D.C. The legal documents request that Mr. Sanchez de Lozada return to Bolivia to testify within the next 45 days.

<p>Mr. Sanchez de Lozada was speaking at a wine and cheese reception sponsored by a non-profit group associated with Princeton University in downtown Washington, D.C.  After the State Department failed for four months to serve Mr. Sanchez de Lozada with the legal documents, Washington area residents became aware of his public appearance and decided to take matters into their own hands. The legal documents were transmitted to the U.S. State Department on June 22, 2005.
