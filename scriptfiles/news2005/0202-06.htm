<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p align="LEFT"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON &#150; 71 Members of the United States Congress sent a letter last night to US Treasury Secretary John Snow, urging him to negotiate an agreement that provides 100% cancellation of multilateral debts owed by impoverished countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America at the upcoming meeting of the G-7 Finance Ministers on February 4-5 in London.</font></p><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The letter, initiated by Rep. Maxine Waters (D-CA), Rep. Barney Frank (D-MA), Rep. Spencer Bachus (R-AL), and Rep. James Leach (R-IA) points out that &#147;Impoverished countries will never be able to eradicate poverty as long as they must continue to make payments on old loans they will never be able to repay. The poor people of impoverished countries need a chance; they need full debt cancellation.&#148;</font></p><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The letter goes onto explain that existing debt relief programs &#150; notably the IMF/World Bank&#146;s Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative have proven that debt relief is an effective way to reduce poverty, but that HIPC has &#147;failed to provide a lasting solution to the debt crisis.&#148;</font></p><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Signatories urged Secretary Snow to &#147;negotiate an agreement that provides 100% multilateral debt cancellation for all countries eligible for the HIPC Initiative, as well as other needy and deserving countries, at the upcoming G-7 Finance Ministers&#146; meeting.&#148;</font></p><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The letter follows on a similar letter sent last week by Republican Conference Chair Senator Rick Santorum (R-PA) and Senator Joseph Biden (D-DE), the Ranking Member on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, to Secretary Snow in support of more debt relief, including 100% multilateral cancellation. The Senate letter also urged action at this weekend&#146;s G-7 Finance Ministers meeting.</font></p><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The initiatives from Congress in support of full multilateral debt cancellation come in addition to efforts by advocates of debt cancellation to pressure the US administration to negotiate a deal this weekend. Yesterday, leading debt cancellation advocates delivered thousands of petition signatures to the US Treasury department calling for full and unconditional debt cancellation for all impoverished nations. </font></p><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">2) Letter from 71 Members of Congress to Secretary Snow</font></p><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">February 1, 2005</font></p><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Honorable John Snow<br>Secretary of the Treasury<br>Department of the Treasury<br>1500 Pennsylvania Ave., NW<br>Washington, DC  20220</font></p><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Dear Secretary Snow: </font></p><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">	As part of your efforts to achieve debt relief for the world&#146;s most impoverished countries, we write to urge you to<br>negotiate an agreement that provides 100% cancellation of multilateral debts owed by impoverished countries in Asia, Africa and<br>Latin America at the upcoming meeting of the G-7 Finance Ministers on February 4-5 in London.</font></p><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">	Impoverished countries will never be able to eradicate poverty as long as they must continue to make payments on old loans<br>that they never will be able to repay.  Money that impoverished countries must send to creditors such as the IMF and the World Bank<br>is money that is not spent on pressing social needs like health care, education and clean water.  Debt payments to multilateral<br>creditors also interfere with poor countries&#146; efforts to recover from disasters like the recent earthquake and tsunami in Asia.  The<br>people of impoverished countries need a chance; they need full debt cancellation.</font></p><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">	Existing programs that provide limited debt relief &#150; most notably the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative of<br>the IMF and the World Bank &#150; have proven that even partial debt relief is an effective way to reduce poverty.  The most recent<br>analysis of the HIPC Initiative by the IMF and the World Bank shows that since 1999, countries that received the limited debt relief<br>provided by the HIPC Initiative almost doubled their poverty-reduction expenditures.</font></p><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">	However, the limited relief available under the HIPC Initiative has failed to provide a lasting solution to the debt crisis.<br>HIPC countries still send more than $2 billion in debt service payments to the IMF and the World Bank each year.  Debt service<br>payments for HIPC countries have been reduced by less than one-third.  Furthermore, several impoverished countries that were<br>excluded from the HIPC Initiative are in urgent need of debt relief.</font></p><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">	We urge you to negotiate an agreement that provides 100% multilateral debt cancellation for all countries eligible for the<br>HIPC Initiative, as well as other needy and deserving countries, at the upcoming G-7 Finance Ministers&#146; meeting.  We look forward to<br>your response and to working with you to achieve a historic breakthrough canceling all of the multilateral debts of impoverished<br>countries early this year.</font></p><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Sincerely,</font></p><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>Maxine Waters					Spencer Bachus<br>Barney Frank					James A.
