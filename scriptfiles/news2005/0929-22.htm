<p align="left">WASHINGTON - September 29 - <P>Twenty-two. </P>
            <P>Only 22 senators had the courage to stand up for women's rights 
            when it mattered. NOW applauds those senators who voted to reject 
            this dangerous nominee, and it is unfortunate that the courageous 
            actions of a few are overshadowed by the fall-in-line politics of so 
            many more.</P>
            <P>In a full Senate vote of 78-22, John G. Roberts was confirmed 
            Thursday morning to become the next Chief Justice of the Supreme 
            Court. At the helm of the court, Roberts will soon hear cases about 
            women's reproductive rights, privacy issues, equal education 
            opportunities and a host of other issues that are at the heart of 
            women's equality in this country.</P>
            <P>"Republican senators, more worried about the political 
            intimidation of Karl Rove and Pat Robertson than about women's 
            rights and civil rights, voted in lockstep for Roberts. 
            Unfortunately, some Democratic senators also voted for a nominee who 
            refused to answer questions about our most basic rights," said NOW 
            President Kim Gandy. "We thank those senators who withstood the 
            pressure from the Bush administration and voted 'no' on behalf of 
            the women of this country. Women will remember their commitment to 
            our rights."</P>
            <P>Throughout the confirmation hearings, Roberts bobbed and weaved, 
            evading question after question from senators whose responsibility 
            was to determine Roberts' qualifications and judicial philosophy. 
            With so few answers, a vote to confirm was a vote that ignored the 
            palpable threat to women and people of color and disenfranchised 
            groups everywhere &#8212; a vote that will long be remembered. </P>
            <P><STRONG>The fight goes on</STRONG>. The <A 
            href="http://www.now.org/savethecourt">next nomination</A> will be 
            to replace swing-vote Sandra Day O'Connor, and women will be ready. 
            George Bush has an opportunity to replace the first female justice 
            with a woman who will act judiciously and not dismantle our 
            fundamental rights.</P>
            <P>"If Bush chooses a nominee whose only intention is to scale back 
            the rights we have fought decades to win, we are prepared for a 
            battle royal. Bring it on," said Gandy. "In the end, a line will be 
            drawn between the senators who vote based on personal conscience, 
            and the senators who vote based on political calculus." </P>
            <P>And on Nov. 7, 2006, and beyond, it will be women's turn to vote. 
            </P>
