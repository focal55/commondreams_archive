<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->WASHINGTON - September 13 - Coinciding with 
the opening of the UN World Summit on September 14 with over 175 heads of state, 
the San Francisco-based nonprofit Global Exchange placed a full-page ad in the 
New York Times denouncing Ambassador John Bolton&#8217;s attempt to derail the global 
gathering. &#8220;We are appalled at how the Bush administration has been thumbing its 
nose at the international effort to fight poverty, HIV/AIDS and global warning,&#8221; 
said Global Exchange founding director Medea Benjamin. &#8220;This ad helps expose the 
mean-spirited Bush agenda and calls on the public to stand up to the bully John 
Bolton.&#8221;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>The ad is part of an international campaign by both 
governments and non-governmental organizations to pressure John Bolton to back 
down from the outrageous changes he has been advocating to the document that 
will be signed by the world leaders. These changes included eliminating 
references to the Millenium Development Goals that 191 nations, including the 
United States, had agreed to in 2000. While Bolton later conceded to mentioning 
the goals, he refused to have the US join the rich nations in allocating 0.7% of 
their Gross Domestic Product to international assistance, claiming that the 
United States &#8220;does not accept global aid targets.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&#8220;It is 
especially sad in the wake of Hurricane Katrina that the US government does not 
want to commit to alleviating poverty and addressing global warming,&#8221; Benjamin 
said. &#8220;But the pressure from the world community is on, and hopefully the 
Bolton/Bush agenda will be defeated.&#8221;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>The New York Times ad can be

The ad text reads as follows:<BR>&nbsp;<BR>STILL DOING GEORGE BUSH'S DIRTY WORK. 
<BR>&nbsp;<BR>"I'm with the Bush-Cheney team and I'm here to stop the count." 
-John Bolton, December 9th, 2000 <BR>&nbsp;<BR>In the disputed election of 2000, 
John Bolton was in Florida to bring the democratic process to a screeching halt 
before there could be a fair and full counting of the votes.His bullying worked. 
<BR>&nbsp;<BR>Now Bush's human wrecking ball has hit the United Nations. His 
mission: to make the UN over in the image of the Bush-Cheney administration. 
While talking "reform" Bolton has demanded change to the international agreement 
that 175 countries, including the United States, had painstakingly negotiated 
over the past year: Oppose cooperation on global warming. Take out references to 
"corporate accountability." Dilute the call for "participation and 
representation" of women. Reneging on previous U.S. agreements to fight poverty, 
Bolton has even tried to force language into the agreement that would reward 
Bush-Cheney contributors. Pharmaceutical companies would reap higher profits 
from price protections on drugs sold to the poorest people with AIDS. Energy 
companies and other polluters would profit from undermining efforts to reduce 
global warming. <BR><BR>A bull in the china shop," says one respected human 
rights leader as he watches Bolton swinging away. But Bolton is a bully, not a 
bull. And the only way to deal with a bully is to stand up to him. <!-- #EndEditable -->
