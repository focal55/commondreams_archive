<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- March 10 -- Pride at Work, the national organization of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender workers, today praised the AFL-CIO for criticizing the proposed Federal Marriage Amendment.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In a unanimous resolution on March 3, the AFL-CIO Executive Council declared that &quot;the FMA and its state counterparts threaten the rights of working people by creating an environment across the nation that is hostile to the rights of domestic partners, regardless of their sexual orientation.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Unions will have an increasingly difficult time making gains in domestic partner benefits, and preserving those benefits that they have already won at the table.&quot;<br>	<br>The Executive Council resolution noted, &quot;The AFL-CIO recognizes that families come in all shapes and sizes.&quot; It added that for more than a generation, unions have negotiated domestic partner benefits, including health care, family and medical leave, and other benefits, for their members, both LGBT and straight.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The resolution also reiterated the AFL-CIO's &quot;longstanding support for the full inclusion and equal rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people in the workplace and in society.&quot;<br>	<br>Pride at Work co-presidents Nancy Wohlforth and Josh Cazares said, &quot;We're delighted that the AFL-CIO has taken this stand.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;It's the right thing to do. It happened because of the strong leadership of President John Sweeney in bringing this resolution to the entire Executive Council and the hard work of Executive Vice-President Linda Chavez-Thompson.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The AFL-CIO Executive Council resolution, &quot;Support for the Full Inclusion and Equal Rights of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender People in the Workplace,&quot; is on line at: <a href="http://www.aflcio.org/aboutaflcio/ecouncil/ec03032005g.cfm" target="_new">www.aflcio.org/aboutaflcio/ecouncil/ec03032005g.cfm</a>.<br> <br><i>Pride At Work is a constituency group (community or identity group) affiliated with the American Federation of Labor - Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL-CIO).
