<p>WASHINGTON - September 20 - One girl in Texas founded an organization to protest a nuclear waste facility at the age of 13.  Another, at the age of 17, started a wetlands rehabilitation project in her neighborhood in San Francisco.  And a 15 year old boy from Florida is on a mission to save the loggerhead sea turtles from extinction.   These are just three of the seven incredible young activists from around the country who will receive a 2005 Brower Youth Award – the most prestigious award in the country for leaders of tomorrow’s environmental and social justice movements.  

 

<p>"It is both humbling and exciting to witness the courageous leadership of young people today,” said Julia Butterfly Hill, the well-known activist who lived in an ancient redwood tree for two years in order to save them, and will be one of the hosts of this year’s ceremony.  “The Brower Youth Awards acknowledge the vital role young people play in our world, and the event itself is truly one of the most inspiring of the year." 

 

<p>Each Brower Youth Award carries a $3,000 prize. The seven awardees will be honored at a public ceremony at the Calvin Simmons Auditorium in Oakland, California on Friday, September 30.  Recipients are from California, Arizona, Massachusetts, New Mexico and Florida.  Julia Butterfly Hill will host the ceremony along with social justice attorney and advocate Van Jones, founder and director of the Ella Baker Center for Human Rights.  There will also be a musical performance by Crown City Rockers and spoken word by Youth Speaks.  More information can be found at http://www.earthisland.org/bya/.

 

<p>In its sixth year, the award is named for David Brower, the firebrand environmentalist who inspired a growing conservation movement from the 1950s until his death in 2000 at age 88.  Brower founded the San Francisco-based Earth Island Institute in 1982 to incubate new projects and leaders in environmental advocacy.

 

<p>“The Brower Youth Awards give voice and resources to an optimistic, energized and fearless group of young people working on solutions to today’s environmental and social justice problems,” said program director Jason Salfi.  “We hope to help motivate them to continue doing what they’re doing.”             

 

<p>The 2005 Brower Youth Award winners are:

 

<p><b>Erika Chase and Kayla Carpenter, 17</b>, Hoopa, CA<br>
Friends since the fourth grade, Erika and Kayla have always been active in their hometown of 4,000 people.  They both worked on their school yearbook, participated in the Youth Tribal Council, and most recently organized the third Salmon Run Relay to raise awareness about the plight of the nearby rivers and the fish populations that depend on them.  According to Erika and Kayla, more and more water from the Klamath and Trinity rivers is being used to grow strawberries, barley and other crops that require dams and heavy irrigation.  As a result, the water table is low, and the salmon, sturgeon and trout populations are rapidly dwindling. “If the river isn’t healthy for the salmon it’s not going to be healthy for us,” says Kayla.  In addition to raising awareness about the rivers, the Salmon Run Relay also educates the community about their native diet and culture by holding a salmon ceremony based on the ancient rituals of the Yurok, Hupa and Karuk Indian tribes. 

<p><b>Andrea Garza, 21, </b>Albuquerque, NM<br>
Andrea was only 13 years old when she founded Esperanza Unida, a group focusing on social and environmental justice issues in Brownsville, Texas, where she grew up.  The group began its political activism by protesting a proposed nuclear waste facility in the state, which after much lobbying and vocal opposition by several groups, was defeated.  Esperanza Unida then shifted its focus to doing presentations in schools, educating students about their Aztec roots, culture and traditions.  While Esperanza Unida is continuing in Brownsville, Andrea has moved to Albuquerque, New Mexico where she is a community organizer for Young Women United, a group started by and servicing young women of color.   This year Andrea and the teenage girls lobbied their school board to allow comprehensive sex education in schools, rather than abstinence only, so that there would be less teen pregnancy and lower drop-out rates.  A few months ago they found out that their efforts were a success! “As a woman of color it’s really empowering for me to come here every day,” says Andrea.  “Being an outlet and a mentor for these young women is my passion and what keeps me going.” 

<p><b>Jessica Rimington, 19, </b>Cotuit, MA<br>
Last year 19-year-old Jessica Rimington visited South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda, Morocco, Ethiopia, Mongolia, Costa Rica and Mexico to create a path toward better communication between the young people in these countries and the United States.  Taking a year off between high school and Georgetown’s School of Foreign Service, where she will start as a freshman this fall, she launched the One World Youth Project (www.oneworldyouthproject.org) to promote cultural exchange, youth leadership and community service around the world. The students, who are paired with a school from another country, start out by learning about each other’s culture, and then work together on a community service project inspired by the UN Millennium Development Goals.  There are now 36 schools in 16 countries participating in the program. Teachers are provided with a year-long curriculum to facilitate the exchange. “As young people we are not just the future; we are the present,” says Jessica.  “If we want to change the world we have to not only take action ourselves, but also inspire others to do the same.”  

<p><b>Daniel Rosen, 19, </b>Flagstaff, AZ<br>
In 2003 Daniel traveled to the Navajo Reservation in Pinon, Arizona to attend the “Healing and Redefining Our World Youth Summit.”  The summit was a gathering of people who all strongly believed in the power of community-based action to impact environmental and social injustices. It was this experience that inspired Daniel to help organize the “All Peoples Power Summit: Building Communities of Hope, Strength and Sustainability,” which attracted nearly 200 youth from around the globe.  Daniel then founded the Youth Movement in Northern Arizona to implement the ideas that came from the summit.   For example, the Youth Farming and Fresh Produce Initiative is working to create a bio-regional farming network on the Navajo and Hopi reservations to provide healthy foods to local communities.   And the Art of Revolution project finds spaces for young people to express themselves through mural painting, graffiti, and spoken word.  With all of these projects plus attending school at Northern Arizona State, Daniel still works on organizing summits, which he sees as crucial to his work.    “We are essentially fire-fighters putting out one bad policy after another,” he says.  “These gatherings allow us to have a perspective of where we are in the battle and where we need to be going.”  
<p><b>La Constance Shahid, 18</b>, San Francisco, CA<br>
La Constance Shahid is a breath of fresh air in her inner-city San Francisco neighborhood of Bay View Hunter’s Point.  Quite literally, her work to restore the adjacent Yosemite Wetlands (named after Yosemite Street, not the national park) helps to “improve the air and water quality,” she says, “which we definitely need.”  She is an active member of the Plants Gone Wild Native Plant Nursery Project, whose goal is to combat the destructive effects of industrialization and landfills on native wetlands.   La Constance also works to get all of the young people in the community involved by putting up posters, speaking at youth groups and recruiting around the neighborhood.  So far she and her peers have repaired the community garden at Candlestick Point Recreation Area, built a 1,200 square foot shade house to host native California seedlings, and created a strong community of youth activists who care about community stewardship.  Their goal is to grow 10,000 plants needed for the Yosemite Wetlands Restoration Project.  What does La Constance like about it most?  “I like all of the fresh air and that it’s quiet,” she says.  

<p><b>Zander Srodes, 15</b>, Placida, FL<br>
When Zander Srodes is not sailing or golfing in his hometown of Placida, Florida he is doing everything he can to save the Loggerhead Sea Turtles from extinction.  These turtles have been listed as threatened since 1978, and because Florida beaches account for one third of the world's total population of loggerheads, their ability to thrive there is crucial.  Zander speaks to K-6 graders about what they can do to help protect these prehistoric-looking reptiles, which can weigh up to 350 pounds and measure up to 3 feet in length.  Wearing a sea turtle costume that he made and using a power point presentation, Zander urges the kids to clean up after themselves on the beach so that the turtles don’t end up eating their trash or getting caught in beach furniture (he shows photos to prove this can happen).  Most recently, Zander has made an illustrated activity book to hand out at the end of his presentations, for which he has already had over 1,000 requests.  While the sea turtles are Zander’s main focus, he knows that his teachings are relevant to other species.  “If you’re protecting sea turtles you’re protecting a lot of other creatures in the environment,” he says.  “They represent the larger topic of environmental awareness.”<!-- #EndEditable --><p align="center">###</p></font></td>
