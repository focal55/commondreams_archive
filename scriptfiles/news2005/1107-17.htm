<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->WASHINGTON - November 7 - Unprecedented political and legislative attacks bring activists from every corner of the country to Creating Change Conference on Nov. 9–13 to plan political strategy, activate and energize LGBT forces
<p><b>What: <br>
</b>More than 2,500 lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) rights advocates are expected to convene in Oakland on Nov. 9–13 for the Creating Change Conference to prepare for the critical 2006 mid-term elections and build skills to advance LGBT rights. The conference opens just one day after the 2005 off-year elections, which include anti-gay ballot initiatives in Texas and Maine. 

<p>The conference serves as the premier — and largest — annual meeting of the national LGBT community, where the agenda for upcoming battles is set. 
 
<p><b>Who: <br>
</b>The conference reflects the breadth and scope of diversity of the LGBT community and supporters of LGBT rights. Speakers include Task Force Executive Director Matt Foreman, a leading voice in the national LGBT rights movement; Malcolm Gladwell, author of the bestselling book, The Tipping Point; Rev. Dr. Yvette Flunder, founder and senior pastor of City of Refuge United Church of Christ in San Francisco; Helen Zia, author of Asian American Dreams: The Emergence of an American People; Juba Kalamka, founding member of "homohop" crew, Deep Dickollective, known for his commentary on the convergences and conflicts of race, identity, sexuality and class in pop culture; and Arcus Foundation Executive Director Urvashi Vaid, among many others. 

<p>Workshops and pre-conference institutes include a People of Color Organizing Institute; Building a National LGBT Aging Agenda; The Marriage Movement: Developing a Long-Term Campaign Plan; the first-ever National Town Hall Meeting of LGBT Asian Pacific Americans; Strategic Talk About Transgender Lives: Changing Hearts and Minds; and Empowering People of Faith to Create Change, part of the conference's spiritual track.  
<p><b>Where: <br>
</b>Oakland Marriott City Center<br>

1001 Broadway<br>

Oakland, California  <br>

<p>When: November 9–13, 2005 
<p>Why: Lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people today are facing unprecedented attacks — since 2004, 14 anti-gay ballot initiatives have been passed; another 4 are confirmed for 2006, with possibly a dozen more on the ballot. The Creating Change Conference is convened annually by the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force following the national elections to regroup, strategize and build political power in the LGBT community from the ground up. This important gathering seeks to counter orchestrated efforts by the right wing to block LGBT people from securing basic and equal rights. Creating Change is the national LGBT community's call to action, and people from every corner of the country respond to work together to turn back the right wing and advance equality.
