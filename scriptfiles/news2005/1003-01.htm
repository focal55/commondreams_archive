<p>NEW YORK - In his September 27 online column, NPR Ombudsman Jeffrey Dvorkin responded to FAIR's September 21 <a mce_real_href="http://www.fair.org/index.php?page=2668" href="http://www.democracyinaction.org/dia/track.jsp?key=41879617&url_num=16&url=http://www.fair.org/index.php?page=2668">Action Alert</a>
regarding a Morning Edition report on terrorism that implied that only
"extremist groups" perceived a connection between the recent London
subway bombings and Britain's involvement in Iraq. Below is Dvorkin's
response
<br>
<b>A 'FAIR' Question</b><br>
<br>
One more issue from last week: the media watchdog group, FAIR (Fairness
and Accuracy in Reporting), criticized NPR about a report that aired on
Morning Edition on Sept. 15.<br>
<br>
The report, by NPR's Corey Flintoff, referred to an anti-terrorism
resolution being debated at the United Nations in light of last
summer's bombings in London. The report went on to say that:<br>
<br>
<div class="sideindent">Some extremist groups say those bombings were a response to the U.S. and British military presence in Iraq.</div> <br>
<br>
Hundred of listeners and supporters of FAIR wrote to object to the
phrase "extremist groups" to describe those who oppose the war in Iraq.<br>
<br>
Paul Fiscella wrote:<br>
<br>
<div class="sideindent">Do you believe as [the] Flintoff report implies
that only an "extremist" could acknowledge a connection between acts of
terrorism and foreign policy? Please encourage NPR to air a
clarification of Flintoff's remarks.</div><br>
<br>
Ted Clark is the Deputy Foreign Editor at NPR:<br>
<br>
<div class="sideindent">I don't think a correction is warranted. There
is no error...just a difference of interpretation... The author of the
letter(s) interpreted the sentence as meaning 'that only terrorists or
their sympathizers perceived such a connection.'<br>
<br>
The fact that 'some extremist groups' perceive the connection does not
rule out the possibility that non-extremists also perceive the
connection. The sentence can also be interpreted this way: Extremist
groups THAT ENDORSED THE BOMBINGS say they were a response to the U.S.
and British military presence in Iraq. That is what we meant when we
wrote the sentence. If we had wanted to say, 'only terrorists and their
sympathizers perceive a connection between the bombings and the war,'
we would have written the sentence that way. I will grant you that our
sentence could have been written more precisely.</div><br>
<br>
But the report was unclear and an editor should have caught the
imprecision before it aired. I think NPR owes the listeners an on-air
correction and clarification. The issue (the war in Iraq) is too
important to be bogged down in editorial nuance, especially if the
subtleties go unappreciated by the listeners.<br>
<br>
<div style="text-align: center;">*****</div><br>
FAIR thanks Dvorkin for raising the issue with an NPR editor and
encouraging the network to air a correction and clarification. We would
only add that the real problem with NPR's report was not that it didn't
specify the type of "extremist groups" it was referring to, but that it
framed the debate as one between terrorist sympathizers and British
Prime Minister Tony Blair. As we explained in our alert, this leaves
out the large majority of the public that agrees with neither.<br>
<br>
Thanks as well to FAIR readers who wrote to Dvorkin in response to our alert.
