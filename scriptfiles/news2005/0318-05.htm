<p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- March 18 -- News Advisory: Javier Couso, brother of Jose Couso, the Spanish camerman murdered by US troops in Baghdad on April 8, 2003, will hold a press conference on March 21, 2005 at 12 noon in the Murrow Room of the National Press Club in Washington DC. In the company of a delegation of the family, friends and colleagues of Jose Couso in Spain, he will announce the beginning of a tour through several cities of the US to continue the family's pursuit of an independent investigation and justice for the perpetrators of the attack on the Hotel Palestine.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Javier Couso: &quot;The attack on the Italian journalist shows yet again that the US military has decided that journalists are fair game in Iraq. The Bush administration agreed to a full investigation of the attack on Giuliana Sgrena, so we believe that a full, independent investigation is long overdue into the attack which killed my brother. Then, those responsible should be brought to justice. Our visit to the US is aimed at building public support for these goals.&quot;</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The visit to the US will feature speaking engagements with the screening of a powerful documentary entitled &quot;Palestine Hotel: Killing the Witness,&quot; never before seen in the United States.
