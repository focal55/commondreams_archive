<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">HONOLULU -- May 19  -- The Ocean Conservancy is pleased to announce the final results for the 2004 International Coastal Cleanup. Now in its 20th year, The Ocean Conservancy's International Coastal Cleanup program is the largest single-day volunteer event of its kind, with volunteers from across the globe helping to keep their marine environment clean. The results show the need for people to act more responsibly, particularly when engaged in recreational activities on or near the water, which account for nearly 61 percent of the marine debris collected during the Cleanup.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Marine debris, like that cleaned up during the International Coastal Cleanup, can damage pristine coral reefs and kill thousands of fish, seabirds and marine mammals each year. The problem received a full chapter in last year's major report by the US Commission on Ocean Policy, appointed by President Bush. The report stated: &quot;While marine debris is a global problem requiring international cooperation, many of its negative impacts are experienced at the local level and require local involvement.&quot;</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The good news is that hundreds of thousands of volunteers have answered the call to help remove this debris. The Cleanup, held on September 18 of last year, brought out over 300,000 citizens of 88 countries to help clean over 11,000 miles of shoreline. Volunteers removed nearly 8 million pounds of trash, litter, and debris worldwide. In the United States, 158,000 volunteers from 49 states and territories, ranging from Maine to Guam and all points in-between, cleaned over 8,000 miles of beaches, streams and riverbanks. These dedicated individuals helped remove almost 4 million pounds of marine debris from our waterways, despite widespread postponements along the East Coast due to several hurricanes.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The fact that these people were still willing to do something responsible for their marine environment after the impact of Hurricane Jeanne and the other storms is astonishing, and it really says quite a bit about the importance of clean waterways for our volunteers,&quot; said Seba Sheavly, International Coastal Cleanup director, while in Honolulu for the Cleanup's annual conference. Attendees of this year's conference include Cleanup volunteer coordinators and representatives from National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the U.S. Coast Guard, and other agencies.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Volunteers in California, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, Texas and New York were among those who removed the heaviest quantities of debris. More than half of all debris was from recreational shoreline activities, emphasizing the importance of conscientious behavior while enjoying our beaches and waterways. These items included cigarette butts, food wrappers and containers, beverage bottles, and plastic bags. Particularly dangerous items included syringes, lobster traps, canvas tarps, and especially derelict fishing gear.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sheavly hopes that the dedication exhibited by 2004 Cleanup participants will motivate even more people to come out for the 20th Annual International Coastal Cleanup, scheduled for September 17, 2005. Starting with a local cleanup on South Padre Island, TX in 1986, the Cleanup has grown into a worldwide phenomenon, giving people an annual opportunity to help keep their local marine environment clean and free of debris. In its 20th year, the International Coastal Cleanup is a celebration of cleaner beaches and healthier oceans.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Thanks to the Cleanup, The Ocean Conservancy has helped find meaningful solutions to the marine debris problem. These solutions include Congressional legislation like the Marine Debris Research and Reduction Act of 2005; international agreements like the MARPOL Convention, which deals with pollution from ships in international waters; and initiatives from the private sector. But changing human behavior is the best prevention, since human fingerprints are on every piece of trash we find in the ocean. &quot;Making sure people act responsibly is the crucial component, and not just during cleanups but year-round, too,&quot; said Sheavly. &quot;Changing human behavior is the key to solving pollution and the marine debris problem.&quot;</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">State-by-state data is available upon request.
