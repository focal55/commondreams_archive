<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - July 1  - Like all Americans, the Sierra Club is grateful for Justice Sandra Day O'Connor's historic service on the U.S. Supreme Court.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Never before have the courts played such an important role in protecting our clean air, drinking water, and special places.  And when it comes to appointing a new Justice of the Supreme Court, the stakes for the country could not be higher.   In the next few years, the Supreme Court could decide whether citizens even have access to the courts to protect clean air, water and wildlife, and whether Congress has the power to protect these natural resources.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A new Justice will help shape the law of the land and the government for decades to come. In doing so, he/she will have an extraordinary impact on the lives, liberties, and rights of all Americans, their children, and their grandchildren.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Because the stakes are so high, President Bush should follow in the tradition of his predecessors by consulting with the minority party in the Senate before announcing a nomination. He can save the nation from a divisive fight and ensure a safe and healthy environment by exercising leadership now and nominating consensus candidates with mainstream records.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">more information at <a href="http://www.sierraclub.org/politics/judicialnominations/" target="_new">http://www.sierraclub.org/politics/judicialnominations/</a></font></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">###</font></p><!-- #EndEditable -->
