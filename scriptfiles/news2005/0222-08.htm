<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- February 22 -- News Advisory: On Saturday, Feb. 26th, more than 100 fully decorated hybrid cars and SUVs from all over the region will converge on Annapolis to show support for the Maryland Clean Cars Act. These colorful vehicles will drive circles around the Maryland Statehouse and the Governor's mansion, then drivers will meet on foot for a rally to promote the bill.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The parade comes just days before the Maryland House of Delegates holds a hearing on the Clean Cars Act. This bill would add Maryland to a list of eight other states, including California and nearby New Jersey, that require the sale of much cleaner cars within their states (visit <a href="http://chesapeakeclimate.org/clean_cars.htm" target="_new">http://chesapeakeclimate.org/clean_cars.htm</a> ).</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Separate caravans of cars will be leaving rendezvous sites Saturday morning in Frederick, Salisbury, D.C., Montgomery County, Prince George's County, and Baltimore. The caravans will converge in Annapolis at the Navy football stadium parking lot for the final parade through the capital at noon. The post-parade rally will feature elected officials, health experts, and environmental leaders, and will begin at 1 p.m. (location to be announced).</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Media coming to Annapolis: You are advised to congregate at Lawyer's Mall, just in front of the Maryland Statehouse, no later than noon on Saturday. Cameras will get good views of the long line of decorated cars from this location. Parade spokespersons will also be available at Lawyer's Mall to answer questions as the vehicles encircle the Statehouse and Governor's mansion.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Media outside of Annapolis: Please call for the time and location of vehicles leaving from your area on Saturday morning. Local spokespersons will be available on-site to answer questions. Vehicles will be decorated for photo opportunities. Caravans will be leaving from Frederick, Salisbury, D.C., Montgomery County, Prince George's County, and Baltimore before 10 a.m.</font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
