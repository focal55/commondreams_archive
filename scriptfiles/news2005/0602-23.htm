<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON --June 2-- Today The Wilderness Society launched an online campaign to commemorate the 5th anniversary of the National Landscape Conservation System (NLCS) a promising yet neglected fledgling land management system. The campaign website, <a href="http://ga1.org/campaign/nlcsanniv" target="_new">http://ga1.org/campaign/nlcsanniv</a>, encourages visitors to send a message to Interior Secretary Gale Norton urging her to make land conservation a priority for the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), the agency that manages all NLCS lands. Visitors can also learn more about this unique land management system that focuses on preserving entire sections of ecosystems and culturally important landscapes.

 

</font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">“The National Landscape Conservation System is the most innovative American land system created in the last 50 years,” said The Wilderness Society President William H. Meadows. “But we're concerned that the Interior Department is missing the point.  Rather than using the NLCS as it was intended - to truly conserve natural and cultural values by protecting large landscapes that encompass whole ecosystems and communities - the Interior Department is under funding the program and focusing on oil and gas drilling rather than conservation of our best Western lands." 

 

</font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In June of 2000 the National Landscape Conservation System was established to encompass the crown jewels of the public lands managed by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM). This new conservation system consists of more than 26 million acres: National Monuments, Wilderness Study Areas, Wild and Scenic Rivers, National Conservation Areas, and National and Scenic Trails.  However, since its inception, the NLCS has been under-funded, under-staffed and under-protected. Today the NLCS is simply a nascent collection of extraordinary places, plagued by small staff, inadequate funds, and a managing agency that has traditionally focused on commodity production rather than conservation.

 

</font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">“These incredible places are particularly vulnerable because they lack the high public profile of the national parks,” says The Wilderness Society’s Wendy Van Asselt, who coordinates the NLCS campaign. “But we’ve found that people who learn about this conservation system want it protected, and their thousands of letters to the BLM and Congress have enabled us to beat back threats.” 

 

</font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">One example is the beautiful Canyon of the Ancients National Monument in Colorado.  Canyon of the Ancients has the nation’s highest density of archeological sites, with at least 6,000 known sites and possibly as many as 30,000.  Rather than protecting this culturally and historically important area, the BLM may allow the oil and gas industry to drill in this area, threatening ancient ruins, artifacts, and wildlife habitat. 

 

</font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In addition to the online campaign, the anniversary observances will include events ranging from group hikes to NLCS land beautification projects to conferences and other events.  Information about these events is available at: <a href="http://www.discovernlcs.org/Resources/calendar/" target="_new">http://www.discovernlcs.org/Resources/calendar/</a> </font><p>&nbsp;
