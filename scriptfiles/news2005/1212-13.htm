<p>NAIROBI - December 12 - President Omar El Bashir of Sudan and other senior officials should be investigated for crimes against humanity in Darfur and placed on a U.N. sanctions list, Human Rights Watch said today in a new <a href="http://hrw.org/reports/2005/darfur1205/">report</a> published in advance of upcoming U.N. Security Council discussions on Darfur. The Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court is scheduled to brief the Council tomorrow on his investigation into atrocities in Darfur. </p>

The 85-page report, “<a href="http://hrw.org/reports/2005/darfur1205/">Entrenching Impunity: Government Responsibility for International Crimes in Darfur</a>,” documents the role of more than a dozen named civilian and military officials in the use and coordination of  “Janjaweed” militias and the Sudanese armed forces to commit war crimes and crimes against humanity in Darfur since mid-2003. (See below for a partial list of individuals who should be investigated by the International Criminal Court.)
&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>“The Sudanese government’s systematic attacks on civilians in Darfur have been accompanied by a policy of impunity for all those responsible for the crimes,” said Peter Takirambudde, Africa director at Human Rights Watch. “Senior Sudanese officials—including President Omar El Bashir—must be held accountable for the campaign of ethnic cleansing in Darfur.”
&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>The Human Rights Watch report describes the process, replicated across Darfur, in which militia leaders collaborated with regional administrators and military commanders, usually meeting to co-ordinate strategy prior to attacks on rural villages and towns. By early 2004 it was clear, even to some soldiers, that civilians were the targets. One former soldier told Human Rights Watch that when he protested to his commander, he was told, “You have to attack the civilians.”  
&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>Human Rights Watch said that the looting and destruction of villages was not just condoned by government officials, it was methodically organized, with troops and militia members permitted to take land, livestock and other civilian property. Senior Sudanese officials played a direct role coordinating the offensives—and particularly the aerial bombing campaign—from Khartoum. 
&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>The report also examines the Sudanese government’s dismal record on accountability. Despite several Sudanese government initiatives, including a national inquiry into the crimes, numerous committees established to investigate rape and other crimes, and a national tribunal to try the perpetrators of crimes in Darfur, not a single mid- or high-level civilian official, military commander or militia leader has been suspended from duty, investigated or prosecuted.
&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>“The Sudanese government feigns compliance with international demands by setting up committees that produce absolutely no results,” said Takirambudde. “The ICC should investigate key actors at every level, including regional officials.” 
&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>The report is based on hundreds of eyewitness accounts, more than ten investigations by Human Rights Watch in Chad and Darfur, and Sudanese government documents, as well as secondary sources.  It reveals the strategy and network behind the Sudanese government’s massive counter-insurgency campaign against rebel groups in Darfur in early 2003, when government forces and government-backed militias known as the “Janjaweed” killed, raped and tortured tens of thousands of people, mainly those sharing the ethnicity of the rebel movements, forcibly displaced more than two million people, and looted or destroyed all their property.
&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>The U.N. Security Council will receive three reports on Darfur in December:  the final report and recommendations of the Panel of Experts of the Sanctions Committee; the monthly report of the U.N. Secretary General; and the ICC Prosecutor’s briefing. In March the Council referred Darfur to the ICC and the Prosecutor opened an investigation on June 6.
&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>Although the U.N. Security Council established a mechanism in March 2005 to enforce a partial arms embargo and to impose sanctions on individuals committing abuses, not a single person has yet been sanctioned by the U.N. 
&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>“Nine months ago the Security Council set up a Sanctions Committee to penalize individuals responsible for abuses in Darfur but it has yet to act against anyone,” said Takirambudde. “If the Security Council wants to see real progress in Darfur it must act now.” 
&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>Human Rights Watch also called on the Security Council to provide more support to the African Union Mission in Sudan (AMIS), which has deployed approximately 7,000 personnel in Darfur, and for AMIS to actively protect civilians in Darfur. 
&nbsp;<br> 
&nbsp;<br>The African Union is not only providing troops in Darfur; it is negotiating a peace agreement between the Sudanese government and the Darfur rebel groups. Despite the Sudanese government’s involvement in ongoing crimes in Darfur, the A.U. is allowing Sudan to host January’s A.U. summit in the capital, Khartoum. A new A.U. president is also due to be elected, and there are indications that President Bashir might obtain the post. 
&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>“Having the A.U. summit in Khartoum is bad enough, but giving President Bashir—who should be investigated for war crimes—the A.U. chair would be a travesty,” said Takirambudde.
&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>Partial list of individuals who should be investigated by the ICC:
