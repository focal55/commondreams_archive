<p>NEWPORT NEWS, Virginia - December 7 - DoubleTake, the influential magazine of documentary and - literary arts, combined forces with another journal, Points of Entry: Cross-Currents in Storytelling in
order to bring to the American public a new magazine which documents the contemporary world in
essay, fi ction, poetry and photography.
<p>DoubleTake was founded in 1995, and went on a publishing hiatus in 2003. The union of
DoubleTake with Points of Entry will increase the audience of the two magazines to serve not only
general readers interested in documentary work in narrative and photography, fi ction and poetry,
but practitioners such as teachers, journalists and writers. As Robert Coles noted in the fi rst issue of
his magazine in 1995, “We regard the magazine as an educational institution and the teachers and
librarians of the country are, for us, colleagues.”
<p><b>First Issue Focuses on World Children and Cultural Perceptions
</b>
<p>The premiere, Spring 2006 issue of the bi-annual DoubleTake/Points of Entry presents
children of the world from a variety of perspectives: Scott Campbell, an American soldier,
documents, through word and photograph, his experience with barefoot children struggling in
wintry Afghanistan during the war.
<p>Maggie Silverstein photographs children in Massachusetts during a ten-year period as they
grow into adulthood and Pulitzer-Prize winning writer Madeleine Blais describes the process from a
mother's perspective. Half-way across the world, photographer Stephanie Sinclair creates quiet and
penetrating portraits of Israeli settler children playing in their sea-side homes and then learning that
they will be removed from Gaza.
<p>In order to bear witness to particular, individual lives, DoubleTake/Points of Entry switches
the usual focus of the camera, allowing the subjects to record their own lives as well. Through
Duke University's pioneering “Learning through Photography” program, children show us the
neighborhoods of Durham, North Carolina, while in Concord, New Hampshire, Danny Gleason,
a twelve-year-old painter, struggles to capture his frightening world, suddenly rearranged by the
events of September 11, 2001.
<p><b>The World's Literary Arts and Artists </b>
<p>Fiction and poetry will also focus on cultural perceptions and misperceptions. Short story,
“Machu Picchu” by Sandra Cisneros introduces new immigrants' hopes and fantasies while Mythili Rao, portrays an Indian father and his American-born daughter as they negotiate new cultural
terrain.
<p>Indic scholar, Graham Schweig provides a new translation of an ancient Hindu text
to American audiences through his translation of the Råsa
Lîlå
from the Indian scripture
the <i>Bhågavata
Puråna</i>. The new translation, from
Schweig’s
book
Divine Dance of Love
(Princeton University Press), portrays Krishna's ability to dance with many maidens at once,
a metaphor for unconditional love and care.
<p><b>Writing and “Vision” in Journalism and Documentary Film </b>
<p>The magazine also develops a dialogue among writers, photographers and
documentary filmmakers, inviting readers to listen in as Pulitzer-Prize winning journalist
Jon Franklin debates with his colleagues online the viability of “vision” in their reported
nonfi ction. Documentary filmmaker Larry Engel discusses the “democratization of
documentary” as new technology enables the just about anyone to make a documentary
video.
<p>Like predecessor Points of Entry, the magazine will also continue to present new
and provocative work by scholars and those who do narrative journalism. The union of
DoubleTake and Points of Entry is a redoubling of each magazine's mission to contextualize
not only contemporary life within the liberal arts—connecting lived life to art, literature, for
instance—but to foster palpable connections to community and to provide room for emerging
writers and photographers.

<p>DoubleTake / Points of Entry is a print magazine-format journal published biannually
from its offices in the English department at Christopher Newport University,
in Newport News, Virginia and distributed through Johns Hopkins Press.
