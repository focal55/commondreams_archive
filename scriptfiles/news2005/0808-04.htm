<td colspan="2"><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON - August 8  - <strong>Citing CAFTA's NAFTA-like provisions, Greens warn
of damage from water privatization, lost jobs and
depressed wages, and blocked access to medicine.</strong></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Green Party leaders called
the House's recent passage of the Dominican
Republic-Central America Free Trade Agreement
(CAFTA) a disaster for working people in the
U.S., Central America, and the Dominican Republic
and the environmental health and safety in the
signatory nations.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;CAFTA will extend NAFTA's job loss, workers'
rights abuses, and environmental damage
throughout Central America,&quot; said Nan Garrett,
Georgia Green and Spokesperson for the National
Women's Caucus of the Green Party. &quot;It will
prohibit governments in the region from ensuring
that foreign investment serves national
development goals. Instead, it'll enable further
schemes for the profit of U.S.-based
corporations.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">CAFTA encourages nations to privatize and
deregulate services such as education, health
care, postal service, construction,
transportation, and the provision of water.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Privatization and deregulation have proved
particularly devastating for families living in
poverty,&quot; said Julia Willebrand, co-chair of the
Green Party's International Committee. &quot;In
Bolivia, forced water privatization resulted in
an economic breakdown when poor families were
forced to pay exorbitant fees to Bechtel, a
U.S.-based corporation. CAFTA will require the
officials in more than a third of Nicaragua's
municipalities to open water management to
bidding by transnational companies.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Greens note that CAFTA contains a provision
similar to NAFTA's Chapter 11, which allows
foreign corporations to sue national, state, and
local governments that pass strong labor, public
health, or environmental protections. Under the
provision, companies can bypass domestic courts
and sue a government directly for cash
compensation if they think an environmental or
public health law might interfere with their
ability to profit. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">CAFTA's &quot;data exclusivity&quot; provisions and
monopoly protections for brand-name drug
manufactureres threaten access to affordable
life-saving medicines in a region where half the
population live in poverty. According to the
World Health Organization and UNAIDS, more than
78,000 Guatemalans are HIV-infected; annual
AIDS-related deaths totaled 5,800 in 2003. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;CAFTA is modeled on NAFTA and other failed trade
policies, under which the U.S. trade deficit
reached a record $600 billion last year after
American companies relocated to take advantage of
lower wages and weaker worker and environmental
protections,&quot; said Jill Bussiere, Co-chair of the
Wisconsin Green Party. &quot;The NAFTA-related trade
deficit cost U.S. workers nearly 900,000 net jobs
through 2002. Companies that stayed in the U.S.
used the threat of leaving the country as a means
of breaking union organizing drives, and to win
concessions at the bargaining table.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Despite rosy predictions from supporters about
new jobs, NAFTA continues to harm workers in the
U.S. and Latin America. CAFTA will compound the
damage,&quot; added Jody Grage Haug, who lives in
Seattle, Washington and serves as co-chair of the
Green Party of the United States. &quot;Protests
similar to Seattle in 1999 may be necessary to
show widespread opposition to CAFTA, but it's
equally urgent that we remove the Republicans and
Democrats who voted for it from public office.&quot;</font></p>
