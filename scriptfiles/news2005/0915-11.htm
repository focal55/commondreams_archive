<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->WASHINGTON - September 15 -  Statement by Carl Pope, Sierra Club Executive Director

    <p>Tonight President Bush will be addressing the nation to share his
    administration's vision for rebuilding New Orleans and the other Gulf
    Coast communities that have suffered in the wake of Hurricane Katrina.
    It is the first of many opportunities for our government to rebuild
    trust with people who feel that this emergency was mismanaged.  Given
    the enormity of the task ahead, it is vital that the rebuilding process
    adhere to some common principles to ensure that the effort is not only
    efficient but also safe, just, and fair.

   <p>  I.  PUT PEOPLE FIRST
    The people who were hurt, suffered and were displaced must come first.
    The region should be rebuilt to meet their needs, and provide them with
    secure, prosperous and dignified lives. All must be welcomed back if
    they choose to return.

<p>II. INVEST IN THE LOCAL WORKFORCE AND ECONOMY
    Local workers and local businesses must be partners in the rebuilding.
    The disaster should not be used to drive down wages or salaries.
    Arguments of "efficiency" should not be used to channel the benefits of
    rebuilding to outside mega-firms. Existing prevailing wage, equal
    opportunity and small business safety nets should be respected, not
    shredded.  In addition, workers involved in the clean up, rebuilding
    and restart of industry must be adequately protected.

<p>III. DON'T SACRIFICE HEALTH AND SAFETY FOR SPEED
    The community must be safe and healthy for those who are going to live
    and work there. While speed is of the essence for the immediate
    draining and restoration of basic infrastructure, scientists -- not
    politicians or bureaucrats -- must be allowed to determine what it will
    take to make the cleanup and rebuilding safe for residents, including
    children, the elderly, and those at particular risk from toxins. In
    addition, workers must be involved in the clean up, rebuilding and
    restart must adequately protected.

<p>IV. REBUILD SMARTER AND BETTER
    The disaster revealed the many mistakes made in the development of New
    Orleans and other Gulf Coast communities over the last half century and
    more. In rebuilding, the lessons of these failures must be learned.
    Adequate transit must be provided; homes, buildings, and sewage systems
    designed to withstand future storms; and the latest building and energy
    conservation technologies adopted.  There's also a need to disarm time
    bombs that were not triggered by Katrina but still pose a threat in the
    future, including inadequate levees, substandard buildings, and
    uncleaned toxic waste dumps.

<p>V. PROMOTE RESPONSIBILITY TO THE COMMON GOOD
    Those whose practices put others at risk must not be allowed to repeat
    them.  Oil and gas operations that destroyed protective barrier
    wetlands; floating casinos that threatened shoreline communities when
    the storm surge hit; the storage and disposal of toxic materials in
    flood-plains and wetlands; shoddy construction practices; inadequate
    drainage requirements -- all of these must be firmly and resolutely
    ended.

<p>VI. REPAIR THE INEQUITIES OF THE PAST
    This disaster made it clear that nature is the great equalizer and
    knows no race or class and that our emergency response mechanisms are
    often discriminatory, with dire consequences for minority and
    low-income communities.  Our government needs to ensure that future
    emergency plans protect everyone, regardless of race and class.  It
    must also ensure that the rebuilding lifts up everyone equally and does
    not simply restore past injustices.
                                                                            
                                                                            
                                                                            

<p>VII. UPHOLD A MODEL OF DEMOCRACY
    The people of the Gulf Coast must be allowed to oversee and control the
    reconstruction and ensure that these principles are respected.
    Communities and workers that are not involved in decisions will be more
    exposed and vulnerable to future risks.  Transparency, accountability
    and public control are the most important key to success.

    for social, labor, housing, and civil rights issues addressed in the
    statement above.  (Note: All of these organizations has a strong
    presence in the impacted region and are involved in the recovery
    effort.)
