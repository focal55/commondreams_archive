<p>WASHINGTON - October 20 - Today as a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) panel votes on whether anti-bacterial products such as body washes and hand sanitizers are safe, Environmental Working Group’s (EWG) free online database, “Skin Deep,” lists 196 products containing the controversial chemical Triclosan from a database of 14,115 personal care products. Despite the fact that Triclosan, a pesticide, has been in widespread use in personal care products for years, the FDA is still raising basic questions about its safety, its effectiveness in preventing disease, its effects on the environment, and its potential to promote the development of resistant strains of bacteria.
 
<p>Products made with Triclosan include varieties of toothpaste made by Colgate and lip gloss made by Revlon.
 
<p>“Products we use every day on our bodies, and the ingredients that compose them, should be proven safe before they can be sold,” said EWG Vice President for Science Jane Houlihan. “Over three decades an industry-funded panel that reviews ingredients for personal care products has assessed just 11 per cent of the chemicals used in health and beauty aids. Don’t consumers deserve more than just 11 per cent protection?”
 
<p>EWG’s free, searchable “Skin Deep” database is viewable at <a href="http://www.ewg.org/reports/skindeep2/index.php" target="_new">http://www.ewg.org/reports/skindeep2/index.php</a>. 
 
<p>See the <a href="http://www.ewg.org/reports/skindeep2/search.php?nperpage=10&productscontain=1152&sort=&showall=1" target="_new">list of 196 products in “Skin Deep” containing the controversial chemical Triclosan</a>
