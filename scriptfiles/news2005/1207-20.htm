<p>NEW YORK - December 7 - The U.S. Secretary of State's 
statement yesterday about U.S. obligations under international law 
does not answer key outstanding questions about the treatment of 
detainees in U.S. custody, Human Rights Watch said today. 

<p>Speaking in Kiev yesterday, Secretary Condoleezza Rice said: "As a 
matter of U.S. policy, the United States obligations under the CAT 
[Convention against Torture], which prohibits, of course, cruel and 
inhumane and degrading treatment, those obligations extend to U.S. 
personnel wherever they are, whether they are in the United States or 
outside of the United States."   
  
<p>Secretary Rice did not respond to specific allegations that detainees 
have been held illegally in CIA detention facilities in Europe. She also 
failed to address rising concerns about specific U.S. interrogation 
techniques and torture practices such as waterboarding, which clearly 
violate the policy announced today.   
  
<p>"If the administration is serious about banning mistreatment, it should 
close secret prisons and get rid of waterboards," said Tom Malinowski, 
Washington director of Human Rights Watch. "If Secretary Rice 
means what she says, the Bush administration should drop its 
opposition to Senator John McCain's legislation, pending in the U.S. 
Congress, which would strengthen the legal prohibition against all 
cruel, inhumane and degrading treatment against all detainees, 
worldwide."   
  
<p>Human Rights Watch urged the Bush administration, and European 
governments, to cooperate with European inquiries about illegal 
transfers of detainees and secret prisons, and called on the United 
States to move "disappeared" persons into known detention facilities, 
articulate the legal basis under which the detainees are held, and allow 
access by independent observers.   
  
<p>Human Rights Watch also urged the administration to clarify Secretary 
Rice's announcement today that the United States is bound by 
international standards not as mere policy, but as a matter of law.   
  
<p>"The ban against cruel, inhumane or degrading treatment has to be 
more than a 'policy,' which can be changed by the president at any 
time," said Malinowski. "For months, Senator McCain has been asking 
for this international ban to be strengthened under U.S. law, and the 
administration should stop resisting his efforts."
