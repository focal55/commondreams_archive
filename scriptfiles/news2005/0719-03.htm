<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -  July 18  - A MADRE delegation returned today from Kenya, where Rose Cunningham&#151;an Indigenous Nicaraguan, longtime MADRE partner, and internationally-renowned human rights educator&#151;conducted workshops on human rights with Indigenous Samburu and Maasai women. The MADRE delegation also delivered donations of school supplies and teacher training materials to schools in rural, Indigenous communities.  </font></p><p> </p><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">MADRE partners with the Indigenous Information Network in Kenya to promote Indigenous Peoples&#146; and women&#146;s human rights throughout the country, including the environmental preservation and sustainable development of Indigenous lands. </font></p><p> </p><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As in other parts of the world, Indigenous Peoples in Kenya often live in extreme poverty without access to education and adequate health care, including HIV/AIDS treatment and prevention.  These conditions are worsened by economic and security policies of the Bush Administration, which exacerbate poverty and threats to women&#146;s human rights.  </font></p><p> </p><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Indigenous women&#146;s human rights are also under attack within their own communities.  Denied the right to own land, women are made more vulnerable to poverty and gender-based violence.  Yet, as those primarily responsible for preserving their Peoples' natural resources and traditional knowledge, Indigenous women hold the keys to combating poverty and creating strategies for sustainable development.</font></p><p> </p><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Vivian Stromberg, MADRE&#146;s Executive Director, commented: &#147;Our partners in Kenya are working to change the conditions of poverty that are perpetuated&#151;not eradicated&#151;by policies such as those recently championed by the G8.  Facing growing threats to their rights and resources, the Indigenous Information Network is working with MADRE to deliver life-saving information about HIV/AIDS treatment and prevention to Indigenous women and youth, and to demand Indigenous Peoples&#146; and women&#146;s human rights on local, national, and international levels.&#148; </font></p><p> </p><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To read MADRE&#146;s report, &#147;Make G8 Policy History: African Women&#146;s Rights and the G8,&#148; visit <a href="http://www.madre.org/articles/africa/g8.html" target="_new">http://www.madre.org/articles/africa/g8.html</a></font></p><p> </p><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Available for interviews:</font></p><p> </p><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Vivian Stromberg, Executive Director of MADRE, has worked for over 40 years as an activist in the international peace and justice movement.
