<p>WASHINGTON - November 9 - Today, by a narrow 25-23 vote, the House International Relations Committee rejected a Resolution of Inquiry, offered by Congressman Dennis J. Kucinich (D-OH) and co-sponsored by 106 Members of Congress, demanding all documents produced by the White House Iraq Group (WHIG).  

<p>The Kucinich Resolution (H. Res. 505) demanded that the White House turn over to Congress all white papers, minutes, notes, emails or other communications kept by the WHIG. Kucinich's resolution was supported by all Democrats at the committee hearing and Congressman Paul (R-TX) and Congressman Leach (R-IA). 

<p>After the vote, Kucinich issued the following statement: 

<p>"Congress has a Constitutional duty to provide oversight of the Executive Branch. Today the House International Relations Committee, once again, shunned this vital duty. 

<p>"We now know that the Administration hyped intelligence and misled the American public and Congress in their effort to 'sell' the war. This group, comprised of the President and Vice President's top aides, was critical in this effort.

<p>"Congress and the American people have a right to these documents, and a right to know the truth. 

<p>"This Congress can no longer pass the buck on accountability. With over 2,000 US troops killed in Iraq and tens of thousands more injured, it is long past time that this Congress wakes up and ask the serious questions that the American public is demanding answers to. 

<p>"Time after time this Congress has failed its Constitutional duty, and failed the American public. This Congress has become nothing more than a rubber stamp for this Administration and their policies.  We owe the American public better. That is what today's resolution was about."
