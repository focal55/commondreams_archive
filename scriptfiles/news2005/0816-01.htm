<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->WASHINGTON   - August 15 -  Progress for America – an organization that works to ensure the confirmation of ultraconservative activist judicial nominees – announced a misguided campaign to persuade senators to not hold thorough hearings on the nomination of John Roberts to the Supreme Court.

 

<p>People For the American Way President Ralph G. Neas issued the following response:

 

<p>“When there is a consensus nominee with a well known judicial philosophy, the Senate Judiciary Committee hearings are often relatively brief and there is no need for extensive and detailed questions.  But when a nominee is not a consensus choice and/or does not have a well known judicial philosophy, the Senate Judiciary Committee hearings must be much more comprehensive and the questioning much more detailed.
<br>
<br>
“Like Sandra Day O’Connor, Ruth Bader Ginsburg was a consensus nominee.  The top Republican senator on the Judiciary Committee, Orrin Hatch, told President Clinton that Ginsburg was acceptable before she was even nominated.  In addition, she had a long and detailed record from her time as a federal judge.  In her case, there was no need for extended hearings.
<br>
<br>
“Even so, in her hearings, Justice Ginsburg did answer questions about issues such as her position on the right to privacy and a woman’s right to choose.  Progress for America’s claims to the contrary are blatantly false.

 


<p>“But that’s beside the point.  The Roberts nomination is entirely different from the Ginsburg nomination.  John Roberts is not a consensus nominee.  His record from his time as federal judge is severely limited.  His records from the years he spent as a political appointee in the White House and solicitor general’s office are being slow-rolled or withheld altogether.  There are parts of his record that are still hidden from view, and apparently the White House and its far-right allies want it to stay that way.  One can only wonder what they’re trying to hide.”
