<p>WASHINGTON — Human Rights Campaign President Joe Solmonese made the following statement on the passing of legendary civil rights leader Rosa Parks.

<p>“With one simple yet extraordinary action, Rosa Parks made our nation a better and fairer place for all Americans. By insisting on the dignity and respect every human being deserves, Parks boldly moved the country toward fairness. Parks didn’t stop on the bus, but kept going, working throughout her life to make the world a better place. With her passing, a true legend is lost but an inspiring imprint will always remain.”

<p>The Human Rights Campaign is the largest national lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender political organization with members throughout the country. It effectively lobbies Congress, provides campaign support and educates the public to ensure that LGBT Americans can be open, honest and safe at home, at work and in the community.
