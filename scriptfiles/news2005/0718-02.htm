<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - July 15  - Today the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit decided that Environmental Protection Agency was not required to regulate carbon dioxide emissions from cars.  The decision has no effect on state efforts, such as California's landmark law to curb global warming pollution from passenger vehicles, which contribute 40% of America's greenhouse gas emissions.</font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In response to today's ruling, Sierra Club attorney David Bookbinder said, &quot;We wish that the Bush administration would take this issue as seriously as California, other states, and the rest of the world.  Ignoring the reality of global warming won't make it go away and won't deter state and local efforts to support cleaner technologies that reduce carbon pollution.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Background:</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Today's case began in 1999, when various environmental groups filed an administrative &quot;rulemaking petition&quot; requesting that EPA set motor vehicle emission standards for four heat-trapping pollutants, including carbon dioxide.  That petition was still pending in 2001 when President Bush abandoned his campaign promise to regulate greenhouse gas emissions and declared that global warming pollutants were not &quot;air pollutants&quot; that could be regulated under the Clean Air Act.  EPA formalized that position in August of 2003, when the agency denied the pending rulemaking petition. At that time, EPA also stated that - as a policy matter - it would not set motor vehicle emission standards even if it had authority.  In October of 2003, 30 different parties -- including 16 states or other governmental entities and 14 environmental groups -- challenged EPA's decision.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">California still maintains the need and ability to curb global warming pollution from cars.  The state, having exercised its authority under the Clean Air Act to pass stricter laws to curb pollution than the federal government, is already requiring automakers to begin reducing carbon emissions from passenger vehicles by 2009, and several other states are lining up to follow California's lead.</font></p><p></p><p></p><p align="CENTER"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">###</font></p><!-- #EndEditable -->
