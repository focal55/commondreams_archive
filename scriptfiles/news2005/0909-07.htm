<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->ACCRA, Ghana - September 9 - Civil society groups from West Africa 
met in Accra today, just two weeks after the construction of the West 
African Gas Pipeline (WAGP) began off the Ghanaian coast.

<p>The groups warned that the pipeline project and the so-called WAGP Treaty seriously undermine the national sovereignty of Ghana, Togo, 
Benin and Nigeria and subvert these countries' rights to seek 
alternative energy options. At the same time, the project enshrines the 
energy monopoly of oil giants Chevron and Shell in the region.

<p>The groups maintain that the pipeline project risks prolonging ongoing 
conflicts in the oil and gas-rich Niger delta in Nigeria.

<p>Representatives from communities living near the pipeline route in Nigeria and Ghana report that they have not been properly consulted, 
suggesting that the World Bank, one of the main project financiers with 
its 40 million USD guarantee, may be violating its own commitment to 
invest only in projects that have broad community support.

<p>According to Asume Osuoka of Friends of the Earth Nigeria/Environmental 
Rights Action in Nigeria, "The compensation1 available to displaced 
community people in Nigeria is a mockery, as low as USD 20. This 
constitutes a gross violation of livelihood security."

<p>The West African Gas Pipeline, one of the region's largest 
trans-boundary investments, is projected to cost 617 million USD and 
will ultimately transport gas from Nigeria through Benin and Togo to Ghana.

<p>The World Bank and project sponsors like Shell and Chevron claim that 
the pipeline will contribute to putting an end to dangerous gas flaring 
in Nigeria, that it will provide cheap energy, and that it will promote 
regional integration.

<p>However, to date there is no evidence to supports these claims, 
according to Friends of the Earth International, the world's largest grassroots environmental federation.

<p>Gas flaring, the burning of natural gas associated with oil extraction, 
has gone on for decades in the Niger Delta despite the fact that it is a human rights, environmental and economic disaster [1].

<p>Shell, Chevron and the World Bank claim that the West African Gas Pipeline will channel away 'associated gas' from existing Nigerian oil fields where it is now burned, but environmentalists are unconvinced.

<p>According to Asume Osuoka of Friends of the Earth Nigeria/Environmental 
Rights Action in Nigeria, "In the current plans, there is no evidence of 
the intention to capture associated gas from existing oil fields, which 
leads us to believe that gas would be sourced from new gas fields and 
increase existing problems in the Niger Delta."

<p>In Nigeria, 66% of the population lives below the poverty line and the 
benefits of nearly half a century of oil production have flowed almost 
exclusively to oil multinationals and corrupt local elite.

<p>Civil society representatives also do not believe that the pipeline 
would provide cheap energy or promote regional integration.

<p>According to Noble Wadzah of Friends of the Earth Ghana, "The West African Gas Pipeline contracts lock our country into a long-term costly energy supply. The ordinary Ghanaian citizen or small business may not 
be able to access this energy, which is primarily destined for large 
businesses."

<p>Some Ghanaians think that long-time tensions in the Niger Delta would 
render the gas supply unreliable.

<p>"Gas coming from the Niger Delta, an area of social conflicts and environmental tragedies, could hardly be the basis for the sound 
integration of our region. This project is more likely to foster 
regional disintegration and social and political tensions in West 
Africa," said Noble Wadzah.

<p>"Energy must be available not just for the elite and industry, but also 
for everyone else who needs it, especially rural communities," he added.
