<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">PORT ANGELES, WA -- January 10  -- Who has an appetite for shrimp or prawns? Would their taste be so keen if they knew that shrimp production contributed to the high death tolls and destruction from the recent tsunamis that devastated Asian coastlines.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Just imagine all those tourists who relaxed in their rented beach bungalows, watching lazily as the sun rose on that fateful morning of Dec. 26th in Phuket, Thailand. That same beach front was once surrounded by an offshore fringe of healthy coral and sea grass beds that meshed with mangrove forests that once protectively lined the shore. But this was all torn out to make way for the resorts and seaside getaways, leaving tourists and locals alike unaware of the grave dangers they were in.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The severity of the current tsunami disaster is beyond comprehension. Yet, the tsunami's force could have been greatly lessened and much loss in life averted had healthy mangrove forests, coral and sea grass beds been conserved along these same, now devastated coastlines.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Instead these vital protective buffers that nature provides against wind and wave had been foolishly destroyed for unsustainable developments such as industrial shrimp aquaculture, tourism and urban expansion into these now quite vulnerable coastal regions.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Today, less than half the world's mangrove forests remain--around 16 million ha. There is ample scientific evidence that shows that these coastal ecosystems protect coastlines. One study shows that the destructive force from tsunami waves as high as 15 meters is greatly dissipated as they pass through intact, healthy coastal zones containing mangroves.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to a report from India areas of the coast of the southern state of Tamil Nadu that had dense mangrove forests suffered fewer human casualties and less property damage compared to areas without mangroves. In many places where the devastation was greatest, there were few or no remaining mangroves.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Reportedly, on the Indonesian island of Simeuleu near the earthquake's epicenter, only four people were killed when the tsunami struck. The island residents attribute this to their still intact mangrove forest, which greatly diminished the strength of the waves.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Mangrove Action Project has Regional Offices in Thailand, Indonesia, and Caribbean</i></font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
