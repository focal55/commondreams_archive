Common Cause is also in the process of making its own short documentary highlighting the problems of the last presidential election.</font></p><p align="LEFT"> </p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The clip, entitled &quot;<a href="http://www.commoncause.org/site/pp.asp?c=dkLNK1MQIwG&b=562403" target="_new">Never Forget November 2nd</a>,&quot; can be viewed by clicking here.
