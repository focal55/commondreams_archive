<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The runoff election in Iran's presidential race, coming up this Friday, 
  has profound implications for the future. </font>
</p>
<ul><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>SIMIN ROYANIAN</b>, <a href="mailto:ciwhr@yahoo.com">ciwhr@yahoo.com</a>
   <br> Royanian is co-founder of <a href="http://women4peace.org/" target="_new">Women for Peace and Justice in Iran</a>. She said 
today: "President Bush had proclaimed the elections in Iran undemocratic 
and a hoax from the beginning. ... Mr. Bush, by claiming that the Islamic 
Republic has no legitimacy, undermined the attempts of the reformist 
candidates at opening the possibility of normalization of relations. The 
people of Iran demonstrated that they are involved in deciding their 
destiny and they are a force to be reckoned with. The fact that the votes 
were spread among the candidates, necessitating a runoff, is another sign 
that the voters were not forced into voting for one pre-selected candidate. 
The result of the runoff election next Friday is very important since the 
frontrunner Rafsanjani promotes more liberalization and attempts to 
normalize U.S./Iran relations, while the second candidate represents the 
hardliners with no interest in open dialogue."

  <br>  Ehsani is a research scholar at the University of Illinois-Chicago. He 
is on the editorial boards of Middle East Report and Goft-o-gu (Dialogue) 
journal in Iran, and he is the author of a number of articles about Iran. 
Ehsani said today: "Despite some irregularities the election results in 
Iran probably show an accurate map of the political opinion in the country. 
These results show that conservative forces have managed to put together an 
effective nationwide political machine that consistently delivers voters. 
However, by the same token, the conservative vote has a maximum ceiling. As 
reformers, moderate conservatives, and formerly apathetic voters flock to 
support Rafsanjani against a 'fundamentalist' alternative, chances are that 
Rafsanjani will win with a strong hand, by posing as the savior of the 
nation against the dual threats of domestic extremism, and an effective 
international statesman able to neutralize the external military threats of 
the United States."

in Tehran for 10 days until yesterday. He spoke with hundreds of Iranians 
spanning the political and economic spectrum, including voters, reform 
activists, and Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, the front-running presidential 
candidate. Solomon said today: "The Bush administration has been eager to 
dismiss the Iranian presidential election as meaningless, even though the 
election has included significant elements of democracy. The White House 
seems to be primarily interested in setting an agenda for military 
confrontation." Solomon is the author of the new book "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0471694797/commondreams-20/ref=nosim" target="_new">War Made Easy: How 
Presidents and Pundits Keep Spinning Us to Death</a>."
