<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- February 9 -- Budget cuts will inevitably create a hemorrhaging because they take away services from some while ending the jobs of others.  In short, budget cuts result in budget bludgeoning.  Those who are on the chopping block are those who have no lobbyists or language that is effective enough to avert any attacks on their economic existence. We are increasing spending on defense yet cutting programs that benefit those we are trying to defend.  Poverty is the worst form of terror and if our concern is about violence at home and aboard, then poverty should be chief among our thoughts. A budget that is aimed at slashing support for the nation's most vulnerable is terribly inconsistent with a nation that just finished a value-driven election and furthermore cannot be squared with the principles of compassion.  Slashing of social programs that give support to the many coupled with tax cuts that give riches to the few runs amuck of our Judeo-Christian heritage.  <br><br>In a nation that has already lost its identity in red and blue distinctions, we now  precariously toward losing our moral soul in rich and poor divisions.  It will be difficult to pull the nation into a harmonious whole when 110 million Americans either live on a lonely peninsula of poverty or are within a few paychecks of its shores while others enjoy the benefits of a nation drowning in material prosperity.  <br><br>If there is any rare consolation, it is that the national media is starting to push out of hiding the faces of America's poor. Articles about poverty continue to spill out across the country's newspapers reminding the nation that a war on poverty is still being fought and the need for the nation to turn its attention to this new form of terrorism.  It is this media attention, though limited now, that has placed the nation on a direct course to eliminate poverty within the next decade.  Such a statement seems odd in light of the federal budget, but Victor Hugo is right-nothing is more powerful that an idea whose time has come.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Based in Washington, DC, the Community Action Partnership is the national association representing the interests of the 1,000 Community Action Agencies (CAAs) organized to change people's lives, embody the spirit of hope, improve communities, and make America a better place to live.
