<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">NEW YORK / GENEVA - July 26 - In the wake of a report by the United Nations Special Envoy regarding home demolitions and evictions in Zimbabwe, UNICEF today repeated calls for an immediate end to the operation and for full humanitarian access to more than 585,000 people who have been made homeless.
</font><P></P><P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">UNICEF said it was horrified at reports of children dying of easily treatable respiratory infections and of women being forced to give birth in the open.</font></P><P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Two months ago the Zimbabwe Government embarked on a nationwide “clean up” of its cities. The result has been the mass destruction of tens of thousands of homes, loss of livelihoods, and a particularly devastating impact on children. </font></P><P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">“There is understandable outrage about what is happening to children in Zimbabwe,” said UNICEF Executive Director Ann M. Veneman.&nbsp; “More than 220,000 children are homeless, without access to food, water or health care. Tens of thousands of children are no longer in schools.”</font></P><P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Secretary-General’s Special Envoy, who spent two weeks assessing the situation in Zimbabwe, released a report Friday that said Zimbabweans “are today deeper in poverty, deprivation and destitution,” adding that many sick women and children, and hundreds of people living with HIV, no longer have access to health care services.</font></P><P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">What UNICEF is doing in response to the emergency:</font></P><UL>
