<p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- May 10 -- The Corporation for Public Broadcasting wants to have greater control over all PBS programming.  Despite its statutorily limited role in content, the GOP-dominated CPB board fashioned a &#147;National Programming Service Agreement&#148; that would have give it unprecedented influence and power over PBS&#146;s programming schedule.  CPB regularly provides modest annual funding to PBS to help support its National Programming Service (NPS).  For the current contract period  (FY 2005-2006), CPB has earmarked slightly more than $26 million to help pay for some of the primetime and children&#146;s shows on PBS.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But for the first time in the 14-year history of the NPS agreement, CPB made a series of legal demands designed to reshape PBS programming to its own conservative and non-journalistic ideological perspectives.  According to the contract, CPB wanted PBS to agree that its programming would be governed by its own sponsored research and analysis&#151;called the &#147;CPB Needs Assessment Research and Analysis.&quot;  CPB&#146;s goal was to secure an ideological &quot;straitjacket&quot; over what should be the editorial independence of PBS programmers. </font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to the agreement sent to PBS, each year CPB would &#147;conduct, and convey to PBS documents describing key findings and conclusions of, research and analysis necessary to determine public and audience service needs.&quot;  CPB would send such material to PBS &#147;on an ongoing basis throughout the year.&#148;  In addition, CPB insisted that &#147;at its discretion&#148; it would conduct additional studies and a &#147;comprehensive system-wide needs assessment.&#148;  One of its stated goals for this research was to help identify &#147;&#133;what good television programming can provide&#133;.&#148;  PBS would be required to use this research in formulating its national programming plans. </font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The &#147;good programming&#148; intended by CPB, of course, is a PBS schedule bereft of serious journalism and independent programming.  One can only imagine the kind of TV schedule CPB Board Chairman Ken Tomlinson and his cronies fancy--one dominated by programs where Paul Gigot and Michael Medved meet the ghost of Lawrence Welk at an &#147;Antique Roadshow.&#148;  Or--since Tomlinson is part of the upper-class pony set of the Virginia countryside--a show starring the talking horse Mr. Ed, spewing forth on trickle-down economics and private retirement accounts.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In what must be a clear violation of its mandate not to be involved in programming decisions, CPB demanded that PBS supply it annually with a list of the national programs to be made, detailing how each reflected its research.  CPB could disapprove using its funds for any individual program it did not find &#147;acceptable.&#148;</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CPB also pressured PBS to formally change the network's own journalistic standards.  It gave PBS a deadline of June 30, 2005 to &#147;develop and adopt revised standards and guidelines&#148; that were intended to undermine the production of investigative and other serious journalistic programming.  Each program might be required to be &#147;objective and balanced,&#148; thus eliminating investigative reporting and point of view documentaries.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In a private memo distributed to PBS executives, the network's vice president and deputy general counsel described the proposed CPB contract as intruding &#147;upon PBS&#146; editorial independence and integrity&#133; and indicates a desire to control the content of all PBS programming.&#148;  Thankfully, PBS president Pat Mitchell refused to sign the contract.  A less onerous version was agreed to in April 2005, one that PBS believes doesn&#146;t compromise editorial integrity.  But CPB&#146;s leaders still intend to control content on public broadcasting, including the use of its research.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CPB board chair Ken Tomlinson has recklessly politicized CPB.  Instead of overseeing an independent agency with a mandate to promote public broadcasting, he has abused his power to promote a narrow, self-serving agenda.  Tomlinson must resign.  His replacement should be a chair with an allegiance neither to Republicans nor to Democrats--but to serving the American public.</font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
