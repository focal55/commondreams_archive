<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WEST PALM BEACH, FL -- February 10  -- Today many of healthy horses, yearlings and foals will begin their journey to one of the three equine slaughterhouses where they will meet with a cruel and heinous death. Many people are still not aware horses are slaughtered in the US and have no idea of the cruelty involved.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Horses are sensitive, intelligent and compassionate creatures willing to run or work their hearts out to please us? They should not be crammed into trailers, denied food and water for long periods of time. They should not be unloaded at slaughterhouses with whips and electric prods into kill chutes. The captive bolt gun shot repeatedly into their flailing heads bring &quot;screams&quot; from their bodies never heard before by humane animal caregivers. Not to mention the ones that are NOT rendered unconscious and are awake as their throat is being slit, the vivisection beginning while they still breathe and their hides skinned from their body while they hang shackled form their hind legs. The mother and foal who once grazed in the grass side by side loving each other and happy to just be together, wonder what cruel twist of fate caused them to be hanging side by side enduring this excruciating pain as the life bleeds out of their body. The real story of the slaughterhouse is rarely told since the mask of secrecy is hardly ever revealed.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Pure Thoughts Inc. / Foal Rescue Foundation an all-volunteer 501(c)3 non-profit organization is dedicate to saving the lives of these precious animals through their nationwide adoption program for horses, yearlings and foals. They are coordinating a nationwide effort to save these and many more from an untimely and horrible fate. Last year over 200 foals and horses were saved in just our Florida facility and this year with the introduction of training &amp; placement facilities, expansion of the organization into a nationwide association and the growing amount of awareness and support over the slaughterhouse Pure Thoughts Inc / Foal Rescue Foundation estimates that thousands of foals, yearlings and horses will find happy homes and avoid the slaughter house. They are here to make sure the animals end in a happy home and a productive life rather that a torturous death at the slaughterhouse. These foals yearlings and mares are good sound equines that will go on to be excellent Sport Horse prospects (jumping, dressage, Western, English, etc.), trusty trail riders, or just faithful companions.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Over 50,000 horses are slaughtered each year; good horses, yearlings and foals are heinously slaughtered, enduring hours sometimes days of tortuous conditions so that they may be shipped overseas for human consumption. The slaughterhouses are in Texas and Illinois and all are foreign owned companies.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">These horses, babies and yearlings need love, care, medication, and a 'forever' home. Pure Thoughts Inc / Foal Rescue Foundation needs help -- especially in the form of donations. All donations are tax deductible. These yearlings and foals need hay, grain, supplements, medical care, farrier (blacksmith) attention, and mostly love.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It is only through publicity that people can become aware of the fate of these poor unwanted animals and realize that there are people who care and are doing something about it. It is only through donations of money, time, goods and services that relocation and placement can work. It is heart-wrenching when there are 10 and you only have the funds for 5, those eyes looking at you begging for their life, the mothers and foals wondering why they are being ripped apart when their life together has just begun. As the mares are hauled away, their hearts broken, their bodies flailing in despair at the loss of their baby and there they are in the back of a truck without food or water on their way to the slaughterhouse unaware that as horrible as their life seems right now...it is about to get worse. The foals stay behind, crying for their mothers, wondering who will take care of them, who will love them, how will they live.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There is a large group that has broken ground on making sure that scenes like this fade and are replaced with these beautiful equines in loving homes, trail riding through the woods, competing in many different equitations. Help will open up this opportunity to more horses, yearlings and foals and help put an end to demise of an innocent life. Please give some coverage and attention to this human/animal interest story. Please contact a representative from the national board today to see how to help.</font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
