<p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- May 17 -- At various Embassies around the world today, representatives of the World Tribunal on Iraq (WTI) delivered law summons and letters inviting US President Bush and UK Prime Minister Blair to the culminating session of the World Tribunal on Iraq to be held in Istanbul between 23-27 June, 2005. The letter of invitation is signed by leading international figures including Corrine Koumar, Denis Halliday, Prof. Richard Falk, Ken Coates and Hans von Sponeck (1).</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In several Capitals around the world including Istanbul, Brussels, Tokyo and Lizbon the Embassies of the United States and the United Kingdom were the targets of the WTI representatives delivering law summons reading &#147;Mr. Bush you are being called to attend the World Tribunal on Iraq in Istanbul&#148;. The activists also presented letters to the Embassy officials (2). In addition, letters were also sent by post in New York, Stockholm, Manila and Amsterdam to the US and UK officials.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In Istanbul, following the giving of the letter to a US Embassy official who came out to meet the group, Ms. Hilal Kuey, the spokesperson for the WTI in Turkey, said &#147;Since the US administration does not recognize the International Criminal Court (ICC) and the UK government has used its power to avoid being prosecuted for an illegal and illegitimate war, the citizens of the world have undertaken an initiative to reclaim justice. The world is calling for Bush and Blair to be held accountable for the crimes committed in Iraq.&#148;</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The World Tribunal on Iraq (WTI) is a worldwide undertaking to reclaim justice. It aims to record the severe wrongs, crimes and violations that were committed in the process leading up to the aggression against Iraq, during the war and throughout the ensuing occupation, that continue to be widespread to this day. The project consists of commissions of inquiry and sessions held around the world investigating various issues related to the war on Iraq, such as the legality of the war, the role of the United Nations, war crimes and the role of the media as well as the social, political, environmental and cultural devastation.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On June 23rd to the 27th 2005, at the start of the third year of the occupation of Iraq, the culminating session will take place in Istanbul. This session will reach a decision following an examination of the results of the previous sessions as well as new reports and testimonies, while evaluating the implications of the aggression against Iraq for the world at large.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;We ask Mr. Bush and Blair to present their case in front of the jury of concience in Istanbul. We believe that the Istanbul hearing bears the responsibility of culminating a process already initiated, and of initiating a process yet to be imagined.&#148; concluded Mrs. Kuey.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i><b>Notes:</b></i></font></p><p><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">1-The letter is signed by the following people;<br>Richard Falk - Prof. of International Law, University of Santa Barbara,<br>Ken Coates - Chairman, Bertrand Russel Peace Foundation, former European Parliament Member<br>Baskin Oran - Prof. of International Relations, Faculty of Political Sciences, University of Ankara<br>Nadje Al-Ali - Dr. of Social Anthropology, University of Exeter<br>Joel Kovel - Prof. of Social Studies, Bard College<br>Denis J.
