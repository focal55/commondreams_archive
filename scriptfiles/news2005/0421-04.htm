<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- April 21 -- House Energy Committee members received $166,028 from energy producers in the first quarter of this year with more than three-quarters going to Republicans, according to a report released today by the Campaign for America&#146;s Future. The contributions were discovered as the House began considering an energy bill that includes $8 billion in tax breaks for energy and chemical companies but does nothing to ease rising gas prices.</font><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Data from the Center for Responsive Politics cited in the report shows that the energy and natural resource industries gave almost $350 million to federal candidates and political parties since 1990, 70 percent to Republicans. They contributed more than $50 million in the last election cycle alone with 75 percent going to Republicans.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Campaign for America&#146;s Future Deputy Director Ellen Miller said the massive contributions are a clear example of the corruption rampant in this Congress.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;Everyday people are paying for political corruption at the pump,&#148; said Miller. &#147;Rep. Barton can&#146;t act in the public interest when his pocket is full of money from special interests.&#148;</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Energy Committee Chair Rep. Joe Barton, R-Texas, received $34,000 from energy companies, including oil giants Exxon Mobil, Shell, Marathon and Sun Oil. Halliburton contributed $2,000 to Rep. Barton&#146;s campaign committee.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">House Majority Leader Tom DeLay, R-Texas, the driving force behind the bill in Congress, received $43,500 since the beginning of the year from energy companies. Rep. DeLay received more than $1 million from energy and natural resource interests since 1989.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Among the top contributors to committee members are the Exelon Corporation and Southern Company, two of the largest electric utilities in the nation, which gave $21,000 and $3,500 respectively.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To read the Campaign for America's Future report, please click <a href="http://www.ourfuture.org/docUploads/2006_energy_bill_charts.pdf" target="_new">here</a>.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>The Campaign for America&#146;s Future (CAF) is a center of progressive strategy, organizing and issue campaigns.
