<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->WASHINGTON - September 14 -<EM>  Statement of NOW President Kim Gandy</EM>
<P>September 14, 2005</P>
            <P>Yesterday Senator Arlen Specter said of John Roberts' answers 
            during his confirmation hearing for Chief Justice of the United 
            States: "They may be misleading, but they are his answers."</P>
            <P>No kidding! Despite reports to the contrary, I heard no 
            indication, much less a commitment, from the nominee that he would 
            protect women's rights and civil rights or the holdings of <EM>Roe 
            v. Wade</EM>.</P>
            <P>As a lawyer, I have been listening very carefully, and what we 
            I've heard is a very clever attorney who has avoided answering many 
            key questions by filibustering [Senator Joe Biden's description] and 
            doing the testimonial equivalent of reading the phone book.</P>
            <P>One thing is clear: This nominee is prepared to go to great 
            lengths to appear to say one thing, while leaving himself open to 
            explain the same words differently at a later time. </P>
            <P>For example, when asked about <EM>Roe v. Wade</EM>, Roberts said 
            that Roe is a precedent that is "entitled to respect under 
            principles of <EM>stare decisis</EM>," but of course that is true of 
            every precedent . . . right up to the moment it is overturned. He 
            used the same phrase repeatedly to describe nearly every case about 
            which he was asked. </P>
            <P>Of course, all cases are entitled to respect in our judicial 
            system, but in legal parlance "respect" simply means recognition, 
            and does not have the same implications of high regard as the common 
            usage of the word. </P>
            <P>Roberts did discuss the grounds on which he would consider 
            overruling an existing decision, but he refused to respond to 
            questions as to whether those same grounds would apply to 
            <EM>Roe</EM>. </P>
            <P>This is quite different from saying that Roe was correctly 
            decided, as some thought they heard. Roberts was quite willing to 
            say that <EM>Griswold v. Connecticut</EM> &#8212; which allowed married 
            couples to use contraception &#8212; was correctly decided, but he was 
            careful to note that it was based on "marital privacy," which is 
            different from the "personal privacy" rights on which <EM>Roe</EM> 
            and <EM>Eisenstadt v. Baird</EM> (contraception for single women) 
            were based. Indeed, Roberts flatly refused to agree with or refute a 
            statement made in the <EM>Rust v. Sullivan</EM> brief, of which he 
            was a co-author, that "<EM>Roe</EM> was wrongly decided and should 
            be overturned." </P>
            <P>Roberts in fact appears to be laying out a roadmap for how he 
            would overturn <EM>Roe</EM>. As grounds for overturning precedent, 
            he cited both "extensive disagreement" and whether a core holding 
            has become "unworkable," both of which are very common arguments 
            made by the right-wing for overturning Roe. Additionally, by 
            repeatedly turning to <EM>Casey v. Planned Parenthood</EM> while 
            addressing <EM>Roe</EM>, Roberts suggested erosion of the precedent 
            as additional grounds, since Casey significantly eroded the 
            <EM>Roe</EM> protections and reasoning, as has subsequent state and 
            federal legislation. </P>
            
<P>We urge senators on the Judiciary Committee to press this nominee 
            to actually answer the questions posed to him, and not accept 
            circular logic and non-answers. Women deserve to know whether this 
            judge would protect our most basic rights. If John Roberts cannot 
            support <EM>Roe v. Wade</EM>, he must be rejected.
