<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON, June 1 /U.S. Newswire/ -- The following was released today by MoveOn PAC:

<p>-- Radio Ads, Constituents to Hammer 7 Vulnerable GOP Reps for Ties to Scandal-Ridden Tom DeLay

<p>-- Call on Reps to Give Back 'Dirty Money' Received from Majority Leader

<p>-- Over 400,000 and Rising Petition Signatures Delivered to District Offices Demanding Congress Fire DeLay for Abuses of Power

<p>Members of the grassroots organization MoveOn PAC, will take part in a national campaign to persuade seven politically vulnerable House Republicans to fire their scandal-mired Majority Leader, Tom DeLay. Constituents will gather at the congressional members' district offices with a "Fire DeLay" petition while MoveOn runs radio spots in their districts.

<p>The initial congressional members targeted in the campaign include, Rep. Melissa Hart (PA-4), Rep. Dave Reichart (WA-8), Rep. Chris Chocola (IN-2), Rep. Rob Simmons (CT-2), Rep. Mike Sodrel (IN-9), Rep. Heather Wilson (NM-1) and Rep. Marilyn Musgrave (CO-4).

<p>The campaign comes as a civil court in Texas ruled Thursday that one of DeLay's political committees, Texans for a Republican Majority (TRMPAC), violated Texas campaign laws when it failed to disclose over a half-million dollars in corporate contributions.

<p>"Tom DeLay is a bad, bad man. A court has ruled that part of DeLay's empire is illegal. It's time for members of Congress to stop the abuse of power and fire Tom DeLay," said Tom Matzzie, MoveOn PAC Washington Director.

<p>This month, MoveOn circulated a "report card" to its members in GOP congressional districts nationwide, including data from the independent watchdog group Public Campaign Action Fund, showing that House Republicans have accepted $2,140,605 in campaign contributions from a DeLay PAC and then voted for DeLay as Republican majority leader. Constituents will call on these representatives to return the "dirty money."

<p>'Stench" (Musgrave, CO-4)

<p>MOPR-307

<p>Unless you're driving, put your nose a little closer to the radio. Smell that? It's the stench of corruption coming from Congressman Tom DeLay, the Republican leader in Congress.

<p>He's already been nailed three times for ethics violations. Now, he's accused of misusing money from his children's charity and taking expensive overseas trips paid for by lobbyists.

<p>And, you know why we can smell this abuse of power all the way out here in Colorado? Because our Representative, Marilyn Musgrave, voted for DeLay to lead the Republican Congress and took $20,000 in donations from him.

<p>Call Marilyn Musgrave and tell her to wash the stench away by firing Tom DeLay. You can reach Marilyn Musgrave at 970-352-4037.
