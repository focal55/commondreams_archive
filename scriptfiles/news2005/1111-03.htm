<P>WASHINGTON - November 11 - House Democratic Leader  Nancy Pelosi and Rep. Henry Waxman, ranking member on the  Government Reform Committee, sent a letter this morning to  Harriet Miers, counsel to the President, requesting that she  provide Congress with documents relating to lobbyist Jack  Abramoff's request for $9 million to arrange a meeting between  President Bush and Omar Bongo, president of Gabon.</p>
<p>   Below is the text of the letter:</p>
<p>   November 11, 2005</p>
<p>    Ms. Harriet Miers<br>
Counsel to the President<br>
The White House<br>
1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW<br>
Washington, D.C. 20500</p>
<p></p>
<p>   Dear Ms. Miers:</p>
<p>   Yesterday's New York Times reported that President Bush met  with Gabon's President Omar Bongo in May 2004, ten months after  lobbyist Jack Abramoff asked President Bongo for $9 million to  arrange such a meeting.  Mr. Abramoff's offer and the size of the  requested payment raise questions about what role Mr. Abramoff  may have played in the scheduling of this meeting between  President Bush and President Bongo.</p>
<p>   We are writing to request that you provide us with all White  House and State Department documents and correspondence regarding  the arrangement of the meeting.  </p>
<p>   According to the Times, a draft agreement between Mr. Abramoff  and Gabon dated August 7, 2003, asked for $9 million in lobbying  fees to pay for a &quot;public relations effort related to promoting  Gabon and securing a visit for President Bongo with the President  of the United States.&quot;(See note 1)  The Times reports that this  draft agreement came just 10 days after Mr. Abramoff wrote to  President Bongo on July 28, 2003, suggesting that &quot;he had unusual  influence to arrange a meeting with President Bush.&quot;  In that  letter, Mr. Abramoff noted:  &quot;Without advance resources, I have  been cautiously working to obtain a visit for the president to  Washington to see President Bush.&quot;  </p>
<p>   White House spokesman Trent Duffy told the Times that  arrangements for the visit by the President of Gabon were not  unusual and went through &quot;normal staffing channels.&quot;  However, it  is impossible for Congress and the public to assess this  assertion without access further documentation from the White  House.  </p>
<p>   We therefore request the following documents:  </p>
<p>   -- All records relating to any contacts or communications  between White House staff and Jack Abramoff, the firm Greenberg  Traurig, and the firm GrassRoots Interactive regarding a visit by  representatives of Gabon.</p>
<p>   -- All records relating to any contacts or communications  between the State Department and Jack Abramoff, the firm  Greenberg Traurig, and the firm GrassRoots Interactive regarding  a visit by representatives of Gabon.</p>
<p>   -- All records relating to any direct contacts or  communications between White House staff and representatives of  Gabon.</p>
<p>   -- All records relating to any direct contacts or  communications between the State Department and representatives  of Gabon.</p>
<p>   We request that you provide these materials by November 30,  2005.</p>
<p>    Sincerely,</p>
<p>   Nancy Pelosi, House Democratic Leader</p>
<p>   Henry A. Waxman, Ranking Member, Government Reform Committee</p>
