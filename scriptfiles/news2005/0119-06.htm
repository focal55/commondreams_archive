<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- January 19 -- The nation&#146;s leading advocacy organization for women&#146;s medical privacy announced that more than 26,000 Americans have sent a direct message to the Food and Drug Administration asking the agency to approve greater access for women to the &#147;morning-after pill,&#148; an emergency contraceptive that significantly reduces a woman&#146;s chance of becoming pregnant after sex or sexual assault.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">NARAL Pro-Choice America President Nancy Keenan announced the results of the organization&#146;s two-week grassroots effort during a conference call with reporters.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;As the President takes the oath of office for the second time, he should know that Americans don&#146;t want his administration to block women&#146;s access to an essential contraceptive that will reduce unintended pregnancies. Americans want the FDA to follow the recommendation of doctors and scientists who overwhelmingly say women should have access to the morning-after pill,&#148; Keenan said. &#147;We are waiting to see which group the FDA listens to. It&#146;s either the medical community and a majority of Americans who want to give women greater access to an emergency contraceptive that reduces unintended pregnancies or the extreme right-wing interests within the Bush Administration that are trying to undermine women&#146;s medical privacy.&#148;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Keenan said the messages varied in content but all urged the FDA to follow the recommendation of its scientific and medical advisers and allow over-the-counter before its self-imposed deadline of Thursday, January 20&#151;which coincides with President Bush&#146;s second inauguration.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Keenan was joined by Dr. James Trussell, a NARAL Pro-Choice America Foundation board member who served on the physicians&#146; panel that recommended FDA grant the petition for increased access to the emergency contraceptive.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;We&#146;re asking the FDA to pay attention to the science,&#148; Dr. Trussell said. &#147;The other side&#146;s arguments are simply ideology, not science.&#148;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The messages came from all 50 states and the District of Columbia. Although the FDA set the arbitrary deadline of January 20, Keenan encouraged the public to go her group&#146;s web site, <a href="http://www.prochoiceamerica.org/" target="_new">www.prochoiceamerica.org</a>,  where they would find a link enabling them to send a message to the FDA.</font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
