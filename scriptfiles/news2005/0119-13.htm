<p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- JANUARY 19 -- Green Party presidential candidate will speak for the majority of Americans at DC counter-inaugural activities David Cobb, the Green Party's 2004 presidential candidate, will be speaking at two counter-inaugural rallies on Thursday, January 20, in Washington, DC, refuting the notion that President Bush has a mandate to bomb civilians in Iraq or spy on law-abiding citizens in the U.S.&quot;President Bush has lied to the American people time and time again and he's lying to himself if he thinks he has a mandate to govern--31% is not a mandate,&quot; said Cobb.According to recently released figures, Mr. Bush won 50.8% of the popular vote from the 60.7% of eligible voters who actually cast ballots.  Seventy eight million eligible voters did not vote for any presidential candidate.  More people abstained from voting than the number who voted for Mr. Bush. </font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The Green Party speaks for the majority of Americans.  Most people want an end to the war in Iraq and to bring our troops home safely as <br>soon as possible.  Most people believe that everyone in this country is entitled to a Living Wage, health insurance and affordable housing.  Most people believe in the Bill of Rights and the Constitution and are offended by the so-called &quot;Patriot Act&quot; and Bush's war on our civil liberties.  Only when our voting system is improved and people are able to vote their conscience and know that their votes will be counted, will our government reflect the views of the people,&quot; said Cobb. As part of a wide range of counter-inaugural activities taking place in the nation's capital, Cobb will be speaking Thursday at a 9 a.m. rally in Malcolm X Park, 16th and Euclid Streets NW, sponsored by the DC Anti-War Network.  Cobb will then speak at a rally at MacPherson Square Park, 15th and I Streets NW, at approximately 11 a.m.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Information about additional counter-inaugural events, the <br>Cobb-LaMarche campaign's role in the Ohio recount, and the New Voting Rights Movement can be found at <a href="http://www.votecobb.org/" target="_new">http://www.votecobb.org</a>.
