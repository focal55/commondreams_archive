<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->NEW YORK - November 2 - As Congress considers new 
legislation reinforcing the ban on cruel, inhuman and degrading 
treatment, a new book illuminates the practice of torture around the 
world and examines how recent policy shifts in the United States have 
undermined the global ban on torture.

<p>Called "required reading" in the November issue of Vanity Fair, 
Torture: Does It Make Us Safer, Is It Ever OK? is an up-to-the-minute 
exploration of this wrenching topic. Now available in bookstores, the 
book is published by the New Press and Human Rights Watch.   
  
<p>Revelations of torture and degradation at Abu Ghraib and other U.S. 
detention facilities have galvanized both proponents and opponents of 
torture.   
  
<p>"Who would have thought we would still be debating the use of 
torture?" said Kenneth Roth, executive director of Human Rights 
Watch and co-editor of the book. "But when a government as 
dominant and influential as the United States openly defies the 
absolute ban on mistreating detainees, its conduct jeopardizes 
prisoners everywhere."   
  
<p>In this new book, essays by leading thinkers and experts cross 
continents and centuries to offer a timely exploration of the global 
debates on torture—the legality of the practice, the extent of its use, 
the pain it inflicts and its questionable effectiveness.   
  
<p>In his contribution to the book, former prisoner of war Senator John 
McCain argues against throwing out the Geneva Conventions' 
prohibitions on torture. Last month, in a 90-9 vote, the U.S. Senate 
approved a measure sponsored by Republican Senators John McCain 
and Lindsey Graham that would, contrary to Bush administration 
policy, prohibit the military and CIA from using "cruel, inhuman, or 
degrading treatment" for any detainee in U.S. custody anywhere in the 
world.   
  
<p>In his introduction, Human Rights Watch executive director Kenneth 
Roth sets out how the shifting U.S. position has undermined the global 
prohibition on torture. Tom Malinowski reveals how the U.S. is 
engaging in practices that its own State Department regularly 
condemns when performed by other governments around the world.   
  
<p>In other chapters, Michael Ignatieff counters Alan Dershowitz's 
controversial "ticking time-bomb" scenario as a justification for using 
torture, and Israeli human rights advocate Eitan Felner spotlights 
Israel's failed experiment legalizing the mistreatment of detainees in 
supposed emergency situations.   
  
<p>British barrister Cherie Booth writes about sexual violence and the 
torture of women. Sir Nigel Rodley, the former United Nations torture 
rapporteur, tells of his experiences negotiating with torturers 
worldwide.   
  
<p>Juan Méndez, U.N. special advisor on genocide prevention, writes for 
the first time about his own horrific experience of torture. Argentine 
Consul General Héctor Timerman gives a harrowing account of the 
Argentine military dictatorship's torture of his father and the impact 
this had on his family.   
  
<p>"For a number of the writers in this book, torture is not an abstract 
concept," said Minky Worden, media director of Human Rights Watch 
and co-editor of the book. "These voices and perspectives will lead 
even the staunchest backers of torture to question their beliefs."
