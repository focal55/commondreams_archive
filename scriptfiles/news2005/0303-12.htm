<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- March 3 -- Today, The Interfaith Alliance deplored the House passage of HR 27, the Job Training Improvement Act, which rolls back 40 years of civil rights and religious liberty progress by allowing a religious test for federally-funded jobs. This legislation is another example in the growing and ongoing assault on the First Amendment's religious liberty guarantees. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">H.R. 27 represents a dramatic shift in government policy towards religion by repealing the language protecting people of faith and goodwill from religious employment discrimination. The original law, including the protections, was signed into law by President Ronald Reagan in the Job Training Partnership Act. Since 1982 this program has been the largest Federal employment training program in the nation, serving dislocated workers, homeless individuals, economically disadvantaged adults, youths and older workers. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The Interfaith Alliance urged members of Congress to support an amendment to HR 27 by Rep. Bobby Scott of Virginia that would have restored civil rights protections,&quot; Gaddy said. &quot;Unfortunately, that amendment was defeated. TIA opposed the bill without the Scott Amendment as an unjustified assault on religious liberty and civil rights protections. America's unemployed citizens and those who wish to train them should not be subjected to a religious test under a federal program.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Under this legislation, religious organizations would be empowered with federal dollars to put up signs saying &quot;No Catholics, No Baptists, No Jews, No Muslims, No Presbyterians, No Methodists, No Episcopalians May Apply,&quot; Gaddy said. <br> <br>&quot;Passage of this legislation is part of an orchestrated effort on numerous fronts by some politicians and some religious leaders to establish one narrow view of Christianity as the favored religion of the United States government,&quot; said the Rev. Dr. C. Welton Gaddy, President of The Interfaith Alliance, and a Baptist minister. &quot;They want to ignore or delete the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the Constitution by saying the Constitution guarantees freedom OF religion but not freedom FROM religion. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Just this week, at a Washington conference on faith-based initiatives, President Bush outlined his agenda to continue his administration's repeal of religious liberty and civil rights guarantees. Also this week, House Majority Leader Tom DeLay declared that the Constitution does not guarantee separation of church and state,&quot; Gaddy said. &quot;But how can we have freedom of religion if we don't have freedom from having someone else's religion imposed on us by government?&quot; </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In another assault on religious liberty, HR 235, the Jones Bill, seeks to convert houses of worship into partisan political organizations, endorsing political candidates while remaining tax-exempt. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Efforts to enact into law the president's illegal faith-based executive orders would sanction the spending of tax-payer dollars to proselytize those in need and to base hiring on a religious test. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to an April 2001 Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life poll, 78 percent of Americans oppose allowing government-funded religious organizations to hire only those who share their religious beliefs. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>The Interfaith Alliance (TIA) is a nonpartisan, grassroots organization dedicated to promoting the positive and healing role of religion in the life of the nation and challenging those who manipulate religion to promote a narrow, divisive agenda. With more than 150,000 members drawn from more than 75 faith traditions, and 47 local alliances, TIA promotes compassion, civility and mutual respect for human dignity in our increasingly diverse society. <a href="http://www.interfaithalliance.org/" target="_new">www.interfaithalliance.org</a> </i></font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
