<td colspan="2"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON <!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->- September 21 - A coalition of national security whistleblowers - including Able Danger's Lt. Col. Anthony Shaffer - is critical of whistleblower protection legislation that House Government Reform Committee Chairman Tom Davis (R-VA) has scheduled for a committee markup tomorrow. Underscoring the obstacles whistleblowers face, the news media reports that the Pentagon has blocked testimony from Able Danger whistleblowers who had been slated to appear before the Senate Judiciary Committee today. According to AP, Able Danger was &quot;a secret military unit that identified four 9/11 hijackers more than a year before the Sept. 11 terrorists attacks, according to the man's attorney.&quot;<!-- #EndEditable --></font>
<p> </p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sibel Edmonds, president of the newly formed National Security Whistleblowers Coalition made this statement: &quot;Chairman Davis and his staff have continued to disregard our requests for a Government Reform Committee hearing to discuss badly needed provisions that would apply to whistleblowers from the intelligence and law enforcement communities. Considering the unprecedented number of national security whistleblower cases since the 9/11 terrorist attacks, it is appalling to see that the Chairman of the House Government Reform Committee refuses to extend protections to those courageous individuals coming forward.&quot; </font></p>
<p> </p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The legislation to be marked up tomorrow has already been controversial. Whistleblowers and watchdog groups allege that Chairman Tom Davis mounted a sneak attack when he secretly inserted a provision on the bill aimed at exempting homeland security whistleblowers from protections. The provision was discovered days before the last markup and was criticized by labor unions as well as other Republicans on the committee such as Representative Christopher Shays (R-CT). As a result, Congressman Todd Platts (R-PA) introduced a new version of the bill (H.R. 3097) which took out the controversial homeland security exemption.</font></p>
<p> </p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">After that flare up, Chairman Davis promised hearings in the Summer, and then in the Fall, that would allow national security whistleblowers to testify about the challenges they face. Those hearings were never scheduled.</font></p>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At the Committee hearing tomorrow, it is expected that several amendments may be offered which would do much to improve the situation for the national security whistleblowers. </font></p>
<p> </p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The National Security Whistleblowers Coalition and the Project On Government Oversight are asking that the legislation include: --Whistleblower Rights for Employees of Intelligence Agencies and Federal Contractors - currently, intelligence agencies and most federal contractors are exempt from whistleblower protections.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">--Protection of Classified Disclosures to Congress - whistleblowers like Lt. Col Anthony Shaffer have no protection from retaliation or inappropriate legal enforcement action by the Executive Branch if they disclose classified information to Congress. The result is that the Executive Branch has carte blanche to determine what information is given to Congress, even though the courts have given Congress an undisputed right to receive classified information in its role of overseeing the government. --Security Clearances - the Senate Government Affairs Committee recently approved legislation (S. 494) that would provided protections for employees who have their security clearance revoked.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- All Circuits Review - the Senate Government Affairs Committee also approved language on the same bill that would allow any federal court to hear whistleblower appeals, ending the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit's exclusive jurisdiction over whistleblower appeals. </font></p>
