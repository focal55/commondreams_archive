<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- March 15 -- Today, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) participated in a Congressional Ethics Coalition news conference calling on the House of Representatives to restore the ethics committee's ability to enforce the House ethics rules and standards.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Melanie Sloan, executive director of CREW spoke earlier today about the need to re-establish the now-defunct ethics committee. &quot;Shady and possibly illegal conduct of a number of members of Congress such as Mobster-in-Chief Tom DeLay, and others with close ties to lobbyist Jack Abramoff, including Representatives John Doolittle, J.D. Hayworth and Bob Ney, will go un-investigated and unpunished if the House does not put an end to the impasse over ethics The American public has the right to expect that Congress - - charged with policing the conduct of its members -- will do so.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In addition, CREW called upon members of both parties to vote in favor of Minority Leader Pelosi's Privileged Resolution to establish a bipartisan ethics task force that would make recommendations to restore public confidence in the ethics process.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Members of Congress need to be held accountable for their actions. Without an ethics committee, some members will abide by only the rules they seem to care about -- their own.&quot; Melanie Sloan said today. &quot;We ask that the House take up Congressman Mollohan's Resolution to roll back the Republican rules changes to the ethics committee immediately to place ethics, and not partisanship, as a priority in the people's House. &quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Copies of Melanie Sloan's statement from the news conference toda are available at httP://www.citizensforethics.org or by contacting Naomi Seligman by phone at 202-588-5565 or <a href="mailto:press@citizensforethics.org" target="_new">press@citizensforethics.org</a>.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) is a non-profit, progressive legal watchdog group dedicated to holding public officials accountable for their actions.</i></font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
