<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON  - July 21  - Today, Rep. Bernie Sanders voted against the USA Patriot Act reauthorization bill after the Republican leadership denied members of Congress the opportunity to vote on critical changes to the bill, including an amendment offered by Sanders. The reauthorization act passed 257 to 171. Sanders&#146; amendment, which would have restored Americans&#146; constitutionally guaranteed right to read and access information without governmental intrusion or monitoring, was denied a vote on the floor by a ruling of the Republican-controlled House Committee on Rules.  This amendment was substantively identical to the amendment Sanders offered and the House approved in June as part of the Justice Department appropriations bill. Sanders&#146; June legislation passed with overwhelming bipartisan support, with 199 Democrats and 38 Republicans voting in favor of the amendment. </font><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sanders said, &#147;The Republican leadership&#146;s decision to subvert the will of the majority of House members by preventing a vote was an absolutely unconscionable abuse of power. The House voted overwhelmingly just a few weeks ago to approve this very same legislation. Instead of respecting the will of the American people and their Representatives in Congress, the Republican leadership has made a mockery of our democratic rights by denying Congress a vote.&#148;</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sanders&#146; amendment would have revised section 215 of the Patriot Act to prevent federal agents from accessing American&#146;s reading records from bookstores and libraries without first obtaining a search warrant or grand jury subpoena. Sanders&#146; previously-passed appropriations amendment effectively makes these same changes for the year-long life of the spending bill. The passage of this amendment as part of the Patriot Act reauthorization would have made these safeguards permanent. </font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In addition to eliminating Sanders amendment, the House&#146;s Republican-authored Patriot Act Reauthorization bill failed to substantively revise several other of the Patriot Acts most controversial sections. These include Section 213, which allows the FBI to search the homes and belongings of American citizens without notifying them of the search, and Section 505, which allows the FBI to obtain Americans&#146; financial records without a judge&#146;s approval. The bill also eliminates 14 of the 16 sunsets originally placed in the law that allow Congress to review the bill and ensure the federal government is not abusing the expansive powers granted under the act.</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sanders said, &#147;Our government must be vigorous in fighting the scourge of terrorism and protecting the American people, but it is critical that we do this without undermining the basic constitutional rights that makes us a free country. The bill that was forced through today by the Republican leadership does very little to address the widespread concerns the American people have about some of the most invasive sections of the Patriot Act. Instead of conducting a thorough review, the Republican leadership chose to silence debate by denying Congress a vote on some of the most critical sections of the act.&#148; </font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sanders will continue to work with members of the Senate to make sure the Patriot Act amendment passed to the Justice Department spending bill will be made into law. The Senate Judiciary Committee today also released a Patriot Act reauthorization bill that requires more stringent guidelines for federal officers exercising 215 orders than those provided in the House bill. </font></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p align="CENTER">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
