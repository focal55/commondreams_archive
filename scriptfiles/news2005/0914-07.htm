<B>New York Times Ad Attacks John Bolton&#8217;s UN Agenda

Anti-Poverty, Environmental and Women&#8217;s Groups Denounce Bolton/Bush

With the opening of the 
World Summit in New York that was supposed to address global poverty and 
strengthen the United Nations, global organizations fighting poverty, global 
warming and war are outraged at the Bush administration&#8217;s attempts to derail the 
Summit. <BR>
<BR>
A New York Times full-page ad by the anti-poverty group Global 
Exchange, which will appear in Wednesday&#8217;s paper and will be distributed to the 
international delegations attending the Summit, highlights US Ambassador John 
Bolton&#8217;s bullying tactics (see text below). <B>A teleconference on Wednesday, 
September 14 at 11 am EST </B>will give reporters access to anti-poverty, 
environmental, peace and women&#8217;s groups who will critique Bolton&#8217;s positions and 
how out of touch they are with the efforts of the global community. They will 
also denounce the US refusal to fulfill previous commitments to alleviate 
poverty and the US myopia, in the wake of Hurricane Katrina, to seriously 
address the crisis of global warming. <BR>
&nbsp;<BR>
<B>New York Times ad partial 
text (view full ad at www.globalexchange.org):<BR>
</B><BR>
&nbsp;&#8220;Bush&#8217;s human 
wrecking ball has hit the United Nations. His mission: to make the UN over in 
the image of the Bush-Cheney administration. While talking &#8220;reform&#8221; Bolton has 
demanded change to the international agreement that 175 countries, including the 
United States, had painstakingly negotiated over the past year: Oppose 
cooperation on global warming. Take out references to &#8220;corporate 
accountability.&#8221; Dilute the call for &#8220;participation and representation&#8221; of 
women.<BR>
&nbsp;<BR>
&#8220;&#8230; Bolton has even tried to force language into the 
agreement that would reward Bush-Cheney contributors. Pharmaceutical companies 
would reap higher profits from price protections on drugs sold to the poorest 
people with AIDS. Energy companies and other polluters would profit from 
undermining efforts to reduce global warming.&#8221;<BR>
