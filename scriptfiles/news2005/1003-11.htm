<p>WASHINGTON - <EM>Statement of NOW President Kim Gandy</EM>
<P>George W. Bush's nomination of White House Counsel Harriet Miers 
            to serve as Associate Justice of the Supreme Court raises important 
            questions for women's rights supporters. While we are pleased that 
            Bush chose a woman for the High Court, her judicial philosophy is 
            more important than her gender. Miers' potential as a justice is 
            unknown at this point. </P>
            <P>What we do know about Miers is that she is a Bush loyalist, 
            having worked closely with him since at least 1993. With this 
            nomination, Bush has raised to new heights his fondness for 
            promoting close confidantes, like Dick Cheney and Alberto Gonzales, 
            to top positions. </P>
            <P>If confirmed, Miers would fill the seat of retiring Justice 
            Sandra Day O'Connor, who was the key swing vote to preserve the 
            basic protections of <EM>Roe v. Wade</EM>, to require a health 
            exception to state-level abortion restrictions, to allow affirmative 
            action in college admissions, and to protect Title IX's promise of 
            equal educational opportunities for women and girls, among many 
            others.</P>
            <P>After careful consideration of O'Connor's record and judicial 
            philosophy, NOW testified in support of her confirmation in 1981. 
            While she was a conservative, O'Connor did support basic human 
            rights and liberties that transcend the often rigid labels of 
            "liberal" or "conservative."</P>
            <P>It remains to be seen where Miers stands on those and virtually 
            every other issue. She has no paper trail and has never served as a 
            judge &#8212; quite simply, her future conduct on the Court may be 
            impossible to determine. Should the Senate confirm someone to a 
            lifetime appointment with so little information? We think not. NOW 
            urges the Senate to ask tough questions, insist on answers, and 
            refuse to confirm this nomination unless they can establish that 
            Miers supports the fundamental rights of women.</P>
            <P>The rights of women and girls are on the line; too much is at 
            stake to confirm a stealth nominee to the Court. </p>
