<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- January 6 -- Parents, Families and Friends of Lesbians and Gays (PFLAG) today publicly announced the results of the PFLAG National Schools Assessment launched in January 2004. Unlike other assessments that evaluate the school climate -- that is how safe or unsafe students feel -- the PFLAG assessment evaluated the education system's response to the needs of gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender (GLBT) students by measuring the existence and implementation of policies to protect GLBT students and resources to support them.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">While the assessment indicated a growing awareness of GLBT safe schools issues, results also showed critical deficiencies in support for GLBT youth. Some important findings include:</font></p><ul><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">95 percent of school counseling services had little or no gay, lesbian or bisexual resources</font></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 99 percent of school counseling services had little or no transgender resources</font></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 70 percent had no training for educators/staff on how to stop GLBT bullying</font></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 92 percent had no training for students on how to stop GLBT bullying</font></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 84 percent had little or no resources for parents about GLBT issues</font></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 59 percent did not include gay, lesbian or bisexual students in their harassment/non-discrimination policies</font></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 75 percent did not include gender identity/expression in their harassment/non-discrimination policies</font></li></ul><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Our findings help explain why so many people still hold on to damaging old fictions and profound misunderstandings about our GLBT family members and friends,&quot; said Ron Schlittler, PFLAG's executive director. &quot;Misinformation goes unchallenged because accurate information is virtually banned in our schools.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;For the sake of all of our kids and our communities,&quot; Schlittler continued, &quot;it is time to face up to this problem with honesty and compassion and address it through anti-harassment policies, accurate resources and training for staff and faulty. It is simply the right thing to do.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Schlittler also commended students for their promotion of safe schools. &quot;There are encouraging signs. Nearly 39 percent of respondents reported the existence of support groups for gay and straight students that address the needs of GLBT students. PFLAG regularly receives requests for help from students trying to start Gay-Straight Alliances in their schools. Sadly, however, these students are often the only members of school communities pressing for avenues to acknowledge and address their needs. Parents, community members and professional educators need to take responsibility as well. PFLAG stands ready to help.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">PFLAG's National Schools Assessment was developed by PFLAG's safe schools staff and researchers at the University of Maryland. The respondents came from 39 states. 65 percent of respondents were professional educators and 30 percent were students. Jason S. Zack, Ph.D., Behavioral Science Consultant and Adjunct Assistant Professor at the University of Miami analyzed the assessment responses.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Of the study Dr. Zack stated, &quot;The results of the 2004 Safe Schools Assessment provide a fascinating snapshot of the state of PFLAG Safe Schools policy implementation across the U.S. In responding to questions about their schools' demographics, policies, environment and their own demographic information, participants have helped to establish both a sense of what has been achieved thus far, and a road map for the work yet to come. The data collected in the present study offers a baseline for future PFLAG Safe Schools research.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Parents, Families and Friends of Lesbians and Gays (PFLAG) is the nation's foremost family-based organization committed to the civil rights of gays, lesbians, bisexual and transgender persons. Founded in 1973 by mothers and fathers, PFLAG has over 250,000 members and supporters in more than 500 chapters throughout the United States.</font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
