<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- May 19 -- Kenneth Tomlinson is a very busy man, holding down the board of directors chairs at two US government-connected agencies.&nbsp; While better known outside the Beltway for his role as chair of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, Mr. Tomlinson also oversees the U.S&rsquo;s official propaganda arm&mdash;the <a href="http://www.bbg.gov/bbg_aboutus.cfm" target="_blank">Broadcasting Board of Governors</a> (BBG). He has served as chair and member since August 2002. </font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As chair of BBG, Tomlinson oversees all &ldquo;U.S. government and government sponsored (non military) broadcasting,&rdquo; reaching more than 100 million people each week.&nbsp; Among the outlets run by BBG are the <a href="http://www.voanews.com/english/portal.cfm" target="_blank">Voice of America</a> (which Tomlinson used to run), <a href="http://www.martinoticias.com/" target="_blank">Radio and TV Marti</a> (broadcasting to Cuba), and a host of Middle East services, including <a href="http://www.radiosawa.com/english.aspx" target="_blank">Radio Sawa</a>, <a href="http://199.239.255.9/" target="_blank">Alhurra</a> (&ldquo;a commercial-free Arabic language satellite TV channel&rdquo;) and <a href="http://www.radiofarda.com/en_default.aspx" target="_blank">Radio Farda</a> (aimed at Iran&rsquo;s Persian-language audience).&nbsp; Tomlinson sees the U.S. government international media effort as &ldquo;our most effective means of public diplomacy aboard and a critical component of the Global War on Terror.&rdquo; (<a href="http://www.bbg.gov/_bbg_news.cfm?articleID=124&mode=general" target="_blank">http://www.bbg.gov/_bbg_<br>news.cfm?articleID=124&amp;mode=general</a>)</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Tomlinson&rsquo;s choice for CPB president--Patricia Harrison, the Acting Under Secretary of State for Public Diplomacy and Public Affairs--is also playing a major Bush Administration role in shaping the U.S. global media (and news) apparatus. As reported May 1, 2005 by the <em>New York Times</em>, Mr. Tomlinson &ldquo;has made clear to the board&rdquo; that he wants Ms. Harrison, who is also a former co-chair of the Republican National Committee, to replace Kathleen Cox (who was terminated by Mr. Tomlinson and his colleagues after only serving a few months).&nbsp; Ms. Harrison has worked closely with Tomlinson&rsquo;s BBG to develop the administration&rsquo;s post-9/11 &ldquo;Public Diplomacy&rdquo; strategy.&nbsp; </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But the efforts of Mr. Tomlinson and Ms. Harrison to actively shape public perception of the US abroad are exactly the wrong qualifications to lead CPB.&nbsp; CPB is not supposed to promote the official position of the U.S. government.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s role is to support public TV and radio&rsquo;s efforts to provide serious journalism, in-depth opinion, and a wide-range of cultural and community programming.&nbsp; Yet Ms. Harrison&rsquo;s expertise is clearly focused on the manipulation of public opinion.&nbsp; As she noted before Congress, &ldquo;[M]edia in all of its forms, from the Internet to print and broadcast, is an important component of public diplomacy.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp; She has said that &ldquo;[T]elevision and video products &hellip; are &hellip; powerful strategic tools for bringing America&rsquo;s foreign policy message to worldwide audiences.&rdquo;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In testimony before the House International Relations Committee on August 19, 2004, Ms. Harrison spoke of the post-9/11 government plan to use &ldquo;all the tools of technology&rdquo; &hellip; to &hellip; &ldquo;increase understanding for American values, policies and initiatives.&rdquo;&nbsp; This work has included strong U.S. financial and technical support to produce programming, including &ldquo;documentary productions&rdquo; and what she calls &ldquo;good news stories on reconstruction in Iraq and Afghanistan&hellip;.&rdquo;&nbsp; She described how the U.S. is &ldquo;helping Arab and Muslim journalists produce balanced reports and documentaries.&rdquo;&nbsp; Using services similar to Video News Release distributors in the U.S., Ms. Harrison said the government is working with the <a href="http://www.hearstcorp.com/interactive_media/property/int_prop_thenewsmarket.html" target="_blank">NewsMarket</a> service to help distribute &ldquo;our products to more than 2,000 broadcasters and news agencies worldwide&rdquo; (and which &ldquo;provides routine monitoring and placement reports&rdquo;).&nbsp; She also talked glowingly of new programs targeted at &ldquo;youth influencers,&rdquo; including education ministers, classroom teachers, coaches and parents. (<a href="http://mumbai.usconsulate.gov/wwwhwashnews2318.html" target="_blank">http://mumbai.usconsulate.gov/<br>wwwhwashnews2318.html</a>)</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In testifying before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee two weeks after then Secretary of State Colin Powell laid out the U.S. case for the Iraq war, Tomlinson called it &ldquo;beyond doubt among the most important statements in the war on terrorism, one that everyone in the world needed to hear.&rdquo;&nbsp; We now know, of course (and many did then), that Mr. Powell had not real facts--just U.S.-inspired falsehoods--as the basis for his arguments.&nbsp; On the CPB board at the time, Tomlinson&rsquo;s endorsement illustrates how incapable he is of making independent editorial judgments.&nbsp; CPB is not a government propaganda agency, although surely that is the intention of Mr. Tomlinson and its proposed president Ms. Harrison.&nbsp; Mr. Tomlinson has, to put it kindly, conflated his role as America&rsquo;s Propagandist-in-Chief with the running of what is supposed to be a non-governmental agency that &ldquo;most effectively assures the maximum freedom&rdquo; of public broadcasters.&nbsp; He has spent his time manipulating CPB to advance a narrow ideological agenda. (<a href="http://www.iraqwatch.org/government/US/HearingsPreparedstatements/us-sfrc-tomlinson-022703.htm" target="_blank">http://www.iraqwatch.org/government/US/Hearings<br>Preparedstatements/us-sfrc-tomlinson-022703.htm</a>) </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Mr. Tomlinson has a serious conflict of interest.&nbsp; He should resign from CPB.&nbsp; Nor should Ms. Harrison be endorsed as the next CPB president.&nbsp; The position requires someone whose background indicates real support for an independent public broadcasting service.&nbsp; </font></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Links</font></h2><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><a href="http://www.cpb.org/" target="_blank">Corporation for Public Broadcasting</a></font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><a href="http://www.bbg.gov/index.cfm" target="_blank">Broadcasting Board of Governors</a></font></p><center>###</center><!-- #EndEditable -->
