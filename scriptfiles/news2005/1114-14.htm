<p>NEW YORK - November 14  - To demonstrate the importance of exposing children to human rights at an early age, Academy Award®-winning actress Jennifer Connelly will present 700 copies of author Joy Berry’s latest children’s book, Mine & Yours: Human Rights for Kids (powerHouse kids; 48 pages; $8.95), to the New York City public school system at an Amnesty International USA (AIUSA) event on November 16*.  The event marks the official start of a collaborative project that will incorporate the use of Mine & Yours in elementary schools nationwide. 

<p>At the event, Dr. William Schulz, executive director of AIUSA, and Ms. Berry will lead a brief interactive program on human rights and responsibilities with third graders from P.S. 1 in the Bronx.  Ms. Connelly, ambassador for AIUSA’s Human Rights Education program, will encourage educators and parents to engage in similar activities with their children.  At the end of the program, the children will perform “Mine and Yours,” one of the songs from the project’s accompanying CD, with world music group Chris Berry & Panjea. 

<p>“Creating a new generation that has an inherent respect for human dignity is perhaps one of the most effective means of preventing human rights abuses in the decades to come,” said Dr. Schulz. “Mine & Yours is a vital means of encouraging children to realize their potential as agents of change.  We are grateful for Joy Berry’s contribution to human rights and to Jennifer Connelly for her generous donation to New York City public schools.” 

<p>Added Ms. Connelly:  “I welcome the opportunity to bring attention to this critical effort and help create a global human rights culture for our kids." 

<p>Mine & Yours is the first instructional book on human rights for young children.  Written to complement and benefit AIUSA’s Human Rights Education program, the book includes illustrations by award-winning artist Nicole Richardson. It is part of a larger educational initiative for primary school students, including the 13-song CD, a teachers’ guide and curriculum materials, a calendar and DVD. One hundred percent of the author’s royalties will go directly to the Human Rights Education Program of AIUSA 

<p>“Of all 250 self-help books that I have written for children, none is more important than Mine & Yours,” said author Joy Berry.  “This book teaches children the human rights that are the cornerstone of all personal and social responsibility.” 

<p>Learning about human rights is the first step toward building a culture that respects and defends human dignity.  It should begin with young children, in classrooms, learning communities and at home, and continue as a lifelong learning process. Through providing resource materials, as well as training and networking opportunities, AIUSA's Human Rights Education Program offers both a lens for children to observe the world and a methodology for them to teach and lead others. 

<p>The New York City launch of Mine and Yours will mark the beginning of a series of AIUSA sponsored events in cities across the United States.  Events will include book signings, library readings and musical performances.  AIUSA will continue to promote the book through its Human Rights Education and Children’s Human Rights networks during the next year. 

<p>“Human rights education creates a positive value system,” said Karen Robinson, Director of AIUSA’s Human Rights Education Program. “Learning about human rights principles at a young age not only contributes to a child’s understanding of the world and how it works, but also helps children to develop into self-respecting, assertive and open-minded adults who incorporate these principles into their lives and the lives of others.”
