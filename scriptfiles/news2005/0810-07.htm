<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> SAN FRANCISCO - August 10 - Progressive Democrats of America (PDA) achieved impressive victories last weekend at the annual convention of Young Democrats of America (YDA). The official youth arm of the Democratic Party, YDA has now officially ratified a resolution in support of the Resolution of Inquiry on the Downing Street Memo introduced on June 11 to the U.S. House of Representatives by Congresswoman Barbara Lee (D-CA) as well as a resolution to end the U.S. occupation of Iraq. PDA National Political Director Kevin Spidel mobilized progressives inside the YDA convention to get these measures passed.</font>
<p> </p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">YDA has more than 45,000 members in 780 chapters across 43 states. As such, YDA has considerable influence on the Democratic National Committee.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Spidel attended the YDA convention as both a delegate from Arizona to the YDA Platform Committee and on behalf of PDA. Through his leadership, YDA modified its language and platform planks to more accurately reflect the strong progressive movement within that body.</font></p>
<p> </p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Text of the progressive resolutions passed by YDA are attached.<br>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A RESOLUTION TO END THE U.S. OCCUPATION OF IRAQ<br>
Submitted by the Arizona Delegation<br>
Sponsored by: California Delegation, Colorado Delegation, Illinois Delegation, Maryland Delegation, Massachusetts Delegation<br>
</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Whereas the Bush Administration, using false intelligence estimates, misled the country into an illegal, unnecessary and unwise invasion and occupation of Iraq, a country that had neither attacked nor posed an immediate threat to the United States, thus jeopardizing our national security; and<br>
</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Whereas the invasion and occupation have created a severe burden on our economy, stretched the capacity of our armed forces including Reserve and National Guard troops who are serving unexpectedly long and difficult tours in Iraq, and continues to cause deep concern at home and abroad about the policies and intentions of the United States to the point where the United States is widely regarded with suspicion, hostility and distrust, and elections in Iraq confirmed that Iraqis wish the United States to withdraw;<br>
</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Whereas the actions of the United States of America in Iraq show that the United States wishes to establish permanent military bases in Iraq, in violation of Iraqi sovereignty;<br>
</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Whereas more than 2000 US soldiers have been killed, thousands of US soldiers wounded, and untold thousands of Iraqi citizens killed, wounded or made homeless in the continuing conflict in Iraq;</font></p>
<p> </p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Whereas more than 150 billion dollars have been spent for the Iraq occupation and, over the next year, the continuing occupation will take at lest an additional 81 billion dollars away from priorities at home;<br>
</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Whereas our occupation or Iraq fuels the insurgency, which prolongs the destruction of Iraqi communities and infrastructure;<br>
</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Therefore be it resolved that the Young Democrats of America</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Show solidarity with State Democratic Parties of California, New Mexico, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Wisconsin, whereby similar resolutions have been passed declaring an end of this occupation, <br>
We show solidarity with our brothers and sisters of labor united under the AFL-CIO which additionally passed a similar resolution supporting an end to this occupation, <br>
Supports our troops by recognizing the brave sacrifices they have made in the name of defense; understanding that political decisions urged by the Bush Administration has lead us to the current situation in Iraq, and that the soldiers in combat and support missions are not the focus of opposition against this occupation here at home, <br>
Support Democratic leaders such as Rep. Barbara Lee who is working toward legislation opposing the continued military occupation of Iraq vis-&agrave;-vis military bases, <br>
Support our Democratic leaders in taking in finding solutions for responsible, immediate withdrawal from Iraq,<br>
and <br>
Calls for the U.S. government to reject plans for a long-term presence in Iraq, except for those associated with normal diplomatic relations and a commitment to reparation for war damage. <br>
