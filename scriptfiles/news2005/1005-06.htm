<p>WASHINGTON - A new poll conducted by  Zogby International for the National Parks Conservation  Association (NPCA) and released today reveals that 79 percent of  likely voters strongly or somewhat disagree that America's  national parks should be sold to developers or the oil and gas  industry, and 84 percent of likely voters strongly or somewhat  disagree with a possible requirement that the National Park  Service sell commercial naming rights on park buildings and  trails. </p>
<p>   &quot;Like the rewrite of the National Park Service's management  policies initiated by Department of Interior appointee Paul  Hoffman, this is another fundamental attack on our national  parks, and Americans are making their alarm about it very clear,&quot;  said NPCA Vice President for Government Affairs Craig Obey. &quot;This  poll demonstrates the strength of public opinion against these  kinds of extreme proposals.&quot; </p>
<p>   NPCA commissioned the poll to gauge public opinion about a  budget proposal drafted by Rep. Richard Pombo (R-11-Calif.),  Chairman of the House Resources Committee. Chairman Pombo's draft  proposal would sell 15 national parks to oil and gas industries - - closing 23 percent of the acreage in the entire National Park  System. The Park Service would also be required to sell the  island memorial in our nation's capital named for conservationist  and President Teddy Roosevelt to private developers, turn park  vehicles and facilities into billboards for commercial  advertising, and sell commercial naming rights for park buildings  and trails. </p>
<p>   The organization also launched an online advertising campaign  to rally public opposition to Chairman Pombo's proposal. NPCA is  advertising on the web sites of the New York Times, Los Angeles  Times and San Francisco Chronicle. The ads, which were produced  in-house, click through to the organization's web site --  <a href="http://releases.usnewswire.com/redir.asp?ReleaseID=54584&Link=http://www.npca.org">http://www.npca.org</a> -- where visitors can send letters to their  members of Congress about the need to protect national parks from  the proposals forwarded by both Chairman Pombo and Hoffman. </p>
<p>   &quot;What's particularly notable is the vehemence of public  opinion on this,&quot; Obey added. &quot;Seventy percent said they were  strongly opposed to the sale of commercial naming rights. The  American people clearly reject cheapening our national heritage  and placing it on the auction block.&quot; </p>
<p>   Zogby International conducted interviews of 1,000 likely  voters chosen at random nationwide. All calls were made from  Zogby International headquarters in Utica, N.Y., from Sept. 30,  2005 through Oct. 2, 2005. The margin of error is 3.2 percentage  points. </p>
