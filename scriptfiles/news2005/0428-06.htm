<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- April 28 -- CODEPINK: Women for Peace is the most exciting thing to have come out of the peace and justice movement since Abby Hoffman and the Yippies! Before the Iraq war, CODEPINK inspired thousands of women throughout the United States and the world to make the color pink synonymous with political rabble rousing. They hung 40-foot pink banners with political slogans out hotel windows, handed out pink educational flyers at pink lemonade stands, and awarded pink slips (actual women&#146;s slips) to political and corporate leaders who were leading the US toward war. They yelled out questions during Donald Rumsfeld&#146;s testimony in Congress about torture at Abu Ghraib; chained themselves to the entrance of the Halliburton&#146;s shareholders meeting; and brought US military families to Iraq to meet Iraqi victims of US bombs.</font><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Now the same women who brought you those high-profile &#147;interruptions&#148; during George Bush and Dick Cheney&#146;s prime time speeches at the Republican National Convention, bring you an amazing new book: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1930722494/commondreams-20/ref=nosim/" target="_new">STOP THE NEXT WAR NOW: EFFECTIVE RESPONSES TO VIOLENCE AND TERRORISM</a>.</font></p>
<p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">More than 70 of the world&#146;s most visionary experts and activists contribute to this new collection of essays about how the global peace movement can successfully stop the next war. Edited by CODEPINK founders Medea Benjamin and Jodie Evans, with a Forward by Alice Walker and an Introduction by Arundhati Roy, the book offers a time-sensitive, poignant, and practical examination of the increasing world threat of more war and violence; and provides tools that range from changes we can make in our daily lives to ways we can rally the millions of people who support nonviolence to actually take action.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Published by Inner Ocean, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1930722494/commondreams-20/ref=nosim/" target="_new">STOP THE NEXT WAR NOW</a> captures not only the expertise of policy makers but also the insights of those who have experienced the effects of war first hand.
