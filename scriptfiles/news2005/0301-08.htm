<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- March 1 -- This past Saturday, February 26, thousands of young people from across the country marched on Washington to commemorate the first annual Youth AIDS Day by demanding action and accountability from US and world leaders.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;We&#146;re suffering from a world crisis that infects 8,000 young people under age 25 everyday,&#148; said Anna Bergdall, a student at Luther College in Iowa who traveled almost 1,000 miles for the march. &#147;We can&#146;t wait any longer while politicians sort through limited budget accounts and overloaded appropriations bills. HIV/AIDS isn&#146;t an accounting issue; it&#146;s a moral crisis.&#148;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The crowd of mostly college and high school students demanded specific actions from the US government: that it cancel debts preventing poor countries from investing more internal resources to fight AIDS, pay its fair share of $1.5 billion to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria, fund domestic AIDS programs, and promote comprehensive sexual health education, with a call to abstain from abstinence-based programs.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Participants rallied before the march at Lafayette Park, where civil rights pioneer Bernice Johnson Reagon, HIV-positive activist Eric Sawyer(co-founder of Act Up New York), and many others spoke to the crowd, encouraged by the turnout. Dance troupes performed, fraternity brothers took the microphone for a pledge of a different kind, and students stood up to finish the sentence, &#147;I&#146;m an AIDS activist because&#133;.&#148;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">With a crowd estimated at four to five thousand marchers, the Student March Against AIDS was the largest of many Youth AIDS Day events that continue through the week. On Sunday in DC two hundred high school and college students attended the Youth Summit to End Global AIDS. Meanwhile, worldwide events range from a celebration in Egypt encouraging youth to conquer HIV/AIDS stigma, to a videoconference between Ugandan and Canadian university students.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;This is really just the beginning of an explosion in student and youth mobilization&#151;one that will force our nation&#146;s and our world&#146;s leaders to take immediate and appropriate action to stop this pandemic,&#148; said Healy Thompson, National Coordinator of Student Global AIDS Campaign. &#147;If we keep it up, we&#146;re gonna be the generation that sees an end to AIDS.&#148;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Student March Against AIDS was organized by the Student Global AIDS Campaign along with Advocates for Youth, Africa Action, and others. The Student Global AIDS Campaign&#151;on the web at fightglobalaids.org&#151;is a project of Global Justice, a non-profit organization that works to build a movement of young people in the US, in partnership with youth internationally, to promote global justice and responsibility.</font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
