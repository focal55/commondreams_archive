<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- January 27 -- Talon News Washington bureau chief and White House correspondent Jeff Gannon, who accused his colleagues in the press corps of &quot;work(ing) off of the talking points&quot; provided by Democrats, has used Bush administration and Republican National Committee (RNC) documents and releases in his Talon &quot;news reports&quot; verbatim and without attribution. In at least two of his articles, Gannon lifted more than half of the text directly from GOP &quot;fact sheets.&quot; Moreover, as Media Matters for America has pointed out, conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh proclaimed that Gannon repeated a fabricated assertion of Limbaugh's in asking a question at President Bush's January 26 press conference.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">From the January 27 edition of &quot;Jeff Gannon's Washington&quot; radio show on the conservative Internet radio website RIGHTALK:</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">GANNON: But what was very interesting, in his (Bush's) answer, was that -- that he's going to go to the American people. That was the first thing out of his mouth. That &quot;Well, I'm going to take my case to the American people.&quot; Which told everybody in that room that not only was he not going to reach out to Democrats anymore, he was also going to go around the press corps, which, of course, deserves to be gone around because they're not telling the truth about Social Security reform. They continue to work off of the talking points provided them from the opposition. And I know that because I have seen some of my colleagues -- let's say one or two that I've actually witnessed - - read from DNC (Democratic National Committee) talking points on Social Security.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Following are three examples of Gannon lifting extensively from an RNC &quot;Fact Sheet,&quot; a White House &quot;Fact Sheet&quot; and directly from President Bush in his &quot;news reports.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On August 9, 2004, the RNC released a &quot;Fact Sheet&quot; titled &quot;America's Ownership Society: Expanding Opportunities.&quot; On August 10, Talon News published an article by Gannon titled &quot;Bush Pushes Ownership Society.&quot; Of the 866 words in Gannon's article, 466 -- 54 percent of the article -- were taken directly from the RNC talking points.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The relevant portions of both documents are displayed below. The RNC release is listed first followed by Gannon's article:</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">--- RNC &quot;Fact Sheet,&quot; 8/9/04</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Health Savings Accounts (HSAs), which combine low-cost, high- deductible health insurance with tax-free savings accounts to pay for health care expenses.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">--- Gannon article, 8/10/04</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">He is touting health savings accounts (HSAs) that combine low- cost, high-deductible health insurance with tax-free savings accounts to pay for health care expenses. The president has also proposed that insurance premiums associated with HSAs be tax deductible.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">--- RNC:</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Association Health Plans (AHPs) to give America's working families greater access to affordable health insurance. By allowing small businesses to band together and negotiate on behalf of their employees and their families, AHPs would help small businesses and employees obtain health insurance at an affordable price, much like large employers and unions.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">--- Gannon:</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Bush is also promoting greater access to association health plans.

President Bush signed legislation in 2003 to establish a prescription drug benefit under Medicare. Under this plan, private health plans will compete for seniors' business by providing better coverage at affordable prices -- helping to control the costs of Medicare by using market-place competition, not government price-setting. And seniors will be able to choose the health care plan that best fits their needs -- instead of having that choice made by the government.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">--- Gannon:</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The president also believes Medicare would be strengthened if private health plans would be able to compete for seniors' business by providing better coverage at affordable prices. This would help to control the costs of Medicare by using market-place competition, not government price-setting.

The President believes that homeownership is the cornerstone of America's vibrant communities and benefits individual families by building stability and long- term financial security. In June 2002, President Bush issued America's Homeownership Challenge to the real estate and mortgage finance industries to encourage them to join the effort to close the gap that exists between the homeownership rates of minorities and non-minorities. The President also announced the goal of increasing the number of minority homeowners by at least 5.5 million families before the end of the decade. Under his leadership, the overall U.S. homeownership rate in the second quarter of 2004 was at an all time high of 69.2 percent. Minority homeownership set a new record of 51 percent in the second quarter, up 0.2 percentage point from the first quarter and up 2.1 percentage points from a year ago.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">--- Gannon:</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Bush believes that home ownership is the cornerstone of America's vibrant communities and benefits individual families by building stability and long-term financial security.

The President has proposed increasing support for the Self-Help Homeownership Opportunities Program; and</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Simplifying Homebuying and Increasing Education.

President Bush acted promptly to help America's workers by providing tax relief to put more money in families' pockets and encourage businesses to grow and invest. Tax relief brought substantial savings to families and helped fight back the effects of the recession. America's families and small businesses have more money to spend, save, and invest because of the President's 2001 and 2003 tax cuts. This year, 111 million taxpayers will receive, on average, a tax cut of $1,586 and 25 million small business owners will receive $75 billion in total tax relief.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">--- Gannon:</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Democrats contend that the Bush tax cuts have had a detrimental effect on the economy, but Bush says that his cuts were the right medicine for the ailing economy he inherited. He points out that tax relief helped America's workers but putting more money in families' pockets and encouraging businesses to grow and invest.

Out of the 808 words in Gannon's article, 420, or 52 percent, were copied from the White House &quot;Fact Sheet.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The White House Fact Sheet is listed first followed by Gannon's article:</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- White House Fact Sheet (8/16/04):</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">President Bush today announced the most comprehensive restructuring of U.S. military forces overseas since the end of the Korean War.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Gannon article, 8/17/04:</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">President George W.

But with the demise of the Soviet Union, once-familiar threats gave way to less predictable dangers. The lessons of the last 15 years teach us that we often send our forces to unpredictable places.
