<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- February 23 -- The judicial record of appeals court nominee Terrence Boyle is marked by an unusually high percentage of decisions reversed by higher courts and a series of rulings that is damaging to individuals&#146; ability to have their rights protected in court, according to a detailed report on Boyle&#146;s record released today by People For the American Way, a national civil rights and constitutional liberties organization.  The Senate Judiciary Committee has reportedly scheduled a hearing on Boyle&#146;s nomination to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit for March 1, 2005.</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;Terrence Boyle is a judicial disaster. The third time is definitely not the charm for Judge Boyle, who has twice failed to win confirmation to the Fourth Circuit,&#148; said People For the American Way President Ralph G. Neas.  &#147;He has the worst reversal rate of all the district court judges nominated by President Bush, and his rulings reflect a judicial philosophy that is very damaging to the rights of average Americans.  Senators should take a careful look at Judge Boyle&#146;s record and vote to stop him from taking a powerful lifetime position on the appeals court.&#148;</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The People For the American Way report documents that during his tenure as a federal district court judge, Boyle has tried to effectively overrule key federal laws and precedents that protect fundamental civil and constitutional rights.  Among the highlights of Boyle&#146;s record:</font></p><ul><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">     a North Carolina employment case in which he suggested that the federal government should respect discrimination that is explained by a state&#146;s &#147;culture&#148;;<br></font></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">     attempts to exempt state agencies from federal anti-discrimination laws, including an Americans with Disabilities Act case in which he suggested that working is &#147;not a major life activity&#148; warranting protection under the ADA; <br></font></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">a reversal rate that is significantly higher than other judges in the Fourth Circuit, one of the most conservative appeals courts in the country;<br></font></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">     repeated reversals for committing &#147;plain error,&#148; which are obvious and egregious mistakes that harm individual rights and undermine the fairness and integrity of judicial proceedings; <br></font></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">numerous reversals for repeating the same mistakes for which he was reversed in earlier rulings.<br></font></li></ul><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;I believe Judge Boyle&#146;s confirmation hearing will make clear that he does not have the exemplary legal record or the judicial philosophy to justify his promotion to the Fourth Circuit,&#148; said Neas. </font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Neas said that serious questions are also raised by Boyle&#146;s mischaracterizing the reasons for some of his reversals in answers to a questionnaire that he submitted under oath to the Judiciary Committee.  In addition, the number of reversals in his career that he cites in response to this year&#146;s questionnaire has somehow dropped by almost half since his 2003 questionnaire.  This is despite court records showing that he has been reversed in more cases since 2003.</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A copy of the full PFAW report on Boyle&#146;s record can be found at <a href="http://www.pfaw.org/go/Boyle" target="_new">www.pfaw.org/go/Boyle</a>. In addition, People For the American Way is among the signers of a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee expressing concern that thousands of Boyle&#146;s unpublished district court opinions have not been disclosed or reviewed</font>. <br></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
