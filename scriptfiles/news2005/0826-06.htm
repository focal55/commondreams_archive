<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->WASHINGTON - August 26 - This morning, NARAL Pro-Choice America, the nation’s leading advocate for personal privacy and a woman’s right to choose, released a television advertisement highlighting John Roberts’ disturbing record on privacy and choice. The ad highlights a memo written by Roberts for the U.S. Attorney General in 1981, in which he calls an established liberty a “so-called ‘right to privacy’” and a brief he co-authored a decade later calling for the overturn of Roe v. Wade. 
<p>Nancy Keenan, president of NARAL Pro-Choice America, released the following statement about the ad:

<p><i>“At this point in our nation’s history, we need a Supreme Court nominee who respects our fundamental right to privacy, freedom, and personal responsibility. John Roberts dismisses our ‘so-called’ right to privacy – letting politicians into the most private decisions of every American and their families. NARAL Pro-Choice America will continue to be a vocal advocate for women’s fundamental freedoms. There is just too much is at stake to let John Roberts become a decisive vote on the Supreme Court.”
</i>
<p>NARAL Pro-Choice America has resumed a media buy that began two weeks ago. As a part of the ad campaign, the current advertisement will run nationally, and may appear in spot markets on a case-by-case basis. A print advertisement will also launch this weekend.
