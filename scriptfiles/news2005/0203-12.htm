<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">BERKELEY  -- February 3 -- The five-station Pacifica Radio network posted its
third straight annual surplus this past fiscal year, continuing the
non-profit network's best financial run in its 55-year history, Pacifica
announced today.

</font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Pacifica's overall revenues totaled $16.04 million in the fiscal year ending
September 30, 2004 (FYE04), according to Chief Financial Officer Lonnie
Hicks. Operating expenses reached $15.38 million.

</font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"This is another important milestone for the network and it will allow us to
focus our energies on expanding our affiliate network, promoting our diverse
peace and justice programming nationally, and digitizing and upgrading our
broadcast facilities," said Pacifica Executive Director Dan Coughlin.

</font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Pacifica CFO Lonnie Hicks said that a series of internal cost controls and
one-month reserve requirements were critical to ensuring the network's
financial health in recent years.

</font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Between FYE01 and FYE04, listener support climbed 60 percent. Overall
revenues grew from $10.98 in FYE01 to $16.04 in FYE04. Net assets increased
from $1.9 million in FYE01 to $5.3 million in FYE04.

</font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">While listener support fueled the network's growth, CFO Hicks warned that
projections are flat for the period ahead.

</font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Still, the surpluses generated in the last three years alone total more than
those than in the previous eleven-year period 1990-2001.

</font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Pacifica's overall financial results are bucking the public radio trend.

</font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A CPB-funded review of 314 public radio licencees showed that 45 percent ran
deficits in 2003 and 56 percent did not achieve an acceptable level of
financial health (net revenue at least two percent of operating revenue).

</font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The report said the benchmark for excellent financial health was five
percent of operating revenue. See "Having It All" at
<a href="http://www.cpb.org/radio/stations/%20" target="_new">http://www.cpb.org/radio/stations/
</a>
</font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Pacifica's net revenue as a percentage of operating revenue has averaged
more than six percent for the past three years.

</font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Founded in 1949, Pacifica Radio's mission is to engage in any activity that
shall contribute to a lasting understanding between nations and between the
individuals of all nations, races, creeds and colors.

</font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The five Pacifica stations are: KPFA 94.1 FM in Berkeley, KPFK 90.7 FM in
Los Angeles, KPFT 90.1 FM in Houston, WBAI 99.5 FM in New York City, and
WPFW 89.3 FM in Washington, DC.

</font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In addition, more than 100 radio stations nationwide carry Pacifica
programming including the daily morning news magazine Democracy Now! hosted
by Amy Goodman and Juan Gonzalez.
