<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CONCORD, New Hampshire - July 28 - </font><center><center><p><b><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">OreoMobile Has 12-Foot Stacks of Giant Oreos that Represent U.S. Spending on Education, Job Training, Healthcare, and the Pentagon<br>Multi-Year Campaign Kicked off Thursday in Iowa and New Hampshire</font></b></p></center></center><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At a news conference and ice cream celebration in Concord Thursday, Ben Cohen climbed aboard his new &#147;OreoMobile&#148; and explained that it&#146;s never too early to start an issue campaign in New Hampshire and Iowa.</font><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">What&#146;s the focus of Cohen&#146;s campaign? Congress and the Administration are not spending Americans&#146; tax dollars in accordance with our nation&#146;s values.</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;Canceling weapons systems designed to fight the collapsed Soviet Union&#151;weapons that have no role in fighting terrorists&#151;is not being weak on defense,&#148; said Cohen. &#147;It is rebuilding our schools, providing health care for our kids, training our workforce for decent jobs, reducing our dependence on foreign oil, and creating a decent quality of life for all of us.&#148;</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;We&#146;re just going to show people here the facts,&#148; said Cohen. &#147;We&#146;ll be doing this day-after-day, year-after-year. Once people understand the facts, they will demand changes, and there&#146;s no place better to demand changes than in Iowa and New Hampshire every four years.&#148;</font></p><p> </p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The sweetest part of the campaign so far is the OreoMobile itself. Click here to check it out: <a href="http://www.showmethemoney.net" target="_new">www.showmethemoney.net</a>. </font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Using giant Oreos as props, OreoMobile actors will dramatize in 15-minute shows how Congress can&#151;easily and safely&#151;spend more of our taxes on what Americans, including the citizens of New Hampshire and Iowa, really want. These shows will take place towns across New Hampshire and Iowa this summer.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">An animated version of the Oreo show has been viewed on the web by over 1 million people. See it at <a href="http://www.truemajority.com/fun/" target="_new">http://www.truemajority.com/fun/</a>.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The OreoMobile demonstrates that a trim of wasteful Pentagon spending could have significant benefits for Americans&#151;without putting national security at risk.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If the Pentagon trims $35 billion currently wasted on obsolete, Cold War weapons, not only could the US begin reducing the deficit and save the lives of millions of starving kids in impoverished countries, but the states could receive enough money to make dreams come true. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">New Hampshire, for example, would receive enough money&#151;proportionately&#151;to 1) provide a year&#146;s worth of health insurance to all the kids in the state who don&#146;t have it, 2) renovate its crumbling schools over ten years, and 3) offer job training to half of New Hampshire&#146;s workers who were laid off by large companies last year.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Recent polling by the Program on International Policy Attitudes shows that Americans support spending wasteful Pentagon funds on other priorities, like healthcare.
