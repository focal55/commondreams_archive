<p>PORTLAND - November 29 - Democracy Maine began running radio ads this morning urging Maine’s two senators to vote against the nomination of Judge Samuel Alito to the US Supreme Court.

<p>The 60-second ad, airing in southern Maine radio stations, questions Alito’s stance on Roe v. Wade and his differing positions. A 1985 job application in which Alito describes himself as “a conservative” who is “particularly proud” of his legal arguments against a woman’s right to choose is at odds with what he has told Senators Susan Collins and Olympia Snowe about respecting prior rulings of the court.

<p>The ad begins with the line, “Some people will say anything to get a job.”

<p>“Although Judge Alito has succeeded in telling Senators what they want to hear, we now know through recently released documents that Judge Alito does not believe a right to privacy or a freedom of choice exist in the constitution,” said Jon Crasnick, executive director of Democracy Maine. “We also know that, in a 1985 Federal job application, Judge Alito wrote that he was “particularly proud” of his contributions to Reagan Administration cases that argued that ‘the Constitution does not protect the right to an abortion,’ a position that Judge Alito said ‘I personally believe very strongly’.”

<p>Alito has dismissed his earlier statements by saying he was merely “an advocate seeking a job.” 

<p>“But now he once again is an advocate seeking a job, an advocate for the far right,” Crasnick said. “So which Judge Alito are we supposed to believe? How can Maine’s two Senators, who say they are strongly pro-choice, vote for someone whose record clearly shows he is at odds with their views, and the views of the majority of Americans?”

<p>In a letter to both Maine senators, Democracy Maine asked them to vote against Alito’s nomination.

<p>“Judge Alito issued an opinion in 1991 that held that women must inform their husbands before receiving an abortion, and upheld Pennsylvania’s formerly broad limits on abortions, limits later struck down by the US Supreme Court,” the letter states. “Judge Alito cast this 1991 vote despite the 1973 precedent of Roe v. Wade. Given a clear choice between his personal opposition to abortion and the precedent of Roe v. Wade, he sided as a judge with his personal opinion. This is not respect for precedent.

<p>“The values of the far right are not the values of the vast majority of Maine’s citizens. Based on what we now know, we strongly urge you to oppose the nomination of Samuel Alito to the United States Supreme Court.”

<p>The letter is signed by Jacqueline Potter, Anthony Buxton and Robert CS Monks.

<p>Democracy Maine was founded in April of 2005 by Maine citizens who wished to expose the effect on America of a small, largely unknown group of fabulously wealthy conservatives, who seek to turn our public policies back a century or more. Democracy Maine provides a voice for Maine citizens who believe that this group of extremely conservative Americans has too much influence, and too little accountability.
