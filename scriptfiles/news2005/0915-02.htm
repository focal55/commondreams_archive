<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->WASHINGTON - September 15 - After three days of staffing the Americans for Insurance Reform Katrina Insurance Hotline (888-450-5545),  AIR can already report some important results: 

<p>AIR has received many calls from Louisiana and Mississippi residents who are insured by smaller insurance companies (not the major companies like State Farm, Allstate or Travelers).  Their insurance carriers are saying they are unwilling to supply policyholders with immediate living expenses until a claims adjuster has inspected their property.  At the same time, these insurance representatives are unwilling to provide policyholders with even a broad estimate of when such an inspection might happen.  Numerous people have told AIR, “Our money is running out and our insurance companies can't tell us when or if any help is on the way.”

<p>Several policyholders report that representatives of United Fire Insurance, which also owns Lafayette, Addison, American Indemnity, and United Fire Lloyds, are saying it is company policy that no losses at all will be covered by homeowners policies, including additional living expenses that some people need right now to survive.  Only individuals with flood insurance (which most people do not have and is underwritten by the federal government) will receive anything, according to these company representatives.  This is true even if homes were not damaged by flooding, or if the policyholder was forced to evacuate and needs immediate living expenses.  Calls to company headquarters for comment were not returned.

<p>Louisiana resident Shawna Balding reported to AIR that on-the-ground representatives at Travelers had told her 78-year-old mother, a New Orleans resident whose home was flooded, that she would have to travel to Baton Rouge or Gulfport to pick up the check owed to her for “additional living expenses.”  After Shawna called the AIR hotline, AIR mentioned the situation on national television.  After that TV appearance, Travelers called AIR to say that their vice-president overseeing the Gulf Coast situation would personally ensure that this did not happen again.  While it is unclear to AIR if Shawna’s mother was the victim of company policy or the company’s poor communication with claims representatives, AIR congratulates Travelers for correcting the mistake and ensuring that it will not happen again.  AIR continues to monitor this situation.  

<p>AIR also applauds Shawna Balding for informing AIR of her situation, showing the power that individuals can have just by complaining. “People have power,” said said J. Robert Hunter, AIR co-founder, Director of Insurance for the Consumer Federation of America and former Federal Insurance Administrator.  “Just making your complaint known can change things.  It is very important to speak out if you feel an injustice is being done to you as you try to rebuild your life after this awful hurricane damage." 
 
<p>The AIR Katrina Insurance Hotline (888-450-5545) is staffed Monday through Friday, 10 am to 6 pm EST.  AIR is a project of the national consumer organization, Center for Justice & Democracy.
