<p>SAN FRANCISCO – November 17 - The Sierra Club today announced plans for a new television series with award winning filmmaker Robert Greenwald ("Outfoxed," "Wal-mart: The High Cost of Low Price").

<p>"Sierra Club Chronicles," a new monthly television series produced by Greenwald, captures the dramatic efforts of committed individuals across the country working everyday to protect the health of their environment and their communities.

<p>"All over America, there are inspirational, real life stories of women and men defending their homes, health and families from environmental hazards and threats," explained Carl Pope, Executive Director of the Sierra Club. "'Sierra Club Chronicles' will take viewers directly into those communities and provide a first hand look at these profiles in environmental courage."

<p>The people and stories profiled in "Sierra Club Chronicles" come from diverse backgrounds: ranchers in New Mexico, emergency medical technicians in New York City, fishermen in Alaska, neighbors of a chemical plant in Mississippi, but all are united in a common cause - the fight to protect their families, communities and the lands and livelihoods they love from pollution, corporate greed and short-sighted government policies.

<p>"Sierra Club Chronicles" consists of seven half-hour episodes that will launch on Link TV on January 12, 2006 immediately following the ACLU's original half hour program, "Freedom Files." One new program will premiere the second Thursday of each month at 8:30 PM Eastern and Pacific through July 2006. Link Satellite TV is on DirecTV channel 375 and Dish Network channel 9410. (www.linktv.org).

<p>Beyond the initial television broadcast DVDs and videos of "Sierra Club Chronicles" will be available for consumers, educators, and other organizations. In addition, Sierra Club volunteers and allies will host house parties to view the episodes and encourage viewers to take action on the issues. For information on all the episodes and ways to take action visit the series website www.sierraclubtv.org

<p>"Sierra Club Chronicles" is made possible by the generous support of the Ford Foundation.
