<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">NEWCASTLE, Australia - July 26 - Greenpeace's flagship, the Rainbow  Warrior, closed down the world's largest coal export port in Newcastle  today and called on Australia to quit coal and tackle climate change by  moving to a clean energy economy.</font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Rainbow Warrior dropped anchor in the channel leading to the  Kooragang and Carrington terminals in Newcastle harbour. In addition,  teams of activists occupied a 2.5 million tonne coal stockpile and one  of four huge coal loaders.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Greenpeace Australia climate and energy campaigner Ben Pearson said: &quot;We  are here today to expose Australia's dangerous addiction to coal export  dollars and its significant contribution towards global climate change.  Newcastle sends 80 million tonnes of coal to the world each year, and  every tonne causes worse droughts, bushfires, storms and floods. Every  hour that we are here, we stop coal that could emit thousands of tonnes  of greenhouse gases from leaving.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Australia is a major exporter of pollution and a climate destroyer. It  exports coal to thirty-five countries. In 2002-03, 80 % (165 million  tonnes) went to Asia. The main customers are Japan and South Korea.  Taiwan, India, China, Malaysia, Thailand and the Philippines buy  Australian coal.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;By continuing to export coal to Asia, Australia is locking developing  countries into a fossil fuel future that perpetuates climate change,  ignores sustainability and denies their independence from imported and  expensive fuel. This behaviour is despicable and must be stopped,&quot; said  Athena Ronquillo from Greenpeace International.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Australia has the potential to be a world leader in renewable energy  exports, sharing its vast solar and wind resources to its neighbouring  countries in the region. It could play a more constructive role in  addressing poverty and environmental issues in these already vulnerable  economies by supporting their shift to safe, clean energy sources.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Coal burns our common future but renewable energy unites us.  By  embracing renewable energy, Australia will embrace a future common to  Asia as well - a clean, sustainable future,&quot; Ronquillo concluded.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Greenpeace's flagship sailed into Sydney Harbour on July 22nd. She will  visit China, Thailand and Philippines as part of the 'Clean Energy  Revolution tour' to raise the urgency of dangerous climate change and  promote the huge potential of renewable energy and energy efficiency in  Asia Pacific region. </font></p><p></p><div align="CENTER"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">###</font></div><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"></font><!-- #EndEditable -->
