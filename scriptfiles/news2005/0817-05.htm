<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->BEIJING - August 17 - Greenpeace International today 
released a report of its’ scientific investigations into the hazardous 
chemicals found in the scrap yards where electronic waste is recycled in 
China and India. The results from analysing the dust from workshops, as 
well as wastewater, soil and sediment from local rivers show 
conclusively that all stages in processing the e-waste enable toxic 
chemicals, including heavy metals, to be released into the workplace and 
into the surrounding environment.

<p>“The report provides a compelling case for immediate action in both 
countries to address workplace health and safety issues, as well as 
waste management practices,” said Dr. Kevin Brigden, a Greenpeace 
International scientist, who collected the samples. “The data reinforces 
the need for the electronics industry to eliminate the use of harmful 
substances in their products at the design stage and take responsibility 
for their products at the end of their lifecycle.”

<p>The release of the report, “Toxic Tech: Recycling of electronic wastes 
in China and India: workplace and environmental contamination", comes a 
few days after the European Directive on Waste from Electrical and 
Electronics Equipment (WEEE) came into effect on 13^th August (1). The 
directive, which regulates the handling of e-waste in the EU region by 
making electronics producers responsible, has yet to be implemented in 
many EU countries. Despite an EU ban on exports of hazardous waste, 
including e-waste, to developing countries, there is increasing evidence 
of e-waste being sent to Asia from Europe illegally (2). The majority of 
the waste being exported to Asia comes from the United States (3).

<p>Concentrations of lead in dust samples collected from some workshops in 
China were hundreds of times higher than typical levels of household 
dusts. The levels of lead in dust collected from similar workshops in 
India were approximately 5-20 times background levels (4). Contamination 
was not limited to the recycling yards; dust collected from the homes of 
two e-waste recycling workers in China had higher levels of heavy 
metals, particularly lead, compared to dust collected from one 
neighbouring house with no link to e-waste recycling.

<p>Samsung, Nokia, Sony and Sony Ericsson have made commitments to 
eliminate the use of hazardous chemicals such as PVC and brominated 
flame retardants (BFRs) in the manufacturing of their products (5). LG 
Electronics is the latest to join the list of companies in committing to 
substitute these harmful substances with safer alternatives.

<p>“With the most recent commitment of LG, the five ‘first in class’ 
companies in the electronics sector with 55% share of the global mobile 
telephone market and Sony, which is the leader in the electronics 
industry, show that it is possible to make electronic equipment without 
the use of these hazardous substances and still remain profitable”, said 
Zeina Alhajj, Greenpeace International Toxics Campaigner.

<p>Other companies like Dell, IBM/Lenovo, HP, Siemens, Acer, Toshiba, 
Panasonic, Fujitsu-Siemens and Apple have so far, failed to commit.

<p>Greenpeace is an independent, campaigning organisation which uses 
non-violent, creative confrontation to expose global environmental 
problems, and to force the solutions which are essential to a green and 
peaceful future.

*Notes to editors*:

<p>1. EU Member States should have implemented the Directive into national 
legislation by August 2004 and by August 2005, producers/importers 
should have had systems in place to take back and manage WEEE. Most EU 
Member States are at least one year late in transposing the Directive.

<p>2. The EU ban is part of the Basel convention banning hazardous waste 
export from Rich to poor countries. Several reports by EU authorities 
(such as IMPEL) have documented this illegal trade in e-waste. Please 
see - <a href="http://www.icer.org.uk" target="_new">www.icer.org.uk</a> <http://www.icer.org.uk/>and also,

<p>4. Lead is a toxic heavy metal, and one of the hazardous chemicals used 
by the electronics industry that is to be banned by a European Directive 
on the Restriction of the Hazardous chemicals (RoHS) in electronic 
products, with exemptions.

<p>5. BFRs are environmentally persistent chemicals, some of which are 
highly bioaccumulative and capable of interfering with normal brain 
development in animals.
