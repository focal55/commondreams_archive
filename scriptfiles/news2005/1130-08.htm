<p>WASHINGTON - November 30 - Today the U.S. Supreme Court will hear arguments in the first 
            abortion rights cases since Chief Justice John Roberts took the 
            helm. Two cases &#8212; <EM>Scheidler v. National Organization for 
            Women</EM> and <EM>Operation Rescue v. National Organization for 
            Women</EM> &#8212; could have a lasting impact on women's ability to 
            access a full range of reproductive health services. The third, <EM>Ayotte v. Planned Parenthood of Northern New England</EM>, could 
            permit more barriers to abortion services, without making an 
exception for women&#8217;s health.
<P>"Women's access to abortion and other reproductive health care is 
            at great risk," said NOW President Kim Gandy. "Time and again, our 
            fate is put in the hands of nine justices. With the decisions on 
            these critical cases, the power and consequence of who sits on the 
            Supreme Court will be demonstrated mightily."</P>
            <P>After nearly 20 years of litigation and two trips to the Supreme 
            Court to protect patients and clinics from organized violence, NOW 
            is returning for the third time. At question in <EM>Scheidler v. 
            NOW</EM> and <EM>Operation Rescue v. NOW</EM> is whether the 
            nationwide anti-racketeering injunction will remain in place. Issued 
            in 1999, this injunction has contributed to the dramatic reduction 
            in the incidences of violence at clinics. </P>
            <P>"Without this injunction, the legal right to abortion could 
            become meaningless in some parts of the country," said Gandy. "If 
            women are too terrified to walk into clinics and healthcare 
            providers are too terrified to keep their doors open, then we will 
            have already lost the fight for reproductive freedom. Roe v. Wade 
            won't mean much if the clinics have been forced to close one by 
            one."</P>
            <P>In the1980s, groups like the Pro-Life Action Network and its 
            offshoot, Operation Rescue, engaged in a massive, coordinated 
            campaign to end abortion by closing women's health clinics through 
            the use of fear, force and violence. NOW pursued this suit under the 
            Racketeer-Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act in order 
            to reach the groups' kingpins who organized and incited the acts of 
            terror. Joseph Scheidler, Randall Terry and other leaders of the 
            self-described "pro-life mafia" had vowed to stop abortion "by any 
            means necessary," and the ensuing attacks included arson, bombings, 
            violent blockades, death threats and even murder. Charges by the 
            defendants that the injunction limits their First Amendment right to 
            free speech were specifically rejected by the Supreme Court. </P>
            <P>"Of course Scheidler and Operation Rescue want to have the 
            injunction lifted," Gandy said. "They are not happy simply yelling 
            at women and girls, taking their photographs, copying their license 
            plate numbers, harassing the clinic's employees and vendors, and 
            using other non-violent tactics. They want to return to the days of 
            using physical assault to terrorize patients and doctors, in order 
            to shut down the clinics permanently.&#8221;</P>
            <P>"This injunction has increased women's safety and helped protect 
            the clinics," said Gandy. "The Supreme Court should recognize these 
            concerted crimes for what they are &#8212; an organized campaign to put an 
            end to women's constitutional right to 
abortion."<!-- #EndEditable -->
