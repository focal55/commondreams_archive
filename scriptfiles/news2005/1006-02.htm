<p>IOWA CITY, Iowa - More than 500 people filled the Pomerantz Center at the University of Iowa on Wednesday night for a “Town Meeting on the Future of the Media,” voicing their concerns about media consolidation to Federal Communications Commissioner Jonathan S. Adelstein.

<p>“We learned last night that people in the heartland see many good reasons to oppose further media concentration,” Adelstein said in a statement. “We heard a lot of solid evidence that the area’s media may be failing to address key issues of local concern. People decried the lack of serious coverage of the problems faced in their communities. They pleaded with us not to let it get any worse.”

<p>The event featured panel discussions with community leaders and local media makers on how increasing concentration of ownership affects local news and information, followed by an open microphone session. The crowd lined up for nearly three hours to offer public testimony on the quality of local news coverage, increasing commercialism, and the impact of media giants such as Clear Channel and Sinclair Broadcasting.

<p>“The people of Iowa are very concerned about what’s happening to their media,” said Amanda Ballantyne, field organizer for Free Press, which presented the event along with the University of Iowa Lecture Committee. “Instead of allowing big media companies to swallow up even more TV and radio stations and newspapers, the audience made clear that they want policies that encourage more diverse, independent and local voices.”

<p>Commissioner Michael Copps was unable to attend the hearing because of a family emergency. But Adelstein and Jordan Goldstein, Copps’ senior legal adviser, listened attentively until nearly midnight, as more than 100 concerned citizens each offered two minutes of testimony. All testimony was recorded and will be submitted to the FCC and Iowa’s congressional delegation.

<p>“The verdict was unanimous -- from elected leaders, teachers, workers, minorities, nurses, parents and grandparents -- people are dissatisfied their with local media outlets,” Adelstein said. “The message I will take back to Washington is that we had better address the very real issues raised by concerned citizens of Iowa before we consider further media consolidation.”

<p>Free Press previously helped organize town meetings in Portland, Ore; Albuquerque, N.M.; Dearborn, Mich.; and St. Paul, Minn. The next town meeting is planned for Asheville, N.C., later this year. 

<p>“The citizens of Iowa spoke about how the public airwaves should be used to serve the public interest, not the financial priorities of a few big media corporations,” said Josh Silver, executive director of Free Press. “We hope all of the FCC Commissioners will make an effort to participate in events like this one, so that average citizens can make their voices heard in the crucial policy decisions that will impact all of us.”
