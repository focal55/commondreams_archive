<p>SILVER SPRING, Maryland - December 7 - <p><b>Who:</b> Members of the Japanese Diet (Parliament): House of Councilors member Keiko Chiba from the Democratic Party, and House of Representatives members Tomoko Abe from the Social Democratic Party and Masayoshi Nataniya from the Democratic Party. Japanese Delegation representing The Citizens’ Coalition Concerned about Home-porting of US Nuclear-powered Carriers to Yokosuka, including Delegation Executive Director Masahiko Goto. Peace Action Executive Director Kevin Martin and Political and Organizing director Paul Kawika Martin.

 

<p><b>What: </b>Press Conference and Rally Against Military Proposals to Station Nuclear Carriers in Yokosuka, Japan.

 

<p><b>Where and When:</b> December 8th, 2005 National Press Club, 10:00AM,-11:00AM, 529 14th St NW, Washington DC, 20045, East Ballroom. 

Rally at Lafayette Square Park (in front of White House) 2:00PM

 

<p>On December 8th, 2005, members of the Japanese Parliament along with the Japanese based League of Citizen Organizations Opposed to the Deployment of a Nuclear-powered Aircraft Carrier at Yokosuka, will hold a Press Conference at the National Press Club, voicing joint opposition against the recent proposal to base Nuclear Powered submarines at Yokosuka Port in Japan just 35 miles from Tokyo’s 30 million people. Peace Action will be hosting the Japanese mission while they are in Washington.

 

<p>“As the only country to face the devastation of American nuclear weapons, Japan understands all too well the nuclear danger. The proposal to make Japan the only country in the world where the Pentagon home-ports a nuclear carrier outside the U.S. shows incredible insensitivity and callousness by the Pentagon towards the Japanese. We should not force a nuclear powered warship on a people that do not wish to host it. A home port should be welcoming, not hostile,” said Kevin Martin, Executive Director of Peace Action.

 

<p>Following the press conference, there will be a rally at Lafayette Park across from the White House, where American and Japanese citizens will come together to protest the administrations decision.
