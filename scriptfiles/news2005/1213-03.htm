<p>WASHINGTON - December 13 - The U.S. Department of  State has refused to respond to a Freedom of Information Act  request for Katrina-related documents from Citizens for  Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW).</p>
<p>   On September 7, 2005, CREW sent Freedom of Information Act  (FOIA) requests to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the  Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), and the Department of  State, asking for records and communications regarding the  federal government's preparedness and response to hurricane  Katrina.</p>
<p>   Specifically, CREW asked the Department of State for details  regarding the myriad offers to assist in relief efforts made by  foreign governments during hurricane Katrina, including offers  made by Venezuela, the Netherlands, Pakistan and Bangladesh, to  name a few.  CREW further sought records relating to the U.S.  government's response to those offers.</p>
<p>   Rather than providing the requested records as required by  federal law, on October 6, 2005, the Department of State sent  CREW a non-responsive form letter demanding that CREW further  describe the records sought.</p>
<p>   The FOIA requests to DHS and FEMA are still pending.</p>
<p>   &quot;The American public is entitled to know which countries  generously offered their assistance in the aftermath of Katrina  and how the U.S. government responded to those offers.  The State  Department's refusal to provide this information suggests that  our government is still attempting to hide its ineffectual  response to Katrina,&quot; said Melanie Sloan, executive director of  CREW.  &quot;The only way to ensure greater preparedness for any  future disaster is for there to be a full airing of the failures  of the past.  It is scandalous that our government is still  trying to cover up its breathtakingly inadequate response to the  greatest natural disaster in our nation's history.&quot;</p>
<p>   The CREW FOIA and the Department of State's response is  available at <a href="http://releases.usnewswire.com/redir.asp?ReleaseID=58038&Link=http://www.citizensforethics.org">http://www.citizensforethics.org</a>.</p>
