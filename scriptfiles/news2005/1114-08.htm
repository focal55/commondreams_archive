<p>WASHINGTON - November 14 - November 13-19 is American Education Week. The theme for 2005 is A Strong America Starts with Great Public Schools. In honor of this celebration of public schools, the Moving Ideas Network has collected resources on the challenges schools face, reforms and innovative strategies to fix them, and tools for advocates and parents to help make change in their communities.

 

<p>The report, "<a href="http://www.movingideas.org/content/en/report_content/american_education_week.htm">American Education Week: Ensuring Great Public Schools for All</a>", includes reports with statistics on the status of public education in the United States. 

 

<p>While reports show U.S. students lagging behind in proficiency tests, minorities and low-income students are even further behind than the general population. For example, a Center for American Progress report details that only 15% of low-income 4th graders achieved proficiency in reading in 2003, compared to 41% of non-poor students, and 39% of white 4th graders can read at the proficient level, compared to only 12% of African-American students and 14% of Latinos.

 

<p>A report from Cities for Peace says that little is being done to improve U.S. education. In particular, President Bush's 'No Child Left Behind Act' is underfunded by $33.2 billion.

 

<p>"Our public education system clearly needs some attention, and not just during this special education week," asserts Moving Ideas Director Melanie Alston-Akers.
