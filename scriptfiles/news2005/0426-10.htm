<p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- April 26 -- The recent spate of unfavorable media disclosures surrounding House Majority Leader Tom DeLay&#146;s ethical lapses may be hurting more than just his image; his ability to raise money also appears to have been severely affected. Contributions to DeLay&#146;s legal defense fund have fallen off sharply according to figures just released by the U.S. House of Representatives&#146; Legislative Resource Center.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the first quarter of 2005, DeLay&#146;s legal defense fund raised only $47,750.   That is less than one-fifth of the amount raised in the last quarter of 2004, when the fund collected $254,250. </font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">An <a href="http://www.citizen.org/congress/delay/" target="_new">analysis</a> by Public Citizen reveals that contributions to the fund from DeLay&#146;s congressional colleagues also slowed considerably during the first three months of 2005. Only nine members of Congress contributed a total of $30,000, which is an 83 percent drop from the last three months of 2004 when 36 of DeLay&#146;s fellow representatives contributed a total of $174,500.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Under House rules, donors may contribute a maximum of $5,000 per calendar year to a legal defense fund, and contributions can be made by individuals, political action committees (PACs), and corporate and union treasuries.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But Rep. Spencer Bachus (R-Ala.) found a way to circumvent the House rules, according to the Public Citizen analysis. He made one $5,000 contribution through his leadership PAC and a second from his campaign fund.  That $10,000 total contribution makes Bachus the largest congressional contributor to DeLay&#146;s legal defense in the last three months.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The congressional contributors who have given the most to DeLay&#146;s legal defense fund over the four-year life of the fund are: Rep. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.), $20,000; former Rep. &#147;Billy&#148; Tauzin (R-La.), $15,000; and Rep. Henry Bonilla (R-Texas), $15,000.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">While none of those representatives made contributions in the first quarter of 2005, five staffers to House Majority Whip Roy Blunt and the executive director of his PAC contributed a total of $2,750. </font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;It looks like most members of Congress are trying to distance themselves from Tom DeLay&#146;s ethics problems by closing their wallets,&#148; said Public Citizen President Joan Claybrook. &#147;If money truly speaks louder than words, then the absence of it is sending a loud message that this ethically challenged majority leader&#146;s greatest asset to his colleagues &#150; the ability to raise large bundles of cash &#150; is waning.&#148;</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Other findings of the analysis of contributions to DeLay&#146;s legal defense fund since its inception in July 2000 through March 2005 include:</font></p><ul><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">     Since it was formed in 2000, DeLay&#146;s legal defense fund has raised a total of $1,046,971.<br></font></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Corporations and their employees have contributed $593,996 to the fund, or 57 percent of all contributions.<br></font></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Leading industry contributors (including their employees) have been energy and natural resources ($127,300); construction ($80,800); communications and electronics ($65,250); agriculture ($53,250); finance, insurance and real estate ($49,790); and lawyers and lobbyists ($36,500).</font></li></ul><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;It&#146;s noteworthy that the energy and natural resources industry led in contributions to his legal defense,&#148; said Frank Clemente, director of Public Citizen&#146;s Congress Watch. &#147;Of course, if you consider DeLay&#146;s leadership on the recently passed energy bill, with its massive industry tax breaks and incentives, it would appear that energy companies got a big return on their investment.&#148;</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A complete analysis of DeLay&#146;s legal defense fund and background on his previous violations of House Rules is available by clicking <a href="http://www.citizen.org/congress/delay/" target="_new">here</a>.</font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
