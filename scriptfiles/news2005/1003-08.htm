<p>WASHINGTON - Human Rights Campaign President Joe Solmonese made the following statement about President Bush’s nomination of White House Counsel Harriet Miers to the Supreme Court.

<p>“There’s very little information about Harriet Miers and we hope that the confirmation process will provide more insight into her views,” said Solmonese. “Justice O’Connor’s replacement could maintain or tip balance on the court on equality.

<p>“With little known about Ms. Miers’ views, it’s critical that the Senate thoroughly examines her nomination and that she provide complete and candid answers,” added Solmonese. “It’s important that Ms. Miers demonstrate she’s a worthy successor to Justice O’Connor, a consensus builder in a closely divided court. With a lifetime appointment, the Senate should be sure that a Justice Miers would safeguard the rights of all Americans.”
<b>
<p>HARRIET MIERS’ BACKGROUND</b>

<p>Harriet Miers was born in 1945 in Dallas and is one of five children. Miers graduated from Southern Methodist University with a degree in mathematics and, again, in 1970, when she obtained her law degree. Upon graduation from law school, Miers clerked for U.S. District Judge Joe Estes. In 1972, she joined a Texas law firm, Locke, Purnell, Boren, Laney & Neely, where she was their first female attorney. She remained at the firm and its successor firm for almost 30 years, working as a commercial litigator.

<p>In 1985, Miers became the first woman president of the Dallas Bar Association, and in 1992, she was elected as the first woman president of the Texas State Bar. In 1993, Miers reportedly was hired as Bush’s personal attorney, providing legal counsel on a real estate matter and also for Bush’s gubernatorial campaign.

<p>In 1995, then-Gov. Bush appointed her as chairwoman of the Texas Lottery Commission. In 1996, Miers was elected president of her law firm, Locke, Purnell, and, thus, became the first woman to lead a major Texas law firm. While at Locke, Purnell, she presided over its merger with Lindell, Sapp, Ziveley, Hill & LaBoon in 1998, and later became co-managing partner of the new firm, Locke, Liddell & Sapp. Miers resigned from the Texas Lottery Commission in 2000.

<p>After winning the White House, President Bush selected Miers in 2001 to serve as his staff secretary. She later served as deputy chief of staff for policy in 2003 and as White House counsel in 2004.

<b><p>NOTE ON EXODUS</b>

<p>During the announcement, President Bush referenced Miers’ affiliation with Exodus Ministry. This is not the so called “ex-gay” group, but is “a non-denominational Christian organization established to assist ex-offenders and their families become productive members of society by meeting both their spiritual and physical needs.”

<p><i>The Human Rights Campaign is the largest national lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender political organization with members throughout the country. It effectively lobbies Congress, provides campaign support and educates the public to ensure that LGBT Americans can be open, honest and safe at home, at work and in the community.
