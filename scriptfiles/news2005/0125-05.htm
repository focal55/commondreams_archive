Challenging widespread prejudices, 'Reclaiming Public Water' presents a wide range of examples of public utility reform resulting in major improvements in access to clean water and sanitation. The book is written by water utility managers and civil society campaigners from more than twenty countries. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">'Reclaiming Public Water' will be launched on January 28th during the World Social Forum in Porto Alegre. This Brazilian city is a prime example of how public water delivery can be improved through democratic reform, a common theme of the book. Increased citizens involvement in decision-making, including so-called Participatory Budgeting, has helped Porto Alegre's public water utility to become one of the most effective in Latin America.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Donor governments and institutions like the World Bank need to acknowledge the failure of privatisation and instead concentrate on boosting the performance and coverage of public utilities&quot;, says Satoko Kishimoto of the Amsterdam- based Transnational Institute (TNI), co-author of the book. In numerous cities around the world, private water corporations have failed to deliver the promised improvements while raising water tariffs far beyond the reach of poor households. This was also the case in Bolivia, where the government earlier this month decided to terminate the concession of French water multinational Suez in the cities of El Alto and La Paz. The decision followed protests from the population of El Alto against dramatic price increases and Suez' failure to expand access to piped water and sewage. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">'Reclaiming Public Water' will be launched at a seminar on Friday January 28th, 8.30 - 11 o'clock, venue E203, World Social Forum, Porto Alegre. During the seminar there will be translation into English, Spanish and French.  </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A free copy of 'Reclaiming Public Water - Achievements, Struggles and Visions from Around the World' is available on request for review  for media purposes only, all other copies must be purchased.
