<p>NEW YORK - November 1 - Today, Miles Rapoport, President of Demos, a national voting rights and public policy research organization, issued the following statement in response to an October 28th decision by district court Judge J. Hobart Darbyshire upholding Governor Vilsack's executive order ending permanent disfranchisement of Iowans with felony convictions: 

<p>"The court wisely affirmed the essence of Governor Vilsack's executive order issued in June: antiquated laws that permanently deny any citizen's right to vote are out of step with the rest of the country and weaken Iowa's democracy. With this ruling, up to 80,000 formerly disfranchised Iowans will be eligible to vote again—many of them people of color, who are disproportionately affected by disfranchisement laws. African Americans, in particular, make up only 2% of Iowa's population but are nearly 25% of the state's disfranchised citizens. 

<p>"The Governor's executive order was the right thing to do, as was the court's decision. The next step is to make sure that local election officials and corrections agencies fully implement the order by reaching out to people who were disfranchised to make sure they know about their newly confirmed eligibility. 

<p>"With this ruling, Iowa joins 46 states that restore voting rights to people with felony convictions. The other four states—Alabama, Florida, Kentucky and Virginia—are clearly out of step with the rest of the nation and the world's democracies; they should follow Iowa's lead and immediately restore the right to vote to formerly incarcerated people."
