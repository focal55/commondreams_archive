<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">LONDON - June 20  - Africa is a massive $272 billion worse off as a result of ‘free’ trade policies forced on the continent as a condition for receiving aid and debt relief. 

 

</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to new research from Christian Aid, poor countries in sub Saharan Africa have lost billions of dollars worth of business over the past twenty years after being forced to open their markets to imports. The amount Africa has lost is equivalent to a sum large enough to wipe out all Africa’s debt and enable every child in the world to be sent to school and vaccinated. 

 

</font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The report, ‘The Economics of Failure: The Real Cost of ‘Free’ Trade’ stands on its head the traditional pro-market argument that free trade automatically leads to growth and a way out of poverty. On the contrary we show that trade liberalisation has actually cost developing countries billions of dollars in lost income - money that could have been invested in health and education, used to develop new industrial capacity, or to make agriculture more productive. 

 

</font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">‘Whole countries would be much richer today if they had not been forced to open their markets. In the past 20 years trade liberalisation has cost Africa the same amount as it received in aid. The amount that Africa has lost could have wiped out Africa’s debt and sent every child in Africa and the rest of the world to school and vaccinated every baby on the continent,’ said Dr Melamed.

 

</font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">‘If new aid and debt relief comes with strings attached that require countries to liberalise trade, it may well do more harm than good. When they meet at Gleneagles,G8 leaders must agree to stop demanding harmful conditions as the price of aid and debt relief,’ she added.

 

</font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Christian Aid used economic modelling to work out what might have happened had trade not been liberalised. Using data from the World Bank, International Monetary Fund, United Nations and other academic studies it examined what trade liberalisation has meant for 32 countries, most in Africa but some in Asia and Latin America.
