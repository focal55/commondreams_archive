<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WINDSOR, ONTARIO -- April 5 --  Today, the Canadian government and automobile manufacturers signed a historic agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from automobiles by over 15 million tons by the end of 2010.* If implemented correctly, this reduction will be consistent with the first phase of the California  Clean Car Law (known as the Pavley Law).  This improvement will be made by using existing, cost effective technologies - like more efficient engines, smarter transmissions, and better aerodynamics.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;This agreement is a breakthrough because it will both cut global warming emissions in Canada, and set the stage for similar reductions in the United States, &quot; said Dan Becker, Washington Director of the Sierra Club's Global Warming Program.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Right now, California and seven eastern states either have, or are in the process of adopting clean car laws.  With the addition of Canada, one-third of the North American auto market will have to meet California's tougher emissions rules.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The automakers will find it financially impossible to make one clean set of cars for eight states and Canada and a dirty set for the rest,&quot; continued Becker.  &quot;Eight plus one equals 50.&quot;</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To ensure that the auto companies comply with their commitment, the Canadian government is setting milestones, and will step in with a regulatory backstop if the automakers fail to live up to their promise.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">With this agreement, the automakers unilaterally disarm from their long-standing position that they cannot make clean cars.  In fact, they have sued to overturn the California Clean Car Law which is the basis for Canada's action.  The auto companies are now in the awkward position of telling a judge that they cannot make the same cars in California that they will make in Canada.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;When it comes to dealing with automobile manufacturers, Canada is leading way,&quot; continued Becker.  &quot;Canada told automobile manufacturers what they needed to protect the health their citizens and environment, and said that they would not take no for an answer.&quot;</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Automakers have long claimed they cannot cut global warming emissions - and won't.  Now they are promising Canada that they will. The automakers have now lost their last excuse for inaction.  It is time for the automakers to bring the benefits of clean cars to Americans, and do in the U.S. what they have promised to do abroad.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We look forward to examining the fine print of the agreement,&quot; continued Becker.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The agreement would reduce greenhouse gas emissions from automobiles by 10 million tons between 2007 and 2010 and 5.3 million tons in 2010.</font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
