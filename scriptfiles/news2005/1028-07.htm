<p> WASHINGTON - The House Agriculture Committee missed an important opportunity to reform inequitable  agricultural subsidies today and chose instead to cut important  nutrition benefits for needy said international agency Oxfam  America. Needed anti-hunger programs like food stamps were not  saved from the Congressional chopping block, while the Committee  failed to make the necessary steps to begin the reform of  agricultural subsidy programs that hurt family farmers in the  U.S. and threaten the livelihoods of farmers in developing  countries. </p>
<p>   In the budget reconciliation effort, the Agriculture  Committees in both the House and the Senate were tasked to find  savings from mainly three programs: anti-hunger, conservation and  commodities. The House Agriculture Committee today voted to slash  all programs by a total of $3.7 billion dollars. The Senate  Agriculture Committee voted last week to slash conservation  programs, cut commodity payments by 2.5 percent but kept  anti-hunger programs at current levels. Both proposals now move  to the floors of the House and the Senate before reaching  conference.</p>
<p>   "The opportunity was there to reform a system rife with  loopholes that has allowed mega farms to collect subsidies that  exceed $1 million." said Charly Moore, legislative director for  Oxfam America. "What's worse is that not only did the Committee  take a pass on reforming subsides via budget reconciliation, they  slashed anti-hunger and conservation programs instead."</p>
<p>   Proposals of payment limits that could have been included in  the budget reconciliation process would have been an important  first step towards more equitable and sustainable farm program  and would have also protected essential nutrition and  conservation programs from deep cuts. Especially in the wake of  Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, it is important that Congress keep  funding key programs -- like food stamps -- at adequate levels.</p>
<p>   "The raw power-play that unfolded in Congress today led to the  decision that cuts should be made to programs that help poor  people and reward good stewardship of the land rather than  programs that subsidize large agribusiness," continued Moore. </p>
<p>   The House Agriculture Committee mirrored the Senate proposal  to eliminate the Step 2 program, which pays exporters and  domestic mills to purchase higher priced US cotton. "Step 2"  payments are highly concentrated among fourteen firms, four of  which collected more than $100 million each from taxpayers  between 1995-2003. This year, a WTO found the Step 2 program,  along with $3.2 billion in annual cotton subsidies and  $1.6 billion in export credits paid by the US in cotton and other  commodities, to be illegal under WTO rules, but Congress has yet  to initiate the necessary legislation to implement the ruling.   However, the Step 2 cut as proposed by the House and Senate  Agriculture Committees does not satisfy the WTO ruling because it  does not take into effect until August 2006.</p>
<p>   "Eliminating Step 2 is a solid step forward for the US, but  more is needed to fully comply with international commitments,"  continued Moore. "While the Administration has said they are  committed to ending trade distorting subsidies, both the House  and Senate Agriculture Committees do not seem poised to make a  similar commitment, instead signaling to US trade negotiators  that touching subsidies is off the table."</p>
