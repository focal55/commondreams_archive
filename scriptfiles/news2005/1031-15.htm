<p>WASHINGTON - October 31 - Earthjustice warned  today that President Bush's nomination of Judge Samuel Alito, Jr.  to a lifetime seat on the U.S. Supreme Court could threaten a  wide range of laws that safeguard the health and environment of  all Americans. </p>
<p>   &quot;With this nomination on Halloween, President Bush appears to  be giving a sweet treat to the radical right, and playing a nasty  trick on the vast majority of Americans,&quot; said Glenn Sugameli,  senior legislative counsel at Earthjustice. &quot;The entire country  knows that Judge Alito was hand-picked by the radical right after  they torpedoed the nomination of Harriet Miers.</p>
<p>   &quot;Earthjustice is extremely concerned that Judge Alito has  repeatedly sought to go even farther than the current Supreme  Court majority in restricting Congress' authority to allow  Americans to protect their rights in court, and to enact laws  that protect our health and environment.&quot;</p>
<p>   -- In Public Interest Research Group (PIRG) v. Magnesium  Elektron (MEI), Judge Alito joined in a 2-1 ruling gutting  citizens' access to courts under the Clean Water Act. Although  the Act authorizes &quot;any citizen&quot; to bring a &quot;civil enforcement  action&quot; against alleged polluters, the Third Circuit ruling  declared that PIRG did not have standing to sue because it had  not demonstrated that MEI's pollution resulted in serious harm to  the environment (reversing a rare $2.6 million fine handed down  by the trial court for MEI's violations of the Act). The majority  concluded that the Constitution denied Congress the authority to  pass a law allowing citizens access to courts in these  circumstances. Three years later, the Supreme Court essentially  reversed and rejected Judge Alito's analysis, ruling (in a 7-2  decision over a heated dissent by Justice Scalia) that &quot;the  relevant showing... is not injury to the environment, but injury  to the plaintiff.&quot; (Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw) </p>
<p>   -- In Chittester v. Department of Community and Economic  Development, Judge Alito wrote an opinion holding that the 11th  Amendment precluded state employees from suing for damages to  enforce their rights under the Family and Medical Leave Act. This  decision was effectively reversed by a 6-3 Supreme Court majority  in Nevada Department of Human Resources v. Hibbs in 2003. </p>
<p>   -- Judge Alito wrote a dissent in the U.S. v. Rybar case that  would have unjustifiably restricted Congress' authority under the  Commerce Clause, which is the basis for most federal  environmental laws. The majority opinion upheld a conviction  under the federal law prohibiting the transfer or possession of  machine guns, but Judge Alito would have ruled that the law was  unconstitutional. The Supreme Court refused to review the case. </p>
<p>   &quot;The Senate has a duty to ensure that the next Justice will be  committed to upholding these safeguards and protecting the rights  of all Americans,&quot; said Sugameli. &quot;It is essential that all  Senators recognize their responsibility to conduct a  comprehensive, in-depth review of the nominee's record and views  in deciding whether to confirm him to a lifetime seat on the  nation's highest court.&quot;</p>
