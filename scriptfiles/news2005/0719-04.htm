<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">LONDON -  July 19  - Since the London bombings the government has united around one central message: the bombings had nothing to do with the illegal invasion of Iraq. Prime Minister Tony Blair said the bombings were the result of an &#145;evil ideology&#146; and promised to continue his support for George Bush&#146;s &#145;war on terror&#146;.</font></p><p> </p><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The ICM poll in today&#146;s Guardian reveals how the government is losing the battle to convince the public that the responsibility for the attacks rests within the Muslim community. Two-thirds of people believe that the London bombings are linked to the Iraq war with 64% holding Tony Blair responsible and of those 33% saying that he was &#145;a lot&#146; responsible.</font></p><p> </p><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Tony Blair&#146;s refusal to accept his responsibility for putting Britain in the front line of terror attacks brings to mind the attempts of the Aznar administration in Spain to blame ETA for the bombings in Madrid. Both Blair and Aznar tried to deceive their people and both have been found out.</font></p><p> </p><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Far from being his finest hour Blair&#146;s response to the London bombings has confirmed his reputation as a man who is extremely cavalier with the truth. As Seumus Milne wrote last week, &#145;it is an insult to the dead to deny any link with Iraq.&#146; </font></p><p> </p><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On Saturday Stop the War will stage a dramatic re-enactment of the now infamous meeting in Downing Street that took place on July 23 2002 at which it was agreed to invade Iraq and that &#145;the facts&#146; [intelligence] would be made to fit the policy. This will take place in Whitehall opposite Downing Street at 2pm.</font></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p align="CENTER"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">###</font></p><!-- #EndEditable -->
