<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- January 4 --   House Republicans on Monday night reversed course and abandoned a proposal that would have made it harder to hold lawmakers accountable for unethical behavior and also dropped another rule that would have allowed a party leader to retain his position even if indicted.</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Common Cause is pleased with the changes and applauds our activists for letting your members of Congress know that you opposed the rules change aimed at protecting House Majority Leader Tom DeLay (R-TX) if he is indicted by a Texas grand jury. The Washington Post reports it was your phone calls and letters that prompted the GOP to reverse itself. Rep. J.D. Hayworth (R-Ariz.) told the paper that the GOP changed course in part because of complaints that members had heard back home. &quot;Constituents reacted,&quot; Hayworth said.</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But the Republicans left in place, and are expected to approve today, a second rule change that could effectively eliminate the ethics process in the House. The change would allow complaints to die from inaction in the Ethics Committee unless at least one Ethics Committee member breaks rank with his or her party to vote that an investigation is warranted. The Ethics Committee is made up of an equal number of Democrats and Republicans. Under the current system, an investigation is triggered within 45 days if the committee deadlocks on how to handle a complaint, as it often does. The proposed change would essentially assure that all complaints are dismissed, assuming that Members vote along party lines, as they typically do. The majority calls it the &quot;protection of innocence&quot; rule, Common Cause calls it the &quot;Party Protection Act,&quot; since no one will be investigated as long as Members vote along party lines.</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Common Cause commends also House Ethics Committee Chairman Joel Hefley (R-CO) for bravely issuing a statement opposing not only the rules changes, but the partisan process being used by House leaders to institute them. &quot;Ethics reform must be bipartisan and this package is not bipartisan,&quot; Hefley said in a statement. &quot;If the House is to have a meaningful, bipartisan ethics process, changes of this magnitude can be made-as they were made in 1997 and 1989-only after thoughtful, careful consideration on a bipartisan basis.&quot; Click here to read the full statement.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Clearly, Republicans were responding to pressure when they dropped the indictment rule and another provision to alter the House Code of Conduct. On Monday, Common Cause was one of eight government watchdog groups that make up the non-partisan Congressional Ethics Coalition, which held a press conference to condemn the proposed changes.</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At that press conference, Common Cause President Chellie Pingree urged all Republicans to vote against the changes, and urged Democrats not only to vote against them, but to also speak out against them. &quot;Members' silence on this vote will make them complicit with those who want to change the rules,&quot; Pingree said. Click here to read her full statement.</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">With a vote expected later today, Common Cause continues to urge its members to call their Members of Congress and urge them to vote against the &quot;Party Protection Act,&quot; a rule that assures no investigations will be started if the parties hang together and that threatens to grind to a halt an already lax House ethics process.<br></font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
