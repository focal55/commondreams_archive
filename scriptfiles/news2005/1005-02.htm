<p>WASHINGTON - Free Press 
and the Center for Media and Democracy (CMD) today called on Congress and the 
Justice Department to prosecute government officials who violated federal laws 
by purchasing favorable news coverage for the president's policies.<BR><BR>Last 
week, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) determined that the Bush 
administration broke the law when it used taxpayer dollars to disseminate 
&#8220;covert propaganda&#8221; in advance of the 2004 elections.<BR><BR>&#8220;This White House 
has a knack for evading prosecution,&#8221; said Robert W. McChesney, president of 
Free Press. "The only way for justice to be served is for thousands to stand up 
and demand that charges stick against an administration that has set aside more 
than a quarter billion dollars to push propaganda on the public.&#8221;<BR><BR>In a 
report released Sept. 30, the GAO found that the administration illegally used 
taxpayer dollars on covert propaganda, funneling money to commentator Armstrong 
Williams to tout Bush's education policies and hiring a public relations firm to 
produce video news releases (VNRs) and analyze media perceptions of the 
Republican Party. The investigation also dug up other instances of abuse, 
including a previously undisclosed case in which the Bush administration 
commissioned a newspaper article that praised the White House's role in 
promoting science education.<BR><BR>"For U.S. citizens to participate 
meaningfully in our democracy, they must know whether the news they receive is 
truly independent or the result of illegal, covert government propaganda,&#8221; said 
CMD senior researcher Diane Farsetta. &#8220;What the GAO report documents is no less 
than an assault on the integrity of journalism and the democratic 
process."<BR><BR>Free Press and CMD will deliver thousands of letters to the 
leaders of the Judiciary and Appropriations committees as well as Attorney 
General Alberto Gonzales, calling for prosecution of those responsible for 
"these crimes to the fullest extent of the law." <BR><BR>Throughout the year, 
Free Press and CMD have mobilized citizens to put a stop to government 
propaganda. In April, the groups mobilized more than 45,000 concerned citizens 
to urge the FCC to launch an investigation into the widespread use of 
government-sponsored VNRs. In response, the agency issued a public notice 
calling on all broadcasters and cable outlets to disclose the origin of VNRs 
used on their programs.<BR><BR>The organizations will continue to exert public 
pressure for full disclosure of all White House publicity expenditures using 
taxpayer funds.<BR><BR>&#8220;Without popular dissent, an emboldened White House will 
continue to throw up obstacles to full disclosure,&#8221; said Timothy Karr, campaign 
director of Free Press. &#8220;It is now up to the public to pressure our government 
to enforce the law and stop propaganda crimes.&#8221;
