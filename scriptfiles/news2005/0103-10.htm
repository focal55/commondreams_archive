<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- January 3 -- Green Party leaders today warned that the Democrats risk losing members to the Green Party if the Democratic Party retreats on abortion rights.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Greens charged that the Democratic Party's actions should be seen as further abandonment of its base, and as evidence that voters who care about human rights and freedoms should seek alternatives to the Democrats and Republicans at the polls.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The Democratic Party is counting on the belief of many of its members that they have nowhere else to go,&quot; said Morgen D'Arc, Co-founder and Co-chair of the National Women's Caucus of the Green Party of the United States.  &quot;Greens appeal to women's organizations and the multitudes of women and men who care: support the Green Party and our candidates.  Greens stand committed to the rights and concerns of women and the values of the majority of Americans who believe in a woman's right to control her own body and her right to a safe and legal abortion.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The warning from Greens came in response to statements from Democrats who want their party to reconsider its position on abortion rights in the wake of presidential candidate John Kerry's defeat in 2004.  </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Former Rep. Tim Roemer (D- Ind.), who opposes full freedom of choice, is running for chair of the Democratic National Committee with the support House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.).  Incoming Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) also opposes abortion rights.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The Democrats continue to sell out their principles in a disingenuous attempt to be a 'big tent' party,&quot; said Erika McDonald, California Green and co-founder of the Feminist Issues Group in San Francisco.  &quot;The Green Party strongly supports reproductive rights for all women, regardless of race, class, or geography.&quot; </font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
