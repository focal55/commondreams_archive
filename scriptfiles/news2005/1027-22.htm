<p>WASHINGTON - Today ExxonMobil, the world’s largest and most profitable private oil company, announced its 3rd quarter profits - a windfall $9.9 billion.  However, instead of using these earnings to help pay for the cost of rebuilding after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita - catastrophes that help fuel ExxonMobil’s record profits - ExxonMobil will spend millions of it on lobbyists working to cast false doubt on the facts of global warming and pushing to drill in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and along our coasts.

 

<p>The ExxposeExxon Campaign (www.exxposeexxon.com) and other concerned environmental and consumer groups have come together to call on ExxonMobil CEO Lee Raymond in a letter to forgo any tax breaks and subsidies his company is slated to received from Congress, and to have that money redirected to the rebuilding and cleanup costs in the Gulf.  While Hurricanes Katrina and Rita reduced refinery capacity in the Gulf, they also increased natural gas prices and refinery profit margins.  According to the Wall Street Journal, the higher profits that the oil companies get from higher energy prices will more than offset the lost production from the hurricanes.  ExxonMobil’s facilities did not suffer any significant damage in the hurricanes.

 

<p>Currently, Congress is considering how to cut billions from next year’s budget in order to offset the rebuilding and clean-up costs.  Some of the programs they are considering cutting include student aid, veteran’s benefits, and other programs that benefit the neediest Americans.  No member of Congress has proposed legislation to withdraw the tax breaks approved to the oil and gas industries - a total of $10.7 billion between 2005-2009 - and no oil company, including Exxon Mobil, has offered to turn them down. 

 

<p>Based on its history, ExxonMobil will not use its profits to promote a more sustainable energy future based on renewable energy and energy efficiency, or pay the $4.5 billion in punitive damages to the Alaskan communities and small businesses injured by the Exxon Valdez oil spill.
