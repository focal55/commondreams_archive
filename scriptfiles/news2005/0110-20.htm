<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- January 10 -- Speculation continues to swirl around whether Rep. Joel Hefley (R-CO), chairman of the House Ethics Committee, who last week stood up to his party to speak out against a GOP plan to weaken the House ethics system, will be replaced. Common Cause believes it is the absolute wrong time to bring in a new ethics chairman. </font></p><p></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">House Speaker Dennis Hastert (R-Ill) is reportedly looking for someone to replace Hefley, whose panel three times admonished House Majority Leader Tom DeLay (R-TX), much to the embarrassment and surprise of House leaders. Congressional aides tell the Washington Post that House leaders no longer trust Rep. Hefley to handle ethics cases that could embarrass Republican lawmakers.</font></p><p></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Congressman Hefley has shown himself to be a good chairman,&quot; said Common Cause President Chellie Pingree. &quot;He has shown that he knows his job, and is serious about doing it. He knows the process, and has the right instincts that this must be a bipartisan process. To replace him now would look like punishment for the work he has done.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There is some talk that Rep. Hefley will be replaced because his chairmanship is term-limited, but those term limits can be waived, and have already been waived for at least one other chairman, Rep. David Dreier (R-CA) of the Rules Committee. </font></p><p></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Common Cause is urging activists to call Speaker Hastert and tell him that punishing a member of Congress who has conscientiously done his job - even if it means opposing his party leaders - sends a bad signal. &quot;The American people will see right through this,&quot; Pingree said. &quot;If Rep. Hefley is replaced, the message will be clear: The House is now truly a partisan ethics-free zone.&quot;<br></font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
