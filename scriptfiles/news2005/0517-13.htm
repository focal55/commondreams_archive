<p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- May 17 -- Green Party leaders claimed that Democrats are supporting some of the most damaging and extreme agenda of the Republican Party, citing the unanimous Senate vote to institute a national identity card for all Americans.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We're moving towards a one-party system, with Democrats rubberstamping most Republican legislation,&quot; said David Cobb, the Green Party's 2004 presidential candidate.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Senate Democrats and Republicans, unanimously and virtually without debate, approved the 'Real ID Act.'  This legislation mandates electronic ID cards for all Americans in accord with Homeland Security Department specifications.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Greens called the Real ID Act, which was slipped into an otherwise uncontroversial spending bill, a major step towards universal surveillance, a violation of the right to privacy and freedom of mobility, an ineffective security measure, and a vicious attempt to blame undocumented immigrants for the nation's problems.  (Many Greens have supported other provisions in the bill, especially the increases in death benefits, life insurance, and payments for traumatic injury for U.S. service members.)</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Senate also voted unanimously on May 10 in favor of $82 billion in emergency appropriations for military expenses in Iraq and Afghanistan. </font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Greens have called for an immediate end to the occupation and are urging defeat for HR-1268, the National Defense Authorization Act, but predict overwhelming support for the bill from both Democrats and Republicans.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Green Party leaders noted that mainstream Democrats have long agreed with Republicans on numerous major issues, favoring antidemocratic supranational trade authorities (NAFTA, WTO, etc.), the war on drugs, the 1996 Antiterrorism and USA Patriot Acts, the death penalty, the 1996 Telecommunications Act, welfare reform that penalizes the poor, expanded drilling for oil in Alaska, bills privileging credit card and other financial corporations over working Americans &lt;<a href="http://www.gp.org/press/pr_2005_04_21.html" target="_new">http://www.gp.org/press/pr_2005_04_21.html</a>&gt;, and surrender of Congress's constitutional power to declare war to the White House.  Last month, Democratic Party national chair Howard Dean endorsed the continued U.S. occupation of Iraq.  (Greens take the opposite position on all these issues.)</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Democratic Party leaders have also rebuffed attempts within their own party to introduce national health insurance, repeal Taft-Hartley restrictions on workplace organizing, and grant statehood to the District of Columbia.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;When John Kerry scolds his fellow Democrats for supporting same-sex marriage and Howard Dean hopes that Bush's Iraq policy is 'incredibly successful', it's painfully clear that the U.S. lacks opposing leadership,&quot; said Pat LaMarche, Green candidate for Vice President in 2004.  &quot;Democracy demands an opposition party to challenge and debate the direction of our nation.  The U.S. is in grave peril with no voice but that of the administration, amplified by the Democrats.  That's why the Greens are the fastest growing political party in the country.&quot;</font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
