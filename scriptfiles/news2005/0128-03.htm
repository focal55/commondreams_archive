<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- January 28 -- The Brennan Center for Justice, the American Civil Liberties Union of Northern California, and the nonprofit advocacy groups Public Knowledge, the Center for the Public Domain, and the First Amendment Project filed an amicus brief today in Kahle v. Ashcroft, arguing that Congress? elimination of copyright renewal requirements in 1992 created serious First Amendment problems by radically shrinking the public? access to works that belong in the public domain.  </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The groups challenged a ruling last year by the U.S. District Court in San Francisco that renewal requirements were simply ?rocedural formalities,?rather than important substantive limits on copyright. For this reason, the district court dismissed the Kahle lawsuit. The plaintiffs in the case, represented by the Stanford Center for Internet &amp; Society, have appealed to the Ninth Circuit. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The amicus brief argues that copyright formalities ?erved free expression values by allowing works whose owners are not concerned with copyright protection at the outset, or who would not renew that protection after a limited term, to enter the public domain.?Eliminating these ?pt-in?requirements, the groups contend, has created many ?rphan?books, films and music recordings that would otherwise have entered the public domain, and whose owners often cannot even be found.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The plaintiffs in the case are the Internet Archive and Prelinger Associates, which publish public domain films and other materials online.  They estimate that if not for the elimination of renewal requirements, more than 85% of copyright-protected works would enter the public domain after the initial copyright term expired.  </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Marjorie Heins of the Brennan Center, who authored the amicus brief, commented:  ?ormalities such as the original notice, registration, and renewal requirements of copyright law had the very important purpose of making sure that the public domain would be constantly enriched by a steady influx of new works.? As the brief argues, the district court, which dismissed the Kahle suit, ?holly ignored the scope and real-world impact of the procedural changes that transformed American copyright law.?</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The full text of the amicus curiae brief in Kahle v.
