<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DARFUR - July 15 - In his inaugural address as the First Vice President of Sudan on 9/7/05, Dr John Garang called for peace and dialogue to be restored to the country.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Under the banner of &quot;New Sudan&quot;, Garang hailed the inauguration as the start of the road to self-determination, popular consultation and full respect for human rights freedom and dignity, regardless of race, religion or gender. Additionally, he also called for the Sudanese people to build consensus, work to achieve good governance, equitable development and to eliminate corruption. In doing so, Garang expressed the hope that the natural resources of the country could be put to work for the benefit of the citizens of Sudan; that Sudan could be held up as a model for Africa and indeed the world.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Turning to the issue of Darfur he added that &quot;As a team of the Government of National Unity, we shall exert all our efforts to resolve the conflict in Darfur and the East as well as to address the grievances of the Far North and other parts of the country&quot;. He went on to say that trust should be rebuilt so that reconciliation could occur across ethnic, religious, cultural and political lines. He appealed for continued dialogue within and across all regions of the country including Darfur.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In Khartoum, Garang's speech was greeted with a good deal of optimism and hope for the future. In addition to these feelings of achievement, the lifting of the State of Emergency also suggest a new era of freedom and expression. Darfur Centre for Human Rights welcomes these moves and very much hopes that Dr Garang will be a positive force for peace and reconstruction in the Darfur Region as a whole.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Darfur Centre for Human Rights and Development is an organization established in the U.K in 2004.
