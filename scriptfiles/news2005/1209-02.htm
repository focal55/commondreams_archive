<p> WASHINGTON - December 9 - WHAT: A press conference will be held with Phil Donahue from 3:30 pm to 4:00 pm on Friday, December 9 at the Fireplace room in Hotel Albuquerque on 800 Rio Grande Blvd. NW.

 

<p><b>WHEN: </b><br>
Friday December 8, 2005 from 3:30 to 4:00 pm.

 

<p><b>WHERE:</b> <br>
Hotel Albuquerque (formally Old Town Sheraton) Fireplace Room at 800 Rio Grand Blvd NW.

 

<p><b>WHY:<br>
</b> Phil Donahue will deliver a keynote speech critical of corporate media at the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of New Mexico Annual Bill of Rights Dinner on Friday, December 9 at 7 p.m. at the Hotel Albuquerque in Old Town.

 

<p>In February, 2003, MSNBC cancelled Donahue's daily "liberal" talk show--the first of its kind--a mere six months after it debuted.  The network claimed poor ratings as the reason, but at the time, Donahue was the highest rated show on MSNBC.  His 440,000 viewers a night far exceeded viewer ship for the now long-running conservative MSNBC talk show "Hardball with Chris Matthews" and approached the numbers for "O'Reilly Factor."

 

<p>Donahue was interviewed by Sean Hannity of the FOX News channel’s Hannity & Colmes program the fall after he was fired from MSNBC.  “Well, we were the only antiwar voice that had a show, and that, I think, made them very nervous.  I mean, from the top down, they were just terrified.  We had to have two conservatives on for every liberal.  I was counted as two liberals.”  

 

<p>Public radio talk-show host Arcie Chapa will moderate the Friday event and hand out the awards.  ACLU-NM is honoring Bennett Hammer, Ousama Rasheed, Roger Smith, and Joyce Briscoe for their contributions to the ACLU of New Mexico.
