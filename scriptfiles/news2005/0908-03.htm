<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --> WASHINGTON - September 8 - The Human Rights Campaign President Joe Solmonese made the following statement in response to news that Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger will veto a bill that would extend marriage rights to California’s same-sex couples and their families.

<p>“With his veto, Governor Schwarzenegger adds a whole new group of people to the list of those who have no intention of re-electing him,” said HRC President Joe Solmonese. “He’s choosing the cynical side of politics instead of the right side of history.”

<p>Solmonese added, “People are looking for a governor with courage, conviction and the strength to do what is right. That means extending equality to all of California’s families, not appeasing the far right. Does the governor think that his or anybody’s marriage should be subjected to a vote? Public policy is about ensuring that the rights of everyone are secured. Californians want to see leadership and there is still time to show it.”

<p>Schwarzenegger has not yet vetoed the measure. In votes this month, the California Legislature passed A.B. 849, the Civil Marriage and Religious Freedom Protection Act. Authored by Assemblymember Mark Leno, D-San Francisco, and sponsored Equality California, passage of the bill marked the first time a marriage equality bill passed by a state legislature.
