WASHINGTON - November 3 - World Wildlife Fund has  two experts available to discuss avian flu, the impact to  wildlife and North American quarantine policies. </p>
<p>   The vice president of species conservation is available to  discuss avian flu's impact on wild bird trade and quarantine  policies for imported birds.  The deputy director of WWF's  conservation science program is available to answer questions  regarding the behavior of migratory birds and the potential  spread of avian flu along migratory routes. </p>
<p>   Avian Flu and Wildlife Trade </p>
<p>   &quot;Questions have arisen about the safety of birds imported for  the pet trade,&quot; said Ginette Hemley, WWF's vice president for  species conservation. &quot;But the public should know that birds  legally brought into the United States and Canada are subject to  a 30-day quarantine period, which is enough time to identify  diseased birds before they're cleared for import. Also, temporary  live bird import bans have been put into place from countries  experiencing avian flu outbreaks such as Indonesia and Thailand.  Illegal trade is a greater concern, as there is no way to impose  health restrictions on smuggled birds.&quot; </p>
<p>   Millions of wild-caught and captive-bred birds are traded  internationally each year through both legal and illegal  channels. In light of the outbreak of the HN51 avian flu strain  in Asia, WWF and TRAFFIC, the world's leading wildlife trade  monitoring group, support countries that wish to suspend imports  of both wild and captive-bred birds. But wildlife trade experts  warn that more must be done to reduce the level of illegal bird  trade, which could expand as legal trade is restricted. </p>
<p>   Avian Flu and Migratory Birds </p>
<p>   Experts do not have a clear picture of the role that migratory  birds play in the spread of this particular strain of avian flu  but it is possible that ducks, geese and wading birds could  spread HN51 along migratory routes. </p>
<p>   &quot;World Wildlife Fund does not believe that culling wild birds  is an effective control measure to stop the spread of avian flu.  Culls of wild birds are unlikely to stop the spread of avian flu  and culling could actually make the situation worse by dispersing  infected individuals and stressing healthy birds, making them  more prone to disease,&quot; said John Morrison, deputy director of  WWF's conservation science program.  &quot;The focus for now should be  on monitoring domestic poultry, minimizing the movement of  domestic poultry and keeping contact between domestic poultry and  wild bird populations to an absolute minimum."
