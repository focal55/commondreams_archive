<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - June 29 - As summer vacation kicks into full gear with the July Fourth holiday, some of America's greatest outdoor escapes are receiving national attention today with the release of America's Great Outdoors, Sierra Club's new report outlining a vision for protecting our natural heritage. The places profiled in the report were chosen by citizen conservationists in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico for the unparalleled recreational opportunities, clean water and wildlife habitat they provide.<br></font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The full report, list of places and a photo slideshow are available at <a href="http://www.sierraclub.org/greatoutdoors" target="_new">http://www.sierraclub.org/greatoutdoors</a><br></font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Protecting America's natural heritage means that we have to protect places big and small,&quot; said Carl Pope, Sierra Club Executive Director. &quot;America's Great Outdoors is Sierra Club's vision for our backyard treasures as well as national gems like the Arctic Refuge and Giant Sequoias. All of them are beautiful, all of them are threatened, and all of them can be saved.&quot;<br></font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the America's Great Outdoors report, people tell of their efforts to revitalize communities and keep them poison-free. Others focus on encouraging the implementation of clean energy sources to protect our coasts and wild places from drilling and free children and adults from the pollution that causes asthma, sewage-contaminated water and global warming. There are accounts of neighbors working to build communities where growth is well-planned to create more livable neighborhoods. There are people fighting to see that their taxes are invested wisely to benefit all -- not just developers or a favored few.<br></font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;All across America, communities are uniting to protect the neighborhood special places where they camp, hunt, hike, fish and find solace and solitude,&quot; said Pope. &quot;America's Great Outdoors outlines ways we can work together to make our neighborhoods safe and healthy places to live and highlights those natural treasures that can still be saved if we summon the foresight to act now.&quot;<br></font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The report highlights a variety of landscapes, from the famed Everglades in Florida to those best-kept secrets closer to home like Washington D.C.'s Anacostia River, Valle Vidal in New Mexico and Gulf Islands National Seashore off the Mississippi coast, whose cherished retreat and refuge are no longer guaranteed.<br></font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We are fast approaching the point where no place is sacred, where no part of America is safe from drilling, logging or development,&quot; said Pope. &quot;Across the country, Sierra Club is working with others to save open spaces, leave trees standing, keep communities intact, and connect citizens with their neighbors in order to care for our lands and wildlife.&quot;<br></font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In addition to highlighting 52 local treasures, the report addresses the overall threats to federally-protected places like National Parks, National Wildlife Refuges, National Monuments, National Forests and our coasts.<br></font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Adding the word 'National' to the name of a forest, park or seashore was once a certainty of protection. That is no longer true,&quot; the report reads.<br></font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On July 4th we celebrate our nation's birth as a Republic, a system of government designed to encourage and ensure public engagement on the issues and policies that affect them. By crafting such documents as the Declaration of Independence and the Bill of Rights, our nation's founders created a culture in which citizen activism is an act of patriotism.<br></font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The stories in America's Great Outdoors highlight the threats to national and neighborhood special places, and they show how powerful public participation can be,&quot; said Pope. &quot;Sierra Club members and others are continuing the legacy of democratic participation by working for positive solutions that ensure the protection and restoration of our natural heritage for future generations.&quot;<br></font></p><p></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
