<p>WASHINGTON - December 23 - A number of  Congressional leaders yesterday incorrectly sought to portray a  decision Wednesday to strip $2 billion in heating assistance  funds from the defense appropriations bill as being necessitated  by the Senate rejection of oil drilling in the Arctic National  Wildlife Refuge (ANWR).  The facts are clear, however, that the  removal of the Arctic drilling provision had no connection (other  than a political one) to the $2 billion in funding for the Low- income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) this winter and  that the decision to remove the energy assistance funds, made by  the Republican Congressional Leadership, was not necessitated by  the dropping of the ANWR provision, according to a new analysis  from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.</p>
<p>   The defense appropriations bill contained two provisions  related to LIHEAP funding.  One would have provided $2 billion in  additional funding for LIHEAP this winter.  The second provision  would, starting in 2008, have dedicated to LIHEAP a small  percentage of federal receipts from the Arctic drilling.  The  second LIHEAP provision was tied to the oil drilling.  The first  provision was not.  The Congressional Leadership elected to strip  out both of the LIHEAP provisions when the ANWR provision was  removed from the bill, a step that was unnecessary with regard to  the $2 billion in funding for this winter.  For a further  discussion of this matter, see the CBPP analysis "Senate Cuts  LIHEAP Funding," December 22, 2005: <a href="http://releases.usnewswire.com/redir.asp?ReleaseID=58664&Link=http://www.cbpp.org/12-22-">http://www.cbpp.org/12-22-</a> 05bud.pdf.</p>
<p>   Several Republican leaders yesterday made statements that  incorrectly claimed the removal of the ANWR provision  necessitated the removal of the $2 billion in LIHEAP funds.  The  Harrisburg Patriot-News reported that a spokesman for Sen. Rick  Santorum (R-Pa.), the chair of the Senate Republican Conference,  told the newspaper that "Democrats stripped out the $2 billion in  LIHEAP money because it would have been funded by revenues from  oil drilling in ANWR."  The claim that the $2 billion in funding  for this winter would have been financed by revenues from oil  drilling is false.</p>
<p>   Similarly, Sen. Charles Grassley (R-Iowa), chairman of the  Senate Finance Committee, was quoted in the Des Moines Register  as saying that when the drilling provision was defeated, it took  away the means to pay for the increase in utility assistance. And  Senator Judd Gregg (R-N.H.), chairman of the Senate Budget  Committee, was quoted in the Boston Globe as saying that the only  way Congress could have found extra money for the heating  assistance program was through a new revenue source such as  selling leases to the drilling rights in the Arctic refuge.   These statements are equally misinformed.</p>
<p>   Confusion on LIHEAP Funding Extends to Budget Reconciliation  Bill</p>
<p>   A final misstatement came yesterday from a spokesman for House  Speaker J. Dennis Hastert (R-Ill.).  The spokesman attacked  Senate Democrats for delaying passage of a separate piece of  legislation -- the budget reconciliation bill that would cut  Medicaid, student loans, child support enforcement, and other  programs -- by securing the removal on procedural grounds of a  few small provisions from the bill and thus necessitating another  vote on the bill in the House.  The Hastert spokesman, Ron  Bonjean, said this action would delay the provision of money to help low-income families pay their heating bills.   This statement, as well, has no basis in fact.  The only money for  heating assistance contained in the budget reconciliation bill is  funding for 2007.  The bill is drafted so that none of those  funds could be distributed this winter.</p>
