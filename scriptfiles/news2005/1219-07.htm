<p>   <b>WHO:</b> Center staff: </p>
<p>   -- Stacy Dean, director, Food Stamp Policy, Center on Budget &amp;  Policy Priorities </p>
<p>   -- Celia Hagert, senior policy analyst, Center for Public  Policy Priorities </p>
<p>   -- Jan Pruitt, executive director, North Texas Food Bank </p>
<p>   -- Eric Cooper, executive director, San Antonio Food Bank </p>
<p>   The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities and the Texas-based  Center for Public Policy Priorities will hold a conference call  briefing on Thursday, Dec. 22 at Noon ET (11 a.m. CT) to  discuss a decision by the Texas Health and Human Services  Commission that will cause poor Texas families to lose federally  funded food stamp benefits. </p>
<p>   The decision relates to an aspect of Texas' plan to stop  taking food stamp applications in person, and to take them by  phone and mail instead. The plan takes effect next month in  Austin and San Marcos and eventually will go statewide. </p>
<p>   Under federal law, eligible households receive food stamp  benefits starting from the date an application is submitted that  includes at least a name, date and signature.  Once an  application is approved, a household receives benefits  retroactive to the date of application. </p>
<p>   In reviewing the Texas plan, the U.S. Department of  Agriculture found a significant problem.  Because applications  need a signature, benefits would not start when a person applied  by phone; benefits would start only after a person called, the  state mailed an application, the person mailed back the  application, and the application was received. The result would  be a loss of benefits for the period between the phone request  and the return of a signed application, potentially a matter of  several weeks. </p>
<p>   USDA has told the state it would grant a waiver allowing  benefits to start from the initial phone call; all Texas has to  do is to submit a routine request, which USDA showed the state  how to do simply and quickly. But despite the fact that food  stamp benefits are fully federally funded, the state has declined  to request the waiver, which will cause Texas families to lose  food stamp benefits. </p>
<p>   After opening remarks, the panelists will take questions. </p>
