<p>WASHINGTON - December 15 - A controversial World Trade Organization services agreement that will be discussed at this week's WTO ministerial meeting in Hong Kong poses a serious threat to state and local authority over land use policy, according to a briefing paper released by Public Citizen.<br />
<br />

Johnson is state and local outreach coordinator for Public Citizen's Global Trade Watch division, which has just released the paper "Big Box Backlash: The Stealth Campaign at the World Trade Organization to Pre-empt Local Control Over Land Use." Johnson said today: "Major big box retail corporations have been eyeing the WTO's General Agreement on Trade in Services as a way of gutting local zoning and land use laws that have kept them out of communities in Europe and the United States. ... Wal-Mart is just one of the firms that have been lobbying both the U.S. government and the WTO on this issue."<br />

Milchen directs ReclaimDemocracy.org, a non-profit organization focused on restoring citizen authority over corporations. He wrote the recent article "Beyond Wal-Mart." Milchen said today: "Big box stores often ride roughshod over communities by running their own ballot initiatives when a town makes law that corporate executives dislike. Now they aim to pre-empt democracy entirely by using the WTO to override local decision-making authority. ... We need to recognize that Wal-Mart is merely the corporation most efficient at exploiting structural problems -- it's the symptom, not the disease. We need root-level changes to halt the growth of parasitic corporations like Wal-Mart and instead encourage business models that advance democracy, strong communities and widely shared economic prosperity."<br />

She said today: "As the tide of communities acting to curb big box sprawl swells, Wal-Mart and other mega-retailers are now looking to run an end-game around local authority by harnessing the power of the WTO."<br />
