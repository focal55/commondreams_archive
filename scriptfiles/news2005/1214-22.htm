<p>GUANTANAMO, Cuba - December 14 - A group of 21 US Christians are on their third day of a fast and prayer vigil outside of the US Naval Base at Guantánamo Bay as Pope Benedict makes a strong statement against human rights abuses. "The truth of peace must also let its beneficial light shine even amid the tragedy of war," said the Pope, “not everything automatically becomes permissible between hostile parties once war has regrettably commenced.” 

<p>The group awaits permission from US authorities to enter the base and visit the detainees. Thus far, attempts made by the group to communicate with the US Naval Base have been spurned by authorities there. The White House, on the other hand, claims that President Bush has no authority to grant access, proving meaningless Bush’s open invitation for those concerned about human rights abuses at Guantánamo to visit the base (June 20, 2005).

<p>This morning the Christians ascended a mountain overlooking the base and held a two-hour prayer vigil.

<p>Three members of the group, Jackie Allen, Anna Brown and Patricia Santoro returned to the United States Tuesday night and are available for interviews.
