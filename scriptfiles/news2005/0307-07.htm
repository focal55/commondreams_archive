<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">TAMPA, FL -- March 7 -- On behalf of Parents, Families and Friends of Lesbians and Gays (PFLAG) and the Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network (GLSEN), the National Center for Lesbian Rights (NCLR) is demanding a public retraction and apology from the Pinellas County Juvenile Welfare Board (JWB) in response to defamatory statements made by board member Cecilia Burke. NCLR cooperating attorney Carl Schuh is co-counsel on the case.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In a written memorandum addressed and circulated to the entire JWB on February 7, 2005, Burke stated that GLSEN and PFLAG &quot;endorse unhealthy sexual practices among youth, including sex between underage youth and adults.&quot; This statement is false.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;This outrageously irresponsible memo is false, scandalous and defamatory, and it is damaging to our clients' reputations,&quot; said NCLR attorney Karen Doering. &quot;We cannot allow such slanderous and absurd characterizations to go unchallenged and we are prepared to pursue every legal avenue available to hold the Juvenile Welfare Board accountable.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The groups issued a demand letter to the JWB on March 4 insisting that the JWB immediately retract the false and defamatory statements and write a formal letter of apology, and that Cecilia Burke read the retraction and apology into the record at the next JWB meeting. In addition, the letter requests that the JWB &quot;reaffirm its commitment to promoting, promulgating and using age appropriate and medically accurate information, materials and training regarding health and juvenile welfare.&quot; The letter gives the JWB 10 days to comply with the demands before further legal action is initiated. GLSEN and PFLAG reserve all rights regarding further legal action should the JWB not be responsive.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;GLSEN staff, volunteers and student organizers from across the country are working hard to ensure schools are safe places for all students,&quot; said GLSEN Founder and Executive Director Kevin Jennings. &quot;We cannot and will not allow irresponsible comments to mischaracterize, demean and undercut all of their hard work.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;For more than 30 years, PFLAG has helped families understand that their gay and lesbian loved ones are fine just as they are. By doing so, we save families and save lives,&quot; said Ron Schlittler, Interim Executive Director. &quot;We could not let these misinformed, hurtful and unjustified comments by a public official in a public document simply pass. In fact, the viciousness of this attack required that we take this course of action to preserve the truth: first and foremost, PFLAG cares about children and their families.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Parents, Families and Friends of Lesbians and Gays (PFLAG) is the nation's foremost national family-based organization committed to the health, well-being and civil rights of gays, lesbians, bisexual and transgender persons.
