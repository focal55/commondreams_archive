<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON -- May 6 -- Today is the legal deadline for the White House to comply with our April 8 request made under the Freedom Of Information Act.  The White House by law has 20 business days to respond, and those 20 days will expire at the close of business today.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In our legal request to the White House, we said two things:</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">1)That the White House must not destroy any documents or information pertaining to the removal of my clients from President Bush's March 21 event.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">2)That under the Freedom of Information Act, we request that all disclosable documents or information pertaining to the removal of my clients be turned over to us.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Here's why this request is relevant.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Ultimately, we want to know WHO RECRUITED staffers for this presidential event, WHO TRAINED event staff to screen and remove citizens based on viewpoint, and WHO DIRECTED event staff to actually eject my clients.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It is indeed very mysterious that the Mystery Man in question originally confronted my clients, let them into the event, and then came running back 20 minutes later to kick them out.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Something happened in those Mystery 20 Minutes.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Someone told that mystery event staffer what to do. Someone was giving him directions &#150; either directly or through his earpiece.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Who was giving these directions will be a vital detail in any future lawsuit concerning the violation of my client's constitutional First Amendment rights at this event.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So pursuant to our legal request for information, we want an assurance from the White House that they did not destroy evidence.  In addition, we want all disclosable information turned over to us.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now, we intentionally requested all DISCLOSABLE information because obviously there will be some information &#150; such as non-uniformed Secret Service staffers who were in the audience that day who witnessed the events &#150; that it may be inappropriate to make public.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But, the White House must not be allowed to pull the wool over our eyes and hide behind the Secret Service's ongoing criminal investigation into this matter to avoid giving any details about who RECRUITED, TRAINED, AND DIRECTED event staff to remove my clients.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The people we sent this Freedom of Information Act request to knew the answers to most of our questions about who recruited, trained, and directed event staffers before the start of any investigation.  We want that information.  </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If the Secret Service has learned something additional through its investigation in the last week or so, fine; let them withhold that until the investigation is through. But the White House must not be allowed to hide the truth and be evasive by falsely claiming that now everything is confidential.  Were the government able to hide already known information simply by &quot;starting a new investigation&quot; then the Freedom Of Information Act would be useless and the public would never be able to find out what its public servants know.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Furthermore, we will not be fooled by excuses because Scott McClellan, the White House Press Secretary, ALREADY GAVE DETAILS about who kicked out my clients and why.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The problem is, the details given by Scott McClellan were a lie.  We want the truth.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On Wednesday, April 27, a White House reporter asked McClellan the following question, &quot;Back on March 21st, the President was in Denver doing an event. At that event three Denver residents were removed by somebody working on behalf of the President who is now being investigated for impersonating a Secret Service officer. I understand the White House knows who this person is. Will you tell us who this is? And will you, more importantly, explain what role the White House has in recruiting and training volunteers at these events? Is the White House encouraging people to screen or expel people from the President's events based on their point of view?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Mr. McClellan proceeded to mislead reporters.  He repeated four times that a &quot;volunteer&quot; removed my clients.  He gave the impression to reporters and the public that the person who forcibly removed my clients was acting without authority or direction from the White House.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But the very next day, McClellan was directly disputed by two very credible sources in this context &#150; the Secret Service and the Colorado Republican Party.  When asked about the Mystery Man, the Secret Service confirmed it was, &quot;A Member of the Republican staff host committee.&quot;  When asked who the host committee was, a spokesperson for the Colorado Republican Party, said, &quot;The White House is the host committee.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If an official White House event staffer acted under orders to violate my clients' constitutional rights, that has enormous legal implications.  If it was part of a larger White House policy, that would also have legal ramifications for citizens excluded from similar presidential events in Arizona, North Dakota, and New Hampshire.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As our Freedom Of Information Act request comes due today, we are demanding that the White House stop the stonewalling.  We want assurance that no evidence has been destroyed, and we want all legally-required information turned over immediately.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Thank you</font></p>
