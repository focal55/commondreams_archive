<p>WASHINGTON - December 20 - The Brady Center to  Prevent Gun Violence announced today that it is opposing the  nomination of Judge Samuel Alito to the U.S. Supreme Court.  This  is the first time the Brady Center has opposed a Supreme Court  nomination.</p>
<p>   Judge Alito's nomination poses serious dangers to the safety  of our communities, our families, and our children, as evidenced  by his troubling dissent in U.S. vs. Rybar, 103 F.3d 273 (3rd  Cir. 1996).  In that case, Judge Alito argued that the federal  machine gun ban amounted to an unconstitutional exercise of  Congressional power under the Commerce Clause.  Alito attempted  to erect arbitrary hurdles to Congressional efforts to reduce the  availability of machine guns to the criminal element.  </p>
<p>   In unusually harsh language, the Rybar majority criticized  Alito's dissent as having "no authority" in the law and  "run(ning) counter to the deference that the judiciary owes to  its two coordinate branches of government...."  If Judge Alito's  dissent were to be adopted by the Supreme Court, it would place  in jeopardy the ability of Congress to protect the public from  gun violence.</p>
<p>   Dennis Henigan, Director of the Brady Center's Legal Action  Project, remarked, "Judge Alito's conclusion that the federal  machine gun ban is unconstitutional is right-wing judicial  activism at its worst.  He demonstrated no respect for the  judgment of Congress in seeking to protect the public from the  grave dangers of fully automatic weapons."</p>
<p>   In addition to being the dissenting view in the Third Circuit,  Judge Alito's conclusion that the machine gun ban violates the  Commerce Clause is so far out of the mainstream of Constitutional  jurisprudence that it has been rejected by every other federal  appellate court that has considered the issue, including the  Second, Fifth, Sixth, Seventh, Eighth, Ninth, Tenth and Eleventh  Circuits. The Supreme Court has been asked to review lower court  decisions upholding the ban six times and has declined in each  case.  In June 2005, the Supreme Court issued its latest ruling  on Congressional power under the Commerce Clause in Gonzales vs.  Raich, rejecting the theory advanced in Judge Alito's Rybar  dissent.  Six Justices, including Justice Scalia, sustained the  application of federal drug laws to intrastate medical marijuana  use.  Based on this ruling, the Supreme Court vacated a  2-1 ruling in the Ninth Circuit that had declared the machine gun  ban to be unconstitutional.</p>
<p>   Senators have expressed concerns about Judge Alito's judicial  activism in the Rybar case, including Republican Sen. Tom Coburn  of Oklahoma.  In a Nov. 6, interview on Meet the Press, Sen.  Coburn was asked about Alito's dissent in Rybar, and Coburn  agreed with the Brady Center that it represented improper  judicial activism.  Coburn stated, "Those aren't decisions judges  should be making.  Those are decisions legislators should be  making. And that's how we've gotten off on this track is, that we  allow judges to start deciding the law...."  Sen. Coburn went on  to state that Alito's Rybar opinion was "wrong" and amounted to  "legislating" from the bench.</p>
<p>   In the Rybar case, Raymond Rybar, Jr., a federally licensed  gun dealer, attended a gun show in Monroeville, Pennsylvania on  April 4, 1992.  He possessed a fully automatic Chinese Type 54,  7.62-millimeter submachine gun, which he sold to Thomas  Baublitz.  The next day Rybar returned to the gun show and sold  Baublitz another fully automatic firearm, a U.S. Military M-3,  .45 caliber submachine gun.  The guns were sold for a total of  $600.  Rybar pleaded guilty to two counts of unlawfully  possessing a machine gun, with the condition that he be allowed  to appeal to allege that the federal machine gun possession  restrictions were unconstitutional.  If Judge Alito had prevailed  in the Rybar case, Raymond Rybar, Jr. would have been set free.</p>
<p>   Machine guns are fully automatic weapons that have been  heavily regulated since 1934. They fire continuously with one  pull of the trigger and can discharge hundreds of rounds in  seconds.  In 1986, President Reagan signed a federal law banning  the manufacture of machine guns for the civilian market and  banning the transfer and possession of machine guns not lawfully  possessed before May 19, 1986.  These "grandfathered" machine  guns remain subject to strict registration, possession, transfer,  and taxation requirements.  </p>
