<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->TRENTON, New Jersey - New Jersey state officials are deliberately ignoring 
            mounting evidence of serious health threats to populations 
            surrounding scores of contaminated sites, according to documents 
            released today by Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility 
            (PEER). State sampling data show that individual cancer risks from 
            continued presence of airborne chromium exposure to chromium may be 
            as high as 1 in 10 at some sites the state has declared to be 
            clean.</P>
            <P>Zoe Kelman, a New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection 
            chemical engineer and member of the state&#8217;s official Chromium 
            Workgroup has filed a report with the DEP Commissioner showing that 
            harmful chromium is migrating off completed (&#8220;remediated&#8221;) sites and 
            likely coming into direct contact with residents and workers. Ms. 
            Kelman says the Workgroup failed to consider the work of scientific 
            experts or to examine whether state chromium cleanup standards and 
            &#8220;caps&#8221; are adequately protective.</P>
            <P>These continuing failures echo the recent federal court decision 
            in <I>ICO v. Honeywell</I>, where the Court found an &#8220;imminent and 
            substantial risk&#8221; to public health in Jersey City and that industry 
            consultants unduly influenced and delayed the DEP cleanup program. 
            Ms. Kelman and PEER are requesting intervention by the U.S. 
            Environmental Protection Agency because the state has signaled that 
            it does not intend to comply with federal standards.</P>
            <P>In 2004, state scientists found that state clean-up standards 
            were deficient and significantly underestimated the health risks at 
            chromium sites. DEP had already approved &#8220;caps&#8221; and incomplete 
            cleanup plans at some of these sites, based on these flawed 
            standards. Rather than accept these findings, DEP Commissioner Brad 
            Campbell convened a &#8220;Chromium Workgroup&#8221; that included Ms. Kelman. 
            Campbell narrowed the scope of the investigation, by directing the 
            Workgroup not to question whether the state cleanup standards and 
            &#8220;cap&#8221; based cleanup approach were adequate.</P>
            <P>&#8220;In one of the many workgroup meetings in which I participated,&#8221; 
            Ms. Kelman wrote, &#8220;a question was asked of staff members that 
            unexpectedly touched a nerve: &#8216;Would you live beside one of the 
            chromium sites that has been cleaned up using current DEP 
            standards?&#8217; This co-worker, who had approved many of the cleanups 
            using these criteria, gave what seemed to be a reluctant but honest 
            answer: &#8216;Probably not.&#8217; Based on the extensive studies and data that 
            I reviewed as part of this workgroup and afterwards, I would have 
            emphatically answered &#8216;NO&#8217; to that question. I would not expose my 
            family to avoidable and serious health risks by living or working on 
            or near a chromium waste site that was remediated under DEP&#8217;s 
            current criteria.&#8221;</P>
            <P>The basic problem with DEP&#8217;s approach is that it relies on the 
            polluter to decide what type of incomplete &#8220;cap&#8221; &#8220;clean-up&#8221; is 
            appropriate, without allowing the community to be made aware of or 
            consider whether more protective alternatives, including permanent 
            remedies, are appropriate. Legislation has stripped NJDEP of the 
            power to order a responsible company to conduct a &#8220;feasibility 
            study&#8221; to examine cleanup options; to conduct public hearings on 
            those options; or to order permanent remedies that provide reliable 
            health protections.</P>
            <P>&#8220;Thanks to the courage and integrity of a DEP specialist speaking 
            out, it is clear that New Jersey has abdicated its responsibility to 
            protect the public from toxic sites,&#8221; stated Bill Wolfe, a former 
            long-time DEP analyst. &#8220;Unfortunately, federal intervention will be 
            necessary to make sure that this job is done right.&#8221;</P>
            <P>The PEER-Kelman letter asks that U.S. EPA intervene to require 
            the state to comply with the Clean Water Act, Superfund and other 
            federal toxic waste laws that apply to the state's chromium 
            sites.</P>
