<p>WASHINGTON - September 20 - Seven leaders in the movement to
reform the U.S. election system discussed measures to
protect the right to vote, in a panel at the National
Press Club in Washington, D.C. on Friday, September
16.

<p>Titled "A Call to Protect and Democratize U.S.
Elections: A Panel Presentation on the challenges to
American elections," the event was sponsored by the
Green Institute, the Liberty Tree Foundation for the
Democratic Revolution, and FairVote -- The Center for
Voting & Democracy.

<p>SUMMARY OF PRESENTATIONS

<p>
<ul>
<li>Patrick Barrett of the Liberty Tree Foundation for
the Democratic Revolution
<http://www.libertytreefdr.org>, in his introductory
remarks as moderator, looked forward to a "new
generation voting rights movement, the latest in a
long and honorable tradition in the U.S." . Juan Cartagena, General Counsel for the Community
Service Society in New York <http://www.cssny.org>,
stressed the continued viability of the 1964 Voting
Rights Act, especially for Latinos, who represent the
largest growing ethnic population.  He discussed the
historical use of literacy tests to bar not only
African Americans, but also Latinos, and noted that
'Voter ID' laws are now being used to restrict access,
as in Georgia, which now mandates a specific form of identification that is only available in 59 sites around the state, with no site in Atlanta.<br>
</li>
<li>Rep. Jesse Jackson, Jr. (D-Ill.) <www.house.gov/jackson> said that the national right
to vote must now be enacted through a new amendment to
the U.S. Constitution, in light of alleged
irregularities in the 2000 and 2004 elections and the
Supreme Court's Bush v. Gore decision (2000). "The
U.S. Supreme Court, including [nominated Chief Justice
John] Roberts, are having an increasing problem in
identifying a right to vote," said Rep. Jackson.

Rep. Jackson noted that the Court identifies the right
to vote as a state's right, not a national guarantee. 
As a result, state- and county-based election systems
are inherently "separate and unequal." He reminded
listeners that it took 16 presidents to bring the U.S.
to the point where it recognized that African
Americans are full citizens who deserve the right to
vote, and another 17 presidents to reach the point
where this right was enforced (through the Voting
Rights Act, signed by President Johnson). <br>
</li>
<li>Terry Ao, Senior Attorney of the National
Asian-Pacific American Legal Consortium <http://www.napalc.org>, talked about the importance of Section 203 of the Voting Rights Act, which enacts a right to language assistance at the polls for those who need it.  Ms. Ao said that technology that helps voters overcome language barriers would bring such sites into compliance with Section 203, and would also benefit people with various disabilities.<br>
</li>
<li>Rob Richie, executive director of FairVote -- The
Center for Voting & Democracy <http://www.fairvote.org>, claimed that 18th century
electoral laws and structures have acted as barriers
to free and fair elections.  For example, the
Electoral College system has turned some states into "battlegrounds" and rendered other states uncompetitive in national elections, with as much as a 10% higher turnout in battleground states.  Mr. Richie called for various reforms, including instant runoff voting, proportional representation, and cumulative voting. </li>
</ul>
<p>"Nearly every other modern democracy has already had
this discussion," said Mr. Richie (who filled in for
FairVote chair John Anderson, who wasn't able to
attend because of health reasons).

<p>
<ul>
<li>Linda Schade, Co-Founder and Spokesperson of
TrueVoteMD <http://www.truevotemd.org>, agreed with
Ms. Ao that computer voting machines have held promise
for increased access, but have also been used to
subvert voting rights, eliminate transparency, and
manipulate outcomes.  In Maryland, reliability
problems were found in Diebold machines: ability to
tamper, defective parts, crashes, and lost data.  Some precincts were shut down.</li>
</ul>
<p>"Voters were having significant problems, while -- as
in the coverage of Katrina -- media reported that
everything went smoothly," said Ms. Schade. 
Furthermore, the cost of elections in Maryland has
skyrocketed, initially $7 million for computer voting
machines, now over $100 million.

<p>
<ul>
<li>David Cobb, the Green Party's 2004 presidential
nominee, said that the major decisions are now made
according to the interests of corporate elites. "We
need to democratize the U.S.A....  Systemic change
requres a broad social movement." Mr. Cobb called
collective action and alternative political parties
essential, noting that alternative parties championed
the abolition of slavery, women's suffrage, direct
election of U.S. senators, the end of child labor, and
many other reforms. </li>
</ul>
<p>Mr. Cobb, who initiated the Ohio and New Mexico
recount efforts in 2004 <http://www.votecobb.org>,
noted that 40% of Americans believe that President
Bush may have stolen the 2000 and 2004 elections,
revealing a crisis of confidence in U.S. democracy. 
He cited examples of vote obstruction, especially of
those cast by African Americans and students.

<p>"The ability to cast a vote and have it counted is at
the very core of representative democracy," said Mr.
Cobb, who noted that reauthorization of the Voting
Rights Act has been opposed by the leadership of both
major parties.  He recalled that a 'Clean Elections'
plan was passed in Massachusetts through a citizens' referendum, but the majority-Democrat state legislature refused to fund it, thus overturning it.

<p>Mr. Cobb repeated Mr. Barrett's call for a new voting
rights movement, one that pays homage to the Civil
Rights movement.  "We the People have more power than
we can imagine, if we only dare exercise it."

(Melanie Campbell, Executive Director of the Coalition for Black Civic Participation, was not able to
participate because of a last-minute conflict.)
