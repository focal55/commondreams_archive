<p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- March 18 -- Reps. Jim McDermott (D-Wash.) and Pete Stark (D-Calif.), both military veterans, and Rep. Lynn Woolsey (D-Calif.), ranking Democrat on the Education Reform Subcommittee of the House Education and Workforce Committee, joined the Punk activist band Anti-Flag for the launch of its national drive to restore privacy to student records in schools.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Under a provision in the No Child Left Behind law, schools are required to provide private student contact information to military recruiters, or face the loss of federal funds.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Rep. Lynn Woolsey said, &quot;Schools should be able to invite military recruiters to their campuses, but must not be forced to give military recruiters contact information about their student body.&quot;</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Justin Sane, lead singer for the band, said, &quot;It's time that leaders making laws that affect us hear from us. How can anyone wonder why young people mistrust so many adults when a law gets passed that invades young people's privacy without even their knowledge or consent?&quot;</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Section 9528 of NCLB grants a military recruiter access to private student contact information unless students, parents or guardians opt-out in writing. The Band has launched <a href="http://www.militaryfreezone.org/" target="_new">http://www.militaryfreezone.org</a> , which provides resources and information on how to opt out, and the band will gather signatures calling for NCLB to be amended to restore student privacy.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Not only has No Child Left Behind been shortchanged by the war in Iraq, now we learn the military is using it for an immoral recruitment scheme,&quot; said Rep. Pete Stark. &quot;No Child Left Behind is supposed to be about student achievement, not military recruiting.&quot;</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">McDermott added, &quot;I support our military, but young people, not government, should make the decision about whether to explore a military career.&quot;</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Militaryfreezone.org will build on the voter registration and activism that recently ignited so many young people to become involved in politics; in particular the anti-militarization movement that many young people are now a part of,&quot; Sane said.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">PHOTO EDITORS: A high resolution, publication-ready photograph supporting this story is available for free editorial use at: <a href="http://www.wirepix.com/cgi-bin/newsphotos/download.cgi?image=USN031805aa.jpg" target="_new">http://www.wirepix.com/cgi-bin/newsphotos/download.cgi?image=USN031805aa.jpg</a></font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">An archive of this and more than 1,000 news photos is available at: <a href="http://www.wirepix.com/newsphotos/" target="_new">http://www.wirepix.com/newsphotos/</a>.</font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
