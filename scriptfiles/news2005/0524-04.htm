An increased number of governments [2] are now understood to be using the the WTO's non-agricultural market access (NAMA) negotiations [3], to make a breath-taking total of 212 challenges to the laws of other countries. This sweeping attack on government policy-making is now known to also include challenges to the following measures [4]:</font></p><ul><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">     Policies that promote energy efficiency in household appliances,      air conditioning units and heating (China, which lists a range of      EU directives);</font><br></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> the European Union's CE Marking scheme (which ensures imports      comply with the essential requirements of EU health, safety and      environmental protection laws) (China);</font><br></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> the Australia Heart Foundation's 'Tick' Scheme which approves      healthy food products (Malaysia);</font><br></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> requirements to label canned and processed seafood products if      they have more than 1% genetically-modified ingredients (Thailand);</font><br></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">restrictions on trade in wild animals and products made from them      (China, but India also says /&quot;These [animal rights] campaigns      could have various motivations not necessarily based on truth&quot;/);</font><br></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">measures used to implement International Organization for      Standardization's ISO 14000 and ISO 8000 standards - on      environmental management systems and working conditions      respectively (India);</font><br></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">in relation to forestry, building codes and safety standards,      measures designed to assist small farmers, government subsidies      for education, training and forest research (New Zealand);</font><br></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> restrictions on the use of heavy metals, such as cadmium, lead and      chromium in the production of electronic appliances (Thailand); and</font><br></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> certain trade measures used to implement the Convention on Trade      in Endangered Species (CITES) (the Philippines) and the Montreal      Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer (Malaysia).<br></font></li></ul><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;It's quite incredible that WTO members could have spent three years quietly developing this wish-list of national laws that businesses would like to see swept aside, seemingly oblivious to the public outrage that will inevitably result. The NAMA negotiations finally expose the WTO for what it is - an institution set up specifically to promote a corporate development agenda.&quot;/ said Ronnie Hall of Friends of the Earth International.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>FOR MORE INFORMATION CONTACT:<br>In the UK, Ronnie Hall, Friends of the Earth International +44 1243 <br>602756 or email <a href="mailto:ronnieh@foe.co.uk" target="_new">ronnieh@foe.co.uk</a><br>In Brussels, Alexandra Wandel, Friends of the Earth Europe +49 172 748 <br>3953 or email <a href="mailto:alexandra.wandel@foeeurope.org" target="_new">alexandra.wandel@foeeurope.org</a><br>In Washington DC, David Waskow, Friends of the Earth US +1 202 222 0716 <br>or email dwaskow@foe.org<br>In Montevideo, Alberto Villarreal Friends of the Earth Uruguay <br>+598-5228481 or email <a href="mailto:comerc@redes.org.uy" target="_new">comerc@redes.org.uy</a></i></font></p><p align="LEFT"><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">[1] The original FOEI analysis focused on government notifications made in 2004 and 2005.
