<p>WASHINGTON - November 9 – James Brady. Chair of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, released the following statement Tuesday night:

<p>“The people have spoken in Virginia and New Jersey, and they have elected candidates who have stuck to reasonable positions when it comes to sensible gun policies.

<p>“America’s news media should pay heed: arch-conservative, guns above all else positions have been shown to be a losing recipe.  Jerry Kilgore, in Virgina, said he wanted guns in bars and no limits on gun traffickers.  In New Jersey, Doug Forrester reversed his earlier pro-gun lobby positioning, but the people of New Jersey were wary nevertheless. 

<p>“This is a sign of where America is going.  The National Rifle Association got a ‘wake up and smell the coffee’ message tonight.  Their agenda has been rejected by the voters in two major states.  They need to pay attention to the shift in the political winds.”
