<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->CRAWFORD, Texas  - August 15 -  Mothers to invite President Bush to pray for the troops with them at camp this Friday.

<p>On Monday, the moms who are camping outside of President Bush's Crawford ranch demanding answers to why their sons died in Iraq, and the Iraq war veterans who've joined them, will announce their plan to keep the pressure on President Bush to meet with them.

<p>At the event, Cindy Sheehan and members of other military families will invite President Bush to join them in prayer at what's been dubbed "Arlington Crawford," a patch of grass outside his ranch with white crosses representing the soldiers who’ve lost their lives in Iraq.

<p>Mothers are scheduled to take part in candlelight vigils across the country beginning Wednesday night. These mothers are supporting the Crawford moms in their demand for a meeting with the president to answer questions as why their sons were killed.

<p>The vigils are being organized by a coalition of groups including MoveOn.org Political Action, TrueMajority and Democracy For America.

<p>WHEN: 10:30 a.m. CDT

<p>WHERE: Camp Casey
