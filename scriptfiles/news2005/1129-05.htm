<p>WASHINGTON - November 29 - The battle over Social Security was determined by more than mistakes by President Bush and GOP leaders.  A newly-energized progressive network mobilized millions of Americans to seriously discuss and debate the idea of privatization -- and to demand that their Senators and Members of Congress tell their constituents where they stood.  This new political force has turned its organizing efforts to the budget battle now, but will re-focus on letting voters know where their representatives stood on Social Security and Medicare in the election year to come.  Please come to hear a discussion of what this new force represents.  
<p>   Please join the Campaign for America's Future for a provocative discussion: </p>
