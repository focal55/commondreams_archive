<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->WASHINGTON - September 8 - ACORN, the nationwide  community group, released a report today showing serious racial  inequalities at Wells Fargo, the second largest mortgage lender  in the country. The report found that Wells Fargo charged  African-Americans and Latinos higher interest rates than whites.
<p>   Nationally, African-Americans who got a loan from Wells Fargo  Bank or Wells Fargo Home Mortgage were four times more likely  than whites to receive a high rate subprime loan, and Latinos  were almost twice as likely as whites to get a high cost loan.</p>
<p>   The report, &quot;A Case of Black and White,&quot; examined the 2004  Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) for Wells Fargo in all fifty  states, as well as for fifty metropolitan areas.  Among the  findings are that:</p>
<p>   -- In Washington, DC, African-Americans were thirty times more  likely than whites to receive a subprime loan.  One out of every  eight mortgages made to African-Americans was a high rate loan,  compared to just one out of every 227 mortgages made to whites.</p>
<p>   -- In the Los Angeles metropolitan area, Latinos were six  times more likely than whites to receive a high cost subprime  loan. One out of every eleven loans to Latinos was a subprime  loan, compared to just one out of every sixty-one loans made to  whites.</p>
<p>   &quot;This backs up what we have been saying all along,&quot; said  ACORN's National President Maude Hurd.  &quot;Wells Fargo has been  preying on communities of color and charging us higher rates and  fees.&quot;</p>
<p>   In 2003, ACORN launched a national campaign to shed light on  Wells Fargo's abusive lending, to force them to change their  predatory practices, and to win some compensation for the  borrowers they had harmed.</p>
<p>   Although Wells Fargo has denied they engage in predatory  lending, they have gradually been making the changes that ACORN  demanded, including a set of changes the lender announced just  last week.</p>
<p>   &quot;ACORN members around the country who have been fighting Wells  Fargo's predatory lending practices are glad that the company has  finally acknowledged the damage their practices have caused and  has agreed to change them,&quot; Hurd stated in response to the  lender's announcement. &quot;However, Wells still needs to compensate  the families and communities its predatory lending has hurt.   These business practice changes must also be made permanent and  enforceable by Court order.  Otherwise, Wells could revert to its  old ways of doing business.&quot;</p>
<p>   ACORN's report on the lending by Wells Fargo Bank and Wells  Fargo Home Mortgage is the first public analysis of a specific  lender's performance in individual states and metropolitan areas  using the new 2004 Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) data.  For  the first time lenders had to report the  Annual Percentage Rates  (APRs) charged on their high rate mortgages.  For last year on  average, first mortgages with Annual Percentage Rates (APRs)  above 8 percent and second mortgages with APRs above 10 percent  were considered high rate.</p>
