<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON, May 27  -- The world's richest nations greatly exaggerate their aid to poor countries -- with the U.S., the worst offender, giving only 0.02 percent of its income in real assistance, says a study released today by ActionAid International.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">   The report, which can be downloaded at <a href="http://www.actionaidusa.org/Action%20Aid%20Real%20Aid.pdf" target="_new">http://www.actionaidusa.org/Action Aid Real Aid.pdf</a>, says that some two-thirds of the money donated by the world's wealthiest countries is in actuality &quot;phantom aid&quot; that is not genuinely available for poverty reduction in developing countries.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">   Phantom Aid is aid that is diverted from poor nations for other purposes within bureaucratic aid systems.  This includes aid that is, among all G7 donations:</font></p>
<ul>
 <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">not targeted for poverty reduction, estimated to be worth US$4.9 billion</font></li>
 <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">double counted as debt relief, totaling US$9.4 billion</font></li>
 <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">overpriced and ineffective- Technical Assistance, estimated at US$13.8 billion</font></li>
 <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">tied to goods and services from the donor country, estimated at US$2.7 billion</font></li>
 <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">poorly coordinated and with high transaction costs, estimated at US$9 billion</font></li>
 <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">too unpredictable to be useful to the recipient – lack of data prevents an estimate</font></li>
 <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">spent on immigration-related costs in the donor country; totaling US$1.5 billion</font></li>
 <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">spent on excess administration costs; totaling US$0.4 billion. </font></li>
</ul>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">   In total, says the study, at least 61 percent of all donor assistance from G7 nations is phantom aid, with real aid in 2003 accounting for just US$27 billion, or only 0.1 percent of combined donor income.  Nearly 90 percent of all contributions coming from the United States and France are considered phantom aid.</font></p><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">   Says ActionAid International USA Policy Analyst, Rick Rowden, &quot;what this comes down to is that the US government is spending the tax dollars of well-meaning Americans on bloated, inefficient, and manipulative programs that do little to help the poor.  This is inexcusable when you consider that a child dies every two seconds from hunger somewhere in the world.&quot;</font></p><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">   The report argues that the share of real aid is unlikely to increase unless a system of genuine accountability, which balances the interests of donors, recipients, and the poor, can be put in place.</font></p><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">   In addition, the report calls for a new International Aid Agreement that will hold donor countries accountable.  This Agreement should include clear policies from developing countries on the criteria for accepting aid; mutual commitments from donor and recipient countries; national and international review forums; and new mechanisms for increasing the amount and predictability of aid to the world’s poorest countries.</font></p><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">   Every day, 800 million people go to bed hungry, 30,000 children die of preventable disease, 100 million children are denied education.  Three children a minute die due to unsafe water and sanitation.  Approximately 30 children die a minute of hunger.</font></p><p align="CENTER"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">###</font><!-- #EndEditable -->
