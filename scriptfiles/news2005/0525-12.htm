<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ARLINGTON, VA -- May 25 -- Today, the Senate confirmed by a vote of 56-43 an extreme anti-women's rights, anti-civil rights nominee to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals.  </font><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Priscilla Owen has voted against a woman's right to choose in every abortion-related opinion. Owen is often referred to as an Enron or Halliburton appointee who, as a justice on the Texas Supreme Court, consistently ruled for business and against consumers and women's rights, and tried to weaken discrimination protections in employment.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Owen vote showed that Democrats had enough votes to filibuster her.  But under a deal struck by 14 Senators to defeat, for now, the so-called &quot;nuclear option&quot; to eliminate the use of filibusters against judicial<br>nominees, Owen was given a pass.    </font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Although the deal leaves open the possibility that the filibuster could be used in &quot;extraordinary circumstances,&quot; will saving women's lives, women's rights, and civil rights ever be considered such an extraordinary circumstance?  If the record of Priscilla Owen and two other anti-women's rights, anti-civil rights nominees who will not be filibustered under the deal are to be the standard, then these rights are in grave peril.  <br></font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
