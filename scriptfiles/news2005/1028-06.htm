<p>Democratic Republic of Congo / PARIS - Greenpeace welcomed a decree (1) by 
President Kabila of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) to reform the 
Congolese logging sector this week.

<p>New logging concessions will be frozen in up to 40 million hectares of 
rainforest while the legality of all current logging concessions are 
examined by an inter-ministerial commission, assisted by a team of 
independent, international experts. If the review is conducted properly, 
Greenpeace expects that many of the 20 million hectares already slated 
for logging in DRC will be returned to the state.

<p>The Congo rainforest is the second largest in the world after the 
Amazon. It is home to more plant and animal life than any other forest 
in Africa, including rare species such as the Okapi and the Congo 
Peacock that are found nowhere else in the world. It is also a refuge 
for three of the four Great Apes - chimpanzees, bonobos and gorillas.

<p>"This welcome move will give the Congo rainforest breathing space while 
corrupt and illegal logging companies are weeded out. Widespread illegal 
and badly managed logging not only decimates the rainforest but causes 
social conflicts. It also pushes chimpanzees and gorillas towards 
extinction and exacerbates the illegal trade in bushmeat," said 
Greenpeace International forest campaigner, Filip Verbelen. 

<p>Greenpeace has been investigating logging in the Congo and discovered 
that it does not contribute to sustainable development and prosperity, 
as the logging industry claims, but creates poverty, social conflict and 
wreaks environmental havoc.

<p>"Until now, the logging industry has been a law unto itself, destroying 
the rainforest to supply wood to Europe, Asia and the USA. This decree 
is an important first step towards responsible and socially just forest 
management, but this will only be achieved in this post-conflict country 
with assistance from the international community," said Verbelen.

<p>Greenpeace is an independent campaigning organization, which uses 
non-violent, creative communication tools to put the spotlight on global 
environmental problems and to drive towards solutions essential for a 
green and peaceful future.

<b></b><b><p>Notes to Editors:</b>
<p>(1) President Kabila has confirmed the moratorium on the allocation of 
new logging concessions will be maintained until a process to review the 
legality of all existing logging concessions is finalised and until new 
rules for allocation of concessions have been defined. A copy of the 
decree is available on request (only in French).
