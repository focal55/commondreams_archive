<p>WASHINGTON - In a strong show of opposition to advertising for prescription 
drugs, 211 professors from U.S. medical schools endorsed a statement that 
&#8220;direct-to-consumer marketing of prescription drugs should be prohibited.&#8221; 
&nbsp;<BR><BR>The statement&#8217;s <A 
href="http://www.commercialalert.org/dtcstatement.pdf">endorsers</A> include 
prominent medical school professors from Harvard, Johns Hopkins, University of 
Pennsylvania, Columbia, Stanford, Yale, Duke, University of California, San 
Francisco and other top medical schools, along with two former editors-in-chief 
of the <I>New England Journal of Medicine</I>.&nbsp; Commercial Alert wrote and 
organized the statement, and released it today. <BR><BR>Next week, Commercial 
Alert will present the statement to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 
testimony at the FDA&#8217;s hearings on direct-to-consumer drug advertising.&nbsp; 
The statement follows.<BR><B><BR><I>Statement on Direct-to-Consumer Marketing of 
Prescription Drugs</I></B><BR>&nbsp;<BR>Direct-to-consumer marketing of 
prescription drugs should be prohibited.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>In 2004, pharmaceutical 
companies spent more than $4 billion in an onslaught of advertising to promote 
prescription drugs.&nbsp; This advertising does not promote public health.&nbsp; 
It increases the cost of drugs and the number of unnecessary prescriptions, 
which is expensive to taxpayers, and can be harmful or deadly to 
patients.<BR><BR>For more than half a century, certain drugs have been available 
to patients only with a prescription, because all drugs, including those that 
can heal, can also cause harm.&nbsp; Doctors, nurses and other health 
professionals have the necessary training and experience to help them decide 
whether drugs are indicated in particular cases.&nbsp; This is why they make the 
prescription decision, not patients. <BR>&nbsp;<BR>Prescription drug advertising 
pressures health professionals to prescribe particular medications, and often 
the ones that may be less effective and more expensive and dangerous.&nbsp; This 
intrudes in the relationship between medical professionals and patients, and 
disrupts the therapeutic process. It takes up valuable time to explain to 
patients why they may have been misled by the drug advertisements they have 
seen.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>Prescription drug advertising is not educational.&nbsp; It is 
inherently misleading because it features emotive imagery and omits crucial 
information about drugs and their proper use, as well as about side effects and 
contraindications that can be found on the full FDA-approved label. Drug 
companies have an inherent and irredeemable financial conflict-of-interest which 
drives them to exaggerate the positive and minimize the negative qualities of 
their own products. <BR>&nbsp;<BR>At a minimum, direct-to-consumer prescription 
drug advertising should not exist unless accompanied by the full FDA-approved 
label.&nbsp; Nor should drug ads be allowed to display imagery that is primarily 
emotive and not educational.&nbsp; Drug ads on TV and radio should be prohibited 
because they cannot meet this standard for truthfulness.</p>
