<p>BANGKOK - December 1 - Industrialised countries must stop 
exporting climate change to developing countries if social, economic and 
environmental disaster is to be averted, according to a new Greenpeace 
report on the power sector in Asia and its impacts on the climate.  The 
report is published today to mark the arrival of its flagship the 
Rainbow Warrior in Bangkok on the final leg of its Asia Energy 
Revolution Tour. (1)
 
<p>"Countries in Asia are being hooked on fossil fuels such as coal by the 
very same governments who have agreed to lower greenhouse emissions in 
their own countries," said Greenpeace Southeast Asia Climate Campaigner 
Tara Buakamsri.
 
<p>Burning our Future finds that industrialised nations, while themselves 
being large emitters of greenhouse gasses, are guilty on two counts of 
sponsoring climate change in developing countries through the export of 
fossil fuels like coal to the region, and through the funding of dirty 
technology by international financial institutions like the Asian 
Development Bank. (2)

<p>Maliwan Nakwiroj, a member of the Mae Moh community in northern 
Thailand, who has lived by the Mae Moh coal plant, described to the 
press conference how the plant had adversely affected his community:  
"Many have died because of this plant and many of us continue to  suffer 
from respiratory illnesses.  Our communities are polluted and our crop 
is dying.  All due to the plant and it's dirty emissions.  Soon, we, the 
people of Thailand, will suffer greater hardships due to the climate 
change caused by this coal plant and others like it."
 
<p>In order to get the energy revolution on its way, Greenpeace is calling 
on all governments currently present in Montreal at the first meeting of 
the parties to the Kyoto Protocol to start negotiating the deep emission 
cuts needed to avoid dangerous climate change. (3)
 
<p>"Climate change is a reality but so too are the solutions," said 
Buakamsri.  "Government and industry need to drastically change their 
mindset  - a new coal plant built now will end up being vastly more 
expensive than wind turbines or biomass in 5-7 years time. (4) 
Preventing climate change not only makes common sense but economic sense 
too."
 
<p>The Rainbow Warrior has been leading the Asia Energy Revolution Tour in 
Australia, Hong Kong and the Philippines, exposing the impacts of 
climate change and promoting the uptake of renewable energy such as wind 
and solar power and is currently in Bangkok on the Thailand leg of its 
Asia Energy Revolution Tour.

<p>Burning our Future can be downloaded at <a href="www.asiacleanenergy.org">www.asiacleanenergy.org</a><p> Greenpeace is an independent campaigning organisation that uses 
non-violent creative confrontation to expose global environmental 
problems to force solutions that are essential to a green and peaceful 
future.
<p>*****
<p>Notes:

<p>(1) The impacts of climate change in Asia include: high altitude glacial 
retreat; sea-level rise and flooding in low-lying areas especially 
coastal mega cities; an increase in flooding from heavier rains; severe 
droughts in arid areas; an increase in cyclone intensity; threats to 
agriculture and aqua-culture; freshwater at risk; and the spread of 
diseases such as malaria and dengue fever.  Every year for the past 20 
years, an average of over 400 million people has been exposed to floods 
in Asia.  Between 1987 and 1997, 44% of all flood disasters worldwide 
affected Asia, claiming 228,000 lives (93% of all flood-related deaths 
worldwide).  Economic losses in that decade totalled US $136 billion.

<p>(2) Burning Our Future, p 5

<p>(3) In order to keep global temperature increase below 2°C and prevent 
dangerous climate change, industrialised nations must achieve an 80% 
reduction of their greenhouse gases' emissions by 2050, while globally 
there must be a 50% cut.

<p>(4) Renewable energies are independent from world market fossil prices 
and therefore predictable for the coming years. Wind farm operators, for 
example, are able to provide a price guarantee for 15 to 20 years. The 
price for "coal-electricity" is dependent on the price of coal - which 
has been steadily rising over the past few years and is not expected to 
come down. 

<p>Even though coal power plants are cheaper now, the wind industry expects 
to be competitive within the next 5 to 7 years. By the time a new coal 
power plant is connected to the grid, it is believed that wind power 
plants will be cheaper.
