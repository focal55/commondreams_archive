<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->ISTANBUL, Turkey  - September 5 - A Turkish court today rejected an 
application for the removal of the bail conditions placed on 21 
Greenpeace activists who peacefully protested at the state-owned Can 
coal power plant against the Government's dangerous energy policy on 
August 29th.
 
<p>The ruling particularly affects five foreign activists who are not 
allowed to return to their home countries for an indefinite time. 
Although no charges have yet been brought, this decision impacts on both 
their professional and personal lives.

<p>"The activists took non-violent action to expose a major cause of 
climate change that threatens to affect us all. The response from the 
Turkish authorities has been to restrict their freedom of movement 
before a charge has even been brought. The decision by the court to keep 
these restrictions in place is a significant blow to Turkey's claim to 
be a progressive and fair society," said Paul Horsman of Greenpeace 
International.

<p>As a result of the ruling, international pressure is expected to focus 
on Turkish embassies and the Turkish Government itself, making the case 
that these restrictions are wholly unnecessary and are undermining the 
reputation of Turkey as an open and progressive part of the 
international community.

<p>Letters from Greenpeace offices worldwide have already been sent to 
their respective Turkish embassies demanding the immediate removal of 
these bail conditions, with supporters from across the Greenpeace world 
also expected to voice their protest.

<p>Greenpeace lawyers submitted the application yesterday arguing that:
- The bail conditions have no precedent in cases of environmental protest
- The conditions severely affect the lives of those in question
- In view of the fact that no volunteer involved in a Greenpeace action 
has ever failed to attend a court date, there is no evidence to indicate 
that such restrictions are necessary
- The conditions are disproportionate compared to the actions of those 
arrested

<p>Greenpeace is an independent, campaigning organisation, which uses 
non-violent, creative confrontation to expose global environmental 
problems, and to force solutions essential to a green and peaceful future.
