<p>NEW YORK – On October 19, 2005, Amnesty
International launches a year-long panel series in New
York City to bring greater attention to war crimes
against women.  From 7:00 to 9:00pm in Jerome Hall at
Columbia Law School, panelists Christine Hansen, Kelly
Askin, Bill Berkeley, and Sonia Navani will discuss
the ongoing brutalization and murder of women in areas
of conflict and the legal and practical challenges in
bringing criminals to justice and treating survivors. 
Today casualties among women and children outnumber
casualties among combatants.

<p>The series is one part of Amnesty’s campaign to raise
public awareness and mount public action to bring to
justice perpetrators of war crimes against women.  “We
must act before violence against women becomes a
standard munition in the modern arsenal.  We’re
already witnessing that happen,” said Denise Bell, an
Amnesty activist working on the issue.  “Look at the
ongoing atrocities in Darfur and the Democratic
Republic of Congo.  Amnesty is acting to press
governments to hold perpetrators accountable, and the
series is one way of galvanizing public awareness.”
