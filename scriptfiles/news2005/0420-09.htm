<p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- April 20 -- </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The following is a statement of Democracy 21 President Fred Wertheimer on Pence-Wynn Charade 'Reform' Legislation:</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The House Administration Committee is holding hearings today on campaign finance proposals.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Legislation introduced by Reps. Christopher Shays (R-Conn.) and Marty Meehan (D-Mass.), entitled the &quot;527 Reform Act of 2005,&quot; would close the huge soft money loophole for 527 groups that resulted in hundreds of millions of dollars in unregulated, unlimited contributions being spent to influence the 2004 federal elections.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Legislation introduced by Reps. Mike Pence (R-Ind.) and Albert Wynn (D-Md.), entitled the &quot;527 Fairness Act of 2005,&quot; is a charade and a farce.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Pence-Wynn bill contains no provisions dealing with 527 groups.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Instead, the legislation repeals the aggregate limit on the total contributions an individual can make to political parties and to federal candidates in a two-year election cycle and would take us back to a corrupt system of financing federal elections.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The aggregate contribution limits that the bill would repeal were enacted in 1974, in response to the Watergate scandals.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Under current law, for example, an individual can give a total of $61,400 to all political party committees in a two-year election cycle. Under the Pence-Wynn bill, an individual would be able to give a total of more than $1 million to the committees of a single political party in a two-year election cycle. And, a President, Senator or Representative, or a federal candidate would be able to solicit this amount -- more than a million dollars -- for their party from a single donor. Currently federal candidates and officeholders can solicit an individual donor for no more than $61,400 in contributions to a party in a two-year cycle.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Under current law, an individual can contribute a total of $40,000 to all federal candidates in a two-year cycle.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Under the Pence-Wynn bill, an individual could contribute a total of $2 million or more to all federal candidates in a two- year cycle. The limit per federal candidate is $4,200 for a primary and general election.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">And, a President, Senator or Representative, or a federal candidate, would be able to solicit this amount -- $2 million or more -- from a single donor. Currently federal candidates and officeholders can solicit an individual donor for no more than $40,000 in contributions to federal candidates in a two-year cycle.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Pence-Wynn bill represents an extraordinary step backwards to a corrupt system where federal officeholders could once again solicit huge sums of money for federal elections from wealthy individuals and Washington lobbyists seeking to influence government decisions.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The naming of the Pence-Wynn bill as the &quot;527 Fairness Act of 2005&quot; mocks all citizens who care about protecting the integrity of our political system and preventing the use of huge sums of money to corrupt our democracy. </font></p><p align="CENTER">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
