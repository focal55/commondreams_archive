<p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- April 1 -- Media Advisory</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WHAT: Late on Thursday night, 31 March 2005, the United Nations Security Council voted to refer the situation in Darfur, Sudan to the International Criminal Court (ICC). According to the UN, tens of thousands of people have died in the region and close to two million people have been forced from their homes in just the past two years. The Security Council vote counted 11 countries in favor of the referral and 4 countries &#150; Algeria, Brazil, China and the Unites States &#150; abstaining.  This Security Council vote marks the first time the Security Council has referred a case to the ICC whose treaty, the Rome Statute, came into force on 1 July 2002. </font></p><p align="LEFT"> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">HOW: On 18 September 2004, the UN Security Council adopted Resolution 1564 which included provisions to create an independent International Commission of Inquiry &#147;to investigate reports of violations of international humanitarian law and human rights law in Darfur by all parties&#133;and to identify the perpetrators of such violations with a view to ensuring that those responsible are held accountable&#148;.  In their report released on 25 January 2005, the Commission wrote that it &#147;strongly recommends that the Security Council immediately refer the situation of Darfur to the International Criminal Court, pursuant to article 13(b) of the ICC Statute&#148;.  Following more than two months of debate, the Council voted today on the referral.</font></p><p align="LEFT"> </p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A referral by the UN Security Council under its Chapter VII authority is one of the three ways that a case can be brought to the ICC. In addition to a Security Council referral, situations can be referred by States that are party to the ICC treaty and the ICC Prosecutor can also initiate investigations using his proprio motu powers &#147;on the basis of information on crimes within the jurisdiction of the Court&#148;.    </font></p><p align="LEFT"> </p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WHO: Of the 15 countries currently on the UN Security Council, nine members &#150; Argentina, Benin, Brazil, Denmark, France, Greece, Romania, Tanzania and the United Kingdom &#150; are party to the ICC treaty and three &#150;  Philippines, Russia and the United States &#150; are signatories to the treaty. Three others &#150;Algeria, China and Japan &#150; have neither signed nor ratified the treaty.</font></p><p align="LEFT"> </p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">COMMENT AND BACKGROUND: Experts from human rights organizations are available for background information and comment and can be reached through the list on the following page. </font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Important notice:  </i></font></p><p align="LEFT"><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CICC's policy on the referral and prosecution of situations before the ICC:  The Coalition, an independent NGO movement, is dedicated to the establishment of the International Criminal Court as a fair, effective, and independent international organization. The Coalition will continue to provide the most up-to- date information about the ICC and to help coordinate global action to effectively implement the Rome Statute of the ICC. The Coalition will also endeavor to respond to basic queries and to raise awareness about the ICC's trigger mechanisms and procedures, as they develop. The Coalition as a whole, and its secretariat, do not endorse or promote specific investigations or prosecutions or take a position on situations before the ICC. However, individual CICC members may endorse referrals, provide legal and other support on investigations, or develop partnerships with local and other organizations in the course of their efforts.</font></i></p><p align="LEFT"></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
