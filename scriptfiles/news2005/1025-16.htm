<p>NEW YORK - The Bush administration is now 
the only government in the world to claim a legal justification for 
mistreating prisoners during interrogations, Human Rights Watch 
said today.

<p>The administration recently approached members of the U.S. 
Congress to seek a waiver that would allow the CIA to use cruel, 
inhumane, or degrading treatment on detainees in U.S. custody 
outside the United States.   
  
<p>While many other governments practice torture and other forms of 
mistreatment and have records of abuse far worse than the United 
States, no other government currently claims that such abuse is 
legally permissible, Human Rights Watch said.   
  
<p>"The administration is setting a dangerous example for the world 
when it claims that spy agencies are above the law," said Tom 
Malinowski, Washington director of Human Rights Watch. 
"Congress should reject this proposal outright. Otherwise, the 
United States will have no standing to demand humane treatment if 
an American falls into the hands of foreign intelligence services."   
  
<p>Earlier this month, in a 90-9 vote, the U.S. Senate approved a 
measure sponsored by Republican Sens. John McCain and Lindsey 
Graham that would prohibit the military and CIA from using 
"cruel, inhumane, or degrading treatment" in the case of any 
detainee, anywhere in the world.   
  
<p>But last week, Vice President Dick Cheney and CIA director 
Porter Goss met with Sen. McCain to propose a presidential waiver 
for the proposed legislation. The proposed waiver states that the 
measure "shall not apply with respect to clandestine 
counterterrorism operations conducted abroad, with respect to 
terrorists who are not citizens of the United States, that are carried 
out by an element of the United States government other than the 
Department of Defense."   
  
<p>The waiver, which by its own terms applies to non-military 
counterterrorism operations against non-citizens overseas, states 
that such operations need to be "consistent with the Constitution 
and laws of the United States and treaties to which the United 
States is a party, if the president determines that such operations 
are vital to the protection of the United States or its citizens from 
terrorist attack." But the Constitution does not robustly curtail the 
conduct of the CIA overseas, and relevant domestic laws contain 
numerous jurisdictional loopholes. Moreover, administration 
officials have previously told Congress that they do not consider 
CIA personnel operating outside the United States to be bound by 
legal prohibitions against "cruel, inhumane, or degrading 
treatment" under treaties to which the United States is party.   
  
<p>"This exception contains code language that could give the CIA a 
green light to treat prisoners inhumanely," said Malinowski. "If 
allowed to stand, it will render President Bush's past pledges about 
humane treatment meaningless."   
  
<p>Human Rights Watch said the waiver would also open the door for 
outright torture, as interrogators would find it impossible to draw 
lines between illegal and "allowable" mistreatment. Bush 
administration officials, under questioning from members of 
Congress in the past, have failed to clearly define differences 
between torture and lesser forms of mistreatment. They have also 
made inaccurate statements about the definition of torture; for 
instance, administration officials have claimed that 
"waterboarding" (suffocating a person until he believes he is about 
to drown) is not a form of torture.
