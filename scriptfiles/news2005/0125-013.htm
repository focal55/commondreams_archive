<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- January 25 -- With Illinois acting last week to ban anti-gay discrimination, 47 % of the U.S. population  138 million people now lives in a jurisdiction that bans discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, according to an analysis by the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force Policy Institute. Ten years ago, the figure was 34%.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The analysis also found that more than one in four Americans - 27%  now lives in a jurisdiction that bans discrimination against transgender persons, up from 4% ten years ago, and 5% just five years ago. Illinois's law also bans discrimination based on gender identity and expression.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Thanks to the hard work of grassroots activists, the glass of basic fairness for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender Americans is slowly filling up,&quot; said Sean Cahill, Director of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force Policy Institute. &quot;While we have a long way to go until all of us are protected from discrimination in employment, housing, and public accommodations, the progress is undeniable and unstoppable.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Policy Institute analysis concluded that the actions of state legislatures and town councils reflected strong public support for laws protecting gay and transgender people from discrimination.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As nondiscrimination protections have spread across the nation at the local and state level, a federal bill to ban anti-gay discrimination in employment has languished in Congress for nearly a decade.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Some Facts:</font></p><ul><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">With Illinois adopting a law banning discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, nearly 138 million Americans now live in a state or local jurisdiction with such a law.</font></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Another 79 million live in a place that bans discrimination against transgender people. Ten years ago, only 9.7 million Americans lived in a jurisdiction that banned such discrimination.</font></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> However, 156 million Americans, or 53% of the U.S. population, live in a state or jurisdiction where one can be fired, refused service in a restaurant, or denied housing or a loan simply because of his/her actual or perceived sexual orientation.</font></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 215 million Americans, or 73% of the U.S. population, live in a jurisdiction where a person can be fired, refused service in a restaurant, or denied housing or a loan simply because of his/her actual or perceived gender identity or expression.</font></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Fifteen states (including Illinois) ban discrimination based on sexual orientation.

The first state to ban anti-transgender discrimination was Minnesota in 1993.</font></li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Washington, DC and more than 200 towns, cities and counties also ban sexual orientation discrimination, and more than 70 local jurisdictions ban anti-transgender discrimination.</font></li></ul><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Full text of the report is available at: <a href="http://www.thetaskforce.org/downloads/glasshalffull.pdf" target="_new">http://www.thetaskforce.org/downloads/glasshalffull.pdf</a></font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For a United States map showing the state nondiscrimination laws, visit: <a href="http://www.thetaskforce.org/downloads/nondiscriminationmap.pdf" target="_new">http://www.thetaskforce.org/downloads/nondiscriminationmap.pdf</a></font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Founded in 1973, the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force was the first national lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) civil rights and advocacy organization and remains the movement's leading voice for freedom, justice, and equality. We work to build the grassroots political strength of our community by training state and local activists and leaders and organizing broad-based campaigns to defeat anti-LGBT referenda and advance pro-LGBT legislation. Our Policy Institute, the community's premiere think tank, provides research and policy analysis to support the struggle for complete equality. As part of a broader social justice movement, we work to create a world that respects and makes visible the diversity of human expression and identity where all people may fully participate in society. Headquartered in Washington, DC, we also have offices in New York City, Los Angeles, and Cambridge. </i></font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
