<p>WASHINGTON - October 21 - The National Coalition to Abolish the Death Penalty

will hold its annual conference at the Hyatt on Town Lake in Austin,

Texas Oct. 27-30. This is the first time NCADP has convened in Austin

and its first trip to Texas since 1997, when it met in Houston.

 

<p>"NCADP 2005: Turning Wins into Winning" comes at a time when death

sentences are down nationwide, at least a half dozen states are debating

abolition, moratorium and other reform legislation and U.S. Catholic

leaders have announced a broad campaign against use of the death

penalty. In Texas, however, problems remain with the way the death

penalty system is carried out.

 

<p>“Texas continues to operate a system that fundamentally lacks fairness,”

said Diann Rust-Tierney, NCADP executive director. “Four times in the

last two years, the U.S. Supreme Court has overturned Texas death sentences.

Texas continues to seek the execution of people with severe mental retardation, 

mental illness and people who may well be factually innocent. NCADP looks

forward to highlighting the many problems in Texas and discussing solutions.”

 

<p>NCADP’s conference will follow in the footsteps of the "Journey of Hope...

From Violence to Healing," which was launched in Huntsville Oct. 15

and is traveling to more than a dozen towns and cities across the state

before concluding in Austin. The Journey of Hope features the personal

stories of family members of murder victims who oppose the death penalty

as well as relatives of people on death row and people who have been executed.

 

<p>NCADP’s conference will feature veteran organizers within the abolition movement,

leading lawyers who work on death penalty cases, religious leaders who oppose

the death penalty, family members who have lost loved ones to murder yet oppose

the death penalty, relatives of death row inmates and people who have been freed

from death row due to innocence. The local host for the NCADP conference is 

NCADP’s Texas affiliate, the Texas Coalition to Abolish the Death Penalty.

 

<p>Conference highlights include:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Families of executed death row inmates will gather for the first time as

part of a project entitled “No Silence, No Shame: families of the executed

speak out against the death penalty.” A public launch of this event and

media availability will be held at 4 p.m. Thursday, Oct. 27.<br>
</li>
<li>Religious leaders will discuss the death penalty at an opening plenary

session at 9:30 a.m. Friday, Oct. 28. Speakers include Richard Daly of

the Texas Catholic Conference, Suzii Paynter of the Texas Baptist Christian

Life Commission, Rabbi Kerry Baker of Congregation Kol Halev and Joseph

Parker, pastor of David Chapel Missionary Baptist Church.<br>
</li>
<li>State legislators will discuss the opportunities and challenges they face

in their efforts to reform death penalty laws or repeal the death penalty

altogether. Legislators include state Sen. Rodney Ellis of Texas; Assemblyman

Joseph Lentol of New York, Rep. Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona and former state 

Rep. Renny Cushing of New Hampshire. Gary Bledsoe, President of the Texas NAACP,

will moderate the panel, which will take place at 10:30 a.m. Friday, Oct. 28.<br>
</li>
<li>Family members of murder victims who oppose the death penalty as well as

death row exonorees will share their experiences at a panel scheduled for 9 a.m.

Saturday, Oct. 29.<br>
</li>
<li>A first-of-its-kind film festival will feature portions from seven just-released

or soon-to-be-released documentaries at 8 p.m. Friday, Oct. 27. Documentaries

to be aired include Deadline, The Empty Chair, A Question of Justice, Race to Execution,

The Trials of Daryl Hunt, Thou Shall Not Kill and After Innocence.<br>
</li>
<li>The 6th Annual March to Stop Executions will take place at 3 p.m. Saturday, Oct. 29.

The march will begin at Austin’s City Hall, Cesar Chavez and Lavaca, and will proceed
