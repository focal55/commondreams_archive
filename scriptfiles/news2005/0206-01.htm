<p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- February 6 -- Thousands of U.S. taxpayers opposed to the war in Iraq are expected to use a new &quot;Peace Tax Return&quot; as a means to protest-or even resist-the spending of their federal tax dollars for the war.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The &quot;Peace Tax Return 2004,&quot; produced by the National War Tax Resistance Coordinating Committee (NWTRCC), has two options, either of which would be sent to the IRS or an elected official. The first option (Part A) is for people who will be paying their taxes but want to make a protest. For those who willing to go further, the second option (Part B) is for taxpayers who will be refusing to pay some or all of their federal income taxes, despite possible consequences from the IRS.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A third part of the peace tax form, which is to be returned (anonymously if desired) to NWTRCC, will allow the organization to track its use, thus measuring the extent of the protest.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Peace Tax Return is modeled on a return produced by Conscience, The Peace Tax Campaign in Britain, one of many groups around the world who are lobbying for legislation that would allow conscientious objectors to war to pay their taxes into a special fund that would not be used by the military.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Copies of the Peace Tax Return can be obtained by downloading from the web (<a href="http://www.nwtrcc.org/peacetaxreturn.htm" target="_new">http://www.nwtrcc.org/peacetaxreturn.htm</a>) or by sending a self-addressed stamped envelope to NWTRCC, PO Box 150553, Brooklyn, NY 11215.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>The National War Tax Resistance Coordinating Committee is a 22-year-old coalition of groups who provide information about war tax resistance and support for those who refuse to pay some or all of federal income and excise taxes because they help pay for war.</i></font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
