<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->SANTA MONICA, California  - September 7 - The  Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights (FTCR) today exposed  internal oil company memos that show how the industry  intentionally reduced domestic refining capacity to drive up  profits.  The exposure comes in the wake of Hurricane Katrina as  the oil industry blames environmental regulation for limiting  number of U.S. refineries.
<p>   The three internal memos from Mobil, Chevron, and Texaco   (available at <a href="http://releases.usnewswire.com/redir.asp?ReleaseID=52755&Link=http://www.consumerwatchdog.org/energy/fs/">http://www.consumerwatchdog.org/energy/fs/</a> show  different ways the oil giants closed down refining capacity and  drove independent refiners out of business. The confidential  memos demonstrate a nationwide effort by American Petroleum  Institute, the lobbying and research arm of the oil industry, to  encourage the major refiners to close their refineries in the  mid-1990s in order to raise the price at the pump.</p>

<p>   &quot;Large oil companies have for a decade artificially shorted  the gasoline market to drive up prices,&quot; said FTCR president  Jamie Court, who successfully fought to keep Shell Oil from  needlessly closing its Bakersfield, California refinery this  year. &quot;Oil companies know they can make more money by making less  gasoline.  Katrina should be a wakeup call to America that the  refiners profit widely when they keep the system running on  empty.&quot;</p>
<p>   &quot;It's now obvious to most Americans that we have a refinery  shortage,&quot; said petroleum consultant Tim Hamilton, who authored a  recent report about oil company price gouging for FTCR.  (Read  the report at <a href="http://releases.usnewswire.com/redir.asp?ReleaseID=52755&Link=http://www.consumerwatchdog.org/energy/rp/">http://www.consumerwatchdog.org/energy/rp/</a>   )  &quot;To  point to the environmental laws as the cause simply misses the  fact that it was the major oil companies, not the environmental  groups, that used  the regulatory process to create artificial  shortages and limit competition.&quot;</p>
<p>   The memos from Mobil, Chevron and Texaco show the following.</p>

<p>   -- An internal 1996 memorandum from Mobil demonstrates the oil  company's successful strategies to keep smaller refiner Powerine  from reopening its California refinery. The document makes it  clear that much of the hardships created by California's  regulations governing refineries came at the urging of the major  oil companies and not the environmental organizations blamed by  the industry. The other alternative plan discussed in the event  Powerine did open the refinery was &quot;....buying all their avails  and marketing it ourselves&quot; to insure the lower price fuel didn't  get into the market.

<p>   -- An internal Chevron memo states; &quot;A senior energy analyst  at the recent API convention warned that if the US petroleum  industry doesn't reduce its refining capacity it will never see  any substantial increase in refinery margins.&quot; It then discussed  how major refiners were closing down their refineries. Read the  Chevron memo at  <a href="http://releases.usnewswire.com/redir.asp?ReleaseID=52755&Link=http://www.consumerwatchdog.org/energy/fs/5103.pdf">http://www.consumerwatchdog.org/energy/fs/5103.pdf</a> </p>
<p>   -- The Texaco memo disclosed how the industry believed in the  mid-1990s that &quot;the most critical factor facing the refining  industry on the West Coast is the surplus of refining capacity,  and the surplus gasoline production capacity. (The same situation  exists for the entire U.S. refining industry.) Supply  significantly exceeds demand year-round. This results in very  poor refinery margins and very poor refinery financial results.  Significant events need to occur to assist in reducing supplies  and/or increasing the demand for gasoline. One example of a  significant event would be the elimination of mandates for  oxygenate addition to gasoline. Given a choice, oxygenate usage  would go down, and gasoline supplies would go down accordingly.  (Much effort is being exerted to see this happen in the Pacific  Northwest.)&quot; As a result of such pressure, Washington State  eliminated the ethanol mandate - requiring greater quantities of  refined supply to fill the gasoline volume occupied by ethanol.
