<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON -  July 8 -  It's been described as the biggest under-reported issue in America. The issue is population growth -- and according to the United Nations, by 2050 the world will add another 2.6 billion people, a number equal to the entire world population in the 1950s.</font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Throughout World Population Day, John Seager, President of Population Connection, will be available for interviews and to provide analysis.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Population Connection (formerly Zero Population Growth) is the largest grassroots group in the country mobilizing Americans to meet the global population challenge. For nearly forty years, the organization has been educating young people and advocating for progressive action to stabilize world population at a level that can be sustained by the earth's resources.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For almost a decade John Seager has been leading Population Connection's effort to mobilize Americans to meet the global population challenge -- and was recently appointed the organization's president and CEO. A veteran of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and Capitol Hill -- where he was Chief of Staff to former seven-term U.S. Rep. Peter H. Kostmayer (PA-8) -- Seager is currently writing a book on the implications of declining fertility rates and current population trends. </font></p><p align="CENTER"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">###</font></p><!-- #EndEditable -->
