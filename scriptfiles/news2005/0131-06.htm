Through its national Network of food banks and food-rescue organizations, America's Second Harvest has served more than 16 billion meals to more than 250 million Americans since its inception.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;As we reflect on 25 years of progress and contemplate the challenges ahead, America's Second Harvest continues to raise awareness of domestic hunger and advance our mission of creating a hunger-free America,&quot; said Robert Forney, president and chief executive officer of America's Second Harvest. &quot;We are profoundly appreciative of our financial and product donors, volunteers and the nearly 6,000 Network employees who work each day to eradicate hunger in this country.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To mark this milestone, America's Second Harvest recently conducted a national opinion poll on hunger awareness in the United States. The poll revealed that 90 percent of voters believe that improving nutrition programs for low-income families will help children learn in school. Additionally, 80 percent of voters would like to see the United States government do more to end hunger.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">President George W. Bush launched the 25th Year Commemoration by issuing a Presidential Proclamation recognizing America's Second Harvest for 25 years of fighting hunger and poverty. Further plans include the America's Second Harvest &quot;25/25&quot; Campaign consisting of 25 community events on 25 different days in 2005. New facility dedications, regional potlucks, Kids Cafe openings, and food and fund drives are a sampling of planned events in urban, suburban and rural areas.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In its first year of operation, America's Second Harvest distributed 2.5 million pounds of food to 13 food banks. Today, the Network secures and distributes nearly two billion pounds of food and grocery products that reach 23 million Americans annually. After a quarter-century, the America's Second Harvest Network consists of more than 200 food banks and food-rescue organizations in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico, serving hungry Americans in nearly every county of the United States.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>As of January 2005, America's Second Harvest adopted an expanded name to include &quot;The Nation's Food Bank Network&quot; to describe its growing Network capacity, strengthen the Network membership, and increase funds, food and awareness.</i></font></p><p><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For more information on the 25th Year Commemoration and the &quot;25/25&quot; Campaign, visit <a href="http://www.secondharvest.org/" target="_new">http://www.secondharvest.org</a>.</font></i></p><p><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">America's Second Harvest - The Nation's Food Bank Network is the nation's largest domestic hunger-relief organization with a Network of more than 200 regional Member food banks and food- rescue programs serving all 50 states and Puerto Rico.
