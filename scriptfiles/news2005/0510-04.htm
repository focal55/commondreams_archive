The Candlelight Vigil honors those men and women who have lost their lives in the line of duty protecting their communities as law enforcement professionals. The Brady Center, Law Enforcement Relations is proud to announce its support for this event and we encourage our nation to recognize the sacrifices of these brave men and women and their families.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to the 2004 &quot;Fallen Heroes Report&quot; released jointly by the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund (NLEOMF) and Concerns of Police Survivors (COPS), 58 police officers were shot and killed in the line of duty, second only to vehicle accidents in leading causes of death of on-duty law enforcement officers.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Brady Center and its sister organization the Brady Campaign has enjoyed a long-standing relationship with America's law enforcement community. &quot;I cannot tell you how proud we are of the men and women in law enforcement,&quot; said James Brady, former Press Secretary to President Ronald Reagan, who was shot and permanently disabled in an assassination attempt in 1981. &quot;Our thoughts and prayers go out to the families and surviving officers who lost loved ones and colleagues. I think every patriotic American should take time this week to remember the daily sacrifices these brave men and women make so we can live in freedom.&quot;</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Police week is a special time for the law enforcement community, starting with the Candlelight Vigil in remembrance of those officers who have lost their lives,&quot; said John Shanks, Law Enforcement Relations Director for the Brady Center, &quot;but the rest of week is a celebration of those lives and the profession.&quot; The Brady Center is committed to working closely with law enforcement to reduce the number of deaths in our country.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To learn more about National Police Week call the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial at 202-737-3400 or visit their Web site at <a href="http://www.nleomf.org/" target="_new">http://www.nleomf.org</a>.
