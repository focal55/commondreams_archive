<p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- April 15 --  News Advisory: </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">World Bank/IMF Spring Meetings April 15-17, 2005: ActionAid International representatives from the US, UK and Malawi in DC are available for interview or comment on crucial issues in the fight against world poverty.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Operating in some 50 countries, and directly assisting 14 million individuals a year, ActionAid International is a nonprofit dedicated to combating global poverty and the conditions that cause it.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ActionAid International says:</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">1. The presidential selection process and other aspects of World Bank and IMF governance must be reformed</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;ActionAid is deeply troubled by the undemocratic process by which the United States secured the World Bank presidency for Paul Wolfowitz,&quot; said ActionAid International USA executive director Atila Roque. &quot;The US, UK and other major World Bank shareholders have been sharply critical of the lack of transparency and accountability in many developing countries. In this context, this secretive leadership selection process by which the US just gets to insert its nominee is breathtakingly hypocritical.&quot;</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">2. Parliamentarians from poor countries are telling the IFIs to become more democratic</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The IMF and World Bank have made repeated claims that the economic policy reforms attached as conditions on their loans are not imposed from the outside, but instead are 'country-owned',&quot; said Rick Rowden, policy analyst with ActionAid International USA. &quot;In fact, economic policies which harm poor people continue to be imposed by the IFIs as conditions on debt relief and new loans, with these institutions retaining the power to overrule local parliaments.&quot;</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">3. Selling IMF gold could cancel poor countries' debts and benefit poor people</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Romilly Greenhill, policy officer with ActionAid International UK said: &quot;The IMF is sitting on 3000 tons of gold. Selling just a tenth of it could save half a million lives by, for example, funding healthcare for expectant mothers. It would not disrupt the market -- that's the IMF's own opinion -- so the obstacles now are plainly political. It's down to whether the G7 have hearts of stone or hearts of gold.&quot;</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i><b>Notes to editors</b></i></font></p><p align="LEFT"><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Rick Rowden +1 202 247 1558 and Romilly Greenhill +44 7812 605131 are in DC and can comment on all these issues.</font></i></p><p align="LEFT"><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">McBride Nkhalamba of ActionAid Malawi has traveled to the Spring Meetings with the Malawian parliamentarians Louis Ted Kalebe and Austin Mtukula to deliver the International Parliamentarians Petition for Democratic Oversight of the IMF and World Bank.</font></i></p><p align="LEFT"><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On April 15th at 1 pm, parliamentarians from five continents will gather at the World Bank to deliver the petition, signed by some 1000 legislators from 50 parliaments around the world.
