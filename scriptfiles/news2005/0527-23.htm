<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">MADISON, Wisconsin - May 27 - The Wisconsin Green Party announced today that it will work with citizens 
across the state to place an advisory referendum on as many local ballots as 
possible in next spring's election asking voters the question, "Should the 
United States begin an immediate, phased withdrawal of its troops from 
Iraq?"

</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Jeff Peterson, of Luck, will coordinate the various efforts around the 
state, most of which will involve convincing county boards to give their 
constituents the opportunity to weigh in on the war. "We intentionally 
crafted a referendum that is neutral in its language," said Peterson. "We're 
not trying to put local elected officials on the spot by forcing them to 
take a stand on the war. We just think that, after two years, it would be 
the democratic thing to do to allow average citizens to weigh in on the Iraq 
situation."

</font><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Peterson, who was the Green Party's candidate for lieutenant governor in 
2004, said he expects the idea of a voter referendum to receive an 
enthusiastic response not only from local Green Party chapters, but also 
from the informal network of peace and justice groups that have sprung up 
around the state in recent years. They will also reach out, he said, to 
families with loved ones in the military.

</font><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Wisconsin law permits statewide referenda of an advisory nature, but only 
with the legislature's approval. Because that can be difficult, many 
referenda questions are submitted at the county level. In last April's 
election, for example, the Wisconsin Counties Association succeeded in 
getting two questions regarding state funding of court and social service 
systems on the ballot in almost every county. Both questions passed 
overwhelmingly.

</font><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Cities and villages may also vote to put referenda on their ballots; they 
are obliged to do so when presented with petitions containing signatures 
totalling 15% of the vote for governor in the last election.

</font><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Wisconsin Green Party Co-Chair Jill Bussiere of Kewaunee thinks people are 
ready to have a say on the war. "We've had countless vigils and marches and 
protests," she said, "but too often they go unreported by the media. I think 
if the majority of those voting next April 4 vote in favor of withdrawing 
our troops from Iraq, that will send a strong message to our national 
elected representatives in Washington."

</font><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">While their proposed referendum may be worded in neutral language, the Green 
Party is anything but neutral on issues of war and peace. One of what they 
call their "key values" is nonviolence, and Greens were among the earliest 
and most outspoken critics of the Bush administration's decision to invade 
Iraq. And while theirs may have been the minority view two years ago, 
Bussiere says she thinks people are growing weary of a war that appears as 
if it has no end.

</font><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"There are still some people who think that, to support the troops, you have 
to support the war, too," she said. "I think the best way to show support 
for our troops is to make every effort to bring them home as soon as 
possible.&quot;</font></p><p align="CENTER"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">###</font><!-- #EndEditable -->
