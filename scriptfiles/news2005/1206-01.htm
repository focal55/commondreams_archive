<p>WASHINGTON - December 6 - Award-winning filmmaker and journalist Danny Schechter exposes the failures of Iraq news reportage in a new book that goes beyond the conventional right-left framework.  <i>When News Lies: Media Complicity and the Iraq War</i> reveals how the media marketed the war to the American public.

 

<p>“Many newspapers and media companies have issued “mea-culpas’ admitting flawed coverage in the run-up to the war,” says Schechter.  “But what about the ongoing distorted and sanitized coverage of the war itself?”

 

<p>The book will be launched at “A Night of Truth and Media” December 13 by MediaChannel.org the world's largest online media issues network.  The dean of the White House press corps, UPI’s Helen Thomas, will be present to receive Media Channel’s 2005 “Journalism of Truth and Courage” Award. 

 

<p>Col. Sam Gardiner (USAF, retired), an information warfare specialist, writes in the preface: “Danny Schecter’s book is not a history book.  Its importance is not in our understanding the past.  More than anything, he is warning us to be prepared for the future.” Vanity Fair columnist Michael Wolff, who covered the 2003 invasion of Iraq, wrote the book’s foreword.

 

<p>Select Books, Inc. is releasing When News Lies in a special Digital Media Edition, with a DVD of Schechter’s award-winning documentary Weapons of Mass Deception, a critique of television coverage of the U.S. invasion.  His “manifesto” on the media, The Death of Media, will also be launched by Melville House at the event.
