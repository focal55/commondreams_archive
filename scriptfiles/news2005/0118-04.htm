<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- January 18 -- A lawsuit was filed late Friday January 14th in the U.S. District Court in Reno, Nevada against President Bush and Vice President Cheney. The lawsuit alleges that both defendants have acted outside the scope of their job description in waging a war against Iraq.  The complaint alleges that both defendants and others working within the White House and Defense Department have covertly implemented  a white paper called &#147;Rebuilding America&#146;s Defenses&#148; as presented  by the Project for the New American Century or PNAC in September, 2000 two months before the murky  elections of that year. Among the persons signing the paper were Richard Cheney and Jeb Bush. While the paper was published on the internet, implementation of it by the White House has been in secret.</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The thrust of the white paper calls for the complete domination of the globe by the US with wars against Iraq, Syria, and Iran, domination of outer space and of Cyberspace. It calls for an enlarged military to fight simultaneous wars. Security bases world wide with extensive constabulary forces posted to keep all nations subservient to US military and economic power.  It also calls for nuclear rockets to be fired from Spy satellites to suppress any challenge to US global domination.</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The class action lawsuit filed by retired attorney and great-grandfather, Doug Wallace alleges that the defendants have violated their oaths of office in entering into a private treaty relating to International relations without approval of the Congress and have made a mockery of the Constitution under a false banner of a war on terrorism.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The lawsuit seeks an injunction against further implementation of the PNAC plan without a 2/3 vote of the congress and a full disclosure to the American Public. It also names John Does 1-100 as defendants.  The suit seeks restitution to the US Treasury from all Defendants of the cost of the war with Iraq and also seeks a ruling that since the deception about the war and execution of it was outside of their job descriptions they should all be individually liable to private persons injured as a result of their illegal conduct.
