<p>Every Day Is Mother’s Day (Excerpt)
David Rovics

<p>There's a camp in Crawford, women in grief
<br>
No way for them to find any relief<br>
Their sons are dead and they've come to see
<br>
The man who made their destiny
<br>
He's squirming there on his vacation<br>
Trying to look like he's leading the nation<br>
But folks are vying for that position
<br>
They've got guts and they've got a mission
<br>
You can open your ears and hear everybody say
<br>
That every day is mother's day

<p>David Rovics Bio

<p>David Rovics has been called the musical voice of the progressive movement in the US. Amy Goodman has called him "the musical version of Democracy Now!" Since the mid-90's Rovics has spent most of his time on the road, playing hundreds of shows every year throughout North America, Europe, Latin America and the Middle East. He and his songs have been featured on national radio programs in the US, Canada, Britain, Ireland, Italy, Sweden, Denmark and elsewhere. He has shared the stage regularly with leading intellectuals (Noam Chomsky, Howard Zinn), activists (Medea Benjamin, Ralph Nader), politicians (Dennis Kucinich, George Galloway), musicians (Billy Bragg, the Indigo Girls), and celebrities (Martin Sheen, Susan Sarandon). He has performed at dozens of massive rallies throughout North America and Europe and at thousands of conferences, college campuses and folk clubs throughout the world. He makes all of his recordings available for free download on his website, www.davidrovics.com, and the downloads are in the many hundreds of thousands. More importantly, he's really good. He will make you laugh, he will make you cry, and he will make the revolution irresistable. http://members.aol.com/drovics/bio.htm
