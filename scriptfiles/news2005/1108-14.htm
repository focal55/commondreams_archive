<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->NEW YORK - November 8 - A bipartisan group of 68 members of the U.S. House 
of Representatives sent a letter to the Indonesian President last week 
urging action on the case of a murdered human rights lawyer, Munir Said 
Thalib.  Munir was fatally poisoned on a flight to Amsterdam on September 
7, 2004.  After a Dutch autopsy revealed a massive dose of arsenic in his 
system, President Yudhoyono appointed an official fact-finding team to look 
into the death.

<p>The team's report was completed in June 2005 but was never 
released.  According to media reports, it implicated senior officials at 
both the state airline and the State Intelligence Agency.  But when the 
trial of a copilot charged with poisoning the activist began in August, the 
prosecution failed to mention the report or its findings, sparking fears 
that whoever ordered the killing would never be identified.

<p>Almost 70 members of Congress joined in calling for justice for Munir 
because this case is so important to the future of human rights in 
Indonesia," said Neil Hicks, Director of International Programs at Human 
Rights First.  "Munir's family and friends, and all Indonesians, deserve to 
know the truth about who killed this courageous activist."

<p>The bipartisan letter, which was co-sponsored by Representatives Mark Kirk 
(R-IL) and Jim McDermott (D-WA), closes by noting "Munir devoted his life 
to finding the truth, and in the end he gave his life for that cause.   Now 
his own death is the subject of an unprecedented fact-finding report.  We 
strongly urge your government to fulfill Indonesia's promise as an open and 
democratic society by publicly releasing the report and acting on its 
recommendations." (<a href="http://www.humanrightsfirst.info/pdf/05118-hrd-indonesia-sby-ltr.pdf">Full text of the letter.</a>)
<p>According to members of the fact-finding team, these recommendations 
include the creation of a commission with a robust mandate and the full 
backing of the president to continue the investigation into Munir's 
death.  The team, which was headed by a police general and included leading 
human rights figures and a top prosecutor, also reportedly recommended an 
audit of the police investigation to determine why it has not been able to 
identify Munir's killers.

<p>Presidential Decree No. 111 of 2004, which established the fact-finding 
team, states that "It is the government that will subsequently announce the 
results of the team's investigation to the public."

<p>Munir's case has increasingly become the subject of international 
concern.  In June, his wife, Suciwati, was accompanied by Human Rights 
First in meetings with State Department officials in Washington, D.C.  In 
September, Human Rights First released a <a href="http://www.humanrightsfirst.org/defenders/hrd_indonesia/letters/munir-white-paper-090605.pdf%20">White Paper</a> on the case.<!-- #EndEditable -->
