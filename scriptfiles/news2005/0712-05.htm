<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -  July 12 - In a letter sent today, 25 member groups of the Sustainable Energy Coalition submitted a series of detailed recommendations to the Members of the U.S. Senate selected to serve on the House-Senate Conference on the Energy Policy Act of 2005.  (The letter will be forwarded to the House conferees as soon as their names are officially announced.)</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The signers to the letter urged the conferees to &quot;set the country on a path to substantially reduce the level of energy imports, reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, and begin the transition towards a sustainable energy economy by dramatically increasing the use of domestically available renewable energy resources and, energy efficient technologies.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The groups specifically expressed support for ten key sustainable energy provisions found in the Senate version of the energy bill.  These include a long-term, broadly-based production tax credit, a Renewable Portfolio Standard, an environmentally-sound Renewable Fuels Standard, energy efficiency standards for appliances, a national oil savings goal, long-term energy efficiency and renewable energy tax credits, and robust authorization levels for federal sustainable energy R&amp;D programs.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In addition, the groups proposed five additional measures, not found in either the House or the Senate bills, that should be incorporated into the final energy bill.  These include improved fuel efficiency standards for cars and light trucks, provisions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and national standards for interconnection and net metering for distributed renewable energy technologies.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Noting that &quot;Congress now has an opportunity to put this country on the path to a clean energy future that can create jobs, save consumers money and reduce the threat of climate change,&quot; the groups urged that &quot;the final bill provide sufficient incentives, authorizations and policies to move our country towards a sustainable energy future.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The full text of the letter and list of signers are provided in full below.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>The Sustainable Energy Coalition is a coalition of nearly 100 national and state business, consumer, environmental, and energy policy organizations which collectively represent several thousand companies and community-based organizations.  Founded in 1992, the Sustainable Energy Coalition works to promote increased use of renewable energy and energy efficient technologies.</i></font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">===============================</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SUSTAINABLE ENERGY COALITION<br>1612 &quot;K&quot; Street, N.W.; #202-A<br>Washington, D.C. 20006<br>202-293-2898, x.201</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Recommendations for the House-Senate Conference on the Energy Policy Act of 2005</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">July 12, 2005</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Senate Conferees Energy Policy Act of 2005<br>United States Senate<br>Washington, DC 20510</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Attn:  Energy Policy Staff</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dear Senator:</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As you prepare for the House-Senate Conference on the Energy Policy Act of 2005, we urge you to ensure that the final bill provides sufficient incentives, authorizations and policies to move our country towards a sustainable energy future.  To achieve this goal, we believe that the conference report should set the country on a path to substantially reduce the level of energy imports, reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, and begin the transition towards a sustainable energy economy by dramatically increasing the use of domestically available renewable energy resources and, energy efficient technologies.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To realize these goals, the conference report should incorporate the following, which were included in the Senate legislation:</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">1.)	A long-term production tax credit, that benefits the cross-section of commercially available and emerging renewable energy technologies;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">2.)     	A national Renewable Portfolio Standard, at least as robust as that included in the Senate legislation;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">3.)	Long-term tax credits for energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies that reduce emissions and encourage the use of new energy sources;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">4.)	Permanent or long term, unrestricted reauthorization of Energy Savings Performance Contracting (ESPCs), which allow private financing of energy-efficiency improvements to federal buildings;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">5.)            A Renewable Fuels Standard at least at the level provided by the Senate, if it is accompanied by language to prevent any environmental backsliding;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">6.)            The provisions in the Senate's Renewable Fuels Standard that support the production of ethanol from cellulosic materials;&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">7.)	Additional new energy efficiency standards for appliances and equipment,</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">8.)	A requirement for states to consider Energy Efficiency Resource Standards and a pilot program to begin implementation of those standards;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">9.)	A significant oil savings goal, buttressed by adding enforcement language to the current Senate provision;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">10.)	Robust authorizations for research, development, demonstrations and purchase requirements for hydrogen and fuel cell technologies.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Additionally, the conference report should include provisions, missing in both the House and Senate versions of the bill, which are vital towards moving us towards a sustainable energy future:</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">1.)	Modest improvements in standards for corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) that would require fuel efficiency standards for automobiles and light duty trucks to meet a 40 mile per gallon (mpg) level by 2020 and other accommodations for national oil savings</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">2.)	National standards for net metering and interconnection to facilitate the development of distributed renewable energy technologies and enhanced transmission and distribution grid reliability.  These standards must include fee schedules that accommodate very small distributed generation equipment</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">3.)	Authorization levels for federal renewable energy and energy efficiency program budgets that are at least twice as high as current levels;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">4.)	Provisions to reduce the levels of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, including, but not limited to, a cap-and-trade system.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">5.)	Additional investment tax credits for renewable and efficiency technologies such as small distributed wind turbines.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Congress now has an opportunity to put this country on the path to a clean energy future that can create jobs, save consumers money and reduce the threat of climate change.  We look forward to working with you to create an energy policy for the 21st century that provides for energy security and sustainability while reducing our dependence on finite energy resources.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Thank you for your thoughtful consideration.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sincerely,</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Alliance for Affordable Energy<br>American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy<br>American Solar Energy Society<br>American Wind Energy Association<br>Bob Lawrence &amp; Associates<br>Breakthrough Technologies Institute<br>Business Council for Sustainable Energy<br>Cascade Associates<br>Clean Fuels Development Coalition<br>Colorado Energy Group<br>Environmental and Energy Study Institute<br>Geothermal Resources Council<br>National Environmental Trust<br>Natural Resources Defense Council<br>NewBio E Systems Inc.<br>New Community Project<br>New Uses Council<br>Northwest SEED<br>Redwood Alliance<br>Solar Energy Industries Association<br>The Stella Group, Ltd.<br>Sterling Planet, Inc.<br>SustainableBusiness.com<br>Union of Concerned Scientists<br>U.S. Public Interest Research Group</font></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p align="CENTER"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">###</font></p><!-- #EndEditable -->
