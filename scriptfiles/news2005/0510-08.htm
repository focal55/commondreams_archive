<p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- May 10 -- The Court's ruling dismissed Sierra Club's effort to shine a spotlight on the dirty, secret backroom dealing between the administration and Enron, Exxon and others energy CEOs.  Now, the American people will never learn how the polluting energy policy that President Bush continues to push was crafted.  One thing is clear, this polluting energy policy overwhelmingly benefits the energy industry which met behind those closed doors, while leaving the American public with higher energy prices, dirty air and global warming pollution, and despoiled special places.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Had the Bush administration not shut out the public along with consumer and environmental groups, perhaps we would have seen some of the common sense technological solutions like increased efficiency, renewable energy like wind and solar power, and better automotive fuel economy become the centerpiece of an energy policy every American could get behind.  Instead, the House of Representatives just passed an energy bill that vainly attempts to drill and dig our way to energy independence and ignores solutions.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Here the Bush administration has succeeded in locking the public out and letting industry and corporate special interests call the shots.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">background information on the case can be found at: <a href="http://www.sierraclub.org/environmentallaw/lawsuits/viewCase.asp?id=173" target="_new">http://www.sierraclub.org/environmentallaw/lawsuits/viewCase.asp?id=173</a></font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
