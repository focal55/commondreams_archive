The latest decisions taken by the Chilean judicial system in the fight against impunity must be an example for others to follow. Until other countries take concrete action against human rights violations, impunity in Latin-America will continue to prevail.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Background information<br>Augusto Pinochet will be the first former head of state to be brought to justice on charges of human rights violations committed in the context of the &quot;Condor Operation&quot; -- a well elaborated strategy agreed between the military governments ruling in Chile, Argentina, Paraguay, Uruguay, Brazil and Bolivia, during the 1970&#146;s and 80&#146;s, with the aim of combining forces to persecute, arrest and torture political opponents, many of whom continue to be &quot;disappeared&quot;.</i></font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
