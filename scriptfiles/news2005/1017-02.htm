HONG KONG &#8211; China is in a position to become the world 
leader in wind power, according to a Greenpeace report released today. Wind 
Guandong, a study of wind power potential in the heavily industrialized Guandong 
province in southern China, says that by 2020 alone, the region could feasibly 
produce enough energy from wind turbines to meet the equivalent of Hong Kong&#8217;s 
total current electricity supply.
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>&#8220;This report confirms that with political and industry will Guangdong&#8217;s 
uptake of clean wind power could become a model for renewable energy development 
not only in China but for all of Asia,&#8221; said Robin Oakley, Greenpeace China&#8217;s 
Energy spokesperson. &#8220;This would be a gigantic step forward in reducing the 
threat of climate change and powering the sustainable growth of the region&#8217;s 
economies.&#8221;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>By 2020 enough wind power could feasibly be installed 
in Guangdong to cut carbon emissions by 29 million tonnes. Guangdong, the 
richest and most populous province in China, is among the biggest emitters of 
carbon dioxide (CO2) in China and Chinese scientists claim that the 
concentrations of carbon dioxide in the region are among the highest in the 
world. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&#8220;Every player in China is actively devoted to wind energy,&#8221; said Li 
Junfeng, Director of the Chinese Renewable Energy Industry Association, 
&#8220;including the Big Five Power Companies, some private companies and some 
provincial energy investment companies. Even companies like China Guangdong 
Nuclear Power, which has been investing in nuclear power, is paying attention to 
wind power.&#8221;</DIV>

<DIV>The Greenpeace flagship Rainbow Warrior is currently in Hong Kong leading 
the Asian Energy Revolution Tour of Hong Kong, The Philippines and Thailand. The 
ship will spend the next two days in the South China Sea measuring and recording 
wind in the region. To observe its findings live, log on to:<BR><A
