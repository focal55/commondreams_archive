<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->BRUSSELS - August 17 - Genetically engineered seeds, such 
as the GE rapeseed developed by the U.S. biotech company Monsanto, are 
likely to be given the green light to be imported into Europe. The 
European Commission is planning to publish its decision on the 
controversial seeds into the European Union for use in food and animal 
feed today, despite 13 of the 25 EU member states voting against the 
proposal (1).

<p>“The Commission will be blatantly disregarding the wishes of the 
majority of its member states and pushing this controversial decision 
through at a time when representatives are on holiday,” said Greenpeace 
International Campaigner Christoph Then. “Allowing the import of 
Monsanto’s GE rapeseed into Europe poses substantial risks to the 
environment and maybe even to human health.”

<p>GE seeds pose several risks to the environment, specifically the 
uncontrolled dispersal of the seeds contaminating non-GE crops. The GE 
rapeseed is to be imported as whole kernels and then milled, a hugely 
risky process, as the seed cannot be completely contained during the 
process and transportation.

<p>Once dispersed, the GE rapeseed can grow, pollinate and then spread 
rapidly across Europe. Pollen from rapeseed is reported to travel for 
several kilometres. The first cross-contamination of wild rapeseed and 
its GE counterpart was reported in the UK recently. In addition to this, 
documentation from authorities investigating GE imports into Japan 
showed importing rapeseed for processing can cause massive dissemination 
of GE rapeseed around the harbours and the mills. Of the ten harbours 
investigated, eight were contaminated. A number of transport routes as 
far as 30 kilometres from the port were also affected.

<p>There is growing concern amongst experts that GE rapeseed should never 
be cultivated in Europe precisely because its pollination and 
dissemination cannot be controlled. Even Bayer, another biotech company, 
withdrew its EU application to grow GE rapeseed after EU member states 
raised their concerns.

<p>Another concern is the significant health effects that have been 
observed in animal feed trials. Recent studies by Monsanto on rats 
showed potentially adverse effects, especially significant differences 
in liver weight. However, the company has withheld the original data of 
these studies from the public (2).

<p>The risks of uncontrolled spillage and unanticipated adverse effects of 
the GE rapeseed were even acknowledged by the EU Commission in its 
decision to allow the imports. The Commission demands that additional 
measurements must be made against spillage and reporting systems for any 
observed effects. However, Greenpeace believes these measurements are 
clearly insufficient.

<p>“While it is encouraging that the EU Commission acknowledges the fact 
that this crop can hardly be prevented from escaping into the 
environment it should be using that very evidence to reject market 
approval of GE seeds completely. The alternative of putting effective 
controls and monitoring systems in place on voluntary agreements is 
simply unworkable,” said Then. “The decision should be revoked 
immediately, and the standards of EU risk assessment and procedure of EU 
authorisation be reorganised completely.”

<p>Greenpeace is an independent, campaigning organisation, which uses 
non-violent, creative confrontation to expose global environmental 
problems, and to force the solutions, which are essential to a green and 
peaceful future.
<p>&nbsp;*Notes to editors*

<p>(1) In the EU Council of Environment Ministers on December 2004, only 
six member states voted in favour of the GE rapeseed (GT73), but 13 
voted against and the rest of 25 abstained.

<p>(2) Greenpeace wrote several letters to national authorities to get hold 
of the data. After the organisation won a court case allowing it access 
to Monsanto’s confidential data of feeding trials with GE maize in June 
2005, it was also expected that the data on the feeding trials with GT73 
would be made public; but so far the documents have not been published. 
Contrary to EU law German officials explicitly refuse access to the 
data, and Greenpeace is awaiting a reaction from the Government in The 
Netherlands, where Monsanto originally filed the data.

<p>This is the fourth time the EU Commission has allowed the import of GE 
crops after a five years moratorium that ended in 2003. The other crops 
are herbicide resistant maize (NK603) and sweet maize containing 
insecticidal toxin (Bt11) and maize meant for animal feed (MON863).
