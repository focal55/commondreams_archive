<p>WASHINGTON - October 12 - A message from Judy Shepard, mother of Matthew Shepard — who died seven years ago today following a brutal hate crime — <a href="http://www.hrc.org/weekly_address/weekly_address.htm" target="_new">is available online</a>.

<p>“No mother should have to see her child’s life cut short because of hate,” says Shepard in the video message. “My son Matthew was murdered in an anti-gay hate crime seven years ago this month. Since then, too many other innocent Americans have been attacked or killed because they were gay or transgender. But Congress still hasn’t acted. Every American child deserves the strongest protections from some of this country’s most heinous crimes.”

<p>“Judy carries Matthew’s torch and inspires millions with her story,” said Joe Solmonese, president of the Human Rights Campaign. “Everybody should take action today by asking their senators to pass hate crimes laws that protect the GLBT community from hate violence, as the House did just last month.”

<p>Shepard is executive director of the Matthew Shepard Foundation and an HRC board member.

<p>The Human Rights Campaign is the largest national lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender political organization with members throughout the country. It effectively lobbies Congress, provides campaign support and educates the public to ensure that LGBT Americans can be open, honest and safe at home, at work and in the community.
