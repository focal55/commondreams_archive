<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CHICAGO -- March 11 --  What is the chief honcho for the National Rifle Association and key Bush supporter doing with a French name? With a name like Wayne LaPierre, you'd think good 'ol Wayne would be buttering croissants with John Kerry instead of working to make it easy for terrorists to buy big guns.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Oh, and we mean big guns. Like the .50 Caliber Sniper Rifle that a terrorist can use to shoot down a plane landing or taking off. Because of LaPierre's brass knuckle threats to Congress, he got them and the Justice Department to make it as easy for a terrorist to buy a .50 cal as it is to buy a rifle.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Because of the NRA, the Government Accounting Office said &quot;47 known or suspected terrorists were allowed to buy firearms in the United States from February through October last year, including some who were under active surveillance.&quot; That's the way Wayne wants it.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In fact, the Violence Policy Center reported in October of 2001 that terrorists purchased .50 Caliber Sniper Rifles in a study, &quot;Voting From the Rooftops: How the Gun Industry Armed Osama bin Laden, Other Foreign and Domestic Terrorists, and Common Criminals with 50 Caliber Sniper Rifles.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If your jaw just dropped and you break out in a cold sweat when your next plane takes off, maybe you'll be wondering if the NRA is getting a little extra &quot;dues&quot; from Al-Qaeda. Because otherwise, how could anyone advocate a policy that makes us more vulnerable to terrorism?</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Of course, the Bush Administration gives the NRA whatever it wants, even if it means putting a .50 caliber sniper rifle right in the hands of a terrorist.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Remember, it's your life that's at stake -- and Wayne LaPierre couldn't give a damn, nor could the Bush Administration.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Wayne LaPierre is our hypocrite of the week because he's always babbling on about &quot;self-protection&quot; and when given the opportunity to protect Americans from suspected terrorists with .50 caliber rifles, he just looks the other way.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Hey Wayne, we want to keep our nation safe from terrorists, not arm them.</font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
