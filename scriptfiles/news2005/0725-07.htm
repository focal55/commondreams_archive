Each screening will be followed by a discussion with director Deborah Koons Garcia and various speakers on the dangers posed by genetic engineering. The Bar Harbor event will feature a GE-Free Benefit Dinner at Havana's and post screening reception at Rupununi's. For locations and guest speakers at the various events see end of this release. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Future of Food offers an in-depth investigation into the disturbing truth behind the unlabeled, patented, genetically engineered foods that have quietly filled U.S. grocery store shelves for the past decade. The health implications, government policies and push towards globalization are all part of the reason why many people are alarmed by the introduction of genetically altered crops into our food supply. A spotlight was shown on this issue this Spring when Brooklin town residents, inspired and aided by GE Free Maine, passed the first town meeting resolution in Maine against the growth of these crops in their communities. This event has inspired other towns to work on this issue in their own towns. Garcia and other experts on the threats posed by genetic engineering will be available following the showing to answer questions and lead a discussion.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to a Film review in the March 2005 issue of Nature Biotechnology Magazine, &quot;The Future of Food provides an excellent overview of the key questions raised by consumers as they become aware of GM foods... [The film] draws questions to critical attention about food production that need more public debate.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Deborah Koons Garcia, widow of Jerry Garcia, received a Master of Fine Arts from the San Francisco Art Institute. Her educational series All About Babies, narrated by Jane Alexander, won a Cine Golden Eagle and a Gold Medal from the John Muir Medical Film Festival, among other awards.

She was the instigator and chief creative consultant for Grateful Dawg, a documentary about the musical friendship between her husband Jerry Garcia and David Grisman. Grateful Dawg premiered at the Telluride Film Festival and went on to a lively run on the festival circuit, in theaters, and on television.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">GE Free Maine is a statewide coalition built around the belief that GE free agriculture sustains us all while genetic engineering only sustains corporate control of the seeds of life and puts at risk the family farms that support Maine's economy.
