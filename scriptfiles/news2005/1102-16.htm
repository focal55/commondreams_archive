<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->ATLANTA - November 2 - Getting children back to school as quickly as possible is vital to ensuring their well-being after a catastrophe such as the deadly earthquake in South Asia or the devastation wreaked on Central America by Hurricane Stan.</p>

<p>Recent experience responding to humanitarian emergencies shows that the "safe space" schools provide is a key element to disaster recovery, both for children and for parents and guardians who are often overwhelmed with daily survival tasks. Education must be made a priority in the response, along with elements such as shelter, food, water, sanitation and health care, says Hassan Mohamed, CARE Technical Advisor for Education in Emergencies.</p>

<p>"School can play a critical role by offering structure, stability and hope for the future during a time of crisis, particularly for children and adolescents," says Mohamed. "Survivors also need the tools education can provide as they work to recover and build future economic stability."</p>

<p>CARE staff in disaster-affected communities in Pakistan, India, Guatemala and Honduras are surveying the needs for international humanitarian support for the education sector. Among the key considerations for a sound educational response to disaster:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Psychosocial Services:</strong> In emergencies, unhealthy and traumatic stress can lead to distress in children. Interventions to help support children can include games, sports, oral history projects, arts and performance, and gardening and nature activities.</li>

<li><strong>Provision of Supplies:</strong> Replacement material for educational resources such as books, furniture and student records destroyed or looted in the disaster.</li>

<li><strong>Training:</strong> Preparation for professional teachers and community volunteers to meet new needs posed by disaster, which often means expanding teaching skills beyond traditional methods.</li>

<li><strong>School Nutrition:</strong> If properly administered, school meals or food supplements for families can increase school attendance, and may improve children's nutritional status and academic performance.</li>
</ul>

<p>Rehabilitation/Reconstruction of Educational Facilities: Where conventional school buildings are not available, securing "safe spaces" for children is vital. Communities should be actively involved in reconstructing schools and take on long-term responsibility for their upkeep. Where possible schools should be built with a view to prevent or minimize damage from future disasters.</p>

<p>CARE works on emergency response, education, and other humanitarian issues in 70 countries worldwide.</p>
