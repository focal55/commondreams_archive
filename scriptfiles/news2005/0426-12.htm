<p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- April 26 -- In a move to thwart debate and limit press interest, the Majority on the Ways and Committee has called a rare Monday late-night session to mark-up the Kucinich Resolution of Inquiry on Social Security. The mark-up, which Members were not notified of until Friday afternoon, has been scheduled for tonight at 8:00pm.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Kucinich resolution, offered on March 17th, demands all supporting documents from the White House for the President's speech in Portsmouth, New Hampshire on February 16, 2005. While in Portsmouth, President Bush stated, &quot;And by the way, there is no Social Security trust.&quot;  </font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The President repeated his statement on April 5, 2005, at a speech at West Virginia University at Parkersburg, in Parkersburg West Virginia. </font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;It is clear that the Majority, in effort to avoid real debate and stymie press interest, is continuing their pattern of conducting important business under the cover of darkness,&quot; stated Kucinich. &quot;There can be no other reason for holding such an important hearing at such an odd hour. The Majority owes the American public a real, honest and fair debate on this issue.&quot;</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The Administration's instance that there is no Social Security Trust Fund represents a breach of the public's confidence of the highest magnitude,&quot; continued Kucinich. &quot;I hope that the Majority will consider rescheduling this mark-up and allow all Members, the public, and the press a fair opportunity to debate this important resolution.&quot; </font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A Resolution of Inquiry is a House procedure that requires action by the Committee within 14 legislative days. Kucinich's resolution is co-sponsored by 36 Members of Congress. </font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
