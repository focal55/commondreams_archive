<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- March 10 -- Today, EPA officials announced the implementation of the Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR), which was created in order to limit and control sulphur dioxide (SOX) and nitrogen oxides (NOX).  In response to today's announcement by the EPA, the Sierra Club issued the following<br>statement:</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Yesterday, the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee blocked efforts by the Bush administration and Senator James Inhofe to replace the current Clean Air Act with something more favorable to big energy companies.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Today's announcement by the EPA, and yesterday's failure of the reckless air proposal in the Senate, should send a clear message that we need to enforce - not weaken - the Clean Air Act.  It is fine to move forward with the interstate transport rule as long as it does not eliminate the other important provisions of the Clean Air Act that act as a safety net.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The best way to achieve the clean air that Americans deserve continues to be strong enforcement of the Clean Air Act.  Thirty years of clean air progress shows that enforcing the Clean Air Act protects public health.  It makes no sense to turn our back on success.&quot;</font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
