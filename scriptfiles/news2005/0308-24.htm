Activists with the coalition will announce their plans to challenge the City's refusal to allow<br>them to march.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We have already won an important victory in obtaining the right to rally in Central Park, a right that was denied by Mayor Bloomberg last year during the Republican National Convention,&quot; said Larry Holmes, an organizer with the Troops Out Now Coalition.  &quot;Now the City is trying to keep us from marching.  We cannot and will not allow an unreasonable and arbitrary edict to rob us of our basic First Amendment rights.&quot;</font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
