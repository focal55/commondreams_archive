<p>NEW YORK - November 21 - The humanitarian aid organization Action Against Hunger (ACF) held its annual World Food Day Gala in New York City—this year on November 11th—and raised more than $500,000 for its life-saving international programs.
<p>The evening was held at the Metropolitan Club of New York City and featured the participation of a number of luminaries, including ACF's National Staff Member of the Year, Aimé Lukelo, and producer/director Terry George (recently, of Hotel Rwanda fame) who presented the “Action Against Hunger Humanitarian Award” to the event's honoree, Archbishop Desmond Tutu. The Archbishop's warm participation and stirring speech were highlights of the evening.

<p>In addition to the exquisite menu served up by some of New York’s finest chefs and world music diva Angélique Kidjo's moving performances, Action Against Hunger launched its new “Wishing Well” auction. It brought in $185,000 through a flurry of enthusiastic bidding, securing funds for:

<p>
<ul>
<li>43 fishing and farming equipment kits (at $1,000 each)</li>
<li>19 drinking wells (at $2,500 each)</li>
<li>5 radios (at $5,000 each), and</li>
<li>medicines for 7 feeding centers (at $10,000 each)</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to the "Wishing Well," ACF's much-anticipated live auction raised another $66,000, ensuring that overall, the event netted more than $500,000 for ACF’s life-saving programs.
<p>Action Against Hunger would like to thank its benefit committee members, Gala Chairs and co-chairs, attendees and honorees, participating chefs and celebrities, and all of those whose invaluable support was central to the success of the evening—a success that will help us restore self-sufficiency and dignity to hungry children and their families the world over.

<p><b>About ACF's Humanitarian Award
</b>
<p>Action Against Hunger presents its World Food Day Humanitarian Award each year to someone who has made a significant contribution to the struggle to end world hunger. ACF announced that it would present Nobel Prize winner Archbishop Desmond Tutu with its annual World Food Day Humanitarian Award in recognition of his outstanding work against hunger, malnutrition and poverty worldwide.

<p>"Throughout his career, Archbishop Desmond Tutu has worked not only for political equality, but also for the fulfillment of basic human needs such as clean water, adequate food, and health care," said Cathy Skoula, Executive Director of Action Against Hunger. "We are proud to present our award to this esteemed advocate for humanity who will in turn honor us with his presence at our Gala."
Past recipients of the award include former South African President Nelson Mandela, Professor Michael Golden and Dr. Yvonne Grellety for their roles in inventing the therapeutic milk formula F100 (a revolutionary life-saving formula to cure malnutrition, now the standard for relief organizations worldwide), Pulitzer Prize-winning author Frank McCourt, and actor Jeff Bridges.
