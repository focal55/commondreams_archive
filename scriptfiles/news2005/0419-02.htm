<p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- April 19 -- &#147;Sierra Club strongly opposes any moves to open the Outer Continental Shelf to drilling for hydrocarbons of any sort, including both oil and natural gas. We believe instead that there should be permanent protections for biologically sensitive marine habitats. We oppose lifting the existing moratorium for a number of reasons.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;First and most importantly, our beaches and coastlines are special, irreplaceable places. It is our responsibility to protect them, and the existing moratorium is the primary tool we have used to protect them for over 20 years. Second, allowing drilling off our coasts would have very damaging consequences for our beaches, for marine life and its habitat, and for the broader environment.  Third, any Congressional decisions about drilling for oil and gas off our coasts should be based upon accurate science, and the National Academy of Science has determined we do not have adequate information about appropriate steps yet. Fourth, drilling for oil and gas could have serious consequences for local tourism and fishing economies. Fifth, there is no need to sacrifice our coasts in search of natural gas. Most recoverable natural gas estimated by the Minerals Management Service is already available for leasing, so there is no justifiable reason to turn to our special places for drilling. Finally, there are smarter ways that we can and should address our energy needs rather than allowing our coastlines to be threatened with oil and gas drilling.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;Right now we are at a crossroads in terms of how we produce energy for our country. There are those who believe we should open up most remaining wild and special places to drill for oil and natural gas. We are seeing efforts to open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, record applications for permits to drill for oil and gas in the West, and proposals to open our shorelines to oil and gas drilling. This adds up to an approach where few places, no matter how special, are off limits to oil and gas drilling.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;My strong belief is that there are places that are too special to drill, and some of those areas are along our coasts and beaches. We can choose to set aside invaluable places to preserve for our children, or we can choose to open the majority of our country for oil and gas development. I believe we need to make the choice now for a future where our beaches and offshore waters are free of oil and gas drilling.&#148;</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>This is an excerpt.
