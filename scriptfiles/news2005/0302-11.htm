<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- March 2 -- TV station manager George Servin of Shreveport, La., today announced that local cable stations will resume airing a TV ad by the Campaign for America's Future that highlights the &quot;Snow Job&quot; Rep. James. McCrery (R-La.), is pulling on the people of Louisiana on Social Security. Rep. McCrery had coerced Louisiana stations to stop playing the Campaign for America's Future ad that began airing Monday because he is upset that the ad says he &quot;wants to privatize Social Security and cut our guaranteed benefits.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Campaign for America's Future highlighted Rep. McCrery as an emblem of the increased corruption in Congress on a conference call with reporters last week. The group questioned who stands to benefit most from the decisions Rep. McCrery will make as chair of the Social Security Subcommittee and released an analysis of his campaign finance records before kicking off an ad campaign in his backyard.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Campaign for America's Future Co-director Roger Hickey said the group provided Louisiana cable stations the facts they requested, proving that it is reasonable for the ad to state that Rep. McCrery wants to privatize Social Security and cut our guaranteed benefits.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The White House coerced McCrery to stay in-line on Social Security privatization. Louisiana broadcasters weren't as easily intimidated by McCrery,&quot; said Hickey. &quot;Rep. McCrery should prove that he is not paying back his Wall Street donors by telling President Bush to stay away from cutting benefits for people on Main St. and by not adding trillions to our deficit.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">With polls showing widespread skepticism of President Bush's plan to privatize Social Security, Treasury Secretary John Snow will visit Louisiana this week and President Bush will visit Shreveport next week to help defend Rep. McCrery.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The media buy would've run out before Treasury Secretary Snow arrived in Louisiana, but now our McCrery 'Snow Job' ad will run through Snow's visit,&quot; said Hickey.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">NOTE: Media representatives interested in a copy of ads and the report about Rep. James McCrery's campaign contributions should visit <a href="http://www.ourfuture.org/" target="_new">http://www.ourfuture.org</a>.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">McCRERY &quot;SNOW JOB&quot; AD</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">TIMELINE</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Wed., Feb. 23 -- Campaign for America's Future releases a report that says Rep.
