<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON, D.C. -- Green Party leaders are urging the Senate to reject the 
McCain-Lieberman Climate Stewardship Act, calling the bill an effort to 
subsidize nuclear energy as a way to combat global warming.

</font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The bill repeats earlier failed legislation that would combine mandatory 
caps on carbon dioxide emissions with a credit-trading system modeled after 
the Clean Air Act, and adds incentives for nuclear development ($6.1 billion 
in the recently passed House version; $4.3 billion in the Senate bill).

</font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Greens have called market-based solutions to global warming severely 
inadequate and warn that the dangers of nuclear power are insurmountable.

</font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Democrats and Republicans have turned the need for sound energy policy into 
a choice between suffering the effects of catastrophic climate change and 
the massive accumulation of deadly radioactive waste from nuclear power," 
said Jody Grage Haug, co-chair of the Green Party of the United States.  
"The only rational response to the threat of global warming is a plan that 
phases out fossil fuel and nuclear power, develops clean, renewable energy 
sources, and reduces energy consumption."

</font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Greens, while criticizing the Kyoto Protocols' modest measures to reduce 
greenhouse gas emissions, have called it an important first step, and 
continue to urge the U.S. to sign on and expand its goals.

</font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"By ignoring energy conservation and embracing nuclear power, Democrats and 
Republicans who say they care about global warming have proved themselves 
only marginally better than President Bush," said David Cobb, the Green 
Party's 2004 presidential candidate.  "Nuclear power is expensive, it would 
require the addition of 1,500 new plants worldwide to replace fossil fuel 
energy, it would present an enormous security and public health risk, and 
the storage of nuclear waste would be a permanent and growing environmental 
crisis.

</font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Furthermore, nuclear power does nothing to address the major source of CO2 
emissions -- cars, trucks, and airplanes," Mr. Cobb added.  "But Congress 
and the White House have refused to enact and enforce more stringent fuel 
economy standards, such as the Corporate Average Fuel Economy [CAFE] rules, 
or introduce consumer incentives to reduce demand, because of industry 
pressure."

This hugely inflated buyout was announced in a May 2002 White House ceremony intended to burnish the environmental credentials of both Bushes.
