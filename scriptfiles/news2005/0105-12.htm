Fifteen media assistants (fixers, drivers, translators, technicians, security staff and others) were also killed.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For the second year running, Iraq was the world's most dangerous country for journalists. Nineteen reporters and 12 media assistants were killed there during the year. Terrorist strikes and Iraqi guerrilla attacks were the main cause, but the U.S. army was held responsible for the death of four of them. Ali al-Khatib and Ali Abdel Aziz, of the satellite TV station Al- Arabiya, were shot dead near a U.S. checkpoint on March 18. Ten days later, the U.S. army admitted responsibility but said it was an accident. Assad Kadhim and Hussein Saleh, who worked for the TV station Al-Iraqiya, were killed on April 19, also by U.S. troops.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Journalists killed in 2004</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Bangladesh: 4<br>Brazil: 2<br>Colombia: 1<br>Dominican Republic: 1<br>Gambia: 1<br>Haiti: 1<br>India: 1<br>Iraq: 19<br>Mexico: 3<br>Nepal: 2<br>Nicaragua: 2<br>Pakistan: 1<br>Palestinian Authority: 1<br>Peru: 2<br>Philippines: 6<br>Russia: 2<br>Saudi Arabia: 1<br>Serbia-Montenegro: 1<br>Sri Lanka: 2</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The countries with least press freedom in the world are in East Asia. North Korea, Burma, China, Vietnam and Laos are the region's worst offenders. North Korean journalists are forced to glorify dictator Kim Jong-il and dozens of them have been &quot;re- educated&quot; in camps because of often trivial &quot;professional errors.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">EDITORS: For a more in-depth look at incidents of reporter fatalities around the globe, please visit: <a href="http://www.rsf.org/article.php3?id_article=12233" target="_new">http://www.rsf.org/article.php3?id_article=12233</a></font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
