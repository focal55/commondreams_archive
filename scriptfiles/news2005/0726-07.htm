<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BOSTON - July 25 - Immigrants in the U.S. receive surprisingly little health care - 55% less than native-born Americans -according to a Harvard/Columbia University study that appears in the current issue of the American Journal of Public Health.  Immigrant children received particularly low levels of care, 74% less overall than other children.  </font><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">            According to the study, immigrants accounted for 10.4% of the U.S. population, but only 7.9% of total health spending, and only 8% of government health spending.  Per capita health expenditures averaged $1,139 per immigrant vs. $2,564 for non-immigrants.  30% of immigrants used no healthcare at all in the course of a year.</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">            Most immigrants had health insurance coverage.  Though uninsured immigrants used the least health care of any group - 61% less than US-born persons who were uninsured - even immigrants with coverage used 52% less health care than insured non-immigrants.</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">            Immigrant children received far less care in doctors&#146; offices (71% less than non-immigrant children) and received 72% less prescription medications. Immigrant children had a significantly lower average number of emergency room visits than non-immigrant children. However, their emergency room costs - $45 per child - were nearly three times greater &#150; suggesting that immigrant children forewent care until becoming very ill.</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">            The study is the first nationwide analysis of immigrants&#146; health care expenditures.  The researchers analyzed data on 21,241 people in the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality&#146;s 1998 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, which collects detailed health spending data on a representative cross-section of Americans.  They used statistical techniques to adjust comparisons between immigrants and non-immigrants for differences between the two groups in age, race/ ethnicity income, health status, and insurance status.        </font></p><p> </p><p>            </p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">            Dr. Sarita Mohanty, who led the study while she was at Harvard and is currently an Assistant Professor of Medicine at the University of Southern California, commented: &#147;Our study lays to rest the myth that expensive care for immigrants is responsible for our nation&#146;s high health costs.  The truth is, immigrants get far less care than other Americans.  Further restricting their eligibility for care would save little money and place many immigrants &#150; particularly children &#150; at grave risk. Already, many immigrant children fail to get regular checkups, and as a result more end up needing emergency care, or get no care at all.&#148;</font></p><p> </p><p>            <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;Our data indicates that many immigrants are actually helping to subsidize care for the rest of us.  Immigrant families are paying taxes &#150; including Medicare payroll taxes - and most pay health insurance premiums, but they&#146;re getting only half as much care as other families.&#148;  said Dr. Steffie Woolhandler, a study co-author and co-founder of Physicians for a National Health Program. </font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">            According to study co-author Dr. Olveen Carrasquillo of Columbia University&#146;s College of Physicians and Surgeons: &#147;Latino immigrants had the lowest health expenditures - $962 per person - half those of US-born Latinos ($1,870) and less than one third those of US-born whites ($3,117). The future economic success of the United States depends on a healthy immigrant workforce.  Our findings suggest an urgent need for partnerships between health organizations and community groups to improve access to care, particularly for minority immigrants. This study shows that a national health program that includes all immigrants would cost much less than is widely assumed.&#148;</font></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p align="CENTER"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">###</font></p><!-- #EndEditable -->
