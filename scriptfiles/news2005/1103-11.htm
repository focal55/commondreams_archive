AMSTERDAM / BRUSSELS - November 3 - Man-made chemicals are contaminating the European eel, a species rapidly vanishing from lakes and rivers across Europe, according to a Greenpeace study published today. 

<p>Greenpeace released its report, Swimming in Chemicals [1], just two weeks before the European Parliament and governments of EU member states decide whether to bow to an industry lobby that would weaken proposed EU legislation for greater protection from hazardous chemicals or vote to safeguard our lives and the environment from these dangers.

<p>The study of European eels (Anguilla anguilla) from 20 rivers and lakes in 10 EU countries [2] demonstrates their widespread contamination with brominated flame retardants (BFRs), a group of chemicals used in textiles, plastics and electronic goods and of increasing concern regarding their toxicity. Many of the chemicals found in eels remain in use throughout Europe while others have been phased out since the 1970s. 

<p>“The chemicals industry is lobbying to escape regulation even while hazardous chemicals seep into the environment,” said Helen Perivier of Greenpeace International. “It is time for the European Parliament and national governments in the EU to hold industry accountable for the chemicals it releases into the environment and to protect freshwater ecosystems, wildlife and ourselves from hazardous chemicals for generations to come.”

<p>Results found that eels from every location contained residues of at least one BFR compound, indicating the widespread dispersal of these chemicals in European waters. The highest levels of BFRs were recorded in the eels collected from the River Thames in the UK. The highest level of PCBs was recorded in a sample from the Netherlands (Hollandsdiep). Among the lowest levels of all the contaminants were reported in eels from the west of Ireland. 

<p>Already under severe threat from overfishing, habitat loss and possibly climate change, numbers of young eels returning to some European waters are now thought to be as low as 1% of historic levels. Contamination with persistent toxins may also be an important factor in the decline of this intriguing species believed to migrate thousands of miles from the North Atlantic to Europe. 

<p>Growing evidence indicates that BFRs, which are persistent and bioaccumulative chemicals, exhibit a clear potential for adverse effects in humans and wildlife and that two of the BFR groups examined in this study may adversely impact neurobehavioral development and thyroid hormone systems. 

<p>Greenpeace is urging EU governments and the European Parliament to vote for legislation requiring the chemicals industry to identify and substitute problem chemicals. The European Parliament will vote on the proposed REACH legislation (Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation of Chemicals) [3].

<p>Greenpeace is an independent campaigning organization, which uses non-violent, creative communication tools to put the spotlight on global environmental problems and to drive towards solutions essential for a green and peaceful future.

<p>[2] Belgium, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Poland, Spain, and UK. The eels were donated by members of the fishing and science community or purchased in local markets.

<p>[3] The European Parliament will vote on the REACH proposal on 17 November, and the Council (EU Member States) will form a common agreement on the legislation on 29 November. The chemicals industry, actively supported by EU Industry Commissioner Verheugen, is lobbying for exemptions that would allow it to continue producing and marketing chemicals without providing basic health and safety data for their chemicals. Such a measure would cripple the ability of the REACH legislation to protect health and environment.
