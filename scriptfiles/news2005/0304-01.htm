<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- March 4 --   News Advisory:</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WHAT: Press Conference</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WHEN: Monday, March 7, 9 a.m.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WHERE: National Press Club, 529 14th St., NW, Washington, DC</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DETAILS: Trafficking of women is on the rise in Afghanistan, as is rape, forced marriage, drug use, domestic abuse and senseless acts of everyday violence. In the meantime, a third of women living in Kabul are not permitted to leave their homes. Afghan females in general have no inheritance rights, find it nearly impossible to divorce, and are struggling to regain their health, livelihoods, and a sense of place.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As nonprofit leaders in their homeland, seven Afghan women already touch the lives of thousands. On March 1, they reached U.S. soil to speak directly to policy makers on Capitol Hill, at the World Bank, IMF, the State Department, the United Nations, and even over tea with the Ambassador of Afghanistan, on behalf of their fellow countrywomen.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The delegation, which consists partially of women who have never before left their region, says that while conditions are improving for women in Afghanistan, the situation is far from comfortable. In order for women and girls to experience true equality in their country, U.S. policy must be changed so that loans, grants, trade deals, and foreign aid programs are designed to more directly address women's issues. International Financial Institutions, such as the World Bank and IMF, must also work to ensure that their economic reforms do not undermine women's rights and opportunities in the rebuilding of Afghanistan's economy.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Afghan delegation is working in cooperation with the nonprofit organization, ActionAid International, which provides direct services within nearly 50 countries (including Afghanistan), and the Policy Council on Afghan Women, whose founder, Ms. Malaly Pikar Volpi, is an Afghan refugee.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The delegation includes: Ms. Roshan Sirran, former Deputy Mayor of Kabul City (1980 to 1988); Mary Akrami, Director, Afghan Women Skills Development Center; Hulan Khatibi executive director, Women's Activities and Social Services Association; Marina Nawabi, policy director, Action Aid Afghanistan; Nelofar Qadiri, Women and Children Legal Research Foundation; Gul Maky Siawash, director, Kabul Orthopedic Organization; and Arezo Mohammad Yasin, Educational &amp; Training Center for Poor Women &amp; Girls of Afghanistan. </font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
