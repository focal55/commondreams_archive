<p>WASHINGTON - November 30 - 

<p>Postmaster General John E. Potter
<br>
U.S. Postal Service<br>
475 L'Enfant Plaza, S.W.
<br>
Washington, D.C.  20260
<p>Dear Postmaster General Potter:

	<p>As you know, Parcel Post was introduced almost a century ago to better 
serve the American people.  (Lest we forget, it was introduced because 
parcel delivery companies' adherence to strictly profit generating 
principles was denying good service to large areas of the nation.) 
Regrettably, it appears that there currently may be a policy which is 
intended to make Parcel Post "invisible" to patrons.  I was recently 
surprised to discover that the "2005 Holiday Shipping and Mailing Guide" 
gives shipping deadlines for Global Priority Mail, Global Express Mail, 
Global Express Guaranteed, Priority Mail, and Express Mail, but not 
Parcel Post.

	<p>It has also been brought to my attention that postal clerks are now 
being instructed not to mention the term "Parcel Post" to patrons.  A 
clerk has even been suspended for making a patron aware of Parcel Post 
before trying to push them to use more expensive shipping options. 
Apparently one manager has claimed that "not offering Parcel Post 
will.improve customer satisfaction."  I hope this statement does not 
reflect the position of the Postal Service on this matter.  To state the 
obvious: in numerous instances not offering Parcel Post constitutes bad 
customer service, because very often customers' budgets and time-frames 
for delivery make Parcel Post the service that would best meet their 
needs.  Can you explain what's going on here regarding not including 
Parcel Post in the Mailing Guide and not mentioning it orally at 
customer service counters or on the telephone?


<p>Thank you for your response.


<p>Sincerely,


<br>
Ralph Nader
