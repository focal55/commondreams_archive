<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - July 21 - Experts from the U.S. and Central America warned that the Central America Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA) will undermine access to life-saving treatment for AIDS and other public health problems in the region.</font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CAFTA is expected to be voted on in the House of Representatives next week.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;With CAFTA, the Office of the US Trade Representative, operating at the behest of Big Pharma, has imposed on Central America and the Dominican Republic a trade deal that will deny millions access to life-saving and essential medicines. Through a variety of mechanisms, the trade deal extends monopoly protections for brand-name drug companies, and delays the introduction of generic competition -- the most effective means of lowering the price of pharmaceuticals. For Big Pharma, these are dollars and cents issues writ small.  The region's combined economy is about the size of Columbus, Ohio, and its poor populations mostly cannot afford high-priced brand name pharmaceuticals. But what for Big Pharma is dollars and cents is life and death for the people of Central America. Monopoly prices for pharmaceuticals don't just mean they feel a pinch in their pocketbook -- it means they go without medicines altogether.&quot;<br>           <br>            --Robert Weissman, Co-Director, Essential Action, Washington D.C.<br>            web: <a href="http://www.essential.org" target="_new">www.essential.org</a>; tel: 202.387.8030, c:202.360.1844; e mail: rob@essential.org</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The deal-making currently underway to attempt to pass CAFTA in the US Congress blatantly ignores the needs and interests of people in Central America and the Dominican Republic, particularly the poor who will be further limited in their access to life-saving drugs. If passed, CAFTA will extend drug patents and limit the ability of governments in these countries to introduce generic competition, which is particularly damaging to poor patients who buy medicines out-of-pocket. Trade agreements should offer economic opportunity and development, not impediments to public health.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">            --Stephanie Weinberg, Trade Policy Advisor, Oxfam America<br>            web: <a href="http://www.oxfamamerica.org" target="_new">www.oxfamamerica.org</a>; tel: 202.496.1088; email: sweinberg@oxfamamerica.org</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Almost four years ago, under pressure from poor countries, the Bush Administration signed a declaration at the World Trade Organization Ministerial meeting in Doha pledging that WTO members should prioritize public health and, in particular, access to medicines for all when adopting national rules governing protection of drug company patent rights. The U.S. has broken that promise in CAFTA. In going back on its word, the White House has decided that being at Big Pharma's beck and call is more important than ensuring Central Americans have access to medicines that can save their lives.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">            --Asia Russell, Director of International Policy, Health GAP<br>            web: <a href="http://www.healthgap.org" target="_new">www.healthgap.org</a>; tel: 267.475.2645; email: asia@healthgap.org</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The text of CAFTA is a major score for Big Pharma. In the name of 'free trade', monopolies for medicines are being created or extended beyond what they would be under WTO rules, which are already in place. In the end, it is impossible to justify how adopting intellectual property rules that go well beyond the WTO commitments and even U.S. law is a good idea for poor countries. CAFTA's new rules will cost human lives.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">            --Rom&aacute;n Macaya, Ph.D., Executive Director, National Chamber of Generic Products of Costa Rica<br>            tel: 011 (506) 228-2355, cell 011 506 394 5976; email: rmacaya@rimacsa.com</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To request a transcript of the teleconference: email David Levy at davidlevysixo@cox.net or call 703.205.0989 (c:202 288 2283).  </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To listen to a recording of the teleconference: dial 1-877-519-4471 and enter PIN number 629-6486 (rewind, press 1; fast forward 3; make a 'bookmark' 2; decr. vol 4; incr vol 6;) </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For more issue information:<br></font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">One page 'backgrounders': <br>Intellectual Property &amp; Access to Medicines in Guatemala, by Berta Chete, Association Gente Positiva, Guatemala <br>Oxfam Decries US Pressure on Guatemala to Repeal Medicines Law <br></font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">More detailed analyses: <br>Dying For Drugs: How Cafta Will Undermine Access To Essential Medicines, by Robert Weissman, Essential Action, USA <br>Economic And Social Consequences Of Intellectual Property Rights' Overprotection In CAFTA, by Rom&aacute;n Macaya, National Chamber of Generic Products of Costa Rica <br></font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For more information on sponsoring organizations and issues related to CAFTA, please visit the following web sites:<br>essentialaction.org, <a href="http://www.globalaidsalliance.org" target="_new">globalaidsalliance.org</a>, <a href="http://www.citizen.org/trade" target="_new">citizen.org/trade</a>, oxfamamerica.org, healthgap.org </font></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p align="CENTER">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
