<p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- March 16 -- Today the U.S. Senate, by a vote of 49-51, defeated an amendment by Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.) that would have removed a provision of the Senate budget bill that authorizes energy development in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. The following is a statement by Karen Wayland, legislative director at NRDC (Natural Resources Defense Council).</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Drilling the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge won't make a dent in gas prices at the pump or break our dependence on Middle East oil.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;This was really a vote for Big Oil, not for the solid majority of Americans who oppose turning America's last great wilderness into a vast, polluted oil field.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;President Bush and his Senate allies resorted to a sneaky budget maneuver to get their way. Now, Congress is one step closer to trading away an irreplaceable national treasure for a few drops of oil that we wouldn't see for a decade or more.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;If the oil industry can drill in the Arctic Refuge, then no place, no matter how pristine, will be safe.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;But there is still a lot of political tundra to cross before this fight is over. We'll keep battling every step of the way.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Increasing America's energy security doesn't require selling off our natural heritage and letting oil companies despoil our last best places. Using better technology in our cars and trucks -- so they go farther on a gallon of gas -- would save more than 10 times the amount of oil in the refuge, and save consumers billions of dollars at the pump.&quot;</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>The Natural Resources Defense Council is a national, nonprofit organization of scientists, lawyers and environmental specialists dedicated to protecting public health and the environment.
