<p>NEW YORK - On the heels of Iraq&#8217;s 
constitutional referendum, MADRE, an international women&#8217;s human rights 
organization, is launching a campaign in support of women&#8217;s shelters in Iraq. 
Iraq&#8217;s new constitution poses grave threats to women&#8217;s basic rights, including 
their right to a life free of domestic violence. The constitution posits Islamic 
law as a basic source of national legislation and gives reactionary clerics bent 
on restricting women&#8217;s rights a strong hand in interpreting and enforcing Iraqi 
law.<BR>
&nbsp;<BR>
MADRE Executive Director Vivian Stromberg commented, &#8220;War and 
the rise of religious extremism have already unleashed a wave of violence 
against women in Iraq. Two and a half years after their &#8216;liberation&#8217; at the 
hands of US troops, Iraqi women are experiencing unprecedented levels of &#8216;honor 
killings,&#8217; domestic violence, rape, abduction, and forced marriages. MADRE&#8217;s 
partners in Iraq fear that this trend will escalate with the passage of Iraq&#8217;s 
new constitution.&#8221;<BR>
&nbsp;<BR>
To raise awareness of the crisis and support 
Iraq&#8217;s only network of women&#8217;s shelters founded by MADRE&#8217;s sister organization, 
the Organization of Women&#8217;s Freedom in Iraq, MADRE is mobilizing women around 
the US to host house parties. Dozens of gatherings are being planned where 
people can learn about the real-life impact of the US occupation on Iraqi 
women&#8217;s lives and offer concrete support to Iraqi women who are fighting for 
their basic human rights.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR>
<STRONG><EM>Available for interviews on the rise of 
violence against women in US-occupied Iraq:</EM></STRONG>
<P><STRONG>Yifat Susskind</STRONG>, MADRE&#8217;s Associate Director, was born and 
raised in Israel and was active in the Israeli women's peace movement for 
several years before joining MADRE in 1997. Her critical analysis of US foreign 
policy and women's human rights has appeared in online and print publications 
such as TomPaine.com, Foreign Policy in Focus, and The W Effect: Bush's War on 
Women, published by the Feminist Press in 2004.&nbsp; Ms. Susskind has also been 
featured as a commentator on CNN, National Public Radio, and BBC.&nbsp;</P>
<P><STRONG>Yanar Mohammed</STRONG> is the Director and Founder of MADRE&#8217;s sister 
organization, the Organization of Women&#8217;s Freedom in Iraq (OWFI). Through OWFI, 
Ms. Mohammed has established four shelters to protect Iraqi women from a sharp 
rise in violence since the US invasion. Ms. Mohammed has received death threats 
for her work to further women&#8217;s human rights, but she continues to fight 
publicly against both the US occupation and Islamic fundamentalism. She has 
appeared frequently in the Iraqi and Arab press, and has been featured as a 
commentator in major international media, including The New York Times and CBS 
Evening News. Ms. Mohammed lives in Toronto and Baghdad.</P><!-- #EndEditable -->
