</font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The “Report” was filed with  by James R. Gotcher, General Legal Counsel, USS - LVA, with the Secretary of Defense at the Pentagon on  June 8,  the 38th anniversary of the attack on the USS Liberty. For a complete copy of the brief  go to

</font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">By establishing  prima facie evidence that Israel committed war crimes the Secretary of Defense under existing Dept.

</font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Gotcher was an Air Force intelligence officer in Vietnam  in 1967 and is one of three intelligence officers who were in different parts of the world at the time.

</font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Lloyd Painter, Officer of the Deck on the USS Liberty  and retired secret service agent of 24 years testified  that his  statement mentioned in the report, “that the Israeli torpedo boat crews  machine gunned the USS Liberty inflatable life boats”  was removed from the  final report that was submitted in 1967.
