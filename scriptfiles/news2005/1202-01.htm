<p>WASHINGTON - December 2 - Following is a memo from  Marian Wright Edelman, president, Children's Defense Fund, to  editorial board directors:</p>
<p>   December 2, 2005 </p>
<p>   To: Editorial Board Directors</p>
<p>   From: Marian Wright Edelman, President, Children's Defense  Fund</p>

<p>   Re: Health Coverage for 1,597,806 Children or Tax Cuts for  288,863 of the Wealthiest 1 Percent of US Taxpayers? State by  State Tradeoffs Chart Available </p>
<p>   What is most just and important to America's future?  Health  coverage for 1.6 million children or tax breaks for 289,000 of  the wealthiest Americans?</p>
<p>   Congress will meet in December to vote on a budget bill which  will greatly hurt the poor and children, and on tax bills which  will greatly benefit the wealthiest Americans.  The Senate budget  bill would cut $39 billion.  The House budget bill would cut $50  billion primarily from programs for low income children and  families including Medicaid, foster care, child support, child  care, food stamps, and student loans.  The richest 1 percent of  U.S. taxpayers will reap the majority of the tax breaks from the  capital gains and dividend tax cuts included in the House tax  bill.  </p>
<p>   Nine million American children are uninsured. Almost 90  percent of them live in households where someone works.   An  estimated 5-1/2 million of these children are eligible for  Medicaid and CHIP -- the Children's Health Insurance Program --  but lack health coverage because of poor state outreach and  bureaucratic barriers.  The 25 million children who depend on  Medicaid's health lifeline are the most cost effective  beneficiaries of the program constituting almost half of  Medicaid's enrollment but less than 20 percent of Medicaid costs.   We know that prevention and early intervention pays: every dollar  we spend vaccinating children against measles, mumps and rubella  saves $16 in medical costs to treat those illnesses.  </p>
<p>   I believe that common sense, budget sense and compassion for  the vulnerable should make children the last group any Governor,  Congressperson or President truly concerned about escalating  health care costs should be cutting or undermining. Yet that is  precisely what many of our nation's governors are doing in their  own states and urging Congress to do in the morally obscene and  fiscally irresponsible House budget bill.   </p>
<p>   The National Governors Association proposals, incorporated in  the callous House budget bill, would allow states "flexibility"  to cut Medicaid coverage for more than 6 million children by  imposing premiums and cost sharing for the first time in the  children's portion of Medicaid, and eliminating Medicaid's  guarantee of treatment for children under the comprehensive child  appropriate Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnosis and Treatment  Program.  These draconian cuts and structural changes would  radically alter the Medicaid program for children at a time when  we should be insuring every child. </p>

<p>   These shortsighted actions are a backwards step and frontal  assault on still inadequate health coverage for children.   We  know that premium and co-payment requirements for parents reduce  child health coverage.  We know that wages have stagnated or  declined for eight consecutive years.  We know that child poverty  has increased for four consecutive years.  We know that the loss  of employer based health coverage is soaring.  And we know that  Katrina and Rita victims scattered across America are still being  denied Disaster Relief Medicaid health care because the Bush  Administration and Congress have stonewalled for three months.   Isn't it time to challenge leaders who continue to make choices  that hurt children and the poor? </p>
<p>   I hope every person in America who believes in liberty and  justice will rise up and say no to budget cuts which hurt the  weak and ask children - our poorest group of Americans - and the  working poor to bear the burden of new tax cuts to the rich.  No  to both should be every American's demand.   </p>
