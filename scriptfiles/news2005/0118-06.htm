PTPI announced earlier today that Gary Sinise, award-winning actor and co-founder of Operation Iraqi Children, a program administered by People to People International, generously donated to PTPI's International Friendship Fund to help with this effort.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Mr. Sinise graciously agreed to allow us to announce his participation. It is our hope that people will pick up on his exemplary leadership and make a commitment to our global family in distress,&quot; said PTPI President and Chief Executive Officer Mary Jean Eisenhower. &quot;It is difficult not to feel overwhelmed by such a tragedy when we are half a world away, watching in horror the devastation to so many. We must remember that each of us can make a difference in the lives touched by this tragedy. Reaching out to others is really the most basic kind of peace work and we can start at home.&quot;</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">People to People International is collaborating long term with One Sri Lanka Foundation, -- <a href="http://www.onesrilanka.org/" target="_new">http://www.onesrilanka.org</a> -- which has an office established in Sri Lanka to coordinate the distribution of aid together with the local government, private charities, and other international relief organizations. PTPI is also partnering with HALO Trust -- <a href="http://www.halotrust.org/" target="_new">http://www.halotrust.org</a> -- in the short term effort to help the Sri Lankan tsunami victims. PTPI has worked with both organizations since 2002 on the eradication of landmines and most recently sponsored a de-mining team in the Jaffna peninsula of the country. Its de-mining team temporarily discontinued de-mining activities in order to provide the heavy equipment needed to clear the flooded roads for aid and medical trucks to get through to the affected area. De-mining activities are expected to continue shortly.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Donations to People to People International's Friendship Fund, which can be made online at <a href="http://www.ptpi.org/" target="_new">http://www.ptpi.org</a>, will be used for immediate needs, building temporary shelters and funding supplies. The majority of the funds will be used to build permanent homes for new orphans and their long term needs. One hundred percent of all donations will go towards the relief effort. No administrative costs will be deducted from what is given.</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In a recent message to the organization's global family, Ms. Eisenhower called on members to take action, &quot;This at a time of year when so many of us are so thankful to have so much, anything, any amount will be appreciated more than we can say. The International Friendship Fund has already received its first donations toward this cause, we are asking that you reach out and help us to pool a significant amount to send. This situation is nearly unprecedented in modern times, and we want all those affected, and their loved ones, to know that we are with them during this horrific time.&quot;</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>People to People International with World Headquarters in Kansas City, Mo., USA, was established by President Dwight D. Eisenhower on Sept. 11, 1956 to enhance international understanding and friendship through educational, cultural and humanitarian activities involving the exchange of ideas and experiences directly among peoples of different countries and diverse cultures. Today, as a 501 (c)(3), PTPI has a presence in 125 countries with more than 80,000 families and individuals actively participating in People to People International programs.
