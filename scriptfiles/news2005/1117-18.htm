<p>WASHINGTON – November 17 - Today the Senate Indian Affairs Committee convened for its fifth hearing on tribal lobbying practices concerning indicted lobbyist Jack Abramoff’s duplicitous work for tribal clients. Italia Federici, President of the Council of Republicans for Environmental Advocacy (CREA), was the only witness called to testify. 

<p>Senators John McCain (R-AZ) and Byron Dorgan (D-ND) aggressively questioned Federici regarding her and her tax-exempt organization’s role in working as a conduit between Abramoff and high ranking Department of Interior officials, including Deputy Secretary J. Steven Griles. Based on the stark contrast between Federici’s sworn testimony and her email correspondence with Abramoff, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington’s (CREW) Executive Director Melanie Sloan called on the Committee to refer Federici to the Department of Justice for investigation on potential perjury charges. As evidence, Sloan pointed to Federici’s repeated claims that she provided Abramoff with assistance only with issues pertaining to CREA’s mission. 

<p>In reality, email correspondence reveals that Federici assisted Abramoff with Indian gaming issues. One email, dated December 13, 2002, from Abramoff to Federici bears the subject line, “Michigan Indian gambling expansion” and asked Federici to pass an attachment on to Steve [Griles] directly. Similarly, in a March 17 to March 18, 2003 email exchange between Federici and Abramoff, Abramoff asked Federici to raise an issue regarding a Massachusetts Indian tribe with Griles. Federici replied “I’ll call Steve tonight . . .” and asked for further information on the matter. Abramoff responded by saying he would fax over documents. 

<p>“The Department of Justice should investigate Federici because lying to congressional committees is a federal criminal offense that merits prosecution,” said Sloan.

<p>Additionally, Sloan noted, “The Committee’s job is far from done. Many questions remain unanswered, including the role of many others involved in the Abramoff scandal, including Americans for Tax Reform President Grover Norquist, Century Strategies Founder and President Ralph Reed, Secretary of the Interior Gale Norton and former Majority Leader Tom DeLay.” Sloan continued, “Without hearing from these witnesses, all of whom are implicated by email correspondence the Committee has released, it will be impossible for the Committee to prepare a thorough report on the extent of the Abramoff scandal. The American public has a right to know the full extent of official Washington’s participation in Abramoff’s illegal activities.”
