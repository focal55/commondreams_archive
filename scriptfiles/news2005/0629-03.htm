<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - June 29 -Democratic Chief Deputy Whip <a href="http://www.house.gov/degette" target="_new">Diane DeGette</a> (CO-01) today sharply rebuked President   George W. Bush following his   address to the nation on the war in Iraq:<br></font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Once again, the President of United States felt he   had to explain to the American public and our brave   troops in Iraq why   the war there, and the war on terror, are not going   as expected.  I was very disappointed that, once   again, he failed to talk   straight to us and, instead, continued to push the   fallacy that somehow Iraq is linked to 9/11.    Because of poor Administration   planning and execution in Iraq and Afghanistan, our   brave G.I.s face situations much tougher and much   more deadly than should be the   case.       	<br></font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The issue is not of perception but of prosecution.   It took the U.S. 1,365 days after Pearl Harbor to   defeat both Germany and   Japan in World War II. Yet, at the rate this   Administration is going, it will take far more than   1,365 days to make Iraq secure and   it is already more than 1,365 days since 9/11 and we   have still not captured or killed Osama bin Laden.<br></font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">        	Frankly, I am outraged that, because of this   Administration's poor planning and adherence to   failed ideology, Osama bin   Laden and the murderers of 9/11 are still on the   loose, that the insurgency continues to grow in Iraq   and that the Taliban appears   to be rebuilding in Afghanistan.  America deserves   better and, most certainly, our soldiers deserve   better.&quot;<br></font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><center>###</center></font></p><!-- #EndEditable -->
