Japan in particular is blocking progress in global development. Protestors are demanding an agreement on 100% multilateral debt cancellation without harmful conditions by April 16-17, when the IMF and World Bank hold their Spring Meetings.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When:  March 15, 2005, 2 - 5 pm</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Where: Protest will start at the French Embassy, Washington, DC and then participants will demonstrate at the German Embassy and the Japanese Embassy.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Protest schedule: 2:20pm French Embassy, 4101 Reservoir Road, NW 2:40pm German Embassy, 4645 Reservoir Road, NW 3:40pm Japanese Embassy, 2520 Massachusetts Avenue NW</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Background:  While governments acted quickly to pledge large amounts to respond to the tsunami in south Asia, there has been less political will regarding AIDS and debt. In terms of the death toll, AIDS, Tb and malaria equal the impact of the tsunami every two weeks.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Every year, many impoverished countries spend more on debt service than they pay on social services like health care and education. Yet, negotiations among the G8 over debt cancellation have reached an impasse, and the G8 meeting in July may fail to agree on full cancellation for debts owed to the IMF and World Bank. Protestors are demanding an agreement on 100% multilateral debt cancellation without harmful conditions by April 16-17, when the IMF and World Bank hold their Spring Meetings</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>The Global Fund is a critical part of the fight against AIDS, TB and malaria, yet it is facing a $900 million shortfall in 2005.  It lacks the necessary funds to move forward with the renewal of prior grants and the issuing of new grants in 2006. This is a matter of life and death for millions around the world.  The pledged contributions to the Fund from France, Germany and United Kingdom for 2006 are the same as for 2005, even though the Fund's needs will increase dramatically in 2006.  Japan has failed to pledge any contribution whatsoever for 2005 or 2006. These governments, as well as the US, should give their fair share according to their proportion of global wealth. Governments will consider the Fund's needs at a Meeting on a Voluntary Replenishment Mechanism in Stockholm, Sweden, 14-16 March 2005.</i></font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
