<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->WASHINGTON - November 3 - After failing to strip out a provision to allow oil drilling in the Arctic Refuge as part of the Budget bill, the Senate today narrowly approved a budget reconciliation package that moves the controversial issue oil drilling another step forward. The Senate bill passed 52-47. This disappointing action sets the stage for a critical vote in the House next week, where it's future is anything but certain. If the House succeeds in muscling through its version of the budget, the different versions will be reconciled and each body will have to vote one final time.

<p>"Having failed to win passage of Arctic drilling in the past, we are greatly disappointed that the Senate chose to sneak the controversial issue into the massive budget reconicilition package," said Carl Pope, Sierra Club Executive Director. "But allowing oil drilling in a national wildlife refuge is oppsed by a majority of Americans, and in the end we believe that including drilling in the budget bill will jeopardize final passage of the budget."

<p>"We are dismayed and distressed, particularly at those Senators who voted for this Reconciliation package even though it is inconsistent with their values. They have done so knowing that the final Conference budget which they facilitated today will be even further from their values and their beliefs."

<p>Earlier today, the Senate defeated by a vote of 48-51 an amendment by Senator Maria Cantwell (D-WA) that would have stripped drilling revenues from the budget.

<p>In an unusual twist given the history of the fight to protect the Arctic Refuge, it is the House where opposition to Arctic drilling schemes has generated some of the most intense scrutiny. The House reconciliation bill includes controversial provisions to drill in the long-protected Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, destructive mining provisions and a provision to revoke the 24-year old moratorium on offshore drilling An increasing number of House members have been outspoken in their opposition to Arctic Refuge drilling in the budget bill, casting serious doubt on whether a bill with Arctic drilling in it can pass the House at all.

<p>"At a time when oil companies are making record profits to the tune of billions of dollars, how does Congress still think it's a good idea to give them the keys to the Arctic Refuge and our coasts?," asked Pope. "The oil industry is happy to line our coasts and wilderness with oil rigs while lining their pockets with profits."

<p>A new report from the Department of Energy estimates that even 20 years down the road, when Arctic Refuge oil is at or near peak production, gas prices would be affected by about a penny per gallon. Moreover, the figures put forward in the reconciliation package are highly speculative at best. Both the House and Senate assume $2.4 billion in revenues from Arctic drilling, a number that is inflated to 80 times the going rate for oil leases in the region.

<p>"The speculative revenue numbers and too fuzzy and the issue of oil drilling in the Arctic Refuge is too important to the American public and future generations to sneak through in the budget bill," said Pope.

<p>"We cannot continue repeat the same mistakes of the past, nor can we drill our way to energy independence. The knee-jerk reaction to put more oil rigs up in hurricane-prone waters and industrialize the Arctic Refuge wouldn't save consumers money but would rob our children of their natural heritage."
