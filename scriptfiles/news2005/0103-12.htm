<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- January 3 --  Nearly 3,600 military veterans and military family members have expressed grave concerns about Alberto R. Gonzales, President Bush&#146;s nominee for U.S. Attorney General in a letter to members of the Senate Judiciary Committee and other members of the U.S. Senate.   The veterans&#146; primary concerns are Judge Gonzales' positions on U.S. adherence to the Geneva Conventions and protections from torture for military personnel under international and U.S. laws.</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">            The letter to Congress cites Gonzales' controversial January 2002 memorandum advising President George W. Bush that he could exempt al Qaeda and Taliban prisoners from Geneva Convention protections, and an August 2003 Justice Department memo approved by Gonzales, which attempted to redefine torture.  According to The Washington Post, the Justice Department last week reversed its position on the legality of torture of prisoners of war.  &#147;Acting Assistant Attorney General Daniel Levin said in the new memo that torture may consist of acts that fall short of provoking excruciating and agonizing pain and thus may include mere physical suffering or lasting mental anguish.&#148; (Washington Post, 12/31/04)</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">            The veterans groups and other signatories argue that an approval of the Gonzales nominations for U.S. attorney general would have a negative impact on the U.S. military and our nation&#146;s mission in Iraq, potentially exposing U.S. and coalition prisoners to more cruelty and violence by insurgents, including torture by their captors.</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">            Please join us for a press conference outlining the key reasons for veterans and allied groups&#146; opposition of the Gonzales nomination for U.S. Attorney General on the  eve of his Senate confirmation hearing.</font></p><p> </p><p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WHO:</font></b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">             Charles Sheehan-Miles, Executive Director, Veterans for Common Sense, </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">                        1991 Gulf War veteran</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">                        Robert K.
