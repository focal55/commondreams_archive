<p>WASHINGTON - December 15 - Following is a  statement from Raymond C. Offenheiser, president Oxfam America,  on the current trade talks underway in Hong Kong and the current  budget reconciliation debate on Capitol Hill:</p>
<p>   &quot;Two major opportunities have surfaced this week to help  millions of people living in poverty in America and in developing  countries: the budget reconciliation on Capitol Hill and the  World Trade Organization's Ministerial in Hong Kong. These two  debates carry so much potential.</p>
<p>   Sadly, both miss the mark. </p>
<p>   &quot;Through the budget process, Members of Congress could choose  to advance policies that would help small farmers in the US and  developing countries by shifting money away from misguided  commodity payments into more nutrition and conservation programs.  Not only would this improve a system that benefits huge  agribusinesses and hurts family farmers, it would also send the  right message to negotiators in Hong Kong that the U.S. is  serious about subsidy reform and a balanced trade policy.</p>
<p>   &quot;Similarly, the WTO negotiations offer a chance to help people  living in poor countries and American farmers by reforming our  trade laws to help -- not hurt -- the world's poorest people.  To  do so, the US and other wealthy nations must agree to reform a  system that bleeds billions of dollars a year in the form of  agricultural subsidies; most to the wealthiest producers.</p>
<p>   &quot;Yet both processes are leaning toward different choices that  maintain the status quo and fail to provide relief for those who  need it most. Congress has decided it would be wiser to find its  budgetary savings by cutting conservation programs and food  stamps. On the other side of the world at the Hong Kong  Ministerial, the wealthiest nations are not willing to make the  concessions promised long ago, led by the European Union, who  won't budge on negotiations to grant access to largely closed  agricultural markets.</p>
<p>   &quot;A misguided budget process in Washington only contributes to  the stalled talks in Hong Kong.  The U.S. Congress should  reinforce efforts to move subsidy reform forward in international  negotiations by limiting subsidies in the federal budget.  </p>
<p>   &quot;For example, last month, Senators Grassley and Dorgan made an  effort to cap payments to our largest farmers including the large  cotton farmers. This effort failed to pass in the Senate which  now hinders the ability of the U.S. to negotiate subsidies with  confidence at the WTO Ministerial. The U.S. delegation to the WTO  needs the full support of the US Congress here at home if they  are going to successfully drive meaningful trade reform on the  world stage.&quot;</p>
