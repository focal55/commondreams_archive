<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->LOS ANGELES - September 13 - A national street date is set for Academy Award winning actor/director Tim Robbins' "Embedded Live" DVD on September 20 in acknowledgement of the International Day of Peace, which is September 21.  The filmed version of his acclaimed play, "Embedded Live," will be distributed on DVD broadly through home entertainment retail channels by Cinema Libre Studio, which has partnered on this title with Netflix.

 

<p>The play, a fictionalized story about the Iraq war and the journalists who covered it, was written and directed by Robbins.  He also stars in the play.  The filmed version was shot live during an off-Broadway run in New York

 

<p>Robbins was inspired to write Embedded Live "by (his) frustration with the duplicity and deception of the Bush administration in the months before the Iraq war and the media's compliance with it."  First as a play and now as a film, "Embedded Live' has had audience support from Los Angeles to New York; from London to Washington D.C, to Phoenix, Seattle, Minnesota and Boston.  He adds, "I am pleased that the release of 'Embedded Live' on DVD will make it available all over the US as more and more people begin to question our involvement in Iraq."

 

<p>"Embedded Live" was shot with nine cameras and edited in a fast-paced style, featuring music by The Clash, System of a Down, Public Enemy and Bob Dylan.  The film features Robbins, and the acclaimed theatre group The Actors' Gang in a moving and satirical multi-story tale of soldiers, journalists and government insiders involved in a fictional mid-east war. Netflix initially had the exclusive distribution rights to the DVD and has been promoting it to its members since late May.  Cinema Libre Studio will release an expanded version with extras including resource guides and a photo gallery.  More information can be found at www.embeddedlive.com.

<p>The International Day of Peace was established by a United Nations resolution in 1981 when the United Nations General Assembly decided that it would be appropriate "to devote a specific time to concentrate the efforts of the United Nations and its Member States, as well as of the whole of (hu)mankind, to promoting the ideals of peace and to giving positive evidence of their commitment to Peace," according to the International Day of Peace Organization (www.internationaldayofpeace.org). 

<p>Robbins, currently in South Africa filming "Hot Stuff" with director Phillip Noyce, will observe the International Day of Peace by observing a moment of silence.
