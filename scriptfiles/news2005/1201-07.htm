<p>PHILADELPHIA - December 1 - December 1, designated World AIDS Day, is seen as a time to remember those who have died as a result of the HIV/AIDS pandemic, to educate and to organize to end this deadly epidemic. 

<p>This year the American Friends Service’s Committee’s Life Over Debt Campaign commemorates World AIDS Day with an emphasis on holding governments and the international community accountable to honoring their commitments to stop AIDS. 

<p>25.8 million Continental Africans are infected with HIV/AIDS; making up over half of the worlds 40.3 million people with the disease.

 

<p>Given this reality we feel it is untenable for the IMF and World Bank to force indebted and impoverished African nations to complete a program of controversial, rigid and often damaging economic reforms in order to be eligible for debt cancellation. 

 

<p>This process deems only 14 Africa countries eligible for cancellation, leaves 33 African countries in critical need of debt cancellation and exasperates the African healthcare crisis in all of sub-Saharan Africa.   As a result, Africans continue to pay billions of dollars annually to service predominately illegitimate debts, at their own expense.

 

<p>We recognize that cancellation of the African Continent’s Debt is a major part of the solution to the HIV/AIDS pandemic.   

 

<p>We hope you will join with us on this World AIDS day.  

 

<p>Below are a few things you can do RIGHT NOW to educate yourself, connect with others involved in the fight against the Continent of Africa’s Odious Debt and HIV/AIDS pandemic:
