<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->WASHINGTON - September 9 -  Democratic Chief Deputy Whip Diana DeGette (CO-01) raised serious concerns about the management of the Hurricane Katrina relief effort today as the House debated providing $51.8 billion in aid to the Gulf Coast, including $50 billion for the Federal Emergency Management Agency. 

<p>"Almost everyone agrees that we have an obligation to provide the funding the Gulf Coast needs to recover and rebuild from Hurricane Katrina. But, the last thing we can afford is more poor planning, oversight or execution by this government," said Rep. DeGette. "Given its performance to date I have very grave doubts about FEMA's ability to manage this $50 billion effectively. Unfortunately, this plan was rushed through Congress without including needed accountability or oversight of FEMA. While we need to get this funding to the victims as quickly as possible, Congress must do better to ensure that it is spent prudently." 

<p>In addition to voting for the initial recovery funding, Rep. DeGette took several steps to help ensure that our nation will be protected if another natural disaster - or a terrorist attack - occurs. This includes:

<p>
<ul>
<li>Introducing a plan on September 6 to restore the Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA) independence as a cabinet-level agency run by directors with emergency response experience. During the 1990s, FEMA received widespread praise for its management and response under this model.<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>Holding hearings in the Energy and Commerce Committee on September 7 into the impact of Hurricane Katrina on gas prices and the ability of states or the federal government to prevent price gouging.<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>Calling for a truly bipartisan, independent commission to investigate what went wrong with the disaster response at each level of government and how it can be fixed it as quickly as possible.<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>Demanding that the federal government hold officials in charge of the disaster response accountable, including firing them as needed.

</li>
</ul>
<p>"There has to be heads rolling for the lapses in response that occurred in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina," said Rep. DeGette. "I do not understand why Michael Brown has not already been fired and replaced with someone who knows what they are doing, like former FEMA director James Lee Witt."
