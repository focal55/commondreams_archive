<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> WASHINGTON - July 28 - Today, ExxonMobil, the world's largest and most profitable private oil company, announced its 2nd quarter earnings - a windfall for ExxonMobil, but not for America.  Instead of using the $7.84 billion in earnings to move the world toward a more sustainable energy future, ExxonMobil will spend millions of it on lobbyists and pseudo-scientists working to cast false doubt on the facts of global warming, and millions more lobbying to drill in America's most pristine wilderness areas, including Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.</font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br>Based on its track record, ExxonMobil will not use its profits to promote renewable energy and fuel efficiency, or pay the $4.5 billion in punitive damages to the Alaskan communities injured by the Exxon Valdez oil spill.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;It's becoming increasing clear that, from an environmental standpoint, what's good for ExxonMobil economically is not good for America,&quot; said Dr. James Barrett, Economist and Director of the Sustainable Economics Program for Redefining Progress.  &quot;The price for Exxon's policies, which offer no alternatives to America's oil dependence, hurts our families, our nation's businesses, and the environment as a whole.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Thanks to ExxonMobil's refusal to pay the $4.5 billion dollars in court-ordered punitive damages to victims of the Exxon Valdez oil spill, thousands of fishing industry workers like me were forced out of the business or in a number of cases had to declare bankruptcy,&quot; said Ross Mullins, founder and chairman of the Prince William Sound Fishermen Plaintiffs' Committee.  &quot;With its huge profits in 2005, ExxonMobil could easily afford to comply with the court order and pay for its damages from the horrible oil spill 16 years ago.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To coincide with ExxonMobil's profit announcements, the ExxposeExxon campaign reached out to Americans across the country to educate them on how ExxonMobil refuses to use its record profits to promote a clean environment and healthy communities.  In the last two weeks alone, over 100,000 people sent letters to ExxonMobil raising these concerns.  Specifically, the campaign highlighted how the Texas-based oil giant has consistently fought against real energy solutions for Americans:</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">   As increased demand for dwindling world oil and gas supplies earned<br>   ExxonMobil a record-breaking $25.3 billion in net income in 2004,<br>   company executives dismissed suggestions that they invest in renewable<br>   energy, calling it &quot;uneconomic.&quot;<br>   ExxonMobil continues to challenge the 1994 court ruling ordering the<br>   company to pay $4.5 billion in punitive damages to fisherman and others<br>   injured by the Exxon Valdez oil spill.<br>   ExxonMobil is the only oil company remaining in Arctic Power, the<br>   single-issue group lobbying to open the Arctic Refuge to drilling.<br>   Between 1998 and 2004, ExxonMobil gave more than $15 million to<br>   organizations working to hide the facts about global warming and spent<br>   millions more trying to block meaningful action to address this urgent<br>   problem.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Americans want clean sources of energy that protect public health, reduce pollution, curb global warming, and save consumers money. Instead, ExxonMobil has worked to make America more dependent on oil.  ExxposeExxon is contacting Americans across the country and asking them to help &quot;ExxposeExxon&quot; by:</font></p><p>   <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Speeding Past&quot; Exxon and Mobil gas stations, and refusing to buy the<br>   company's gas or products;<br>   Not buying ExxonMobil stock, and if you have it, using the shares to<br>   change the company's environmental policies; and<br>   Not working for ExxonMobil, and finding a more environmentally conscious<br>   employer.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Ironically, Exxon's profit announcement comes the same week that Congress is posed to pass its polluting Energy Bill that funnels billions of taxpayer dollars to dirty oil and coal industries, and opens up our coastlines and wildlands to destructive oil and gas activities.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Don't ask ExxonMobil what we should do about global warming or oil dependence that drives up gasoline prices and threatens our national security -  they like things just fine the way they are,&quot; said David Hamilton, Director of Global Warming for the Sierra Club.  &quot;Meanwhile, Americans continue to lack real energy alternatives, glaciers continue to melt from global warming, and ExxonMobil continues to pull the strings of America's energy policy.&quot;<br></font></p><p></p><p></p><div align="CENTER"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">###</font></div><!-- #EndEditable -->
