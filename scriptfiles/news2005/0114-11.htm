<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- January 14 -- The Department of Justice Inspector General has released an unclassified version of its report on allegations made by FBI whistleblower Sibel Edmonds. The report confirms that Ms. Edmonds' allegations had merit and deserved further investigation. It also lends weight to the argument made by open government groups that Attorney General John Ashcroft invoked the rarely-used state secrets privilege to hide FBI failures rather than protect national security secrets. The report can be viewed here:<a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/oig/igspecr1.htm" target="_new"> http://www.usdoj.gov/oig/igspecr1.htm</a></font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Later this month, the Project On Government Oversight, the National Security Archive, the Government Accountability Project, and organizations representing familities of survivors of the 9/11 attacks will submit an amicus brief with the District Court of Appeals asking that the state secrets priviliege be lifted over Ms. Edmonds' case. Representatives of these groups will be available for interview at a noon news conference at the National Press Club on Wednesday, January 26.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">American Civil Liberties Union filed a legal brief on behalf of Ms. Edmonds on January 12.
