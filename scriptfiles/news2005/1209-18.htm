<p>NEW YORK - December 9 - In the wake of the 1,000th death penalty execution in the modern 
era, the American Civil Liberties Union today announced the hiring of John 
Holdridge as the new director of its Capital Punishment Project.&nbsp; The 
project is expanding its resources and programs to now include litigation in 
addition to public education as part of the ACLU&#8217;s longstanding effort to end 
the death penalty in the United States.&nbsp; </P>
<P>&#8220;John Holdridge is one of the nation&#8217;s premier death penalty litigators,&#8221; 
said Anthony D. Romero, Executive Director of the ACLU.&nbsp; &#8220;He has fought the 
death penalty in courtrooms around the country for more than a decade, and now 
brings that expertise and commitment to the ACLU.&#8221;&nbsp; </P>
<P>Holdridge will build on the successful public education and advocacy programs 
that have been the hallmark of the ACLU&#8217;s Capital Punishment Project by 
expanding the scope of the project to include litigation.&nbsp; &#8220;The Project 
will focus on cases that highlight the unfairness and inequality of the death 
penalty system,&#8221; according to Steven R. Shapiro, the ACLU&#8217;s National Legal 
Director.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Prior to his appointment at the ACLU, Holdridge was a public defender in 
Connecticut&#8217;s Capital Defense and Trial Services Unit and, before that, he spent 
11 years as director of the Mississippi and Louisiana Capital Trial Assistance 
Project in New Orleans.&nbsp; In these capacities, Holdridge has represented 
numerous clients at trial, on appeal, and in post-conviction proceedings.&nbsp; 
These clients include Michael Graham and Larry Maxwell, both innocent defendants 
who faced death by execution and were later freed.</P>
<P>Holdridge wrote the pleadings and co-argued the seminal case of State v. 
Peart, in which the Louisiana Supreme Court recognized that indigent defendants 
have a right to effective counsel and that the overwhelming caseloads of the 
indigent defender system in New Orleans violated that right.&nbsp; He is a 
graduate of New York University School of Law and in 2001 received the National 
Legal Aid &amp; Defender Association&#8217;s Life in the Balance Achievement 
Award.</P>
<P>&#8220;I look forward to my tenure with the ACLU&#8217;s Capital Punishment Project with 
great anticipation,&#8221; said Holdridge.&nbsp; &#8220;The ACLU has a proud tradition of 
opposing the death penalty, and I am excited to build on those efforts through 
strategic litigation and public advocacy.&#8221;<!-- #EndEditable -->
