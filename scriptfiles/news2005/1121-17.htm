<p>NEW YORK - November 21 - Porter Goss, the director of the 
Central Intelligence Agency, has made misleading statements about 
the CIA's use of torture and mistreatment of detainees, Human Rights 
Watch said today. Goss was quoted today in USA Today stating that 
the CIA does not use torture and that the CIA's interrogation 
techniques are legal.

<p>"A growing body of evidence shows that the CIA has tortured 
detainees," said Kenneth Roth, executive director of Human Rights 
Watch. "Many interrogation techniques authorized for use by the CIA 
amount to torture. Their authorization by higher-ranking officials is 
illegal and potentially criminal."   
  
<p>Goss is quoted as saying: "This agency does not do torture. Torture 
does not work. We use lawful capabilities to collect vital information, 
and we do it in a variety of unique and innovative ways, all of which 
are legal and none of which are torture."   
  
<p>But contrary to Goss's assertions, the CIA is alleged to have 
authorized interrogation techniques which do constitute torture, and 
which the United States has historically considered as such.   
  
<p>A November 18 ABC News report quoted several CIA officials stating 
that CIA leadership approved six interrogation techniques in March 
2002 for use against detainees held at CIA-run facilities in 
Afghanistan. The techniques included slaps, sleep deprivation, forced 
standing, exposure to cold, and "waterboarding," in which 
interrogators immerse or pour water over a detainee's face until he 
believes he will suffocate or drown.   
  
<p>Waterboarding is intended to cause a victim to believe he is about to 
die, and is similar to a mock execution. Earlier this year, in March 
2005, Goss justified waterboarding as a "professional interrogation 
technique" during a Senate hearing. Other Bush administration 
officials, when questioned about waterboarding, have refused to rule it 
out.   
  
<p>There is no doubt that waterboarding is torture, despite the 
administration's reluctance to say so," said Roth.   
  
<p>Waterboarding is prohibited under international law and domestic U.S. 
law. Known as the "submarino" in Latin America, where it was used 
extensively in the 1970s and 1980s, waterboarding has been 
condemned as torture for decades.   
  
<p>Other techniques described in the November 18 ABC News report- prolonged forced standing, sleep deprivation, and exposure to cold- are illegal and may possibly amount to torture. These techniques were 
used by Soviet and North Korean interrogators, and have been 
reported more recently in Egypt, Burma, Iran and Turkey. For 
descriptions of these techniques and their effects - both historical 
examples and accounts from the State Department's own human rights 
reports please visit: <a href="http://hrw.org/english/docs/2005/11/21/usdom12071.htm%20">http://hrw.org/english/docs/2005/11/21/usdom12071.htm </a>
<p>The administration has argued that the CIA has and should continue to 
have latitude to use techniques that are "cruel, inhumane, or 
degrading" so long as the victim is a non-American held abroad. This 
claim is wholly at odds with international law.   
  
<p>Human Rights Watch renewed its call for Congress to appoint an 
independent, bipartisan commission to examine interrogation 
practices. In light of Attorney General Alberto Gonzales' conflict of 
interest as an architect of U.S. interrogation policy, Human Rights 
Watch also called on the Bush administration to appoint a special 
prosecutor to investigate criminal activity in the military and CIA, 
including the conduct of military and civilian officials.

by the CIA, please visit: <a href="http://hrw.org/english/docs/2005/11/21/usdom12071.htm%20">http://hrw.org/english/docs/2005/11/21/usdom12071.htm
