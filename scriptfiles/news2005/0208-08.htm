<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- February 8 -- In the budget proposal submitted to Congress for fiscal year 2006, President Bush has cancelled many important, valuable health programs - while sharply increasing taxpayer spending for abstinence-only censorship programs. Reports indicate that the budget proposes an additional $38 million for abstinence-only programs, bringing the yearly total to $206 million. Such programs have seen their funding increase more than 50% since 2004, despite the fact that they are largely unproven, and as a recent Texas A&amp;M report indicates, unsuccessful. This is in spite of the fact that Bush cancels other important health programs, claiming the need for belt-tightening.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">NARAL Pro-Choice America President Nancy Keenan said: &#147;This budget proposal speaks volumes about President Bush&#146;s priorities. This action flies in the face of his State of the Union speech in which he said, 'taxpayer dollars must be spent wisely, or not at all.' He says he&#146;s against abortion, but rather than provide young people with all the facts, he increases funding for unproven abstinence-only programs that censor, mislead, and misinform. His budget would add $38 million to these unproven abstinence-only programs, yet cut $301 million from programs that train doctors at children's hospitals. He wraps himself in the flag, but cuts health and retirement benefits for veterans. It seems clear that this president places politics above the health and individual liberty of Americans.&#148;</font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
