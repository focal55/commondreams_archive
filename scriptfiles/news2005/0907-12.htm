<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->WASHINGTON - September 7 - Harsh new provisions under federal bankruptcy law set to go into effect
in mid-October should be delayed for at least one year for people whose lives, finances or business were directly
impacted by Hurricane Katrina, according to the Consumer Federation of America (CFA) and the National Association
of Consumer Bankruptcy Attorneys (NACBA).<br>
<br>
CFA and NACBA warned that, in the absence of the enactment of such emergency relief by Congress, thousands
victims of Hurricane Katrina could face a cruel second blow when they try to take steps to put their lives and finances
back together. The two groups urged that the delayed implementation cover those who already were in financial
trouble and planned to file before the new law became effective on October 17, 2005, and those who have been driven
into bankruptcy because of Katrina and need time to regroup and get their records together. These natural disaster
victims already have been devastated and should be allowed to file under the more flexible current law, according to
the two groups.
<br>
<br>
CFA Legislative Director Travis Plunkett said:<b> &#147;Bankruptcy is an important safety net that families hit by
unforeseen circumstances depend upon. The federal government should be bending over backwards to help
Katrina&#146;s victims get back on their feet, not throwing up new barriers to bankruptcy. The new law's harshest
provisions that impose the biggest hurdles to bankruptcy should be permanently waived for victims of
Hurricane Katrina. &#148;</b><br>
<br>
Brad Botes is a member of the NACBA board of directors and a principal in Bond &amp; Botes, a law firm with offices in
Mississippi, Alabama, Florida and Tennessee, including one office blown away by Katrina. Botes said: <b>&#147;What we
really need to do here is avoid kicking hurricane victims when they already are down. Unfortunately, the new
bankruptcy law deliberately removes the flexibility and &#145;give&#146; in the old system that made it possible for
attorneys and judges to work with people in disaster situations and find a way to meet their often quite dire
needs. If Katrina victims are socked with the new bankruptcy law, they will find their already difficult
circumstances made even worse by a rigid system that will force bankruptcy judges to, in effect, ignore the
plight of thousands of indiviuals devastated by one of the worst disaster in U.S. history.&#148;</b><br>
<br>
CFA and NACBA urged Congress to permanently waive the following provisions for Hurricane Katrina victims:<br>
<br>
<ul>
<li>The six month look-back period for income, the unrealistic expense guidelines and other provisions of the means
test. Why should someone who has lost her job as a result of Katrina either have to wait six months to file for
bankruptcy or go to court to prove the obvious ...that she lost her job and no longer has income? At the same time,
the unrealistic IRS expense guidelines assume consumers pay roughly $1.60 for a gallon of gas, don't take into
account extended stays in hotels, and so on.<br>
</li>
<li><br>
Credit counseling. People driven into financial ruin by a natural disaster do not need counseling on how to use
their credit more wisely; they need immediate relief from the bankruptcy system.<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>Landlord lifting of the automatic stay. The new law will make it easier for landlords to remove the &#147;automatic
stay&#148; on creditor actions that occurs when a person files for bankruptcy. This will make it significantly easier for
landlords to evict tenants in bankruptcy and will prevent tenants from using the bankruptcy system to get current
on their rent. Families forced to relocate because of the hurricane should not face the possibility of homelessness a
second time<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>Paperwork requirements. The new law imposes extensive new requirements for the production of documentation,
including tax returns, paycheck stubs, and other paperwork. These new requirements, coupled with strict deadlines
for production upon the penalty of an automatic dismissal are difficult for the most organized person to meet, never
mind someone who has had his or her home destroyed by Katrina.
<br>
<br>
Brad Botes added: &#147;These proposed changes to the bankruptcy law are the minimum first step that Congress should
take to help Katrina&#146;s victims. We may very well ask for additional changes/delays as the full impact of Katrina is felt
throughout the American economy. While the economic effects of Katrina in the immediate disaster area are obvious
to all, the damage to our nation's economy is just beginning to be understood. As Katrina has illustrated in the most
vivid manner, many American families face the very real prospect of being pushed over the financial edge by an
unexpected event, such as a natural disaster, serious illness or a job layoff.&#148;<br>
