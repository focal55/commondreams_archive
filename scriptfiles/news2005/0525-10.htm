<p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- May 25 -- </font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">THEODORE LOWI, <a href="mailto:tjl7@cornell.edu" target="_new">tjl7@cornell.edu</a>, <br><a href="http://falcon.arts.cornell.edu/Govt/faculty/Lowi.html" target="_new">http://falcon.arts.cornell.edu/Govt/faculty/Lowi.html</a><br>    Lowi is Professor of American Institutions at Cornell University and author of several books including &quot;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0393090000/commondreams-20-ref=nosim" target="_new">The End of Liberalism</a>.&quot; He said today: &quot;It was very sad to see the Democrats draw their 'line in the sand' on the filibuster, given the history of the use of the filibuster by Southern Democratic segregationists -- people who are now Republicans. But the Democrats would not even hold that line and have continued in their cowardly fashion. They agree to only use the filibuster in 'extraordinary' circumstances -- which is when it has always been used. It's hard to see how Bush's judicial nominees could become more dubious than the bunch the Democrats have allowed. The Democrats are in the minority, but they can play the role of a loyal opposition -- they can abstain on votes, they can insist that things be done in public and not behind closed doors, they can assert a principled stance by refusing to participate in -- indeed walking out on -- processes which they will lose in any case. Their principle should be: If you don't seek our advice, you won't get our consent.&quot;</font></p><p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Rev. GRAYLAN HAGLER, <a href="mailto:gshagler@earthlink.net" target="_new">gshagler@earthlink.net</a>, <a href="http://www.mrsej.org/" target="_new">http://www.mrsej.org</a><br>    The front pages of many newspapers in the U.S. today feature a picture of President Bush holding Trey Jones, a baby adopted while an embryo. Bush is widely expected to veto a bill on stem cell research. Hagler is national president of Ministers for Racial, Social and Economic Justice and is pastor at the Plymouth Congregational Church UCC in Washington, D.C. He said today: &quot;The Democrats have failed to articulate issues and act in a manner that makes clear who they are and who they represent. Bush is able <br>to portray himself as 'pro-life' while his policies have killed people. He has sent folks into harm's way in Iraq and his waging war has killed we don't know how many Iraqis. When Bush was governor of Texas he signed more death warrants than any other governor. If you have principles and moral standards that are real then they apply in all cases. If you don't, then it is simple hypocrisy.&quot;</font></p><p align="CENTER">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
