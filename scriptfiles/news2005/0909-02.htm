<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->CHICAGO - September 9 - Farm Sanctuary, the  nation's leading farm animal shelter and advocacy organization,  today announced the release of a Zogby International poll that  reveals a vast majority, 79 percent, of likely voters in Illinois  agree that foie gras production should be banned in the state. At  the Chicago City Hall on Tuesday, September 13 at 9 a.m. the  Board of Alderman and State legislators will discuss concerns  about the cruelty of fois gras production and whether to ban the  sale of foie gras in Chicago.
<p>   Alderman Joe Moore introduced the proposal to ban the sale of  foie gras in Chicago. Earlier this year, Senator Kate Wojcik  introduced a bill to ban the production of foie gras in Illinois.  Senate Bill 413 (SB 413), passed the State Senate unanimously  (53-0), and is currently under consideration in the House. </p>
<p>   Alderman Joe Moore had this to say regarding his proposed ban  on the sale of foie gras, "The practice involved in the  production of foie gras does not fall in line with the values of  the vast majority of residents within Chicago.  Our city can play  a major role in the nationwide effort to ban the production and  sale of a product that should have been banned from our store  shelves and restaurants years ago."</p>
<p>   Gene Bauston, president of Farm Sanctuary added, "Allowing the  cruel practice of force feeding birds to produce foie gras falls  outside the bounds of acceptable conduct in a society that values  compassion. The people have spoken - they want foie gras off the  menu."</p>
<p>   Outside of the U.S., foie gras production is banned in at  least a dozen European countries, as well as Israel, once the  world's third-largest producer of the product. Massachusetts has  similar pending legislation this year, and is holding a hearing  on Monday, September 12 in Boston.  Foie gras, a French term  meaning "fatty liver," is the enlarged, diseased liver of ducks  or geese that are force fed as a pipe is shoved down their  throats several times daily. These birds are forced to ingest  amounts of food far in excess of what they would eat in the wild.   In a matter of weeks, their livers expand up to ten times their  normal size until they reach the diseased state of "hepatic  lipidosis," in which they no longer function properly. It is this  diseased, fatty mass that is sold as foie gras. </p>
<p>   Additional results of the Zogby International poll of likely  Illinois voters included 84 percent agreeing that it is important  that animals raised on farms be treated humanely.  In addition,  four out of five Illinois residents agree that animals raised on  farms should be protected under the state's anti-cruelty laws.   Currently, farm animals are exempt from most state anti-cruelty  laws.</p>
