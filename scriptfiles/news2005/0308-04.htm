IFAW confirmed that in only a matter of days up to 319,500 baby seals are to be inhumanely killed for their fur. Canada's annual seal hunt is the largest marine mammal hunt in the world. The current three-year kill quota of almost one million seals is now in its final year.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">IFAW is calling on the Canadian government to stop completely the cruel, inhumane and ecologically unsustainable seal hunt. IFAW is the only organization in the world to consistently observe and document the hunt each year. For the last 36 years IFAW has brought media and government officials from around the world to view the hunt firsthand. This year, European parliamentarians and media from around the globe are observing the hunt with IFAW's help.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The international community, including over two million IFAW supporters is appalled by the cruelty of Cananda's hunt for baby seals. In opposition, Italy, Belgium and the Netherlands are creating legislation to ban seal products and the U.S. and the European Council are creating resolutions condemning the hunt. In the U.S. seals and other marine mammals have been protected from hunting since 1972 under the Marine Mammal Protection Act. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">About IFAW (International Fund for Animal Welfare) IFAW was founded in 1969 to end the Canadian baby seal hunt. Over the next two decades, IFAW won many hard fought victories for seals, including the 1982 European Union ban of whitecoat and blueback sealskins. These aggregate victories almost stopped the baby seal hunt in the 1980s. Three years ago the seal hunt returned to levels unseen in decades and it is bigger than ever.
