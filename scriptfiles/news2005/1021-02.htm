<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p>WASHINGTON - October 21- Amnesty International USA (AIUSA) members, staff and activists from throughout the Mid- Atlantic region will tackle some of the most urgent human rights issues in the world today when they convene for the organization's 2005 Mid-Atlantic Regional Conference in Philadelphia. More than 300 are expected to attend the event, which will take place at the Crowne Plaza Center City, 1800 Market Street, from Oct. 21 to 23. The public is welcome to attend; registration is $30 for the weekend, $25 for students/seniors/low income, and a Friday night screening of a human rights movie, also at the Crowne Plaza, is free.

<p>In exploring the theme "We the People: Taking a Stand for Human Rights," the organization will address such issues as the death penalty, violence against women, and economic, social and cultural rights. The conference's central topic, human rights violations in the U.S.-led "war on terror," gains special resonance in Philadelphia, the birthplace of the Constitution.

<p>"Many of the rights set forth by our Founding Fathers here in Philadelphia more than 200 years ago are now being threatened in the name of security," said Mary Shaw, AIUSA Philadelphia Area Coordinator. "This conference is a great opportunity for Amnesty members and the public at large to learn more about the issues and how they can take action to restore our rights here at home and defend freedom and human rights throughout the world."

<p>AIUSA Executive Director Dr. William F. Schulz, author of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1560254890/commondreams-20/ref=nosim/" target="_new"><i>Tainted Legacy: 9/11 and the Ruin of Human Rights</i></a>, said, "Some of our leaders have exploited the current climate of fear to excuse policies that curtail human rights. We're here to proclaim that human rights aren't dispensable. Protecting them is a cherished and admired American principle, and an essential part of the struggle to stop terrorism."

<p>AIUSA is honored to present The New Yorker's Seymour Hersh, one of the most acclaimed investigative reporters of the past 35 years, with a special focus on the abuse of power in the name of national security. Hersh, who broke the story of U.S. torture at Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq in May 2004, will speak at the closing plenary on Sunday, 12:40 to 2 p.m. He will be joined by Clive Stafford Smith, the British human rights lawyer and anti-death penalty activist who represents a number of inmates held at Guantanamo Bay.

<p>The conference will begin on Friday with a 7 p.m. screening of <i><a href="http://www.lestweforgetmovie.com/" target="_new">Lest We Forget</a></i>, Jason DaSilva's documentary illustrating the parallels between the experiences of the Arab and Muslim population in post-9/11 America and those of Japanese Americans during the Second World War. The film investigates how domestic security measures can cross the line into unjust treatment of innocent people.

<p>Dr. Schulz and Donna Newman, attorney for Jose Padilla -- the only American civilian ever arrested on U.S. soil and held by the military without a charge, a court hearing, or access to his lawyer -- will speak at the conference's opening plenary on Saturday, 9 to 10:20 a.m.

<p>Also of note are two panel discussions:

<p>"Taking a Stand for Life, Liberty, and Security of Person," Saturday, 3:30-4:50 p.m., featuring Susan Burke, leader of a litigation team representing the victims of abuse during the interrogations at Abu Ghraib, Dalia Hashad, who works for the American Civil Liberties Union in its Campaign Against Racial Profiling and focuses on issues facing Arab, Muslim, and South Asian Americans in the wake of post-9/11 backlash, and Jennifer Harbury, a Harvard-educated lawyer whose three-year quest to find her Guatemalan husband revealed high-level involvement between the CIA and the Guatemalan military in his capture, torture and murder.

<p>"Taking a Stand to Stop Violence Against Women," Sunday, 9 to 10:20 a.m., featuring Canan Arin, a practicing attorney in Istanbul, Turkey, and specialist on combating violence against women and girls, and Farida Ghulam Ismail of the Ministry of Education in Bahrain, who researches and advocates for the political empowerment of women.

<p>Saturday and Sunday workshops will include:

<p>"Onwards to Abolition! AIUSA's Work to End the Death Penalty"

<p>"Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights: Human Needs, Human Rights"

<p>"Discrimination Kills: Human Rights Abuses against Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender (LGBT) People"
