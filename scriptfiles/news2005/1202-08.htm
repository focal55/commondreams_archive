<p>WASHINGTON - December 2 - In light of former  Congressman Randy &quot;Duke&quot; Cunningham's plea to two felony counts this  past week, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington  (CREW) sent a letter to Congressman David Dreier (R-Calif.),  Chairman of the House Rules Committee, asking that he introduce  legislation revoking the pensions of Members of Congress convicted  of felonies.</p>
<p>   Currently Mr. Cunningham is entitled to keep his government  pension, regardless of the crimes he committed as an elected  official.</p>

<p>   &quot;A Member of Congress who betrays the public trust by breaking  the very laws he swears to uphold should not be permitted to keep  the hard earned money of American taxpayers,&quot; Melanie Sloan,  executive director of CREW, said today. &quot;Congressional felons do not  belong on the public dole.&quot;</p>
<p>   Any legislation regarding the revocation of Members' pensions  would be referred to the House Administration Committee, which is  chaired by Rep. Bob Ney (R-Ohio). Unfortunately, Rep. Ney is the  target of an ongoing Department of Justice bribery investigation and  may himself ultimately be convicted of a felony. Given these  circumstances, Rep. Ney would be unlikely to move such legislation. </p>
<p>   Similar legislation has been introduced in the past. In 2002,  when former Rep. James Traficant (D-Ohio) was convicted of fraud and  bribery, Reps. Jeff Miller (R-Fla.) and Ginny Brown-Waite (D-Fla.)  introduced a bill to prevent lawmakers from collecting a pension if  convicted of a crime involving their duties or after being expelled  from Congress.</p>
<p>   &quot;We strongly urge Rep. Dreier to introduce this bill and the  House to act on it quickly to reassure the public that the House  will not tolerate illegal conduct on the part of its Members.&quot; Sloan continued, &quot;Members of both parties need to start acting to restore  integrity to the House of Representatives. This legislation would be  a step in the right direction.&quot;</p>

<p>   The letter to Congressman Dreier is available at <a href="http://www.citizensforethics.org">http://www.citizensforethics.org</a>.</p>
