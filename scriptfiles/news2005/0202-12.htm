<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- February 2 -- ACORN's President, Maude Hurd, stated emphatically today that the community group will continue its campaign to pressure Liberty Tax to change its business practices, despite legal threats from the company.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;It is Liberty Tax that needs to cease and desist. They are the ones doing damage to people in low-and-moderate income families with their excessive tax preparation fees,&quot; Hurd said.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">After ACORN members protested at Liberty Tax offices in the U.S. and Canada this week, Liberty sent a &quot;Cease and Desist letter&quot; to the organization's offices, threatening to take legal action against the grassroots organization.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;I think their threats will get people even more fired up,&quot; said Hurd. &quot;Our peaceful, public actions have one purpose: to get Liberty Tax to sit down to talk to us about changing this industry, so more money stays in the low and moderate income communities that need it. Jackson Hewitt and H&amp;R Block have already done so -- why should Liberty be different?&quot;</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For over a year, ACORN has been waging a campaign against the high cost of Refund Anticipation Loans (RAL's), which are short- term loans secured by the recipient's tax refund. With these loans, customers are charged extraordinarily high interest rates to get their own tax dollars back, just a week or so faster than they otherwise would.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In January, the group announced a partnership with H&amp;R Block, in which the largest tax preparer in the country eliminated the administrative fee it charged to RAL customers and improved the disclosures it gives to customers, in order to offer them the lowest cost option first. ACORN also recently announced that Jackson Hewitt, the nation's second largest tax-preparer, had responded to the group's actions by entering into serious negotiations to change its practices related to RAL's.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>ACORN is the nation's largest community organization of low- and moderate-income families, with over 175,000 member families organized into 800 neighborhood chapters in 80 cities across the country. Since 1970 ACORN has taken action and won victories on issues of concern to their members. Their priorities include: better housing for first time homebuyers and tenants, living wages for low-wage workers, more investment in our communities from banks and governments, and better public schools. ACORN achieves these goals by building community organizations that have the power to win changes -- through direct action, negotiation, legislation, and voter participation. ACORN is an acronym, and each letter should be capitalized. ACORN stands for the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now. </i></font></p><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
