<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -- March 11 --  Common Cause supports efforts by Rep. Alan Mollohan (D-WV) to reverse partisan changes to ethics rules forced on the House at the start of the 109th Congress that would essentially shut down the ethics process.</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We applaud the refusal Thursday by Mollohan and other Democrats on the Ethics Committee to formally adopt the ethics changes that Republican leaders pushed through on Jan. 4 as part of a larger rules package. The rules were changed despite concerns expressed by former Ethics Committee Chairman Joel Hefley (R-CO) that ethics reform &quot;must be bipartisan and this is not bipartisan.&quot;</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Common Cause calls on Congress to adopt a resolution proposed by Mollohan that would rescind the ethics rules changes, including the most damaging one that would effectively dismiss a complaint in the event of a deadlock within the ethics committee, which is equally divided between Democrats and Republicans. If reforms are to be made to the House ethics process, they must be considered individually, in a bipartisan manner, not pushed through by leadership as part of a larger package.</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">And Congress must act fast. House Majority Leader Tom DeLay (R-TX), who was admonished three times last year by the Ethics Committee, is again facing serious ethics allegations, along with several other members of Congress and staff, that must be addressed. In fact, one of the charges -- that DeLay broke House rules by accepting an expense paid trip to South Korea from a foreign agent - prompted Jan Baran, former general counsel to the Republican National Committee, to acknowledge to The Washington Post that the trip is &quot;a problem&quot; and will likely trigger an investigation by the Ethics Committee.</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The Ethics Committee must investigate the allegations that have been raised recently regarding travel expenses and Democratic and Republican members of Congress and staff,&quot; said Common Cause President Chellie Pingree. &quot;But before that can happen, the process must be fixed. If left as is, with a rule requiring that at least one member of the Ethics Committee break rank with his or her political party in order for an investigation to begin, it is highly doubtful that a single ethics complaint will ever be investigated.&quot;</font></p><p> </p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As the majority party that runs the House, it falls to Republicans to correct this problem and roll back the unacceptable rules changes. One way to do this is to support Mollohan's resolution.</font></p><p align="CENTER">###</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
