WASHINGTON, May 11 -- Four years ago this week, President George W. Bush began showing his contempt for the advice and consent process when he named his first 11 nominees to lifetime positions on the federal bench - a majority of whom were out of the mainstream and had a record of failing to protect the rights of ordinary Americans. "Four years later, President Bush and the Senate leadership continue to push forward two women who have long records of trying to roll back civil rights, worker's rights, women's rights and consumer and environmental protections," said Alliance for Justice President Nan Aron.

</font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Renominating these two judges is a slap in the face of American women," said NARAL Pro-Choice America President Nancy Keenan. "Priscilla Owen and Janice Rogers Brown are both so insistent on pursuing their personal agenda that even their conservative colleagues on the bench have criticized them for their judicial activism. But the Bush Administration cynically believes that because they are women, groups that stand up for women's rights will be silenced. If President Bush wants to mute our opposition, there's only one way to do it - withdraw these nominees and replace them with judges who will protect a woman's right to choose."

</font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Justice Owen, in every reported case to come before her prior to her nomination to the federal bench, voted against permitting a minor to obtain an abortion without notifying her parents, often ignoring the exceptions allowed in Texas' Parental Notification Act. She has gone as far as attempting to require a minor to be informed about philosophical, moral, social and religious issues in order to prove that she was sufficiently well informed to have an abortion without parental notification, despite the fact that the law did not have such requirements. Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, then serving as a justice on the Texas Supreme Court, called Owen's attempt to re-write the state's parental notification law an "unconscionable act of judicial activism."

</font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Justice Brown, in a California case that required the Catholic Charities of Sacramento to provide coverage for prescription contraceptives for its employees under a state law that was enacted to eliminate gender discrimination in health care benefits, wrote the sole dissent. She even suggested that the solution for those few requiring prescription contraceptive coverage would be to simply find a new job, writing, "Of the women of childbearing age who remain, and to whom contraceptive coverage is a critical concern, none are faced with a pervasive practice which would prevent them from finding more congenial employment."

</font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Throughout the week, women leaders from Alliance for Justice member organizations will release statements detailing the detrimental impact these appointments would have on individual rights and protections.</font></p><p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">###</font></p><!-- #EndEditable -->
