        Israel's High Court has narrowly upheld a law denying Palestinians from the West Bank and Gaza married to Israeli citizens the right to live in the country with their spouses. 
<p>
  The judges voted by six to five not to cancel a four-year-old amendment to 
  the Citizenship Law which outlaws "family unification" in Israel 
  between Palestinians and Arab citizens of Israel.
</p>
<p>
  It was passed as a one-year emergency measure in 2002 on the ground that it 
  was needed to protect Israeli security. But the amendment, described 
  yesterday by the Knesset member Ran Cohen, of the left-wing Meretz party, as 
  "rooted in racism", has been renewed every year since then.
</p>
<p>
  Israel's Chief Justice, Aharon Barak, sided with the minority on the bench, 
  declaring: "This violation of rights is directed against Arab citizens 
  of Israel. As a result, therefore, the law is a violation of the right of 
  Arab citizens in Israel to equality."

</p>
<p>
  Muad el-Sana, an Israeli Arab lawyer who is married to a Palestinian woman 
  from the West Bank town of Bethlehem and works for Adalah, one of the 
  agencies bringing the case, declared: "This is a very black day for the 
  state of Israel and also a black day for my family and for the other 
  families who are suffering like us. The government is preventing people from 
  conducting a normal family life just because of their nationality."
</p>
<p>
  Wile the court had granted el-Sana's wife, Abir, a university lecturer, a 
  temporary injunction preventing her deportation, Mr el-Sana said the high 
  court's ruling would make it almost impossible for the couple and their two 
  children, aged 2 years and five months, to continue living together. Their 
  individual petition said that he has no right to live in Bethlehem and she 
  has no right to live with her husband in the Negev.
</p>
<p>
  Mohammed Barakeh, a prominent Arab Knesset member on Sunday said the ruling "
gives racism a shady alibi." He added: "The fact that the ruling was 
  opposed by several of the judges is a ray of light that does not illuminate 
  the darkness of the court's decision and the Knesset's legislation."
</p>
<p>
  Official figures show that of 22,000 applications for such reunification 
  since the Oslo accord in the mid 1990s only 6000 have been granted. Adalah 
  said yesterday that the state had said that it had interrogated only 25 of 
  these "for alleged involvement in terrorist activities" and that 
  the state anyway had ample capacity to carry out security checks during the 
  staged process towards legal status. Adalah said last night that in 1980, at 
  the height of apartheid, a South African court had refused to approve orders 
  similar to the present Israeli law "because they contradicted the right 
  to a family."
</p>

<p>
  Last year the then Interior Minister Ophir Pines-Paz slightly modified the 
  law by widening ministerial discretion to award legal status to Palestinian 
  spouses. Yesterday Haim Ramon, Israel's Justice Minister, indicated he would 
  be seeking to recast the law to apply equally to all ethnic groups but 
  warned that no country was obliged to admit citizens form an authority with 
  which it was in conflict. He added: "We have to remember that this law 
  was legislated during the Palestinian uprising, when several people who 
  received citizenship through family unification carried out attacks."
</p>
<p>
  The outgoing judge Michael Cheshin, who voted with the majority, said during 
  a debate in February: "The Palestinian Authority is an enemy 
  government, a government that wants to destroy the state and is not prepared 
  to recognize Israel... Why should we take chances during wartime? Did 
  England and America take chances with Germans seeking their destruction 
  during the Second World War? No one is preventing them from building a 
  family but they should live in Jenin instead of in [the Israeli Arab city 
  of] Umm al-Fahm."
</p>
<p>
  * The Israeli army said it had killed at least seven Palestinian militants 
  in the West Bank yesterday. One of the men killed was Elias Al Ashkar, 
  blamed for suicide attacks including the one in Tel Aviv on 17 April which 
  killed 11.
