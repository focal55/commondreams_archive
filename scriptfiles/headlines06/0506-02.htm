<p>WASHINGTON --
Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld tried to rewrite history this week when 
he denied making prewar claims that Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass 
destruction. 
<P>Rumsfeld's latest attempt at backtracking on his prewar rhetoric came 
Thursday in Atlanta, at a contentious public forum where he faced a handful of 
hecklers and a war protester in the audience, who charged that he had lied 
about Iraq having weapons of mass destruction  --  President Bush's top 
rationale for war. 
<P>The Pentagon chief denied that he lied, saying he had relied on official 
intelligence reports about Hussein's weapons. 
<P>His accuser persisted: "You said you knew where they were." 
<P>Rumsfeld shot back, "I did not. I said I knew where suspected sites were." 
<P>The record shows that in the weeks preceding the war, Rumsfeld flatly 
claimed to know the whereabouts of Hussein's weapons arsenal. On March 30, 2003 
--  11 days into the war  --  Rumsfeld was asked in an ABC News interview if 
he was surprised that American forces had not yet found any weapons of mass 
destruction. 

<P>"Not at all," he said, according to an official Pentagon transcript. "The 
area in the south and the west and the north that coalition forces control is 
substantial. It happens not to be the area where weapons of mass destruction 
were dispersed. We know where they are. They're in the area around Tikrit and 
Baghdad and east, west, south and north somewhat." 
<P>His comments in Atlanta were in line with an attempted revision six months 
after the war started. On Sept. 10, 2003, Rumsfeld addressed the issue in 
remarks at the National Press Club. "I said, 'We know they're in that area.' I 
should have said, 'I believe they're in that area. Our intelligence tells us 
they're in that area,' and that was our best judgment." 
<P>Six months before the invasion, on Sept. 19, 2002, Rumsfeld testified 
about Iraqi weapons of mass destruction before the Senate Armed Services 
Committee. Rumsfeld said Hussein "has amassed large clandestine stockpiles of 
biological weapons ... large, clandestine stockpiles of chemical weapons," 
according to the committee's transcript. 
<P>That theme continued right up to the weeks before the invasion. On Jan. 
20, 2003, Rumsfeld told an audience at the Reserve Officers Association that 
Hussein "has large, unaccounted-for stockpiles of chemical and biological 
weapons, including VX, sarin, mustard gas, anthrax, botulism and possibly 
smallpox." 
<P>At a Jan. 29, 2003, Pentagon news conference, Rumsfeld said that "the 
Iraqi regime has not accounted for some 38,000 liters of botulism toxin, 500 
tons of sarin, mustard gas, VX nerve agent, upwards of 30,000 munitions capable 
of delivering chemical weapons," along with mobile biological weapons labs. 
<P>After U.S. inspectors failed to locate any weapons of mass destruction 
seven months after the invasion, a reporter at a Pentagon news conference asked 
Rumsfeld: "In retrospect, were you a little too far-leaning in your statement 
that Iraq categorically had caches of weapons, of chemical and biological 
weapons, given what's been found to date? You painted a picture of extensive 
stocks of Iraqi mass-killing weapons." 
<P>"Wait," Rumsfeld interjected. "You go back and give me something that 
talks about extensive stocks. The U.N. reported extensive stocks. That is where 
that came from. I said what I believed to be the case, and I don't  --  I'd be 
surprised if you found the word 'extensive.' "
