<p>WASHINGTON - Three in four Americans want President George W. Bush to disclose his aides' links with disgraced lobbyist Jack Abramoff, a demand the White House has rejected so far, according to a poll published on Saturday.

<p>The Washington Post said the demand was supported by clear majorities of both Republicans and Democrats in the Washington Post-ABC News poll conducted between January 23 and January 26.

<p>Abramoff pleaded guilty to fraud charges this month and agreed to help U.S. prosecutors in a corruption probe that has sparked calls for reform of the Washington practice of lobbying lawmakers with donations and favors to influence legislation.

<p>At a White House news conference on Thursday, Bush said he did not know Abramoff and would not release photographs in which the two appeared together.

<p>He said the release of the photographs would be used for "pure political purposes" by Democrats.

<p>The Washington Post said 76 percent of those surveyed said Bush should release lists of all meetings between his aides and Abramoff. Eighteen percent disagreed.

<p>"Two in three Republicans joined with eight in 10 Democrats and political independents in favoring disclosure," the paper said.

<p>It said 1,002 people were interviewed and the poll's margin of error was plus or minus 3 percentage points.
