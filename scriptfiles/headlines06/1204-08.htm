<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p>Former President Jimmy Carter on Sunday said the only hope for peace in the Middle East is for America to take a more "balanced view" of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, something he believes may be politically impossible.</p>
<p>Carter, promoting his new book, "Palestine: Peace Not Apartheid," in a marathon, nationally broadcast interview on C-Span, said that, given widespread support for Israel in the United States, it would be "unimaginable" that a politician would assign any blame to Israel for the ongoing violence in the Middle East and still win office.</p><p>The result, Carter said, is an unbalanced U.S. foreign policy on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict that prevents America from acting as an honest broker between the two sides, as Carter did in reaching the Camp David Accords between Israel and Egypt in 1978.</p><p>The peace process, in fact, has been dormant for the six years of President Bush's tenure, Carter said. Bush is a staunch supporter of Israel and for years refused to talk with the Palestinians.</p><p>"There needs to be a two-state solution," Carter said during a three-hour live interview from his home in Plains.</p><p>That's essentially the case Carter makes in his 22nd book and in interviews and speeches he's been giving in a whirlwind national tour promoting the book as he sets the stage for a three-day event at the University of Georgia next month that will commemorate the 30th anniversary of his inauguration as America's 39th president.</p><p>That commemoration Jan. 19-21 will feature Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer and high-profile Carter administration officials, including former Vice President Walter Mondale and National Security Adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski.</p><p>Topics will include the Middle East, energy policy and Islamic fundamentalism.</p><p>Over the past couple of weeks, Carter has hit virtually every national broadcast and cable news outlet, and the outspoken former president has been greeted at each stop by skepticism if not outright hostility for what many see as an anti-Israel book.</p><p>"You're a racist and anti-Semite," one caller shouted at Carter during Sunday's broadcast before being cut off by the show's host.</p><p>"I reject that with enthusiasm," Carter said.</p><p>As controversial as Carter's book has been, even it could not stir enough enmity to fill three hours of questions from callers. (The show, on C-Span2's "Book TV," was 3 1/2 hours, though Carter wasn't on the whole time.)</p><p>Only a few of the people who called or sent questions via e-mail even mentioned the Middle East. Carter, now 82, spent much of the show talking on a range of issues, from energy policy to plans for his own funeral.</p><p>The former president said he wants to be buried in front of his home in Plains, though, as an ex-Navy man he's eligible for burial in Arlington National Cemetery near Washington.</p><p>His memorial service will be held in Washington, he said, though there'd be "a brief display of my body in Atlanta" before he's buried.</p><p>"I think about it," Carter said of death.</p><p>"But as a Christian I don't have any fear of it."
