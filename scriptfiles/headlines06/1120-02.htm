Living on their houseboat off the Marin County coast, anti-war activists 
Donna Sheehan and her partner, Paul Reffel, concocted a way for the world to 
communally create a lot of peaceful vibes. 
<P>They want everyone to have an orgasm on the same day.

On Dec. 22, they're asking the world to contribute to the <a href="http://www.globalorgasm.org" target="_new">Global Orgasm 
for Peace</a>. Sheehan said not to worry if you don't have a partner. 
<P>Busy multitaskers shouldn't despair about trying to cram this global 
activism into their busy schedules, either, she said. Take any time during the 
24-hour period at the beginning of the winter solstice to join the 
demonstration. Just make sure to think of peace before or after participating. 
<P>Once you've committed, there's even a secret sign to show others that you 
plan to take part: Flash the universal "OK" sign and wink. Or, as it has been 
redubbed, "The O" sign.  
<P>Reffel and Sheehan are not just tossing off this idea. They're pros at 
launching global peace demonstrations. In the run-up to the U.S. invasion of 
Iraq four years ago, Sheehan and a few dozen of her new best friends stripped 
naked and spelled out <a href="http://www.commondreams.org/headlines02/1117-02.htm">"Peace" on a Marin County field</a>. As photos of their naked 
activism spread, similar so-called Baring Witness demonstrations were 
replicated dozens of times from <a href="http://www.commondreams.org/headlines03/0208-06.htm">Australia</a> to the conservative nether regions of 
Utah.  
<P>Their activism was rearoused recently when they heard about two U.S. 
warships camped out around the Middle East, activity they fear portends war 
with Iran.  
<P>Having experienced the futility of petitioning international leaders 
through mass nudity before the Iraq war, the pair decided to ramp up their 
tactics.  

<P>While the Global O may sound much like other collective actions  attempted 
over the years, the O's organizers promise something more on <a href="http://www.globalorgasm.org" target="_new">their Web site</a>: 
"The combination of high-energy orgasmic energy combined with mindful intention 
may have a much greater effect than previous mass meditations and prayers." 
<P>Just pick a time. 
<P>"We wanted to make it during the cocktail hour," Sheehan said. "But since 
everybody is on a different time, then it would be harder for everybody to 
participate."  
<P>In a manner that could only be birthed in the fertile energy fields of the 
Bay Area, the Global O for Peace ties together activism, sexual identity, 
gender roles, the fledgling effort to measure global consciousness and the 
movement of battleships. The GOP  --  initials likely creating the only link to 
the Republican Party deep in liberal Marin County --  is about more than the 
latest anti-war tactic. 
<P>Personally, Sheehan's experiences with the Baring Witness demonstrations 
opened up new avenues of self-exploration for the 76-year-old artist. Since 
then, she has learned more about how women can initiate courtship, sex and 
peace, culminating this year in a book she and Reffel wrote, "Redefining 
Seduction."  
<P>Not surprisingly, the Global O isn't the first effort to synchronize 
pleasure in the name of peace. Or even just in the name of synchronized 
pleasure. For several years, a weekly climax has been coordinated online 
(Webcams optional), and sexuality experts say there have been several other 
attempts to link pleasure and peace.  
<P>"Yes, the vast majority of global orgasm coordinations have been firmly 
rooted in San Francisco," said Carol Queen, the staff sexologist at San 
Francisco's Good Vibrations store and a nationally recognized expert on 
sexuality. "It is natural to link pleasure and peace. If you're experiencing 
pleasure, you're not engaging in aggressive, destructive behavior. " 
<P>Not all such efforts have been successful. Queen's partner, Robert 
Lawrence, who is president of the Center for Sex and Culture, remembers 
participating in synchronized pleasure-for-peace demonstrations in the early 
1990s. 
<P>The results? 
<P>"Shortly thereafter, I left my partner at the time," Lawrence said. "It 
wasn't exactly the peace I was looking for."  
<P>Queen said the orgasm-challenged shouldn't be discouraged from 
participating Dec. 22. In fact, knowing their efforts are going toward creating 
world peace "might actually relieve some of the anxiety they feel around their 
sexuality that leads to problems in that area." 
<P>While Queen plans to set aside "20 minutes to two hours" for her Dec. 22 
demonstration, her partner, Lawrence, is not.  
<P>"I think I've got a meeting that day," Lawrence said. "I'm really busy." 
<P>But you've got 24 hours to participate.  
<P>"Oh, all right," Lawrence said. "I think I can work it in, then."  
<P>While this is one anti-war demonstration sure to leave its participants 
smiling, measuring its global impact might be more problematic.  
<P>What's troubling some activists is that the carrier Eisenhower has pulled 
into the Arabian Sea to replace the Enterprise, which was scheduled to return 
to Virginia on Saturday, according to a Navy spokesman. The Boxer Expeditionary 
Strike Force, warships loaded with Marines and their battle equipment, is in 
the Persian Gulf now.  

<P>Getting them to turn around will be challenging.  
<P>Pentagon spokesman Air Force Maj. Dave Smith said he has never heard of 
coordinated global energy affecting the battleship movements before. 
<P>"But I've only been here since June," Smith said. "I've been told that 
there are no absolutes about anything." 
<P>Would that preclude his plans to participate in the Dec. 22 demonstration? 
<P>"I'm not going to answer that one," Smith said.  
<P>No matter how many people participate, don't look for any increased 
seismic activity to show up on the Richter scale.  
<P>"The filters we have screen out any man-made activity, like a truck 
rolling past, or uh, the activity you described," said U.S. Geological Survey 
spokeswoman Stephanie Hanna. 
<P>So when somebody says, "Baby, you just made the earth move," that's just 
hyperbole, huh? 
<P>"I guess reality is whatever you perceive it to be," said Hanna, speaking 
seismically. She was equally vague on her Dec. 22 plans. 
<P>"This is the first I've heard of it," Hanna said. "It sounds like, uh, an 
interesting idea." 
<P>Perhaps the only way to measure its effect will be through the New 
Jersey-based Global Consciousness Project. Run by volunteers who monitor a 
network of dozens of random number generators around the world, the project 
looks for any correlation between the numbers produced and significant, shared 
events like elections, terrorist attacks or New Year's Eves that could signal 
the existence of some sort of global consciousness.
<P>Project director Roger Nelson said he will look for any data blips around 
Dec. 22 if the Global O Project becomes a significant worldwide event. 
Regardless, Nelson has no qualms about potentially corrupting his data by 
taking part in a little global activism.  
<P>"If luck befalls me," Nelson said. "Who knows?" 
<P>Even skeptics like Jim Underdown, who investigates paranormal matters in 
California for the Center for Inquiry-West, plans to join in the fun  --  even 
if he believes there is no way to transmit energy from one's brain to achieve a 
physical result.  
<P>"You don't need a good reason to have an orgasm," he said. "Even a stupid 
one is OK."
