<p>Sometime this afternoon, Jocelyn Hurndall will pick up the phone to Israel. For an hour or so, the mother-of-two will receive her final briefing into the topic that has dominated her life for the past three years: who was behind the order to shoot her son.

Tomorrow the quietly spoken former teacher will be the first witness at the high-profile inquest into the death of Tom Hurndall, 22, the British student shot in the head as he shepherded Palestinian children to safety.
<p>Beneath the gaze of the world's media, Jocelyn will tell coroner Andrew Reid, at St Pancras Coroners' Court, how the Israeli authorities tampered with evidence, suppressed investigations and attempted to cover up the shooting.
<p>For Jocelyn, it offers a chance to try to explain an unprovoked killing which has been condemned by the international community. For the Israeli authorities, damaging headlines lie ahead, as its army's chain of command is dragged into the controversy surrounding the killing, among them senior officers wanted by British authorities for war crimes.
<p>Reid may be forgiven for experiencing a sense of deja vu as Jocelyn delivers her testimony. Only last week, the Central London Coroner contemplated strikingly similar allegations into the death of James Miller, a British cameraman who was shot dead a month after Tom, in the same Gaza Strip refugee camp, by a soldier from the same Israeli Defence Force battalion.
<p>Miller's inquest heard how Israeli authorities tried to block British attempts to investigate the murder and heard allegations that Israeli authorities covered up the precise circumstances of how the award-winning 34-year-old was shot while waving a white flag.
<p>What did not emerge during Miller's inquest was how the Israeli authorities offered &pound;200,000 'blood money' to Miller's widow, Sophy, to settle her case for compensation in the weeks running up to the inquest. Sophy received the offer in January and was encouraged by the British embassy in Israel to accept the deal. The Miller family rejected the offer as an insult, having already invested more in a quest to bring those responsible to justice.
<p>'A mother has her husband shot and has to raise children for the rest of her life, and is told that the amount offered is limited because the Israelis believed that, by offering any more, they would set a precedent,' said James's brother, John, yesterday. The Hurndalls have also experienced Israeli intransigence on financial matters: the Israelis provided a cheque to cover the cost of repatriating Tom's comatose body to a London hospital after he was shot - but it bounced.
<p>This week's inquest will be heard against a backdrop of hostility between British and Israeli authorities that have resulted from the two deaths. So brittle are relations that the IDF has refused to send a representative to the hearing.
<p>Jocelyn Hurndall will place the blame for her son's death not on a single sniper, but on the entire 'pyramid of authority'. She wants to see a case brought against senior IDF officers whom British lawyers want to prosecute under war crime legislation relating to attacks on Palestinian civilians and property.
<p>Among them is retired major-general Doron Almog, who may also have been part of the chain of command responsible for overseeing Rafah, the Gaza Strip town where Tom Hurndall was shot. Last September, a warrant was issued for Almog's arrest as he touched down at Heathrow on a visit to Britain. Israeli diplomats warned him not to leave the plane.
<p>Amid mounting worldwide opprobrium over the two shootings, the diplomatic fallout is likely to worsen this week, when the Attorney-General receives the evidence gathered by the Israelis into the shooting of Miller. Lord Goldsmith, who is said to have a sharp interest in the case, knows that history will be made if there are evidential reasons for him to request the extradition of Miller's killer from Israel. Goldsmith will meet Miller's family this month to reveal his decision.
<p>Jocelyn spent yesterday afternoon flicking through Tom's journals. Although he was barely into his twenties when he was killed, Tom had maintained a meticulous archive of thoughts and poetry for the previous decade. His parents plan to publish their son's work soon; it comprises countless emails and letters in Tom's spidery longhand that reveal an observant young man who had travelled to Rafah to form an opinion unsullied by propaganda. Speaking from her north London home yesterday, Jocelyn said: 'Tom had an innate necessity to write. As times goes by, the more I am struck by his maturity. His keenness to observe. We are lucky that he managed to leave so many thoughts behind.
<p>'He was a remarkable person, with a wonderful nature and a quite incredible thirst to learn about the world. He would have wanted justice if this had happened to anybody else. We will never give up until that justice is secured.'
<p>Just before midday on 11 April, 2003, an Israeli sniper opened fire on three children as they played in a dusty, makeshift playground in Rafah, deep in the fag end of the Gaza Strip. The youngsters froze. A young English photographer dashed to the scene, carrying the traumatised body of a small boy to safety.
<p>Hurndall returned into the line of fire. As he bent to scoop a small girl away from the fizzing bullets, a bullet thudded into the side of his head. Hurndall spent the next nine months in a London hospital. He never regained consciousness.
<p>There is a particular reference in his journals, among the thousands of words he wrote wherever he went, that seems peculiarly prescient. His words reveal a young man keenly aware of the dangers ahead, indeed of his possible fate.
<p>'Will be there [Rafah] for a few weeks until money runs out or I am shot,' he wrote days before he was indeed shot. Other missives portray a man who had prided himself on the objectivity of his opinions, the belief that only the truly impartial hold views worth sharing. Emails show that Hurndall arrived in Rafah after hearing of the death of American peacekeeper Rachel Corrie. He wanted to know what had really happened, Could it really be that bad?
<p>Rachel was a member of the International Solidarity Movement (ISM), a gathering of young idealists who offer themselves as human shields. Three weeks before Tom was shot, the 23-year-old had watched a bulldozer rumble towards Palestinian homes that the IDF wanted to flatten. She stood her ground. The bulldozer, it is alleged, crushed her, stopped, then reversed over her broken frame. Photographs show ISM activists huddled around a crushed body. In the background stands the massive shape of a bulldozer. Connecting the two are deep bulldozer tracks. The field report by the IDF, in keeping with the controversial accounts furnished by their inquiries into the death of James and Tom, state that Rachel was 'not run over by an engineering vehicle'.
<p>For the two British families, the investigations have served only to highlight the shooting of Palestinian children in places like Rafah. By the time of Tom's shooting, 270 civilians had been killed in its crumbling streets since the start of the intifada.
<p>There are very few investigations into the cases. The first Israeli soldier to be convicted of manslaughter in a combat zone was the sergeant who was jailed for eight years last April after being found guilty of shooting Tom.
<p>'A large percentage of them were women or children, ordinary people going about their business,' said Anthony Hurndall, Tom's father. He now hopes that, if anything positive can emerge from his son's death, it is the highlighting of what he describes as the targeting of innocent civilians with 'impunity'. Anthony believes that the sniper convicted of manslaughter for shooting Tom, Sergeant Wahid Taysir, was simply doing what his senior officers expected of him.
<p>'Taysir was doing what his superiors told him to do, that is why he is so angry,' said Anthony. The City of London property lawyer remains confident that senior Israeli officers will be brought to account after the evidence that is likely to be aired before the coroner this week.
<p>It was Anthony Hurndall's perseverance that finally led to the tracking down of 13 witnesses who contradicted the IDF's official report into how his son was shot. His own report destroyed the validity of IDF claims that Tom was firing a gun at Israelis, or wearing combat fatigues. Images taken moments after the shooting, when blood was still spurting from his brain, also revealed that Tom had been shot hundreds of yards from where the Israeli army had alleged. Such findings will be corroborated this week by testimony from ballistics experts, Met officers and pathologists' reports.
<p>Anthony said: 'We were told right away that it was very unlikely we would get the truth. They said CCTV cameras were non-existent, then they said they were facing the other way, then they said that they could not see where Tom was shot. It was all wrong.'
<p>It is not only the manner of their death that John and Tom have in common: both hailed from families proud to see their children travel the world and answer life's questions for themselves. Even now, their families talk of the vigour of youth; the importance of discovering their own truths.
<p>For both families, this month's inquests will also precipitate a change of gear in their quest for justice. For the Miller family, the quiet dignified approach that they have hereto assumed may soon be a thing of the past. Even as the Foreign Office announced last Friday that the minister, Kim Howells, was looking to arrange a meeting with the family, the Millers told The Observer that they never wanted to see Howells again.
<p>'He sat down with my mother, father and Sophy, and promised to do all he could. But that was it. Nothing. He wouldn't even return our calls. We have been praised for our dignified approach, but that may be over,' John said yesterday.
<p>When last Thursday's inquest jury returned its verdict that James was murdered, Miller felt elation, then a burning fury.
<p>'In a strange way, the vindication hurts; you feel more determined than ever.' Another British family who lost a son in the streets of Rafah may experience a similar sensation this week.
<p><b>In his own words</b>
<p><b>5 April 2003 8:07am </b><br>Email on route to Rafah
<p>Palestine is seriously messing with my head. I need someone I can trust who knows something about the situation who can help me sift through all the shit. This is my first time doing this and it's really getting hard to be objective, plus some of the stuff I've been seeing is pretty heavy and it's just making me lose it. It's like being undercover and I am watching myself slipping into a role when aIl I want to be is as detached as possible. There we go, that wasn't so bad as always. Love you all, stay safe, Tom.
<p><b>7 April 2003, 8:37am </b><br>Email one day after arrival
<p>It's around 23 hours since I arrived [in Rafah]. In the last two hours I have been shot at, shelled, tear-gassed, hit by falling brick plaster, sound-bombed, almost run over by a moving house called a D10 bulldozer, chased by soldiers and else besides. On the downside, I didn't get a good night's sleep because of the machine gunfire.
<p><b>9 April 2003 </b><br>Written two days before he was shot
<p>My second night and things seem 'easier'. Indoors now, but no further from danger. To begin with, there is an Israeli tank less than 20 metres from my bed, that was parked there two weeks ago and has only left to be replaced each morning. The room next to mine has several large caliber [sic] bullet-holes in each wall, many of them having travelled through the brick.
