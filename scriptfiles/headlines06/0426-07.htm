A federal judge Tuesday rebuffed the U.S. government's
initial attempt to file a secret declaration in an Oregon
lawsuit challenging the legality of the National Security
Agency's warrantless surveillance program. 
<P>"At this point, the government -- in my view -- has
not made a case that it cannot furnish public information
that would support its position," U.S. District Judge
Garr M. King said in a closed telephone conference call with
attorneys. </P>
<P>King gave federal officials until May 12 to provide a better
argument. King said he might still consider looking at the
secret filing in the future, but he is one of the few judges
across the country to challenge government attempts to
discuss national security issues out of the presence of
opposing attorneys. </P>
<P>"To the extent it can be done without compromising
national security interests, a litigant has a right to know
the legal and factual positions being taken by the
government so they can respond to them," King said,
according to an audio transcript of the conference call. </P>
<P>"I believe the court should avoid, if possible,
receiving secret declarations from one side and basing
decisions on facts or arguments not disclosed to the other
side," King said. </P>
<P>The lawsuit at issue was filed in late February by
Al-Haramain, an Ashland-based Islamic charity, and two of
its attorneys. The suit claims that federal officials
illegally intercepted telephone calls between Soliman
al-Buthe, an Al-Haramain director, and two attorneys based
in Washington, D.C. </P>
<P>Since The New York Times revealed the NSA's warrantless
wiretapping program in December, several civil suits have
been filed challenging the legality of the program. In
addition, lawyers in a half dozen criminal cases have asked
for evidence obtained by warrantless wiretapping. </P>
<P>Government officials have responded by filing secret
responses not available to opposing counsel or the public.
Judges have generally ruled in favor of the government
without explaining why. </P>

<P>In the Al-Haramain case, lawyers for the charity filed a
classified document under seal that they say supports their
claim that the government illegally intercepted phone calls. </P>
<P>In March, The Oregonian filed a motion seeking to unseal the
classified document in order to expose possible illegal
conduct by government officials. </P>
<P>In a public response, the government admitted that the
classified document was inadvertently turned over to a
lawyer for Al-Haramain in August 2004. But government
officials said the public had no right to classified
information. </P>
<P>"Any disclosure of that document would be of grave
injury to national security," Andrea Marie Gacki, an
attorney with the U.S. Department of Justice, said during
Tuesday's conference call. </P>
<P>But in legal papers, Al-Haramain lawyers questioned how much
of a threat to national security the document really is. The
FBI didn't attempt to retrieve it for two months after
it was inadvertently released. And if the document was so
crucial that it must now be kept in a secure facility, how
did it end up in a stack of documents that was disclosed to
Al-Haramain lawyers? </P>
<P>"Where is the grave threat to national security?"
Steven Goldberg, a Portland attorney representing
Al-Haramain, asked during the conference call. </P>
<P>King said he would consider those questions when deciding
whether to unseal the document. </P>
<P>"These facts could cause the court to question the
conclusory statements regarding the classification and
national security effect," he said. </P>
<P>In addition to their public filing, government lawyers filed
a secret declaration to the judge to explain what is in the
classified document. </P>

<P>"We felt it was necessary to describe to you the nature
of the document and what it reveals," said Anthony J.
Coppolino, a U.S. Justice Department lawyer. "If you
were to review this declaration, for instance, you would
already have begun to understand some details regarding our
position." </P>
<P>Coppolino argued that King clearly had authority to review
secret filings by the government to protect national
security. </P>
<P>But Goldberg argued against the judge reviewing documents
that the plaintiffs do not have access to. </P>
<P>"There is a difference between allowing documents into
the public record and not allowing plaintiffs'
attorneys access to those documents," he said. </P>
<P>The court has other options rather than reviewing government
filings in secret. The court can issue protective orders to
keep documents from general public view. And attorneys for
the plaintiffs can get security clearances. </P>
<P>"The court really needs to send the government a clear
message that the issues in the case will not be litigated in
secret," Goldberg said. </P>
<P>While leaving his options open, King said he wanted to see
more details in public, including general descriptions,
before he would consider reviewing documents not available
to opposing lawyers. </P>
<P>But, he added, "I understand that in issues involving
national security that may be necessary." </P>
