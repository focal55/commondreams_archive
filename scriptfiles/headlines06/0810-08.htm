        <p> A draft UN ceasefire resolution on Lebanon was unravelling last night as the two co-sponsors, France and the United States, bickered over several key provisions, notably the timing of an Israeli withdrawal. </p>

        
          
          
            <p>
  Dramatising the difficulties, the French President, Jacques Chirac, publicly 
  warned the US against allowing the initiative to fail, suggesting it would 
  be "immoral". Ominously, he said that in such a circumstance 
  France would table a resolution on its own. British diplomats expressed 
  frustration with France, which would be expected to lead a multinational 
  force in southern Lebanon. The Foreign minister, Kim Howells, said: "
  What we need is a bit more diplomatic work, , and a bit less posturing."
</p>
<p>
  As an old rift between France and the US threatened to reopen, other 
  diplomats suggested that France misled the US over the level of Lebanese 
  support for the draft resolution. 
</p>
<p>
  The two countries first tabled a draft ceasefire text last weekend, but then 
  found themselves at odds when the Lebanese government, backed by the Arab 
  League, complained that it was unfairly tilted towards Israel.

</p>
<p>
  "Part of the resolution is unravelling, it's deeply frustrating," 
  one diplomat said. 
</p>
<p>
  A breakdown of the talks could seriously delay any ceasefire resolution 
  emerging and prolong the fighting. It would also represent a crushing blow 
  to the UN's credibility at a time of deep crisis in the Middle East.
</p>
<p>
  No one at the UN last night seemed able to predict how quickly the French 
  and the Americans would agree, or if they would at all. Further complicating 
  diplomacy in New York yesterday was the agreement by the Israeli cabinet to 
  push deeper into Lebanon, even though it may put off starting the new 
  advance for three days, ostensibly to allow time for the UN talks. 
</p>
<p>
  "If they advance further I can't see how this is going to be helpful,"
 one frustrated senior diplomat said.
</p>

<p>
  John Bolton, the US ambassador to the UN, and his French counterpart, 
  Jean-Marc de la Sabliere, continued to meet behind closed doors and denied 
  they had reached a stalemate on the text.
</p>
<p>
  Most importantly, France appeared more interested than the Americans in an 
  offer by Lebanon on Monday to deploy 15,000 soldiers to secure the south 
  when the ceasefire begins. Tied to that would be clearer language on a 
  phased withdrawal of Israeli troops.
</p>
<p>
  Washington, however, is concerned that leaving the territory in the care of 
  mostly Lebanese forces would leave a dangerous vacuum.
</p>
<p>
  Last night, Tony Blair, currently holidaying in Barbados, discussed his 
  latest proposals in a telephone call with George Bush. Downing Street 
  sources said Mr Blair's plan involved deploying a mixture of Lebanese troops 
  and a strengthened UN force.
