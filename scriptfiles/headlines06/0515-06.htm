<p>The bad news came with the death of an elderly patient in
Britain two years ago. While seemingly unremarkable, this was
automatically the subject of an autopsy because the patient had a
blood transfusion in 1999 from a donor who had died later from the
human form of mad cow disease: variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease
(vCJD).</p>

In Britain, paranoia is rife about human-to-human vCJD
transmission via blood. This disease is the newest type of prion
disease in a group that includes bovine spongiform encephalopathy
(BSE). This automatic look-back policy on British blood product
recipients proved a grim genetic revelation, as well as the first
solid indication of what experts had feared: that the BSE epidemic
that has wiped out millions of cows was entering a new phase -
secondary transmission through humans.</p>
<p>Reported in 2004, elderly patients were the second probable case
of blood-borne vCJD transmitted between humans. The first was
identified months earlier, in December 2003, in a 62-year-old man
who died of vCJD six years after a blood transfusion. This man's
blood donor had been an apparently healthy young man who died of
vCJD three years after the donation.</p>
<p>A third blood transfusion-related case was identified in March
this year. All three were in Britain, the epicentre of the
declining but continuing two-decades-old BSE epidemic in which more
than 184,000 cows have been diagnosed with BSE and millions more
have been slaughtered as a precaution.</p>
<p>Although the patient died of unrelated causes, the spleen in the
second case was "loaded" with abnormal prion protein, according to
one expert. Prion protein is a Jekyll-and-Hyde protein. In normal
brains it helps create nerve cells. In diseased brains it changes
shape, misfolds and causes terminal damage.</p>
<p>In vCJD, unlike other types of CJD, it starts in the
lymphoreticular tissue. This includes the spleen, appendix, lymph
nodes and tonsils, and takes years to reach the brain where the
abnormal prion creates tiny "spongy" holes.</p>
<p>The second case marked a turning point in the history of vCJD,
which burst into the annals of disease just a decade ago (March 20,
1996) with the announcement in the House of Commons that a new
disease had been identified in 10 young British people and was
linked to the BSE epidemic.</p>
<p>Despite no symptoms of vCJD, the second patient was carrying the
infectious rogue prion and was a danger to anyone who received that
person's blood, organs or tissue, or whose surgery followed any
procedure performed in which the same metal instruments were used.
Most worrying was the genetic make-up in this case on one tiny
point of a gene all humans and other mammals carry - the prion
protein gene (PRNP) on chromosome 20.</p></div><div class="pageprint" id="contentSwap2"><a name="contentSwap2"></a>

<p>To date, all 191 victims of vCJD have shared a genetic trait.
They are MM at codon 129 of the PRNP gene. Forty per cent of
caucasians have the MM genotype. It had been hoped this was the
only susceptible population group.</p>
<p>But the second case, sadly, had the most common genetic type at
the codon 129 position of the PRNP gene. It is known as MV - a
trait shared by half of all caucasians.</p>
<p>This is the first identified vCJD-linked human to have the MV
genotype. The last 10 per cent of the population is known as VV on
codon 129, and until last month being VV was pretty good news if
you wanted to avoid vCJD.</p>
<p>BEFORE vCJD, there was another orally transmitted prion disease.
Kuru (the "shivering" disease, named after one symptom) probably
originated with a single case of CJD around 1900, in the Fore tribe
of the eastern highlands of Papua New Guinea. The disease nearly
wiped out the Fore, who ate the brains of dead relatives in a
mourning ritual.</p>
<p>However, cannibalism was prohibited in the 1950s and gradually
the epidemic died. But with the odd case still emerging, the
longest incubation period for this disease is now more than 40
years and serves as a model for what might happen with vCJD.</p>
<p>Recent genetic analysis of the scrupulously preserved records
and blood samples from the kuru epidemic show victims with the MM
genetic variation were younger when symptoms began (many were
children), probably had a shorter incubation period and a shorter
illness. Another study revealed most MV or VV individuals survived
the epidemic or developed kuru when older. The VV genotype -
reassuringly for those who might die of something else first - had
the longest incubation period, according to a 2001 study published
in the <i>Journal of Infectious Diseases</i>.</p>
<p>LAST month two papers provided additional foundation for the
kuru findings - that the MM genotype may affect merely the shorter
incubation victims of the human mad cow epidemic and that MV or VV
genotypes will live longer, but not necessarily escape the same
fate.</p>
<p>In the first, published in <i>The Lancet Neurology</i>, mice
whose PRNP gene had been replaced with the human counterpart did
not develop BSE when deliberately injected with it. However, when
vCJD was injected into MM and MV mice they were "equally
susceptible" to infection, although most of the MV mice did not
develop symptoms before the end of the 700-day experiment - their
natural life span.</p>

<p>The transmission rate of vCJD in the VV transgenic mice was much
less but indicated a rather grim scenario: that all three genotypes
on codon 129 showed subclinical or symptomless infection. What
differed was the incubation periods until symptoms either appeared
or the mice died. The mice were useful in showing that once BSE has
passed into humans in the form of vCJD, it was altered, which also
raised "concerns relevant to the possibility of secondary
transmission of vCJD through blood transfusion, fractionated blood
products, or contaminated surgical instruments", the authors
warned.</p>
</div><div class="pageprint" id="contentSwap3">
<p>And if the news could get worse, it did. A retrospective study
published in the <i>British Medical Journal</i> analysed the
genotypes of the three positive samples of infected tissue found
among 11,109 appendixes and 1565 tonsils removed in operations in
Britain between 1995 and 2000 from anonymous patients aged between
20 and 29. With enough DNA left in only two of the three positive
appendixes, the researchers found that is was "perhaps surprising"
to find they were both VV. This bad news is the first time that the
VV population in humans - the smallest population of the three
genotypes at codon 129 on the PRNP gene - has been found to be
potentially susceptible to vCJD infection.</p>
<p>Reaffirming earlier findings, the researchers from the national
CJD Surveillance Unit at the University of Edinburgh stated:
"Genetic studies of kuru, another orally transmitted human prion
disease, found that PRNP codon 129 MV and VV genotypes were
associated with longer incubation periods than the MM
genotype."</p>
<p>And the ramifications? With such a long incubation period
projected for VV genotypes, a potential risk for horizontal
transmission of vCJD infection by "blood transfusion, blood
products or contaminated surgical instruments" arises, underscoring
the vital need for continued surveillance of cases well into the
future, they warned.</p>
<p>Dr Andrew Hill, a molecular genetics expert who heads a
laboratory studying prion diseases at the Bio21 Institute at the
University of Melbourne, was one of the first to reveal through
mouse experiments reported in 2000 that there was a silent
reservoir of infection in symptomless prion disease carriers. The
latest mice revelations "confirm concerns we raised in our study",
he says. "These studies underlie the urgent need for a rapid,
sensitive test for infectious prions so we can identify potential
asymptomatic carriers.</p>
<p>"The blood bans [banning the donation of blood from any
Australian who has spent a cumulative six months or more in Britain
between 1980 and 1996 or who has ever had a blood transfusion]
still apply and people might question why."</p>
<p>While Australia remains free of BSE "you can't ignore this just
because it's happening overseas", he says.</p>

<p>Given Australia's historic migratory and tourism ties with
Britain in particular, Australian prion disease experts think it
inevitable that vCJD will emerge in Australia from someone infected
in Britain.</p>
<p>"I suppose it all really underscores the need for continuing CJD
surveillance in Australia," Professor James Ironside, from
Edinburgh's CJD Surveillance Centre, told the <i>Herald</i>. More
silent carriers as well as symptomatic vCJD cases in the 25
BSE-affected countries affected to date also loom.</p>

<p>Any continuing pattern of change to the genotypes of vCJD
victims could mark the beginning of the next phase of the human
epidemic.</p>
<b>THE TRAIL<br>
</b><br>
<b>Prion diseases</b>
<ul>
<li>Incurable, untreatable.</li>
<li>Definitive diagnosis only at
autopsy.</li>
<li>Widely accepted cause is that abnormal prion protein
misfolds, replicates, causes spongy holes in the brain.</li>
<li>Prions stick to metal
(cattle feed bins, surgical instruments).</li>
<li>Resistant to standard
surgical sterilisation.</li>
<li>In humans includes Kuru and
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease which has four main types:
<br>
<ol>
<li>Sporadic (no known cause).</li>
<li>Familial (inherited).</li>
<li>Iatrogenic (medically acquired).</li>
<li>Variant, the only type linked to cows.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
  <i><b>Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE)</b></i>
<ul>
<li>First reported 1986 in England.</li>
<li>Spread to other countries via
exports of live carrier cattle and meat-and-bonemeal protein
supplements (MBM).</li>
<li>Continuing cases in Britain
believed linked to MBM contamination of inadequately cleaned metal
feed bins.</li>
<li>Never appeared in Australasia.</li>
</ul>
<p><b><i>Variant CJD</i></b></p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>First reported 1996 in
England.</li>
<li>191 cases; Britain (161),
France (18), other countries (12); none in Australasia.</li>
<li>Looks and behaves
differently to other CJD types.</li>
<li>Only type to transmit
between humans via blood.</li>
<li>Until now all cases are MM
genotype; BUT one carrier case is MV; two VV genotype cases in
appendixes</li>
