<p>British forces are facing rising violence among Shia Muslim factions in southern Iraq, but are powerless to contain it, military and diplomatic sources have told The Independent on Sunday. Both British and Iraqi authorities were seeking to play down the situation, they added. </p>

BRITS 'HELPLESS'<br>

The hidden political and factional tensions in the British zone of Iraq, particularly in Basra, were highlighted by a car bomb in the center of the country's second city on Friday. The local police said 10 were killed and 15 wounded. Hospital sources said at least five bodies were brought in. But the provincial governor, embroiled in a bitter dispute with the police chief, insisted only two people were killed. As violent incidents have increased recently, political leaders in other southern cities have also tried to minimise casualty figures.</p>
<p>In Baghdad the Prime Minister, Nouri al-Maliki, is due to present a national reconciliation plan to parliament today, aimed at reducing sectarian violence and defusing a significant portion of the Sunni insurgency, although Saddam Hussein loyalists and foreign fighters such as al-Qa'ida are excluded. There are question- marks over the plan, but it will do nothing to heal tensions among Shias in their southern heartland.</p>
<p>Last week, as the Foreign Secretary, Margaret Beckett, was declaring that the withdrawal of British forces from parts of Iraq was evidence of "mission accomplished", the senior British commander in the country disclosed that the security situation in Basra had deteriorated.</p>
<p>Lieutenant General Nick Houghton told the Commons defence committee: "There is a worrying amount of violence and murder carried out between rival Shia factions. There is no doubt that it has got worse of late, due to the protracted period of talks to form the government."</p>
<p>Since a spate of bomb attacks against them last autumn, British forces have largely kept out of the center of Basra. Much of the police force in the south has been taken over by Shia militias who often clash with one another as well as intimidating ordinary people and attacking what is left of the Sunni community in the south.</p>
<p>Earlier this month a Sunni mosque in Basra was stormed by the overwhelmingly Shia police force and 12 died - a day after a market bombing killed 28. The police said they wanted to search the mosque following intelligence that arms and explosives linked to the bombing were stored there, and claimed they only returned fire after people inside the mosque began shooting at them.</p>
<p>Omar Rashid (not his full name), a Sunni carpenter of 34, injured by flying glass during the exchange, denied police claims. "This was not the first time they have raided this mosque," he said. "I have had two members of my family killed, another 10 have fled."</p>
<p>British forces have been bystanders in these clashes, but for the first time, according to sources on the ground, they are coming under pressure from political factions to leave areas of the south so that their militia allies can move in. While there was a co-ordinated announcement last week that Iraqi security forces would soon take responsibility for Muthanna, a province bordering Saudi Arabia, the Iraqi authorities suddenly announced the next day that the more volatile Maysan province, where British soldiers have been killed this year, would also be handed over.</p>
<p>The relatively small number of British troops in the two provinces will not be brought home, but will be deployed in Basra, where Mr Maliki declared a state of emergency during a visit from the capital last month. The decision, which he said was taken in response to the growing violence, is said to have caught British officials by surprise. It was seen as a flexing of muscle by the new Prime Minister, but also emphasizes how little control Britain has over events in the region.</p>
