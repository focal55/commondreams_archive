<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->House Democrats sent a strong signal to President Bush on Tuesday that 
they will attach conditions he is likely to find unpalatable, perhaps even 
unacceptable, to his anticipated request early next year for another $100 
billion or more to pay for the war in Iraq.  
<P>At the least, Speaker-to-be Nancy Pelosi of San Francisco and other 
leaders of the incoming Democratic majority said they will seek to enforce 
greater transparency for the billions of dollars in contracts that the Pentagon 
pays private firms to perform numerous functions in Iraq. 
<P>Amid reports of corruption and missing funds from government contracts, 
the Democrats also want to establish a special committee patterned after the 
World War II-era panel that Sen. Harry Truman chaired to root out waste and 
fraud in war contracting. 
<P>But some of the most outspoken anti-war voices in the House said they want 
to go much further and use the supplemental spending bill  --  the special bill 
passed by Congress to pay for the expense of the war  --  to force Bush to 
bring home the 140,000 U.S. military personnel in Iraq. 

<P>Even if Bush, under increasing pressure to sharply change Iraq policy, 
were to make changes, he might find legislative conditions imposed by the 
Democrats unacceptable or perhaps argue it is an unconstitutional intrusion 
into his powers as commander in chief. That would set up a confrontation with 
the new Democratic Congress. 
<P>The ideas voiced by Pelosi and the other House Democratic leaders came 
after the caucus met Tuesday to discuss Iraq policy and before today's release 
of the bipartisan Iraq Study Group's report. 
<P>The group, headed by Republican former Secretary of State James Baker and 
Democratic former Rep. Lee Hamilton, is expected to call for a start of 
withdrawals tied to success in training Iraqi forces to do more of the fighting 
in a war that has lasted 3 1/2 years and killed more than 2,900 U.S. soldiers. 
<P>But Democrats across the board said the panel's recommendations won't be a 
silver bullet, as Rep. Mike Thompson, D-St. Helena, put it. 
<P>"There will be standards required," Pelosi said, in the supplemental 
spending bill, which some reports say could total $125 billion or more. That 
would bring spending on the war to more than $500 billion. "There will be 
transparency," she added. 
<P>Democrats want to draw a distinction between opposing the war and 
supporting the U.S. troops. Asked if Democrats would seek to end the war by 
voting against the new money, Pelosi answered, "Absolutely not ... Democrats 
will be there to support the troops." 
<P>One of her deputies, Rep. Rahm Emanuel of Chicago, said the debate over 
more money for Iraq "will be a turning point for a new direction for Iraq." 
<P>Asked if that means calling for withdrawals, he said, "We are now at the 
beginning of figuring out those questions in the proper way." 
<P>A good part of what the Democrats will do depends on what policy changes 
Bush makes. In addition to the Baker-Hamilton study group, the Pentagon is 
conducting a policy review that was started before Bush named Robert Gates to 
replace Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld. Gates said Tuesday at his 
confirmation hearing that the administration will consider all options because 
of the policy failures in Iraq. Gates may be confirmed as early as today.  
<P>Leading House Democrats, including Pelosi and incoming International 
Relations Committee chairman Tom Lantos of San Mateo, have written Bush three 
letters outlining their plans for Iraq. They want withdrawals to start, 
recommend an international conference including all of Iraq's neighbors, 
propose that Iraq's Constitution be amended to satisfy all ethnic groups and 
call for Iraqi militias to be disarmed. 
<P>The last letter was sent on Oct. 20, before the midterm election in which 
Democrats took control of both houses of Congress in a vote they viewed as a 
call for a new direction in Iraq. 
<P>"We have not heard back from the president and we extend the hand of 
friendship to him to work together in bipartisan way," Pelosi said. 
<P>Among those who spoke to the Democratic caucus was Rep. John Murtha, 
D-Pa., a longtime military booster and former Iraq war supporter who turned 
against the war more than a year ago. Murtha, who will chair the military 
appropriations subcommittee when the Democrats take control Jan. 4, promised 
vigorous oversight of how money for Iraq is spent. 
<P>"Stay tuned," Pelosi said. "Democrats are now in the majority. . . . There 
will be hearings. There will be oversight. We will not abdicate our 
responsibility." 
<P>But there are divisions among the Democrats. Rep. Dennis Kucinich, D-Ohio, 
passed out a seven-page paper to his colleagues calling on them to vote against 
future funds for Iraq as a way to end the war. "The American people will have 
trouble understanding any of us who say we oppose the war and simultaneously 
vote to fund it," he said. 
<P>Rep. Barbara Lee, D-Oakland, who has voted against past war appropriations 
bills, said she will vote against the next one. 
<P>"The voters gave us our marching orders last month. They want this war to 
end," she said. 

<P>Lee said Murtha pledged that the appropriations bill will include a 
Lee-sponsored provision banning the use of any funds to build permanent U.S. 
bases in Iraq. 
<P>And Rep. Lynn Woolsey, D-Petaluma, who also has been in the small minority 
to vote against war funds, said the House should call for withdrawal and tell 
Bush that it will not approve any further war supplemental spending bills. 
<P>On that last point, there is wide agreement among the Democrats. They say 
that by removing the war funding from the regular appropriations process the 
administration has deepened the budget deficit and hidden the war's true cost. 
<P>The administration has argued that a separate bill is necessary because it 
is impossible to accurately estimate war costs far enough ahead of time to 
include them in the regular budget and appropriations process.
<P> <b>Democratic rule takes shape </b>
<P>Rep. Nancy Pelosi announced the 
Democratic Party leadership's choices to run six top House committees. 
Confirmations are expected today. The six Democratic chairs are:  
<P>Rep. John Dingell of Michigan  --  Energy and Commerce Committee 
<P>Rep. David Obey of Wisconsin  --  Appropriations Committee 
<P>Rep. Charles Rangel of New York  --  Ways and Means Committee 
<P>Rep. Barney Frank of Massachusetts  --  Financial Services Committee 
<P>Rep. John Spratt of South Carolina  --  Budget Committee 
<P>Rep. Louise Slaughter of New York  --  Rules Committee
