<p>Howard Zinn, a celebrated American political scientist, addressed University of Wisconsin students at the Memorial Union Theater Tuesday about the importance of history and democracy to provide context to current issues in government and war.

        Zinn said his focus is on “clear” history, which he defined as making individual decisions about how to perceive historical and current events, because it makes people aware of their own interests.
<p>“It is a lie to say we are one great happy family with the same interest,” Zinn said. “Exxon and I do not have the same interests, and Bush and the soldiers do not have the same interest.”
<p>Zinn continued to advocate the importance of shattering the myth of American exceptionalism. Slavery and racial segregation, Zinn added, are just two examples of America’s imperfections.
<p>Zinn also said patriotism continues to be misinterpreted by comparing the message conveyed by the Statue of Liberty and the walls being built on the California-Mexico boarder to stop illegal immigration.
<p>“We need to expand patriotism to a world without national boundaries, so everyone is our brother and sister and our children,” Zinn said. “This is the only way to eliminate war.”
<p>UW history professor Alfred McCoy said Zinn told “the story of humankind.”
<p>“Zinn reminds us of our need to call for an activist engagement and join the people’s army to struggle for social justice and a better collective future,” McCoy said.
<p>Zinn also said he was excited for the opportunity to address college students, referring to them as “special citizens.”
<p>“Students are freer to divest themselves from the intellectual baggage that they got from high school and their parents,” he said.
<p>UW senior Sarah Williams attended the lecture and said discussing history is vital to understanding the implications of current events.
<p>“I think it is important to hear different perspectives and educate yourself on different issues,” Williams said. “It keeps an open dialogue going in universities and communities.”
<p>Students are important because students are the coming generation of this country, Zinn added.
<p>“Young people need to think historically about American foreign policy, the Middle East and war,” Zinn said. “History is too indispensable for understanding what is going on today.”
<p>Zinn’s lecture, titled “You cannot be neutral,” was part of the Distinguished Lecture Series presented by the Wisconsin Union Directorate.
