<p>In a major blow to one of the most infamous war profiteers operating in
Iraq, Afghanistan and New Orleans, a federal appeals court has ruled
that a wrongful death lawsuit filed against the mercenary firm <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackwater_USA">Blackwater USA</a>
can proceed in North Carolina's state courts. The suit was brought by
the families of the four Blackwater contractors ambushed and killed in
Falluja, Iraq on March 31, 2004. Blackwater had tried to have the same case
dismissed or moved to federal court.</p>

<p>"I've been bawling ever since I've heard the decision," says Katy
Helvenston, whose son Scott was killed in Falluja, his charred body
hung from a bridge. "It's been overwhelming. I am so glad that they
ruled this way. Blackwater has stalled and stalled. Look at the
hundreds of millions of dollars in profits in Iraq and New Orleans
they've made since my son was killed. It's time to go to trial and let
the chips fall where they may."</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.thenation.com/doc/20060508/scahill">lawsuit</a>, filed
in January 2005, alleges that Blackwater cut corners in the interest of
profits, leading to the brutal deaths of the four men: Scott
Helvenston, Jerko "Jerry" Zovko, Mike Teague and Wes Batalona. "It has
now been more than a year and a half since the lawsuit was filed, and
Blackwater has managed to stall and frustrate the litigation," Marc
Miles, an attorney for the families, told me. "I anticipate that this
matter will now be on a fast track to trial, and believe that a jury
will ultimately find Blackwater liable for its wrongful conduct in
causing the deaths of these four Americans."
</p>
<p>In its motion to dismiss the case in federal court, Blackwater argued
that the families of the four men are entitled only to government
insurance payments under the federal Defense Base Act. Many firms
specializing in contractor law advertise the DBA as the best way for
corporations servicing the war to avoid being sued. "What Blackwater is
trying to do is to sweep all of their wrongful conduct into the Defense
Base Act," says Miles. Blackwater spokesperson Chris Taylor told the
Associated Press, "We are reviewing the decision."
</p>
<p>Blackwater argued in its appeal that the four men "were performing a
classic military function...with authorization from the Office of the
Secretary of Defense that classified their missions as 'official
duties' in support of the Coalition Provisional Authority" and
therefore any court, federal or state, "may not impose liability for
casualties sustained in the battlefield in the performance of these
duties." In other words, because Blackwater was supporting the
occupation with its forces, the company is immune from damages or
lawsuits. The court said this argument "proves too much" to permit,
saying Blackwater's "constitutional interpretations" were "too
extravagantly recursive for us to accept."
</p>
<p>The ruling Thursday by the three-judge panel of the 4th US Circuit
Court of Appeals gives "the green light" to a trial that the families
believe will show that Blackwater was ultimately responsible for the
deaths of their loved ones, says attorney Miles. The incident sparked
the first US siege of Falluja, in April 2004, resulting in the deaths
of more than 600 Iraqis.
</p>
<p>"The message that this ruling sends to Blackwater is that it must now
face the evidence in this case, including answering tough questions and
producing critical documents, which it has refused to do for more than
a year and a half," says Miles. "Blackwater cannot be allowed to get
away with murder and that's what they're trying to do," adds
Helvenston. "There's got to be accountability."
