<p>WASHINGTON  - Women peace activists launched Thursday a global campaign to end warfare and bloodshed in Iraq. The ''<a href="http://www.womensaynotowar.org/" target="_new">Women Say No to War</a>'' campaign comes as the Bush administration contends with growing opposition to its Iraq policy.</p>
<p>Pennsylvania Democratic Congressman John Murtha, a former Marine and Vietnam veteran who had backed the war, said this week in an ABC News interview that were he eligible to join the U.S. military now, he would not and nor would he expect others to join.</p>
<p>Gen. Peter Pace, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, took the unusual step of wading into an ongoing political controversy Thursday, when he told a Pentagon news conference that Murtha's comments were damaging to troop morale and recruitment efforts.</p>
<p>Murtha, the House of Representatives' top Democrat on military spending, replied in a statement that ''the military had no problem recruiting directly after 9/11 because everyone understood that we had been attacked. But now the military's ability to attract recruits is being hampered by the prospect of prolonged, extended and repeated deployments; inadequate equipment; shortened home stays; the lack of any connection between Iraq and the brutal attacks of 9/11; and--most importantly--the administration's constantly changing, undefined, open-ended military mission in Iraq.''</p>
<p>Murtha had voted in favor of going to war against Iraq, so he triggered a rhetorical firestorm in Congress last November when he called for the immediate withdrawal of U.S. troops. Since then, he has repeatedly asserted that many of those soldiers are hindering Iraq's progress toward stability and self-governance.</p>
<p>Likewise, the <a href="http://www.womensaynotowar.org/" target="_new">Women Say No to War campaign</a> is to call for the withdrawal of all foreign troops and foreign fighters from Iraq.</p>
<p>The campaign's demands are to be delivered in a statement bearing a targeted 100,000 signatures and to be handed to leaders in Washington, D.C. and to U.S. embassies around the globe on March 8--International Women's Day and less than two weeks shy of the third anniversary of the U.S.- and U.K.-led invasion of Iraq, which began on March 20, 2003.</p>
<p>''Iraqi women are devastated now, and it will take us decades of struggle to regain a peaceful and civilized life,'' Yanar Mohammed, a campaign endorser and president of the Organization of Women's Freedom in Iraq, said in a statement. ''The U.S. occupation has planted seeds of ethno-sectarian division, preparing Iraq for a civil war, and has blessed religious supremacy over and against human and women's rights.''</p>

<p>Initiated by the group CODEPINK: Women for Peace, the effort sets out to be the highest-profile of a very small number of campaigns that have sought to bring women together across borders to demand an end to the bloodshed in Iraq.</p>
<p>More than 3,000 women signed on before the campaign launched, according to Medea Benjamin, co-founder of CODEPINK and the San Francisco-based human rights group Global Exchange. By Sunday, the number of endorsers on the campaign's <a href="http://www.womensaynotowar.org/" target="_new">Web site</a> had grown to nearly 10,000.</p>
<p>Signatories include Gold Star Families for Peace founder Cindy Sheehan, whose son was killed serving in the U.S. military in Iraq and who grabbed headlines and galvanized activists last summer when she camped outside President George W. Bush's ranch in Texas while he stayed there on vacation.</p>
<p>Other endorsers include Gold Star mother Rose Gentle of Scotland; entertainers Susan Sarandon, Eve Ensler, and Margaret Cho; authors Alice Walker, Anne Lamott, Maxine Hong Kingston, and Barbara Ehrenreich; and legislators Barbara Lee, Cynthia McKinney, and Lynn Woolsey of the U.S., Libby Davies of Canada, and Caroline Lucas of the U.K. </p>
<p>In addition to Mohammed, Iraqi endorsers include Hana Ibrahim of Iraqi Women's Will.</p>
<p>In the campaign document, the women declare that ''we have had enough of the senseless war in Iraq and the cruel attacks on civilians around the world. We've buried too many of our loved ones. We've seen too many lives crippled forever by physical and mental wounds. We've watched in horror as our precious resources are poured into war while our families' basic needs of food, shelter, education, and healthcare go unmet.''</p>
<p>CODEPINK, in a statement, said the Iraq war has cost the lives of ''tens of thousands of Iraqis (estimates range from 27,736 to 100,000); 2,182 U.S. troops; 98 U.K. troops; and hundreds of humanitarian workers.''</p>
<p>''As the three-year anniversary of the invasion of Iraq approaches, the country is still wracked by violence, Iraqi civilians are suffering from a lack of basic services including electricity and clean water, and women's rights are under attack.''</p>
<p>The attempt to unite and mobilize women peace activists worldwide also marks a new effort to diversify the U.S. peace movement. Anti-war groups have made alliances with veterans', military families', black, immigrant, religious, and business groups across the country. In the run up to and immediately after the invasion, the San Francisco crowds that produced some of the country's angriest protests featured suit-clad executives--among them a former president of the Pacific Exchange stock market. </p>

<p>Diversity has brought dilemmas, however. While a broad spectrum of organizations came together to protest the rising death toll in Iraq the larger movement stands at a crossroads.
<p>
Individual groups have taken divergent positions on Iraqi resistance to the U.S.-led occupation, for example, and on when and on what terms to demand that American troops be withdrawn.
<p>
Many activists eager to shield U.S. troops from harm continue to grapple over the content of a good exit strategy. Would simply withdrawing the 150,000-odd American soldiers in Iraq leave a thoroughly destabilized country even more vulnerable to sectarian extremists who have harnessed religious zeal to ensure a steady supply of recruits? Would it appear to vindicate those groups' violent tactics and clear the way for them to kill more civilians and to oppress Iraqi women?
<p>
CODEPINK seems to think it has found a way to resolve some of those differences. It said the Women Say No to War document urges ''a shift in strategy in Iraq, from a military model to a conflict resolution model'' in which women would be fully represented in the peacemaking process and all sides would make a firm commitment to women's full equality in post-war Iraq.</p>
