<p>Chemical pollutants in the environment could be one driver behind the 
  soaring rates of breast cancer, a report has claimed. 
</p>


        
          
          
            <p>
  Changes in lifestyle have been blamed for an 81 per cent increase in the 
  incidence of the disease in Britain since the early 1970s but the role of 
  chemicals has been neglected, it says. 
</p>
<p>
  In the report for the <a href="http://www.panda.org/">World Wildlife Fund for Nature</a> (WWF), Andreas 
  Kortenkamp, from London University's School of Pharmacy, says exposure to 
  pollutants used in the manufacture of products from plastics to cosmetics 
  has a known "endocrine disrupting" effect.
</p>
<p>
  The chemicals mimic the female sex-hormone oestrogen, and have been blamed 
  for "feminised" fish and frogs, as well as declining sperm counts 
  in men, and may also be helping to trigger breast cancer. The claim was 
  immediately dismissed by Cancer Research UK who said the report contained "
no new findings" and did not review all the evidence available.
</p>
<p>
  The WWF, which campaigns against hormone-disrupting chemicals, has been 
  pressing the European Union to finalise new legislation called REACH, which 
  is designed to protect people and the environment from man-made chemicals in 
  the face of resistance from the industry.

</p>
<p>
  In the WWF report, Dr Kortenkamp points out that less than half of new 
  breast cancer cases can be explained solely by lifestyle factors and 
  genetics.
</p>
<p>
  He highlights two key ways that oestrogenic chemicals may be contributing to 
  breast cancer.
</p>
<p>
  One is the "cocktail effect" of exposure to several different 
  oestrogen-mimicking chemicals. The other is exposure to the chemicals during 
  critical periods, such as when baby girls are in the womb, or at puberty. He 
  said: "To prove or dismiss a link with breast cancer, exposure to 
  chemicals must be recorded many years before the cancer becomes manifest.
</p>
<p>
  "Measuring chemicals at a time when the disease is diagnosed will miss 
  important features and will provide a warped picture."
</p>

<p>
  The paper calls for strong legislation to control endocrine disrupters.
</p>
<p>
  Dr Kortenkamp said a recent Spanish study had demonstrated an association 
  between breast cancer risk and oestrogen-mimicking chemicals.
</p>
<p>
  "This is the first evidence that chemicals in our environment, with 
  oestrogenic properties that are 'accidental', and not just natural hormones 
  or pharmaceutical oestrogens, may contribute to the development of breast 
  cancer," he said.
</p>
<p>
  Josephine Querido, information officer at Cancer Research UK, said: "
  This report does not present any new findings and does not review all of the 
  evidence available.
</p>
<p>

  "There is considerable public concern about whether hormone-disrupting 
  chemicals - both in the environment and in household goods - affect breast 
  cancer risk.
</p>
<p>
  "But it has not been proven conclusively that they do, and a number of 
  studies have contradicted the suggestion.
</p>
<p>
  "Compared with the levels of natural oestrogen circulating in a woman's 
  blood, the levels of these chemicals are very small indeed. The increase in 
  breast cancer rates in the last few decades has been linked to lifestyle 
  changes. These include the trend for women to have fewer children later in 
  life, increased bodyweight in post menopausal women, the use of hormone 
  treatments like HRT and the Pill and increasing alcohol consumption."
