<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->HIBHIB, Iraq - The two 230-kilogram bombs that killed Abu Musab al-Zarqawi pulverized the brick house where he spent his final minutes, vaporizing walls and the foundation, hurling concrete blocks 90 metres into the weeds and blasting a crater 12 metres wide and deep.
<P></P> "A big hole, sir," said Sgt.-Major Gary Rimpley, 46, of Penrose, Colo., who reached the scene about 90 minutes after the bombs fell.<P></P> Yesterday, three days after the air strike that ended the life of Iraq's most feared terrorist leader, the scene here was a bit tidier than in those first minutes after the attack: the bodies of the six people, including a child, who U.S. officers say died in the strike, were gone. The most useful bits of intelligence had been carted away. The once-gaping crater was reduced by bulldozer to a ditch.<P></P> Still, given the extraordinary destruction evident at the house, a number of questions lingered, including how anyone could have survived such an attack, even for a few minutes, as U.S. and Iraqi officials say al-Zarqawi did. It seemed puzzling, too, surveying the destruction, how al-Zarqawi's head and upper body, shown on television screens across the world, could have remained largely intact.<P></P> With rumours circulating in the Iraqi media that al-Zarqawi had begun to run from the house as the first bomb struck, U.S. officials said two military pathologists had arrived in Iraq to perform an autopsy to determine the precise cause of his death.<P></P>One Iraqi witness has come forward and told reporters a man resembling al-Zarqawi was pulled from an ambulance by U.S. troops and beaten before he died. For now, whatever clues remained of al-Zarqawi's violent life lay in the rubble of the house in Hibhib, about 50 kilometres north of Baghdad.<P></P> In one corner of the wreckage lay a leaflet from Council of Holy Warriors, the militant organization that al-Zarqawi's group, Al Qaeda in Iraq, claimed to have joined in his final months.<P></P> In another corner lay a half-used tube of Deep Heat, a balm offering "Fast Relief From Muscle Aches and Pains."<P></P> There were pages from a <i>Newsweek</i> dated May 2, a flattened carton of Crown pineapple juice and a can of Diet Pepsi, unopened at its top but the rest of it shredded by the blast.<P></P> Yesterday, the U.S. command's chief spokesman, Maj.-Gen. William B. Caldwell, reversed an earlier announcement and confirmed one of the six people who died in the bombing with al-Zarqawi was a small girl, around 5 or 6 years old.<P></P>Also yesterday, insurgents signalled that al-Zarqawi's death has not ended their fight, posting an Internet video showing the beheading of three alleged Shiite death squad members in revenge for killing Sunnis.<P></P>The video &#8212; as grisly as any al-Zarqawi ever issued &#8212; was clearly designed to quash hopes the Sunni-dominated insurgency might change tactics by ending attacks on Shiite civilians and institutions.<P></P> Factional fighting continued yesterday, killing 24 people. <P></P>Gunmen stopped a minivan carrying Sunnis on a highway near Baghdad, ordered the passengers off and opened fire, killing four and wounding one. In Baghdad, gunmen in two cars shot dead a Shiite metal worker and wounded two others. Also in the capital, a roadside bomb exploded in the mainly Shiite Karadah area, targeting a police patrol and killing five.<P></P> In the northern city of Mosul, gunmen killed three Shiite butchers.<P></P>With files from Associated Press
