  The unprecedented wave of immigrants' rights protests sweeping the United 
  States reached a new high yesterday as an estimated two million people took 
  to the streets in 140 different cities around the country &shy; an extraordinary 
  mobilisation many supporters are likening to a second civil rights movement.

  The National Day of Action took many forms including a consumer boycott by 
  immigrants and labour stoppages. Probably the biggest demonstration took 
  place along the National Mall in Washington where many tens of thousands 
  gathered on a brilliant spring afternoon to listen to speeches urging unity 
  and proclaiming the Hispanic community's love of its adopted nation. 
  Thousands were waving flags. Some were of Latin American countries, but the 
  overwhelming majority waved the Stars and Stripes.
</p>
<p>
  "They want to have a law to make all us criminals," said Celerino 
  Lopez, a construction worker from Oaxaca, Mexico. He and his wife crossed 
  the desert to enter the US illegally nine years ago. He said there were no 
  jobs or opportunities at home. 

</p>
<p>
  "We come here to work, we are not terrorists. I want my child to learn 
  English and to get a job," he said. 
</p>
<p>
  The demonstration took place just yards from the Capitol, where Senators 
  last week failed to reach agreement on wide-ranging immigration reform that 
  might have offered a way for the nation's estimated 12 million undocumented 
  immigrants to achieve legal recognition and greater security.
</p>
<p>
  Politicians from both major parties have been blindsided by the protests, 
  whose size and passion caught everyone off guard. Two weeks ago, Los Angeles 
  saw the biggest protest in its history as half a million people took to the 
  streets. On Sunday, up to half a million marched through the centre of 
  Dallas, while smaller protests rocked such unlikely outposts of immigrant 
  activism as Des Moines, Iowa, and Boise, Idaho. 
</p>
<p>
  The immigrants have reacted first and foremost to draconian legislation 
  proposed by radical Republicans in the House of Representatives to 
  criminalise anyone in the country without proper residency papers and to 
  build a military fence along 700 miles of the 2,000-mile US-Mexico border. 
</p>

<p>
  But there is also a deeper feeling that in a nation of immigrants it is 
  wrong for millions of people, whose labour is essential to the service 
  economy, to live in the shadows, many of the woefully underpaid and at 
  constant risk of exploitation or abrupt termination. "They are trying 
  to make us criminals but we are not," said Kary Garcia, 17, a high 
  school student whose parents brought her to the US seven years ago from 
  Mexico City. "We do the jobs Americans don't want. We do the hard jobs."</p>
<p>
  Illegal immigrants pay thousands of dollars for the chance of a new life. 
  One Salvadorian man, Roberto, said he paid $13,000 (&pound;7,500) to smugglers two 
  years ago to bring him and his son. "It took one month. Train, bus, 
  everything," he said. 
</p>
<p>
  The protest movement has split Republicans, with radicals sticking to their 
  aggressively anti-immigrant agenda while moderates &shy; including President 
  George Bush &shy; have appealed for a compromise that would end the unregulated 
  inflow of migrants across the Mexican border and establish a framework 
  recognising the realities of the US labour market.
</p>

<p>
  The Democrats, meanwhile, have largely failed to seize on the issue &shy; 
  appearing more afraid of the large number of Americans who don't think 
  immigrants should be cut any slack.
</p>
<p>
  The protests have already pushed the Senate in a more progressive direction. 
  A package that would give most, if not all, illegal immigrants a path to 
  residency and citizenship, establish a guest worker programme and beef up 
  security on the border came close to approval before being scuppered at the 
  last moment. 
</p>
<p>
  "Neither party can afford to shrug off or ignore the surging street 
  rallies materialising before their eyes," said Marc Cooper, a border 
  specialist at the University of Southern California's Institute for Justice 
  and Journalism. "They can all do the math. While the 'illegals' can't 
  vote, they have millions of cousins, uncles and even children who can &shy; and 
  will."
