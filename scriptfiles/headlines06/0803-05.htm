<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><P>Mexico's defeated leftwing presidential candidate, Andr&eacute;s Manuel L&oacute;pez Obrador, has turned a large slice of central Mexico City into a protest camp as part of his attempt to force a recount of last month's presidential election.<P>The occupation of Z&oacute;calo Plaza and about six miles of the Reforma Avenue follows a series of marches that culminated in the biggest demonstration in modern Mexican history on Sunday. Estimates of the number of participants ranged from 350,000 to more than 2 million.<P><!--/beginimage/-->

Tents set up by supporters of Mexican presidential candidate Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador are seen at the main Zocalo plaza in Mexico City, Mexico, on Tuesday, Aug. 1, 2006. Hanging protest banners from sculptures and pitching tents in the middle of Mexico City's historic Reforma boulevard, supporters of the country's leftist presidential candidate paralyzed the city's financial district Monday and refused to leave until the top electoral court rules on demands for a recount in the disputed race.

    A tent city of L&oacute;pez Obrador followers sprung up after the march. Mr L&oacute;pez Obrador, who based his campaign on the promise of turning the status quo upside down to favour the poor, is sleeping there too. Every morning he goes on a walkabout, during which he is typically mobbed by supporters, and every evening he gives a morale-boosting speech to a crowd of devoted supporters.<P>The occupation is expected to last until the electoral tribunal rules on Mr L&oacute;pez Obrador's appeal for a recount, which it must do before August 31.<P>The roadblocks, which have divided opinion in the city, mark a significant escalation of the dispute that began the night of the election on July 2, when both front-runners claimed victory. Mr L&oacute;pez Obrador has also hinted at further, unspecified disruptive action to come, with the stock market and the peso looking a little less steady every day.<P>The 52-year-old son of a shopkeeper from a swampy south-eastern backwater claims he was cheated by fiddled figures in the official vote count, which he lost to the governing party candidate, Felipe Calder&oacute;n, by less than 0.6%.<P>He accuses the Calder&oacute;n camp of orchestrating the alleged fraud with the complicity of the electoral authorities. Mr Calder&oacute;n, a rather grey lawyer who picked up votes through a scare campaign comparing his rival to Venezuela's controversial president, Hugo Ch&aacute;vez, insists his victory was clean.<P>With Mr L&oacute;pez Obrador radicalising his measures, the Calder&oacute;n camp has raised the tone of its rebuffs. One prominent party figure, Diego de Cevallos, this week called Mr L&oacute;pez Obrador a psychopath.<P>And while Mr L&oacute;pez Obrador's claims convince many Mexicans suspicious of all things electoral due to the fraudulent tradition that helped keep one party in power from 1929 to 2000, the evidence produced persuades few serious commentators.
