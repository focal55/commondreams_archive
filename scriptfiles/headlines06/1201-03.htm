The assessment by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, one 
of the government's premier research centers, is the most sweeping condemnation 
of such voting systems by a federal agency. 
<P>In a report hailed by critics of electronic voting, the institute said 
voting systems should allow election officials to recount ballots independently 
from a voting machine's software. The recommendations endorse "optical-scan" 
systems in which voters mark paper ballots that are read by a computer and 
electronic systems that print a paper summary of each ballot, which voters 
review and elections officials save for recounts. 
<P>The institute's recommendations are to be debated next week before the 
Technical Guidelines Development Committee, charged by Congress to develop 
standards for voting systems. To become effective, the institute's 
recommendations must then be adopted by the Election Assistance Commission, 
which was created by Congress to promote changes in election systems after the 
2000 debacle in Florida. 
<P>If the commission agrees with the National Institute of Standards and 
Technology, the practical impact may not be felt until 2009 or 2010, the 
soonest that new standards would be implemented. The standards that the 
Election Assistance Commission will adopt are voluntary, but most states 
require election officials to deploy voting systems that meet national or 
federal criteria. 

<P>The institute says in its report that the lack of a paper trail for each 
vote "is one of the main reasons behind continued questions about voting system 
security and diminished public confidence in elections." The report repeats the 
contention of computer security experts that "a single programmer could 'rig' a 
major election." 
<P>Fears about rigging have animated critics for years, but there has been no 
conclusive evidence that such fraud has occurred. Electronic voting systems 
have had technical problems  --  including unpredictable screen freezes  --  
leaving voters wondering whether their ballots were properly recorded. 
<P>Computer scientists and others have said that the security of electronic 
voting systems cannot be guaranteed and that election officials should adopt 
systems that produce a paper record of each vote in case of a recount. The 
institute report embraces that critique, introducing the concept of "software 
independence" in voting systems. 
<P>The institute says voting systems should not rely on a machine's software 
to provide a record of the votes cast. Some electronic voting system 
manufacturers have introduced models that include printers to produce a 
separate record of each vote  --  and that can be verified by a voter before 
leaving the machine  --  but such paper trails have had their own problems. 
<P>Printers have jammed or otherwise failed, causing some election directors 
to question whether a paper trail is an improvement. Maryland state elections 
administrator Linda Lamone, in an undated video snippet that her critics have 
circulated on the Internet, says voter verification is unnecessary. 
<P>"I'm not going to put this paper on my machines  --  it'll be over my dead 
body, because I just don't think it works. It really is a false sense of 
security," she said. 
<P>For critics of paperless electronic voting, the report is vindication. "I 
think I got it right," said Aviel Rubin, a Johns Hopkins University computer 
scientist who has long questioned the security and reliability of some 
electronic voting systems. 
<P>Linda Schade, a founder of TrueVoteMD, which has pressed for a system that 
provides a verifiable paper record of each vote, said, "These strong statements 
from a credible institution such as NIST add yet another voice to the consensus 
that paper electronic voting as used in states like (Maryland) is not secure. 
We hope that the (Election Assistance Commission) formally adopts these 
improved standards." 
<P>Even critics of paperless electronic voting have grown disenchanted with 
the practical problems of adding printers to electronic "touch-screen" voting 
machines. 
<P>" 'Why are we doing this at all?' is the question people are asking," said 
Warren Stewart, policy director of VoteTrustUSA, a group critical of electronic 
voting systems. "We have a perfectly good system  --  the paper-ballot 
optical-scan system."
