Supporters of the once iconic Cold War US foe took to the streets in celebration, but his closest rival, conservative Eduardo Montealegre insisted quick counts showed he and Ortega were headed to a run-off.</p>
<p>With more than 14 percent of the polling stations counted, Ortega had 40 percent of Sunday's votes and a lead of almost seven points over Montealegre, a US-educated financier favored by Washington.</p>
<p>A candidate needs at least 35 percent and a lead of five points to win outright and avert a second round of voting.</p>

<p>As the preliminary results were announced, the US administration, which had already been accused of meddling, faced renewed criticism after its monitoring team raised questions about the transparency of the voting.</p>
<p>During the campaign, Washington had urged Nicaraguans to defeat Ortega, whose Soviet-backed Sandinista government seized private assets, distributed land to poor peasants and battled US-financed Contra rebels for a decade before he was voted out of office in 1990.</p>
<p>Montealegre had 33.29 percent and fellow-conservative Jose Rizo got 19.5 percent in the partial results announced 10 hours after most polling stations closed.</p>
<p>"There is already a statement from the delegation of the United States that is talking of the elections not being transparent," said Roberto Rivas, who heads Nicaragua's Supreme Electoral Council.</p>
<p>"We had pledged there would be transparent elections and that is what has happened," he said Monday. "I think there were enough observers who witnessed that."</p>
<p>A monitoring team named by US President George W. Bush said it had received reports of anomalies, citing the late opening and premature closing of some polling stations, and the slow vote count.</p>
<p>The team said it was unable to make an immediate assessment of "the impartiality and transparency of the process."</p>
<p>The monitoring mission was headed by US ambassador to Nicaragua, Paul Trivelli, who had been outspoken in warning Nicaraguans that failure to defeat Ortega could affect bilateral ties.</p>
<p>Ortega has dramatically toned down his revolutionary rhetoric, picked a former Contra as a running mate, and vowed he would strengthen democracy and battle poverty through "peace, love and unity." </p>

<p>But Washington still views him as a dangerous leftist with close ties to Cuba and Venezuela.</p>
<p>Trivelli called him "a tiger who has not changed his stripes" and claimed an Ortega victory would lead to "the introduction of a Chavez model" in Nicaragua.</p>
<p>Chavez has delivered cheap fuel to the energy-starved Central American country through mayors of the Sandinista party, and said more would be forthcoming under an Ortega government.</p>
<p>At the same time, Venezuela has repeatedly lashed out at the Bush administration, claiming it was interfering in Nicaragua's affairs.</p>
<p>Several voters interviewed in Managua also criticized the United States, and were particularly angry over calls by some US lawmakers to block remittances sent by Nicaraguans living in the United States, a critical source of funds in this country of 5.4 million people, where almost half the population lives in poverty.</p>
<p>"The 'gringos' have no business here," said construction worker Antonio Castellon, 49, pointing to the Managua polling station where he cast his ballot.</p>
<p>"We know what we need: peace, unity, rice and beans," he said.</p>
<p>Nicaraguans also voted to renew the 91-member unicameral Congress, which currently includes 40 deputies of Rizo's Liberal Constitutionalist Party, 38 Sandinistas and nine members from Montealegre's National Liberal Alliance.</p>
