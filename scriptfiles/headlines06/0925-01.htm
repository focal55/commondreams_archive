<p>Author Noam Chomsky's &quot;<i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0805076883?tag=commondreams-20/ref=nosim/" target="_new">Hegemony or Survival: America's Quest for Global Dominance</a></i>&quot; remained perched atop of Amazon.com's bestseller list, after its plug last week by Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez during a fiery UN speech condemning US President George W. Bush.</p>

    The popular online company showed the 2003 book still as its biggest seller, after having claimed the top spot Friday following Chavez recommendation of it as &quot;an excellent book to help us understand what has been happening in the world throughout the 20th century ... and the greatest threat looming over our planet.&quot;</p>
<p>

News reports said the book, published in 2003, leapt from 26,000 to number one following <a href="http://www.commondreams.org/views06/0920-22.htm">Chavez's headline-making speech</a> in which he railed against US &quot;imperialism,&quot; saying &quot;the hegemonic pretensions of the American empire are placing at risk the very survival of the human species.&quot;</p>

<p>

&quot;<i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0805076883?tag=commondreams-20/ref=nosim/" target="_new">Hegemony or Survival</a></i>&quot; dislodged the earlier number one by New York Times columnist Frank Rich &quot;<i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/159420098X?tag=commondreams-20/ref=nosim/" target="_new">The Greatest Story Ever Sold: The Decline and Fall of Truth from 9/11 to Katrina</a></i>.&quot;</p>
<p>

&quot;I hate the guy. Forget about geopolitics,&quot; Rich joked Sunday speaking on US television, when asked about being bumped from the top book sales spot.</p>
<p>

Chomsky, 77, told to the New York Times last week that he would be &quot;happy to meet&quot; Chavez.</p>

<p>

A linguistics scholar and longtime critic of US foreign policy, he told the daily he is &quot;quite interested&quot; in Chavez's policies and finds many of his views &quot;quite constructive.&quot;</p>
