The move by Major Gen. Geoffrey Miller is the first time he has indicated he might have information that could implicate him in wrongdoing, the newspaper said, citing military lawyers. Invoking the right does not legally imply guilt it said.</p><p>It said the action came shortly after the commanding officer at Abu Ghraib, Col. Thomas Pappas, accepted immunity this week and was ordered to testify at upcoming courts martial.</p><p>Miller once supervised the jail for foreign terrorism suspects at the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. He helped introduce Guantanamo-style questioning methods in Iraq ahead of the 2003 abuse scandal at Abu Ghraib prison near Baghdad.</p><p>Harvey Volzer, an attorney for one of two solders accused of using dogs to intimate prisoners at Abu Ghraib, wanted to question Miller about whether he ordered the use of dogs during interrogations, the Post said.</p><p>Miller invoked his right against self-incrimination through his Army lawyer on Tuesday after a military judge ruled that lawyers representing the dog handlers could interview the general this week, the article said.</p><p>Miller's lawyer, Maj. Michelle Crawford, was quoted as saying that the general decided not to answer more questions because he has "been interviewed repeatedly over the last several years" about his role at Guantanamo Bay and his visit to Iraq in 2003, the newspaper reported.</p><p>Seven low-ranking military police have taken most of the blame for abuses at Abu Ghraib, the newspaper said. No high-raking officers have faced criminal charges.</p><p>In an interview with defense attorneys for those MPs in August 2004, Miller said he never told Pappas to use dogs in questioning detainees, the Post said.</p>
<p>The United States has faced sharp criticism from rights groups and foreign governments over its treatment of prisoners in its declared war on terrorism and in the war in Iraq, because of reports of abuse of detainees at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba and at Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq.</p>
