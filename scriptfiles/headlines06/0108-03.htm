<p>WASHINGTON -- A majority of Americans want the Bush administration to get court approval before eavesdropping on people inside the United States, even if those calls might involve suspected terrorists, an AP-Ipsos poll shows.

        <!--/endimage/--> In the last three weeks, President Bush and top aides have defended the electronic monitoring program they secretly launched shortly after Sept. 11 as a vital tool to protect the nation.

<p>Yet 56 percent of respondents in an AP-Ipsos poll said the government should be required to first get a court warrant to eavesdrop on the overseas calls and e-mails of U.S. citizens when the communications are thought to be tied to terrorism.

<p>Agreeing with the White House, about 42 percent of those surveyed do not think the court approval is necessary.

<p>''We're at war,'' Bush said during a New Year's Day visit to San Antonio. ''And as commander in chief, I've got to use the resources at my disposal, within the law, to protect the American people. . . . It's a vital, necessary program.''

<p><b>'We're a nation of laws'
</b>
<p>According to the poll, age matters in how people view the monitoring. Nearly two-thirds of those between 18 and 29 think warrants should be required, while people 65 and older are evenly divided.

<p>Party affiliation is a factor, too. Almost three-fourths of Democrats and one-third of Republicans want to require court warrants.

<p>Cynthia Ice-Bones, 32, a Republican from Sacramento, Calif., said knowing about the program made her feel a bit safer. ''I think our security is so important that we don't need warrants,'' she said.

<p>Peter Ahr of Caldwell, N.J., said he could not find a justification for skipping judicial approvals. Nor did he believe the administration's argument that such a step would impair terrorism investigations.

<p>''We're a nation of laws. . . . That means that everybody has to live by the law, including the administration,'' said Ahr, 64, a Democrat. ''For the administration to simply go after wiretaps on their own without anyone else's say-so is a violation of that principle.''

<p>The poll, conducted Tuesday through Thursday, was based on phone interviews with 1,001 adults. The margin of error is plus or minus 3 percentage points.</p>
