        <!--/endimage/--> The call comes after U.S. military officials admitted that they had mistakenly bombed a civilian residence in the northern Iraqi town of Baiji over a week ago. The air raid that killed at least six people in their home prompted widespread anger among local communities.</p>
<p>"When mistakes happen, we have a responsibility to help the victims and their loved ones," said Sarah Holewinsky, director of the Washington, D.C.-based <a href="http://www.civicworldwide.org">Campaign for Innocent Civilians in Conflict (CIVIC)</a>.</p>
<p>The raid was conducted after seeing three men suspected of planting a roadside bomb near the house, U.S. officials told reporters after the incident. They said the suspected men were assessed as a threat to civilians and military forces.</p>
<p>U.S. officials on the ground have discretionary powers to compensate innocent people who have suffered losses as a result of U.S. actions, including the family members of those killed, CIVIC said in a statement released this week.</p>
<p>The group urged a thorough investigation of the Baiji incident so that assistance can be provided to surviving family members, citing a $38 million fund created by the U.S. Congress in 2003 to help civilian victims of war in Iraq and Afghanistan and named after CIVIC's late founder, <a href="http://www.commondreams.org/views05/0421-31.htm">Marla Ruzicka</a>, who was killed in a suicide bombing in Iraq last April.</p>
<p>Estimates of the total war-related civilian deaths in Iraq remain controversial because there is no official account by the U.S. military.</p>
<p>Surveys conducted by independent groups, however, suggest that tens of thousands of Iraqis have been killed since the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in March 2003.</p>

<p>The UK-based Iraqi Body Count (IBC), an independent group of peace activists and academics, estimates that at least 25,000 civilian deaths are directly related to the U.S.-led war in Iraq.</p>
<p>A team of U.S. and Iraqi public health researchers estimated in October 2004 that by that time, 100,000 Iraqi civilians had died who otherwise would not have. The group, who published their results in the British medical journal, the Lancet, went door-to-door in Iraq to compare death rates before and during the war. </p>
<p>While IBC would like to see an independent commission set up in Iraq to give an accurate estimate of Iraqi deaths, Holewinski's group says it wants this task to be taken up by the U.S. government.</p>
<p>Mindful that the U.S. military increasingly relies on aerial bombing, the group believes that maintaining a record of incidents of air strikes could enhance efforts to prevent innocent casualties as well.</p>
<p>"Keeping as accurate a record as possible and compensating victims is important for the U.S. to maintain the respect and support of the Iraqi people," Holewinski said.</p>
<p>Like CIVIC, other groups have not merely expressed their concern over the loss of innocent Iraqi lives, but have scathingly criticized the way the Pentagon has conducted the war operations in Iraq.</p>
<p>Last year the New York-based <a href="http://www.hrw.org">Human Rights Watch</a> released a report deploring the U.S. military for resorting to indiscriminate aerial strikes. It accused the U.S. of "imprecise targeting" of strikes against Saddam loyalists.</p>
<p>Out of 50 so-called "decapitation strikes" against members of Saddam Hussein's regime, none were hit, the group said, but 40 civilians were killed because planners relied on rough Global Positioning System locations derived from satellite phones.</p>

<p>"Any attacking force has a duty to do this kind of analysis," HRW director Kenneth Roth told the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) in an interview after releasing the report.
<p>
"What is amazing is that the U.S. does nothing of that sort," he added.
<p>
Also, this week, the U.S. came under heavy fire for its military behavior in Iraq from no less close an ally in the battlefield than a senior British official.
<p>
"(U.S.) officers displayed cultural ignorance, self-righteousness, overoptimism and unproductive management," Brigadier Nigel Aylwin-Foster said in an article published by the U.S. Army's Military Review magazine.
<p>
The British officer accused the U.S. military of using tactics earlier during the occupation that alienated Iraqis, saying that officers displayed such cultural insensitivity that it "arguably amounted to institutional racism."
<p>
CIVIC and some other non-governmental organizations are not quite so disapproving of U.S. tactics.
<p>
"The U.S. military deserves credit for the considerable efforts it makes to avoid harming civilians," said Holewinski, while stressing the need for an independent probe into the Baiji incident to ensure fair compensation for those affected.</p>
