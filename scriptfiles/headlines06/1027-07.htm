<p>A new poll shows support for the war in
Iraq is slipping among white evangelical Protestants,
previously a key pillar of support for President George W.
Bush's conduct of the conflict.</p>
<p>The poll is the latest bad domestic news for Bush and the
Republicans about Iraq with just 12 days to go to congressional
elections in which the Democrats are widely expected to capture
control of the House of Representatives.</p>
<p>Conducted by the PEW Research Center, it found that 58
percent of white evangelical Protestants surveyed felt the
United States made the right decision in using force in Iraq to
oust Saddam Hussein, below the 71 percent in a previous poll in
September.</p>
<p>This compared to little change overall among committed
Republicans, with 78 percent saying it was the correct course
versus 76 percent in September.</p>
<p>Flagging public support for the war as the death toll among
U.S. forces mount in Iraq is one of the main reasons why
analysts see Republicans losing House seats on November 7.</p>
<p>Political activists in the evangelical community have been
unwavering supporters of the war they see in part as a broader
"clash of civilizations." Distaste among their flock for the
conflict therefore highlights the depth of its unpopularity.</p>
<p>Scott Keeter of the PEW Research Center said it was hard to
say why evangelical support seemed to have fallen so sharply
but geography could be one reason.</p>
<p>"Many evangelicals are in the South and the military
presence there is quite large and so the impact of the war on
local communities is probably greater there," he said.</p>
<p>The PEW poll also found that only 48 percent of white
evangelical Protestants now thought the war effort was going
very or fairly well, versus 61 percent in September.</p>

<p>The latest poll was conducted nationwide from October 17 to
22. It also found that nationally the Democrats hold a
double-digit lead over Republicans heading into the elections.</p>
<p>LEADERS STILL BACK BUSH</p>
<p>Christian conservative leaders still stand behind the
president though more moderate denominations have expressed
doubts about or opposition to the war.</p>
<p>In his October newsletter, James Dobson of the conservative
advocacy group Focus on the Family offered staunch support for
the president on Iraq and the wider war on terror.</p>
<p>"For the first time in the 29-year history of this
ministry, I feel I must address the burgeoning threat posed by
Islamic fundamentalism," he wrote.</p>
<p>"When it comes to the threat of terror, he (President Bush)
gets it," he said. "Mr. Bush has been subjected to incredible
criticism, much of it unfair and vicious, for his prosecution
of this war. I admire him for standing firm."</p>
<p>Analysts say much of the evangelical leadership has little
choice but to stick by the president and the Republicans
because they have demonized Democrats and have nowhere else to
go.</p>
<p>"Christian conservative leaders who are aligned with the
Republican Party are stuck and so they are going to back Bush
on the war," said David Bositis of the Joint Center for
Political and Economic Studies.</p>
<p>Jerry Cox, executive director of the conservative Arkansas
Family Council, said he felt people just wanted to get the job
in Iraq done.

<p>
"They just want the war to hurry up and be over with. They
view it as just a tough job that needs to be done," he told
Reuters by telephone.
