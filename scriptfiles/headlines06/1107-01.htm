"As a patriotic American proud to serve the nation in uniform, I respectfully urge my political leaders in Congress to support the prompt withdrawal of all American military forces and bases from Iraq," the petition says.</p>
<p>"Staying in Iraq will not work and is not worth the price. It is time for US troops to come home," it says.</p>
<p>The campaign's website, www.appealforredress.org, says the petition is sponsored by active duty service members based in the Norfolk, Virginia area and by a sponsoring committee of veterans and military family members.</p>
<p>The committee includes Iraq Veterans against the War (IVAW), Veterans for Peace (VFP) and Military Families Speak Out.</p>
<p>"Many active duty, reserve, and guard service members are concerned about the war in Iraq and support the withdrawal of US troops," the website says.</p>
<p>"The Appeal for Redress provides a way in which individual service members can appeal to their congressional representative and US senators to urge an end to the US military occupation," it says.</p>
<p>One of the campaign's activists told AFP hundreds of soldiers have signed the petition.</p>
<p>According to a local newspaper, the Virginian-Pilot, the petition's leader is Jonathan Hutto, a sailor on the Norfolk-based aircraft carrier Theodore Roosevelt. His website was activated in October, the daily said.</p>
<p>Iraq is the central theme of Tuesday's US congressional election, in which opposition Democrats hope to take control of Congress from President George W. Bush's Republicans.</p>
