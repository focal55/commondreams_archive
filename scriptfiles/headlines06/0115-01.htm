<p>WASHINGTON -- Most Americans believe there has been significant progress in achieving Martin Luther King Jr.'s dream of racial equality, though blacks are more skeptical, an AP-Ipsos poll indicates.

        <!--/endimage/--> Racial integration has swept across much of American life, and blacks have gained economic ground since the height of the civil rights movement.

<p>Two decades ago, the government established a federal holiday in honor of the slain civil rights leader.

<p>On some measures such as annual income, blacks have closed the gap considerably with whites, census figures show. The progress for blacks may have stalled, however, and some even fear a possible backlash.

<p>''Progress has always been stop-and-start, and sometimes back up," said Julian Bond, national chairman of the NAACP. ''We're in a holding pattern right now."

<p>Three-quarters of those surveyed say there has been significant progress on achieving King's dream. But only 66 percent of blacks felt that way.

<p>''At times I have felt that we've made progress," said Aubrey Jones, a black deputy warden at a state prison near Macon, Ga. ''At other times, I feel we're at a standstill, especially when you come across instances of individuals being prejudiced."

<p>Only 23 percent of respondents said they will do anything to commemorate the national holiday that took effect in 1986 after a lengthy campaign in Congress to honor King. A solid majority of blacks, 60 percent, say they will get involved in holiday activities.

<p>Some say the civil rights movement sparked a backlash that could reverse gains. Among those concerns are efforts to require a voter ID card in Georgia; the fight over the confirmation of conservative Judge Samuel Alito to be on the Supreme Court; immigration's effect on the job market for blacks; and an expected fight next year over reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act.

<p>''Politically, the group that has gained the most after the civil rights movement was white Southern conservatives," Bositis said. ''They have transformed the Republican Party, which has become the dominant political party."

<p>All 50 states gradually recognized a King holiday. But only one-third of businesses offer a paid holiday, according to the Bureau of National Affairs.

<p>Participation in the holiday was enhanced by legislation passed in 1994 establishing the day as one of service. Supporters of the holiday try to discourage businesses from using it as a marketing gimmick.

<p>''Martin Luther King would turn over in his grave if he thought he was recognized by a day of shopping and rest," said former Senator Harris Wofford, a Pennsylvania Democrat, who worked with Georgia Representative John Lewis to establish the holiday as a day of service.

<p>''The idea that it's a day on and not a day off is catching on. But the King holiday is well short of what it needs to be," Wofford said.
