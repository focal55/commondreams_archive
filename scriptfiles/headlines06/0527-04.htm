<p> Venezuelan President Hugo
Chavez pledged &#36;1.5 billion in energy investments in
impoverished Bolivia on Friday, receiving a hero's welcome from
coca farmers who applauded his anti-U.S. message.</p>

Shouts of "Viva Venezuela!" rang out as Chavez, clad in an
Andean-style red poncho and wool hat, spoke in Shinahota, a
dusty town in the coca-growing Chapare region some 370 miles
southeast of La Paz.</p>
<p>Chavez's investment promises marked his latest effort to
spread his oil largess -- Venezuela is the world's fifth
largest crude exporter -- and boost his political influence
across Latin America with moves that have included offering
neighbors cut-rate oil deals and offers to buy their debt.</p>
<p>Chavez addressed the crowd flanked by leftist allies
Bolivian President Evo Morales and Cuban Vice President Carlos
Lage and used the occasion to denounce President Bush, saying
he had "given the green light to conspire against the Bolivian
democracy."</p>
<p>Bush said earlier this week he was concerned about "the
erosion of democracy" in both Bolivia and Venezuela.</p>
<p>Morales, a former coca farmer, has formed close ties with
Chavez since being elected in December.</p>
<p>"Bolivia has found its path because the Bolivian people
have found the leader they were lacking," said Chavez,
congratulating Morales on his May 1 decision to put Bolivia's
energy industry in state hands.</p>
<p>Venezuelan Energy Minister Rafael Ramirez said his
country's state-owned oil company, PDVSA, was investing in
exploration and production projects in Bolivia, South America's
poorest country.</p>

<p>Later in the city of La Paz, Ramirez signed deals with
Bolivia's state-owned energy company YPFB that include building
two gas-processing plants as well as exploring for new natural
gas reserves.</p>
<p>COCA A KEY ISSUE</p>
<p>The choice of Bolivia's tropical Chapare region for the
start of the Venezuelan president's visit was symbolic.</p>
<p>Support for Morales is strong in Chapare, where for years
he grew coca and led sometimes violent protests against
U.S.-funded coca eradication programs. Coca is the main
ingredient for cocaine but is also traditionally grown to make
tea and for medicinal purposes.</p>
<p>Venezuela plans to aid Bolivia in creating jobs by funding
projects to produce organic tea, coffee, dairy and legal coca
products. Chavez also donated computers to schools in Chapare.</p>
<p>"Our three nations are talking about industrializing the
coca leaf," Morales said, referring to Bolivia, Cuba and
Venezuela. "We want to tell the whole world coca is not cocaine
and we're going to industrialize it for the good of humanity."</p>
<p>Bolivia is the world's third-largest cocaine producer after
Colombia and Peru and Morales has vowed to seek legal uses for
the plant as a way to fight cocaine trafficking and protect the
livelihoods of peasant growers.</p>
<p>Chavez is popular among the poor majority that forms
Morales' support base, although some sectors of the Bolivian
opposition are wary of his influence.</p>
<p>Rightist opposition leader Jorge Quiroga told reporters on
Thursday Morales was becoming Chavez's "puppet."</p>

<p>Bolivia has South America's second-largest natural gas
reserves after Venezuela and the government is keen to attract
new investment in that sector, especially in exploration.
<p>
Venezuelan aid to Bolivia has increased since Morales came
to office but the Washington remains Bolivia's biggest aid
donor. U.S. aid in Chapare is focused on eradicating coca and
encouraging alternative crops such as bananas and pineapples.</p><p align="center">&copy; Copyright 2006 Reuters</p>
