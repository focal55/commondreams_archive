<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><P>The true stories of how American troops, killed in Iraq, actually died keep spilling out this week. On Tuesday, we <a href="http://www.editorandpublisher.com/eandp/columns/pressingissues_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003317039" target="_blank"><u>explored</u></a> the case of Kenny Stanton, Jr., murdered last month by our allies, the Iraqi police, though the military didn&rsquo;t make that known at the time. Now we learn that one of the first female soldiers killed in Iraq died by her own hand after objecting to interrogation techniques used on prisoners.<br clear="none">

<br clear="none">
She was Army specialist Alyssa Peterson, 27, a Flagstaff, Az., native serving with C Company, 311th Military Intelligence BN, 101st Airborne. Peterson was an Arabic-speaking interrogator assigned to the prison at our air base in troubled Tal-Afar in northwestern Iraq. According to official records, she died on Sept. 15, 2003, from a &ldquo;non-hostile weapons discharge.&rdquo;<br clear="none">
<br clear="none">

She was only the third American woman killed in Iraq so her death drew wide press attention. A &ldquo;non-hostile weapons discharge&rdquo; leading to death is not unusual in Iraq, often quite accidental, so this one apparently raised few eyebrows. The Arizona Republic, three days after her death, reported that Army officials &ldquo;said that a number of possible scenarios are being considered, including Peterson's own weapon discharging, the weapon of another soldier discharging or the accidental shooting of Peterson by an Iraqi civilian.&rdquo;<br clear="none">
<br clear="none">
But in this case, a longtime radio and newspaper reporter named Kevin Elston, unsatisfied with the public story, decided to probe deeper in 2005, "just on a hunch," he told E&P today. He made "hundreds of phone calls" to the military and couldn't get anywhere, so he filed a Freedom of Information Act request. When the documents of the official investigation of her death arrived, they contained bombshell revelations. Here&rsquo;s what the Flagstaff public radio station, KNAU, where Elston now works, reported yesterday:<br clear="none">

<br clear="none">
&ldquo;Peterson objected to the interrogation techniques used on prisoners. She refused to participate after only two nights working in the unit known as the cage. Army spokespersons for her unit have refused to describe the interrogation techniques Alyssa objected to. They say all records of those techniques have now been destroyed&hellip.&rdquo;<br clear="none">
<br clear="none">
She was was then assigned to the base gate, where she monitored Iraqi guards, and sent to suicide prevention training. &ldquo;But on the night of September 15th, 2003, Army investigators concluded she shot and killed herself with her service rifle,&rdquo; the documents disclose.<br clear="none">
<br clear="none">
The Army talked to some of Peterson's colleagues. Asked to summarize their comments, Elston told E&P: "The reactions to the suicide were that she was having a difficult time separating her personal feelings from her professional duties. That was the consistent point in the testimonies, that she objected to the interrogation techniques, without describing what those techniques were."<br clear="none">
<br clear="none">
Elston said that the documents also refer to a suicide note found on her body, revealing that she found it ironic that suicide prevention training had taught her how to commit suicide. He has now filed another FOIA request for a copy of the actual note.<br clear="none">

<br clear="none">
Peterson's father, Rich Peterson, has said: &ldquo;Alyssa volunteered to change assignments with someone who did not want to go to Iraq.&rdquo;<br clear="none">
<br clear="none">
Alyssa Peterson, a devout Mormon, had graduated from Flagstaff High School and earned a psychology degree from Northern Arizona University on a military scholarship. She was trained in interrogation techniques at Fort Huachuca in Arizona, and then sent to the Middle East in 2003.<br clear="none">
<br clear="none">
The Arizona Republic article had opened: &ldquo;Friends say Army Spc. Alyssa R. Peterson of Flagstaff always had an amazing ability to learn foreign languages.<br clear="none">
<br clear="none">
&ldquo;Peterson became fluent in Dutch even before she went on an 18-month Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints mission to the Netherlands in the late 1990s. Then, she cruised through her Arabic courses at the military's Defense Language Institute in Monterey, Calif., shortly after enlisting in July 2001.<br clear="none">
<br clear="none">
&ldquo;With that under her belt, she was off to Iraq to conduct interrogations and translate enemy documents.&rdquo;<br clear="none">

<br clear="none">
On a &ldquo;fallen heroes&rdquo; message board on the Web, Mary W. Black of Flagstaff wrote, "The very day Alyssa died, her Father was talking to me at the Post Office where we both work, in Flagstaff, Az., telling me he had a premonition and was very worried about his daughter who was in the military on the other side of the world. The next day he was notified while on the job by two army officers. Never has a daughter been so missed or so loved than she was and has been by her Father since that fateful September day in 2003. He has been the most broken man I have ever seen.&rdquo;<br clear="none">
<br clear="none">
An A.W. from Los Angeles wrote: "I met Alyssa only once during a weekend surfing trip while she was at DLI. Although our encounter was brief, she made a lasting impression. We did not know each other well, but I was blown away by her genuine, sincere, sweet nature. I don&rsquo;t know how else to put it-- she was just nice.&hellip.I was devastated to here of her death. I couldn&rsquo;t understand why it had to happen to such a wonderful person.&rdquo;<br clear="none">
<br clear="none">
Finally, Daryl K. Tabor of Ashland City, Tenn., who had met her as a journalist in Iraq for the Kentucky New Era paper in Hopkinsville: "Since learning of her death, I cannot get the image of the last time I saw her out of my mind. We were walking out of the tent in Kuwait to be briefed on our flights into Iraq as I stepped aside to let her out first. Her smile was brighter than the hot desert sun. Peterson was the only soldier I interacted with that I know died in Iraq. I am truly sorry I had to know any."<p align="center"> &copy; 2006 VNU eMedia Inc. </p>
