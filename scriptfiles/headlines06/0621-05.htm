"It's like some sick power trip."<P><!--/beginimage/-->

        <!--/endimage/--> Spc Swift's decision to go public in her charges against three of her superiors is rare in the US military where veteran advocates say women risk retribution if they complain of harassment. But she joins a growing number of US troops who are refusing service in Iraq. Officially, the Pentagon says there are 4,400 troops absent without leave. Soldiers' advocates believe the true number is far higher.<P>Spc Swift joined their ranks on June 11 when she was arrested at her mother's home in Oregon five months after her unit left for Iraq. She was returned to Fort Lewis, Washington, where she could face desertion charges. Her sexual harassment complaints are part of the investigation.<P>The soldier says the mistreatment began soon after she enlisted at 19, lulled by the assurances of her recruiters that she would never find herself in a war zone. Less than a year later, she was on her way to Kerbala, in southern Iraq, one of three women in her company.<P>Soon after her arrival in Kuwait in February 2004, Spc Swift said, she was propositioned, and the harassment became unrelenting.<P>Since the eve of the invasion of Iraq in 2003, some 508 women serving in the military have complained of sexual assault, says the Miles Foundation, a private advocacy group. "Sexual harassment and sexual assault is an epidemic in the army," said Larry Hildes, Spc Swift's lawyer.<P>Spc Swift says she reported the harassment to the unit's equal opportunities officer and no action was taken. She later began a sexual relationship with a superior. Spc Swift now says that that relationship, which lasted three months, was coerced, and that she was threatened with being sent on dangerous assignments. "They have absolute power of life and death," she said. "If someone has to run across a minefield, and they don't like you, guess where you are going."<P>Spc Swift did not report the harassment. The two were assigned to different units when they returned to Fort Lewis in February last year. A week later, she asked another superior where to report for duty. She says he replied: "In my bed, naked." She filed a complaint, and was treated, her mother says, like a "traitor".
