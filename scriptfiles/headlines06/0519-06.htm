The network quoted law enforcement officials as saying the
Federal Bureau of Investigation was investigating allegations
that Gen. Michael Moseley and Gen. John Jumper helped to steer
a Thunderbird contract to a friend, retired Air Force Gen. Hal
Hornburg.</p>
<p>The Air Force, responding to the report, said Air Force
Secretary Michael Wynne had referred a protest involving the
contract to the Defense Department's chief internal inspector.</p>
<p>"Unfortunately, because of the ongoing litigation and
investigation it is inappropriate to address specifics
concerning the issue," an Air Force statement said.</p>
<p>Spokesmen for Moseley did not return phone calls seeking
comment and ABC said the three generals concerned denied any
wrongdoing. As a matter of policy, the Defense Department would
not confirm or deny whether such an investigation was under
way, said Army Lt. Col. Brian Maka, a Pentagon spokesman.</p>
<p>The Air Force's reputation has been tarnished by a scandal
that sent Darleen Druyun, its former second-ranking weapons
buyer, to federal prison for nine months for breaching
conflict-of-interest rules.</p>
<p>Air Force Secretary James Roche and acquisition chief
Marvin Sambur resigned in fallout from the scandal, which led
lawmakers to kill a &#36;23.5 billion plan to acquire Boeing Co.
tankers in 2004.</p>
<p>ABC said Hornburg, whose command included the Thunderbirds,
became a partner in the company that won the contract six
months after he retired from the military.</p>

<p>The FBI investigation began after complaints from Air Force
insiders and a rival company whose bid was for half the amount,
the network said.</p>
<p>The contract was canceled earlier this year when the Air
Force General Counsel questioned the "integrity of the process"
and the involvement of four-star generals, ABC said.</p>
<p>The case was referred to the Inspector General for the
Department of Defense, and the FBI later joined the
investigation, it said.
