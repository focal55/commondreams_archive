<p>The Archbishop of York, Dr John Sentamu, has launched a passionate attack on President George Bush, saying his administration's refusal to close the notorious Guantanamo Bay camp reflected "a society that is heading towards George Orwell's Animal Farm". </p>

        
          
          
            <p>
  Dr Sentamu, the Church of England's second in command, urged the UN Human 
  Rights Commission (UNHRC) to take legal action against the US - through the 
  US courts or the International Court of Justice at The Hague - should it 
  fail to respond to a report, by five UN inspectors, advising that Camp Delta 
  at Guantanamo Bay should be shut immediately because prisoners there are 
  being tortured.
</p>
<p>
  The report was published on Thursday, as a senior High Court judge, Mr 
  Justice Collins, stated that American actions over Guantanamo's Camp Delta 
  do not "appear to coincide with that of most civilised nations". 
  As a result of his ruling, three of eight British inmates held in the camp 
  are to appeal to the Foreign Secretary Jack Straw to intervene with the Bush 
  administration on their behalf.
</p>
<p>
  Archbishop Sentamu's comments will strengthen the increasingly insistent 
  international pressure for Guantanamo to be closed. Archbishop Desmond Tutu 
  called for its closure, after similar appeals by Peter Hain, the Northern 
  Ireland Secretary, and the UN secretary general Kofi Annan.

</p>
<p>
  Dr Sentamu said the UNHRC should seek a writ of habeas corpus, compelling 
  the US to bring those being detained at Guantanamo to court, to establish 
  whether they are imprisoned lawfully and if they should be released.
</p>
<p>
   "The American Government is breaking international law," he told 
  The Independent. "The main building block of a democratic society is 
  that everyone is equal before the law, innocent until proved otherwise, and 
  has the right to legal representation. If the guilt of the prisoners in 
  Guantanamo Bay is beyond doubt, why are the Americans afraid to bring them 
  to trial? Transparency and accountability are the other side of the coin of 
  freedom and responsibility. We are all accountable for our actions in spite 
  of circumstances. The events of 9/11 cannot erase the rule of law and 
  international obligations. 
</p>
<p>
   "The US should try all 500 detainees at Guantanamo, who still include 
  eight British residents, or free them without further delay. To hold someone 
  for up to four years without charge clearly indicates a society that is 
  heading towards George Orwell's Animal Farm."
</p>
<p>
  The Government has already managed to secure the release, in March 2004, of 
  the four British nationals who were detained at Guantanamo &shy; Moazzam Begg, 
  Feroz Abbasi, Martin Mubanga and Richard Belmar &shy; although only after 
  guarantees they would be constantly monitored and face an investigation to 
  ascertain whether they can be charged in this country. 

</p>
<p>
  Washington had claimed all four were "enemy combatants" who 
  trained at camps run by al-Qa'ida. But they were released after UK police 
  concluded there was not enough evidence to charge them with any offence. The 
  men said they had been tortured at Guantanamo, allegations the US denied. 
</p>
<p>
  So far the Prime Minister appears unmoved by the growing sense of 
  indignation brought on by the UNHRC report. He reiterated a statement first 
  made a year ago that the base in Cuba was "an anomaly". 
</p>
<p>
  Sir Menzies Campbell, the acting Liberal Democrat leader, said: "This 
  is not an anomaly which needs to be sorted sooner or later. This is an 
  outrage that needs to be sorted out now. Guantanamo Bay has damaged the 
  reputation of the US and its allies across the globe, and particularly in 
  the Middle East." 
</p>
<p>
  The Attorney General, Lord Goldsmith, told the BBC the military tribunals 
  proposed by Washington to try detainees at the base did not amount to a fair 
  trial "by standards we would regard as acceptable". But last 
  night, Donald Rumsfeld, the US Defence Secretary, rejected Mr Annan's calls. 
</p>

<p>
   "He's just flat wrong. We shouldn't close Guantanamo," he said. "
We have several hundred terrorists, bad people, people who if they went back 
  out on the field would try to kill Americans ... To close that place and 
  pretend that really there's no problem just isn't realistic."
