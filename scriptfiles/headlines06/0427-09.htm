A congressional subcommittee voted Wednesday to approve a measure that 
could dramatically increase spending on a controversial program to manufacture 
new generations of replacement nuclear warheads.

In a little-noticed section of a larger defense spending measure, the 
House Strategic Forces Subcommittee said that if the Department of Defense 
decides to delay an expensive program for refurbishing an existing cruise 
missile warhead, known as the W-80, the money should be diverted to what is 
known as the Reliable Replacement Warhead program. 
<P>The amount could mark a substantial increase for the controversial 
program.  
<P>Congress authorized $25 million last year for the RRW, which is in its 
earliest design phase.  
<P>According to congressional staffers, the amount of money eligible to be 
diverted from the W-80 warhead amounts to approximately $27 million, which 
would instantly double the budget for the future program. 
<P>Advocacy groups say the amount could go higher. Jay Coghlan, director of 
Nuclear Watch of New Mexico, an arms control group, said there is $102 million 
in this year's budget for the refurbishment of the W-80, and an additional $480 
million is expected to be spent over the next three years. 
<P>Most of the weapons in the U.S. nuclear weapons stockpile, built during 
the Cold War, are 30 years old or more. The Bush administration has said that 
they are and will remain for years in perfect working order. But the 
administration has said the cost of maintaining the aging weapons and 
uncertainty over their future effectiveness requires the production of a new 
generation of warheads. The new weapons would be more reliable, safer, easier 
to build and easier to maintain, administration officials say. 
<P>But critics, many of them scientists with long experience working on 
nuclear weapons issues, argue that the current weapons will remain usable for 
decades, that the RRW program is wasteful and expensive, and that it would send 
the wrong message at a time when the United States is struggling to prevent 
other countries from producing nuclear weapons. 

<P>The transfer of funds to the RRW program would be contingent on a 
Department of Defense decision to delay the refurbishment of the W-80 warhead. 
Sources close to the Pentagon said a debate has been raging on whether such 
refurbishment is needed.  
<P>Analysts said Wednesday's vote indicates that there is growing sentiment 
in Congress to push ahead on restarting nuclear weapons production for the 
first time since the 1980s, when the United States shut down most of its 
weapons manufacturing sites.  
<P>Rep. Ellen Tauscher, D-Walnut Creek, a member of the subcommittee, called 
the vote "a sound one that allows for a better allocation and preservation of 
the resources that are available to us."
