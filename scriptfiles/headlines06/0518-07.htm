<p>WASHINGTON --


The National Security Agency developed a pilot program 
in the late 1990s that would have enabled it to gather and analyze 
massive amounts of communications data without running afoul of privacy 
laws. But after the Sept. 11 attacks, it shelved the project -- not 
because it failed to work -- but because of bureaucratic infighting and 
a sudden White House expansion of the agency's surveillance powers, 
according to several intelligence officials.<br>

<br>
The agency opted instead to adopt only one component of the program, 
which produced a far less capable and rigorous program. It remains the 
backbone of the NSA's warrantless surveillance efforts, tracking 
domestic and overseas communications from a vast databank of 
information, and monitoring selected calls.<br>
<br>
Four intelligence officials knowledgeable about the program agreed to 
discuss it with <i>The Sun</i> only if granted anonymity because of the 
sensitivity of the subject.<br>
<br>
The program the NSA rejected, called ThinThread, was developed to handle 
greater volumes of information, partly in expectation of threats 
surrounding the millennium celebrations. Sources say it bundled together 
four cutting-edge surveillance tools. ThinThread would have:<br>
<br>
* Used more sophisticated methods of sorting through massive phone and 
e-mail data to identify suspect communications.<br>
<br>
* Identified U.S. phone numbers and other communications data and 
encrypted them to ensure caller privacy.<br>

<br>
* Employed an automated auditing system to monitor how analysts handled 
the information, in order to prevent misuse and improve efficiency.<br>
<br>
* Analyzed the data to identify relationships between callers and 
chronicle their contacts. Only when evidence of a potential threat had 
been developed would analysts be able to request decryption of the records.<br>
<br>
An agency spokesman declined to discuss NSA operations.<br>
<br>
"Given the nature of the work we do, it would be irresponsible to 
discuss actual or alleged operational issues as it would give those 
wishing to do harm to the U.S. insight and potentially place Americans 
in danger," said NSA spokesman Don Weber in a statement to <i>The Sun</i><br>
<br>
"However, it is important to note that NSA takes its legal 
responsibilities very seriously and operates within the law."<br>
<br>

In what intelligence experts describe as rigorous testing of ThinThread 
in 1998, the project succeeded at each task with high marks. For 
example, its ability to sort through massive amounts of data to find 
threat-related communications far surpassed the existing system, sources 
said. It also was able to rapidly separate and encrypt U.S.-related 
communications to ensure privacy.<br>
<br>
But the NSA, then headed by Air Force Gen. Michael V. Hayden, opted 
against both of those tools, as well as the feature that monitored 
potential abuse of the records. Only the data analysis facet of the 
program survived and became the basis for the warrantless surveillance 
program.<br>
<br>
The decision, which one official attributed to "turf protection and 
empire building," has undermined the agency's ability to zero in on 
potential threats, sources say. In the wake of revelations about the 
agency's wide gathering of U.S. phone records, they add, ThinThread 
could have provided a simple solution to privacy concerns.<br>
<br>
A number of independent studies, including a classified 2004 report from 
the Pentagon's inspector-general, in addition to the successful pilot 
tests, found that the program provided "superior processing, filtering 
and protection of U.S. citizens, and discovery of important and 
previously unknown targets," said an intelligence official familiar with 
the program who described the reports to <i>The Sun</i>. The Pentagon 
report concluded that ThinThread's ability to sort through data in 2001 
was far superior to that of another NSA system in place in 2004, and 
that the program should be launched and enhanced.<br>
<br>
Hayden, the president's nominee to lead the CIA, is to appear Thursday 
before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence and is expected to 
face tough questioning about the warrantless surveillance program, the 
collection of domestic phone records and other NSA programs.<br>
<br>

While the furor over warrantless surveillance, particularly collection 
of domestic phone records, has raised questions about the legality of 
the program, there has been little or no discussion about how it might 
be altered to eliminate such concerns.<br>
<br>
ThinThread was designed to address two key challenges: The NSA had more 
information than it could digest, and, increasingly, its targets were in 
contact with people in the United States whose calls the agency was 
prohibited from monitoring.<br>
<br>
With the explosion of digital communications, especially phone calls 
over the Internet and the use of devices such as BlackBerries, the NSA 
was struggling to sort key nuggets of information from the huge volume 
of data it took in.<br>
<br>
By 1999, as some NSA officials grew increasingly concerned about 
millennium-related security, ThinThread seemed in position to become an 
important tool with which the NSA could prevent terrorist attacks. But 
it was never launched. Neither was it put into effect after the attacks 
in 2001. Despite its success in tests, ThinThread's information-sorting 
system was viewed by some in the agency as a competitor to Trailblazer, 
a $1.2 billion program that was being developed with similar goals. The 
NSA was committed to Trailblazer, which later ran into trouble and has 
been essentially abandoned.<br>
<br>
Both programs aimed to better sort through the sea of data to find key 
tips to the next terrorist attack, but Trailblazer had more political 
support internally because it was initiated by Hayden when he first 
arrived at the NSA, sources said.<br>
<br>
NSA managers did not want to adopt the data-sifting component of 
ThinThread out of fear that the Trailblazer program would be 
outperformed and "humiliated," an intelligence official said.<br>

<br>
Without ThinThread's data-sifting assets, the warrantless surveillance 
program was left with a sub-par tool for sniffing out information, and 
that has diminished the quality of its analysis, according to 
intelligence officials.<br>
<br>
Sources say the NSA's existing system for data-sorting has produced a 
database clogged with corrupted and useless information.<br>
<br>
The mass collection of relatively unsorted data, combined with system 
flaws that sources say erroneously flag people as suspect, has produced 
numerous false leads, draining analyst resources, according to two 
intelligence officials. FBI agents have complained in published reports 
in <i>The New York Times </i> that NSA leads have resulted in numerous dead 
ends.<br>
<br>
The privacy protections offered by ThinThread were also abandoned in the 
post-Sept. 11 push by the president for a faster response to terrorism.<br>
<br>
Once President Bush gave the go-ahead for the NSA to secretly gather and 
analyze domestic phone records -- an authorization that carried 
no stipulations about identity protection -- agency officials regarded 
the encryption as an unnecessary step and rejected it, according to two 
intelligence officials knowledgeable about ThinThread and the 
warrantless surveillance programs.<br>

<br>
"They basically just disabled the [privacy] safeguards," said one 
intelligence official.<br>
<br>
Another, a former top intelligence official, said that without a privacy 
requirement, "there was no reason to go back to something that was 
perhaps more difficult to implement."<br>
<br>
However two officials familiar with the program said the encryption 
feature would have been simple to implement. One said the time required 
would have involved minutes, not hours.<br>
<br>
Encryption would have required analysts to be more disciplined in their 
investigations, however, by forcing them to gather what a court would 
consider sufficient information to indicate possible terrorist activity 
before decryption could be authorized.<br>
<br>
While it is unclear why the agency dropped the component that monitored 
for abuse of records, one intelligence official noted that the feature 
was not popular with analysts. It not only tracked the use of the 
database, but hunted for the most effective analysis techniques, and 
some analysts thought it would be used to judge their performance.<br>
<br>
Within the NSA, the primary advocate for the ThinThread program was 
Richard Taylor, who headed the agency's operations division. Taylor who 
has retired from the NSA, did not return calls seeking comment.<br>

<br>
Officials say that after the successful tests of ThinThread in 1998, 
Taylor argued that the NSA should implement the full program. He later 
told the 9/11 Commission that ThinThread could have identified the 
hijackers had it been in place before the attacks, according to an 
intelligence expert close to the commission.<br>
<br>
But at the time, NSA lawyers viewed the program as too aggressive. At 
that point, the NSA's authority was limited strictly to overseas 
communications, with the FBI responsible for analyzing domestic calls. 
The lawyers feared that expanding NSA data collection to include 
communications in the United States could violate civil liberties, even 
with the encryption function.<br>
<br>
Taylor had an intense meeting with Hayden and NSA lawyers. "It was a 
very emotional debate," recalled a former intelligence official. 
"Eventually it was rejected by [NSA] lawyers."<br>
<br>
After the 2001 attacks, the NSA lawyers who had blocked the program 
reversed their position and approved the use of the program without the 
enhanced technology to sift out terrorist communications and without the 
encryption protections.<br>
<br>
The NSA's new legal analysis was based on the commander in chief's 
powers during war, said former officials familiar with the program. The 
Bush administration's defense has rested largely on that argument since 
the warrantless surveillance program became public in December.<br>
<br>
The strength of ThinThread's approach is that by encrypting information 
on Americans, it is legal regardless of whether the country is at war, 
according to one intelligence official.<br>

<br>
Officials familiar with Thin Thread say some within NSA were stunned by 
the legal flip-flop. ThinThread "was designed very carefully from a 
legal point of view, so that even in non-wartime, you could have done it 
legitimately," the official said.<br>
<br>
In a speech in January, Hayden said the warrantless surveillance program 
was not only limited to al-Qaida communications, but carefully 
implemented with an eye toward preserving the Constitution and rights of 
Americans.<br>
<br>
"As the director, I was the one responsible to ensure that this program 
was limited in its scope and disciplined in its application," he said.<p align="center">Copyright &copy; 2006, The Baltimore Sun</p>
