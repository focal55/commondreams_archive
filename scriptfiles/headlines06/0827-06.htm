<p> WASHINGTON --
President Bush vowed last week that he would never abandon his goal of 
creating democracy in Iraq, but outside the White House, the foreign policy 
world is wondering how to contain a civil war that could engulf the Middle 
East. 
<P>Even Bush acknowledged the debate. "If you think it's bad now, imagine 
what Iraq would look like if the United States leaves before the government can 
defend itself," he said Monday. 
<P>Analysts across the political spectrum say the Bush Doctrine  --  
preventive war, choking the roots of terrorism by planting democracy, and 
brandishing power to force others into line  --  has failed. Bush's lofty 
goals, shared even by his critics, have been set back, perhaps decades, by the 
Iraq occupation. 
<P>Yet for all the criticism, neither the Democratic Party nor the foreign 
policy elite has devised an alternative for the post-Sept. 11 world, leaving 
U.S. foreign policy adrift. 
<P>No one has an endgame for Iraq. No one offers any magic bullets against 
stateless terrorists undeterred by conventional military power, or the 
dangerous regimes in Iran and North Korea that many believe to be bent on 
nuclear arms. The United States now faces a set of bad options  --  or, at 
best, a deeply chastened view of the limits of American power. 
<P>By many measures, the United States is weaker and its enemies stronger 
than before the 2003 Iraq invasion, the experts say.  
<P>The United States may find it hard, if not impossible, the analysts say, 
to again try in the near future to topple a hostile regime. Its military is 
stretched, its moral standing diminished. Even democracy itself is tarnished, 
often equated now with car bombs and chaos, rather than peace and prosperity. 
<P>"The kind of thing people in the administration prided themselves in 
understanding, namely the use of power, was actually the very thing they proved 
not to be able to use effectively," said David Holloway of Stanford 
University's Center for International Security and Cooperation, which conducts 
research and training on issues of international security. 
<P>Bush's domestic support  --  the crucial ingredient in U.S. foreign policy 
--  is fading fast. Conservatives are fracturing over the war, and rising 
Republican disenchantment could swell to rebellion if the GOP loses control of 
the House or Senate in the November elections.  
<P>Even ardent backers of the Iraq invasion are alarmed. 
<P>"We're losing" in Iraq, said Max Boot, a senior fellow at the Council on 
Foreign Relations who supported the war. "The country is sliding into civil 
war, and the president doesn't seem to be doing very much about it. That has 
tremendous negative repercussions throughout the region and indeed the world, 
because it's really a black eye for the United States and a blow to democracy 
advocates around the region." 
<P>Bush's foreign policy is not without successes. 
<P>Libya abandoned terrorism and weapons of mass destruction after the Iraq 
invasion. The A.Q. Khan nuclear arms network in Pakistan, dedicated to sharing 
weapons secrets, was dismantled. The administration defused a nuclear showdown 
between Pakistan and India and strengthened relations with both, especially 
India, a vital emerging power. Relations with Japan are at a high point. There 
have been no big missteps on China. 
<P>The administration has elevated attention to Africa with new development 
and AIDS initiatives. Democratic movements have taken hold in Ukraine, Georgia 
and Kyrgyzstan. Alliances with Europe have largely been repaired. 
<P>And there still have been no terrorist attacks on U.S. soil since Sept. 
11, 2001. 
<P>But five years after Osama bin Laden's al Qaeda operatives leveled the 
World Trade Center, the world looks scarier than ever. The burgeoning civil war 
in Iraq threatens to draw in neighboring states  --  Iran, Turkey and Saudi 
Arabia  --  and set off an oil shock in the West. 
<P>World opinion, dismissed by top Bush officials, has undermined U.S. clout, 
said Joseph Nye, a professor of international relations at Harvard University. 
<P>Bush's emphasis on force has cost goodwill around the world  --  nowhere 
more than among Muslims  --  and squandered the sympathy that empowered the 
United States to invade Afghanistan after the Sept. 11 attacks. 
<P>"A president has to be able to combine the hard power of military force 
with the soft power of attracting others to want to follow us," Nye said. "In 
fighting a struggle against terrorism  --  where everything depends upon 
winning the hearts and minds of moderates  --  that loss of soft power is very 
expensive. The key to diplomacy is to divide your enemies, and Bush has in a 
sense united our enemy." 

<P>Elections have not turned out to be the panacea Bush promised. The 
Palestinian territories, as well as Egypt and Lebanon, have delivered victories 
to Hamas, Hezbollah and the Muslim Brotherhood, all considered terrorist groups 
by Washington. Lebanon's move to a new democratic government was damaged by war 
with Israel and soaring popularity for Hezbollah. 
<P>The U.S. image abroad has so eroded that Iran's leading democracy 
activist, Akbar Ganji, viewed as that country's Nelson Mandela, last month 
spurned the White House and $75 million in aid. 
<P>The failure to get international support is now seen as one of the 
costliest mistakes of the war. 
<P>"In the end, we are weaker because we have fewer with us, and we cannot do 
everything alone," said Rand Beers, a National Security Council official for 
four presidents from Ronald Reagan to George W. Bush who resigned over Iraq. 
<P>"There is no doubt in my mind that any president would or certainly should 
have done what we did in Afghanistan, but we had the entire U.N. with us," 
Beers said. "We had a real opportunity to change the way the world was dealing 
with terrorism on a cooperative, global basis, and we didn't use that 
opportunity." 
<P>Said former Bush State Department official Jon Alterman, "It seems to me 
the key aspect of the Bush Doctrine is moral clarity. The problem with moral 
clarity is: How do you achieve better results in the here and now and not in 
the afterlife?" 
<P>Iraq has become a terrorist training and recruitment tool. Afghanistan is 
slipping out of control, with the Taliban rising again in the south. 
<P>Iran and North Korea  --  part of Bush's "axis of evil" with Saddam 
Hussein's Iraq  --  are thought to be continuing their quest for nuclear 
weapons in open defiance of the West. Many contend that the Iraq invasion 
strengthened Iran and weakened U.S. leverage. 
<P>Neoconservatives are agitating for a pre-emptive air war against Iran, but 
many believe such a course would inflame the Muslim world. And, they say, it 
ignores Iran's capacity to retaliate and the limitations of air power, as 
demonstrated by Israel's campaign in Lebanon.  
<P>The promotion of democracy  --  Bush's key to transforming the Middle East 
--  has been set back. 
<P>"For many decades, the United States was considered a model democracy and 
was an inspiration for democracy activists all over the world," said Mike 
McFaul, a senior fellow at Stanford's Hoover Institution and a professor of 
political science. "Today, it is most certainly the case that being affiliated 
with the U.S. is no longer necessarily a positive for democratic activists. You 
see this particularly in Egypt. You see it particularly in Iran." 
<P>Larry Diamond, a former adviser to the U.S. provisional government in Iraq 
now at the Hoover Institution, agreed. 
<P>"There's a very broad view among not only the established pro-American 
regimes  --  the Jordanian regime, the Moroccan regime, even the Egyptian and 
Saudi, and Qatar and Kuwait even more so  --  and among many secular democratic 
forces in the region, that we have just messed up very badly, and strengthened 
Islamic forces, and strengthened the instinct of a lot of these regimes to 
resist." 
<P>There are setbacks elsewhere. Venezuela's Hugo Chavez is perceived as 
Latin America's new Castro, and Russia is sliding back to authoritarianism  --  
both, some believe, symptoms of administration distraction and rising 
anti-Americanism. 
<P>Most damaging of all, the Iraq war has lost public support at home. 
<P>"Without a strong president, it's hard for the United States to act 
decisively in the world," said Michael Mandelbaum, head of foreign policy at 
Johns Hopkins University's School of Advanced International Studies and author 
of "The Case for Goliath." "When you're successful, you attract followers. When 
you're not successful, the opposite happens, and in Iraq, so far, we're not 
successful." 
<P>Iraq is not yet lost, Bush's allies contend. 

<P>The measure of U.S. success, and how much "Iraqis believe this venture for 
democracy is going to succeed, is whether they continue to be willing to sign 
up for the police and the army," said Kori Shake, a former Bush National 
Security Council official now at Hoover. "That tells you, given the risk they 
are running, how much they believe in what's going on." 
<P>Iraqi leaders "continue to make solid, sensible judgments that the 
American founding fathers would have been pleased to count their own," she 
said. Iraq "will succeed or fail based largely on what Iraqis do and not what 
we do at this point, and I think they're making good choices." 
<P>But the broad consensus is that staying the course is not working. The 
Iraqi death rate of the last two months translates to 40,000 a year, Diamond 
said, and "if that isn't civil war, I don't know what is. 
<P>"I literally do not know anyone outside the administration who thinks that 
simply staying the course we're on now is going to work," he said. "I know 
people who think we need to do a lot more. I know people who think the current 
level of troops is about right, but we need a very different strategy in terms 
of how we use them and proceed politically. I know people who think we need to 
start heading for the exits."  
<P>The problem is, no one knows a way out. 
<P>"There isn't a pretty scenario that is looming on the horizon, and that's 
one of the reasons the foreign policy community hasn't gravitated to a common 
position," said Charles Kupchan, a former National Security Council official 
for President Bill Clinton. "There's just lots of bad options."
