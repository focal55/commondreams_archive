<p>The inevitable head-on collision between Britain's climate change and aviation policies moves a step closer today with figures showing the total distance flown by the Government's own ministers and senior officials last year alone is equivalent to 14 return trips to the Moon. </p>
<p>Tony Blair, his cabinet colleagues and their officials clocked up 6.5 
  million air miles, according to the Cabinet Office's list of flights during 
  the 2005-2006 financial year - and in doing so pumped almost 1,000 tons of 
  carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, analysis shows.
</p>
<p>
  Environmental groups went on the attack last night over the huge scale of 
  the emissions. The figures starkly underline the fact that, although the 
  Blair Government is talking ever more loudly about the problem of global 
  warming, it cannot itself get to grips with its fastest-rising cause - 
  emissions of greenhouse gases from aircraft engines.
</p>
<p>
  If they are not reduced, it will be impossible for the UK to achieve its 
  long-term climate target of cutting back CO2 by 60 per cent by 2050 - yet 
  the Government's official aviation policy is for flying to expand enormously 
  between now and 2030.
</p>
<p>
  The Liberal Democrats, who commissioned the research, said replacing the 350 
  flights to Brussels or Paris by ministers and officials with trips on 
  Eurostar would have saved more than 30 tons of carbon.

</p>
<p>
  Further criticism of the Government will come tomorrow in a report from 
  Oxford University, that says ministers' support for airport expansion is 
  completely at odds with their drive to combat climate change. It will warn 
  that, by 2050, carbon dioxide emissions from aviation in the UK could be up 
  to 10 times higher than in 1990, taking up two-thirds of the Government's 
  total emissions target.
</p>
<p>
  Dr Brenda Boardman, project leader at Oxford's Environmental Change 
  Institute, said air travel by ministers was "a very good example" 
  of the contradictions in the Government's policies.
</p>
<p>
  Top of the Government's carbon league was Mr Blair, whose 13 flights, 
  including trips to Australia, Washington and Beijing, created an estimated 
  500 tons of carbon dioxide. The Department of Environment Food and Rural 
  Affairs (Defra) was the fifth highest polluter, with an estimated 34.7 tons 
  of carbon dioxide from its trips.
</p>
<p>
  The CarbonNeutral Company, which worked out the figures, found the 
  Government's flights, which cost a total of &pound;3.5m, created 966.4 tons of 
  carbon dioxide.

</p>
<p>
  The Liberal Democrats called on ministers to cut their emissions. Chris 
  Huhne, the party's environment spokesman, said: "Tony Blair's jet-set 
  Cabinet is sending out completely the wrong message. The carbon dioxide 
  emissions from ministerial travel are leaving an indelible footprint on our 
  planet.
</p>
<p>
  "The Government has been warned it could miss its targets for reducing 
  CO2 and it is now time for ministers to start setting an example. The 
  Government has failed completely to tackle the problem of aviation 
  pollution. Not only is it wasting taxpayers' money taking expensive and 
  unnecessary flights, including many to Brussels and Paris for which there is 
  an easy alternative."
</p>
<p>
  Mr Huhne said the Government had done nothing to tackle aviation emissions 
  generally and should replace Air Passenger Duty with an emissions charge on 
  each aircraft taking off.
</p>
<p>
  Emily Armistead, climate campaigner with the pressure group Greenpeace, 
  said: "This is the wrong message to send when aviation is a massive 
  problem in terms of CO2 emissions and it is growing exponentially. What the 
  Government should be doing is leading the way in tackling business travel 
  and making sure journeys are absolutely necessary. If they have to go to 
  Brussels they should go on the train or perhaps use video-conferencing.
</p>

<p>
  "They are completely unwilling to tackle the issue of aviation. They 
  are planning for airport expansion, not even keeping air travel at its 
  current level."
</p>
<p>
  The Government said it was the first in the world to offset its emissions 
  from air travel - neutralizing the amount of carbon used by reducing 
  emissions by the same amount elsewhere.
</p>
<p>
  But critics say the ability to buy offsets deters real behavioral change 
  and that there are doubts about some of the projects being funded. For 
  example, destroying industrial waste gases brings little long-term benefit.
</p>
<p>
  Mr Blair began offsetting last year and, since April, all ministers and 
  officials have been recording emissions, which will be offset over a 
  three-year period to 2009 by backing small scale and sustainable energy 
  efficiency and renewable energy projects under a United Nations scheme.
</p>
<p>

  "Whilst the figures look high, it must be remembered that travel 
  remains an essential part of government business, particularly for ministers 
  who face tight schedules and time constraints to complete their duties,"
   said a Defra spokesman. "The Government recognises that offsetting is 
  only part of the picture, and is taking measures to encourage more 
  sustainable travel --for example, the use of Eurostar where possible and the 
  use of video conferencing."
</p>
<p>
  Today, all MPs will be urged to back a personal carbon trading scheme being 
  piloted by the Royal Society of Arts (RSA) under which people would have an 
  annual carbon limit. If they exceed it, they would have to buy carbon 
  credits. If they were below it, they could sell their credits.
</p>
<p>
  David Miliband, the Environment Secretary, will join the scheme tomorrow, 
  allowing the RSA's Carbon Limited project to monitor his lifestyle to see 
  whether he is setting a good example to the nation.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Offsetting: A viable solution?</b>
</p>
<p>

  * Carbon offsetting is a way of neutralizing, or making up for, the 
  emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), the principal greenhouse gas causing 
  global warming, that you yourself are responsible for.
</p>
<p>
  * It means paying for reductions in emissions somewhere else, that are 
  equivalent in volume to your own.
</p>
<p>
  * At it simplest this could be envisaged as paying a firm to plant trees on 
  your behalf, to soak up the CO2 of which you have been the source.
</p>
<p>
  * But there are difficulties with trees as the precise amount of CO2 they 
  absorb is not easy to calculate, and they may die of disease, be burnt in a 
  forest fire, or cut down.
</p>
<p>
  * Offsetting more frequently focuses on buying carbon 'credits' from 
  renewable energy projects such as windfarms, which do not produce CO2 at all.

</p>
<p>
  * There are other potential difficulties with offsetting firms, such as how 
  they are policed and who guarantees customers they are doing a good job.
</p>
<p>
  * But the principal objection to offsetting is that it makes people think 
  their polluting can be cancelled out by paying a small cash sum, and so they 
  do not change their behavior.
