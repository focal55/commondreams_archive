<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->BERLIN  - Berlin's European Film Market 
became the backdrop for yet another verbal battle between 
Wal-Mart and its filmmaker nemesis Robert Greenwald on Tuesday. 
The Greenwald-directed film "<a href="http://images.ultracart.com/aff/BNF/684/70/118/231/0/index.html" target="_new">Wal-Mart: The High Cost of Low 
Price</a>" made for hot sales but heated words at the market.

The verbal clash followed a similar series of jousts in the 
U.S. when Greenwald's film came out last year utilizing 
grassroots distribution, promotion via the Internet and home 
screenings to rack up DVD sales of more than 110,000 units. 
Wal-Mart countered with a campaign decrying the movie and 
providing access to brothers Ron and Robert Galloway to produce 
a countermeasure movie titled "Why Wal-Mart Works: And Why That 
Drives Some People Crazy."

<p>On Tuesday, Greenwald claimed that some buyers are worried 
that the retail giant might retaliate against them. A Wal-Mart 
spokesman dismissed those claims as "preposterous."

<p>"We have experienced some scared theatrical distributors," 
Greenwald insisted after a "Wal-Mart" screening here. "They are 
afraid that their other movies will be pulled from the 
(retailer's) shelves if they distribute my film."

<p>Wal-Mart spokesman Olan James countered in an interview: 
"To say that we'd retaliate against a distributor for carrying 
this film is simply preposterous. We've chosen not to carry 
either film in our stores -- the (Galloways') pro-Wal-Mart 
documentary or this anti-Wal-Mart film. But we're confident 
that the public will be able to spot the glaring inaccuracies 
throughout the (latter) film."

<p>He was referring to the situation that arose in the U.S. 
last year with the release of "Why Wal-Mart Works." Lightning 
Entertainment's Richard Guardian said initially eager buyers 
from Brazil, Japan and Mexico, where Wal-Mart is a growing 
retail force, said they were worried that buying the film could 
have negative commercial repercussions for their DVD 
distribution business.

<p>According to its own figures, Wal-Mart operates about 2,400 
stores outside the U.S. In some territories, the retailer is a 
major player. In the U.K., for example, Wal-Mart is the 
second-largest retailer with its chain of ASDA-brand stores.

<p>Lightning Entertainment said it has inked deals at the 
European Film Market for Germany, the U.K. and Australia/New 
Zealand. Guardian said he expects to close on Spain, Benelux 
and France this week and that several European pubcasters also 
are circling.

<p>"The response here at the Berlinale has been unbelievable," 
Guardian said. "The film addresses global issues, and people 
are fascinated with the U.S. society and culture."

<p>The docu's claims of runaway capitalism make it a natural 
for many European territories. Wal-Mart stories have been 
front-page news in such places as Germany, France and the U.K.
