<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p> <b>Richard Armitage</b> 
<p> Colin Powell's number two quit at the same time as his boss after the 2004 election.</p>
<p><b>Jose Maria Aznar</b></p>
<p>Spanish PM. Victim of Islamic extremism caused by war. Ousted after Madrid bombs.</p>
<p><b>Silvio Berlusconi</b></p>
<p>Big backer of the war, sending 2,000 Italian troops. Cost him his job as PM this April.</p>
<p><b>Tony Blair</b></p>
<p>In last year of premiership. Still insists war was right, but it will be his unwanted legacy.</p>

<p><b>John Bolton</b></p>
<p>The neocons' darling as ambassador to the UN. Infuriated Powell and Armitage.</p>
<p><b>Paul Bremer</b></p>
<p>Ran Iraq's civilian affairs after war. Crucially, disbanded Iraqi army. Seen as a failure.</p>
<p><b>George Bush</b></p>
<p>Iraq buck stops here. Has two years left in office with hostile Congress. Lame duck.</p>
<p><b>Alastair Campbell</b></p>
<p>Brilliant PR reputation lost in row over 'sexing up' dossier on case for war. Later quit.</p>
<p><b>Ahmed Chalabi</b></p>

<p>CIA adviser behind 'evidence' of weapons of mass destruction. Failed to win Iraq seat.</p>
<p><b>DICK CHENEY</b></p>
<p>Arch neocon, and key foreign policy voice. Despite war fiasco, will remain Vice-President.</p>
<p><b>Iain Duncan Smith</b></p>
<p>Backing for war crucial. Limits Tories' scope to criticise now. Dumped as leader in 2004.</p>
<p><b>Jay Garner</b></p>
<p>US general supposed to lead the occupation. Replaced after a month as violence flared.</p>
<p><b>Lord Goldsmith</b></p>
<p>Friend of Blair. Despite doubts, eventually ruled war legal. Still Attorney General</p>

<p><b>Sir Jeremy Greenstock</b></p>
<p>As UK ambassador to the UN, tried to build coalition for war. Now works for think-tank.</p>
<p><b>Geoff Hoon</b></p>
<p>Loyal Defence Secretary demoted to be Leader of Commons. Now Europe minister.</p>
<p><b>Sir Christopher Meyer</b></p>
<p>Was UK ambassador in US. Currently heads PCC, press watchdog. Has become war critic.</p>
<p><b>Colin Powell</b></p>
<p>Secretary of State's February 2003 speech to UN making case for war was untrue. Retired.</p>
<p><b>Condoleezza Rice</b></p>

<p>Replaced Powell. No fan of Cheney-Rumsfeld agenda. But has never objected.</p>
<p><b>Donald Rumsfeld</b></p>
<p>Ruthless US Defence Secretary. Tried to redefine US Army. Paid with job for war fiasco.</p>
<p><b>John Scarlett</b></p>
<p>Allowed 'sexing up' of dossier making case for war. Reward? Promotion. Heads MI6.</p>
<p><b>Jack Straw</b></p>
<p>As Foreign Secretary, loyally backed Blair's Iraq strategy. His payback was demotion.</p>
<p><b>George Tenet</b></p>
<p>CIA chief called case for Iraq's weapons of mass destruction "a slam dunk". Sacked.</p>

<p><b>John Williams</b></p>
<p>Foreign Office spin doctor who wrote a draft of the WMD dossier. Now a freelance journalist.</p>
<p><b>Paul Wolfowitz</b></p>
<p>Deputy at Defence. Neo-con and intellectual force behind war. Went to World Bank. </p>
