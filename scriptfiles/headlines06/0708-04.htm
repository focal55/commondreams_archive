<p>Since the Al Gore global warming film, <a href="http://www.climatecrisis.net/" target="_new">"An Inconvenient Truth,"</a> opened in 
the Bay Area five weeks ago, approving audiences have left the theater 
murmuring a similar refrain: "I hope the people who need to see it, see it."

        <!--/endimage/-->In the region's politically blue vernacular, that translates as "red state 
audiences." And so far, those audiences are seeing it. The film is playing in 
the nation's top 185 markets, getting off-the-chart audience recommendations in 
conservative bastions like Plano, Texas, and Orange County. "Truth" is the 
third-highest-grossing political documentary of all time, behind Michael 
Moore's "Fahrenheit 9/11" (which grossed $119 million) and "Bowling for 
Columbine" ($21 million). 
<P>And a key to making "An Inconvenient Truth" accessible to a wide range of 
audiences started with the first conversation Gore had last summer with 
director Davis Guggenheim in San Francisco's Ritz-Carlton Hotel. Each had a 
demand. 
<P>Gore wanted the science to be handled correctly, not trivialized. 
Guggenheim, director of Fox's breakneck TV hit "24," wanted to tell the story 
through Gore's life. 
<P>"He didn't want to do that," Guggenheim said in an interview this week 
from Los Angeles. "He thought people would think he was trying to politicize 
the issue and pick it apart." 
<P>Eventually, Guggenheim convinced Gore that the only way to make the film's 
tidal wave of charts and graphs appealing would be to humanize the ex-vice 
president's 30-year effort to warn of global warming's danger. 
<P><b>Gaining on Madonna </b>
<P>That approach seems to be working so far. While certainly not a summer 
blockbuster, "An Inconvenient Truth" has earned $13.8 million in the six weeks 
since it opened. By the time Monday's weekend box office takes roll in, Gore's 
"Truth" could overtake "Madonna: Truth or Dare" ($15 million) as the 
fourth-highest-grossing general interest documentary of all time. 
<P>Now playing in 562 theaters nationwide, "An Inconvenient Truth" no longer 
is doing strong business just in the "preach-to-the-choir cities like San 
Francisco and New York," said Paul Dergarabedian, president of Exhibitor 
Relations Co., a box office tracking company in Encino. 

<P>"It's been very impressive, especially for a documentary that is 
essentially a slide show," Dergarabedian said. "It's the kind of movie that 
people will continue to go to see because it's topical. It's the right movie at 
the right time. I foresee it playing for a while in the theaters." 
<P>Last month, Paramount Classics conducted what it called "extensive exit 
polling" of "Inconvenient Truth" audiences in conservative suburban markets 
like Plano and Irvine (Orange County), as well as Dallas and Long Island. 
<P>In a successful film, 60 percent of the audience rates it "excellent" or 
"very good." Among the poll respondents, 92 percent rated "Truth" highly, 
Paramount Classics Executive Vice President of Distribution Rob Schulze said 
Friday. 
<P>More critical to the film's continued theatrical run: 87 percent of the 
respondents said they'd recommend the film to a friend; the industry average 
for a successful film is 47 percent, he said. 
<P>"For people who are motivated to see the film, they're saying that it is 
entertaining and inspirational," Schulze said. "We're very enthused about its 
performance and see it staying in theaters all summer." 
<P>But last summer, Guggenheim and Gore realized the challenges behind the 
phrase "for people who are motivated to see the film"  --  especially, as 
Guggenheim termed it, "a movie about a slide show on global warming that 
features a man who was at the center of a highly charged political election." 
<P>"We wanted to make a movie for that guy driving a pickup who is a little 
bit skeptical of what global warming is about," he said. 

<P><b>Political baggage </b>
<P>A key challenge to wooing that pickup driver would be overcoming any 
feelings he had for Gore, who carries a ton of political baggage for a movie 
star. 
<P>In an analysis of Gore's unsuccessful 2000 presidential campaign, the 
Greenberg Quinlan Rosner Research firm found that many voters believed Gore 
could do a better job than George W. Bush on the economy, health issues and the 
environment. But many voters had "trust" issues with him, according to the 
study. Most were related to "his exaggerations and untruthfulness" and "his 
being too close to Bill Clinton," it said. 
<P>So far, the science in the movie has survived scrutiny. In June, as the 
film opened to a wider audience, 19 climate scientists who had seen the film or 
read the accompanying book told the Associated Press that "Truth's" depictions 
are accurate. 
<P>Artistically speaking, the Web site <A HREF="http://www.metacritic.com" target="_new">www.metacritic.com</A> compiled the 
weighted average of 31 reviews from national critics and gave "An Inconvenient 
Truth" "generally favorable reviews"  --  a score of 74 out of 100, 
15th-highest among films in theaters. 
<P><b>The right tone </b>
<P>Not everybody's been a fan. The Boston Globe's Washington bureau chief 
criticized the film's inclusion of "gauzy biographical material that seems to 
have been culled from old Gore campaign commercials." 

<P>Yet the film's continued success in red states like Georgia and Texas 
shows that audiences seem not too put off that Gore appears in nearly every 
shot of the film, often in close-ups where his face consumes half the screen. 
<P>"Tone was very important in this film," Guggenheim said. "We didn't want 
to be blaming anyone. We wanted to convey the message that 'we're all in this 
together.' " 
<P>Guggenheim said he and the former vice president tried to depoliticize the 
movie by "not pointing fingers at anyone. I cut a lot of the politics out." 
<P>Yet early on in the film, Gore tosses off a one-liner that pokes fun at 
the Bush administration. 
<P>"I cut it out because I thought it would put people off," Guggenheim said. 
But some of the other producers persuaded him to restore it. 
<P>"And the truth of the matter is, it was such a great laugh, and you needed 
that early in this movie. I think the guy in the pickup would laugh," he said. 
<P><b>Too much Gore? </b>
<P>That still left the dilemma over how much of Gore's personal life to 
include. Political critics had blasted Gore in the past for politically 
exploiting the death of his sister to lung cancer and an accident that nearly 
killed his son. Plus, Gore has resisted interviewers wanting to probe his 
deepest feelings about the 2000 election. 
<P>Guggenheim waited until filming was nearly completed before approaching 
that terrain, which would be critical to the film. Finally, in a Los Angeles 
hotel room, the director did something "that most filmmakers would think was 
crazy": He spoke with Gore without any cameras. Just a microphone. Alone. When 
they started to talk, the sun was pouring into the room. Three hours later, 
they were sitting in darkness. 
<P>"As a filmmaker, you're always looking for a truth, but it's an 'emotional 
truth,' " Guggenheim said. "I wanted to go deep, deep, deep with him. That was 
what would resonate with a lot of people, no matter where they stood on global 
warming."</p>
