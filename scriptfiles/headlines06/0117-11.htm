<p> It was over and done with in five seconds.      <p>       As two white T-1A Jayhawk jet trainers from the 99th Flying Training        Squadron streaked over Pittman-Sullivan Park on Monday where Martin        Luther King Day marchers had convened, critics of the flyover pointed        their fingers skyward and shouted, &quot;Shame, shame, shame, shame.&quot;      </p>     <p>       The 99th Squadron is the original squadron of the Tuskegee Airmen, the        first U.S. military air unit of African American pilots. It is believed        to be the first time a military flyover had taken place at an MLK march        anywhere.     </p>     <p>       Despite the drizzle and light rain, police estimated some 100,000 people        attended the San Antonio march, annually considered to be one of the        largest in the country.     </p>     <p>       In the weeks that preceded the march, activists were angered by the MLK        Commission's decision to invite a military flyover to honor King.     </p>     <p>       A few, including City Council member Patti Radle, considered boycotting        the event but, in the end, decided to show up.     </p>     <p>       &quot;I felt it was very important to be here and say what I want to say,&quot;        Radle said, while holding a poster that read: &quot;Keep King's Message        Clear: Love, Understanding, Non-Violence.&quot;     </p>     <p>       People took to the streets with banners and signs that read, &quot;MLK Lived        for Peace. Military Lives for War,&quot; and chanted phrases like, &quot;Shame,        shame on you, MLK Commission.&quot;     </p>     <p>       Cordell Jones and his wife and two children have joined the march since        his eldest child was born nine years ago.     </p>     <p>       &quot;Personally, that's not what this is about,&quot; Jones said, referring to        the flyover. &quot;My hope is for my children to grow up appreciating people        for their differences. I hope they don't see racial lines.&quot;     </p>     <p>       Jane Tuck, a member of a peace group, stood along Martin Luther King        Drive and carried a sign that read: &quot;MLK Was Against Militarism.&quot;      </p>     <p>       Some people raised their hands flashing a peace sign, while others shot        the finger at them.     </p>     <p>       And some just walked up to the protesters and gave them a piece of their        mind.     </p>     <p>       &quot;The police don't lay down their guns. The firefighters don't lay down        their hoses. So why do you want the military to lay down their arms?&quot;        Eloise Forge asked Tuck as she walked along Martin Luther King Drive.        &quot;You should be going against the government, not the military.&quot;     </p>     <p>       Tucker smiled and responded, &quot;We are.&quot;     </p>     <p>       &quot;I have not had the privilege of being anywhere that had it going on        like you have it going on in San Antonio,&quot; said the Rev. James E. Meeks,        an Illinois state senator and executive vice president of the National        Rainbow/PUSH Coalition, who gave the keynote address.     </p>     <p>       Meeks said April 3, 1968 &#8212; the day of King's last public speech &#8212; is one        of the most memorable days in history. It was then that an ailing King        said he was not afraid of dying because he knew African Americans would        make it to the Promised Land.     </p>     <p>       &quot;Are we there yet?&quot; Meeks asked. &quot;We've got some problems in America.&quot;      </p>     <p>       Meeks said there is still much work to do to create a level racial        playing field in schools, business, politics and society. He pointed to        low high school graduation rates among minorities, the disproportionate        number of minorities in prison and the small amount of the country's        wealth that blacks own.     </p>     <p>       &quot;Black people only own 2 percent of the nation's wealth,&quot; he said.      </p>     <p>       &quot;African Americans are in a deep hole in America,&quot; Meeks said. &quot;If we        start focusing on white America as the opposition, we'll never make it.&quot;      </p>     <p>       He told the audience to reclaim the America that King longed and dreamed        for.     </p>     <p>       &quot;Stand up, be strong and happy birthday, Dr. King,&quot; Meeks said. &quot;America        is watching San Antonio, Texas.&quot;     </p>
