<p>Anti-war activist Cindy Sheehan and best-selling author John Perkins will headline a who's who of peace proponents this week as the national convention of Veterans for Peace convenes Thursday on the University of Washington campus.</p>
<p>At least 500  of the 5,000 members of Veterans for Peace are expected to attend, said William Schmidt, a Korean War veteran and the organization's local spokesman.  The anti-war group was begun in 1985 by four U.S. veterans of various wars concerned about American use of its volunteer fighting forces. </p>
<p>The convention runs through Sunday, when its activities include veterans taking a bus to the Peace Arch in Blaine to meet U.S. war resisters from other conflicts who now live in Canada.</p>
<p>Although open to the public, the convention, which includes speakers, workshops, entertainers and poets at the UW's HUB auditorium, is not free. </p>
<p>Admission Thursday is $75, Friday is $100 and  a three-day package is $225. A banquet Saturday costs $40. A women's caucus dealing with issues such as sexual harassment in the military will meet every day. Information is available online at www.vfpnationalconvention.org. </p>
<p>Sheehan, whose soldier son was killed in Iraq in April 2004, became the face of the anti-war movement a year ago, jump-starting it when she camped out for 26 days in August 2005 near President Bush's home in Crawford, Texas, to protest the U.S. presence in Iraq. She is in Crawford again this week to protest the war.</p>
<p>Sheehan is slated to speak in Seattle on Thursday night.</p>

<p>Perkins,  the convention's main featured speaker, will speak Friday night. His best-selling book, "Confessions of an Economic Hit Man," is based upon his 30 years in the private sector persuading Third World nations to accept enormous U.S. loans and become beholden to U.S. interests.</p>
<p>"It's an all-star cast of war resisters," Schmidt said. </p>
<p>On Saturday night, the convention is slated to hear from more speakers, including Army 1st Lt. Ehren Watada, a Fort Lewis Stryker Brigade soldier facing a military hearing later this month after refusing to deploy with his unit to Iraq in June. He calls the U.S.-led war in Iraq illegal.</p>
<p>Schmidt's own transition from soldier-at-war to anti-war activist reflects the motivations of many of the group's members. </p>
<p>"In Korea, the policy of containment of communism seemed logical at the time, and people like myself thought it was a just deal: 'We're stopping them.' In Vietnam, containment was the same thing. But when the war started to crumble, and with the loss of life, I thought no one should be in there. People will be in the streets protesting. I was right. It was a real turning point for me," he said.</p>
<p>"The 20th century has not been very good for me," he added, "and the start of the 21st has been awful. It's the body counts that get to me, not only of the soldiers, but the terrible civilian body counts."</p>
<p>In addition to war resisters of U.S. conflicts past and present, speakers and workshop facilitators include:</p>
<p><li>Ray McGovern, a former Central Intelligence Agency analyst whose 27-year career spanned the administrations from Presidents Kennedy to George H.W. Bush and who is a co-founder of Veteran Intelligence Professionals for Sanity.</p>
<p><li>Dahr Jamail, a correspondent from Iraq for the Inter Press Service, whose dispatches are picked up by The Nation, The Independent, Flashpoint and others.</p>

<p><li>Diane Benson, founder of Alaska's Native Performance and Film Commission, and mother of a soldier seriously wounded in Iraq during his second deployment with the 101st Airborne Division.</p>
<p><li>Michael McPhearson, a Desert Storm veteran and executive director of Veterans for Peace.</p>
<p><li>Simona Sharoni of the Peace and Justice Studies Association at The Evergreen State College in Olympia and an Israeli military veteran now associated with Israeli military groups, and author of "Gender and the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict."</p>
<p><li>Marjorie Cohn, a lecturer and commentator on human rights and U.S. foreign policy heard on the BBC, CNN, MSNBC, Fox News and National Public Radio. She will wind up the convention with a talk titled "Supporting the Troops."</p>
<p>Veterans for Peace began its activism in the 1980s against Reagan  administration incursions in Latin America. In addition to organizing against the U.S.-led war in Iraq, the St. Louis-based veterans group's activities over the years have included organizing teach-ins on the 1991 Persian Gulf War, joining with veterans groups in Canada, Great Britain and Japan for a moratorium on global arms sales, arranging medical services in Bosnia and helping build a hospital in My Lai, Vietnam, site of the massacre of nearly 500 Vietnamese civilians March 16, 1968, by U.S. Army troops.</p>
<p>This will be the first time its convention has been in Seattle.</p>
<p>The organization in the 1990s received a permanent Non-Government Organization seat in the United Nations, and was the first veterans group named to the International Peace Bureau in Geneva.</p>
