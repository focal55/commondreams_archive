        <p>TALLAHASSEE, Fla. - Florida's attorney general said Wednesday his office has issued investigative subpoenas to the three companies certified to sell voting machines in Florida as he reviews a dispute between the firms and Leon County's elections supervisor.
<p>Diebold Inc., Election Systems & Software Inc., and Sequoia Voting Systems Inc. have refused to sell equipment to let disabled voters cast ballots without help in Leon County. Elections supervisor Ion Sancho has been outspoken about his concern that the devices can be easily manipulated to change race outcomes.

<p>The companies' refusal has left Leon County, which is the home of the state Capitol, in violation of the federal Help America Vote Act.

<p>"It is critical for our democratic process to work efficiently and effectively, but of most importance, fairly," Attorney General Charlie Crist said. "These subpoenas are to ensure that the rights of our voters with disabilities as well as all Florida voters are secured."

<p>Crist wants to see copies of documents relating to sales of voting machines by Diebold, Election Systems & Software and Sequoia in Florida since January 2003. Crist's office began the investigation in early February.

<p>"We haven't seen it, but obviously we will review it," said David Bear, spokesman for the elections division at Diebold.

<p>Michelle Shafer, spokeswoman for Oakland, Calif.-based Sequoia said the company "regards any allegations of wrongdoing in this matter as without merit and stands ready to fully cooperate" with the investigation.

<p>"We are confident a review of the facts will show that our company made a decision not to enter into a long-term formal relationship with Leon County after a thorough examination of our previous working relationship with the county," said Ken Fields, spokesman for Omaha-based Election Systems. "We did not believe that we would have the kind of working relationship that is key to providing smooth running, reliable and accurate elections. "
