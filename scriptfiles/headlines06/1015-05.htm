<p>Britain is so short of helicopters in Afghanistan that military chiefs are being forced to scour the world for civilian aircraft to support its troops after the US rejected a plea to help plug the shortfall. </p>

        
          
          
            <p>
  An aging fleet of just eight Chinooks is working around the clock to supply 
  and reinforce soldiers in remote outposts facing waves of Taliban attacks. 
  The only Chinook in the Falklands was taken away for use in the campaign.
</p>
<p>
  The revelations come in the wake of the outburst by General Sir Richard 
  Dannatt, the army chief, against the Government's military strategy last 
  week.
</p>
<p>
   <i>The Independent on Sunday </i>can also reveal that reconnaissance and 
  intelligence missions in Afghanistan are being affected by the lack of 
  smaller and more flexible helicopters. But senior military officials said 
  that when UK commanders asked for temporary deployment of US helicopters in 
  Afghanistan, they were told there were none to spare.
</p>
<p>
  Instead, the MoD has been forced to seek out commercial operators for 
  non-combat operations, to free more military craft for use at the front 
  line. So urgent is the need that Britain is understood to be asking other 
  nations that have ordered Merlin helicopters from Westland to allow the MoD 
  to requisition them.

</p>
<p>
  Just last weekend Tony Blair said: "If the commanders on the ground 
  want more equipment, armoured vehicles for example, more helicopters, that 
  will be provided. Whatever package they want we will do."
</p>
<p>
  The revelations reinforce the view of Gen Dannatt that the military is 
  running at full stretch in Iraq and Afghanistan, where yesterday two more 
  Nato soldiers were killed and an Italian photojournalist was kidnapped. But 
  it became clear this weekend that the general would not be sacked, despite 
  saying that the presence of British troops in Iraq "exacerbates" 
  the "difficulties we are facing around the world", and that we 
  should "get ourselves out some time soon".
</p>
<p>
  His outspoken views continued to attract fervent support from ordinary 
  soldiers, some of them serving in Iraq and Afghanistan. One website posting 
  from "Isquared" said: "Well done General Sir Richard. I wish 
  he had said even more about this disgusting and disgraceful 'adventure' into 
  Iraq."
</p>
<p>
  It also emerged yesterday that British forces have detailed plans to scale 
  down forces in southern Iraq in the next few months. Building work has 
  already started at the British base at Basra airport, where forces will be 
  consolidated. The main military hospital is due to move there from the 
  Shaibah logistics base out in the desert, and Shaibah, the largest base in 
  the British sector, would be closed next year.
</p>

<p>
  Smaller bases within Basra city, which attract the bulk of attacks on 
  British forces, would be closed as control passes to the Iraqis. Commanders 
  hope the British deployment of 7,200 would be almost halved by the end of 
  2007. The Pentagon is planning to maintain US troop levels in Iraq at about 
  140,000 for at least four more years.</p>
