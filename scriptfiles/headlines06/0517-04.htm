<p>Saying that port, highway and airport tie-ups are strangling the U.S. 
economy, Transportation Secretary Norm Mineta outlined on Tuesday what he 
called an ambitious national strategy to combat congestion. 
<P>Several aspects of the new Bush administration program are likely to 
generate controversy, including plans to encourage the sale or lease of public 
roads, bridges or other transportation infrastructure to private investors. The 
administration also expects criticism on a "Corridors of the Future" project in 
which local and state governments will be asked to compete to gain fast-track 
approval for three to five major projects that would slash congestion by the 
greatest amounts. 
<P>Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger said early this year he was interested in 
exploring more public-private transportation partnerships as a way of building 
or maintaining more highways and bridges in a state of more than 35 million 
people that is growing rapidly and where transportation dollars are stretched 
thin. 
<P>Sales of public transportation facilities in the past few years have set 
off a flurry of interest among public officials, including Schwarzenegger. The 
sales have included Chicago Mayor Richard Daley's decision to reach a 99-year, 
$1.9 billion lease deal for the Chicago Skyway, a toll bridge, and Indiana's 
pending $3.8 billion, 75-year lease of the state's toll road. 

<P>The new operators will run the tollways and bridges, maintain them and get 
the right to raise tolls to pay off the debt they incur by entering into the 
deals. There has been some criticism about privatizing public assets and 
opening the door to sharp toll increases. 
<P>Mineta said he has met recently with investment bankers and hedge fund 
operators who are interested in similar deals or in actually building and 
operating, for a profit, projects such as the few private toll roads in 
Southern California. 
<P>The proposal for private partnerships builds on studies such as one 
released last January by a blue-ribbon panel of the National Research Council. 
"The federal government should encourage states to experiment with arrangements 
for tolling and private-sector participation in road development," the report 
said 
<P>This is one area that could require a change in law because, until now, 
the federal government has not allowed tolls to be charged on roads built with 
federal highway monies.  
<P>California's legislature has put a $20 billion transportation bond package 
before voters in November, but even that isn't enough to meet the state's 
needs. 
<P>"Clearly the governor's plans intend looking" at "privately financing new 
lanes and roads," Daniel Sperling of the UC Davis Institute of Transportation 
Studies said at a conference in Washington, D.C., earlier this year. "We don't 
have the revenue, so we need new ways to finance new facilities." 
<P>But Martin Wachs of the Brookings Institution warned about the dangers of 
selling public assets. "Selling off an asset could be a popular notion, but it 
sows long-term problems. It's an attractive idea to avoid tax increases or user 
fees but my voice will take the other side," he said.  
<P>Mineta, appearing before the National Retail Federation, cited statistics 
that show the costs of traffic congestion. He said freight delays are estimated 
to cost American business $200 billion year. Motorists waste 3.7 billion hours 
and 2.3 billion gallons of fuel a year sitting in traffic. Airplane delays cost 
an additional $9.4 billion annually. 
<P>Mineta said his congestion relief program will include investigation of 
so-called "congestion pricing," the idea of charging motorists more to use 
roads at peak times; encouraging flex-time at jobs and more telecommuting; 
encouraging more express bus services in urban areas and expediting completion 
of highway projects that could help relieve the greatest congestion. 
<P>Mineta said the federal government could help accomplish this by, for 
instance, giving preference to highway projects that include express bus lanes 
or are located in areas where government and employers agree on flex-time 
plans. 
<P>Mineta zeroed in on the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, which handle 
more than 40 percent of the 9 million shipping containers that arrive each year 
in the United States. Congestion around Los Angeles has become a major economic 
bottleneck for the entire country. One idea he mentioned is creating truck-only 
toll lanes on Interstate 15 in San Bernardino County. Southern California 
authorities are already considering a $16.5 billion system of truck lanes. 
<P>Mineta said many of the ideas won't require approval by Congress, which 
last year passed a long-delayed $286.5 billion, six-year highway and public 
transit funding bill. President Bush signed the bill last August, after 
threatening to veto the larger bill that many in Congress wanted. 
<P>"We must embrace new solutions if we are to make headway," said Mineta, 
the former San Jose mayor and congressman who is the only Democrat in Bush's 
Cabinet. 
<P>Mineta, who served as mayor from 1971 to 1974, said he and other mayors 
across the country made mistakes in deciding where to site highways in their 
cities. Instead of combatting congestion and urban sprawl, he said, their 
decisions fed both. 
<P>"We created our own congestion. I intended to relieve congestion, but only 
added to congestion. Now as secretary of transportation, I am trying to undo 
that congestion. I have come full circle," said Mineta, who said he regrets 
Santa Clara County's decision four decades ago not to join BART. The idea of 
extending BART to San Jose is still being debated.
