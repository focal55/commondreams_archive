<p>WASHINGTON - June 14 - Following the Peace Alliance's Mother's Day "Peace of the Pie" campaign in which supporters delivered "peace pies" to more than 165 congressional offices nationwide, nine additional members of Congress have signed on to this historic legislation that would create a U.S. Department of Peace and Nonviolence.

<p>"Our recent Mother's Day campaign, conducted in the spirit of peace and inspired by Julia Ward Howe's poem calling for an end to all war and the beginning of a culture of peace, clearly moved the hearts and minds of many in Congress, and persuaded them that their constituents believe peace deserves a 'piece of the pie'," said Peace Alliance Executive Director Dot Maver. "We welcome these new Congressional endorsers to the growing movement of people in this country and around the world who believe that a culture of peace is not only possible but necessary, and we thank them for their support."

<p>A total of 73 congressional representatives now endorse the Department of Peace legislation in the U.S. House (HR 3760); two senators endorse the companion legislation in the U.S. Senate (S1756).

<p>A Department of Peace would research and analyze foreign policy and recommend to the President ways to address the root causes of war. A Peace Academy, on par with the Military Service Academies, would train civilian peacekeepers and the military in the latest nonviolent conflict resolution techniques and approaches. The Department would also provide expert advice to the President when diffusing or dealing with international crises.

<p>Domestically, the Department would be responsible for developing new policies that address issues such as child abuse, domestic violence, gang violence, and cultural and racial violence.  Statistics reveal that each year, medical expenses from domestic violence alone total at least $3 to $5 billion. Businesses forfeit another $100 million in lost wages, sick leave, absenteeism and non-productivity due to domestic violence.

<p>Providing the tools necessary to teach violence prevention to America's school children is just one of the many ways a U.S. Department of Peace would reduce violence in our homes and schools.

<p>The list of new endorsers includes:<br>

Rep Andrews, Robert E. (D-NJ-1) - 202.225.6501<br>

Rep Cleaver II, Emmanuel (D-MI-5) - 202.225.4535<br>

Rep Clyburn, James E. (D-SC-6) - 202.225.3315<br>

Rep Green, Al (D-TX-9) - 202.225.7508<br>

Rep Hastings, Alcee L. (D-FL-23) - 202.225.1313<br>

Rep Larson, John B. (D-CT-1) - 202.225.2265<br>

Rep Millender-McDonald, Juanita (D-CA-37) - 202.225.7924<br>

Rep Moran, James P. (D-VA-8) - 202.225.4376<br>

Rep Rothman, Steve (D-NJ-9) - 202.225.5061
