On that day the financial services group's shares were trading at $39.80. Today they trade at more than $67 per share, offering Mr O'Neal a potential profit that is $5m greater than if the shares had been offered before the attacks.<P>Stock options are typically used by companies to reward executives. But the practice has come under scrutiny as it offers recipients the right to buy shares at the same price for years to come.<P>In the days after the 9/11 attacks, the US stock market closed and share prices fell 14%, the worst week for the Dow Jones Industrial Average since the Nazi invasion of France in 1940. It reopened on September 17 in a solemn ceremony.<P>That same day, the DIY retailer Home Depot issued a stock option to its recently appointed president Robert Nardelli that allowed him to purchase a million shares over 10 years at that day's price of $36.20. The share price on September 10, the day before the attacks, had been $40.55.<P>Companies defended the practice, saying the options were a way of calming and offering an incentive to executives in the tumultuous weeks after 9/11. Merrill Lynch denied that the timing of the offer was related to the attacks.
