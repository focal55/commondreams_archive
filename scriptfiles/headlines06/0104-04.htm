<p>BAGHDAD - A suicide bomber killed 36 people and wounded 40 at a Shi'ite funeral and gunmen ambushed a vital fuel convoy outside Baghdad amid a wave of attacks that made Wednesday Iraq's bloodiest day in weeks.</p><p>Car bombs also went off in the capital and in the recently peaceful Shi'ite holy city of Kerbala, suggesting a level of coordination that may be a response by Sunni Arab insurgents to last month's largely peaceful parliamentary election.</p><p>The funeral attack was the bloodiest single incident since the election. Some Sunni groups had declared an informal truce to encourage their community to vote and have been disappointed to see results handing continued domination to the Shi'ite Islamists and Kurds who have been in power for the past year.</p><p>The attack took place in Miqdadiya, 100 km (60 miles) northeast of the capital, where people were mourning a bodyguard to a local leader of the Dawa party, headed nationally by Shi'ite Islamist Prime Minister Ibrahim al-Jaafari.</p><p>Assailants fired mortars on the mourners, forcing them to take cover in the cemetery. A bomber wearing an explosive vest then blew up among them, security officials said.</p><p>Soon afterwards, rebels armed with rocket-propelled grenades and machineguns ambushed 60 fuel tankers on a road north of Baghdad, destroying 20 of them, police and oil officials said, saying the convoy's police escort was still fighting the attack.</p><p>There was no immediate word on casualties.</p><p>The convoy was part of a major government effort to ease fuel shortages in the capital following the recent closure of Iraq's main refinery at Baiji in the north; supplies were halted for 10 days because of threats to tanker drivers.</p><p>At least eight people were killed and 12 wounded when a car bomb exploded in southern Baghdad, police and hospital sources said. The car was parked close to a busy commercial market in the Doura district, they said.</p><p>Earlier, three people were killed when a car bomb went off in the Shi'ite district of Kadhimiya in the north of the city. The bombers defied a major security operation launched, police said, to find the kidnapped sister of the interior minister.</p><p>GOVERNMENT TALKS</p><p>The violence came as Shi'ite, Sunni and Kurdish politicians pledged to plow on with efforts to form a national unity government capable of stemming the bloodshed.</p><p>The area around Miqdadiya has seen mounting violence in recent weeks and security officials have said hardline Sunni Islamist groups such as al Qaeda have been increasingly active in the area.</p><p>While that area's inhabitants have grown used to such attacks, the blast in Kerbala, south of Baghdad, was a rarity of late -- the first of its kind in the Shi'ite holy city since December 2004 when a car bomb killed 12 and wounded 30.</p><p>Police said three civilians were injured.</p><p>In March 2004, coordinated suicide bombings during the annual religious festival of Ashura killed more than 90 people in Kerbala, an act blamed on Sunni militant Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, head of al Qaeda in Iraq.</p><p>But since then, the city has been relatively quiet. Any attack there is likely to have had some sectarian motive.</p><p>MUTUAL MISTRUST</p><p>Mistrust between Iraq's majority Shi'ite and minority Sunni Arab communities has been heightened by the results of last month's election, which some Sunni and secular leaders charge were rigged to favor the Shi'ites.</p><p>The Iraqi electoral commission has called in a panel of four international monitors to investigate those claims.</p><p>In the meantime, representatives of all the main parties have been holding bilateral meetings in the north with Iraq's Kurdish president, Jalal Talabani, and other senior Kurds.</p><p>All have agreed to meet again in Baghdad soon to try to forge a government tasked with halting the killings and abductions which have become part of daily life for millions of Iraqis since the U.S.-led invasion of 2003.</p><p>The latest prominent kidnap victim was the sister of Interior Minister Bayan Jabor, seized in Baghdad on Tuesday by gunmen who attacked her convoy and killed a driver and a bodyguard before whisking her away.</p><p>Iraqi security forces launched a major security operation to find her on Wednesday, closing two of the main bridges over the River Tigris linking the city center to the militarized Green Zone, which houses government buildings and the U.S. embassy.</p><p>Some parts of the city were closed to cars while traffic in other areas was much heavier than usual as police set up impromptu checkpoints.</p><p>The abduction came three months after Jabor's brother was kidnapped and held for one night.</p><p>Jabor, an Islamist Shi'ite, is a hate figure for Sunni Arab rebels and has strenuously denied their allegations that his ministry condones Shi'ite death squads targeting them.</p>
