<p>DENVER, Colorado - Ten Nobel Peace Prize laureates called for world peace Saturday and took direct aim at the United States, asking an enthusiastic crowd of 7,000 youth to demand the U.S. pull back its military, spread its wealth and offer aid to developing countries.

TEN NOBEL PEACE PRIZE WINNERS TAKE AIM AT US<br>
8 Nobel Peace Prize Laureates from around the world gathered for a picture at the University of Denver on Friday, Sept. 15, 2006 where they are participating in the <a href="http://www.peacejam.org/" target="_new">PeaceJam</a> conference that is scheduled to run through Sunday. From left back row: Archbishop Desmond Tutu, The Dalai Lama, Betty Williams; Front Row: Jody Williams, Rigoberta Menchu Tum, Adolfo Perez Esquivel, Shirin Ebadi and Malread Corrigan Maguire.

''After the painful events of September 11, I wish that America would have built a school in Afghanistan in the name of every victim,'' said Shirin Ebadi, an Iranian judge and 2003 Peace Prize recipient. ''When someone claims he has a vision from God to bring war to Iraq, this is a kind of terrorism.''

<P>Only the Dalai Lama, whose speech during the first public event of a three-day event at the University of Denver was interrupted when a fire alarm went off, didn't take a direct jab at the U.S.

<P>Instead the Dalai Lama called on the world to open itself to religious tolerance.

<P><a href="http://www.peacejam.org/" target="_new">PeaceJam</a>, a Colorado-based program in its 10th year, hosts conventions around the world, bringing teenagers together with Nobel laureates to talk about what they can do to promote peace. Founders Dawn Engle and Ivan Suvanjieff say the interaction between the teens and laureates can build a generation that will tackle the big issues of poverty, disease and war.

<P>One after the other Saturday night, the laureates thanked the crowd that rose to its feet before and after each speech, and then called on Americans to do something about their government's foreign policy. From efforts to close the border with Mexico, to Iraq, to arms exports, the Nobel laureates had words for the U.S. government.

<P>''Stand up. Take action,'' said Jody Williams, the 1997 recipient for her work opposing land mines, and the only American to take the stage. ''Don't try to bring democracy to people you don't understand through the barrel of a gun and leave them with civil war.''

<P>Even the Archbishop Desmond Tutu, who praised the United States for its fight against South Africa's apartheid and its history of justice and democracy, had stern words for the Bush administration.

<P>''You taught us about the rule of law,'' he said. ''You taught us no government worth its salt can subvert the rule of law. We believed you. That's part of what you have as a gift for the world. Then how can you commit Guantanamo Bay? Take back your country.... How about exporting some of your generosity instead of your bombs?''</div>
