<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p>The sportswear giant Adidas has reneged on its promise to demand the reinstatement of 33 workers dismissed from a big Indonesian supplier in a way the country's human rights commission has found to be illegal, Oxfam alleged yesterday.<P>Several top football players, including the World Cup captains of France, Zin&eacute;dine Zidane, and England, David Beckham, wear the German company's boots and promote footwear made at the Indonesian plant, Panarub.<P>"Adidas is the top sportswear sponsor at the World Cup," said an Oxfam campaigner, Kelly Dent. "But off the field the company deserves a red card for failing to support the human rights of workers. Oxfam has not seen any evidence that Adidas has put formal pressure on Panarub."<P>Oxfam alleges that Adidas promised to formally pressure Panarub, after Indonesia's human rights commission ruled on May 31, in a non-binding decision, that there were insufficient grounds to dismiss 33 workers after a one-day strike.<P>William Anderson, Adidas's regional head of social and environmental affairs, insisted that the company had not altered its position.<P>"We are continuing to support the [sacked] workers," he told the Guardian. "We have requested that the factory reinstate the workers and the factory has refused to act on our request."<P>He said Adidas was not willing to send Panarub, which supplies it with 650,000 pairs of shoes a year, a formal warning. "If we do and the company refuses to comply, we would have no choice but to terminate relations with them. Eleven thousand people could then lose their jobs."<P>No one from Panarub was available for comment yesterday.
