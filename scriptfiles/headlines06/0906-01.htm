<p>A U.S. civil liberties group asked a
federal judge on Tuesday to halt a contentious domestic spying
program that the U.S. government argues is essential to
national security.</p>
<p>In a hearing in Manhattan federal court, lawyers for the
Center for Constitutional Rights asked U.S. District Judge
Gerard Lynch to stop the National Security Agency's secret
telephone eavesdropping program, which was leaked to the media
last year.</p>
<p>President George W. Bush has acknowledged authorizing the
NSA shortly after the September 11 attacks to monitor
international phone calls and e-mails of U.S citizens without
obtaining warrants. Bush said the program was aimed solely at
suspected terrorists and their allies.</p>
<p>Lawyers for the civil rights group, who filed their lawsuit
in January, say the program violates freedom of speech,
protections against unreasonable searches and constitutional
checks on presidential power.</p>
<p>In court on Tuesday, lawyers for the group argued that the
spying program was unconstitutional because Bush did not seek
approval from Congress. They said existing law requires that
all such wiretaps be court approved.</p>
<p>Government lawyer Anthony Coppolino asked the judge to
dismiss the case. He said barring the program would be
"intruding on the president's power to undertake terrorist
surveillance."</p>
<p>The judge, who reserved his ruling, questioned the
government's arguments that the president had the power to
order the program without legislative approval.</p>
<p>"This is serious stuff that you are suggesting where you
say that because the president is the commander in chief . . .
that gives him the power to override Congress," he said. "Even
Julius Caesar didn't get to bring his armies back into Rome."</p>
<p>Coppolino responded that such surveillance was "as close to
the modern day battlefield as you can get. Where is al Qaeda
today . . . and what are they planning to hit us?"</p>

<p>In a similar case in Detroit last month, a federal judge
ruled that the warrantless surveillance program was
unconstitutional.</p>
<p>The issue may ultimately end up in the U.S. Supreme Court,
legal experts say.
