<p> It's a problem just about everyone who 
has anything to do with civil society faces every day. How very nice 
this work is, people will say. And how very boring.
They may not quite say the last bit, but you hear it in the tone in 
which they say the first. The verdict is almost universal; people will 
usually grant that civil society is useful, but rarely find it 
interesting.
<br><br>
Media, far more, is inclined to find civil society deadly dull. Evidence 
of that too, faces us every day; nobody dares to count the number of 
civil society stories in a newspaper or on television any given day, 
despite some recent and occasional improvement in appearance.
<br><br>
"We have good and bad experiences to draw on regarding our engagement 
with the media but generally, civil society organisations face a real 
challenge in trying to translate their issues and messages into a media 
friendly form," says Martin Sime, chief executive of the Scottish 
Council for Voluntary Organisations (SCVO) which is organising the civil 
society world assembly in Glasgow this week jointly with Civicus.
<br><br>

"Maybe we start from a slightly distrusting position but it is also true 
to say that some organisations and some campaigns have been very 
successful in winning hearts and minds through good use of the media," 
he says. "Better understanding all round is required."
<br><br>
The Live 8 concert in support of Africa last year was news -- on the 
back of celebrities, more than the cause itself. Few in civil society 
believe that kind of attention is good enough.
<br><br>
"Civil society is still not able to access and express its thoughts and 
actions in the media as it would be desirable," says IPS Director-
General Mario Lubetkin. But that is not just the responsibility of civil 
society, he says.
<br><br>
"I think it is partly the responsibility of civil society and partly of 
the media, which have failed to report correctly on this active 
international news protagonist. To cover big civil society events or 
campaigns like GCAP (Global Call for Action Against Poverty) meetings or 
Live 8 is not enough. Ongoing information mechanisms must be 
established."
<br><br>
The need for that is apparent from the speed with which African debts 
and poverty left the front pages, or even the inside pages, after pop 
stars Buno and Bob Geldof became otherwise engaged.
<br><br>
"I think there's a major disconnect between civil society and mainstream 
media," says Civicus secretary-general Kumi Naidoo. "That is why the 
role of alternative media providers like IPS is so critically 
important." No one denies that IPS has stayed with civil society 
concerns after the cameras around the celebrities at the Africa events 
of last year were switched off.
<br><br>
But civil society is not just about dire poverty in Africa or elsewhere. 
Increasingly, an expanding civil society is addressing people's concerns 
in all sorts of ways, everywhere. And the disconnect between media and 
civil society -- to the considerable extent there is one -- could in 
that measure be a disconnect between media and people themselves.
<br><br>
"All the main reporting in mainstream media focuses on government and 
business to the exclusion of issues that civil society organisations are 
concerned about," says Naidoo. "And if you think about it, it's a 
reflection of the undemocratic media environment that we actually have."
<br><br>
That is because mainstream media is not taking on people concerns 
enough, he says. "If we look at what people are most concerned about in 
the world today, people want poverty to be reduced, they want gender 
equality, they want the environment to be dealt with in a responsible 
way," Naidoo says.

<br><br>
But civil society is nevertheless making news more and more, Naidoo says.
<br><br>
"The issues that civil society is concerned about is penetrating 
through, like we saw how poverty actually was given the profile it got. 
But it should not have to be this sort of effort that civil society 
should have to undertake to make that happen. There should be much more 
insight and much more vision on the part of the mainstream media if 
indeed their brief and their intention is to report on the issues that 
the majority of people on the planet are concerned about."
<br><br>
It should not be IPS saying this, but the success of the Civicus world 
assembly will be measured partly by the extent to which news providers 
other than IPS report it.
