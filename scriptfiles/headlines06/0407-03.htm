<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><P>An environmental group challenged the Bush administration's new fuel 
economy standards for light trucks in federal court Thursday, saying the new 
requirements were not stringent enough and would only worsen global warming and 
the nation's oil addiction. 
<P>The Center for Biological Diversity asked the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of 
Appeals in San Francisco to review the legality of the rules announced last 
week by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration for sport utility 
vehicles and other light trucks from 2008 through 2011. The standard now 
requires the vehicles to achieve 21.6 mpg and is scheduled to rise to 22.2 mpg 
for 2007 models; under the new criteria, the requirement in 2011 would be 24.1 
mpg. 
<P>Both Transportation Secretary Norm Mineta and the Alliance of Automobile 
Manufacturers described the new standards as tough and challenging for the auto 
industry. But the environmental group said the government is flouting a 1975 
law that requires fuel economy standards to be set at the "maximum feasible 
level.'' 
<P>"The fuel efficiency increases are minuscule compared to what is possible 
with existing technology and the major reforms urgently needed to cut air 
pollution, combat global climate change and save money at the gas pump,'' said 
Peter Galvin, conservation director of the organization headquartered in 
Tucson. 
<P>A 38 mpg benchmark can be readily achieved by 2015, the organization said. 
It said the government, in its justification of the standards, had failed to 
mention the environmental impact of its decision to propose only a small 
increase in fuel economy. 
<P>Deborah Sivas, lawyer for the Center for Biological Diversity, said the 
government merely declared that its new standard would cause no environmental 
harm because it represents an increase in fuel efficiency over the current 
standard. She contended federal law requires the government to consider a 
reasonable range of alternatives, including technologically achievable 
miles-per-gallon requirements, and discuss the environmental consequences of 
choosing a lesser standard. 

<P>"We can't really have an informed public debate when that whole part of 
the discussion is truncated,'' Sivas said. 
<P>In comments submitted to the federal agency while it was considering the 
standards, the environmental group attacked the proposal on multiple grounds, 
including the lack of any discussion of its impact on global warming and the 
government's assumption that gasoline would cost between $1.51 and $1.58 per 
gallon from 2008 through 2011. As a result, the government seriously 
underestimated the benefits of greater fuel economy, the group said. 
<P>California's Attorney General Bill Lockyer has also attacked the new 
federal standards, in part because the Bush administration declared that 
California lacked authority to regulate motor vehicles' emissions of carbon 
dioxide and other greenhouse gases. Lockyer, who is defending California's 
first-in-the-nation law on greenhouse gases in a suit by automakers, has not 
yet decided whether to challenge the federal rules in court, said spokesman Tom 
Dresslar.
