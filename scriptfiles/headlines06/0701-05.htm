The Guantanamo camp may have only 30 to 40 "real" cases and the US detention center should be shut down by 2007, the president of the Belgian Senate, who headed a European inspection team there, said.

<p>Presenting her findings in Washington on behalf of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), Anne-Marie Lizi recommended the shutting down of the US "war on terror" detention center by end of 2007 because the actual number of dangerous detainees was low.

<p>"We have looked at all the categories of detainees: those who are supposed to be transferred, those who are valuable for procedure," Lizi told reporters.

<p>"The number of those, when you discuss it with the people in this jail, could move from 70 to a little more than 100 but not more. And in some cases, people say we could have only 30 to 40 real valuable cases," she said.

<p>Her report says Guantanamo now has some 460 detainees.

<p>The Supreme Court issued a landmark ruling Thursday against the US use of military tribunals for Guantanamo Bay detainees, but the verdict did not touch the detention center's future.

<p>The ruling has forced the US administration to rethink its strategy for the "war on terror" tribunals. <p align="center">&copy; 2006 Agence France Presse </p>
