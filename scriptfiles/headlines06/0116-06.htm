<font size="3">Thirty years ago, the scientist James Lovelock worked out that the Earth possessed a planetary-scale control system which kept the environment fit for life. He called it Gaia, and the theory has become widely accepted. Now, he believes mankind's abuse of the environment is making that mechanism work against us. His astonishing conclusion - that climate change is already insoluble, and life on Earth will never be the same again.<br>

<p> The world has already passed the point of no return for climate change, and civilisation as we know it is now unlikely to survive, according to James Lovelock, the scientist and green guru who conceived the idea of Gaia - the Earth which keeps itself fit for life. </p>

        <!--/endimage/-->In a profoundly pessimistic new assessment, published in today's 
  Independent, Professor Lovelock suggests that efforts to counter global 
  warming cannot succeed, and that, in effect, it is already too late.
</p>
<p>
  The world and human society face disaster to a worse extent, and on a faster 
  timescale, than almost anybody realises, he believes. He writes: " 
  Before this century is over, billions of us will die, and the few breeding 
  pairs of people that survive will be in the Arctic where the climate remains 
  tolerable."
</p>
<p>
  In making such a statement, far gloomier than any yet made by a scientist of 
  comparable international standing, Professor Lovelock accepts he is going 
  out on a limb. But as the man who conceived the first wholly new way of 
  looking at life on Earth since Charles Darwin, he feels his own analysis of 
  what is happening leaves him no choice. He believes that it is the 
  self-regulating mechanism of Gaia itself - increasingly accepted by other 
  scientists worldwide, although they prefer to term it the Earth System - 
  which, perversely, will ensure that the warming cannot be mastered.
</p>
<p>
  This is because the system contains myriad feedback mechanisms which in the 
  past have acted in concert to keep the Earth much cooler than it otherwise 
  would be. Now, however, they will come together to amplify the warming being 
  caused by human activities such as transport and industry through huge 
  emissions of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide (CO2 ).
</p>
<p>
  It means that the harmful consequences of human beings damaging the living 
  planet's ancient regulatory system will be non-linear - in other words, 
  likely to accelerate uncontrollably.

</p>
<p>
  He terms this phenomenon "The Revenge of Gaia" and examines it in 
  detail in a new book with that title, to be published next month.
</p>
<p>
  The uniqueness of the Lovelock viewpoint is that it is holistic, rather than 
  reductionist. Although he is a committed supporter of current research into 
  climate change, especially at Britain's Hadley Centre, he is not looking at 
  individual facets of how the climate behaves, as other scientists inevitably 
  are. Rather, he is looking at how the whole control system of the Earth 
  behaves when put under stress.
</p>
<p>
  Professor Lovelock, who conceived the idea of Gaia in the 1970s while 
  examining the possibility of life on Mars for Nasa in the US, has been 
  warning of the dangers of climate change since major concerns about it first 
  began nearly 20 years ago.
</p>
<p>
  He was one of a select group of scientists who gave an initial briefing on 
  global warming to Margaret Thatcher's Cabinet at 10 Downing Street in April 
  1989.
</p>

<p>
  His concerns have increased steadily since then, as evidence of a warming 
  climate has mounted. For example, he shared the alarm of many scientists at 
  the news last September that the ice covering the Arctic Ocean is now 
  melting so fast that in 2005 it reached a historic low point.
</p>
<p>
  Two years ago he sparked a major controversy with an article in The 
  Independent calling on environmentalists to drop their long-standing 
  opposition to nuclear power, which does not produce the greenhouses gases of 
  conventional power stations.
</p>
<p>
  Global warming was proceeding so fast that only a major expansion of nuclear 
  power could bring it under control, he said. Most of the Green movement 
  roundly rejected his call, and does so still.
</p>
<p>
  Now his concerns have reached a peak - and have a new emphasis. Rather than 
  calling for further ways of countering climate change, he is calling on 
  governments in Britain and elsewhere to begin large-scale preparations for 
  surviving what he now sees as inevitable - in his own phrase today, "a 
  hell of a climate", likely to be in Europe up to 8C hotter than it is 
  today.
</p>
<p>

  In his book's concluding chapter, he writes: "What should a sensible 
  European government be doing now? I think we have little option but to 
  prepare for the worst, and assume that we have passed the threshold."
</p>
<p>
  And in today's Independent he writes: "We will do our best to survive, 
  but sadly I cannot see the United States or the emerging economies of China 
  and India cutting back in time, and they are the main source of [CO2] 
  emissions. The worst will happen ..."
</p>
<p>
  He goes on: "We have to keep in mind the awesome pace of change and 
  realise how little time is left to act, and then each community and nation 
  must find the best use of the resources they have to sustain civilisation 
  for as long as they can." He believes that the world's governments 
  should plan to secure energy and food supplies in the global hothouse, and 
  defences against the expected rise in sea levels. The scientist's vision of 
  what human society may ultimately be reduced to through climate change is "
a broken rabble led by brutal warlords."
</p>
<p>
  Professor Lovelock draws attention to one aspect of the warming threat in 
  particular, which is that the expected temperature rise is currently being 
  held back artificially by a global aerosol - a layer of dust in the 
  atmosphere right around the planet's northern hemisphere - which is the 
  product of the world's industry.
</p>
<p>
  This shields us from some of the sun's radiation in a phenomenon which is 
  known as "global dimming" and is thought to be holding the global 
  temperature down by several degrees. But with a severe industrial downturn, 
  the aerosol could fall out of the atmosphere in a very short time, and the 
  global temperature could take a sudden enormous leap upwards.

</p>
<p>
  One of the most striking ideas in his book is that of "a guidebook for 
  global warming survivors" aimed at the humans who would still be 
  struggling to exist after a total societal collapse.
</p>
<p>
  Written, not in electronic form, but "on durable paper with 
  long-lasting print", it would contain the basic accumulated scientific 
  knowledge of humanity, much of it utterly taken for granted by us now, but 
  originally won only after a hard struggle - such as our place in the solar 
  system, or the fact that bacteria and viruses cause infectious diseases.
</p>
<p>
   <b>Rough guide to a planet in jeopardy </b>
</p>
<p>
  Global warming, caused principally by the large-scale emissions of 
  industrial gases such as carbon dioxide (CO2), is almost certainly the 
  greatest threat that mankind has ever faced, because it puts a question mark 
  over the very habitability of the Earth.

</p>
<p>
  Over the coming decades soaring temperatures will mean agriculture may 
  become unviable over huge areas of the world where people are already poor 
  and hungry; water supplies for millions or even billions may fail. Rising 
  sea levels will destroy substantial coastal areas in low-lying countries 
  such as Bangladesh, at the very moment when their populations are 
  mushrooming. Numberless environmental refugees will overwhelm the capacity 
  of any agency, or indeed any country, to cope, while modern urban 
  infrastructure will face devastation from powerful extreme weather events, 
  such as Hurricane Katrina which hit New Orleans last summer.
</p>
<p>
  The international community accepts the reality of global warming, supported 
  by the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. In its last report, 
  in 2001, the IPCC said global average temperatures were likely to rise by up 
  to 5.8C by 2100. In high latitudes, such as Britain, the rise is likely to 
  be much higher, perhaps 8C. The warming seems to be proceeding faster than 
  anticipated and in the IPCC's next report, 2007, the timescale may be 
  shortened. Yet there still remains an assumption that climate change is 
  controllable, if CO2 emissions can be curbed. Lovelock is warning: think 
  again.</p>
