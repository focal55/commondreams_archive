for the 1981 rape and murder of a teenage Lodi girl was postponed early
today when two anesthesiologists balked at their court-ordered assignment
to make sure Morales remained unconscious during the lethal injection.

San Quentin State Prison's warden quickly rescheduled the execution
for 7:30 tonight by eliminating the anesthesiologists' role and ordering
that Morales be put to death with one drug, the powerful barbiturate sodium
pentothal, instead of the three that the state has used since 1996. A
federal judge had given the state that option but officials had previously
rejected it, because it would take an estimated 30 to 45 minutes to kill
the inmate instead of the usual eight to 10 minutes.
<P>If Morales is not executed before midnight, when his death warrant
expires, a new execution date would be more than a month away.
<P>Morales, 46, of Stockton, was convicted of raping and murdering
17-year-old Terri Winchell, whose battered body was found in a vineyard in
a remote area of San Joaquin County in January 1981. Morales never denied
his guilt and said he had been recruited for the attack by his cousin. The
cousin is serving a life sentence.
<P>The delay in his execution angered Brian Chalk, Winchell's youngest
brother, who had come to San Quentin to watch Morales' scheduled 12:01 a.m.
execution.
<P>"Everybody's upset,'' said Chalk, 34, who plans to return tonight with
two of his three brothers. "I guess they're just going to have to pump him
full of poison one way or the other.''

<P>Morales' lead attorney, David Senior, was also angry, but on behalf of
his client. Senior, exiled in a room at the prison for hours to await word
of an execution that never came, said the prison officials and judges who
cobbled together a new set of rules for the execution didn't realize how
much pain they had caused.
<P>"I find their behavior to be reprehensible,'' he said. "It astounds me
that people are still willing to put up with it.''
<P>The postponement stemmed from confusion over the roles of two
anesthesiologists whose presence as safeguards against a botched execution
was ordered last week by U.S. District Judge Jeremy Fogel.
<P>Fogel said the state had to take steps to make sure Morales was
unconscious when injected with paralyzing and heart-stopping chemicals, the
final two drugs of the three-drug sequence that California has been using
for executions.
<P>The judge gave state officials two options: place a medical
professional in the execution chamber to determine that the prisoner was
rendered unconscious by the initial dose of sodium pentothal and did not
regain consciousness, or eliminate the second and third drugs and use only
sodium pentothal. The state says that drug is lethal in the five-gram dose
allotted for the execution.
<P>The state retained two private anesthesiologists, whose identities
were not made public, and proceeded with plans for the execution early this
morning. But shortly before 11:30 p.m., warden Steven Ornoski announced a
one-hour delay, saying prison staff and the anesthesiologists needed more
time to work out their assigned roles.
<P>Morales' lawyers then hurried to court seeking to block the execution,
saying the prison procedures failed to guarantee that the anesthesiologists
could intervene if something went wrong. Fogel and the Ninth U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals denied stays of execution within an hour, but by then the
anesthesiologists had determined that their roles were unacceptable.
<P>The apparent sticking point was the physicians' obligation, under
procedures specified by a federal appeals court in a ruling Sunday, to
intervene if Morales appeared to regain consciousness or displayed signs of
pain. The court said the anesthesiologists would then have to take steps to
render the inmate unconscious or "otherwise alleviate the painful effects''
of the drugs.
<P>"Any such intervention would clearly be medically unethical,'' the
doctors said in a written statement today. "As a result, we have withdrawn
from participation in this current process.''
<P>Morales appeared to have exhausted his last legal appeals Monday when
the U.S. Supreme Court refused to take his case. He spent the day largely
by himself, seeing only members of his legal team. A spokeswoman for the
state Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation described him as "very
cooperative and upbeat."
<P>Morales had no visits from family or friends Monday but said goodbye
to them by telephone after being taken to a death-watch cell near the
lethal injection chamber at 6 p.m., Crittendon said. He said Morales had
discouraged relatives from coming to see him.
<P>"He wanted to make clear to his loved ones that this is not
necessarily a sad affair,'' Crittendon said. "He wanted to be remembered
for the good times they had in the past, as opposed to the event that is
happening tonight.''
<P>Morales, whose lawyers said he had become devoutly religious in
prison, did not request the presence of a spiritual adviser, Jennings said.
<P>The Supreme Court's rejection came Monday afternoon. In one appeal,
Morales' lawyers argued that his conviction for capital murder was the
product of a jailhouse informant's false testimony that Morales had
admitted planning the killing. The federal appeals court dismissed that
appeal Sunday, saying the informant's testimony was corroborated by other
witnesses.
<P>The second appeal challenged the adequacy of Fogel's order last week
that required the state to put a medical professional in the death chamber.
The appeals court said Sunday that the two anesthesiologists whom the state
retained had all the authority they needed to stop the execution if Morales
was conscious and in pain. 
<P>After the Supreme Court rejection, Morales' lawyers made a final plea
to Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger to reconsider his denial of clemency. Kenneth
Starr, the former Whitewater special prosecutor who is on Morales' legal
team, noted that the judge who sentenced Morales to death in 1983 had
recently endorsed clemency. Starr said this would be the first time in
California history that a governor had spurned such a recommendation by the
trial judge.
<P>Three hours later, Schwarzenegger replied that he saw no reason to
reconsider.

<P>About 250 death penalty opponents gathered outside the prison. They
included retired Episcopal priest Lyle Grosjean of San Francisco, who had
led a group of about 15 people on foot across the Golden Gate Bridge.
<P>"We're against any gratuitous violence,'' said Grosjean, who has
protested executions at San Quentin since 1959. "The death penalty doesn't
have to happen.''
<P>Ruth Enero of Modesto, who accompanied Grosjean, said it was her 12th
execution-eve walk. "I know that executing Michael Morales does not do
anything to resurrect Terri Winchell,'' she said. 
<P>Morales was 21 when he murdered Winchell on Jan. 8, 1981. He was a
gangster and drug user with a record of petty crimes, had been kicked out
of his parents' home at 15, and had dropped out of high school and fathered
three children.
<P>According to trial testimony, his cousin Ricky Ortega recruited him to
attack Winchell, a popular high school senior with a straight-A average who
was an accomplished singer. Winchell's boyfriend was secretly in a
relationship with Ortega, who was gay.
<P>Morales' lawyers say the plan was not to kill Winchell but to frighten
her out of any thought of revealing Ortega's sexuality by briefly choking
her. But when he accompanied Ortega in a car to pick up Winchell, Morales,
high on PCP and cheap wine, carried not just a belt but also a claw hammer
and a 7-inch knife.
<P>In an isolated area north of Lodi, Morales, sitting in the back seat,
reached forward with his belt and started strangling Winchell, prosecution
witnesses said he told them. When the belt broke, he started hitting her in
the head with the hammer. 
<P>After 23 blows, he carried her, unconscious and dying, out of the car,
dragged her to a vineyard, raped her and stabbed her four times.
<P>Police tracked down Ortega the next day. He pointed them to Morales,
who confessed to investigators. 
<P>Morales was convicted in 1983 of two counts of capital murder: murder
by torture, which was overturned on appeal, and murder by lying in wait. 
<P>One prosecution witness was Morales' housemate, Patricia Flores, who
said Morales had practiced with his belt around her neck and had later
described the killing. An inmate who did time in jail with Morales, Bruce
Samuelson, testified that Morales had bragged about the murder, referred to
Winchell with sexual vulgarities, and asked him to kill Flores and another
witness. 
<P>Ortega, tried separately, was sentenced to life without the
possibility of parole.
<P>As his appeal wound through the courts, Morales became a changed man
in prison, according to friends and relatives. He resumed academic studies,
became religious and took up art, producing portraits and landscapes sold
in the prison store.
<P>"I've done my best over the years to strip off the old personality
with all its flaws and shameful practices, and put on a new personality.
One shaped by good morals and strong values,'' Morales said last month in a
letter to Schwarzenegger, part of his application for clemency.
<P>Morales' lawyers also cited Samuelson's statement 10 years after the
trial that he and Morales had discussed the crime in Spanish  --  proof
that the jailhouse informant's testimony was a lie, they said, because
Morales speaks no Spanish.
<P>That persuaded Morales' trial judge, Charles McGrath, to join the
appeal for clemency, saying he would have set aside the jury's death
verdict if he had known of the informant's falsehoods. 
<P>But claims that the death sentence was based on perjured testimony
failed to sway federal courts, which found no evidence that authorities had
deliberately planted Samuelson next to Morales or knowingly presented lies
to the jury.

<P>Morales would be the third prisoner put to death in a little more than
two months in California and the 14th since executions resumed in 1992
after a 25-year hiatus. 
<P>Dane Gillette, death penalty coordinator for state Attorney General
Bill Lockyer, said the recent cluster of executions did not signal a
speedup in the implementation of California's death penalty. Instead, he
said, it merely reflected the fact that a few cases more than 20 years old
cleared the federal courts around the same time.
<P>There are 644 other inmates on the state's Death Row, the nation's
largest. Only one other inmate's case has advanced far enough for a
possible execution date later this year, Gillette said	--  Mitchell Sims,
convicted of murdering a Domino's Pizza deliveryman in Glendale (Los
Angeles County) in 1986.
<P>Sims used to work for Domino's in South Carolina, and was also
sentenced to death in that state for killing two company employees before
he came to California.
