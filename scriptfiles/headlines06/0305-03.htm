<p>WHEN Major-General Axel Tüttelmann, the head of Nato’s Airborne Early Warning and Control Force, showed off an AWACS early warning surveillance plane in Israel a fortnight ago, he caused a flurry of concern back at headquarters in Brussels.
<p>It was not his demonstration that raised eyebrows, but what he said about NATO&#146;s possible involvement in any future military strike against Iran. &#147;We would be the first to be called up if the NATO council decided we should be,&#148; he said. 

<p>NATO would prefer the emphasis to remain on the &#147;if&#148;, but T&#252;ttelmann&#146;s comments revealed that the military alliance could play a supporting role if America launches airstrikes against Iranian nuclear targets. 
<p>The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) will tomorrow confirm Iran&#146;s referral to the United Nations Security Council for possible sanctions. 
<P>Iran insists it is developing peaceful nuclear energy, a claim regarded as bogus by America and Britain, France and Germany, which believe it wants to develop nuclear weapons. President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad&#146;s remarks about wiping Israel &#147;off the map&#148; have added to fears. 
<P>America and Israel have warned that they will not tolerate a nuclear-armed Iran. If negotiations fail, both countries have plans of last resort for airstrikes against Iran&#146;s widely dispersed nuclear facilities. 
<P>Porter Goss, the head of the CIA, visited Recep Erdogan, the prime minister of Turkey, a NATO country, late last year and asked for political, logistical and intelligence support in the event of airstrikes, according to western intelligence sources quoted in the German media. 
<P>The news magazine Der Spiegel noted: &#147;Washington appears to be dispatching high-level officials to prepare its allies for a possible attack.&#148; 

<P>NATO would be likely to operate air defences in Turkey, according to Dan Goure, a Pentagon adviser and vice-president of the Lexington Institute, a military think tank. 
<P>A former senior Israeli defence official said he believed all NATO members had contingency plans. 
<P>John Pike, director of the US military studies group Globalsecurity.org, said America had little to gain from NATO military help. &#147;I think we are attempting to bring the alliance along politically so that when all diplomatic initiatives have been exhausted and we blow up their sites, we can say, &#145;Look, we gave it our best shot&#146;.&#148; 
<P>A senior British defence official said plans to attack Iran were pure speculation. &#147;I don&#146;t think anybody has got that far yet,&#148; he said. &#147;We&#146;re all too distracted by Iraq.&#148; 
<P>Israel&#146;s special forces are said to be operating inside Iran in an urgent attempt to locate the country&#146;s secret uranium enrichment sites. &#147;We found several suspected sites last year but there must be more,&#148; an Israeli intelligence source said. They are operating from a base in northern Iraq, guarded by Israeli soldiers with the approval of the Americans, according to Israeli sources. 

<P>The commander of Israel&#146;s nuclear missile submarines warned Iran indirectly in a comment to an Israeli newspaper last week that &#147;we are able to hit strategic targets in a foreign country&#148;. 
<P>The Israelis fear Iran may reach the &#147;point of no return&#148; &#151; at which it has the capacity to enrich uranium to bomb-grade purity &#151; in the next few months. The Americans are more interested in the point at which Iran is close to developing an actual bomb, thought to be at least three years away. 
<P>Two Iranian opposition groups claimed this weekend that Iran had increased its production of Shahab 3 missiles, which have a range of 1,200 miles, sufficient to reach Israel. 
<P>Diplomatic efforts to contain Iran are likely to proceed slowly, given Russian and Chinese opposition to punitive action. A Foreign Office official said although the IAEA would refer Iran to the security council, any sanctions would be a &#147;strictly step-by-step process&#148;.
