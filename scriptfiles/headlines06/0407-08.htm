<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p>Germany's parliament gave the green
light on Friday for a parliamentary inquiry into whether German
spies in Baghdad helped the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003 at a
time when the government was publicly opposed to the war.
<p>Lawmakers voted to approve the probe, which will examine
various sensitive aspects of the security services' work and
their cooperation with the United States.</p>
<p>It will also look into the Central Intelligence Agency's
alleged abduction of a German national and secret transfer of
at least one terrorist suspect via Germany.</p>
<p>The government of conservative Chancellor Angela Merkel had
previously argued in vain that the investigation would be a
time-wasting distraction that would stir up anti-American
feeling at a time when Berlin is trying to repair U.S. ties.</p>
<p>But the three opposition parties teamed up to force the
inquiry after a spate of media reports alleging that two German
agents in Baghdad helped the United States launch its invasion,
including by picking out bombing targets.</p>
<p>Questions for the inquiry include whether ministers or
officials knew and approved of the handing of information to
the Americans, and of the details that were passed on.</p>
<p>Among those who may face pressure are Foreign Minister
Frank-Walter Steinmeier, who at the time was chief of staff and
intelligence coordinator under Merkel's predecessor, Social
Democrat Gerhard Schroeder.</p>
<p>SOME INTELLIGENCE PASSED ON</p>
<p>The issue is controversial in Germany because public
opinion strongly opposed the Iraq war.</p>

<p>Schroeder, won an election in 2002 on the back of his
public opposition to any military "adventure" in Iraq.</p>
<p>Merkel's conservative-Social Democrat coalition government
has acknowledged that some intelligence from the two agents was
passed on to the United States, including information on the
Iraqi police and military presence in Baghdad.</p>
<p>But it says they played no role in selecting bombing
targets, except to warn the Americans against hitting civilian
sites such as hospitals.</p>
<p>Merkel herself is not under fire because her party was in
opposition at the time. But by keeping the Iraq war in the
headlines, the inquiry could hinder her efforts to turn over a
new leaf in relations with Washington, which were badly
strained by Schroeder's opposition to the invasion.
