Andrus, carrying a shepherd's staff and singing "Down by the Riverside,'' 
was among about 200 protesters who had marched from Grace Cathedral on Nob Hill 
to join the weekly anti-war rally on Golden Gate Avenue near City Hall. 
<P>The bishop celebrated communion at the entrance plaza before Federal 
Protective Service officers began arresting protesters shortly after 2 p.m. for 
lying down and blocking the two main doors. 
<P>The officers passed Andrus in their first round of arrests because he was 
not positioned in front of the doors. After Andrus, in his purple robe, got up, 
moved a few steps and lay down again directly in front of the entrance, the 
officers returned and placed him in handcuffs  --  while one said, "How are 
you?'' and shook the cleric's hand. 
<P>Protesters applauded, cheered and sang as Andrus was photographed by 
another officer and led inside the building. 
<P>"God is with all who have suffered in Iraq,'' the bishop said. "This war 
needs to be opposed. Even though there is widespread sentiment against the war, 
we need to continue to push for peace. There is good reason to believe this is 
an unjust war.'' 

<P>Andrus became the eighth bishop of the 80-congregation Episcopal Diocese 
of California in July. 
<P>Eleven other protesters were arrested for blocking the door. All were 
cited and released. A half-dozen other people who lay down in front of the door 
got up and left when the crowd began to disperse and it was clear that the 
officers were all done arresting people. 
<P>"What do you have to do to get arrested in this town?' said Matt Cantor, 
in exasperation. "The war in Iraq is horrible, unthinkable, and we cannot stand 
by while children are dying.'' 
<P>"Well, the bishop got arrested,'' said Cathy Lipscomb, another nonarrested 
door blocker. "That was the important thing."  
<P>Several hundred people crowded into the plaza for the rally and religious 
service, the biggest turnout for the protest and vigil that has been held 
weekly in front of the federal building for about five years.  
<P>In another anti-war protest Thursday, several dozen students at Stanford 
University drew chalk outlines representing the Iraq war dead at major 
locations around campus, including the library and post office.
