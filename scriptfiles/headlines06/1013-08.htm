        <!--/endimage/-->But acting now will avoid some of the massive damage and
cost relatively little, said the study commissioned by Friends
of the Earth from the Global Development and Environment
Institute of Tufts University in the United States.</p>
<p>"The climate system has enormous momentum, as does the
economic system," said co-author Frank Ackerman. "We have to
start turning off greenhouse gas emissions now in order to
avoid catastrophe in decades to come."</p>
<p>The study said the cost of inaction by governments and
individuals could hit 11 trillion pounds a year by 2100, or six
to eight percent of global economic output then.</p>
<p>Most scientists now agree average temperatures will rise by
between two and six degrees Celsius by the end of the century,
driven by so-called greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide from
burning fossil fuels for power and transport.</p>
<p>Already at two degrees they predict a massive upsurge in
species loss and extreme weather events like storms, droughts
and floods, threatening millions of lives. Polar icecaps will
melt, raising sea levels by several meters.</p>
<p>Beyond that, the world enters into the unknown with the
possible shutdown of the life-giving Gulf Stream and possibly
catastrophic runaway change due to so-called climate feedback.</p>
<p>By contrast, spending just 1.6 trillion pounds a year now
to limit temperature rises to two degrees could avoid annual
economic damage of around 6.4 trillion pounds, the Tufts report
said.</p>
<p>CHALLENGE</p>

<p>The report came the day after oil major Shell said business
should see the challenge of climate change as a chance to make
billions of pounds due to the demand for new technologies and
products to slash carbon emissions.</p>
<p>"For business, tackling climate change is both a necessity
and a huge opportunity. We have to step up to the challenge,"
Shell UK chairman James Smith said.</p>
<p>The British government is in the closing stages of a
ground-breaking global study of the economic costs of climate
change which is expected to be published within the next two
weeks stressing the massive costs of inaction.</p>
<p>During a debate in parliament on Thursday Environment
Minister David Miliband said the problem was worse than
previously thought and the sternest challenge faced by mankind.</p>
<p>"Preventing the transformation of the earth's atmosphere
from greenhouse to unconstrained hothouse represents arguably
the most imposing scientific and technical challenge that
humanity has ever faced," he said.</p>
<p>"It is local, national and international. It will affect
all of us as well as all our children," he added.</p>
<p>Britain is set to meet its Kyoto target of cutting carbon
emissions by 12 million tones by 2012, but the government is
under pressure from opposition parties and environment groups
to introduce laws setting enforceable national reduction
targets.</p><p align="center"> Copyright &copy; 2006 Reuters Limited</p>
