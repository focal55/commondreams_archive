<p>

Just a few years ago, this was considered a risky career move, but now rocking against the war is, quite literally, all the rage.</p>
<p>
Perhaps the most acidic anti-war songs today are coming from an old hand. In the 1960s and '70s, Neil Young raged against the Vietnam War.</p>
<p>
Now he has a new album, "Living With War," filled with songs like "Let's Impeach the President."  Young says he's never made a record that produced more anger -- or more appreciation.</p>
<p>
"I have people holding me by the shoulders with tears in their eyes thanking me for saying these things," he told ABC News.</p>
<p>
That a major record label put out this album signals a real cultural shift. In 2003, the Dixie Chicks were bashed and boycotted for criticizing the president.</p>
<p>
Today, the Dixie Chicks have a hit record.</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, anti-war songs are pouring in from all corners of the musical spectrum -- including country legends such as Merle Haggard, classic rockers such as Bruce Springsteen, pop stars such as Pink, rappers such as KRS-One and punk rockers such as Green Day and Anti-Flag.</p>
<p>
"We're trying to get a reaction out of people," said Justin Sane of Anti-Flag. "Even if people don't agree with what we say, we're trying to get people to think."</p>
<p>The proliferation of protest songs is reminiscent of the Vietnam era. But there's one big difference: Today, the musical movement is not accompanied by a mass movement against the war.</p>
<p>
"The question is: Why haven't these musicians written the right song to start the movement?" says Dave Marsh, a rock historian. "And the answer to that is: That's not what songs do. What songs do is not start things. What songs do is help sustain them."</p>
<p>
With a few notable exceptions, most of today's protest songs have not been big hits. It's also worth noting that, while the Dixie Chicks do have a hit record, they've had to cancel concerts in the South and Midwest, where some radio stations still refuse to play their songs.</p>
