        <!--/endimage/-->Because plastic doesn't break down the way organic material
does, ocean currents and tides have carried it thousands of
miles (kms) to an area between Hawaii and the U.S. West Coast,
according to the study by the international environmental group
Greenpeace.</p>
<p>This swirling vortex, which can grow to be about the size
of Texas, is not far from the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands,
designated as a protected U.S. national monument in June by
President George W. Bush.</p>
<p>The Greenpeace report, "Plastic Debris in the World's
Oceans" said at least 267 species -- including seabirds,
turtles, seals, sea lions, whales and fish -- are known to have
suffered from entanglement or ingestion of marine debris.</p>
<p>Some 80 percent of this debris comes from land and 20
percent from the oceans, the report said, with four main
sources: tourism, sewage, fishing and waste from ships and
boats.</p>
<p>The new report comes days after the journal Science
projected that Earth's stocks of fish and seafood would
collapse by 2048 if trends in overfishing and pollution
continue.</p>
<p>Two weeks ago, the U.S. Institute of Medicine said the
benefits of eating fish outweigh the risks of toxins detected
in the animals.</p>
<p>STOMACHS FILLED WITH PLASTIC</p>
<p>Plastic pollution is a problem in all the world's oceans,
the Greenpeace report said, but underlined the issue in the
Pacific by sailing through the floating garbage dump and
capturing images of wildlife interacting with plastic.</p>

<p>"It's not necessarily an area that's clearly defined; it's
sort of a natural phenomenon ... wind and salt water break down
the plastic," said Steve Smith, aboard the Greenpeace ship
Esperanza.</p>
<p>The plastic trash, some in large pieces and others broken
down to small but recognizable particles, is visible from the
ship's deck, about 50 feet above the ocean surface, Smith said
by telephone on Friday. Inflatable boats are dispatched from
the ship to collect samples.</p>
<p>"We've been unfortunately finding a lot of stuff out here,
floating by, which doesn't paint a very good picture, because
some of it is from faraway places, has marine life like
barnacles and other little creatures living on the plastic,"
Smith said.</p>
<p>By hitching rides on plastic debris, invasive species can
be carried thousands of miles (kms) to interact with native
creatures, Smith said. Plastic also poses a hazard to animals
that mistake it for prey and eat it, he said.</p>
<p>"Plastics in the oceans act as a toxic sponge, soaking up a
lot of the persistent pollutants out here," Smith said. "We've
seen photos of albatrosses who eat this plastic ... Even though
their stomachs are filled, they end up starving because there's
no nutrients in there."</p>
<p>Discarded or lost fishing nets and traps can continue to
catch fish when they are no longer in use, the report said.</p>
<p>The report said an international agreement known as MARPOL
is aimed at ending the dumping of plastic debris at sea, but
noted that since most debris originates on land, even total
enforcement of this agreement would not eliminate the problem.</p>
<p>Greenpeace called for a global network of marine reserves,
covering 40 percent of the world's oceans, and responsibility
by coastal countries to cut down on "excessive consumption" and
boost recycling.
