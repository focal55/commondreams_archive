In a rebuke of one of the Bush administration's first environmental 
policies, a federal judge has overturned a rule that would have allowed roads 
to be built through nearly 60 million acres of national forest land, including 
4.4 million acres in California. 
<P>The decision, announced Wednesday, came as several states were preparing 
to allow road construction on untouched wildlands, opening them to activities 
like logging, mining and driving off-road vehicles. 
<P>U.S. District Judge Elizabeth D. Laporte ruled that the policy ignored 
both the National Environmental Policy Act and the U.S. Endangered Species Act. 
Laporte reinstituted a Clinton administration policy implemented in 2001 that 
prohibited new roads on some pristine wildlands, including large swaths in the 
Inyo and Stanislaus national forests.  
<P>It is unclear whether the administration will appeal the decision or will 
draft a new plan that will undergo extensive environmental review. 
<P>Conservationists said the decision vindicated their contention that the 
Bush rule was an attempt to log and mine public lands by illegally overturning 
the Clinton policy. 
<P>"It's a great ruling," said Sean Cosgrove, the Sierra Club's national 
forestry policy specialist. "It shows the strength of the 2001 rule, which was 
based on real science and extensive public input." 
<P>But critics of the roadless rules argue that Laporte's ruling does nothing 
to break a long-standing logjam over national forest policy. 
<P>"We've been going over this thing for the eight years of the Clinton 
administration and six years with Bush, and what do we have to show for it?" 
said David Bischel, president of the California Forestry Association. "We're 
basically back to square one." 

<P>The 2001 Roadless Area Conservation Rule attempted to settle the matter 
definitively. It banned new roads on 58.5 million acres of national forest land 
--  49.2 million in the continental United States and 9.3 million acres of 
Alaska's Tongass National Forest. A U.S. Forest Service spokesman said 
Wednesday that it's unclear whether the Tongass forest is affected by Laporte's 
decision. 
<P>The acreage protected under the 2001 policy represents 2 percent of the 
nation's total land area and 31 percent of national forest land.  
<P>The Clinton roadless policy stayed in effect for roughly two years until 
it was voided by a permanent injunction issued by U.S. District Judge Clarence 
Brimmer in Wyoming. Brimmer said the Clinton rule violated the National 
Environmental Protection Act and the U.S. Wilderness Act because, among other 
things, it didn't include an adequate range of alternatives. 
<P>The Bush administration decided not to challenge Brimmer's ruling and 
instead issued its own rules that allowed states to petition the federal 
government to institute their own plans for national forest roadless areas.  
<P>David Tenny, a deputy undersecretary for the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture, said six states  --  Idaho, California, New Mexico, Virginia, 
North Carolina and South Carolina  --  had already filed petitions for roadless 
area management, and Colorado had a petition pending. The USDA oversees the 
Forest Service. 
<P>The states' plans vary widely, although California's plan, submitted by 
Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, hewed closely to the Clinton rule, Tenny said. 
<P>"We intend to keep cooperating with the states on this issue. We've had 
great success so far  --  we just have to figure out how to proceed," Tenny 
said. 
<P>Paul Weiland, a former Justice Department attorney who worked on issues 
related to the Bush rule, said the administration could appeal or do the 
extensive environmental studies to support its policy. 
<P>"One thing is clear, though  --  there's going to be no quick fix. If they 
challenge the decision, it's going to take time," Weiland said. 
<P>Opponents of the Clinton rule expressed frustration over Laporte's 
decision. 
<P>"It's a travesty, a sham," said Edward Waldheim, president of the 
California Off-Road Vehicle Association. 
<P>"What (Bush rule opponents) are doing is taking areas with no real 
wilderness characteristics and making wilderness areas out of them," Waldheim 
said. "Trails we now use will be shut off. And it won't stop until they 
completely lock the American people out of public lands." 
<P>But environmentalists like Steve Holmer of the United Forest Defense 
Campaign say the 2001 rules were written after one of the most extensive public 
input processes ever undertaken by the federal government, resulting in more 
than a million comments supporting roadless area protections. 
<P>"I think the fight is going to continue because the Bush administration 
remains determined to open up these last wild areas," Holmer said. "But 
(Laporte's) ruling indicates we're getting back on track. This is a good day 
for us."
