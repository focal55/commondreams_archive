        <b>HOW TONY BLAIR MISLED THE NATION</b><p>
  On 28 February 2005, with the Prevention of Terrorism Bill being discussed 
  in Parliament, Tony Blair made the following comment to listeners to Women's 
  Hour: "What they [the security services] say is that you have got to 
  give us powers in between mere surveillance of these people - there are 
  several hundred of them in this country who we believe are engaged in 
  plotting or trying to commit terrorist acts - you have got to give us power 
  in between just surveying them and being sure enough to prosecute them 
  beyond reasonable doubt. There are people out there who are determined to 
  destroy our way of life and there is no point in us being na&iuml;ve about it.
"
</p>
<p>
  Anyone listening to the Prime Minister's remarks must have felt that, within 
  days of the Prevention of Terrorism Act being passed, the "several 
  hundred" individuals plotting to wreak devastation through Britain 
  would have been under lock and key. And yet that is not the case at all. 
  Nearly a year has gone by and yet no more than 17 individuals have been made 
  subject to control orders. The Prime Minister's suggestion that the security 
  services were demanding new powers in order to deal with a new category of 
  terrorist suspect turns out to have been nonsense. His figure of " 
  several hundred" terrorists plotting mayhem seems to have been plucked 
  out of thin air.
</p>
<p>

   <b>THE POLITICISATION OF TERROR</b>
</p>
<p>
  In the immediate aftermath of the 7 July outrages the Home Secretary, 
  Charles Clarke, was swift to make contact with his opposite numbers the 
  shadow Home Secretary, David Davis, and the Liberal Democrat home affairs 
  spokesman, Mark Oaten. Parallel lines of communication were developed 
  between their staff members and cemented by a regular exchange of letters 
  and e-mails. There seemed to be a real chance that some good could come out 
  of the calamity of the London bombings: politicians of all parties coming 
  together to fight a ruthless common enemy.
</p>
<p>
  By the start of August, there was a general agreement that everything was on 
  course for announcements at the party conference season and the passing of 
  an anti-terrorism Act, with cross-party support, by Christmas. Clarke, Davis 
  and Oaten each set off on holiday. They had taken the precaution of sharing 
  contact numbers in case of an emergency.
</p>
<p>
  On the afternoon of 4 August, both Oaten and Davis were surprised to receive 
  a call from the Home Office minister Hazel Blears. Oaten was in St Tropez 
  when he took his, while Davis was in the north of England. According to 
  both, Blears gave the impression that the call was little more a formality. 
  She told them that there would be an announcement on terrorism by the Prime 
  Minister the following day, but it would not go further than had already 
  been agreed between the three parties.
</p>
<p>

  The following day, in his monthly Downing Street press conference, the Prime 
  Minister went far beyond anything agreed, or even discussed with, the 
  opposition parties. He dramatically announced a "12-point plan" 
  which put forward new measures which he surely knew that the opposition 
  parties could not support. This 12-point plan at once shattered the 
  harmonious working relationship between the three main parties.
</p>
<p>
  Charles Clarke, it must be said, rebuts any suggestion that he was put under 
  pressure from Downing Street or kept out of loop, saying: "I was on 
  holiday in America at that time, and I was on the phone to the Prime 
  Minister a great deal during that time, right up to the statements that he 
  actually made. I was fully involved, fully supported it and thought it was 
  the right thing to do." Be that as it may, there are grounds for 
  speculation that 10 Downing Street had seized control of the terrorism 
  agenda from the Home Office.
</p>
<p>
  The context is important: the Prime Minister had been confronted by a 
  concerted campaign in the tabloid press for new anti-terror laws. He may 
  well have concluded that the thoughtful, consensual strategy worked out with 
  the two main opposition parties came at too great a political cost. He may 
  have decided that it was more profitable to give an impression of acting 
  tough. That was the impression gained by many MPs, including his own 
  supporters. John Denham, a former Home Office minister and chairman of the 
  Home Affairs Committee, described the proposals as "half-baked". 
  He told me later: "There must be concern that the Government agenda is 
  sometimes driven by public and media pressure in this area, rather than a 
  concern for what is most effective."
</p>
<p>
  Tony Blair's terror initiative showed numerous signs of having been cobbled 
  together in a hurry. Some of the measures proved ill thought-out and 
  unworkable. However, it may have achieved the result that the Prime 
  Minister, who left the following day for the West Indies to stay at Cliff 
  Richard's holiday home, wanted. For days before the plan was announced, he 
  had been under heavy pressure from a tabloid campaign, led by The Sun, 
  claiming that holidaying politicians were not taking the terror threat 
  seriously enough.
</p>
<p>
  On 3 August, The Sun raged against holidaying MPs: "LET'S HOPE THE 
  BOMBERS ARE ON HOLIDAY TOO". On 5 August an open letter from Trevor 
  Kavanagh, political editor of The Sun, was headlined: "DEAR MPs, SIX 
  WEEKS HOLIDAY IS ENOUGH FOR ANYONE". Then on 6 August, as Tony Blair 
  flew to the West Indies with his family, The Sun headline was much more 
  reassuring: "VICTORY FOR SUN OVER NEW TERROR LAWS."

</p>
<p>
   <b>RICIN</b>
</p>
<p>
  In early 2003 just as the Government was seeking to persuade the British 
  people to wage war against Saddam Hussein in order to prevent him 
  distributing weapons of mass destruction to terrorists, the police made a 
  significant announcement. They had, they said, foiled a terrorist ring in 
  its attempt to launch a chemical attack in Britain using the deadly poison 
  ricin.
</p>
<p>
  According to a press release from Scotland Yard issued in the names of the 
  deputy chief medical officer, Dr Pat Troop, and Assistant Commissioner David 
  Veness of the Metropolitan Police, ricin had been found in a flat in Wood 
  Green, north London. The Government latched on to the news. On 7 January, 
  the Home Secretary, David Blunkett, and the Health Secretary, John Reid, 
  issued a joint statement stating that "traces of ricin" had been 
  found. The Prime Minister joined in by warning that the discovery 
  highlighted the dangers from weapons of mass destruction, adding: "The 
  arrests which were made show this danger is present and real and with us 
  now. Its potential is huge."
</p>
<p>
  It is unusual, and potentially prejudicial, for ministers to comment on 
  upcoming court cases. Nevertheless, as the ricin case moved towards trial, 
  ministers continued to regard the ricin trial as an important publicity 
  resource. In due course, the trial judge was provoked into warning the Home 
  Secretary to curb his public remarks for fear of prejudicing the case.

</p>
<p>
  No ricin was ever found in the Wood Green flat - just a small number of 
  ingredients for the manufacture of ricin. The announcement from David Veness 
  and Pat Troop that "a small amount of the material recovered from the 
  Wood Green premises has tested positive for the presence of ricin poison"
 was misleading: the tests were only capable of indicating that ricin might be 
  present. But they did not establish its presence.
</p>
<p>
  On 7 January, chemical weapons experts at the government research facility 
  at Porton Down carried out more accurate tests into the presence of ricin. 
  These tests established that there was no ricin. Curiously, Porton Down 
  apparently did not pass on this information to the British Government until 
  late March. And apparently the Government never asked for the results of 
  this definitive test. The existence of ricin continued to be proclaimed for 
  over two years.
</p>
<p>
   <b>OLD TRAFFORD</b>
</p>
<p>
  In April 2004, the British people were alerted to an amazing coup. They 
  learned how the police had seized a terrorist gang just as it prepared to 
  launch an audacious bomb attack on Old Trafford stadium on match day, an 
  attack which could have killed thousands of people. It was a national 
  sensation. And yet there was not a shred of truth in the story. Unlike in 
  the ricin case, the Government cannot be blamed. The police and, to an 
  extent the media, are responsible for the invention.

</p>
<p>
  On the morning of Monday 19 April 2004, more than 400 officers from four 
  police forces, many of them armed, raided half a dozen houses, flats and 
  businesses in and around Manchester. They arrested eight men, one woman and 
  a 16-year-old boy. They were held for several days and intensively 
  interrogated. In due course the suspects were released. No charges were ever 
  laid.
</p>
<p>
  The newspapers, by contrast, had no doubt about what the story was. The 
  front page of The Sun proclaimed: "MAN U SUICIDE BOMB PLOT". On 
  pages four and five the paper claimed: "EXCLUSIVE: MAN UTD SUICIDE 
  BLASTS FOILED".
</p>
<p>
  Once the story had started to run, it was further fuelled by the Manchester 
  police. Rather than issue a cool denial, they played it up by holding a 
  press conference. The accompanying press release read: "We are 
  confident that the steps that we have taken to date have significantly 
  reduced any potential threat in the Greater Manchester area." With the 
  weekend fixtures looming, it went on: "Greater Manchester Police and 
  Manchester United Football Club have put in place extra security measures to 
  reassure the public about the safety of both matches."
</p>
<p>
  The police and security services have, very properly, refused to discuss 
  what intelligence led to the raids of 19 April being made. But the police 
  interrogations of the suspects shed a ray of light. One of the suspects, a 
  Kurd, suffered so badly from having his name linked to a terrorist plot that 
  he wants to remain anonymous.
</p>

<p>
  He told me how Old Trafford had cropped up in his interrogation: "I was 
  in the police station and the interview stopped, like a rest, and somebody, 
  they bring in the coffee and they ask me what you like? I say I like the 
  football. Oh, who do you support? They ask me just like a friendly, who do 
  you support? I say Manchester United. Oh, how long you support Manchester 
  United? I said a long time I support Manchester United, when I was tiny, I 
  was small, you know and all my family supported Manchester United ... they 
  asked me, have you been football ground? I said, of course I've been to the 
  football ground. Two years ago, long time ago, I can't remember."
</p>
<p>
  These questions were surely prompted by the discovery, at the anonymous 
  suspect's flat, of Manchester United paraphernalia: a poster of Old 
  Trafford, and ticket stubs the suspect had kept as souvenirs of his only 
  visit to the ground, when he had gone with a friend to watch United play 
  Arsenal the year before.
</p>
<p>
  The two friends had bought their tickets from touts, which meant that they 
  sat at different parts of the ground. The Sun reported that the bombers 
  planned to sit at different parts of the ground, in order to cause maximum 
  damage with their bombs. This claim can only have been based on the fact 
  that the old ticket stubs found by the police were for seats in different 
  parts of the stadium. This information had not been made public, so The Sun 
  could only have obtained it from the police.
</p>
<p>
  The Kurds I spoke to had come to Britain in order to escape the brutality of 
  Saddam Hussein's regime. Perhaps their most meaningful emotional connection 
  with Britain was a love for Manchester United, which was why they kept the 
  souvenirs in their flat. The Manchester police discovered nothing else 
  suspicious. Nevertheless the police probably viewed the Manchester United 
  souvenirs as potential evidence of a bomb plot. This evidence was then 
  prematurely leaked, through unofficial police sources, to the press.
</p>
<p>

  Manchester police then encouraged the story to run by issuing public 
  statements that, while falling a long way short of giving outright 
  confirmation, could be read as corroborating the story. Disgracefully, the 
  Greater Manchester Police refused to launch an investigation into the 
  numerous leaks.
</p>
<p>
  The reporting of this incident was inflammatory and misleading. It caused 
  needless alarm among millions of TV viewers and newspaper readers. It 
  stirred up anti-Islamic prejudice. It ruined the lives of several of the 
  suspects. They lost their homes, their jobs and their friends as a result. 
  They have never received a personal apology, either from the police or from 
  the press.
</p>
<p>
   <b>MUSLIM WORKING GROUPS</b>
</p>
<p>
  In the wake of the London bombings, the Prime Minister made a series of 
  announcements aimed at averting another catastrophe. One of the most visible 
  was the setting up of seven task forces to investigate Muslim extremism and 
  to recommend initiatives for tackling it. This was a considerable enterprise 
  by any standards, requiring deep learning and insight, and generous 
  resources.
</p>
<p>

  But Tony Blair's task forces into the roots of Muslim extremism were given 
  six weeks to do their business. They seem to have met just three times 
  before reaching their conclusions. One of the Muslim leaders involved, the 
  Liberal Democrat peer Kishwer Falkner, told us: "When we agreed to be 
  on the working groups and we were told what the deadlines were, we were 
  taken aback. We spoke to one another and queried whether we were just being 
  set up as a tokenistic exercise, because it didn't seem to me, in the middle 
  of August, when half the country is on holiday, that two or three meetings 
  of a couple of hours each would set right a host of intractable and 
  difficult long-term problems to do with how we co-exist, how we integrate 
  with each other.
</p>
<p>
  Falkner feels that the recommendation of her working parties were 
  second-guessed by the Prime Minister's 12-point plan, announced just two 
  weeks after the working parties were set up. She says she was: "... 
  completely dismayed, within days of being set up, to discover in the speech 
  the Prime Minister made on 5 August, that he was proceeding full steam ahead 
  with a raft of measures without waiting for us to come up with our 
  recommendations, or indeed our analysis of the problems. And the raft of 
  measures was completely counter to reducing alienation and extremism. In 
  fact, if anything, it was going to increase alienation in terms of the 
  Muslim community.
</p>
<p>
  Her criticism was echoed by Haras Rafiq, co-founder of Bridges TV (UK), a 
  Muslim television organisation which will start broadcasting later this 
  year. He told us: "The brief was to find ways or find a solution to the 
  problem of extremism and radicalisation within the Muslim community. Now 
  let's just reflect on that. Find a solution for extremism and radicalisation 
  in the Muslim community in the UK, that's a huge piece of work. It isn't 
  something that can be tackled, you know, in the space of a month, two 
  months. The whole process smacked to me a little bit of presentationalism 
  and to be seen to be doing something rather than actually producing an 
  effective and constructive piece of work."
</p>
<p>
  It is hard to regard these task forces as a great deal more than some 
  shallow spin from the Government. In the three years before the London 
  bombings, the Government had commissioned two major enquiries into the 
  problems of Muslim segregation and extremism - Ted Cantle's report in the 
  wake of the Bradford riots and a government report of 2004, Young Muslims 
  and Extremism - and largely dismissed both. The idea that Tony Blair's h
  urriedly formed and short-lived Muslim working groups could provide a better 
  analysis than either of these two earlier studies was absurd.
</p>
<p>
   <b>CONCLUSION</b>

</p>
<p>
  The Government has persistently failed to tell the truth either to itself or 
  to the British public about the terror threat in Britain. These failures of 
  diagnosis have led to failures of response. An example is the Prime 
  Minister's denial that there is a connection between the Iraq war and 
  domestic terrorism. That denial is not merely false. It also inhibits the 
  kind of deep understanding of the motives of Muslim terrorists which the 
  Prime Minister presumably wants.
</p>
<p>
  The defeat in the House of Commons of the Government's proposals for 90 days 
  detention without trial for terrorist suspects was represented at the time 
  as an indication of Tony Blair's political weakness. This analysis missed 
  the point. That Commons defeat signalled a national crisis in public trust 
  in politicians, the police and the security services. Consider this: the 
  Prime Minister of the day, fully backed by the police, had thrown his weight 
  behind a measure he described as crucial for national security and the fight 
  against terrorism. And yet it was comfortably rejected by MPs.
</p>
<p>
  This collapse in trust has come about because few people now believe what 
  the Prime Minister, the security services and the police tell us about 
  security matters. This dissonance is a massive problem. Britain today faces 
  a threat from international and domestic terrorism which is far more 
  dangerous and insidious than anything it has confronted before. We need to 
  trust our politicians, our police, and the media. But that trust has been 
  betrayed.
