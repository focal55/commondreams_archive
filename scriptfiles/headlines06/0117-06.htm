<font size="3">A suicide bomber yesterday rode into town, killing at least 20 in the deadliest insurgent attack since the US invasion. More than 1,600 were killed in 2005, and the murder rate is rising. The rule of law has collapsed. The government is trapped in its own fortified compound in the capital. Soon, Britain will commit another 3,500 troops to a dangerous mission with no clear goals or exit strategy...<br>

  At least 20 people died in a suicide attack in Afghanistan when a 
  motorcyclist detonated his explosives-packed vest. In a separate strike, 
  five Afghan soldiers were killed when a 15-year-old suicide bomber threw 
  himself in front of their convoy. On Sunday, a Canadian diplomat was among 
  three victims of a similar blast.
</p>


        
          
          
            <p>
  It was the bloodiest 48 hours in what is turning into the most violent month 
  in Afghanistan since the country was "liberated" during the US-led 
  invasion in October 2001. And it is into this increasingly savage insurgency 
  that up to 3,500 more British troops will be sent from March.
</p>
<p>

  The most lethal attack was on the town of Spin Boldak near the border with 
  Pakistan, the birthplace of the Taliban. The relentless rise in violence has 
  been described as the "re-Talibanisation" of Afghanistan. 
</p>
<p>
  The new Taliban are deploying tactics that have torn Iraq to shreds, and 
  Afghanistan is seeing a surge in the previously unknown practice of suicide 
  bombings &shy; 25 in four months. This is seen as the reintroduction of 
  al-Qa'ida into Afghanistan &shy; a devastating example of how over-extending the 
"war on terror" into Iraq is rebounding on the West with vengeance. 
  Tony Blair declared after the overthrow of the Taliban and the retreat of 
  Osama bin Laden and al-Qa'ida that "this time we will not walk away"
, a reference to how Afghanistan was allowed to sink into its cycle of 
  destruction after the West had used and then abandoned the country in the 
  Cold War against the Soviets.
</p>
<p>
  President George Bush, supported by Mr Blair, the critics say, has 
  subsequently neglected Afghanistan, toppled Saddam, and spawned "
  al-Qa'ida in Iraq" led by the Jordanian-born militant Abu Musab 
  al-Zarqawi. This is the reality on the ground awaiting thousands of British 
  troops being sent in the next few months into Afghanistan &shy; a redeployment 
  which in itself is part of the disengagement plan for Iraq.
</p>

<p>
  The British force will be supported by planned contributions from the 
  Netherlands of 1,400 to add to forces already there from the US, Canada, 
  Germany, Italy and Spain. The bulk of the American combat troops are going 
  to withdraw to be replaced by British forces in the province of Helmand and 
  the most dangerous of the frontier areas. 
</p>
<p>
  There is, however, rising apprehension that Britain will be forced to take 
  up the vast bulk of the fighting burden. The Nato "commitment" is, 
  however, a matter of intense debate within member countries. The Dutch 
  deployment has been agreed by the government, but not ratified by 
  parliament. Countries such as Italy have refused to send more troops. 
  Francesc Vandrell, the EU's special representative to Afghanistan, warned 
  that it would be "a heavy blow" to Europe's commitment, and 
  Afghanistan's future, if the Dutch failed to agree their deployment.
</p>
<p>
  Hamid Karzai, Afghanistan's President, said the attacks were designed to "
frighten" off Nato members planning to send extra troops, as well as 
  donor countries who are due to meet in London at the end of the month to 
  draw up a deployment plan.
</p>
<p>
  President Karzai, speaking from his heavily fortified palace at Kandahar, 
  said the attacks showed "desperation". He also warned that the 
  country may once again become a breeding ground for devastating assaults, 
  such as the World Trade Centre attacks in New York, unless steps were taken 
  now to combat resurgent Islamist militancy. 
</p>
<p>

  He said: "We are in a joint struggle against terrorism, for us and for 
  the international community. If you don't defend yourself here, you will 
  have to defend yourself back home, in European capitals and America's 
  capitals." 
</p>
<p>
  Despite elections last year, presented as concrete steps towards stability, 
  President Karzai's Afghan forces, trained by Nato, are no match for 
  al-Qa'ida and its supporting phalanx of former Taliban. The real fight will 
  have to be continued by Western troops. Heroin cultivation has rocketed in 
  the atmosphere of lawlessness, with 90 per cent of the supplies in Europe 
  now coming from the country.
</p>
<p>
  The attack by the teenager was in the southern city of Kandahar, the heart 
  of the Pashtun belt. Khalid Abdullah, who witnessed the attack, said: "
  I saw a boy of about 15 with bulky clothes running towards the soldiers in 
  their trucks, then there was a loud explosion. He had blown himself up. 
  People were screaming, there was blood everywhere."
</p>
<p>
  The attack at Spin Boldak took place during a wrestling contest on the 
  holiday of Eid al-Adha.
