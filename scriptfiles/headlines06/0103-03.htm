<p>BAIJI, Iraq - A U.S. air strike killed several
members of a family in the oil refining town of Baiji in
northern Iraq, Iraqi security forces said on Tuesday.

Iraqi police said U.S. aircraft bombed a house Monday night and that seven people were killed and four injured. The U.S. military had no immediate comment on the alleged airstrike or deaths, but the U.S. Central Command said in a press release that Navy F-14s in the vicinity of Beiji strafed a target and dropped a precision-guided bomb 'against insurgents placing an improvised explosive device.'

The U.S. military, responding to an inquiry, said aircraft
had targeted a house after three men suspected of planting a
roadside bomb were seen entering the building late on Monday.</p>
<p>The military statement made no mention of casualties and
said Iraqi police had handled the scene after the attack.</p>
<p>Local people at the scene of the blast said seven bodies
were recovered from the rubble, including at least two
children.</p>
<p>A police official in the regional capital Tikrit said six
people were killed and three wounded, although an official at
the Joint Coordination Center, which liaises between U.S. and
Iraqi forces in Salahaddin province, said 14 died.</p>
<p>Officials named the householder as Ghadhban Nahi Hussein.</p>
<p>A statement from the U.S. 101st Airborne Division in
response to an inquiry about the deaths said soldiers
monitoring video footage from a reconnaissance drone spotted
three men apparently digging a hole around 9 p.m. (1800 GMT)
"following the common pattern of roadside bomb emplacement."</p>
<p>Bomber pilots were alerted, the military statement said:
"The individuals left the road site and were followed from the
air to a nearby building. Coalition forces employed precision
guided munitions on the structure."</p>
<p>The statement did not say whether a roadside bomb was
found.</p>

<p>Baiji has seen considerable rebel attacks, including
efforts by insurgents to disrupt oil and fuel flows through its
refinery, the biggest in Iraq. The closure of the refinery last
month has caused serious shortages in fuel across the country,
although the plant reopened again late on Monday.</p>
<p>U.S. forces have used air power increasingly throughout the
past year. Official military data show only one strike was
carried out in March and the average in the first quarter was
five strikes per month compared to over 50 in the last quarter.</p>
<p>Iraqi medical staff, police and political leaders,
particularly in the restive, Sunni Arab-dominated west and
north, have reported civilian casualties in such raids; U.S.
commanders say they make every effort to minimize that risk.</p>
