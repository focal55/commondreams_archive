PHILADELPHIA - Police arrested ten elderly members of the anti-war group called the Granny Peace Brigade who refused to leave a military recruiting center Wednesday after they were told they were too old to enlist.

Several dozen protesters, some using wheelchairs, canes or walkers and many sporting flower-festooned hats, held signs and chanted outside the downtown Armed Forces Recruiting Center. Some drivers waved and honked their horns in support, and the grandmothers replied by cheering and clapping.</p>

		<p>A few of the women went inside the recruiting facility to speak with military recruiters and to try to dissuade those who arrived to enlist.</p>
		<p>"We're saying, 'I've lived my life. Let me go to Iraq instead of our grandchildren, so they have a chance to live their lives,'" said Jean Haskell, 74, a grandmother of five from Philadelphia.</p>
		<p>The grandmothers were joined in front of the recruiting center by members of other anti-war organizations, whose members chanted, "We insist. Let the grannies enlist."</p>
		<p>The center closed several hours early because of the demonstration, but some protesters remained inside. They were arrested about three hours later.</p>
		<p>It was not immediately clear whether the women had attorneys, or what specific charges they faced.</p>
		<p>In April, 18 Granny Peace Brigade protesters in New York were acquitted of disorderly conduct charges stemming from a demonstration outside a Times Square recruiting center.</p>
