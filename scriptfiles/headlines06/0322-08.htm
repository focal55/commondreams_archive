<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><P>A group of California voters is challenging Secretary of State Bruce 
McPherson's approval of a controversial touch-screen voting system the group 
claims is vulnerable to hackers looking to change election results. 
<P>The suit, put together by the voting rights group <a href="http://www.voteraction.org">Voter Action</a>, asks a San 
Francisco Superior Court to nullify February's conditional certification of 
Diebold Election System's AccuVote-TSx electronic voting system and ban the 
purchase or use of the system for the November statewide election. 
<P>"We can't have trustworthy elections with Diebold's voting machines,'' 
said Lowell Finley, co-director of Voter Action who is an attorney in the case. 
"They are insecure and easily hacked." 
<P>The suit also names the 18 California counties, including Alameda and 
Marin, that used any Diebold system in the last election. 
<P>A spokeswoman for the secretary of state said the Diebold machines pose no 
risk. "The Diebold system has passed the most stringent requirements in the 
nation,'' Jennifer Kerns said. "We're confident that it can ensure the 
integrity of the vote on election day.'' 
<P>A study earlier this year by computer experts hired by the state found a 
number of security problems in the Diebold software. They saw the same problems 
that Finnish computer expert Harri Hursti demonstrated in Florida last year 
when he showed it was possible to use the computer memory cards to undetectably 
change the result of an election, even without passwords or special access to 
the system. 

<P>"Clearly there are serious security flaws,'' the report said. "However, 
despite these serious vulnerabilities, we believe that the security issues are 
manageable.'' 
<P>McPherson's certification sets tough computer security requirements for 
counties using the Diebold machines, but the suit argues that the standards 
aren't enough to guarantee the machines are safe from tampering. 
<P>"The system has been shown to have serious fundamental vulnerabilities to 
fraud and vote manipulation,'' said John Eichhorst, another attorney in the 
case. 
<P>A spokesman for Diebold said the complaints are unfounded. "The system has 
been used over hundreds of elections and performed extremely well,'' said David 
Bear, a spokesman for the company, of Allen, Texas. "It's been consistently 
found to not only be safe and secure, but also accurate.'' 
<P>Many of California's 52 counties are in the market for new voting 
machines, due largely to the 2002 Help America Vote Act, which was passed in 
the wake of the controversy over the hanging chads in the Florida vote recount 
during the 2000 presidential election. Even counties using paper ballots are 
looking at electronic touch-screen models to meet the requirement that every 
polling place have at least one machine that is accessible to people with 
disabilities. 
<P>Although the suit would have no direct effect on the June 6 primary 
election, it casts an enormous shadow over preparations for that vote. Counties 
buying the Diebold system for June would face the possibility of having to 
purchase completely new voting machines for November. 
<P>"This is putting (the counties) in a difficult situation,'' Finley 
admitted, "but the blame should go to the secretary of state, not the 
plaintiffs.'' 
<P>That's not much help for counties struggling over a decision that could 
cost them millions of dollars. 
<P>Marin County, for example, has used Diebold's optical scan system for a 
number of years with no problems, but has not decided whether to buy the 
company's touch-screen machines to accommodate disabled voters. 
<P>"I don't see us being compliant (with the disabled access rules) by June 
6,'' said Michael Smith, the county registrar. "We still have to come up with a 
solution by November.''
