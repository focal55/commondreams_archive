    Forced "to act and dress like mini-adults", children are becoming increasingly depressed and experiencing growing levels of behavioral and developmental problems, they said.</p><p>"Since children's brains are still developing, they cannot adjust as full-grown adults can, to the effects of ever more rapid technological and cultural change," the letter said.</p><p>"They need what developing human beings have always needed, including real food (as opposed to processed "junk"), real play (as opposed to sedentary, screen-based entertainment), first hand experience of the world they live in and regular interaction with the real-life significant adults in their lives."</p><p>The letter was circulated by Sue Palmer, an ex-head teacher and author of a book entitled "Toxic Childhood", and Dr Richard House, a senior lecturer at the Research Center for Therapeutic Education at Roehampton University in London.</p><p>"Children's development is being drastically affected by the kind of world they are brought up in," Palmer told the Daily Telegraph. "It is shocking."</p><p>"A child's physical and psychological growth cannot be accelerated. It changes in biological time, not at electrical speed. Childhood is not a race."</p><p>The experts condemned Britain's increasingly "target-driven" education system and urged the government to recognize children's need for more time and space to develop, demanding an urgent public debate on child-rearing in the 21st century.</p><p>Award-winning children's author Michael Morpurgo, who also signed the letter, said there was a "drip, drip, drip effect" of academic pressure and marketing which was killing childhood.</p><p>"It's gradually soaking like a poison into the culture," he told BBC radio. "There is less room for reading, for dreaming, for music, for drama, for art, and simply for playing."</p>
