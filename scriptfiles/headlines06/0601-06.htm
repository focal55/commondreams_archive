<p>OLYMPIA, Washington - A ship carrying military gear bound for Iraq pulled away from this Puget Sound port Wednesday evening after a week of protests in which more than three dozen people were arrested.
<p>At least 100 protesters chanted "Stop that boat!" as the 950-foot cargo ship pulled away from a dock at the Port of Olympia.</p>

Anti-war protesters attach a banner that reads 'against all terrorism' to the fence at the Port of Olympia Wednesday, May 31, 2006, in Olympia, Wash., where about 100 people were demonstrating against a 950-foot military cargo ship, seen in the background, bound for Iraq. The mood was lighter than previous nights where more than 20 were arrested and pepper spray was used. The USNS Pomeroy left the port later in the evening. (AP Photo/John Froschauer)<br>

The demonstrators also staged a brief "die-in" on the ground to illustrate their opposition to the war in Iraq. There were no immediate arrests, as protesters confined themselves to yelling at law enforcement personnel on hand.</p>
<p>No protest boats were evident on the water, but armed Coast Guard vessels were standing by to intercept any boats that wandered into the area.</p>
<p>Twenty-two people were arrested Tuesday, when police pepper-sprayed several protesters who pulled down a port fence.</p>
<p>Activists began protesting at the port more than a week ago after learning that Stryker vehicles and other Army gear from the 3rd Brigade, 2nd Infantry Division, a 4,000-soldier unit stationed at Fort Lewis, were being shipped to Iraq.</p>
<p>The USNS Pomeroy, the largest ship ever to dock in Olympia, arrived Monday night.</p>

<p>Olympia City Councilman TJ Johnson said Wednesday he was shoved by state troopers trying to clear the area the night before. He said that people were dispersing, but that pepper spray was shot off, anyway.</p>
<p>He said county sheriff's deputies "chose to escalate the situation."</p>
<p>Authorities used pepper spray several times, including once when some in the crowd started hurling bottles and rocks at the approximately 70 law enforcement officers on scene, Kimball said.</p>
<p>"The actions that we took were very limited in force," said Dan Kimball, Thurston County sheriff's chief criminal deputy. "If they didn't start throwing things, we would have stood there until they went home."</p>
<p>Those arrested were released Tuesday night, but will have to go to court and likely will face fines, Kimball said.</p>
<p>Several Olympia officers watched over the small group Wednesday afternoon, where handmade signs reading "U.S. out of Iraq," "Stop the Killing" and "No War" were stacked around a plaza just outside the port, in view of the ship.</p>
<p>"The majority of Americans know the war is wrong," protester Drew Hendricks said. "They're waiting for someone to act, and we're acting."</p>
<p>Later Wednesday, port officials cleared the signs out of the plaza and pressure-washed chalk messages that were written by protesters, who moved outside of yellow tape that was set up outside the plaza.</p>
<p>No one was arrested Monday night, but police in riot gear fired pepper spray as about 150 war protesters tried to enter a port area.</p>

<p>Sixteen people were arrested in three days last week, mostly for pedestrian interference, during protests against convoys through the downtown area to the port from Fort Lewis.</p>
