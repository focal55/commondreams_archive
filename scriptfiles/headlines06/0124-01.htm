<p>   GENEVA  - Swiss civil society activists are staging demonstrations throughout the country to voice their opposition to the World Economic Forum and its upcoming annual meeting of the world's business, economic and political elite in the Swiss ski resort of Davos.<br>
<b><br>
</b>A number of events were organised over the weekend, including a major 
demonstration in the northwestern Swiss town of Reconvilier, where hundreds 
of trade unionists marched to protest Swissmetal's decision to shut down its 
plant there, a major local industry.

<br>
<br>
The march headed up by workers and their families reflects the growing 
resistance to "the arrogance and influence of economic power," said the 
heads of the organisations that participated in the protest.
<br><br>
Throughout the coming week, other demonstrations in opposition to the Davos 
meet will be held in Berne, the Swiss capital, as well as numerous other 
cities, including Basel, St. Gallen, Lucerne, Chur, Thun and Lugano.
<br><br>
This year's World Economic Forum (WEF) meeting in Davos is taking place Jan. 
25-29.
<br><br>
What is most significant about this week's demonstrations is that for the 
first time in the 34-year history of the WEF meet, protests are being held 
outside of Davos itself, located in the canton of Grison in southeastern 
Switzerland.
<br><br>
Daniele Jenni of the Swiss Green Party told IPS that the participating 
groups found themselves forced to give up the practice of protesting at the 
actual meeting venue because "during the WEF, basic rights are not 
recognised in Davos, and much less the right to demonstrate."
<br><br>
Davos and the entire canton of Grison are "under police occupation during 
this entire period," remarked Jenni, who is coordinating the demonstrations 
being staged by civil society groups throughout Switzerland from her 
headquarters in Berne.
<br><br>
In order to hold a protest in Davos during the WEF meet, the participants 
would have to submit to police searches before entering the area and then be 
registered on a list of "extremists" compiled by the Swiss federal police, 
she explained.
<br><br>
These conditions are "unacceptable," she stressed, because it is impossible 
to fully exercise one's basic rights, such as the right to dissent and to 
demonstrate, after being subjected to these "humiliating procedures."
<br><br>

Opponents of the annual WEF gathering view it as "a private forum where an 
elite comprised of powerful men (and very few women) meet to dictate 
political priorities and discuss big business deals," commented Iris Widmer 
of the Swiss affiliate of ATTAC (Association for the Taxation of Financial 
Transactions for the Aid of Citizens).
<br><br>
Widmer said that the consequences of these policies can be seen on a daily 
basis, in the war against Iraq, the poverty and hunger in numerous countries 
of the developing South, the destruction of social security safety nets in 
the countries of the industrialised North, massive unemployment, 
environmental destruction, and the unprecedented profits made by 
transnational corporations.
<br><br>
Jenni maintained that the Davos forum is used by the "rich and powerful of 
the world" to impose their own interests, "the interests of profits and 
power, to the detriment of the majority of the world's population, 
particularly in the Third World."
<br><br>
The protests that begin over the weekend in Switzerland are aimed at 
demonstrating that "there is resistance to this, that the emphasis on 
profits cannot be accepted as something natural," said Jenni.
<br><br>
For the seventh consecutive year, ATTAC Switzerland is hosting a conference 
known as The Other Davos, to discuss proposals from alternative grassroots 
organisations and encourage social mobilisation against the WEF, Widmer told 
IPS.
<br><br>
ATTAC was founded in France in 1998 as an "international movement for 
democratic control of financial markets and their institutions," and has 
affiliates in dozens of countries around the world.
<br><br>
The Other Davos will take place this Friday, Jan. 27, in Zurich. Keynote 
speakers will include Nahla Chahal, a France-based sociology professor and 
coordinator of civilian missions to Palestine; Tania Quiroz Mendieta, a 
Bolivian activist involved in the fight against the privatisation of water; 
and Jay Arena, a U.S. community and peace activist who will talk about the 
difficulties faced by the poor, working-class residents of New Orleans after 
Hurricane Katrina.
<br><br>
The conference participants will discuss the "war on poverty" declared by 
those responsible for "neoliberal policies and imperialist wars," said 
Widmer, referring to the campaign launched by the G8 - the group of the 
world's eight most powerful countries - at its summit in Gleneagles, 
Scotland in July 2005.
<br><br>
In particular, they will analyse whether this "war on poverty" announced by 
the G8 is not in fact merely "a new form of imperialist domination by the 
North over the countries of the South."

<br><br>
But while the rich and powerful of the world continue to meet at forums like 
those held by the G8 and in Davos, there is growing worldwide resistance to 
the ideology of privatisation and the all-powerfulness of the market, added 
Jenni.
<br><br>
This has become especially evident in Latin America, in countries like 
Venezuela and now Bolivia, which will no longer accept this ideology imposed 
throughout the 1980s and 1990s, she remarked.
