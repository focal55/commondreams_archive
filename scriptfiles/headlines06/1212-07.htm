Democrats jazzed by the hype that political stars Sens.
Barack Obama and Hillary Rodham Clinton might run for
president will have to settle for Rep. Dennis Kucinich, at
least for now. 
<P> Five weeks after being elected to a sixth term in the U.S.
House, the former Cleveland mayor will announce today that
he is running for president, his second bid in 2&frac12; years. </P>

 While the presidential spotlight has focused on Obama,
Clinton and other better-known potential candidates,
Kucinich is only the second Democrat to officially launch
his campaign. Outgoing Iowa Gov. Tom Vilsack announced his
campaign for president earlier this month. </P>
<P> Best known locally as a populist politician who presided
over the city when it slid into default in the late 1970s,
Kucinich has earned a national reputation as an anti-war
activist, in part thanks to his pro posal to create a Cabi
net-level department of peace. </P>

<P> Kucinich, 60, ran for president in 2004 largely on his
opposi tion to the war in Iraq. But he won fewer than 70
delegates of the 2,162 needed to win the party's
nomination. And despite early signs he had little support -
he garnered just 1 percent in the 2004 Iowa caucus vote - he
was the last candidate to concede to John Kerry. </P>
<P> Kucinich appears emboldened by the country's flagging
support for the war, so much so that he attacked his
Democratic colleagues Monday for their support of the war. </P>
<P> "Democrats were swept into power on Nov. 7 because of
widespread voter discontent with the war in Iraq,"
Kucinich said in a written statement announcing today's
campaign kickoff. </P>
<P> "Instead of heeding those concerns and responding
with a strong and immediate change in policies and
direction, the Democratic congressional leadership seems
inclined to continue funding the perpetuation of the
war." </P>
<P> Stephen Hess, a George Washington University public
affairs professor who has written several books on the
presidency, said Kucinich's second bid will give his
ideas wider exposure but will do little to improve his
chances of winning. </P>
<P> Hess says Kucinich lacks the charisma of Obama, the
political connections of Clinton or the r&eacute;sum&eacute; of other
candidates considering a run. </P>

<P> "What he has got is a name that's hard to
pronounce and an ideology that's pretty far to the
margins of his party," Hess said. </P>
<P> Washington, D.C., political handicapper Stuart Rothenberg
agrees, adding that Kucinich won't be able to raise as
much money as other contenders and that "he has painted
himself into representing a tiny corner of the Democratic
Party." </P>
<P> "After a while, Congressman Kucinich's Don
Quixote-like struggle starts to appear kind of goofy,"
Rothenberg said. </P>
<P> "Everyone deserves a shot to run for president, but I
am not sure everyone deserves two shots," he said. </P>
<P> In an interview with Plain Dealer editors and reporters a
month before the election, Kucinich said he had "no
plans" for a second bid, though he refused to rule it
out completely. </P>
<P> Republican Mike Dovilla, who was crushed by Kucinich in
the Nov. 7 election, complained bitterly Monday that
Kucinich misled voters. </P>

<P> "It's too bad that during this year's
congressional campaign, Dennis Kucinich did not have the
decency to be honest with the people of Ohio's 10th
District," he said in a statement. "For two more
years, we will have an absentee congressman as Dennis runs
around the nation to indulge his insatiable ego and advance
his personal, extremist agenda in another futile run for the
White House." </P>
