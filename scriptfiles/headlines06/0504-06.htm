<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --> <p>A former Middle East specialist of the US Central Intelligence Agency has condemned what he called an organised campaign of manipulation by the Bush administration to justify the Iraq war.</p>
<p>


Paul Pillar, a former CIA analyst specialising in counter-terrorism in the Middle East and Asia, said in an interview with the Spanish newspaper El Pais that the United States had particularly wanted to prove a link between Al-Qaeda and Saddam Hussein.</p>
<p>

&quot;That was not the case,&quot; he was quoted as saying. &quot;I suppose by some definitions that could be called a lie.&quot;</p>
<p>

&quot;There was an organised campaign of manipulation,&quot; El Pais also quoted Pillar as saying. &quot;That would be the proper way to define it.&quot;</p>

<p>

The decision to invade Iraq was taken as early as the beginning of 2002, a year before hostilities began, Pillar said.</p>
<p>

It was decided &quot;for other reasons and did not depend on weapons of mass destruction or the results of United Nations inspections,&quot; he said, according to the interview published in Spanish.</p>
<p>

&quot;As far as weapons of mass destruction were concerned, there was a generally false perception in the American, British and other intelligence services that Iraq possessed these. We were wrong.&quot;</p>
<p>
&quot;The problem was the wider message, the attempt to spread the impression that there was a terrorist alliance between Iraq and Al-Qaeda,&quot; Pillar was also quoted as saying.</p>

<p>

The theory of the link interested the government of President George W. Bush because &quot;it was this that most strongly affected public opinion in the United States, and which would keep alive the images of September 11, 2001.</p>
<p>
&quot;The administration's voracious appetite to obtain material about this non-existent alliance cost a great deal of time and work to senior intelligence staff and the most highly experienced analysts in the CIA,&quot; Pillar said in the interview.</p>
