<p>


Researchers recently found the Pentagon's directive 1332.38, on &quot;physical disability evaluation,&quot; which includes homosexuality in a list of &quot;mental disorders,&quot; along with mental retardation and personality disorders.</p>
<p>

The November 1996 document was re-certified as &quot;current&quot; in 2003, according to the Center for the Study of Sexual Minorities in the Military at the University of California, Santa Barbara.</p>

        <!--/endimage/--> &quot;It is disappointing that certain Department of Defense instructions include homosexuality as a 'mental disorder' more than 30 years after the mental health community recognized that such a classification was a mistake,&quot; Representative Marty Meehan  of Massachusetts said Tuesday.</p>
<p>

&quot;There is no scientific basis for such a classification, which leads me to believe that the classification is motivated by something more sinister,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>

Meehan and eight other members of Congress sent a letter to Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld on Monday calling for changes.</p>
<p>




They said &quot;any inadvertent outdated language&quot; should be updated so that military regulations are consistent &quot;and in keeping with the American Psychiatric Association's stance reaffirming that 'homosexuality per se implies no impairment in judgment, stability, reliability or general social and vocational capabilities.'&quot;</p>
<p>


Lieutenant Colonel Jeremy Martin, a Pentagon spokesman, told AFP the document is &quot;currently under review.&quot;</p>
<p>

The lawmakers also called for a general review of the US military's policies and medical regulations. They estimated that there are about 65,000 homosexual and bisexual members of the US armed forces.</p>
<p>

Since 1993, he said the US military has had a &quot;don't ask, don't tell&quot; policy under which gays and lesbians are tolerated as long as they do not make their sexual orientation public. Openly homosexual soldiers are forced to leave the service.</p>
<p>

According to a Congress watchdog report released last year, the US Army has spent 200 million dollars in 10 years to replace the estimated 10,000 homosexual soldiers forced to leave the military.</p>
