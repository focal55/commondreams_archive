<P> KENNEBUNKPORT, Maine - The din of helicopters cutting the otherwise calm sea air here can mean only one thing the president's coming.
</P>

<P>

It has been two years since George W. Bush visited his parents' home at scenic Walker's Point. The last time, it was for the wedding of George Prescott Bush, the president's nephew. This time, he's coming for four days to celebrate the wedding of his second cousin, 29-year-old Walker Stapleton, to Jennifer Bertocchi.</P>

Stapleton is the son of former President George H.W. Bush's cousin Dorothy Walker Stapleton and Craig Roberts Stapleton, the current U.S. ambassador to France.</P>

<P>

The wedding is scheduled to be held outside St. Ann's Episcopal Church on Ocean Avenue at 4 p.m. Saturday, and more than 300 guests are expected to attend, according to the Rev. Peter Cheney no relation to the vice president.
</P>
<P>

One might assume that an A-list wedding would add to anticipation of the commander in chief's arrival in town. But it was business as usual in downtown Kennebunkport on Wednesday.</P>

<P>

"The locals pretty much have this down to a science," said Kennebunkport Police Chief Joe Bruni, who has handled security for visits by the former and current President Bush since the 1980s.</P>

<P>

In the past, the president's jaunts in and out of Kennebunkport have been fairly private, marked more by golf than geopolitics.</P>

<P>

But if the president hopes to leave politics behind during this brief visit, he'll have to ignore protesters who plan to converge in Kennebunkport to remind him, they say, that many Americans disagree with some administration policies, particularly the war in Iraq.</P>

<P>

Jamilla El-Shafei of Kennebunk said she and other organizers have spread the word on the Internet in the last few days.</P>

<P>

As many as 600 people from peace groups across New England are expected to march through town in a rally on Saturday, El-Shafei said. "I don't think we'll ever have seen a protest this big in Kennebunkport."</P>

<P>

Protesters, including some in togas playing fiddles, plan to assemble at the Consolidated School in Kennebunkport Saturday morning and march from there through Dock Square, then out along Ocean Avenue toward Walker's Point until they are stopped by security. </P>

<P>

Most in downtown Kennebunkport appeared unimpressed by the occasion, simply complaining of the added aggravation of negotiating traffic around motorcades and demonstrations.</P>

<P>

Security will be high for the duration of Bush's stay, and was already in evidence on Wednesday as helicopters flew over the coast.</P>

<P>

Roads leading to and from Walker's Point will be blocked off near the former president's home.</P>

<P>

According to Sanford Regional Airport Director Evan McDougal, there will be a 10-mile no-fly zone around the president, with limited air activity allowed between 10 and 30 miles.</P>

<P>

The airport has canceled all flight instruction for the weekend.</P>

<P>

Despite the restrictions and the complaints of locals, many will get wrapped up in the thrill of the moment. </P>

<P>

"We usually get 40 to 50 people right along the fence," said Will Sheldrake, senior flight lineman for Sanford Air Inc., the operator of Sanford Regional Airport, where Air Force One lands when the president visits Maine.</P>

<P>

"A lot of people make comments about the crowding and traffic," said George Yankowski, owner of Maine Stay Inn &amp; Cottages on Route 9. But, he said, even many of those who pretend to be unfazed by a presidential visit will line the motorcade route.</P>

<P>

"Whenever he comes, he drives by here and all our guests, they go out and wave," he said.</P>

<P>

A wave, according to Maj. Bill Littlefield of the Sanford police, will likely be all they'll get in return.</P>

<P>

"The former President Bush, he'd stop and chat with you for 15 or 20 minutes, but this president's transitions from point A to point B are very quick and businesslike," he said. "It's a different world."</P>
