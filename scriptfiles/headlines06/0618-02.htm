<p> FORT ERIE, Ontario - Army deserters living in Canada and Americans  against the Iraq War came together  Saturday along the Niagara River,  just a few hundred yards from U.S.  soil but miles away from the ideology  of some American political leaders. 
<P>     The event  was a show of  solidarity between peace activists in the two  countries and a  call for the Canadian government to welcome the  estimated 200 U.S. soldiers who have  fled north of the border, citing conscientious objections to the Iraq War.    "It's absolutely the first time this  has ever happened - that an event  has taken place like this across the  border from a U.S. city - so it's historic in that sense," said organizer  Bruce Beyer, a war resister from the  Vietnam era. Beyer lived for three  years in Sweden, five years in Canada  and served a 30-day jail sentence in  the United States for deserting before  returning to Buffalo. <P>     Veterans of the Iraq, Gulf and Vietnam wars who gathered for day two  of "Peace Has No Borders" said they  were proud, patriotic Americans who  dutifully served their country until  witnessing first-hand the atrocities of  what they called an "illegal and unjust" war. <P>     "I made the absolute, 100 percent  wrong decision," said Geoff Millard, leader of  the local chapter of Iraq Veterans Against the  War. "I came back from Iraq on Oct. 27, 2005.  And on Oct. 29, 2005 I started to make the  right decision when I gave my first anti-war  speech." <P>    Peace Has No Borders started Friday with  a War Resisters Support Campaign in Kleinhans Music Hall.<B> </B>Before moving on to the  Peace Bridge Saturday, the 200 anti-war protesters began the day with a picnic, in SugarBowl Park. During a gathering titled "A Festival of Resistance," they sporadically chanted  and sought refuge under trees from an oppressive sun. Seven war resisters who spoke to the  crowd are seeking asylum in Canada.    It's a moral and legal obligation for soldiers  to lay down their arms and speak out when  they feel compelled to, even if they're branded  cowards and have to flee, said Patrick Hart, a  Buffalo-native who now lives in Toronto with  his wife. <P>     "War changes you and it changed me. And  I'm just trying to get back to being the person I  was before I went in the Army," he said. <P>     Saturday's event came at a time when the  death toll for U.S. troops reached 2,500 last  week but as President Bush and Iraq War supporters are buoyed by the death of terrorist  Abu Musab al-Zarqawi. As a result, public  opinion on the war and America's next course  of action is mixed. <P>     The picnic was peppered with national and  international media, enticed by the scheduled  appearance of Cindy Sheehan, an outspoken  critic of President Bush and his policies. <P>     Sheehan, whose son died in Iraq in April  2004, wrapped up her first visit to Buffalo by  crossing the border and flanking herself with  the AWOL soldiers who can't return to their  home country without facing court martials. <P>     "I can feel the energy of the movement,"  Sheehan told The Buffalo News after her  speech. "It's really going to take people who  have been there, people who have had losses  like mine and people who don't want to go  there to bring attention to the movement." <P>     George Homanich of Binghamton attended the picnic, as well as Friday night's benefit  in Kleinhans with his daughter Sarah, a Buffalo State College student. 
<P>     "Learning more about their struggle and  seeing the amazing amount of support they do  have on both sides of the border was very uplifting," he said.
