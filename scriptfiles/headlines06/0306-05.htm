<p>TONY Blair believes that God will judge him over his decision to invade Iraq.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister told ITV chat-show host Michael Parkinson: "If you have faith about these things, then you realise that judgment is made by other people. If you believe in God, it's made by God as well."</p>
<p>The controversial remark outraged families of servicemen who have died in Iraq and sparked debate over whether the PM overstepped the mark by mixing politics and religion.</p>
<p>Here, our panel - some who have lost loved ones in Iraq - give their views on the PM's comments...</p>
<p>ROSE GENTLE</p>
<p>CAMPAIGNER for Military Families Against The War, whose son Gordon was killed in Basra in 2004, aged 19.</p>
<p>'I HOPE my boy isn't with the same God Tony Blair prays to.</p>
<p>What kind of God would justify the deaths of thousands of people? If there is a God, He'll judge Mr Blair to have made the wrong decision - one for which I and many other British families have already been punished.</p>
<p>I know my son would also think that Mr Blair was totally out of order. Thanks to him, I'll never see Gordon grow up. He's constantly in my mind and the grief is sometimes too much.</p>
<p>That's why I was disgusted by Mr Blair's comments.</p>
<p>Since his interview, I've received lots of texts from boys out in Iraq and they're all laughing at Mr Blair. One said: "Tell Tony Blair to ask God for a date to bring us back."'</p>
<p>COL TIM COLLINS</p>
<p>COMMANDED 1st Battalion Royal Irish Regiment in Iraq.</p>
<p>'As a Christian myself, I believe that, one day, we'll all be called to account by God for our actions.</p>
<p>And if Mr Blair lied about why he was going to war, he'll have a big problem on Judgment Day.</p>
<p>God doesn't start wars - men do. I'm sure God already knew there were no weapons of mass destruction in Iraq when Mr Blair was saying there were.</p>
<p>He wouldn't approve of sending 103 soldiers to their deaths on a pack of lies and He wouldn't have planned a war without providing for the welfare of the Iraqi people.</p>
<p>The fact that there wasn't any such plan - and hundreds of Iraqis are dying every day - suggests to me that God didn't have much to do with it.'</p>
<p>REG KEYS</p>
<p>FATHER of Lance Corp. Tom Keys, killed by a mob in Majar Al-Kabir, in June 2003. Reg stood against Mr Blair in his Sedgfield constituency in the general election.</p>
<p>'FORGET God, I'll judge Mr Blair myself... and I find him guilty on all counts.</p>
<p>He's guilty of not telling the truth, not showing restraint and not acting with integrity.</p>
<p>God and religion has nothing to do with this war.</p>
<p>Saddam wasn't threatening this country and don't tell me that Iraq is a better place.</p>
<p>There are more people dying there daily than at any time before the war. Mr Blair is using God as a get-out for total strategic failure.</p>
<p>My son and too many other young men gave their lives for this country on the basis of the Prime Minister's lies.</p>
<p>I'm not a religious person but I have grave concerns about a PM who deploys troops to war when he believes in a God who says, "Thou shalt not kill."</p>
<p>If Mr Blair does one day face his creator, God help I him.'</p>
<p>REV JOHN MANN</p>
<p>VICAR of St James Church, Glasgow, who conducted the funeral of Fusilier Gordon Gentle in 2004.</p>
<p>'IF it were me involved in an illegal war in which so many thousands of people had been killed, I'd be extremely concerned about how God is going to judge me. The reality is that because of Mr Blair's actions in this world, many people have died. And this should weigh heavily on his conscience.</p>
<p>But as it happens, Mr Blair seems more concerned about his historical legacy.</p>
<p>I just hope that, one day, he'll feel a deep sense of shame for what he has done, that he will seek God's forgiveness before Judgment Day comes. The God I believe in abhors violence - and to connect any religion with war is blasphemy.</p>
<p>To justify killing people in the name of God or faith... well, I find abhorrent.'</p>
<p>TERRY WAITE</p>
<p>EX-hostage and former adviser to the Archbishop of Canterbury.</p>
<p>'IF Tony Blair was claiming that God supported him in going to war, that would be outrageous. But I don't think that is what he meant. He meant that God would be his judge.</p>
<p>I don't want to put myself in God's position but I was dead against the war. I still think it was entirely wrong.</p>
<p>It was a mistaken strategy. It hasn't made the world safer from terrorism, it has involved the death of many people and destroyed our credibility.</p>
<p>Now Iraq stands on the edge of civil war. It has been a disaster and we have no sensible exit strategy. How we get out of, it is beyond me.'</p>
<p>ANDREW MURRAY</p>
<p>CHAIRMAN of the Stop The War coalition.</p>
<p>'SAYING that "I only answer to God," is very convenient for Tony Blair.</p>
<p>It gets him off the hook of having to answer to the parents of the British soldiers who have died in Iraq.</p>
<p>I'm a non-believer but it is a fact that the leaders of every major religion were against the war. The Prime Minister is either being arrogant in claiming he has a hot-line to God, or duplicitous in ignoring the moral views of all religious leaders.</p>
<p>Almost every argument has been pressed into action to justify this war.</p>
<p>First, it was about non-existent weapons of mass destruction. Then it was about protecting us from terrorism, which the war made worse. Then it was about liberating Iraqis, who hate our presence in their country.</p>
<p>Now that every secular argument has collapsed, Mr Blair turns to God. It is deeply distasteful.'</p>
<p>IHTISHAM HIBATULLAH</p>
<p>REPESENTATIVE of the Muslim Association Of Britain.</p>
<p>'WHEN I first heard Mr Blair's interview, I wondered whether it was God or George he meant.</p>
<p>If he really meant God, I sincerely hope God doesn't hold him accountable for the carnage he has caused in Iraq.</p>
<p>In the eyes of Iraqis, and humanity at large, the war is a crime beyond recognition, co-authored by Blair and based on lies.</p>
<p>It has resulted in the deaths of thousands of innocent Iraqis, as well as British and American servicemen, while the country has descended into chaos.</p>
<p>I'm frightened to even think how God might judge Mr Blair for this.</p>
<p>Instead, I hope he prays to God for forgiveness and mercy.'</p>
