<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><P>One of the biggest polling exercises ever conducted has uncovered an overwhelming belief that the Iraq war has increased rather than decreased the chances of terrorist attacks.<P>The survey of 41,856 people in 35 countries, commissioned by the BBC World Service and published today, found about 60% of those polled shared this view. Only 12% thought the war had reduced the chances of an attack, with 15% saying it had no effect either way. In Britain, 77% of those questioned thought the terrorist threat had risen since the 2003 invasion.<P>There was overall support in 20 countries for US-led forces to withdraw from Iraq in the next few months unless there was a specific request by the Iraqi government for them to stay.<P>The removal of Saddam Hussein was branded a mistake by a majority in 21 of the countries. On average, 45% of those questioned agreed that removing him was a mistake, with 36% supporting the action. In Britain, 40% of those polled said it was a mistake, while 49% backed it.<P>Steven Kull, director of the Programme on International Policy Attitudes at the University of Maryland, which helped conduct the survey between last October and January, said: "Though the Bush administration has framed the intervention in Iraq as a means of fighting terrorism, all around the world most people view it as having increased the likelihood of terrorist attacks."<P>The biggest pullout call came in Argentina, where 80% favoured this. Those most in favour of US-led forces staying until Iraq was stable were the US and Afghanistan 58%, Australia 57% and Britain 56%.<P>In Baghdad yesterday, three people were killed and 11 wounded when a motorcycle packed with explosives blew up outside a Sunni mosque. In a separate incident, the Iraqi Islamic party, the largest Sunni political group, said the body of one of its officials, Waad Jassim al-Ani, had been found with signs of torture after being detained by a security agency.
