<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><P>As Israel has steadily escalated its military assault on Hezbollah, so has 
the criticism about the rising number of civilian deaths resulting from its 
campaign.  
<P>Lebanon's Prime Minister Fuad Saniora, accusing Israel of indiscriminately 
targeting civilians, said Wednesday that his country "has been torn to shreds" 
by Israel's aerial bombardment, which he said has killed 300 Lebanese, mostly 
civilians, wounded 1,000 and displaced half a million more.

"Can the international community stand by while such callous retribution 
by the state of Israel is inflicted on us?" Saniora asked. Israeli officials 
have said the intense military campaign is necessary to root out the 
infrastructure of an organization that started the conflict by its unprovoked 
killing of eight Israeli soldiers and the kidnapping of two more last week. 
Israel denies its air strikes deliberately target Lebanese civilians. 
<P>Twenty-nine Israelis are reported to have died in eight days of fighting, 
including 14 soldiers and 15 civilians. The civilians were killed by Hezbollah 
rocket and missile attacks on Israeli cities and towns.  
<P>Capt. Jacob Dallal, the Israeli Defense Forces spokesman, said Israeli 
forces were doing "everything to minimize" civilian casualties in Lebanon. 
Hezbollah fighters "don't care" about the deaths of Lebanese civilians, he 
said. "They just want to wreak havoc in classic terrorist style." 
<P>But could Israel's campaign, however justified, be waged without 
inflicting such a high number of Lebanese civilian casualties? 

<P>Some military analysts say it probably cannot. "Hezbollah is so 
intertwined with the society and community, it's very difficult to try to 
destroy the Hezbollah infrastructure without such collateral damage," said 
Babak Yektafar, an expert on the Middle East at the Center for Defense 
Information in Washington. "If (Israeli forces) were more concerned with 
collateral damage, they wouldn't be as effective in destroying Hezbollah 
infrastructure." 
<P>Analysts agree that some Hezbollah offices and command posts bombed by 
Israel are so close to civilian targets that casualties among noncombatants are 
inevitable. Some Hezbollah offices, for example, share buildings with 
apartments where civilians live, Yektafar said; others cluster in houses in 
crowded residential neighborhoods. Many of the mosques Hezbollah supports are 
community centers where elders meet and where families take their children to 
study the Quran.  
<P>In the densely packed Shiite neighborhoods in Beirut's southern suburbs  
--  Hezbollah's bedrock of support  --  Israeli air strikes in the past week 
have reduced entire blocks to rubble, collapsing facades of multistory 
apartment houses into the streets.  
<P>"Certain neighborhoods are Hezbollah neighborhoods; you can't hit 
Hezbollah without hitting civilians," said Mark Burgess, a terrorism expert at 
the Brussels office of the Washington-based World Security Institute. 
<P>A more debated assertion, put forward by some analysts and Israeli 
officials, say Hezbollah stores arms and ammunition in residential houses and 
often fires rockets at Israel using civilians who live in the houses as human 
shields.  
<P>"The reality is, we're fighting an organization that stores the missiles 
it launches against us in people's homes," Dallal said. "They do it on 
purpose." 
<P>Christopher Hamilton, a counterterrorism expert at the Washington 
Institute for Near East Policy, said Hezbollah had set up special structures 
inside civilian compounds and fired missiles from inside. 
<P>"You have a special structure they build in the house itself so they could 
shoot a rocket without being in the open, camouflaged so that they couldn't be 
seen," Hamilton said. "The people who died in these houses were civilians, but 
they were Hezbollah supporters, since the rockets were there." 
<P>But other experts say Hezbollah has no need to use civilian houses because 
it has an elaborate network of bunkers and missile launchers in deserted areas 
throughout the country.  
<P>"This is not some cynical Saddam Hussein plan of putting missiles in 
hospitals," said Nicholas Noe, the founder of the Beirut-based Mideastwire.com, 
an online bulletin of Arabic and Farsi media. He said Hezbollah has such 
carefully established firing positions in the sparsely populated southern 
Lebanon that it has "no reason strategically ... of putting Katyusha rockets in 
civilian houses." 
<P>Such differences among experts show how little is actually known about how 
Hezbollah operates, said John Pike, director of GlobalSecurity.org, a military 
think-tank in Washington. Hezbollah is small  --  Pike estimates it has about 
500 full-time combatants  --  and maintains a very tight internal security and 
secrecy. 
<P>"That's small relative to an American street gang," Pike said.  
<P>Other analysts note that such limited knowledge also may affect the 
precision with which Israel is waging its campaign  --  resulting in air 
strikes on locations which have nothing to do with Hezbollah. Some air strikes 
have hit minivans and other vehicles, causing multiple casualties.  
<P>"They say they are striking Hezbollah strongholds, but the question you 
have to ask: What kind of intelligence, exactly, Israel has on the ground in 
Lebanon?" said Noe, who researches Hezbollah and has lived in Beirut for the 
past three years. An air strike Wednesday on two well-drilling trucks in the 
upscale Christian Beirut neighborhood of Achrafiyeh suggests that some of 
Israel's intelligence might be faulty. The trucks, with their drills folded, 
resemble rocket launchers. The strike destroyed the trucks but harmed no 
civilians.  
<P>A Chronicle correspondent who briefly toured the neighborhoods after the 
Israeli bombings discovered no shells, gun emplacements, caches of weapon, or 
any other evidence that Hezbollah had been using the bombed buildings for any 
military purpose.  
<P>Such examples point to the dangers of using air power, which is not always 
accurate or precise, especially if based on faulty intelligence or lack of 
intelligence.  
<P>Only if Israel used "real-time intelligence from human assets on the 
ground" to find hiding places could it seriously limit the danger from 
Hezbollah's rockets without a ground offensive, Elias Hanna, a retired Lebanese 
army brigadier general, told the Associated Press.  

<P>The Israelis have hinted broadly at just such a campaign  --  which is 
what Hezbollah wants, according to Fred Burton, a counterterrorism expert at 
Strategic Forecasting, a security consulting agency.  
<P>"You've got an organization that in reality is not going to be able to 
stand toe-to-toe with the Israelis' defense forces, but they are very effective 
at falling back into a guerrilla-type campaign, conducting insurgency 
operations almost like we see today in Iraq," Burton said. 
<P>Should that occur, Lebanese civilian casualties are bound to increase.  
<P>"In general, yes, there is a lot of collateral damage  --  (including) 
people who hate Hezbollah and have nothing to do with the conflict," Hamilton 
said. 
<P>"This happens in conflicts."
<P><b>Developments in the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah </b>
<P>-- 
Israeli troops enter Lebanon: Israeli troops crossed into south Lebanon as 
warplanes flattened houses and buildings and attempted to destroy a bunker 
thought to hold Hezbollah's top leaders. Israel said two soldiers were killed, 
and Hezbollah reported the death of one guerrilla. 
<P>-- Casualties increase: Lebanese Prime Minister Fuad Saniora said 300 
people have been killed, 1,000 have been wounded and a half-million displaced 
in Israel's week-old onslaught. Israel says 14 soldiers and 15 civilians have 
been killed, while 9 soldiers and 344 civilians have been wounded. 
<P>-- Compensation for damage to be sought: Saniora said he would seek 
compensation from Israel for the "unimaginable losses" to Lebanon's 
infrastructure. 
<P>-- Hezbollah rocket kills 2 children: A Hezbollah rocket slammed into a 
building in the mainly Arab town of Nazareth in northern Israel, killing two 
children, Israel said. 
<P>-- More Americans evacuated: A cruise liner carrying more than 1,000 
Americans from Lebanon, the first mass U.S. evacuation since Israeli air 
strikes began last week, arrived in Cyprus.
