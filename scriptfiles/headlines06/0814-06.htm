        The Bush administration was informed in advance and gave the &quot;green 
  light&quot; to Israel's military strikes against Hizbollah &shy; with plans 
  drawn up months before two Israeli soldiers were seized &shy;it has been 
  claimed. 
<p>
  The US reportedly considered Israel's actions as a necessary prerequisite 
  for a possible strike against Iran. A report by a leading investigative 
  reporter says that earlier this summer Israeli officials visited Washington 
  to brief the government on its plan to respond to any Hizbollah provocation 
  and to "find out how much the US would bear". 

</p>
<p>
  The officials apparently started their inquiries with Vice-President Dick 
  Cheney, knowing that if they secured his support, obtaining the backing of 
  President Bush and Condoleezza Rice would be easier.
</p>
<p>
  The report by Seymour Hersh quotes an unidentified US government consultant 
  with close ties to the Israelis who says: "The Israelis told us it 
  would be a cheap war with many benefits. Why oppose it? We'll be able to 
  hunt down and bomb missiles, tunnels, and bunkers from the air. It would be 
  a demo for Iran." 
</p>
<p>
  A former intelligence officer, also quoted, says: "We told 
  Israel,'Look, if you guys have to go, we're behind you all the way. But we 
  think it should be sooner rather than later. The longer you wait, the less 
  time we have to evaluate and plan for Iran before Bush gets out of office'."</p>
<p>
  Both Israeli and US officials say that the Israeli military operation 
  against Hizbollah was triggered by the seizing of two Israeli soldiers, 
  apparently to be bargained with for a possible prisoner swap. But Hersh's 
  report, published in today's issue of The New Yorker, adds to evidence that 
  Israel had been anticipating a Hizbollah provocation for some time and 
  planning its response &shy; a response that was widely condemned for being 
  disproportionate.

</p>
<p>
  Last month the San Francisco Chronicle reported that "Israel's military 
  response by air, land and sea to what it considered a provocation last week 
  by Hizbollah militants was unfolding according to a plan finalised more than 
  a year ago". The report said that a senior Israeli army officer had 
  been briefing diplomats, journalists and think-tanks for more than a year 
  about the plan and it quoted Gerald Steinberg, professor of political 
  science at [Israel's] Bar-Ilan University, who said: "Of all of 
  Israel's wars since 1948, this was the one for which Israel was most 
  prepared." Last week the New Statesman magazine reported that Britain 
  had also been informed in advance of the military preparations and that the 
  Prime Minister had chosen not to try to stop them "because he did not 
  want to".
</p>
<p>
  This latest report is the first to tie the Israeli operation to a broader 
  framework that includes a possible US strike against Iran.
</p>
<p>
  Unidentified officials said a strike could "ease Israel's security 
  concerns and also serve as a prelude to a potential American pre-emptive 
  attack". Shabtai Shavit, a national security adviser to the Knesset, 
  said: "We do what we think is best for us, and if it happens to meet 
  America's requirements, that's just part of a relationship between two 
  friends. Hizbollah is armed to the teeth and trained in the most advanced 
  technology of guerrilla warfare. It was just a matter of time." 
</p>
<p>
  An anonymous Middle East expert claimed that while the State Department 
  supported the plan because it believed it would help the Lebanese government 
  assert control over the south, the White House was focussed on stripping 
  Hizbollah of its missiles. 
</p>

<p>
  The expert added: "If there was to be a military option against Iran's 
  nuclear facilities, it had to get rid of the weapons that Hizbollah could 
  use in a potential retaliation at Israel. Bush was going after Iran, as part 
  of the 'axis of evil', and its nuclear sites, and he was interested in going 
  after Hizbollah as part of his interest in democratisation." 
</p>
<p>
  Last night the White House denied the allegations contained in Hersh's piece 
  with a brief statement from the President describing it as "patently 
  untrue". Mr Bush's national security adviser, Stephen Hadley, added: "
The suggestion that the US and Israel planned and co-ordinated an attack on 
  Hizbollah &shy; and did so as a prelude to an attack on Iran &shy; is just flat 
  wrong."
