            <p>
  The world is bathed in a soup of industrial chemicals which are damaging the 
  intellectual potential of the next generation and may increase the incidence 
  of conditions such as Parkinson's disease, they say.
</p>
<p>
  One in every six children has a developmental disability, such as autism, 
  attention deficit disorder or cerebral palsy, the effects of which may be 
  life-long.
</p>
<p>
  The role of low-level pollutants, such as lead and mercury, on the growing 
  brain has been recognised for decades and measures taken to reduce exposure 
  to a minimum. But scientists from the Harvard School of Public Health, in 
  Boston, say at least 202 chemicals are known to have the capacity to damage 
  the brain and their effects at low levels of exposure are unknown. They say 
  limits for exposure to chemicals should be set for pregnant women and young 
  children, recognising the unique sensitivity of the developing brain, which 
  is much more susceptible to the toxic effects of chemicals.
</p>
<p>
  Philippe Grandjean, visiting professor at Harvard and lead author of the 
  review, published in the online Lancet, said: "The human brain is a 
  precious and vulnerable organ. Even limited damage may have serious 
  consequences. It probably is going to be difficult [to set exposure limits] 
  but this is a classical case where there really is a lot at stake. We are 
  talking about the brain development of future generations. There will be an 
  enormous cost of not regulating exposure."
</p>

<p>
  Critics accused the scientists of scaremongering and said their claim of a 
  silent pandemic was a "gross overstatement".
</p>
<p>
  The 202 chemicals listed by the authors have been shown to cause serious 
  accidents when ingested, or have been used in suicide attempts. They include 
  chemicals used in household products, such as aluminium in saucepans and 
  soft-drink cans, and acetone in nail-polish remover. The main exposure to 
  the pollutants is through contamination of the environment during 
  manufacture, when the chemicals seep into ground water, are carried in air 
  or contaminate food.
</p>
<p>
  Commenting on the review, Professor Nigel Brown, dean of medicine at St 
  George's School of Medicine, University of London, said: "This is a 
  campaigning article. In their enthusiasm, the authors verge on 
  scaremongering.
</p>
<p>
  "[Their claim] of a silent pandemic is a gross overstatement. It is 
  possible that there is a problem, we should be aware of this and we should 
  study it but there is currently not a shred of evidence of a pandemic."

   <b>What chemical pollution can do</b>
</p>
<p>
   <b>Acrylamide</b>
</p>
<p>
  Used in adhesives, printing ink and agricultural sprays. Can cause 
  drowsiness and hallucinations.
</p>
<p>
   <b>Cyclohexane</b>

</p>
<p>
  Used to make nylon, paint and resin removers, and fungicides. Can cause 
  headaches and convulsions.
</p>
<p>
   <b>Acetone</b>
</p>
<p>
  Used in nail-polish remover and to make plastics, fibres and drugs. 
  Breathing it over long periods can cause light-headedness and confusion.
</p>
<p>
   <b>Methanol</b>

</p>
<p>
  Used as a petrol additive and in spray paints. Can cause an effect similar 
  to drunkenness followed by severe stomach, leg and back pain.
</p>
<p>
   <b>Trichloroethylene</b>
</p>
<p>
  Used in dry cleaning. Breathing it for long periods may cause dizziness, 
  poor co-ordination and difficulty concentrating.
</p>
<p>
   <b>Aniline</b>

</p>
<p>
  Used to make pesticides, dyes and rubber. Breathing in small amounts over 
  several years may cause cancer.
</p>
<p>
   <b>Styrene</b>
</p>
<p>
  Used in making plastics. Breathing small amounts over long periods causes 
  alterations in vision, hearing loss and slower reaction times.
