<p> TORONTO - Sgt. Patrick Hart was  eager to get his first look at quarterback  J.P. Losman. <P>     The rabid Bills fan had received a  weekend pass from his unit in Fort  Campbell, Ky., to attend the Aug. 20 preseason game against the Packers. <P>     But Hart was anxious for other reasons, too. <P>     His company was headed to Iraq in  five weeks, and the nine-year Army veteran - whose three enlistments included  nearly a year in Kuwait - opposed the  war. <P>     He left Buffalo, where he grew up in  the Riverside area, the next day. But instead of returning to his base, he drove  across the Peace Bridge to Toronto, met  with a war resisters group and then deserted the Army. <P>     Hart filed for refugee status with the  Canadian government, joining about 20  other American deserters seeking asylum  north of the border. <P>     Ten months later, he expresses no regret about a decision many of his fellow  countrymen would consider an act of  cowardice or treason. The Iraq War, Hart  believes, is being waged over oil and to  line the pockets of multinational corporations while poor and lower-middle-class  recruits serve on the front<I> </I>lines. <P>     "When I enlisted in the Army, part of  my oath was to defend the Constitution  against all enemies - foreign and domestic. I can't go over there and put other  kids in harm's way for lies. I'm not going  to do that," Hart said in a recent interview in the two-bedroom apartment west  of downtown overlooking Lake Ontario,  which he shares with wife, Jill, and 4-year-old son, Rian. <P>  He met Saturday with Cindy Sheehan,  the mother of a slain Army soldier and a  symbolic leader against the war, in a rally  and and picnic in Fort Erie. <P>     Still looking like a soldier, Hart, 32,  has short hair under his Bills cap, and his  heavily tattooed arms include melted  skulls and tribal blackwork designs.    Hart has yet to find work, but the family receives assistance from the War Resisters Support Campaign in Toronto and  family members. <P>     Hart grew up in Riverside, an admittedly "horrible" student. After graduating  from Emerson High School in 1991, he  worked dead-end jobs for a year before  enlisting in 1992. <P>     Hart served as a logistics technician  and was stationed in Germany. Being in  the Army then, he said, gave him a sense  of purpose. <P>     "I was so proud and motivated to be  part of something bigger," Hart said. <P>     His proudest moment was helping the  air drop of medical supplies, food and  clothing to the war-torn former Yugoslavia. <P>     When Hart returned home three  years later, he thought his honorable discharge might help him land a factory job  at Powertrain or Dunlop Tire, but he  found himself once more bouncing from  one low-paying job to another. <P>     Hart married his girlfriend of five  years, Jill, in 2000, and re-enlisted later  that year. The couple spent the next four  years assigned to Fort Riley, Kan., where  Rian was born. <P>     While the statue of Saddam Hussein  was being toppled in Baghdad, Hart and  the rest of the 172nd Chemical Company  were being flown to the Kuwaiti desert. <P>     Even then, Hart says, he didn't understand why the United States was waging  war in Iraq. <P>     "I was fully ready and prepared to go  to Afghanistan," he said of the then-Taliban-led country that shielded Osama bin  Laden. "I didn't see the correlation with  Iraq." <P>     Despite harboring second thoughts,  Hart re-enlisted in January 2004, because his son needed medical coverage  for epileptic seizures. The Harts feared  Patrick might not find a job on the outside that provided health care. <P>     At Fort Campbell, Hart watched on  the Internet as George Galloway, an outspoken member of the British Parliament, castigated a U.S. Senate panel in  May 2005 over the war. Galloway derided  Iraq's alleged ties to al-Qaida and the  events of 9/11, and going to war over  weapons of mass destruction that never  materialized. <P>     "Right then and there, I started thinking about going to Canada," Hart said. <P>   His parents, Jim and Paula Hart, who  traveled with him, offered their son unconditional support. <P>     When Hart told his wife of his decision two days later - when he was officially AWOL - she was furious. <P>     Jill Hart had volunteered at Fort  Campbell, helping prepare families for  deployment as she had at Fort Riley. As  he expected, she told him she would have  to report him to higher-ups. She also  warned him that e-mails sent to her  would be forwarded to his commander. <P>     "I said I love you more than anything  in the world, but you're breaking the law.  The way I was raised is, you don't break  the law," Jill Hart said. <P>       Her devotion to the Army crumbled  days later, when she said the commander  warned the family's health coverage was  about to be cut off. <P>     "I hope Rian doesn't have another seizure," she said the commander told her. <P>     "When the commander said those  things to me, everything flashed. I've  bought into all this propaganda for nothing. They don't care about me, they don't  care about any of these families, they only  care about the one who can pull the trigger," Jill Hart said. <P>     Jill and Rian Hart joined Patrick in  Toronto about a month later. <P>     Maj. Crystal Oliver, an Army spokeswoman, said it was policy to curtail medical benefits to soldiers after they have  gone AWOL for more than 30 days, and  are officially considered deserters. <P>     The Army won't talk specifically about  Hart but issued a general statement  about deserters, who from Oct. 1, 2003, to  April 30, 2006, have left the Army at a  rate of 192 a month, according to the Army's own figures. <P>       "Soldiers serve in an all-volunteer Army because they choose to," said John  Emmert, a Fort Knox, Ky., spokesman.  "AWOL and desertion are crimes that go  against Army values, degrade unit readiness and ultimately reflect negatively on  us all." <P>     Hart acknowledges he is looked at as a  coward by many. Pointing to his nine  years of service, he says, "I went with the  whole intention of fighting. I had no idea  we were going to sit in Kuwait." <P>     Hart's attempt for refugee status in  Canada faces an uncertain outcome: No  American ever has received asylum north  of the border as a refugee. Two American  deserters, Brandon Huey and Jeremy  Hinsman, have had their refugee claims  rejected by Canada's Immigration and  Refugee Board, and are under appeal.
