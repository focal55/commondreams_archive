<p>    President George W. Bush&#39;s hopes of
attracting a new generation of voters to the Republican Party may
be fading, as younger Americans are far more critical of his job
performance than the broader population.          
<p> A Bloomberg/Los Angeles Times poll of Americans age 18 to 24
found Bush&#39;s approval rating was 20 percent, with 53 percent
disapproving and 28 percent with no opinion. That compares to a
40 percent approval rating among Americans of all ages in a
separate Bloomberg/Times poll.          </p>
       <p> Much like Franklin Roosevelt attracted a new generation of
voters with the New Deal, Bush and his administration have had
high hopes of drawing younger voters to his party. He has sought
to do that through policy initiatives aimed at creating an
``ownership society,&#39;&#39; and public relations tactics like a Youth
Convention at the party&#39;s 2004 national convention, in which his
twin daughters took the stage.          </p>
       <p> Among the initiatives aimed at drawing a new generation into
the Republican fold are health-care savings accounts, elimination
of the so-called marriage penalty in the U.S. tax code, and
Bush&#39;s proposal to create private investment accounts from a
portion of Social Security payroll taxes. `Younger Americans
really want to see some leadership,&#39;&#39; Bush said last year as he
launched his Social Security plan.          </p>

       <p> Instead, the Social Security initiative flopped in Congress
after attracting criticism from the public and lawmakers of both
parties, and health-care savings accounts haven&#39;t done much to
expand coverage, with only about 1 percent of the U.S. population
currently participating in them.          </p>
       <p> Social Issues          </p>
       <p> Bush&#39;s 2004 re-election strategy also may have damaged his
party&#39;s standing with younger voters by stressing things intended
to drive religious voters concerned about social issues to the
ballot box, such as opposition to gay marriage.          </p>
       <p> ``The very cultural issues the president wants to use to
rally his party&#39;s base are exactly the issues that are alienating
younger voters,&#39;&#39; said Ross Baker, a political scientist at
Rutgers University in New Brunswick, New Jersey. ``Across a broad
swath of social issues, younger Americans see the administration
as being out of line with what they believe.&#39;&#39;          </p>

       <p> The war in Iraq is also a major factor driving down public
opinion among young voters, said Hans Riemer, political director
at Rock the Vote, a group that works to get young people involved
in civic life.          </p>
       <p> ``Young people take it very personally,&#39;&#39; he said. ``They
feel like it&#39;s their generation that&#39;s been asked to sacrifice.&#39;&#39;          </p>
       <p> One poll participant, K.C. Chojnacki, an 18-year-old
starting her first year in college, expressed those concerns in a
follow-up interview. ``I disapprove mostly because I don&#39;t agree
with the war,&#39;&#39; said Chojnacki, who is from Andover, Minnesota.
``We&#39;re going to have to deal with the repercussions, like having
to pay for it.&#39;&#39;          </p>

       <p> Iraq Support Wanes          </p>
       <p> In October 2003, 40 percent of college students supported
either sending more troops to Iraq or keeping the number of
troops the same, according to a survey by Harvard University&#39;s
Institute of Politics in Cambridge, Massachusetts. By March 2006,
just 26 percent supported these measures, according to another
poll by the same institute, which has collected data on college
voters since 2000.          </p>
       <p> The Harvard surveys also showed an erosion of Republican
support among college students. In the 2003 poll, 31 percent
identified themselves as Republicans and 27 percent as Democrats.
By 2006, 32 percent of college students said they were Democrats
and 24 percent Republicans.          </p>
       <p> The Harvard polls surveyed 1,200 college students and had a
margin of error of 2.8 percentage points.          </p>

       <p> Disillusioned          </p>
       <p> David Kirby, executive director of the Washington-based
America&#39;s Future Foundation, which says it exists to groom young
libertarian and conservative leaders, said the president&#39;s low
approval rating reflects disillusionment with politics, not Bush
or the Republican Party.          </p>
       <p> ``It&#39;s overly simplistic to say people hate Bush, people
hate the war,&#39;&#39; Kirby said. While ``Republicans could do a better
job&#39;&#39; winning over young Americans, Kirby said, ``Democrats
aren&#39;t offering ideological vision for the future that&#39;s exciting
to young people.&#39;&#39;          </p>

       <p> Riemer cited ``a lack of any real attention at the White
House and Congress to issues that really do concern young people,
like education and jobs.&#39;&#39;          </p>
       <p> The Bloomberg/Los Angeles Times poll found Bush got slightly
higher approval ratings from religious young Americans than from
those who consider themselves non-religious.          </p>
       <p> For example, 26 percent of those age 18 to 24 who consider
themselves religious approve of the job Bush is doing, compared
with 12 percent of those who say they are non-religious. The poll
surveyed 811 adults aged 18-24 and 839 minors aged 12-17. It was
taken June 23 to July 2 and has a margin of error of 3 percentage
points.          </p>
       <p> If early indications are a guide, Bush and the Republicans
also have a challenge with the next wave of young voters. The
poll found his approval rating was 21 percent among those age 12
to 17, with 44 percent disapproving and 35 percent having no
opinion.          </p>
