<p>TURIN, Italy - Some athletes seize the moment and claim victory for themselves and no one else.<br>
              <br>
American speedskater Joey Cheek seized the moment, the day and perhaps something much larger Monday when he won an Olympic gold medal in the 500-meter long track sprint.<br>
<br>

Knowing he might soon be yesterday's news, Cheek grabbed his time in the spotlight and turned his attention to another, far less happy corner of the world.<br>

<br>
Cheek said he will donate his $25,000 gold-medal bonus to the <a href="http://www.righttoplay.com">Right to Play</a> organization, specifically targeting the aid to children at refugee camps in Chad who have fled what is being called a genocide in the neighboring Darfur region of Sudan.<br>
<br>
&quot;For me to walk away with a gold medal is just amazing, and the best way I can say thanks is to try to help somebody else,&quot; said Cheek, 24, who also announced he will retire after the Games to pursue a degree in economics.<br>
<br>
Cheek said he will urge his sponsors and sponsors of the Olympics and U.S. Speedskating to at least match his donation.<br>
<br>
Cheek has followed the footsteps on and off the ice of his speedskating hero, four-time gold medalist Johann Olaf Koss of Norway. In 1994, Koss donated his $30,000 bonus to the newly created organization, which was then known as Olympic Aid.<br>
<br>
Koss said he knows of no other athlete since then who has donated his gold-medal bonus.<br>

<br>
&quot;We are incredibly honored and humbled by his fantastic donation,&quot; Koss said in a phone interview from Turin. &quot;It was a big surprise.<br>
<br>
&quot;I am going to give him a big hug and thank him when I see him. It's incredible.&quot;<br>
<br>
Right to Play, based in Toronto, uses sports as a venue to teach children basic health, hygiene and HIV-AIDS prevention. It provides vaccinations and also conducts sport-related activities for physical and emotional development.<br>
<br>
&quot;I believe in what they are doing,&quot; Cheek said.<br>

<br>
Cheek had coffee with Koss on Friday and they talked about the charity. Cheek said he laid awake in bed Sunday night not certain what to do if he won. Monday morning, he walked into the Right to Play office in the athletes' village to learn more about how the organization used donations, and made his decision.<br>
<br>
Then all he had to do was win a gold medal. He made that look easy.<br>
<br>
Cheek's combined two-heat time of 69.76 was .65 seconds ahead of silver-medalist Dmitry Dorofeyev, a substantial margin in the one-lap sprint at Oval Lingotto. Cheek skated the fastest lap of the finals (34.82) in the first heat. He went out with plenty of room for error in the second heat and skated the second-fastest heat of the night (34.94).<br>
<br>
&quot;He not only won, he blew everybody away,&quot; said Casey FitzRandolph, who won the distance in 2002 and placed 12th Monday.<br>
<br>
Dorofeyev and Cheek were ranked 1-2 in the world in the event, although Cheek beat the Russian at the single-distance World Championships last month. Lee Kang-Seok of Korea was the surprise bronze medalist. <br>

<br>
Cheek captured America's second speedskating gold medal of the Games, after Chad Hedrick's 5,000-meter win Saturday.<br>
<br>
Cheek will skate against Hedrick in the 1,000 meters Sunday and said he will donate any bonus money he earns from that race as well. The U.S. Olympic Committee pays American medal winners $25,000 for gold, $15,000 for silver and $10,000 for bronze medals won.<br>
<br>
Cheek, from Greensboro, N.C., said he will visit Chad later this winter and is more motivated than ever to win another medal.<br>
<br>
&quot;I think on some level it is empowering to think of someone other than yourself,&quot; he said. &quot;What I do is honestly a pretty ridiculous thing. I mean, I skate around the ice in tights.<br>
<br>
&quot;But because I skated well and have a few seconds of microphone time, I have the ability to hopefully raise some awareness and raise some money. Maybe it will put some kids, God willing, on a path that I've been blessed with.&quot;
