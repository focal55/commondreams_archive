<p>Ethan Winsby considers himself in financial ruin at age 27  --  but not 
because he lost at gambling or risked everything on a startup that went bust.  
<P>Like a growing number of young adults, he had to take out private loans to 
attend college.  
<P>He graduated from the California Culinary Academy in San Francisco in 
2005, but he said his subsequent low-paying job as a cook has made it nearly 
impossible for him to repay the $35,000 he borrowed. 
<P>As the 18 percent interest rate compounded, his debt has soared to 
$50,000. The monthly payments, if he made them, would be two-thirds of his 
$1,200 monthly after-tax salary.  
<P>With no prospects of paying his loans off quickly, Winsby sees his debt 
spiraling out of control.  
<P>"At this rate, I'm going to be in default," he said. "Default means you 
have no options. It's the main source of stress in my life. It shouldn't be. I 
was trying to make a career for myself. I wish I hadn't even gone to school."  
<P>As the cost of college skyrockets and the federal government limits how 
much it will loan students, young adults increasingly are taking out private 
loans to finance their education.  
<P>The amount loaned to students nearly tripled between 2001 and 2006, from 
$6.1 billion to $17.3 billion, according to an annual student aid survey 
released Tuesday by the College Board.  
<P>"I am shocked and worried about the amount of debt these companies are 
encouraging students to take out," said Robert Shireman, executive director of 
the Project on Student Debt.  

<P>The trend is especially dangerous, he said, because such loans almost 
always carry a variable interest rate and lack the protections offered by 
federal loans, "so if interest rates go up, your private student loan can look 
like a credit card pretty quickly."  
<P>Recent changes in federal law make it nearly impossible to discharge any 
kind of student loan debt through bankruptcy. Instead, a borrower faces the 
possibility of a ruined credit rating or being forced into an unaffordable 
payment plan. 
<P>Education experts are calling on the federal government to raise the 
amount it will loan students and to give them more grants to keep them from 
having to turn to private loans to fill the gap.  
<P>Historically, private lenders have marketed loans to students in 
professional schools who have high earning potential once they graduate. But 
increasingly, they are targeting undergraduates.  
<P>One company, Loan to Learn, advertises on Google with this tantalizing ad: 
"Financial Aid Not Covering Your Costs? Get up to $50,000 in five days." The 
company will loan qualifying undergraduates $50,000 a year, up to $250,000.  
<P>The United States Student Association filed a complaint with the Federal 
Trade Commission in September saying that Loan to Learn engaged in "false and 
deceptive advertising practices" by encouraging students to view its private 
loans as a preferable alternative to federal grants and loans.  
<P>If the FTC finds a company has violated the law, it can seek a court order 
to require changes.  
<P>Loan to Learn officials deny misleading students and say they provide a 
needed service.  
<P>"To say that Loan to Learn doesn't have an interest in the students cuts 
to the core," said Catherine Reynolds, chairwoman and CEO. "What we do is 
simply try and help families have an option."  
<P>Students and families are finding it increasingly hard to pay for college. 
In the past five years, the cost of attending a public university has risen 35 
percent after adjusting for inflation, according to the College Board. 
Meanwhile, federal loan amounts have stagnated.  
<P>For example, under the most popular federal program, called Stafford, an 
undergraduate can borrow no more than $23,000 over five years  --  roughly what 
the average private university charges for a single year's tuition and fees. 
The maximum Pell Grant for needy students has stayed at $4,050 for three years. 
<P>Many students turn instead to private loans.  

<P>A decade ago, such high-interest loans represented 6 percent of all the 
cash loaned to students. Today they are 20 percent, according to the College 
Board. 
<P>When Beccie and Carl Smalls' son decided to attend Brooks Institute of 
Photography in Santa Barbara in 2002, they realized federal loans wouldn't come 
close to covering tuition and expenses.  
<P>The Smalls co-signed on two private loans totaling $50,300 through 
Stillwater Bank (which later sold the loans to the Sallie Mae company) so their 
son could get a lower interest rate. He racked up another $31,976 in private 
loans that his parents didn't co-sign  --  the interest rate on those ranged 
from about 12 to 17 percent  --  then dropped out to keep from going deeper 
into debt. 
<P>When his loans came due six months later, he didn't make enough money as a 
fledgling photographer to cover the $1,000 monthly payment. Sallie Mae agreed 
to postpone the due date two more years, but with compounding interest, his 
debt grew to at least $110,000. And because he didn't graduate, he couldn't 
consolidate his loans under a fixed interest rate, Beccie Small said.  
<P>As co-signers of two of the loans, the Smalls became fearful. What if 
their son failed to make his payments? A collection agency could ruin the 
Smalls' credit rating and eat up any savings they had.  

<P>In 2006, they took a second mortgage on their house to pay off the two 
loans they co-signed, which had grown from $50,300 to $67,200. Their son still 
owes $555 a month for the next 15 years on the rest of the loans. By the time 
he pays them, he will have given Sallie Mae $98,877. And the Smalls owe $712 a 
month to pay off their house loan. 
<P>"There should be more options for these kids," said Beccie Small. "There 
was one option for him  --  private loans. He wanted to go to school so bad, he 
took what they gave him."  
<P>Students often get into trouble because they don't fully understand the 
terms and agreements of what they're getting into, said Alan Collinge, who 
founded Student Loan Justice in Washington 18 months ago to collect stories of 
wronged students and to advocate for change. He did this after unemployment 
caused him to default on a $38,000 loan to attend the University of Southern 
California. That loan has grown to $105,000 with compounding interest, 
penalties and fees.  
<P>"College students are an extremely vulnerable segment of the population," 
Collinge said. "They will sign virtually anything you put in front of them." 
<P>Ethan Winsby feels like he signed away his freedom. Every night, he 
searches the Internet for a way out of the financial mess and wonders what will 
happen when Sallie Mae no longer allows him to put off the payments. In 
reviewing his situation, Sallie Mae spokesman Tom Joyce called Winsby an 
"unusual case" and said few of the company's borrowers have such high variable 
interest rates. He added that less than 2 percent of Sallie Mae's private loan 
borrowers default.  
<P>But higher-education experts counter that default rates are deceptive. 
Companies use techniques such as allowing borrowers to defer payments to avoid 
defaulting  --  but loan recipients still owe many times what they originally 
borrowed. 
<P>They say too many people are like Winsby, struggling with loans they might 
never be able to repay.  
<P>"What sense does it make to dig the hole deeper and create an underclass 
who because of their student loan default will never get out of debt?" asked 
Barmak Nassirian, associate executive director of the American Association of 
Collegiate Registrars and Admissions Officers. "We're marginalizing a 
significant portion of our population."

Protect yourself 

<P>Some tips for students facing the high cost 
of college: 
<P>--  Exhaust all federal loan possibilities as well as state and 
institutional grants and aid. 
<P>--  Ask questions. If the interest rate is variable, for example, ask the 
lender if there is a limit on how high the rate can go. For more questions, go 
to projectonstudentdebt.org/<A HREF="http://private_loan_questions.vp.html">private_loan_questions.vp.html</A>. 
<P>--  Talk to the financial-aid adviser at your college about the loan 
before agreeing to borrow the money. 
<P>--  Document everything. If you are offered a discount, get the terms in 
writing.
