SARASOTA, Florida -
Almost since the time the votes were tallied here on election night, the 
race for Florida's 13th Congressional District has been surrounded by a 
contentious mystery: 
<P>Why were there no votes for Congress recorded from more than 18,000 people 
who chose candidates in other races? 
<P>The answer is central not only to the outcome of the election, which for 
now has been won by Republican Vern Buchanan by a mere 369 votes and is in 
litigation, but also to the continuing debates over whether the electronic 
voting systems in use nationwide can yield reliable tallies and recounts.  
<P>So far, there are three theories, and lots of political and legal 
posturing. 
<P>Maybe, as scores of voters have said, there were glitches with the 
touch-screen systems and they dropped votes. 
<P>Or maybe voters overlooked the congressional race simply because of a 
confusing ballot design. 
<P>Or maybe, as some say, an astoundingly high number of Sarasota County 
residents decided to forgo voting in the high-profile race, which is for the 
seat being vacated by Katherine Harris, who presided over Florida's election 
apparatus during the much-disputed 2000 contest between President Bush and 
former vice president Al Gore. 

<P>On Tuesday, as state election officials in Sarasota ran a mock election to 
test the machines for defects, there were no clear answers. By evening, as 
clerical workers input votes, no major problems were reported with the 
machines, but the review will continue through the week. 
<P>"Our analysis of the results shows that something went very wrong," said 
Kendall Coffey, an attorney for Buchanan's challenger, Christine Jennings. He 
played down the significance of the tests, saying they did not  replicate the 
voting because the state clerical workers were presumably more adept at the 
machinery than voters in general would be. 
<P>Hayden Dempsey, an attorney for Buchanan, said: "There is nothing wrong 
with the machines, as these tests show." 
<P>The essence of the dispute arises from the fact that once all the votes 
were counted in the Nov. 7 election, a troubling anomaly appeared in the tally. 
<P>More than 18,000 people who had voted in other contests did not have 
selections recorded in the congressional race. 
<P>The phenomenon of voters casting ballots without making selections in 
every race is known as "undervoting," and it happens in virtually every big 
election, particularly in contests for lesser-known offices that some voters 
ignore. 
<P>But the magnitude of the undervoting in the Buchanan-Jennings race was 
startling  --  about 15 percent of those who cast ballots in Sarasota. By 
contrast, it was about 2.5 percent among voters in other counties. 
<P>Jennings has filed a lawsuit alleging that thousands of Sarasota County 
votes were not counted because of "the pervasive malfunctioning of electronic 
voting machines." The county tilts in her favor. 
<P>The broken-machine theory is backed by two voting experts and scores of 
sworn statements from voters who had trouble with the machines, Coffey said. 
The Sarasota Herald-Tribune has reported that more than 100 have reported 
problems with the machines. 
<P>But other experts who have analyzed the ballots and the results argue that 
the culprit might be not the machines but rather voters confused by a poorly 
designed ballot. 
<P>The congressional race appeared on the same screen as the gubernatorial 
contest, which had a brighter banner and took up more space. Ted Selker of the 
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, a director of the CalTech/MIT Voting 
Technology Project, said tests in his lab have shown that as many as 60 percent 
of voters can miss races when they are displayed in such a manner.
