<p> The Government has been accused of reneging on pledges to control private security companies operating in Iraq because it wants to "privatise the war" as part of its exit strategy. 
<p>
  The Government has not only failed to bring in legislation promised four 
  years ago, but has actively encouraged security firms in Iraq by giving them 
  multimillion -pound contracts to take over duties which could have been 
  performed by British forces, says the report published today by the charity 
  War on Want.
</p>
<p>
  Humanitarian groups, MPs and international lawyers have called for tighter 
  controls on "mercenaries".
</p>
<p>
  In Britain both the Foreign Office and the Ministry of Defence are believed 
  to favour such a move. But, with the clamour for withdrawal from Iraq, 
  Downing Street is said to view the private firms as a favoured option in 
  expediting the pullout.
</p>
<p>
  War on Want's campaigns director, John Hilary, said: "There are genuine 
  worries that the Government is trying to privatise the Iraq conflict. The 
  occupation of Iraq has allowed British mercenaries to reap huge profits. But 
  the Government has failed to enact laws to punish their human rights abuses, 
  including firing on Iraqi civilians.
</p>

<p>
  "How can Tony Blair hope to restore peace and security in Iraq while 
  allowing mercenary armies to operate completely outside the law?"
</p>
<p>
  The study charts how the result has been boom times for security firms with 
  the industry making $100bn a year (&pound;53bn), mainly from Iraq and Afghanistan, 
  with British firms among some of the top earners. Just one firm, Aegis 
  Defence Services, run by Col Tim Spicer, who was formerly enmeshed in the 
  controversy over supplying arms to Sierra Leone, has increased its turnover 
  from &pound;554,000 before the war began in 2003 to &pound;62m last year.
</p>
<p>
  While British troop levels in Iraq currently stand at 7,200 - with plans to 
  halve this number in the next six months - there are almost 21,000 British 
  private security guards, part of an international force of 48,000 described 
  by US senators as the "largest private army in the world".
</p>
<p>
  The report, Corporate Mercenaries: The threat of private military and 
  security companies, comes on the same day the British security industry 
  holds its first annual conference in London, and also on the deadline given 
  by the US General George Casey to improve security in Iraq. On Friday a 
  National Audit Office report is expected to warn that Britain's armed forces 
  are failing to recruit and retain sufficient soldiers to deliver the "
  required military capability".

</p>
<p>
  In Iraq, all non-Iraqi military personnel and private military contractors 
  were made immune from prosecution under the Coalition Provisional 
  Authority's Order 17 for acts performed within terms of their contract by 
  Paul Bremer, the American head of the CPA in June 2004.
</p>
<p>
  It is unclear whether that has changed since the inauguration of the new 
  Iraqi government. But, while British and American soldiers have faced courts 
  martial over alleged crimes carried out in Iraq, not one security contractor 
  has been prosecuted at home or in Iraq despite a significant number of 
  allegations of abuse.
</p>

  * The Foreign Office has confirmed that staff are to be evacuated from the 
  British consulate in Basra because of an increased number mortar and rocket 
  attacks. They will leave the heavily fortified compound of Basra Palace for 
  the relative safety of Basra airport. Key staff will remain in the palace, a 
  spokeswoman said.
