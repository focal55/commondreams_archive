The scientists said about 40 countries possess enough plutonium or uranium to construct substantial nuclear arsenals. Setting off a Hiroshima-size weapon could cause as many direct fatalities as all of <a href="http://www.livescience.com/history/061003_ap_war_sub.html">World War II</a>. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&quot;Considering the relatively small number and size of the weapons, the effects are surprisingly large,&quot; said one of the researchers, Richard Turco of the University of California, Los Angeles.&nbsp; &quot;The potential devastation would be catastrophic and long term.&quot; </p>
<p>The lingering effects could re-shape the <a href="http://www.livescience.com/environment/">environment</a> in ways never conceived. In terms of <a href="http://www.livescience.com/environment/061103_climatechange_survey.html">climate</a>, a nuclear blast could plunge temperatures across large swaths of the globe. &quot;It would be the largest climate change in recorded human history,&quot; Alan Robock, associate director of the Center for Environmental Prediction at Rutgers' Cook College and another member of the research team.</p>

<p>The results will be presented here today during the annual meeting of American Geophysical Union.</p>
<p><strong>Blast fatalities</strong></p>
<p>In one study, scientists led by Owen &quot;Brian&quot; Toon of the University of Colorado, Boulder, analyzed potential fatalities based on current nuclear weapons inventories and population densities in large cities around the world. </p>
<p>His team focused on the black smoke generated by a <a href="http://www.livescience.com/technology/060613_nuclear_bomb.html">nuclear blast</a> and firestorms&mdash;intense and long-lasting fires that create and sustain their own wind systems.&nbsp; </p>
<p>For a regional conflict, fatalities would range from 2.6 million to 16.7 million per country. &quot;A small country is likely to direct its weapons against population centers to maximize damage and achieve the greatest advantage,&quot; Toon said. </p>

<p><strong>Chilled climate</strong></p>
<p>With the information, Robock and colleagues generated a series of computer simulations of potential climate anomalies caused by a small-scale nuclear war. </p>
<p>&quot;We looked at a scenario of a regional nuclear conflict say between India and Pakistan where each of them used 50 weapons on cities in the other country that would generate a lot of smoke,&quot; Robock told <em>LiveScience</em>. </p>
<p>They discovered the smoke emissions would plunge temperatures by about 2 degrees Fahrenheit (1.25 degrees Celsius) over large areas of North America and Eurasia&mdash;areas far removed from the countries involved in the conflict. </p>
<p>Typically when <a href="http://www.livescience.com/environment/050505_earth_bright.html">sunlight</a> travels through the atmosphere, some rays get absorbed by particles in the air, before reaching Earth's surface. After a nuclear blast, however, loads of black smoke would settle into the upper atmosphere and absorb <a href="http://www.livescience.com/forcesofnature/060124_earth_albedo.html">sunlight</a> before it reaches our planet's surface. Like a dark curtain pulled over large parts of the globe, the smoke would cause cool temperatures, darkness, less precipitation and even <a href="http://www.livescience.com/environment/060928_ozone_upate.html">ozone depletion</a>. </p>

<p>At the end of the 10 years, the simulated <a href="http://www.livescience.com/weather/">climate</a> still hadn't recovered.&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong>Global upshot</strong></p>
<p>The study showed it doesn't take much <a href="http://www.livescience.com/technology/ap_050523_sun_laser.html">nuclear power</a> to drive meteoric results. Whereas the scenarios presumed the countries involved would launch their entire nuclear arsenals, that total is just three-hundredths of a percent of the global arsenal. </p>
<p>Will the conclusions result in worldly changes? &quot;We certainly hope there will be a political response because nuclear weapons are the most dangerous potential environmental danger to the planet. They're much more dangerous than <a href="http://www.livescience.com/environment/061206_phytoplankton_warming.html">global warming</a>,&quot; Robock said.</p>
