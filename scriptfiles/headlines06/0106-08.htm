<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p>Anti-war activists are to picket the offices of the Irish Aviation Authority in Dublin today over the ongoing refuelling of US warplanes at Shannon Airport.<br>
<br>More than 330,000 US troops passed through the Mid-West hub during 2005 – more than double the number for 2004.<br><br>Pressure has been mounting on the Government to search the flights for military weapons or terror suspects en route to alleged CIA interrogation camps.<br><br>Foreign Affairs Minister Dermot Ahern has insisted that the Irish Government accepts the assurances of US authorities that nothing untoward is taking place.<br><br>He called for credible evidence of any wrongdoing to be passed onto the Gardaí.<br><br>Pitstop Ploughshare spokesman Ciaron O’Reilly, who organised today’s protest, said the use of Shannon Airport was increasing Ireland’s involvement in the war in Iraq.<br><br>“The Government is pulling the country deeper and deeper into complicity for the illegal war,” Mr O’Reilly said.<br><br>Anti-war protesters previously staged a sit-in at the Aviation Authority building during the Ramadan festival in 2003.<br><br>A new Peace Camp is to be re-established at Shannon Airport this weekend.<br><br>Local Co Clare councillor Martin Conway has called for members of the Defence Forces to be deployed at the airport to search US military aircraft.<br><br>Influential US academic Noam Chomsky has also questioned whether Taoiseach Bertie Ahern is following the will of the Irish people or following orders from Washington by allowing the stop-overs of US warplanes.<br><br>Speaking in an interview recorded last May but published last week, Dr Chomsky added: “It [refuelling of US military aircraft] can only be justified if the goal of the Government is to be the obedient servant of the global superpower [the US].”
