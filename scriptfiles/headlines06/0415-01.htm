<p>NEW YORK --  As an E&amp;P "Pressing Issues" <a href="http://www.editorandpublisher.com/eandp/columns/pressingissues_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1002312625" target="_new"><u>column</u></a> recently noted, rock star Neil Young is the son of a famed Canadian journalist,  so it should not surprise many that he recently recorded a song in California with a very reportorial -- or at least pundit -- feel to it.  
<p>It&rsquo;s called &ldquo;Impeach the President,&rdquo; so there can be little question what it is about.  
<p>Apparently it was recorded with a 100-voice choir.   Rumors have circulated the past few days on the Web, but E&amp;P has tracked down the strongest confirmation in a blog kept by Sherman Oaks, Ca. musician/singer Alicia Morgan.
<p>Previous reports quoted hints by Young and Jonathan Demme (who directed the new documentary &ldquo;Heart of Gold&rdquo;) that Neil was working on a hard-rocking political or &ldquo;anti-Bush&rdquo; CD.
<p>Last Friday, Morgan wrote on her LastLeftB4Hooterville blog that she had been &ldquo;summoned&rdquo; to a local studio to sing on the new record with 99 others. &ldquo;I'm not going to give the whole thing away, but the first line of one of the songs was &lsquo;Let's impeach the President for lyin'!&rsquo; Turns out the whole thing is a classic beautiful protest record. The session was like being at a 12-hour peace rally. Every time new lyrics would come up on the screen, there were cheers, tears and applause. It was a spiritual experience. I can't believe my good fortune at being a part of this.
<p>&ldquo;We finished the session by singing an a capella version of 'America the Beautiful' and there was not a dry eye in the house.
<p>&ldquo;Neil said it should be out in 6 to 8 weeks."
<p>Harp magazine reported on its Web site Thursday that Demme had confirmed in an e-mail,  &ldquo;Neil just finished writing and recording -- with no warning -- a new album called 'Living With War.' It all happened in three days&hellip; It is a brilliant electric assault, accompanied by a 100-voice choir, on Bush and the war in Iraq&hellip; Truly mind blowing. Will be in stores soon.&rdquo;
<p>The magazine continued:  &ldquo;Details are pretty scarce, but the featured track, titled &lsquo;Impeach the President,&rsquo; features a rap with Bush&rsquo;s voice set to the choir chanting &lsquo;flip/flop&rsquo; and the like.&rdquo;
<p>Young has always been a maverick politically as well as musically.  Although he has recorded a few songs that drew cheers from liberals, such as "Ohio" and "Southern Man,"  he also drew criticism from the left for pro-Reagan comments many years ago.</p>
