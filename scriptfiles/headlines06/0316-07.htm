        US forces and the Iraqi army today launched what was termed the largest air 
  assault since the US-led invasion, targeting insurgent strongholds north of 
  the capital.
<p>
   "More than 1,500 Iraqi and Coalition troops, over 200 tactical 
  vehicles, and more than 50 aircraft participated in the operation," the 
  military statement said. The attack was designed to "clear a suspected 
  insurgent operating area northeast of Samarra" - 60 miles north of 
  Baghdad.
</p>
<p>
  The military said the operation was expected to continue over several days 
  against insurgent targets in Salahuddin province, where Samarra is a key 
  city.
</p>
<p>

  The assault was launched just hours before Iraq's new parliament was sworn 
  behind the concrete blast walls of the heavily fortified Green Zone - with 
  parties still deadlocked over the next government, vehicles banned from 
  Baghdad's streets to prevent car bombings and the country under the shadow 
  of a feared civil war.
</p>
<p>
  The long-expected first session, which took place within days of the third 
  anniversary of the US-led invasion, lasted just 40 minutes and was adjourned 
  indefinitely because there still was no agreement on a permanent speaker for 
  the legislature and his deputies.
</p>
<p>
  Salahuddin province is a major part of the so-called Sunni triangle where 
  insurgents have been active since shortly after the invasion. Saddam Hussein 
  was captured in the province, not far from its capital, Tikrit. On Feb. 22, 
  bombers destroyed an important Shiite shrine in the city, triggering a wave 
  of sectarian killing that has claimed hundreds of lives.
</p>
<p>
  Waqas al-Juwanya, a spokesman for the provincial government's joint 
  coordination center in nearby Dowr, said "unknown gunmen exist in this 
  area, killing and kidnapping policemen, soldiers and civilians."
</p>
<p>
  Near the end of the first day of the operation, the military said, a number 
  of weapons caches had been captured, containing artillery shells, 
  explosives, bomb-making materials, and military uniforms.

</p>
<p>
  It said the attack began with soldiers from the Iraqi Army's 1st Brigade, 
  4th Division, the 101st Airborne Division's 3rd Brigade Combat Team and the 
  101st Combat Aviation Brigade conducting a combined air and ground assault 
  to isolate the targeted area.
</p>
<p>
  Air power backed the operation and delivered troops from the Iraq Army's 4th 
  Division, the Rakkasans from 1st and 3rd Battalions, 187th Infantry Regiment 
  and the Hunters from 2nd Squadron, 9th Cavalry Regiment to multiple 
  objectives.
</p>
<p>
  The military said forces from the 2nd Commando Brigade then completed a 
  ground infiltration to secure numerous structures in the area. There was no 
  immediate word on casualties.
</p>
<p>
  In Baghdad, Adnan Pachachi, the senior politician who administered the oath 
  in the absence of a speaker of parliament, spoke of a country in crisis.
</p>

<p>
   "We have to prove to the world that a civil war is not and will not 
  take place among our people," Pachachi told lawmakers. "The danger 
  is still looming and the enemies are ready for us because they do not like 
  to see a united, strong, stable Iraq."
</p>
<p>
  As Pachachi spoke, he was interrupted from the floor by senior Shiite leader 
  Abdul-Aziz al-Hakim, who said the remarks were inappropriate because of 
  their political nature.
</p>
<p>
  Even the oath was a source of disagreement, with the head of the committee 
  that drafted the country's new constitution, Humam Hammoudi, protesting that 
  lawmakers had strayed from the text. After brief consultations, judicial 
  officials agreed the wording was acceptable and the session adjourned until 
  further notice.
</p>
<p>
  Acting Prime Minister Ibrahim al-Jaafari told reporters after the brief 
  session, "If politicians work seriously, we can have a government 
  within a month."
</p>
<p>

  Al-Jaafari's candidacy for a second term as prime minister is at the center 
  of the political logjam that delayed parliament's first session for over a 
  month after the results of Dec. 15 elections were approved.
</p>
<p>
  Under the constitution, the largest parliamentary bloc, controlled by 
  Shiites, has the right to nominate the prime minister. Al-Jaafari won the 
  Shiite nomination by a single vote last month.
</p>
<p>
  Politicians involved in the negotiations have said part of the Shiite bloc, 
  those aligned with al-Hakim, would like to see al-Jaafari ousted but fear 
  the consequences, given his backing from radical cleric Muqtada al-Sadr and 
  al-Sadr's thousands-strong Mahdi Army.
</p>
<p>
  Sunni, Kurdish and some secular Shiites argue al-Jaafari is too divisive and 
  accuse him of not doing enough to contain waves of revenge killing after 
  bombers destroyed the Shiite shrine in Samarra and ripped apart teeming 
  markets in an al-Sadr stronghold in Baghdad on Sunday.
</p>
<p>
  US officials have been pressing political leaders to reach agreement on a 
  national unity government, under which the country's majority Shiite Muslims 
  would share Cabinet posts equitably with minority Sunnis and Kurds.

</p>
<p>
  The Americans see that as the best opportunity for blunting the Sunni-driven 
  insurgency that has ravaged the country since 2003. If a strong central 
  government were in place, Washington had hoped to start removing some troops 
  by summer.
</p>
<p>
  Parliament's inaugural session started the clock on a 60-day period in which 
  parliament must elect a president and approve a prime minister and Cabinet.
</p>
<p>
  Hours after the session adjourned, two mortar shells were fired into the 
  Green Zone, said al-Mohammedawi, the Interior Ministry official. There were 
  no immediate reports of casualties.
</p>
<p>
  Police discovered 29 more bodies discarded in various parts of Baghdad late 
  Wednesday and Thursday. The victims were all men, some with their hands 
  bound, who had been shot execution-style and dumped in both Shiite and Sunni 
  Muslim neighborhoods, said Interior Ministry official Lt. Col. Falah 
  al-Mohammedawi.

</p>
<p>
  North of the capital, a roadside bomb exploded near a girl's primary school 
  near Baqouba, killing three students aged 12-13 and injuring two others, 
  police said.
</p>
<p>
  Another bomb missed a US patrol in Mosul, killing one civilian and wounding 
  three others, police said. Four more people were killed in a drive-by 
  shooting in the city.
</p>
<p>
  In Ramadi, residents picked through the rubble of a home they said was 
  destroyed in a US raid. Residents have reported repeated clashes in the city 
  in an insurgent-plagued area west of Baghdad.
</p>
<p>
  Recent AP Television News video showed a gunbattle in which a gasoline truck 
  was set on fire, and at a separate location the killing of an unidentified 
  man with heavy gunfire audible in the background. The US military has not 
  responded to repeated requests for information.
</p>

<p>
  Parliament's first meeting coincided with the anniversary of a poison gas 
  attack by Saddam Hussein's army on the northern city of Halabja 18 years 
  ago. Nearly 2,000 Kurdish demonstrators, angry over what they see as the 
  regional government's failure to rebuild the area, went on a rampage 
  Thursday and badly damaged a monument to the 5,000 residents killed. Police 
  fired live ammunition into the air, killing one person and wounding at least 
  eight.
</p>
<p>
  Saddam ordered the poison gas attack as part of a scorched-earth campaign to 
  crush a Kurdish rebellion in northern Iraq. Current President Jalal 
  Talabani, a former Kurdish guerrilla leader, said Thursday, "the 
  Halabja anniversary inspires us to continue our struggle against 
  dictatorship."
</p>
<p>
  South of Samarra on Wednesday, a US airstrike killed 11 people &mdash; most of 
  them women and children, said police and relatives of the victims. The US 
  military said it captured the target of the raid, a man suspected of 
  supporting foreign fighters of the al-Qaida in Iraq terror network.
</p>
<p>
  But the military said it could only account for four people killed &mdash; a man, 
  two women and a child. "That doesn't meant that we dispute 11," 
  said Maj. Tim Keefe, a military spokesman.

</p>
<p>
  He said the suspect was captured as he fled the house, but US troops were 
  taking fire from the building and called in an airstrike. He did not specify 
  whether the strike near Balad, 80 kilometers (50 miles) north of Baghdad, 
  involved warplanes or gunships.
</p>
<p>
  AP photographs showed the bodies of two men, five children and four other 
  blanketed figures arriving at a hospital in nearby Tikrit, accompanied by 
  grief-stricken relatives.
