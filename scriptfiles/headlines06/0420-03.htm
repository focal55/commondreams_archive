  Jack Straw has warned Cabinet colleagues that it would be illegal for 
  Britain to support the United States in military action against Iran. But 
  Tony Blair has backed President George Bush by warning that ruling out 
  military action would send out a &quot;message of weakness&quot; to Iran.
</p>


        
          
          
            <p>
  Differences opened up yesterday between Mr Blair and the Foreign Secretary 
  over growing alarm in the US at the refusal of Mr Bush to rule out military 
  action. Mr Straw said on BBC Radio 4 that it was "inconceivable" 
  that Britain would support a military strike against Tehran. Four hours 
  later, Mr Blair refused to go that far when challenged to do so at Prime 
  Minister's questions by the former minister, Michael Meacher.
</p>
<p>
  Mr Blair accused Iran of fostering international terrorism, and said young 
  people were signing up to be suicide bombers directed at US and UK targets. "
I do not think this is the time to send a message of weakness," he said.

</p>
<p>
  Mr Straw has told ministerial colleagues he does not believe that the 
  Attorney General, Lord Goldsmith, would approve the legality of British 
  action, because Iran does not pose a direct threat to Britain. Mr Straw also 
  said it would be "nuts" to consider a nuclear strike.
</p>
<p>
  The possibility of action against Iran threatens to resurrect the row over 
  the basis on which Britain went to war in Iraq. The Attorney General became 
  embroiled in the legal advice he gave to the Prime Minister over the war. 
</p>
<p>
  Clare Short, the former cabinet minister, said the Cabinet had never been 
  shown the full legal advice and there were claims that Lord Goldsmith may 
  have changed his view under pressure from Mr Blair.
</p>
<p>
  Some Labour MPs say Mr Straw was wrong to rule out military action, and 
  accuse him of bowing to pressure from the strong Muslim population in his 
  Blackburn constituency. 
</p>

<p>
  But most Labour MPs support Mr Straw's strategy and would revolt if Mr Blair 
  showed any sign of lending support to a US strike against Iran. Mr Straw was 
  given tacit support at a meeting of European foreign ministers in Luxembourg 
  last week.
</p>
<p>
  France understands Mr Blair's argument that keeping the military option on 
  the table would keep up the pressure on Iran. But it is to urge London to 
  press the Bush administration to soften its approach so it no longer treats 
  Iran as a "rogue state" but engages in a wider dialogue with 
  Tehran on terrorism, the Middle East peace process and oil.
</p>
<p>
  Yesterday there was a rare, informal meeting of US and Iranian embassy 
  diplomats at the Commons organised by the Foreign Policy Centre think-tank 
  to launch its pamphlet Understanding Iran. 
</p>
<p>
  Diplomatic contacts between Iran and the US have been infrequent since 
  students occupied the US embassy in Tehran 26 years ago. Pam Telford, who 
  handles proliferation issues for the US embassy, denied Washington had 
  aggravated the problem by having no clear policy towards Iran, or by having 
  double standards about which Asian states are allowed to have nuclear 
  weapons. 
</p>
<p>

  The Iranian charge d'affaires, Hamid Reza Arefi, denied Iran intended to 
  develop nuclear weapons.
