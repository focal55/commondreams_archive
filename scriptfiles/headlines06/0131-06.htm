<p>  DAVOS, Switzerland - 

The Swiss Alpine ski resort of Davos has never suffered a disaster like Hurricane Katrina, which left 1,326 people dead and 6,644 missing after passing through the southeastern U.S. city of New Orleans last August. <br>
<b><br>
</b>In fact, the cultural, social and climatic differences between the cities 
are so vast that they seem to share almost nothing in common, except perhaps 
for the fact that both attract large numbers of tourists.

      But according to New Orleans community activist Jay Arena, there is another 
common link that the two cities share: the power exerted by politically 
conservative, economically neoliberal power elites.
<br><br>
Davos is the host city for the annual World Economic Forum (WEF) gathering 
of the world's political, economic and business elites, described by Arena 
as "a group of unelected, unresponsive, unaccountable capitalist elites 
meeting in private" to chart out the future of the entire planet.
<br><br>
This process is strikingly similar to the Bring New Orleans Back Commission 
established by Mayor Ray Nagin to oversee post-hurricane reconstruction 
efforts, Arena told IPS.
<br><br>
Many have criticised the mayor's commission as being highly stacked with 
business leaders and real estate developers. As a result, Arena noted, 
people like real estate mogul Joseph Canizaro, "one of the biggest 
contributors to the (George W.) Bush administration," will now have the 
power to make plans that will affect "the lives of tens of thousands, or 
hundreds of thousands of people in New Orleans."
<br><br>
"And at the same time, they try to co-opt some community organisations and 
labour unions to legitimise their criminal enterprise," he added.
<br><br>
Arena, a member of the C3/Hands Off Iberville Coalition, founded to defend 
public housing in New Orleans, was one of the keynote speakers at The Other 
Davos, a "counter forum" to the WEF meet organised last week in Zurich by 
the Swiss affiliate of ATTAC (Association for the Taxation of Financial 
Transactions for the Aid of Citizens) and other anti-globalisation civil 
society organisations.
<br><br>
Arena said he was glad to accept the invitation from ATTAC to speak in 
Zurich because "we consider our struggle an international one."
<br><br>
"What happens in New Orleans will have great implications on how the city is 
rebuilt," he noted, but at the same time, "it will have great implications 
for working people around the world."

<br><br>
"We want the solidarity to support people fighting for justice and against 
racism around the world," he stressed.
<br><br>
Arena and other community activists in New Orleans "are involved in a life 
and death struggle at the grassroots level to allow working class people, 
black people, to return to this world treasure known as the city of New 
Orleans."
<br><br>
From a cultural point of view, New Orleans is "the most African city in 
North America," Arena maintained. The unique traditions that draw visitors 
to the city - including the music, food, and other cultural expressions - 
were largely created by working class people, and especially black working 
class people.
<br>
<br>
It was the predominantly black, working class areas of New Orleans that 
suffered the greatest destruction from Hurricane Katrina, forcing their 
residents to take shelter elsewhere, and according to Arena, "the ruling 
elites are doing everything in their power to prevent them from returning."
<br><br>
One of the most controversial recommendations made by the Bring New Orleans 
Back Commission was a proposed four-month moratorium on rebuilding, 
allegedly to ensure that neighbourhoods have the "critical mass" needed to 
prevent large areas of empty, derelict houses.
<br><br>
But critics of this measure believe it is aimed at keeping the city's poor, 
black residents from returning, in order to grab up their former 
neighbourhoods for redevelopment.
<br><br>
This situation has given rise to a "life and death struggle," Arena said, 
because "the people are the city, and if they don't come back, it will be 
the death of New Orleans and all that it has been."
<br><br>
What is happening today in New Orleans, he maintained, is an example of 
"ethnic cleansing," and it is a process that both pre-dates Hurricane 
Katrina and extends to many other parts of the United States.
<br><br>

There has been a concerted effort by the real estate and tourism industries 
and other key business sectors to drive out black and working class 
communities in cities like Chicago, Washington and Miami, as well as New 
Orleans, and public housing in particular has been under attack as part of 
this scheme, he said.
<br><br>
Arena cited the example of the St. Thomas housing development, a 
1,500-apartment public housing community along the riverside in New Orleans.
<br><br>
In the 1990s, during the Bill Clinton administration, this entire community 
was destroyed, and in its place only a handful of public housing units were 
built, alongside spacious, high-rise apartments that black, working class 
people cannot afford, he reported.
<br><br>
"We saw that as one example of class and ethnic cleansing, moving out poor, 
black, working class people from the centre of the city," said Arena. "And 
we see now that they are using the hurricane as an opportunity to do what 
they did to St. Thomas to the whole city of New Orleans."
<br><br>
Arena accused Mayor Nagin and his commission of not only wanting to drive 
out public housing, but also showing no interest in rebuilding 
neighbourhoods that were predominantly made up of black and working class 
residents.
<br><br>
Instead, he maintained, they would prefer to bulldoze these neighbourhoods 
and leave them as green areas, turn public housing developments over to 
commercial and industrial uses, and replace public schools with high-priced 
private schools.
<br><br>
On the positive side, as the intentions of the city's elites have become 
more clear, "the lines are being more clearly drawn, and so there are more 
people standing up and speaking out," said Arena.
