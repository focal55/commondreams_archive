Annual war expenditures in Iraq will almost certainly come close to 
doubling since the U.S. invasion, as the military confronts the rapidly 
escalating cost of repairing, rebuilding and replacing equipment chewed up by 
three years of combat.
<P>The cost of the war in U.S. fatalities has declined this year, but the 
cost in treasure continues to rise  --  from $48 billion in 2003 to $59 billion 
in 2004 to $81 billion in 2005 to an anticipated $94 billion in 2006, according 
to the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments.  
<P>The U.S. government is now spending nearly $10 billion a month in Iraq and 
Afghanistan, up from $8.2 billion a year ago, a new Congressional Research 
Service report found. 
<P>Annual war costs in Iraq are easily outpacing the $61 billion a year that 
the United States spent in Vietnam between 1964 and 1972, in today's dollars. 
The Iraq invasion's "shock and awe" phase of high-tech laser-guided bombs, 
cruise missiles and stealth aircraft has long faded, but the costs of even 
those early months are just coming into view as the military confronts 
equipment repair and rebuilding costs it has avoided and procurement costs it 
never expected. 
<P>"We did not predict early on that we would have the number of electronic 
jammers that we've got. We did not predict we'd have as many (heavily) armored 
vehicles that we have, nor did we have a good prediction about what our battle 
losses would be," Army Chief of Staff Gen. Peter Schoomaker recently told the 
Senate Armed Services Committee. 

<P>"If you look at the earlier estimates of anticipated costs, this war is a 
lot more expensive than it should be based on past conflicts," said Steven 
Kosiak, director of budget studies for the Center for Strategic and Budgetary 
Assessments, an independent defense think tank. 
<P>The issue will be hotly debated next week when the Senate takes up a 
record $106.5 billion emergency spending bill that includes $72.4 billion for 
the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. The House passed a $92 billion version of the 
bill last month that included $68 billion in war funding. That comes on top of 
$50 billion already allocated for the war this fiscal year. 
<P>The bill is the fifth emergency defense request since the Iraq invasion in 
March 2003. Senate Democrats say that, in the end, they will vote for the 
measure, which congressional leaders plan to deliver to President Bush by 
Memorial Day. But the upcoming debate will offer opponents of the war ample 
opportunity to question the Bush administration's funding priorities. 
<P>At roughly $15 billion, personnel costs will actually drop 14 percent this 
year. But Pentagon officials and budget analysts point to a simple, unavoidable 
driver of the escalating costs  --  the cost of repairing and replacing 
equipment and developing new war-fighting materiel has exploded. In the first 
year of the invasion, such costs totaled $2.4 billion, then rose to $5.2 
billion in 2004. This year, they will hit $26 billion, and could go as high as 
$30 billion, Kosiak said. 
<P>Total operations and maintenance budgets will rise 33 percent this year, 
while investment in new technologies will climb 25 percent, according to the 
Congressional Research Service. 
<P>The helicopters, tanks, personnel carriers and even small arms "have 
required more maintenance than we planned for," said Gary Motsek, director of 
support operations at the Army Materiel Command. "We're working them to death." 
<P>In the first years of the war, Army and Marine units rotating out of Iraq 
left behind usable equipment for the next units rolling in. But even the 
working equipment is now being shipped back to the Army's five depots, where 
they are refurbished and upgraded. 
<P>Last year, the depots repaired and upgraded 600 helicopter engines. This 
year, they will see 700, Motsek said. A total of 318 Bradley fighting vehicles 
went through the depots in 2005; 600 will be cycled through in 2006. 
<P>Last year, depot workers upgraded 5,000 humvees with new engines and new 
transmissions to support ever-heavier armor. This year, they will see close to 
9,000. They also will have to patch up 7,000 more machine guns, 5,000 more tank 
tracks and 100 more M1A1 Abrams tanks. 
<P>In 2001, the depots logged 11 million labor hours. Last year, that reached 
20 million, and this year, it will total 24 million, Motsek said.  
<P>And that is only the work being done in the United States. In and around 
Iraq, 53,000 people  --  52,000 of them contractors  --  are maintaining and 
rebuilding lightly damaged equipment, a senior Senate defense aide said. Indian 
workers are refurbishing U.S. humvees for $6 an hour. 
<P>"The equipment is wearing out five times faster than (in) normal 
operations," said Jeremiah Gertler, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic 
and International Studies and a former House Armed Services Committee staffer. 
<P>What cannot be repaired has to be replaced. Procurement costs were a 
fraction of the initial emergency war requests, Kosiak said. This year, new 
equipment purchases will consume 20 percent of the war funds. 
<P>Such costs were always there, Gertler said, but Bush administration 
officials and members of Congress put off maintenance and procurement 
expenditures to keep the war price tag down.
