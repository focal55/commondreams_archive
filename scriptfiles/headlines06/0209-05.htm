LONDON  - Global warming is already causing death 
and disease across the world through flooding, environmental 
destruction, heatwaves and other extreme weather events, 
scientists said on Thursday.
<p> And it is likely to get worse.</p><p> In a review published in The Lancet medical journal, the 
scientists said there was now a near-unanimous scientific 
consensus that rising levels of greenhouse gases would cause 
global warming and other climate changes.</p><p> "The advent of changes in global climate signals that we 
are now living beyond the Earth's capacity to absorb a major 
waste product," said Anthony McMichael of the Australian 
National University in Canberra and his colleagues, referring 
to greenhouse gases.</p><p> The scientists' review of dozens of scientific papers over 
the last five years said health risks were likely to get worse 
over time as climate change and other environmental and social 
changes deepened.</p><p> "The resultant risks to health ... are anticipated to 
compound over time as climate change along with other large 
scale environmental and social changes continues," they wrote.</p><p> The review said climate change would bring changes in 
temperature, sea levels, rainfall, humidity and winds.</p><p> This would lead to an increase in death rates from 
heatwaves, infectious diseases, allergies, cholera as well as 
starvation due to failing crops.</p><p> They said climate change may already have led to lower 
production of food in some regions due to changes in 
temperature, rainfall, soil moisture, pests and diseases.</p><p> "In food insecure populations this alteration may already 
be contributing to malnutrition," it said.</p><p> The scientists said sea levels had risen in recent decades, 
and people had already started moving from some low-lying 
Pacific islands. Such population movements often increased 
nutritional and physical problems and disease, they said.</p><p> "The number of people adversely affected by El Nino-related 
weather events over three decades, worldwide, appears to have 
increased greatly," it said, referring to the weather pattern 
caused by warming of the Pacific Ocean off South America.</p><p> The review called for research to identify groups 
vulnerable to climate change and said health concerns should be 
included in international policy debates about global warming.</p>
<p> "Recognition of widespread health risks should widen these 
debates beyond the already important considerations of economic 
disruption," they said.
