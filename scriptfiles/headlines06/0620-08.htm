Ehren Watada has picked up the public endorsement of a retired Army colonel and diplomat who also contends the war there is illegal.</p>
<p>Speaking at University Lutheran Church in Seattle, retired Col. Ann Wright said Monday night that the artillery-targeting officer has the right to disobey "illegal orders." </p>

        <!--/endimage/-->Under principles established during the Nuremberg trials after World War II, she noted, people have an obligation to oppose a government that is conducting a war of aggression. </p>
<p>"The country of Iraq did nothing to the United States of America," said Wright, who resigned from the U.S. Foreign Service in 2003 because of the war.</p>
<p>At the church, Watada sat next to his parents, who flew in from Hawaii to support him. When the day comes for his unit to go to Iraq, he said he will report for duty. But he said he will not board the airplane.</p>

<p>"I have no regrets in the decision that I have made," he said in a calm voice.</p>
<p>While he does not expect to be arrested that day, he said he knows charges will be issued. He said he has told his commanders he will not make the day a media event.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Watada's case became public and became a cause for  anti-war protesters nationwide.</p>
<p>While Watada, 28, has said he is not a conscientious objector and that he would serve in Afghanistan, he focused on the war in Iraq in his Monday comments. </p>
<p>He is an Army 1st lieutenant and the first commissioned officer to publicly say he will not go to Iraq. Because of his public comments, he is under an administrative investigation by the Army.</p>
<p>His parents, Robert Watada and Carolyn Ho, appeared by his side to support him in Seattle Monday, and are staying near their son, especially since his deployment orders might come soon.</p>
<p>Ho said her son, a member of the 3rd Brigade, 2nd Infantry Division, faces a potential court-martial, imprisonment and possibly hard labor.</p>
<p>"What we're dealing with is the now," she said earlier in the day. "We're looking at what we can do at mobilizing and galvanizing the movement (to support him)."</p>
<p>On June 27, war resistance groups will hold protests as a "National Day of Action" to back him.</p>

<p>Robert Watada, a Vietnam War opponent, said his son decided on his own to request leaving the Army and to protest being sent to Iraq.</p>
<p>"We are very proud of him," said Robert Watada. "Contrary to what people think, that he is a traitor, he took an oath to defend the Constitution of the United States. That's what he's doing."</p>
<p>But there are costs. While some in the military support him, Ehren Watada said he has received hate messages via e-mail and indirect hostility from fellow Fort Lewis soldiers.</p>
<p>"It's not easy to stand up," said Wright. "Having been in the military for 29 years, I know the pressures that Lt. Watada is under. It is a difficult thing to go against the organization."</p>
<p>Said Robert Watada: "He has chosen the hard course, but it is the right course."</p>
<p>But when the day comes when Ehren Watada must say goodbye to his fellow soldiers, he knows what he will say.</p>
<p>"I will say, 'Good luck to all of you and come back home safe.' "</p>
