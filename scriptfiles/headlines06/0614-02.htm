Mr. Hall, a poet in the distinctive American tradition of Robert Frost, has also been a harsh critic of the religious right's influence on government arts policy. And as a member of the advisory council of the National Endowment for the Arts during the administration of George H. W. Bush, he referred to those he thought were interfering with arts grants as "bullies and art bashers." </p>
<p> He will succeed Ted Kooser, the Nebraskan who has been the poet laureate since 2004.</p>
<p> The announcement of Mr. Hall's appointment is to be made by James H. Billington, the Librarian of Congress. Mr. Billington said that he chose Mr. Hall because of "the sustained quality of his poetry, the reach and variety of things he talks about." Like Mr. Kooser, Mr. Billington said, Mr. Hall "evokes a sense of place." </p>

<p> Mr. Billington said that he was not aware of Mr. Hall's bluntness as a member of the national endowment's advisory council, but added that the laureates "are chosen for their poetry, not chosen to make a statement about anything else." </p>
<p> Mr. Hall, 77, lives in a white clapboard farmhouse in Wilmot, N.H., that has been in his family for generations. He said in a telephone interview that he didn't see the poet laureateship as a bully pulpit. "But it's a pulpit anyway," he said. "If I see First Amendment violations, I will speak up."</p>
<p> As for the rest of the job, "I have a terrible miscellany of thoughts," he said.</p>
<p> The library deliberately avoids attaching specific duties to the post so that the poet can do his or her own writing. But in recent years holders of the title have used the platform to enlarge the presence of poetry in the culture. Mr. Hall said that he would like to follow in the tradition of Mr. Kooser and other laureates who have tried to expand poetry's reach. "I'd like to encourage NPR to pay more attention to poetry," he said, referring to public radio, "and the cable networks, with the possibility of HBO doing something."</p>
<p> As poet laureate, Mr. Kooser has had a syndicated weekly newspaper column sponsored jointly by the Poetry Foundation and the Library of Congress that is offered  free to newspapers around the country. The column includes a poem chosen by him, along with a commentary.</p>
<p> "If Ted Kooser doesn't continue with his column, I might pick it up," Mr. Hall said. But, "I would like to include more poetry of the 17th century." </p>

<p>Mr. Hall is an extremely productive writer who has published about  18 books of poetry, 20 books of prose and 12 children's books. He has won many awards, including a National Book Critics Circle Award in 1989 for "The One Day," a collection.</p>
<p>In recent years much of his poetry has been preoccupied with the death of his wife, the poet Jane Kenyon, in 1995. In "Without," he wrote about the period of her illness:</p>
<p><em>we lived in a small island stone nation<br />
without color under gray clouds and wind<br />
distant the unlimited ocean acute<br />
lymphoblastic leukemia without seagulls <br />
or palm trees without vegetation<br />
or animal life only barnacles and lead <br />
colored moss that darkened when months did.</em></p>

<p> The critic William Pritchard said that Mr. Hall "doesn't fit neatly into a category" as a poet. The poems about Ms. Kenyon are raw and direct, he said, adding that "Without," for instance, "has none of the formal organizing means poets make use of, yet, line by line, has a rhythmic force to it that saves it from flaccidity and formlessness." </p>
<p> Nonetheless, Mr. Pritchard noted, one of Mr. Hall's best-known poems, "Baseball," is structured like the nine-inning game and written in a highly formal style, carefully comprising nine sections of nine verses each, with each verse having nine lines. Mr. Hall says in the poem: </p>
<p><em>Well, there are nine players on a baseball team, so to speak, and <br>
there are nine innings, with trivial<br>
exceptions like extra-inning games<br>
and games shortened by rain or darkness,<br>
by riot, hurricane, earthquake...</em></p>
<p>Robert Pinsky, who was poet laureate from 1997 to 2000, said he welcomed Mr. Hall's appointment, especially in light of his previous outspokenness about politics and the arts. "There is something nicely symbolic, and maybe surprising," Mr. Pinsky said, "that they have selected someone who has taken a stand for freedom."</p>

<p> The position  carries an award of $35,000 and a $5,000 travel allowance. It usually lasts a year, though poets are sometimes reappointed.</p>
