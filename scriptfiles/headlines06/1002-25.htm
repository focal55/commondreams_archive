<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->If there's one thing that's been conspicuously absent from the headlines recently, with the Congressional mid-term elections just weeks away, it's been the war in Iraq. That's because this mid-term election won't change much on the ground there, where tens of thousands of troops are hunkered down in military bases while the country around them burns.<br />
<br />
Now would be as good a time as any for students to bring the war in Iraq home.<br />

<br />
So long as the commander in chief continues to try to sell his tired war rhetoric, American forces will remain paralyzed in the quagmire of Iraq. Congress hasn't shown much leadership on the issue ever since it notarized the president's blank check to do what he wanted with the U.S. military. Aside from a few select cases where the war is a tangible issue, these November mid-terms will assure that things remain the same in the region. Without much mobilization of dissent, this should come as little surprise.<br />
<br />
The sad but fortunate fact is that this war of choice affects very few Americans. Until conscription kicks in and a draft is necessary to fill the armed forces, or the economy takes a nose-dive from high gas prices - neither of which case are highly likely to occur in the next few years - the only exposure many Americans will have to Iraq is through the media, which has trouble even functioning in the chaos of Iraq. It's all too easy to turn our heads away in comfort, ignoring the slide into America's next Vietnam.<br />
<br />
But this war is devastatingly affecting the citizens of Iraq, more than 500,000 of whom have been displaced since April 2003. Our continuing occupation is spawning a terible human rights crisis.<br />
<br />
War puppeteers, like our own cowboy in the White House, always create hierarchies of expendability. The brass in Washington courageous enough to stand on a bank of computers and order men into battle, as Stephen Colbert has so eloquently put it, have taken the course of letting the ragtag Iraqi security forces do as much fighting as possible to minimize American casualties.<br />
<br />
These Iraqis have kept American casualties under 100 per month since last August, but Iraqi civilians are dying faster than Baghdad morgues can keep up with. Last month alone, a Sept. 11 of more than 3,000 civilians were killed in Iraq. Sixty-eight American troops were killed behind the headlines.<br />
<br />
The lunacy in this entire endeavour, indeed any war, revolves around assigning expendability to any human being. But since our leaders in Washington have decided to stick their heads in the sand, it's up to the silent majority of Americans who assign dignity to every human to end the silence and demand this occupation end.<br />

<br />
There may be comfort in silence, but there is not progress. It's time students embrace louder nonviolent protest to bring the war in Iraq home, before the economic, moral and diplomatic tab the U.S. continues to run up in Mesopotamia threatens more future harm on our country and the world.
