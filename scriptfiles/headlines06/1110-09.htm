 Tom Andrews, national director of the Win Without War coalition made the appeal said in a statement following the Democrats' victories in the midterm congressional elections Tuesday.</p><p>
  "American voters have done their job, now it's time for Congress to do theirs," Andrews said. "The message couldn't be clearer. It's time to start the orderly withdrawal of American troops from Iraq. Our eyes are on the new Congress."</p><p>
  "American voters did their job on Tuesday by delivering a clear and powerful mandate to the new Congress: Change course in Iraq!" he said. "Now, it is time for the new Congress to do the job they were elected to do and bring this disaster to an end. We are pleased to see that (U.S. Defense Secretary Donald) Rumsfeld has stepped down, but the issues are policies not personalities.  </p><p>

  Andrews said his group was urging the new congressional leadership in the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives to "demand that the Bush administration present to Congress and the American people a plan for the strategic and orderly withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq."</p><p>
   The new 110th Congress also should "pass legislation ... that requires the administration to initiate the orderly withdrawal of American troops from Iraq, to be completed within a year."</p><p>
  Andrews said his group also wanted the new Congress to "initiate a comprehensive and honest accounting of what led our nation into this catastrophic war and the fundamental changes that will be required to meet our national security needs."  </p><p>
  "By large margins, American voters cited the failed war in Iraq as the single most important reason why they voted for change on Election Day.  It is time for that change to begin," he said.
