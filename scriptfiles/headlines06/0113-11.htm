<p> A bitter dispute over the planned military flyover at Monday's Martin Luther King march has split peace activists, longtime march supporters and East Side community members, and could result in a smaller turnout for what has been the nation's largest MLK march.</p>
<p>Some opponents of the flyover are calling for a boycott of the march,        while others plan to attend with bandanas over their mouths and black        and yellow ribbons around their arms in a show of protest. </p>
<p>       Two fighter jets from the 99th Flying Training Squadron at Randolph AFB        will zoom over Pittman-Sullivan Park at noon at the end of the nearly        three-mile march from Martin Luther King Drive to Iowa Street.     </p>     <p>       While some say the flyover will provide a patriotic flair to the march        during a time of war, others say it will represent support for the war &#8212;        something King would not approve of.     </p>     <p>       The Rev. Herman Price, chairman of the city's MLK Commission, said the        flyover was meant to honor King, and he is dismayed by the divisiveness        it has caused.     </p>     <p>       &quot;It all depends on how you look at it,&quot; Price said Thursday. &quot;They say        the planes represent war and bombs and death, but at the same time those        planes can also represent our freedom and peace.&quot;     </p>     <p>       But City Councilwoman Patti Radle, who objected to the flyover in a        letter to the editor in Wednesday's Express-News, doesn't see it that        way.     </p>     <p>       &quot;War is a different system working for peace. Martin Luther King was not        part of that system,&quot; she said.     </p>     <p>       City Councilwoman Sheila McNeil, whose district includes the march        route, contented the flyover is exactly what King would have wanted.     </p>     <p>       &quot;I think that the military plays too significant of a role in our        community for us to ignore them and not include them in this march,&quot; she        said. &quot;They are the reason why we have peace, and this is MLK's peace        march.&quot;     </p>     <p>       The dispute has been brewing since November, when someone brought up the        idea for a flyover at an MLK Commission meeting. Commissioners voted for        a motion to add the flyover, though it's unclear whether the issue was        placed on the agenda.     </p>     <p>       As word of the flyover spread throughout the community, some peace        activists became upset and banded together through e-mails and meetings.     </p>     <p>       Many opponents of the flyover, including Radle, said they might skip the        event.     </p>     <p>       A flier distributed at City Hall on Thursday urged people to boycott the        march.     </p>     <p>       &quot;San Antonio's MLK march, one of the largest in the nation, is        absolutely the wrong event for a military flyover,&quot; P.C. McKinnon wrote        in an e-mail to the Express-News. &quot;Would it have been appropriate to        have a flyover at Dr. King's funeral? I think not.&quot;     </p>     <p>       McKinnon said he won't take his family to the march.     </p>     <p>       Tommy Calvert Jr., an East Side activist, said when he tried to rescind        the flyover decision at an MLK commission meeting Monday, Price would        not allow it.     </p>     <p>       &quot;I think I'm going to wear a gag bandana in my mouth since I was not        allowed to call a vote on the floor in solidarity with the dozens of        people who were there to overturn the vote,&quot; Calvert said. &quot;If you're        going to honor Dr. King, you have to honor the nonviolent point. It's        fundamental.&quot;     </p>     <p>       He added that no one in the peace movement wants to keep the military        from marching.     </p>     <p>       &quot;But a fighter jet is not a soldier,&quot; he said. &quot;Dr. King said that you        lay down your arms at the table of brotherhood. A fighter jet is an arm.&quot;      </p>     <p>       Jane Tuck, who attended the meeting with Calvert, said she told the        group the flyover would be antithetical to the beliefs of King and his        work.     </p>     <p>       Others joined in, and the meeting soon turned sour.     </p>     
<p>       &quot;It got to be a very ugly meeting,&quot; said Tuck, a member of a pacifist        organization.</p>
