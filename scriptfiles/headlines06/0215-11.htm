A TV frame grab shows an image made available by Australia's Special Broadcasting Service (SBS) on February 15, 2006, of what the broadcaster says is a detainee (L) in Iraq's Abu Ghraib prison taken in 2003. SBS, which aired the images on its 'Dateline' programme on Wednesday, said they were taken at the same time as the photographs of US soldiers abusing Iraqi prisoners inside Abu Ghraib.<br>

More photographs have been leaked of Iraqi citizens tortured by
US soldiers at the notorious Abu Ghraib prison on the outskirts of
Baghdad.
<p>Tonight the SBS <i>Dateline</i> program plans to broadcast about
60 previously unpublished photographs that the US Government has
been fighting to keep secret in a court case with the American
Civil Liberties Union.</p>
<p>
Although a US judge last year granted the union access to the
photographs following a freedom-of-information request, the US
Administration has appealed against the decision on the grounds
their release would fuel anti-American sentiment.</p>
<p>Some of the photos are similar to those published in 2004,
others are different. They include photographs of six corpses,
although the circumstances of their deaths are not clear. There are
also pictures of what appear to be burns and wounds from shotgun
pellets.</p>
<P>The executive producer of <i>Dateline</i>, Mike Carey, said he
was showing the pictures leaked to his program because it was
important people understood what had happened at Abu Ghraib.</p>

batch of Abu Ghraib photographs in April 2004.</p>
<p>Mr Carey said he could not explain why the photographs had not
yet been published, as he thought it was likely that some
journalists had them.</p>

<p>"It think it's strange, maybe they think its more of the
same."</p>
