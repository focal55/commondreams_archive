<p>President Gen Pervez Musharraf of Pakistan has now accused President Hamid Karzai of being "oblivious to events" in his own country and passing on "nonsense" intelligence.

<p>A dossier Afghan officials gave to Islamabad on Taliban militants allegedly in Pakistan, including the regime's fugitive leader Mullah Omar, was "nonsense", Gen Musharraf said.

<p>"There is a very, very deliberate attempt to malign Pakistan by some (Afghani) agents, and President Karzai is totally oblivious of what is happening in his own country," Gen Musharraf said.

<p>Afghanistan's foreign minister, Abdullah Abdullah, complained last week that Islamabad was not following up on the list, handed over when Mr Karzai visited Pakistan last month.

<p>The row has escalated steadily since Kabul first accused Islamabad of turning a blind eye to Taliban training facilities on Pakistani soil.

<p>It also alleged that some circles in Pakistan support and finance Islamic radicals behind the insurgency in Afghanistan.

<p>But Gen Musharraf angrily rebuffed the charges, saying he was "totally disappointed" by the intelligence the Afghans had provided.

<p>"We've already gone through it, this list," he said. "Two thirds of it is months old, and there is nothing."

<p>During his visit last weekend Mr Bush thanked Pakistan for its help on the war on terror but said more could be done to "bring terrorists to justice".

<p>Yesterday it was Pakistan's turn to blame Afghanistan. A senior military spokesman said terrorists streaming over from the Afghan side of the border were behind the fighting in North Waziristan.

<p>Pro-Taliban and government forces have clashed in the region for three days and left nearly 120 fighters dead. In some of the region's heaviest fighting since the army entered the semi-autonomous tribal areas in 2003, helicopter gunships pounded pockets of resistance manned by tribal militias loyal to the Taliban and al-Qa'eda.

<p>Residents of Miran Shah, where the army has imposed a curfew, said that some 1,000 families had fled after rocket and artillery clashes. The number of civilian casualties is unknown.

<p>"We are establishing the government's writ," said a military spokesman, Maj Gen Shaukat Sultan.

<p>Pakistani forces using helicopter gunships yesterday tackled the remaining sporadic resistance by militants, the military said.

<p>The clashes were the most violent in the tribal belt since the Taliban regime in neighbouring Afghanistan fell in late 2001 and many fighters fled across the border.

<p>"According to latest information, the death toll in Saturday's fighting has gone up to 100. This is in addition to the 19 killed this morning in Miran Shah," said Maj Gen Sultan.

<p>He had earlier said that 19 militants, including foreigners, died yesterday when troops tried to take control of a telephone exchange in Miran Shah.
