<p>BANGKOK - When United States negotiators fly into Thailand 
to thrash out a bilateral free trade deal, next week, they will be 
greeted with  jeers rather than this country's famed smile of welcome.
 <p>
							  
Activists opposed to the free trade agreement (FTA) view the sixth 
round of talks in the northern city of Chiang Mai from Jan. 9-13 as a 
defining moment, and in a bid to raise the ante will bring 10,000 people 
on to the streets to protest against the talks.

The U.S. wants to enforce a 25-year period to protect patents for drugs 
as against the 20-year patent protection that is the case under the 
existing global free trade rules.

''Thailand stands to lose much if the FTA with the U.S. is signed,'' 
Saree Ongsamwong, general secretary of the Foundation for Consumers, a 
non-governmental organization (NGO), said in an interview. ''It will 
increase poverty among the small farmers in the provinces.''
<p>
Street protests are the only avenue open for opponents of the FTA, 
since the Thai government has shrouded its policies in secrecy, adds 
Saree, whose group belongs to a nationwide coalition of anti-FTA NGOs, 
called FTW Watch. ''There has been no public debate and the government 
has refused to listen to our concerns.''
<p>
Some of these worries are with reason, given that Thai farmers took a 
beating following similar bilateral trade deals that the government of 
Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra signed with China, Australia and New 
Zealand.
<p>
Cheaper imports of garlic and onions from China have put 40 percent of 
Thai farmers out of business, Witoon Lianchumroon, coordinator of FTA 
Watch, told reporters on Thursday. ''About 50,000 farming households 
have been affected.''
<p>

Likewise, an estimated 100,000 Thai farmers who raised cattle for meat 
have been unable to compete against cheaper imports from New Zealand 
that followed the Thai-New Zealand FTA agreement.
<p>
Witoon estimates that nearly 6.5 million farmers will be affected if 
Bangkok signs a similar trade deal with Washington, resulting in U.S. 
agriculture products flooding the local markets.
<p>
Thai farmers make up a substantial slice of this South-east Asian 
country's labor force - some 60 percent of the country's 65 million 
people - yet they remain among the lowest wage earners. The average 
monthly income for the agriculture sector workers hovers between 2,500 
baht (62.50 U.S. dollars) to 3,000 baht (75 dollars).
<p>
Bangkok, however, appears unfazed by such objections as it talks of the 
FTA with the United States being ready for implementation in a few 
months. ''Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra and U.S. President George 
Bush earlier indicated that their intention to wrap up the deal by this 
spring,'' an English language daily, 'The Nation,' reported Thursday.
<p>
The value of two-way trade between the two countries was estimated at 
over 21 billion US dollars in 2003, with Thailand enjoying an edge.
<p>
Proposed changes would not only mean a possible loss in income for Thais 
farmers but also possible loss of lives among Thais living with HIV/AIDS 
who depend on cheap, locally-produced generic anti-AIDS drugs.
<p>
''The government's policy to provide cheap drugs for people with AIDS 
will be threatened with this FTA,'' says Kamol Uppakaew, chairman of the 
Thai Network of People Living with HIV/AIDS. ''Those who need the new 
line of drugs will not be able to get it because the price will be too 
high, 20,000 baht (500 dollars) per month.''
<p>
His concerns will be put to test during the talks in Chiang Mai, since 
discussions over intellectual property rights are expected to feature 
for 
the first time. Other issues to be taken up include opening up of the 
financial services sector and the lucrative telecommunication industry.
<p>
Currently, the Thai government's universal health care program 
supplies 
generic anti-AIDS drugs to nearly 100,000 people who need medication. In 
all, there are some 670,000 people with HIV in this country, where over 
300,000 people have died from AIDS-related causes since the pandemic was 
first detected in the 1980s.

<p>
According to the activists, the planned FTA with the U.S. would make it 
difficult for the state-run pharmaceutical agency to produce the 
new line of anti-AIDS drugs because of the position Washington is taking 
over intellectual property rights.
<p>
The U.S. wants to enforce a 25-year period to protect patents for drugs 
as against the 20-year patent protection that is the case under the 
existing global free trade rules.
<p>
''This agreement is like putting people on an express train heading 
towards a disaster,'' says Witoon. ''Even Thai academics are against it. 
Over 80 of them are calling the government to stop the FTA talks.''
