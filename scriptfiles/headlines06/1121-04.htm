<p>
Mines Action Canada is urging the federal government to take a leading role in international efforts to ban the weapons, which the group says kill and main civilians every day around the world.


</p>
<p>
Cluster munitions come as bombs or artillery shells. They spray dozens or even hundreds of deadly armour-piercing bomblets across a target. Those that don't explode can sit for years waiting to kill or maim unsuspecting civilians.

</p>
<p>
In effect, said Paul Hannon, executive director of the group, the dud bomblets become a minefield.

</p>
<p>
The weapons are inaccurate, he said, because they are scattered over a wide area and because anywhere from five to 30 per cent of the bomblets don't explode on impact, posing a lethal threat long after the conflict is over.

</p>
<p>
Hannon said Israel and Hezbollah both used cluster munitions during the conflict in Lebanon last summer and the duds are still killing and wounding civilians.

</p>
<p>
Habbouba Aoun of the Landmine Resource Centre in Beirut said it's a terrible legacy.

</p>
<p>

"In Lebanon, it will take us an unknown number of years to alleviate the burden resulting from the over one million lethal cluster-munition 'duds' found in fields of tobacco and olives, gardens, roofs of houses and roads," she said.

</p>
<p>
An international conference in Geneva earlier this month agreed only to keep talking about the issue, although Norway has offered to lead a separate effort to control or ban the weapons.

</p>
<p>
Norwegian Foreign Minister Jonas Gahr Store said the world needs concrete measures "that will put an end to the untold human suffering caused by cluster munitions."

</p>
<p>
"We are pleased to note the increasing calls for an international ban," he added. "Norway is ready to work closely with others to establish such a ban."

</p>
<p>
Hannon said the Norwegian effort follows the path pioneered by the Canadian government in the 1990s, when it sidestepped deadlocked international bodies to negotiate the Ottawa treaty, which banned anti-personnel mines. 

</p>
<p>
Officially, Canada prefers to keep working with a UN group known as the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons, which wound up its latest meeting in Geneva last week.

</p>

<p>
At Geneva, Canadian delegate Earl Turcotte, spoke only of the need to continue talks.

</p>
<p>
"Canada would be pleased to participate in constructive discussion of cluster munitions and other such weapons," he told the conference.

</p>
<p>
Hannon said the Canadian military has disposed of its older Rockeye cluster bombs, notorious for the number of dud bomblets they produced, but still maintains a small stockpile of artillery shells that hold bomblets. The Forces have never used cluster weapons, he said.

</p>
<p>
Activists met Foreign Affairs Minister Peter MacKay before the Geneva conference and Hannon said the minister expressed interest in taking further steps.

</p>
<p>
"We interpreted our meeting with him as an indication that he was willing to make this a priority of the government and move this forward," Hannon said.

</p>
<p>
Dan Dugas, a spokesman for MacKay, said the minister is ready to look at the whole issue.


</p>
<p>
"The minister is prepared to engage in focused discussions on cluster munitions - he wants to limit the needless suffering of civilians in conflicts.

</p>
<p>
"Canada will review the results of the conference and will also consider other countries' initiatives to figure out the best approach to be taken."

</p>
<p>
Hannon said activists have been pressing governments to act since 2000.

</p>
<p>
"The previous government did not," he said. "We were hoping that our new government would take action on this.

</p>
<p>
"We think it's consistent with what they have said about increasing Canada's role on the international stage, particularly in the areas of diplomacy and development."
