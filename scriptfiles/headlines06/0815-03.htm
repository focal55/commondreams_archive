Car bombs and a rocket barrage struck a predominantly Shiite neighborhood in Baghdad Sunday killing at least 62 people and injuring 140, a municipal official said Monday. The rockets were apparently fired from a mostly Sunni district targeted by U.S. troops in a crackdown against the sectarian violence roiling the capital. Some 300 US troops are being sent back to Iraq from Alaska to rejoin an army brigade whose tour of duty was extended by four months to quell sectarian violence in Baghdad, army officials said.

The soldiers are part of the 3,900-strong 172nd Stryker
Brigade Combat Team from Fort Wainwright in Alaska. Facing
rising sectarian violence in Baghdad, Defense Secretary Donald
Rumsfeld on July 27 ordered the unit to remain in Iraq for up
to four months past its scheduled departure.</p>
<p>That order provoked anger and disappointment among some of
the soldiers' families in Alaska. It also made clear that any
significant reduction in the 135,000-strong U.S. force in Iraq
was unlikely in the immediate future.</p>
<p>The brigade was so far along in the process of flowing out
of Iraq after its yearlong tour that 378 soldiers had returned
home to Alaska and about 300 had arrived in Kuwait en route
home, the Army said.</p>
<p>All of the soldiers who had reached Kuwait were sent back
to Iraq, the Army said. Now, 301 of the 378 who made it to
Alaska will be sent back to Iraq in roughly a week, with the
remainder allowed to remain home, said Maj. Gen. Charles
Jacoby, head of Army forces in Alaska.</p>
<p>"Of course, this comes as a huge disappointment to the
families and perhaps a greater disappointment to kids that were
really expecting dads and moms home," Jacoby told reporters.</p>
<p>But Jacoby said the brigade, which uses the Stryker wheeled
armored vehicle, needed the soldiers, mainly infantrymen, back
in Iraq to "reassemble a proven team."</p>
<p>"From a tactical and military standpoint, this makes all
the sense in the world," Jacoby said.</p>
<p>Most of the soldiers returned to Alaska three weeks ago but
some have been back for as long as five weeks, said Paul Boyce,
an Army spokesman at the Pentagon.</p>

<p>Mary Cheney, a soldier's wife who gave birth to her fourth
child just weeks ago, said at a briefing in Alaska arranged by
the Army: "Am I happy about him being gone? No. But I accept
what he's doing."</p>
<p>Pentagon policy is for Army units to serve 12-month tours
in Iraq and Marine Corps units to serve seven-month tours. Army
soldiers kept longer than one year in Iraq get an extra &#36;1,000
in pay per month, the Army said.</p>
<p>The 172nd had operated primarily in the Mosul area in
relatively calm northern Iraq, but is being shifted into
Baghdad, the site of unrelenting violence despite attempts at a
security crackdown by U.S. and Iraqi government forces.</p>
<p>The brigade now is due to return to Alaska starting in late
November through early January, officials said.</p>
<p>After some troops and families complained earlier in the
war about lack of predictability in the length of tours in
Iraq, the Pentagon instituted the rules on deployment duration.
This was intended to reduce emotional stress for troops serving
in a hostile and unpredictable environment.
