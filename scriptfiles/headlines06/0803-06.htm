<p>WASHINGTON - The top auditor of the US reconstruction effort in Iraq yesterday detailed a series of failures, including a $218.5 million emergency radio network that doesn't work, a hospital  that is  turning out to be twice as expensive as planned,   an oil pipeline that is spewing lakes of crude oil onto the ground, and a prison that was meant to hold 4,400 inmates   but can house only about 800.</p>
<p>Stuart Bowen Jr. , the special inspector general for Iraq reconstruction, cited multiple causes for the failures at a Senate hearing yesterday, among them the growth of the Iraqi insurgency, poor planning by the US government, and corruption in the Iraqi government.</p>

<p>But he also took aim at the ``cost-plus" contracts given to American construction firms -- including Bechtel,  part of the consortium   that oversaw Boston's Big Dig -- which guaranteed profits on top of the cost of the project, even with huge overruns.</p>
<p>``The use of a cost-plus contract means that the taxpayer pays for everything, success and failures," Bowen told the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs. He added that such contracts were too costly and inefficient, and should not have been used in Iraq. ``Most projects were small in Iraq and could have been executed through fixed-price contracting," he said.</p>
<p>Bowen warned that the United States will have to make major changes in its planning and oversight of the rebuilding effort if it is to successfully hand over billions of dollars worth of infrastructure to the Iraqi government, as the US government has said it will.</p>
<p>Numerous problems were detailed in a series of audits and inspection reports by Bowen's office. Some -- like the overruns at the hospital in Basra -- have been previously reported. Others -- including the flawed emergency-response network -- were discussed for the first time yesterday.</p>
<p>Congress appropriated more than $18.6 billion to the Iraqi rebuilding effort. More than $14 billion has been spent. The remainder must be devoted to specific projects by the end of next month, or will revert to the US treasury.</p>
<p>Bowen said massive investments in Iraq's power plants, railroads, and sewage facilities have brought some progress to the country, but that more needed to be done to ensure that Iraqis can maintain the plants and infrastructure after the United States turns them over. He specifically cited the $218.5 million emergency radio network as a ``cautionary tale" of poor planning.</p>
<p>The Advanced First Response Network was meant to be a state-of-the-art service connecting Iraqi police, firefighters, and emergency medical personnel through a network of 30,000 radios -- which is  desperately needed in  Iraq.</p>
<p>The system was handed over to Iraq's government in June, but Bowen said it ``is not working."</p>
<p>An audit pointed out  that Iraqis had not budgeted the $16.7 million needed to operate the system. It also said that many of the radios could not be accounted for, and that there were ``insufficient numbers of trained personnel to fully staff and operate" the network's nine dispatch centers.</p>

<p>The system itself had fundamental flaws that were detailed in the audit: Iraq's fiber optic infrastructure can't support such a system. It also can't operate during the frequent power blackouts. As a result of other technical flaws in the system, Iraqi citizens can't use their cellphones or home phones to call for help at seven of the nine dispatch centers.</p>
<p>In the case of the Basra Children's Hospital, Bowen told senators that poor oversight and the use of a ``cost-plus contract" could be blamed for construction delays and overruns. Bechtel was supposed to be paid $50 million to build the hospital by December of 2005. But in March of this year, Bechtel informed the US Agency for International Development that the company would need until July  2007 to finish the project, and that the cost would rise to between $90 million and $131 million. Auditors have recommended that Bechtel be dropped from the project.</p>
<p>When Senator  Susan Collins, a Maine Republican, asked Bowen why the overruns had not been detected earlier, he said USAID had failed to provide enough details in its quarterly updates to Congress.</p>
<p>In another ``cost-plus" contract, a prison facility in Nasiriyah was supposed to be built for 4,400 inmates, but ultimately was downsized to just 800 beds. The contracting company Parsons -- not associated with the Big Dig contractor Parsons Brinckerhoff -- was taken off the job in June 2006, after falling behind schedule by 410 days and $23 million in cost overruns, an inspection report said. An Iraqi subcontractor took over the job, Bowen said, but Parsons was paid anyway.</p>
<p>That prompted Senator Carl Levin , a Michigan Democrat, to ask: ``Why did we tolerate this? Why did we spend $148 million for  one-third   of the work?"</p>
<p>Bowen said the ``cost-plus" contract guaranteed Parsons a profit, even if the project went awry.</p>
<p>When US ambassador Zalmay Khalilzad arrived in Iraq last year, he stopped issuing ``cost-plus" contracts and gave most jobs to Iraqi firms on  a  fixed-price basis. But much of the US reconstruction funding had already been spent.</p>
<p>There were problems with Iraqi firms, as well. An audit   cited the government-owned State Company for Oil Projects for failing to complete repairs on a pipeline in northern Iraq that crosses the Riyadh and Zegeton canals.</p>
<p>After more than two years of delays and millions  of dollars in   cost overruns, the crossings are still estimated to be only 10 percent complete, the audit said.</p>

<p>The threat of kidnappings slowed work on the site, the audit said. Iraqi subcontractors requested that no American be present to monitor it, apparently for fear of attack. Meanwhile, an old pipeline that the project was meant to replace has been spewing lakes of crude oil onto the Iraqi landscape, according to a series of aerial photographs included in Bowen's report to Congress.</p>
<p>Bowen said the United States needs to do more to help Iraqis root out rampant corruption in their oil and defense ministries.</p>
<p>``Corruption in Iraq is endemic -- we call it a pandemic," Bowen  told the senators. ``Our audit of the anticorruption effort in Iraq has found it wanting."</p>
<p>Bowen reported that one-third of Iraqis reported in a survey that they had paid bribes for products or services this year. But only $65 million has been spent on anticorruption efforts, less than  1 percent   of US reconstruction funding.</p>
<p>``Unless reforms are put in place, corruption may jeopardize the political stability of the new government," an audit stated.</p>
<p>Bowen also told senators that it is essential for international donors to step in and continue financing Iraq's infrastructure when US funds run out.</p>
<p>That hasn't happened yet, he said, noting that out of $13 billion pledged by non-US donors, less than $4 billion has been given.&nbsp;</p>
