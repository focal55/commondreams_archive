<p>Nuclear energy is not the panacea for tackling global warming,
says one of the world's most celebrated climate change campaigners,
former US vice-president Al Gore.

GORE: 'NUCLEAR IS NOT THE ANSWER'<br>

Mr Gore also shrugged off Prime Minister John Howard's recent
claim that his film <i>An Inconvenient Truth</i> showed "a degree
of the peeved politician".</p>
<p>"It may be one of those elements that's in the eyes of the
beholder," he told <i>The Age</i> yesterday.</p>

<p>Mr Gore said nuclear power was unlikely to play a significantly
bigger role in the climate change battle. "Even if you set aside
the problem of long-term waste storage and the danger of operator
accident and the vulnerability to terrorist attack, you still have
two others that are more difficult," he said.</p>
<p>The first problem was one of economics.</p>
<p>"Nuclear power plants are the costliest to build and they take
the longest time and at present they come in only one size &#151;
extra large."</p>
<p>The second was nuclear weapons proliferation. "For eight years
when I was in the White House, every problem of weapons
proliferation was connected to a reactor program," he said.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister has recently talked up the prospects of
nuclear power plants being built in Australia, arguing the country
could not afford to "sacrifice rational discussion on the altar of
anti-nuclear theology and political opportunism".</p>
<p>Next week an inquiry into nuclear power headed by former Telstra
chief executive Ziggy Switkowski is due to deliver its
findings.</p>
<p>Mr Gore said it was extremely important that Mr Howard had now
acknowledged the damage from carbon dioxide emissions.</p>
<p>"Let me say I want to be respectful of the Prime Minister's
change in rhetoric.</p>

<p>"It's not easy to do something like that and &#133; this
position might be a way station for him on the real road to
Damascus where he actually joins the world community," he said.</p>
<p>"And he may. I don't know, I can't look into his heart."</p>
<p>Mr Gore said that Australia and the US should sign the Kyoto
Protocol but he acknowledged that this presented Mr Howard and US
President George Bush with big political problems given that they
had previously "demonised" it.</p>
<p>Of Australia's promotion of a new global climate change pact he
said: "Obviously neither Australia nor the United States can write
its own little treaty and be separate from the rest of the
world."</p>
<p>But there was, he said, a third path: "To join the world
discussion now in Nairobi on how to strengthen Kyoto and how to
make whatever changes Prime Minister Howard wants to advocate and
join the rest of the world community. That's the test."</p>
<p>Mr Gore, now chairman of investment firm Generation Investment
Management, yesterday met with Premier Steve Bracks and his deputy
John Thwaites. He described Victoria as forward thinking on climate
change and said he would take a number of local initiatives back to
the United States.</p>
<p>He was particularly impressed with the Bracks Government's
"black balloons" advertising campaign, which links household energy
usage with the amount of carbon dioxide it releases into the
air.</p>
<p>"I'm going to take that ad back and show it to some folks there,
maybe put it on YouTube," he said.</p>
