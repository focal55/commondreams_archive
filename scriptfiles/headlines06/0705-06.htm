Three of the Americans were alleged CIA agents and the fourth worked at the U.S. military air base in Aviano, northern Italy, a statement from the Milan prosecutor's office said.</p><p>It said Marco Mancini, director of a division of the Sismi military intelligence agency, and another Sismi official, had been arrested.</p><p>The new arrests and the warrants relate to the abduction of Hassan Mustafa Osama Nasr, also known as Abu Omar. He says he was seized on a Milan street in broad daylight, bundled into a van and driven to Aviano.</p><p>He says he was then flown to Egypt and tortured under questioning.</p><p>An Italian court has already issued arrest warrants for 22 suspected U.S. agents over the abduction.</p><p>But it was the first time Italian officials have been linked to the investigation.</p><p>If an Italian role is confirmed, it would lend evidence to allegations that European countries colluded with the United States in the secret "renditions" of terrorism suspects.</p><p>Lawmakers in Italy's new centre-left ruling coalition accused former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi of a cover-up during his five-year administration, which ended in April.</p><p>Berlusconi has fiercely denied that his administration or Sismi were involved in the kidnapping -- and even once summoned the U.S. ambassador to request Italian sovereignty be respected.</p><p>AL QAEDA, IRAQ</p><p>"Mancini's arrest confirms what we've said for a long time -- that is, that the previous government knew about Sismi's involvement in Abu Omar's kidnapping by the CIA," said Giovanni Russo Spena, a Senator with the Communist Refoundation party in the ruling coalition.</p><p>Italian investigators had been wiretapping Nasr before his abduction and accuse him of having ties to al Qaeda and recruiting combatants for Iraq, according to court documents.</p><p>They say the kidnapping broke Italian law and ruined a promising investigation.</p><p>Mancini was accused of collaborating in the kidnap, judicial sources said earlier on Wednesday.</p><p>The European Union's Justice Commissioner Franco Frattini said he respected the prosecutor's decision to arrest Mancini.</p><p>"The prosecutor is investigating, he is accusing this officer of the Italian secret service, we'll see whether he is responsible or not," he told Reuters in a telephone interview.</p><p>The Abu Omar case is one of the best known examples of alleged CIA secret operations in the U.S.-led "war on terror".</p><p>Human rights groups condemn "extraordinary rendition", saying suspects have frequently been sent by the United States to countries that practice torture.</p><p>Washington acknowledges making secret "rendition" transfers of terrorism suspects between countries, but denies either using torture itself against suspects or handing them over to countries that do so.</p>
