<p>DENVER -</b>You could be on a secret government database or watch list for simply taking a picture on an airplane.  Some federal air marshals say they're reporting your actions to meet a quota, even though some top officials deny it.<p></p>The air marshals, whose identities are being concealed, told 7NEWS that they're required to submit at least one report a month. If they don't, there's no raise, no bonus, no awards and no special assignments.<p></p>"Innocent passengers are being entered into an international intelligence database as suspicious persons, acting in a suspicious manner on an aircraft ... and they did nothing wrong," said one federal air marshal.
These unknowing passengers who are doing nothing wrong are landing in a secret government document called a Surveillance Detection Report, or SDR.  Air marshals told 7NEWS that managers in Las Vegas created and continue to maintain this potentially dangerous quota system.<p></p>"Do these reports have real life impacts on the people who are identified as potential terrorists?" 7NEWS Investigator Tony Kovaleski asked.<p></p>"Absolutely," a federal air marshal replied.<p></p>7NEWS obtained an internal Homeland Security document defining an SDR as a report designed to identify terrorist surveillance activity.<p></p>"When you see a decision like this, for these reports, who loses here?" Kovaleski asked.<p></p>"The people we're supposed to protect -- the American public," an air marshal said.<p></p>What kind of impact would it have for a flying individual to be named in an SDR?<p></p>"That could have serious impact ... They could be placed on a watch list. They could wind up on databases that identify them as potential terrorists or a threat to an aircraft. It could be very serious," said Don Strange, a former agent in charge of air marshals in Atlanta. He lost his job attempting to change policies inside the agency.<p></p>That's why several air marshals object to a July 2004 memo from top management in the Las Vegas office,  a memo that reminded air marshals of the SDR requirement.<p></p>The body of the memo said, "Each federal air marshal is now expected to generate at least one SDR per month."<p></p>"Does that memo read to you that Federal Air Marshal headquarters has set a quota on these reports?" Kovaleski asked.<p></p>"Absolutely, no doubt," an air marshal replied.<p></p>A second management memo, also dated July 2004, said, "There may come an occasion when you just don't see anything out of the ordinary for a month at a time, but I'm sure that if you are looking for it, you'll see something."<p></p>Another federal air marshal said that not only is there a quota in Las Vegas for SDRs, but that  "it  directly reflects on (their) performance evaluations" and on how much money they make.<p></p>The director of the Air Marshal Service, Dana Brown, declined 7NEWS' request for an interview on the quota system. But the agency points to a memo from August 2004 that said there is not a quota for submitting SDRs and which goes on to say, "I do not expect reports that are inaccurate or frivolous."<p></p>But, Las Vegas-based air marshals say the quota system remains in force, now more than two years after managers sent the original memos, and that it's a mandate from management that impacts annual raises, bonuses, awards and special assignments.<p></p>"To meet this quota, to get their raises, do you think federal air marshals in Las Vegas are making some of this stuff up?" Kovaleski asked.<p></p>"I know they are. It's a joke," an air marshal replied.<p></p>"Have marshals in the Las Vegas office, I don't want to say fabricated, but 'created' reports?" Kovaleski asked.<p></p>"Creative writing --  stretching a long ways the truth, yes," an air marshal replied.<p></p>One example, according to air marshals, occurred on one flight leaving Las Vegas, when  an unknowing passenger, most likely a tourist, was identified in an SDR for doing nothing more than taking a photo of the Las Vegas skyline as his plane rolled down the runway.<p></p>"You're saying that was not an accurate portrayal of a potential terrorist activity?" Kovaleski asked.<p></p>"No, it was not," an air marshal said.<p></p>"It was a marshal trying to meet a quota ..." Kovaleski said.<p></p>"Yes, he was," the air marshal replied.<p></p>Strange said he didn't have a quota in the Atlanta office when he was in charge.<p></p>"I would never have done that ... You are going to have people reporting every suspicious looking activity they come across, whether they in their heart feel like it's a threat, just to meet the quota," Strange said.<p></p>Strange and other air marshals said the quota allows the government to fill a database with bad information.<p></p>A Las Vegas air marshal said he didn't write an SDR every month for exactly that reason.<p></p>"Well, it's intelligence information, and like any system, if you put garbage in, you get garbage out," the air marshal said.<p></p>"I would like to see an investigation -- a real investigation conducted into the ways things are done here," the air marshal in Las Vegas said.<p></p>Although the agency strongly denies any presence of a quota system, Las Vegas-based air marshals have produced documents that show their performance review is directly linked to producing  SDRs.
