<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><P>Earth's average temperature has been hotter over the last quarter century 
than during the previous four centuries and possibly much longer, the National 
Academy of Sciences said in a report Thursday that substantially supports the 
findings of a controversial 1998 climate study. 
<P>The report by a scientific panel appointed by the academy backed the most 
vivid feature of the so-called hockey stick graphic, a chart showing a 
long-term rise in temperature between A.D. 900 and today. 
<P>The panelists agreed that "the last few decades of the 20th century were 
warmer than any comparable period in the last 400 years." But they showed less 
confidence in the researchers' conclusion that the climate is warmer now than 
it has been in 1,000 years, a conjecture the scientists said was only 
scientifically plausible. More research is needed to investigate that 
possibility, the panelists said. 
<P>Even so, the 141-page report by a dozen prominent scientists who reviewed 
the latest scientific reports on global warming and heard testimony from 
climate experts could offer ammunition to those who are calling for tightened 
controls on greenhouse gases that many scientists believe may be causing global 
warming. The study was sparked by a 2005 congressional dispute over the 
reliability of the 1998 study and chart. 
<P>The chart got its name for its vague resemblance to a hockey stick, the 
shaft depicting temperature fluctuations over a long stretch of time until 
about the mid-19th century, when warming suddenly spiked into the form of a 
blade. 
<P>First published in Nature magazine, the study thrilled global warming 
activists and angered some congressional Republicans and oil-industry 
executives.  

<P>The work by climate scientist Michael Mann, then at the University of 
Virginia, and two colleagues depicted a soaring rise in the Earth's average 
temperature since about the beginning of the Industrial Age, compared to 
generally cooler global temperatures through most of the Middle Ages. 
<P>Reliable, widespread thermometer records weren't available before the 
mid-19th century. To infer temperature averages in different eras, the 
scientists based most of their chart on natural or proxy records such as the 
width of rings inside trees that grew during the Middle Ages, the ratios of 
oxygen isotopes in polar ice cores and centuries-old paintings of glaciers in 
locales that are now ice-free. 
<P>However, the methodology was not sufficient to persuade the panel to throw 
its full weight behind the most sweeping claim by Mann and his colleagues: that 
temperatures through the Middle Ages were generally much cooler than they are 
today. 
<P>The panel's use of the word "plausible" in judging the claim puzzled 
Raymond Bradley of the University of Massachusetts, who published the original 
study with Mann and Malcolm Hughes of the University of Arizona. In an e-mail, 
Bradley called the use of the word strange and speculated the panel chose it to 
strengthen consensus. "I guess it was selected so that everybody on the 
committee could agree," he said. 
<P>A more sardonic view was taken by prominent Bay Area physicist Richard 
Muller of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, who served as a peer reviewer 
for the academy's report. In 2004, he publicly criticized the Mann team's work, 
calling it "an artifact of poor mathematics ... when applied to the 
(temperature records of the) last millennium," he recalled in an e-mail 
Thursday.  
<P>Although Muller estimates 2 in 3 odds that humans are causing global 
warming, "the fact that the original conclusion of Mann et al. is 'plausible' 
is damning with faint praise," he said. "Theories are plausible; discoveries 
are supposed to be proven." 
<P>Despite these caveats, the scientists involved in Thursday's report agreed 
that there's no doubt that the planet is getting unusually hot  --  and fast. 
<P>"The last 400 years has experienced a warming. The last 25 to 30 years 
have been warmer than any comparable period (in) that span," the panel's 
chairman, physicist-climatologist Gerald North of Texas A&M University said 
Thursday in Washington.  
<P>The academy panelists also dismissed critics' earlier insinuations that 
the Mann team played fast and loose with data, a point that pleased Mann, who 
is now at Pennsylvania State University. 
<P>"The report ... provides absolutely no support for the oft-heard claims 
that the original hockey stick was the result of 'programming errors,' or was 
'not reproducible,' or there was some scientific misconduct involved," he said 
in an e-mail. "These claims were always spurious and should now finally be laid 
to rest ... The (academy) report is very good, and I'm pretty happy with it, 
especially given the short time interval over which the committee had to 
familiarize themselves with a complex and often quite technical debate."  
<P>The academy report was born from a political dispute. In 2005, the 
hockey-stick chart became the target for Sen. James Inhofe, R-Oklahoma, who 
regards global warming theory in general as a hoax. Last year, another doubter, 
Rep. Joe Barton, R-Texas, asked Mann to give the House Energy Committee his 
team's scientific data, plus details on their funding.  
<P>Barton's request sparked protests from committee member Rep. Henry Waxman, 
D-Los Angeles, and from scientific organizations who feared it was an attempt 
to intimidate researchers. 
<P>To cool tempers, Rep. Sherwood Boehlert, R-N.Y. and chair of the House 
Committee on Science, asked the academy to assess the Mann team's work. 
<P>The result is the 141-page report unveiled Thursday. It is available 
online at national-academies.org.
