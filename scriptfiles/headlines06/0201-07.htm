<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p>NEW YORK - The Bush administration has failed to convince most Americans that its spying on their phone and Internet conversations helps keep terrorists from attacking the United States, say intelligence and security analysts as well as recent polls.</p>
<p>The eavesdropping program became an open secret last month, when media reported that the U.S. government had tapped into its own citizens' phone and email exchanges with people overseas. Because the monitoring is done without first obtaining warrants, it has been roundly described as illegal under the 1978 Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA).</p>
<p>However, Bush and senior administration officials have asserted repeatedly that the operation, which the president authorized in 2002, is needed to prevent a terrorist attack comparable to those of Sep. 11, 2001.</p>
<p>Experts and the public say they are unconvinced, however.</p>
<p>''What was needed to prevent September 11 was in place before September 11,'' said Melvin Goodman, senior fellow at the Washington, D.C.-based think tank Center for International Policy.</p>
<p>Goodman, who served the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) for well over four decades, including as a senior analyst, said he believes that law enforcement agencies failed to stop the 2001 attacks because higher-ups in Washington failed to act.</p>
<p>''You had FBI field offices pointing to crucial information,'' he said, referring to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. ''But it was ignored by headquarters.''</p>
<p>A number of CIA veterans and other experts respected by their profession have faulted officials in Washington for failing to act on requests to obtain legal clearance to eavesdrop on terror suspects in the run up to the 2001 attacks. After the strikes against the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, they say, it emerged that field agents had sought to monitor conversations involving Zacarias Moussaoui, who has since been convicted on terrorism charges.</p>

<p>Likewise, critics have lambasted senior intelligence and administration officials for ignoring critical intelligence reports regarding two of the 9/11 hijackers.</p>
<p>Bush has rejected such criticism and instead has used those revelations to justify the domestic spying program, which essentially continues practices already permitted by FISA--only without meeting the law's requirement that agents first obtain a warrant from a secret court.</p>
<p>''We now know that two of the hijackers in the United States placed telephone calls to al Qaeda operatives overseas,'' Bush said Tuesday night in his annual State of the Union speech before Congress. ''But we did not know about their plans until it was too late. So to prevent another attack--based on authority given to me by the Constitution and by statute--I have authorized a terrorist surveillance program to aggressively pursue the international communications of suspected al Qaeda operatives and affiliates to and from America.''</p>
<p>But according to James Ridgeway, journalist and author of the book The Five Unanswered Questions About September 11, federal officials simply failed to take note of intelligence already available to them. The FBI's main informant in the San Diego Muslim community, he said by way of example, socialized with both the hijackers in question and reportedly rented an apartment to one of them.</p>
<p>When the Congressional joint inquiry into 9/11 sought information about the matter, Ridgeway added, federal officials balked at producing the informant to testify.</p>
<p>''The government didn't need any NSA surveillance program to find these hijackers,'' he said, referring to the National Security Agency, which runs the eavesdropping program.</p>
<p>Even so, Bush underscored the program's value in his televised speech Tuesday night.</p>
<p>''The terrorist surveillance program has helped prevent terrorist attacks. It remains essential to the security of America,'' Bush said. ''If there are people inside our country who are talking with al Qaeda, we want to know about it, because we will not sit back and wait to be hit again.''</p>
<p>Controversy, however, is not limited to whether the program breaks the law or violates constitutional privacy, free speech, and separation-of-powers protections--as claimed by two lawsuits working their way through federal courts.</p>

<p>Rather, some critics said the administration's approach was proving counterproductive.
<p>
''Almost all our national security related agencies are in disarray,'' said Sibel Edmonds, director of the National Security Whistleblowers Coalition, a nonpartisan alliance of people who blow the whistle on national security inadequacies and seek to protect others who do the same.
<p>
''They are riddled with incompetence, corruption, and in some cases criminal activities,'' Edmonds, a veteran of the FBI, said.
<p>
The Bush administration has acknowledged some problems and has said that solving them hinges on increasing the executive branch's powers.
<p>
Edmonds countered that ''the kind of power the administration pursues is the kind of power that would vault the presidency to monarchical status and nullify the Bill of Rights.''
<p>
Added Ridgeway: ''Instead of admitting government failure, President Bush now attempts to assert more government power over the citizenry he failed to protect.''
<p>
The public may share his skepticism, according to a New York Times-CBS News poll conducted last week.
<p>
The survey found that many Americans are willing to tolerate spying without warrants in a fight against terrorists but they also are concerned that aggressive antiterrorism programs are eroding their civil liberties.
<p>
Fifty-three percent of those surveyed said they supported eavesdropping without warrants ''in order to reduce the threat of terrorism,'' according to the Times.

<p>
However, the paper said that respondents ''overwhelmingly'' opposed surveillance if it was aimed at ''ordinary Americans.''</p>
