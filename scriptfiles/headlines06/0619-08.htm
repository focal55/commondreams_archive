<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><P>Dan Wood describes himself as being "politically inactive, other than 
voting'' until 2004. That's the year Howard Dean, the Democratic former 
governor of Vermont, ran for president and revolutionized a Web-based campaign 
strategy that raised money and organized volunteers. 
<P>"I guess I got sucked in,'' said Wood, a 41-year-old computer programmer 
from Alameda. 
<P>That may be an understatement. Today, he runs his own political blog, "A 
Progressive Alamedan,'' served as a delegate to this year's state Democratic 
convention and keeps politically informed through a dizzying number of Web 
sites and e-mails.  
<P>He is one of millions of voters across the nation touched by the expansion 
of tech-savvy political campaigns that increasingly are relying on computers 
and cell phones to engage voters.  
<P>"It makes it easy for people to get involved,'' said Carol Darr, director 
of George Washington University's Institute for Politics, Democracy & the 
Internet in Washington.  

<P>It also vastly expands a campaign's reach  --  at a fraction of the cost 
of the traditional campaign tools of mailers and commercials. 
<P>"Now we can press a button and instantly send a message to 50,000, 100,000 
people,'' said Bob Mulholland, senior adviser to Phil Angelides, the Democratic 
state treasurer who is challenging Republican Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger in 
November. 
<P>Mulholland said the use of technology is particularly important in this 
race, which he expects will draw national attention from both parties. 
Mulholland hopes Angelides can capitalize on the deep dissatisfaction with 
President Bush, for whom Schwarzenegger campaigned. 
<P>"I think this race will create a big buzz on the Internet,'' Mulholland 
said. 
<P>While one of the goals of a candidate's Web site is to attract volunteers 
and to cement support among the electorate, soliciting contributions online 
also is a crucial component. Special interest groups, such as those focused on 
taxes, the environment and immigration, have Web sites and e-mail lists that 
they hope will influence the outcome of an election. Blogs  --  short for Web 
logs, which are journals and newsletters  --  also are spreading political 
information. 
<P>Surprisingly, tech-focused campaigns don't just target the young. Studies 
have shown that seniors also are plugged in. The biggest factors in the tech 
divide are economics and education, said Gary Selnow, a San Francisco State 
University communications professor. 
<P>Darr, from the Institute for Politics, Democracy & the Internet, said 
online campaigns still generally resonate strongest with a particular segment 
of the population  --  a crucial group called "influencers.'' They're the 
folks, she said, who tend to head the school PTA, get involved in service 
organizations, serve on the board of the chamber of commerce, hold a seat on 
the city council and organize their local unions.  
<P>"They end up being the honeybees pollinating the culture, or, to use a 
less elegant analogy, they're like birds pooping seeds.'' 
<P>They talk up  --  or down  --  candidates in person and online. 
<P>Take Wood, the Alameda computer programmer. Not only does he publicize his 
thoughts on his blog, but he also sends blast e-mails.  
<P>He recently sent one to about 150 friends, acquaintances and relatives on 
behalf of Debra Bowen, a Democratic candidate for secretary of state. . The 
missive began: "I've written this note and I'm sending it to just about every 
Californian in my e-address book. If you're a voter and either a Democrat or 
independent, please read on. If not, please forgive the intrusion, and I'll 
catch you another time!'' 
<P>The use of new technology crosses party lines. 
<P>"We're looking forward to using technology to connect voters not only to 
the campaign but to each other,'' said Julie Soderlund, a spokeswoman for 
Schwarzenegger's re-election bid. Soderlund said the Internet is being used to 
recruit and organize volunteers, solicit donations and provide a one-stop venue 
to view  --  and hear  --  the governor's campaign platform. The site includes 
a blog and slideshows. There are plans to include podcasts and special ring 
tones for cell phones that Schwarzenegger supporters can download.  
<P>Campaigns post their television commercials online. Steve Westly, who lost 
to Angelides in the Democratic gubernatorial primary, posted a last-minute, 
visual and audio pitch targeting undecided voters.  
<P>There also are gimmicks to keep Web site visitors interested: Angelides 
has a cartoon on its Web site called "Take a Tour of Arnold's Neighborhood,'' 
and site visitors can sign an online petition voicing opposition to the 
governor's transportation policies. Opponents of Janet Reilly, who ran in the 
Democratic primary for an Assembly seat representing parts of San Francisco and 
San Mateo, created an online interactive game in which people could dress her 
in various outfits to highlight aspects of her personal financial portfolio. 
<P>The better-funded campaigns have a tech guru on staff. Many make use of 
e-mail lists, an inexpensive tool that's fairly easy to manage. The savviest 
operations mine databases to tailor messages to individual voters based on such 
indicators as a person's buying habits, gender, ethnicity, marital status, age 
and income. 

<P>Kathleen Hall Jamieson, professor of communication and director of the 
Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania, said the use 
of e-mail in political campaigns has a very specific purpose: To provide voters 
with regular reminders that their favored candidates are still in the race, 
need their vote and their money. Sometimes the message is nothing more than 
announcing an upcoming campaign event or the release of favorable polling 
information. 
<P>"It's used as a motivational tool for supporters,'' Jamieson said. 
<P>E-mail is most effective, experts say, when the recipients "opt in,'' that 
is, ask to be added to a campaign's roster. Otherwise, more often than not, the 
unsolicited e-mail is deleted before it's even read --  much like junk mail 
that lands in someone's mailbox and ends up tossed unopened into the recycling 
bin. 
<P>Campaign Web sites also are usually viewed by people already interested in 
the candidate or cause, experts say. 
<P>"People don't go searching for counter-viewpoints. They want to have their 
beliefs confirmed,'' said Selnow of S.F. State. 
<P>Undecided voters usually will navigate nonpartisan Web sites, run by 
groups such as the League of Women Voters, to get information. 
<P>Menaka Mahajan wasn't quite sure what she wanted when she logged on to 
Google in search of a local campaign where she could volunteer, with the goal 
of making contacts to help land a job.  
<P>Fresh out of UC Irvine with a degree in international studies and a focus 
on politics, Mahajan, 23, found the Web site of Fiona Ma, Reilly's opponent in 
the June 6 Assembly primary and the eventual victor. Mahajan read through Ma's 
list of endorsements, looked at the photos and glanced at Ma's priorities. 
Sold.  
<P>She clicked on the "get involved'' button, sent an e-mail to the deputy 
campaign manager and in March started volunteering  --  making telephone calls, 
walking precincts, organizing house parties. 
<P>What happened with Mahajan is an example of a broader trend, the marrying 
of technology with traditional shoe-leather campaigning  --  using voter 
contact information solicited online to follow-up with a phone call or a knock 
on the door. 
<P>"People still like the personal,'' Wood said. "They still want to see the 
candidate up close.&quot;
