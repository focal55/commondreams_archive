<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p> Average global temperatures have increased by less than 1C since the Industrial Revolution, but they are projected to increase by up to 5C over the coming century if carbon dioxide levels continue to rise without restraint. With each 1C rise in average global temperatures, the Stern Review portrays progressively more serious scenarios. </p>

        
          
          
            <p>
  <b>The five degrees of disaster
</b></p>
<p>
  <b>1C:</b> Smaller mountain glaciers disappear in Andes, threatening water 
  supply of 50 million people. More than 300,000 people extra die from 
  increase in climate-related diseases in tropical regions. Permafrost melting 
  damages roads and buildings in Canada and Russia. One in ten species 
  threatened with extinction, 80 per cent of coral suffers regular bleaching.
</p>
<p>
  <b>2C:</b> Water scarcity increases in southern Africa and the 
  Mediterranean. Significant decline in food production in Africa, where 
  malaria affects up to 60 million more people. Up to 10 million extra people 
  affected by coastal flooding each year. Arctic species, such the polar bear, 
  face extinction along with 15-40 per cent of world&rsquo;s remaining wildlife. 
  Gulf Stream begins to weaken and Greenland ice sheet begins to melt 
  irreversibly.

</p>
<p>
  <b>3C:</b> Serious droughts in southern Europe occur once every ten years. 
  Between 1 and 4 billion people suffer water shortages and a similar number 
  suffer from floods. Many millions of people at risk of malnutrition, as 
  agricultural yields at higher latitudes reach peak output. More than 100 
  million people are affected by the risk of coastal flooding. Mass extinction 
  of animals and plants accelerates.
</p>
<p>
  <b>4C:</b> Sub-Saharan Africa and the southern Mediterranean suffer between 
  30 and 50 per cent decrease in availability of water. Agricultural yields 
  decline by 15-35 per cent in Africa. Crops fail in entire regions. Up to 80 
  million extra people are exposed to malaria. Loss of around half of the 
  Arctic tundra. Many nature reserves collapse. Giant West Antarctic Ice Sheet 
  begins to melt irreversibly, threatening catastrophic increases in global 
  sea levels.
</p>
<p>
  <b>5C:</b> Possible disappearance of the large glaciers of the Himalayas, 
  affecting the water supply of 25 per cent of population of China and 
  hundreds of millions more in India. Ocean acidity increases with threat of 
  total collapse in the global fisheries industry. Sea levels rise inexorably, 
  inundating vast regions of Asia and about half of the world&rsquo;s major cities, 
  including London, New York and Tokyo.

</p>
<p>
  <b>Arctic sea ice: </b>current computer models suggest that floating summer 
  sea ice of the northern hemisphere could disappear completely by the year 
  2070. Some experts believe that this summer polar ice could disappear even 
  earlier this century with accelerating warming trends - making the polar 
  bear extinct.
</p>
<p>
  <b>The Asian monsoon: </b>In India the monsoon provides between 75 and 90 
  per cent of annual rainfall. Global warming is projected to increase the 
  severity and possibly the unpredictability of the monsoon, increasing the 
  risk of severe flooding or even monsoon failure at the time of year when it 
  is needed most.
</p>
<p>
  <b>West Antarctic ice sheet: </b>as global average temperatures rise then so 
  does the risk of crossing a threshold beyond which the world&rsquo;s biggest ice 
  sheets being to melt irreversibly. This would commit sea levels to a rise by 
  between 5 metres and 12 metres over the coming centuries. Currently 270 
  million people live in coastal areas threatened by a 5 metre rise in sea 
  levels.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Sub-Saharan Africa: </b>this region will bear the brunt of climate 
  change. Scientists predict a 30 per cent decline in annual water 
  availability. Droughts will increase crop failures and malnutrition. Many 
  tens of millions of extra people will be exposed to lethal tropical disease 
  such as malaria.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Australia: </b>many regions of the world will become too hot for cereal 
  crops if average global temperatures rise to 4C. Vast tracts of Australia&rsquo;s 
  richest agricultural land will become no-go areas for arable farming.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Amazon rainforest: </b>continued deforestation of the tropical 
  rainforests increases the amount of carbon dioxide circulating in the 
  atmosphere. As temperatures continue to rise, scientists fear that local 
  droughts and soil erosion could cause the complete collapse of the remaining 
  rainforests.
</p>
<p>

  <b>Siberian permafrost: </b>as temperatures rise, the permanently frozen 
  tundra of the northern hemisphere begins to melt, releasing its vast store 
  of methane - a greenhouse gas which is 20 times more potent than carbon 
  dioxide. Buildings and roads built on the permafrost collapse - but this is 
  one area of the world that could otherwise benefit from warmer temperatures 
  and a longer growing season.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Gulf Stream: </b>The thermohaline circulation is like a conveyor belt in 
  the North Atlantic Ocean bringing huge amounts of heat from the tropics to 
  north-western Europe. As sea temperatures rise, there is a risk that the 
  cold, salty &ldquo;engine&rdquo; of the circulation slows down or even stops, blocking 
  the flow of the warm Gulf Stream that keep British winters mild.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Malnutrition: </b>Around 800 million people (12 per cent of the global 
  population) are currently at risk of hunger and malnutrition. Temperature 
  rises of between 2C and 3C could increase this number by between 30 million 
  and 200 million. A further 1C rise would add an extra 500 million to the 
  number of people at risk of malnutrition.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Ocean acidification: </b>Extra carbon dioxide in the atmosphere dissolves 
  in seawater causing an increase in ocean acidification. The predicted 
  increase in acidification over the next century have not been experienced 
  for hundreds of thousands of years. One outcome could be the death of many 
  marine ecosystems, such as coral reefs. More than 1 billion people worldwide 
  currently rely on fish as their primary source of animal protein.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Flooding: </b>A rise in average temperatures of 3C or 4C is projected to 
  cause an increase in sea levels of between 20cm and 80cm. This means that 
  between 20 million and 300 million extra people will be flooded out of their 
  homes each year. South East Asia is particularly vulnerable because of poor 
  coastal defences.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Mass extinction: </b>Species living in vulnerable regions, such as alpine 
  ecosystems and tropical mountain habitats, are likely to disappear with even 
  quite modest increases in global temperatures. A increase of 3C could 
  threaten between 20 and 50 per cent of animals and plants with extinction - 
  the sixth mass extinction in the history of life on Earth and the only one 
  to be caused by another species, man.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Extreme weather: </b>A warmer world is expected to increase the frequency 
  and severity of heatwaves, storms and hurricanes. Winds speeds of tropical 
  storms for instance increase by between 15 and 20 per cent for a 3C increase 
  in tropical sea temperatures. More violent winds and storms will 
  significantly increase the damage to buildings and other valuable 
  infrastructure.
