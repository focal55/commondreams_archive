The bomb attack has enraged the majority Shia population, who regard the 
  shrine in the same way that Roman Catholics view St Peter's in Rome.
<p>
  In a number of respects civil war in Iraq has already begun. Many of the 
  thousand bodies a month arriving in the morgues in Baghdad are of people 
  killed for sectarian reasons. It is no longer safe for members of the three 
  main communities &shy; the Sunni and Shia Arabs and the Kurds &shy; to visit each 
  other's parts of the country.

Iraqis rally in reaction to the explosion at a Shiite shrine in Samarra, in Baghdad's Shiite district of Sadr City, Wednesday, Feb. 22, 2006. A large explosion Wednesday heavily damaged the golden dome of one of Iraq's most famous Shiite religious shrines, sending protesters pouring into the streets. It was the third major attack against Shiite targets in as many days. The poster shows picture of radical Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr. (AP Photo/Karim Kadim)<br>

"Iraq is in a Weimar period like Germany in the 1920s which will either 
  end with the country disintegrating or in an authoritarian government taking 
  power," said Ghassan Atiyyah, an Iraqi political commentator. 
</p>
<p>
  The Golden Mosque in Samarra, north of Baghdad, was attacked at 6.55am 
  yesterday when men dressed in police uniform tied up the guards and planted 
  explosives. It was the third and most devastating attack on the Shia in Iraq 
  in three days. A car bomb had killed 22 people in a Shia district of Baghdad 
  late the previous night. The day before 12 died when a suicide bomber blew 
  himself up in a bus in the Shia stronghold of Khadamiyah in west Baghdad. 
</p>
<p>
  "We should stand hand in hand to prevent the danger of civil war," 
  warned President Jalal Talabani. "We are facing a major conspiracy that 
  is targeting Iraq's unity." He called for the formation of a national 
  unity government that "will bring stability to Iraq". 
</p>
<p>
  There was little sign of stability yesterday. Some 50 Sunni mosques were 
  either burnt, blown up or taken over in Baghdad alone. At least three Sunni 
  clerics were among 22 reported deaths nationwide.
</p>

<p>
  Gunmen in police uniforms seized a dozen Sunni men suspected of being 
  insurgents from a prison in the mainly Shia city of Basra yesterday and 
  later killed 11 of them. Among those killed in the apparent reprisal attack 
  for the bombing of the Samarra shrine were two Egyptians.
</p>
<p>
  Armed militiamen of the Mehdi Army supporting the radical nationalist 
  clergyman Muqtada al-Sadr took up positions on the streets of Baghdad and in 
  the Shia cities of the south yesterday. Mr Al-Sadr himself is returning 
  quickly to Iraq after cancelling a meeting with the Lebanese President. One 
  of his aides said: "If the Iraqi government does not do its job to 
  defend the Iraqi people, we are ready to do so." A Sunni politician, 
  Tariq al-Hashimi, urged clerics and politicians to calm the situation "
  before it spins out of control".
</p>
<p>
  As news spread of sectarian clashes and demonstrations people in Baghdad 
  rushed home before dark and some started to stock up on food. In Najaf, 
  another Shia holy city, protesters chanted: "Rise up Shia! Take revenge!
  "
</p>
<p>
  The destruction of the Golden Mosque will be an immense psychological blow 
  to Iraqi Shia who have endured so much down the centuries. The shrine 
  contains the tombs of the 10th and 11th imams, Ali al-Hadi who died AD868 
  and his son Hassan Ali al-Askari who died AD874. His son, the last of the 12 
  Shia imams, Mohammed al-Mahdi, disappeared and is known as the "hidden 
  imam". Shias believe he is still alive and will bring justice to 
  humanity. 
</p>
<p>

  The shrine is very difficult to defend. The majority of people in Samarra 
  are Sunni and in 2004 the city was taken by Islamic extremists before being 
  recaptured by the Americans. Although I was searched the last time I visited 
  the mosque, it has large gateways through the outer wall into an inner 
  courtyard which armed men would find easy to storm. The shrine guards, who 
  might detect a single bomber, were evidently not able to stop a unit of 
  armed and determined men posing as police.
</p>
<p>
  In one of the most serious acts of retaliation Shia protesters set fire 
  yesterday to a famous Sunni shrine on the outskirts of Basra. It contains 
  the tomb of Talha bin-Obeid-Allah, a companion of the Prophet Mohamed. The 
  extent of the damage was not known.
</p>
<p>
  Iraq has always been riven by sectarian divisions. Saddam Hussein's regime 
  was primarily Sunni, though they are only 20 per cent of the population, 
  while the Shia were politically marginalised. Friction between Shia and 
  Sunni has increased since the US invasion as the Sunni resisted the 
  occupation while the Shia demanded elections which they were bound to win 
  because they are a majority of the population. If the Shia do hold power it 
  will be the first time they have had their own state in the Arab world since 
  the 12th century. 
</p>
<p>
  The parliamentary election on 15 December confirmed the Shia dominance, with 
  their coalition winning 128 out of 275 seats. The vote was almost entirely 
  along sectarian or ethnic lines.
</p>
<p>
  The Shia clerical leader, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, called for a week 
  of mourning, forbade attacks on Sunni mosques and asked people to protest 
  peacefully. He made a rare appearance on television yesterday, being shown 
  meeting in his house in Najaf three other grand ayatollahs to discuss the 
  destruction of the mosque in Samarra. There was no audio but a statement 
  from Ayatollah Sistani's office said: "We call upon believers to 
  express their protest ... through peaceful means. The extent of their sorrow 
  and shock should not drag them into taking actions that serve the enemies 
  who have been working to lead Iraq into sectarian strife."

</p>
<p>
  In the past his appeals for calm have been heeded, despite a long series of 
  atrocities by suicide bombers against the Shia beginning in August 2003 
  which has left several thousand dead. 
</p>
<p>
  There are signs that the Shias' patience is now growing thin. Death squads 
  targeting Sunni operate in Baghdad.
</p>
<p>
  The prolonged negotiations to form a new government underlines the 
  difficulty the Shia, Kurds and Sunni are having in reaching an accommodation 
  which will hold Iraq together. The Kurds have always demanded a degree of 
  autonomy under a federal system which would give them quasi-independence. 
  Under the constitution supported in a referendum by Kurds and Shia last 
  October, the nine Shia provinces of the south would also become a canton 
  largely independent of Baghdad. One Iraqi minister laments that "the 
  Iraqi government may end up as a collection of buildings in the Green Zone"
. 
</p>
<p>
  Although the US and the Kurds are demanding a national unity government, 
  Shia leaders suspect that this is a manoeuvre by the US to keep them out of 
  power. Washington has long been worried that the outcome of its invasion and 
  overthrow of Saddam would be a Shia-dominated Islamic republic closely 
  linked to Iran. It is also concerned with the rise of Mr al-Sadr, always 
  against the occupation, to the position of power broker in the Shia 
  coalition.
</p>

<p>
  There are signs of increasing anti-American feeling among the Shia as they 
  see the Americans allying themselves with the Sunni. As news spread of the 
  attack on the Golden Mosque yesterday, thousands of young men marched 
  shouting anti-American slogans through Sadr City, the great Shia slum with a 
  population of two million. About 3,000 people marched through the Shia city 
  of Kut shouting slogans against America and Israel and burning US and 
  Israeli flags.
</p>
<p>
  The extent of Shia retaliation may also depend on the Iranian government. 
  The Iranian supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, urged Shia not to seek 
  revenge against Sunni Muslims, saying there were definite plots "to 
  force the Shia to attack the mosques and other properties respected by the 
  Sunni. Any measure to contribute to that direction is helping the enemies of 
  Islam and is forbidden by sharia." 
</p>
<p>
  Instead Ayatollah Khamenei blamed the intelligence services of the US and 
  Israel for being behind the bombs in Samarra.
