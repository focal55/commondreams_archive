It's unheard of to see hipsters waiting in line outside the Mission 
District's Make-Out Room club at the ordinarily sleepy hour of 7 p.m. on a 
Monday. Especially ones ready to pay at least $10 to get into a literary 
reading.

But there they were, queuing up for what has become one of San Francisco's 
hottest recurring literary gigs, the monthly Progressive Reading Series  --  
progressive in the political sense, that is. They're coming even if they have 
little idea that their door fee is part of a new wave of liberal fundraising, 
one that sugarcoats the urgency for political involvement with a healthy layer 
of partying.  
<P>Events such as the Progressive Reading Series are an indication of the 
interest that liberal organizers are showing in the traditionally unsexy topic 
of midterm congressional elections. The beneficiaries are largely politicians 
far outside the Bay Area's politically blue bubble. 
<P>Realizing there's no need to spend energy on safe congressional seats on 
left-leaning coasts, liberal activists are soliciting cash for Democratic 
candidates battling for an estimated 30 competitive House seats in the middle 
of the country. The take from the most recent reading night, for example, went 
to a liberal hopeful in New Mexico. 
<P>Closer to home, organizers are recruiting liberals to take a rare 
political pilgrimage east of the Caldecott Tunnel. The Bay Area's only 
competitive congressional race is expected to be in a district that sprawls 
from Contra Costa County to the Central Valley, where three Democrats are vying 
to take on Rep. Richard Pombo, R-Tracy.  
<P>Liberal interest in this November's elections is being driven largely by 
the "netroots"  --  people who became politically active during the 
Internet-driven 2004 presidential campaign of Howard Dean and, locally, as part 
of Green Party candidate Matt Gonzalez's 2003 mayoral run in San Francisco. 
<P>"It's a nationwide phenomenon," said Markos Moulitsas Zuniga of Berkeley, 
whose DailyKos.com is the nation's largest political blog, with 600,000 daily 
visitors. "And it's especially true around here, where the Pombo race is the 
most competitive race within a million miles of Berkeley. 
<P>"More people are realizing that they can't just get involved every four 
years," said Zuniga, who bought five new servers in anticipation of interest in 
election night 2006. 

<P>Democrat John Kerry's loss in the 2004 presidential race "was the best 
thing to happen to the progressive movement," Zuniga said, "because it taught 
people that this wouldn't be won or lost in a year. It's a multiyear-long 
process, and it is going to take their involvement every year." 
<P>Getting involved in midterm elections has been the top priority of the 3.3 
million members of the liberal online hub MoveOn.org since August, according to 
the group's weekly surveys. The group plans to organize members living in 
"safe" Democratic congressional districts to make phone calls on behalf of 
candidates in close races in other parts of the country. 
<P>On Wednesday, MoveOn.org announced that it would try to raise $2 million 
from its members to "saturate" five yet-to-be-determined, GOP-held 
congressional districts with TV commercials.  
<P>"In 2002, the election was much more localized than in 2006," said 
MoveOn.org spokeswoman Jennifer Lindenauer. Now, she said, "we're hearing so 
much about the possibility of a 'change election,' which motivates people. 
People are looking at what they can do to change the Congress." 
<P>California Republican officials haven't yet noticed a similar bubbling of 
midterm interest among conservative activists, but as state party spokesman 
Patrick Dorinson said, "It's still really early. We probably won't see a higher 
level of enthusiasm until after the primary."  
<P>In Pombo's race, "the Democrats need to bring people in from the outside 
because they've got no clue what's going on in that district," said Wayne 
Johnson, a Pombo campaign spokesman. "We'll be fine with the volunteers from 
the district who we already have there." 
<P>Interest in liberal political campaigns is being stoked through a network 
of activist groups that have sprung up since the 2002 elections. From the 
weekly chapter meetings of drinkingliberally.org  --  where lefties gather in 
bars to tip ales and talk political smack  --  to regular clubbing events such 
as "Hustle for Change" thrown recently by the League of Pissed-Off Voters, 
organizers are trying to brew a politics-and-fun mix. 
<P>But underneath the fun is movement-building. San Francisco-based Music for 
America organizes politically through club shows supported by its 60,000 
members and 350 partner bands. Over the next few weeks, it will roll out a way 
for on-stage musicians to help young people register to vote via text messaging 
on cell phones. 
<P>And coming soon to the Bay Area: a political party called Kegs for Change. 
Popularized in Minnesota by a Music for America member, it goes like this: 
Instead of paying $4 for a cup at a keg party, partygoers pay only $3  --  if 
they place a call to a congressional representative about an issue.  
<P>Disclaimer: The cup-holding lobbyists must call before drinking, as 
organizers note that drunk-dialing Congress isn't an effective lobbying tool. 
<P>"We always try to make the events fun, but many of our members are more 
interested in issues than candidates," said Molly Moon Neitzel, Music for 
America's executive director. The group will honor top-selling punk band Green 
Day for its political work in San Francisco  tonight. 
<P>Even Washington Beltway politicians such as Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., 
are being influenced by such "fun raisers." 
<P>On Saturday, Boxer's political action committee will hold a fundraiser in 
Medjool Restaurant, a Mission District club and bar, with a twist for a 
politician accustomed to $1,000-a-plate fundraisers at the Fairmont Hotel: The 
cheapest ticket will be $25, and a DJ will spin tunes until 2 a.m., long past 
bedtime for most of the usual crowd at fundraisers. 
<P>There will be "action booths" set up in one part of the club where people 
can volunteer to walk precincts in Tracy for a Democrat challenging Pombo or 
make calls for Francine Busby, a Democrat running to replace disgraced former 
GOP Rep. Randy "Duke" Cunningham in San Diego. 
<P>"We just don't do fundraisers like that," said Doug Boxer, the senator's 
son, who runs the political action committee. "You just don't make a lot of 
money, and there's a lot of time and effort to coordinate it. But here, we're 
measuring the success of it in a different way: How many people signed up to 
walk precincts, or make calls? 
<P>"There's a lot of people wanting to know how they can get involved," he 
said. "We're trying to put the fun back in fundraiser." 
<P>With a giant mirrored ball throwing light on the audience, the fun 
quotient was high in the Make-Out Room one recent night for the Progressive 
Reading Series, which is held the second Monday of every month. San Francisco 
author and political junkie Stephen Elliott, who organizes the event, said the 
200 attendees had contributed $2,700 for New Mexico Attorney General Patricia 
Madrid, a Democrat who is challenging GOP incumbent Rep. Heather Wilson for her 
congressional seat. 

<P>While that is small change in a campaign where each candidate is expected 
to spend several million dollars, organizers are more interested in igniting 
interest in the big picture of midterm elections.  
<P>The entertainment that evening was for people like Nina Krieger, a 
creative-writing student at the University of San Francisco who came to hear 
the writer Tobias Wolff speak. Then she found out that she had to pay $10 at 
the door. 
<P>"That's OK, though," Krieger shouted above the music filling the club 
before the writers went on. "It's in a bar, there's beer  --  it's more like a 
party atmosphere. And hey, it's for a good cause."
