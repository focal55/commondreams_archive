        All United Nations arms embargoes have been breached with impunity, with only a handful of the weapons traffickers responsible for the trade in death ever facing prosecution, according to a report.

        <!--/endimage/--> Despite the UN naming hundreds of companies - including those in Britain - 
  for allegedly violating embargoes imposed on countries engaged in bloody 
  conflicts and repression, the system for bringing them to book has abjectly 
  failed.
</p>
<p>
  The report, by leading human rights groups, presented to the UN Security 
  Council today, asks for urgent measures to control the proliferation, 
  including agreement on an international arms trade treaty.
</p>
<p>
  The call for reform is backed in a letter by, among others, the Nobel 
  laureates Archbishop Desmond Tutu, Jody Williams and Oscar Arias; the former 
  UN high commissioner for human rights Mary Robinson; the actors Helen 
  Mirren, Christopher Ecclestone and Tony Robinson; the author and activist 
  Arundhati Roy; Lt-Gen Romeo Dellaire, who led UN forces during the Rwanda 
  genocide, and the Albert Schweitzer Institute.

</p>
<p>
  "Today, millions of people around the world are living in fear of armed 
  violence," the letter says. "They have good reason to be afraid. 
  Most victims of armed violence are not uniformed soldiers, nor even 
  fighters, but ordinary men, women and children.
</p>
<p>
  "In 2006, the world can make the first step towards bringing the arms 
  trade under control, by starting negotiations on an international arms trade 
  treaty.
</p>
<p>
  "What we are calling for is not revolutionary. It simply consolidates 
  countries' existing and emerging obligations under international law into a 
  universal standard for arms sales. But it has the power to save hundreds of 
  thousands of lives."
</p>
<p>
  The dossier, by <a href="http://www.oxfam.org">Oxfam International</a>, <a href="http://www.amnesty.org">Amnesty International</a> and <a href="http://www.iansa.org/">International 
  Action Network on Small Arms</a> describes how companies and individuals have 
  been involved in illicit transactions in weapons.
</p>

<p>
  Four UK companies were named in UN embargo reports in the past 10 years. 
  None are known to have faced prosecution by the British government.
</p>
<p>
  The proposed treaty has the backing of 45 countries, including the UK and 
  other members of the EU as well as Britain's Defence Manufacturers 
  Association. However, the US, Russia and China, responsible for a large 
  percentage of world arms exports, are yet to give support.
</p>
<p>
  The report, UN Arms Embargo: An overview of the last 10 years, points out 
  that, despite UN mandatory arms embargoes being legally binding, many member 
  states have not made their violation a criminal offence.
</p>
<p>
  UN teams policing the embargoes are given "woefully inadequate 
  resources and time" to pursue wealthy companies with influential vested 
  interests. There are also numerous examples of corrupt officials covering up 
  arms transfers with the use of faked documentation.
</p>
<p>

  Campaigners say the structure of embargoes and sanctions needs to be 
  overhauled. Between 1990 and 2001, only eight of 57 conflicts, in some of 
  the poorest countries on Earth, led to UN action and then only after 
  widespread human rights abuse and bloodshed.
</p>
<p>
  The dossier uses the example of a Serbian company, Temex, which, according 
  to the UN, delivered nearly 210 tons of arms and ammunition to Liberia in 
  2002. It included "five million rounds of ammunition; 5,160 guns, 2,500 
  hand grenades, 6,500 mines and 350 missile launchers.
</p>
<p>
  "These shipments include enough bullets to kill the entire population 
  of Liberia ... and enough to keep an armed group of 10,000 fighters supplied 
  for a whole year," it says.
