show U.S. Army investigators closed a probe into allegations an
Iraqi detainee had been abused by a shadowy military task force
after its members used fake names and asserted that key
computer files had been lost.</p>
<p>The documents shed light on Task Force 6-26, a special
operations unit, and confirmed the existence of a secret
military "Special Access Program" associated with it, ACLU
lawyer Amrit Singh said on Thursday.</p>
<p>The documents were released by the Army to the American
Civil Liberties Union under court order through the Freedom of
Information Act. They were the latest files to provide details
of the numerous investigations carried out by the Army into
allegations of detainee abuse in Iraq.</p>
<p>A June 2005 document by the U.S. Army Criminal
Investigation Command in Iraq described its investigation into
suspected abuse of a detainee captured in January 2004 by Task
Force 6-26 in Tikrit, deposed President Saddam Hussein's
hometown. His name was redacted, but he was mentioned as the
son of a Saddam bodyguard.</p>
<p>The man was taken to Baghdad international airport,
documents stated. The United States maintains a prison there
for "high-value" detainees.</p>
<p>He told Army investigators that U.S. personnel forced him
one night to remove his clothes, walk into walls with a box
over his head connected to a rope around his neck, punched him
in the spinal area until he fainted, placed him in front of an
air conditioner while cold water was poured on him, and kicked
him in the stomach until he vomited, the documents stated.</p>
<p>'FAKE NAMES'</p>
<p>Investigators could not find the personnel involved or the
man's medical files, and the case was closed, the files stated.
A memo listed the suspected offenses as "aggravated assault,
cruelty and maltreatment."</p>
<p>"The only names identified by this investigation were
determined to be fake names utilized by the capturing
soldiers," the memo stated. "6-26 also had a major computer
malfunction which resulted in them losing 70 percent of their
files; therefore they can't find the cases we need to review."</p>

<p>The memo said the investigation should not be reopened.
"Hell, even if we reopened it we wouldn't get anymore
information than we already have," the memo stated.</p>
<p>Singh said previous documents indicated Task Force 6-26 was
linked to other instances of detainee abuse in Iraq.</p>
<p>"This document suggests that Task Force 6-26 was part of a
larger, clandestine program that we think may have links with
high-ranking officials, because obviously someone high up had
the authority to put this program in place," Singh said in a
telephone interview.</p>
<p>Army spokesman Paul Boyce said the Army had taken
allegations of detainee abuse "extremely seriously."</p>
<p>"The Army has gone to great extent in travel, interviews,
documentation and concern to make sure that each and every
allegation was thoroughly reviewed, thoroughly examined and,
when appropriate, acted upon either through nonjudicial or
judicial punishment," Boyce said.</p>
<p>A document stated Army investigators were not able to fully
investigate suspects and witnesses because they were involved
in the Special Access Program and due to the classified nature
of their work.</p>
<p>The task force is stationed out of Fort Bragg, North
Carolina, the document said. The base houses the Army Special
Operations Command.
