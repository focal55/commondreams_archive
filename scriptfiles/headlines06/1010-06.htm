<p>A United States Defence Department investigation that found
David Hicks suffered no abuse while in US custody was the "biggest
cover-up of all time", his US military lawyer says.</p>

Major Michael Mori, who has represented Mr Hicks since 2003,
said last year's Navy Criminal Investigative Service investigation
was a whitewash, and that his own "minimal investigations" had
confirmed his client had been physically abused.</p>
<p>Major Mori told the <i>Herald</i> that it was likely that Mr
Hicks had been stomped on during his detention. He had also been
able to verify that Mr Hicks, 31, had had his head "rammed in" when
detained by US forces in Afghanistan, rendering him
unconscious.</p>
<p>Major Mori said four other Guantanamo detainees had corroborated
another claim by Mr Hicks that he and other detainees were
subjected to random beatings by their guards.</p>
<p>He said the US Navy investigation did not accept the testimony
because the detainees were hooded and could not visually confirm
the allegations.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister, John Howard, and other senior ministers have
relied on the US Navy investigation to reject allegations of abuse
against Mr Hicks and a former Australian detainee at Guantanamo,
Mamdouh Habib.</p>
<p>A cable sent from Australia's Washington embassy to Mr Howard's
office in July last year outlines the findings of the US Navy
investigation. The cable, obtained under the Freedom of Information
Act, said "an extraordinary effort" was made by the US Navy to the
investigate allegations of abuse.</p>
<p>It concluded: "The Australian Government's regular visits to Mr
Hicks &#8230; have enabled us to assess first hand [the US]
Department of Defence's treatment of Australian detainees at
Guantanamo Bay.</p>

<p>"The Department of Defence treats all detainees humanely. They
are provided food, religious materials, shelter, medical care, mail
service, reading materials and clothing."</p>
<p>Despite the Government's acceptance of US Navy investigation,
allegations of abuse against Mr Hicks and other detainees continue
to be made.</p>
<p>Last weekend fresh claims of abuse emerged, with an affidavit
from a US marine who said guards bragged about routinely beating
inmates.</p>
<p>The marine told of one guard who bragged about slamming the head
of a detainee into a cell door. His statement said other guards
spoke of hitting detainees and denying them water.</p>
