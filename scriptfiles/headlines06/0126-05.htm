Senior officials from Fatah, the movement which has dominated Palestinian politics for years, privately acknowledged that they had been beaten into second place by Hamas which was contesting its first parliamentary election.</p>
<p>The central elections commision said the official result would not be announced until 7 pm (1700 GMT), but Hamas was confident that it would now have an absolute majority in the 132-seat parliament.</p>
<p>Israel warned it would not do business with a group which still advocates the use of violence and refuses to recognise its right to exist.</p>
<p>US President George W. Bush also cold-shouldered Hamas, reaffirming its status in Washington's eyes as a terrorist organisation.</p>
<p>Exit polls released after voting ended late Wednesday had forecast that while Hamas would deprive Fatah of the clear majority that it has enjoyed since the parliament was first elected a decade ago, it would still only come second.</p>

<p>By Thursday, however, Fatah was conceding that the result would be even worse.</p>
<p>"Hamas has beaten Fatah in the elections," said one senior official who stood for election to the Ramallah-based parliament.</p>
<p>Another candidate who was a senior member of the Fatah campaign agreed that Hamas had won.</p>
<p>"They have won more seats than us in the legislative council," he told AFP.</p>
<p>Hamas spokesman Sami Abu Zuhri insisted the movement had secured an absolute majority and won at least 75 seats.</p>
<p>"Hamas has registered a considerable victory. Countries in the region and the international community must respect our people's choice, which is the result of democracy," the group's chief candidate, Ismail Haniya, told AFP.</p>
<p>Asked about Hamas's participation in the Palestinian government if the group's victory is confirmed, Haniya remained elusive, limiting his comments to talk of "political partnership".</p>
<p>"In the light of these first results, we will consult president Abu Mazen (Abbas) and the Fatah brothers on the type of political partnership," he said.</p>
<p>As the votes began being counted on Wedneday night, Palestinian leader Mahmud Abbas said his people had opened a new chapter in their troubled history and called for international assistance to revive stalled peace talks.</p>

<p>"We have embarked on a new era, and we need the international community's help so that we can return to the negotiations on a final peace agreement with Israel," Abbas said.</p>
<p>But Israel's acting leader Ehud Olmert said the Jewish state would not allow Hamas, responsible for dozens of suicide bombings over the past five years, to become part of the Palestinian Authority.</p>
<p>"Israel cannot allow Hamas to become part of the Palestinian Authority in its current form," Olmert said.</p>
<p>The charter of Hamas calls for the destruction of the Jewish state and the group has vowed not to disarm after entering parliament.</p>
<p>Hamas has sought to cash in on disillusionment with Fatah over the stalled peace process, corruption and by claiming its fighters forced Israel to pull out of the Gaza Strip last summer.</p>
<p>Bush made clear in a Wall Street Journal interview that the United States would continue to blacklist Hamas, regardless of the result.</p>
<p>"A political party, in order to be viable, is one that professes peace, in my judgment, in order that it will keep the peace," Bush said.</p>
<p>"And so you're getting a sense of how I'm going to deal with Hamas if they end up in positions of responsibility. And the answer is not until you renounce your desire to destroy Israel will we deal with you."</p>
