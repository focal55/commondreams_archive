<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><P>Stanford University's Joel Beinin is used to criticism for his views on 
the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, but when a conservative commentator put the 
professor's photo on the cover of a booklet titled "Campus Support for 
Terrorism,'' it started a whole new war. 
<P>Beinin, a prominent Middle Eastern scholar, filed suit in March  --  
turning his ideological clash with FrontPageMag.com Editor in Chief David 
Horowitz into a legal one.  
<P>Horowitz removed the photo from later printings, but Beinin said the harm 
had already been done and is demanding unspecified damages. With the United 
States at war in Iraq, Beinin said, it's a scary time to be labeled a supporter 
of terrorism. 
<P>"Horowitz is  --  if not a coordinated part  --  part of a broader attack 
against people who speak out against Bush's Middle Eastern policies," said 
Beinin, past president of the Middle Eastern Studies Association. "If you don't 
fight back and allow the Horowitzes to do and say what they want, it pollutes 
the political environment to the point where you can't have intelligent 
discussions about what we do in the world."  
<P>While he believes what Horowitz did was libelous, Beinin isn't suing on 
those grounds. Instead, he selected a more clear-cut legal challenge  --  
copyright infringement for unauthorized use of his photo. 
<P>Horowitz, who said he didn't know the photo was copyrighted, argues he's 
the victim in the dispute. 

<P>"It's an abuse of the courts to chill my free speech," Horowitz said of 
Beinin's lawsuit. "If he wants a debate, I will come to Stanford and debate 
him."  
<P>Both men are Jewish, but they stand on opposite sides of a deep fault line 
of opinion on Israel and its actions in the Middle East. Beinin believes 
Horowitz's antipathy toward him stems in part from the fact that he is Jewish  
--  Horowitz calls Beinin a "self-hating Jew"  --  and that he has criticized 
Israel's treatment of the Palestinians and called for a Palestinian state.  
<P>Horowitz, who is frequently seen on cable television programs such as "The 
O'Reilly Factor," is a 1960s radical turned conservative who founded the Center 
for the Study of Popular Culture. The center has since been renamed the David 
Horowitz Freedom Center and is publisher of the online magazine Front Page. His 
books include "Unholy Alliance: Radical Islam and the American Left."  
<P>He calls Beinin an "apologist for terror" and not only published Beinin's 
photo on the cover of "Campus Support for Terrorism" but featured him in his 
subsequent book, "The Professors: The 101 Most Dangerous Academics in America." 

<P>He accuses Beinin, among other things, of saying the late Palestinian 
leader Yasser Arafat shouldn't be considered a terrorist but should be 
respected as the Palestinian Authority's elected president.  
<P>Beinin called that a typical Horowitz distortion.  
<P>"He gets everything wrong," Beinin said. "His mode of operation is to 
distort and misquote and confuse people by piecing things together that don't 
belong together."  
<P>Arafat, Beinin agrees, was responsible for many acts of terror but as 
president of the Palestinian Authority needed to be dealt with internationally 
as a statesman.  
<P>Beinin's lawsuit reads in part, "Mr. Horowitz's most recent 'campaign' has 
been to attack the integrity, scholarship and patriotism of academics who 
question American foreign policy in an overt attempt to intimidate and silence 
them for fear of being labeled as Islamic terrorists or collaborators." 
<P>He is seeking an unspecified amount in damages in federal court.  
<P>Beinin was one of the nation's first Middle Eastern scholars fluent in 
both Hebrew and Arabic. He spent a year on the Kibbutz Lahav in Israel before 
earning a master's degree at Harvard. Briefly disillusioned with academia, he 
made doors for Dodge trucks in Detroit, where he helped Arab autoworkers 
understand their rights.  
<P>Talking about Israel and the Palestinians has always been difficult in the 
United States, he said, and during his doctoral studies at the University of 
Michigan, he followed his thesis supervisor's advice not to write about the 
subject  if he wanted a job in academia. Stanford hired him in 1983 to teach 
Middle Eastern studies.  
<P>The Beinin-Horowitz controversy is just one example of how the 
Israeli-Palestinian conflict has seeped into academia here and abroad. In 
Britain, the largest association of higher education instructors voted in May 
to ask its members to consider boycotting their Israeli academic counterparts 
who don't publicly dissociate themselves from Israel's policies toward the 
Palestinians.  
<P>In the United States, the activist group Al-Awda, the Palestine Right to 
Return Coalition, held a conference at San Francisco State University in July 
and called on Palestinians to protest at the Israeli consulate, while the 
Philadelphia-based organization Campus Watch began asking students in 2002 to 
monitor their professors for perceived anti-Israel bias. 
<P>In recent years, Middle Eastern studies in the United States have come 
under scrutiny by Horowitz and others who believe faculty are too sympathetic 
to Palestinian issues and unreasonably hostile to Israeli policies, said 
Jonathan Knight, who directs the program in academic freedom and tenure for the 
American Association of University Professors in Washington.  
<P>"As long as faculty are free to question accepted ideas and notions, there 
will always be those disturbed by their questioning, and there will always be 
those who will call for restraints on freedom," he said.  
<P>Knight cited Columbia University, where the administration formed an ad 
hoc committee in 2005 to investigate the classroom behavior of Middle Eastern 
studies Professor Joseph Massad after student complaints. Knight fears such 
censure is having a chilling affect on academia.  

<P>Campus Watch  --  a project by the Middle East Forum  --  has encouraged 
students to monitor professors for perceived anti-Israel bias and report their 
findings. The Campus Watch Web site has many articles about Beinin.  
<P>To stop professors from discussing their political opinions in the 
classroom, Horowitz has shopped his "Academic Bill of Rights" around the 
country and has succeeded in getting legislation to that effect introduced in 
16 states, although no legislature has passed it. Still, Horowitz said he 
believes his bill has influenced debate.  
<P>"My model for academia is the Columbia I went to in the 1950s  --  I want 
to see it depoliticized," he said. "I never heard a teacher one time express a 
political opinion. That's what I want. There's massive abuse going on."  
<P>He is incensed that in 2003 Beinin held a class lecture at a "teach-in" 
against the Iraq war in Stanford's quad.  
<P>The lecture that day on the Gulf War happened to be relevant, Beinin said, 
but was "definitely an act of solidarity with the teach-in."  
<P>"This is as close to the line of putting politics in the classroom that 
I've ever done," he said. "I don't hide my opinion."
