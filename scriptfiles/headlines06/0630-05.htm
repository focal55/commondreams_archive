Marine recruiters in Flint, Michigan approaching teenagers outside a shopping mall to enlist them in the military.<br>
&quot;Maybe we can get you a career in music, you know, let the Marines go for it. I'm sure you know who Shaggy is, right? How about a former Marine? Did you know that?&quot;<br>

Staff Sergeant Raymond Plouhar, 30, died on Monday of wounds suffered while on duty in Anbar province. He had barely a month left of his tour of duty in Iraq, where he was in charge of detecting and detonating makeshift bombs.<P>Sgt Plouhar had been angered by his depiction in the anti-war movie, where he was shown aggressively pressing young men to enlist, his family told the Detroit Free Press.<P>The Marine Corps later accused the film's maker, Michael Moore, of duping its recruiting teams into allowing their work to be caught on camera.<P>In the 2004 film Sgt Plouhar is shown approaching young African American men in the car park of a shopping mall in one of the poorest parts of Flint, and assuring them that joining the Marine Corps could help them become professional basketball players.<P>He tells his fellow recruiter he chose the location deliberately because it was in a depressed area. "It's better to get them when they're in ones and twos and work on them that way," Sgt Plouhar tells the recruiter.<P>Sgt Plouhar had turned to recruiting during a four-year break from active duty after he donated one of his kidneys to an uncle.
