<p>The chief judge in Saddam Hussein's trial has submitted his resignation, a court official said Saturday, but it wasn't immediately clear if the decision had been accepted.</p>
<p>Rizgar Mohammed Amin, the presiding judge of a five-judge tribunal overseeing the Saddam case, has offered to resign, a court official told The Associated Press. The official was speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the case.</p>
<p>The statement came after news reports emerged Friday that Amin would resign. Two judges told AP earlier the reports were not true amid apparent behind-the-scenes efforts to get him to change his mind.</p>
<p>Saddam and seven co-defendants are on trial for the deaths of more than 140 Shiite Muslims after an assassination attempt on him in the town of Dujail in 1982.</p>
<p>The trial began in October and is scheduled to resume Jan. 24. The defendants could face death by hanging if convicted.</p>
<p>The chief judge was dismayed by the way he had been attacked in the media by critics who said he let the proceedings spin out of control, the court official said.</p>
<p>Saddam has often grabbed the spotlight during the trial, railing at the judge and refusing to show up at one session. He also claimed he was tortured and openly prayed in court when the judge would not allow a recess.</p>
<p>U.S. Senate Judiciary Chairman Arlen Specter, R-Pa., met with Amin in late December and told him to take stronger control of the proceeding.</p>
<p>Amin is a Kurd who before the Saddam trial was virtually unknown outside his home region. He heads the panel of five judges who are both hearing the Saddam case and will render a verdict in the trial.</p>

<p>Two lawyers for the defendants in the trial have been killed by gunmen.</p>
