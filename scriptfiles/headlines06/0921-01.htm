<p>A federal judge on Wednesday denied a former Republican congressional candidate&rsquo;s request for a restraining order barring President Bush or Vice President Richard Cheney from bombing Iran or Syria.<br>
<br>Mary Maxwell, 59, of 179 Loudon Road, Apt. 10, Concord, filed a lawsuit Monday against Bush, Cheney and other “unnamed defendants actively engaging in acts of war against Iran and Syria in the guise of the war against terrorism.”<br><br>Maxwell&rsquo;s suit seeks a ruling that the administration lacks legal authority to pre-emptively attack either Iran or Syria without a Congressional declaration of war, and that radioactive fallout from the use of nuclear weapons in any such attack would endanger people around the world, including herself.<br><br>Maxwell was one of two candidates who unsuccessfully challenged six-term Republican incumbent Congressman Charles Bass in the primary election last week.<br><br>Maxwell argues that the Bush administration has claimed broad executive war powers by declaring a “war on terrorism,” and that Congress has shown a disinclination to challenge that authority.<br><br>Her suit cites media reports from various sources, citing Pentagon plans for pre-emptive nuclear strike on Iran, and also reporting on the limited extent of Congressional opposition to the Bush administration&rsquo;s war powers.<br><br>Maxwell argues that the Constitution gives Congress the exclusive authority to declare war. Thus, she argues, Congress must debate and approve or deny the administration&rsquo;s reported plans for pre-emptive nuclear strikes against hostile nations alleged to be developing nuclear or other weapons of mass destruction.<br><br>“It&rsquo;s so stunning for Congress to give away its prerogative, and it&rsquo;s not allowed to do that,” Maxwell said Wednesday, reached by phone at her home. “My complaint as a citizen is that Congress only too willingly is saying, &lsquo;Yeah, we don&rsquo;t care if he bothers to ask us . . . He can do what he likes.&rsquo; ”<br><br>While the Bush administration has yet to respond to Maxwell&rsquo;s suit, U.S. District Court Judge Paul Barbadoro on Wednesday denied her request for an emergency temporary restraining order barring the administration from attacking Iran or Syria.<br><br>“The Motion for Temporary Restraining Order asserts only conclusory arguments. It does not satisfy the plaintiff&rsquo;s duty to demonstrate likelihood of success. Nor does it demonstrate that temporary relief is required to avoid the harm she seeks to prevent,” Barbadoro wrote.<br><br>Maxwell plans to appeal Barbadoro&rsquo;s ruling, she said Wednesday, and she vowed to appeal her suit to the U.S. Supreme Court if she isn&rsquo;t successful in the lower courts.<br><br>There have been similar, previous cases in which people challenged presidential authority in the first Gulf War and before the Iraq war, but courts rejected them because Congress itself wasn&rsquo;t calling any Constitutional fouls, Maxwell said.<br><br>Maxwell said she hopes to avert such a ruling by bringing suit to avoid personal injury from radioactive fallout.<br><br>“Unless I personally can show harm, I don&rsquo;t have standing to bring the case,” she said.
