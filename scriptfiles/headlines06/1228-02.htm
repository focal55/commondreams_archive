Ford, who died on Tuesday at his home in California at age  93, said he would not have gone to war, based on what was known  publicly at the time, said <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/12/27/AR2006122701558_pf.html" target="_new">the report</a> on The Washington Post  Web site on Wednesday.</p>
<p> "I don't think, if I had been president, on the basis of  the facts as I saw them publicly," Ford said, "I don't think I  would have ordered the Iraq war. I would have maximized our  effort through sanctions, through restrictions, whatever, to  find another answer."</p>
<p> In a four-hour tape-recorded interview in July 2004, Ford  "very strongly" disagreed with the justification for the 2003  invasion of Iraq advocated and carried out by key Bush advisers  and veterans of his own administration -- Vice President Dick  Cheney and former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld -- reported  Woodward.</p>
<p> "Rumsfeld and Cheney and the president made a big mistake  in justifying going into the war in Iraq. They put the emphasis  on weapons of mass destruction," Ford said.</p>
<p> "And now, I've never publicly said I thought they made a  mistake, but I felt very strongly it was an error in how they  should justify what they were going to do."</p>
<p> The Bush administration's initial justification for the war  was that Iraq posed a threat because it had stockpiles of  weapons of mass destruction. None were found.</p>
<p> The interview and a subsequent conversation in 2005 were  done for a future book project, although Ford, who became  president in 1974 after Richard Nixon resigned over the  Watergate scandal, said his comments could be published any  time after his death, Woodward wrote.</p>
<p> Woodward's reporting with fellow Washington Post journalist  Carl Bernstein played a key role in uncovering the Watergate  scandal.</p>
<p> Ford was quoted as saying he understood the theory of  "wanting to free people." But the former president said he was  skeptical "whether you can detach that from the obligation  number one, of what's in our national interest."</p>
<p> He added, "And I just don't think we should go hellfire  damnation around the globe freeing people, unless it is  directly related to our own national security."</p>
<p> Woodward said Ford fondly recalled his close working  relationship with Cheney and Rumsfeld, while expressing concern  about the policies they pursued in more recent years.</p>
<p> "He (Cheney) was an excellent chief of staff. First class,"  Ford said. "But I think Cheney has become much more pugnacious"  as vice president.</p>
<p> According to the article, Ford said he agreed with former  Secretary of State Colin Powell's assertion that Cheney  developed a "fever" about the threat of terrorism and Iraq. "I  think that's probably true."</p>
