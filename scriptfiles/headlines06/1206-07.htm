<p>The man picked by President Bush to run the Pentagon admitted yesterday that the US was not winning the war in Iraq and warned that an attack on Iran could backfire with devastating consequences.<P>Robert Gates's sombre and candid assessment stunned Congress, marking a sharp break with his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, who played down the severity of any problems, was dismissive of criticism, and took a much harder line against Iraq's neighbours.<P>The change in tone came at a critical moment, with the US at a crossroads following the Democratic election victory, the resignations of two leading administration hawks, Donald Rumsfeld and John Bolton, and at a time when Washington is in the midst of a fundamental rethink of military strategy.<P>A much-anticipated report from a bipartisan commission, the Iraq Study Group (ISG) will be published today, setting the agenda for that policy review. It is expected to recommend a diplomatic overture to Syria and Iran and a significant reconfiguration of the US's military presence in Iraq.<P>Mr Gates, a former ISG panel member, made it clear that "all options are on the table". When asked if he believed the US was winning, he replied flatly: "No, sir."<P>The former CIA director indicated that he was willing to contemplate a sharp decrease in troop levels and argued that such a pullback did not contradict President Bush's assurances to the Baghdad government last week, when he said: "We are going to stay in Iraq as long as the Iraqis ask us to be there."<P>Mr Gates said: "We are still going to have to have some level of American support ... for the Iraqi military, and that could take quite some time, but it could be with a dramatically smaller number of US forces than are there today."<P>He argued, however, that a hasty and total withdrawal could have disastrous consequences for the region, possibly sucking neighbouring countries into a disastrous conflict.<P>"Developments in Iraq over the next year or two will, I believe, shape the entire Middle East and greatly influence global geopolitics for many years to come," he said, saying US strategy would determine whether "the United States will face a slowly but steadily improving situation in Iraq and in the region or will face the very real risk and possible reality of a regional conflagration."<P>He made it clear that such a conflagration would be accelerated if the US attacked Iran, as some Washington hawks have suggested, as a means of setting back Iran's nuclear programme.<P>"I think that we have seen, in Iraq, that once war is unleashed it becomes unpredictable," he said. In particular, Mr Gates said Iran could strike back by closing off the Gulf to oil shipments, letting loose terrorist attacks in the Middle East, Europe and the US, possibly providing chemical or biological weapons to terrorist groups, and targeting US forces in Iraq.<P>He said an attack on Syria might not provoke as lethal a backlash, but he added "it would have dramatic consequences for us throughout the Middle East in terms of our relationships with a wide range of countries in that area".<P>Mr Gates implicitly criticised Mr Rumsfeld, saying the US had used too few troops in the 2003 Iraq invasion and that more effort should be invested in the hunt for Osama bin Laden, possibly including one senator's suggestion that the reward for the al-Qaida leader's capture should be constantly increased like a state lottery.<P>"A sort of terrorist 'Powerball'?" Mr Gates said. "I'm certainly open to that."<P>Democrats declared themselves relieved at Mr Gates's candour and he is expected to be confirmed easily and quickly by the Senate, allowing him to take over from Mr Rumsfeld in a few weeks.<P>There were signs yesterday that the US military had begun implementing changes the ISG is expected to recommend. Thousands of combat troops have been pulled back from urban patrols and reassigned as advisers to help train the Iraqi army.
