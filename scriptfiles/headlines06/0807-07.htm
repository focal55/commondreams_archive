        Seven anti-war protesters were arrested today after campaigners boarded a 
  plane at a British airport to search for US weapons being transported to 
  Israel.
<p>
  Two men and a woman were in custody after getting on what's understood to be 
  a military plane at Prestwick Airport, Ayrshire, in the early hours.
</p>
<p>
  Police confirmed a further four people - two men and two women - were also 
  arrested at the airport at around 3.30am.
</p>
<p>

  Anti-nuclear campaign group Trident Ploughshares said its activists had 
  boarded a US plane while carrying out an investigation into the British 
  government's involvement in the transport of arms to Israel.
</p>
<p>
  The group named the members involved in this morning's action as Marcus 
  Armstrong, 46, from Milton Keynes, Chris Bluemel, 35, from Southampton, and 
  Angie Zelter, 55, from Norfolk.
</p>
<p>
  Sarah Lasenby, 68, from Oxford, Douglas Shaw, 56, and Jean Oliver, 48, both 
  from Biggar, South Lanarkshire, and Matt Bury, 50, from Somerset, also took 
  part in the investigation, it said.
</p>
<p>
  They were expected to appear in court tomorrow.
</p>
<p>
  Four people were arrested at the airport yesterday after breaking through 
  security fencing and running onto the main runway.

</p>
<p>
  It follows protests last weekend when two flights carrying hazardous 
  material were diverted to RAF Mildenhall in Suffolk.
</p>
<p>
  The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), the body responsible for policing the 
  transit of the flights through civilian airports, said yesterday that it had 
  given permission for the two US flights to stop at Prestwick last weekend 
  but no others.
</p>
<p>
   "We have not issued permission for the carriage of any dangerous cargo 
  to Israel," a spokesman said. 
</p>
<p>
  David Mackenzie, of Trident Ploughshares, said that protesters had accessed 
  the plane by cutting through a perimeter fence at the airport.
</p>

<p>
  They found the military area and a US plane with its door open.
</p>
<p>
  One protester was sitting in the pilot's seat when police arrived.
</p>
<p>
  Mr Mackenzie said: "There was an engineer there and they entered into a 
  conversation with him.
</p>
<p>
   "They were on the plane for around half an hour. Marcus said he was 
  sitting in the pilot's seat when the police arrived."
</p>
<p>

  No weapons were found by the group, who said the plane appeared to be 
  carrying personnel only. Its destination was not known.
</p>
<p>
  Mr Mackenzie said: "We've been told that Prestwick is no longer being 
  used by the US military to transport hazardous materials, but we suspect 
  that this is not true."
</p>
<p>
  He added: "Unless citizens take it into their own hands to find out 
  what's going on then no one will really know."
</p>
<p>
  Strathclyde Police said no damage had been done during what the force 
  described as a peaceful protest.
</p>
<p>
  The use of Prestwick Airport by weapons flights has also been condemned by 
  politicians and members of the Lebanese community living in Scotland.

</p>
<p>
  A series of possible legal actions against the Government's involvement in 
  Israel's Middle East offensive were unveiled by campaigners on Wednesday.
</p>
<p>
  The Foreign and Commonwealth Office said previously that US military planes 
  en route to the conflict zone could land at UK airfields "as long as 
  the proper procedures are followed".
</p>
<p>
  A spokesman for Prestwick Airport said: "Two separate incidents occurred 
  early this morning which resulted in a total of seven people being arrested.
</p>
<p>
  "Glasgow Prestwick Airport is investigating the incidents, as are the 
  authorities, and additional security resources have been in place since we 
  became aware of a similar incident on Sunday morning which led to four 
  arrests.
</p>

<p>
  "We are satisfied that our security measures are working effectively as 
  these people were apprehended very quickly.
</p>
<p>
  "Aviation security is tighter than that of most other industries and 
  security at Glasgow Prestwick Airport is consistent with the measures in 
  place at other major airports in the UK."
