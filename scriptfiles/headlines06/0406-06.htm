The Defense Department&#39;s plan to detonate 700 tons of explosives at the Nevada Test Site is intended to simulate a nuclear blast as part of Pentagon research into development of low-yield nuclear weapons, a science advisory group charged Tuesday.

An explosion rocks the desert floor sending smoke through the area during a training exercise at the Hazardous Material Spill Center simulating a terrorist attact, Wednesday, June 3, 1998, at the Nevada Test Site in Mercury, Nev. Plans for a Pentagon-led experiment that involves detonating 700 tons of explosives in the desert drew criticism from state leaders and a disarmament activist Thursday March 30, 2006. The explosion scheduled for June 2 at the Nevada Test Site is part of an effort to design a weapon that can penetrate solid rock formations in which a country might store nuclear weapons or other weapons of mass destruction.

The Pentagon refused to confirm or deny the claim, made by the Federation of American Scientists, a Washington, D.C.-based liberal policy group opposed to development of    nuclear weapons.   
</p>
<p>But if the charge is verified, debate over the blast seems certain to shift beyond environmental effects on Nevada to international concerns over nuclear weapons proliferation.   
</p>
<p>The federation said it based its statement on a review of Pentagon budget requests since 2002 showing that the blast, scheduled for June 2, would serve as a &#34;low-yield nuclear weapon simulation.&#34; Hans Kristensen, an analyst for the federation, said the Pentagon&#39;s Defense Threat Reduction Agency has carefully ducked the issue of whether the test was nuclear-related.   
</p>
<p>Policy analysts in and out of the Bush administration have suggested that the United States develop low-yield nuclear weapons. In 2001, the National Institute for Public Policy, a conservative nonprofit think tank, said new nuclear warheads should be developed for &#34;bunker busting.&#34;   
</p>
<p>The Bush administration followed in 2002 with its Nuclear Posture Review, which made a similar argument. One of the veterans of the National Institute for Public Policy report, Linton Brooks, became the head of the    National Nuclear Security Administration, which directs nuclear weapons research.   
</p>

<p>According to the Washington Post, a year ago Brooks told Congress that the United States lacked a nuclear warhead capable of destroying &#34;hardened, deeply buried targets.&#34;   
</p>
<p>Despite the enthusiasm for the weapons research, Congress since 2001 has denied funding for such nuclear programs. Last year Congress cut $4 million from the administration&#39;s request to study a nuclear bunker buster, instead supporting study of a conventional weapon that could be used against buried targets.   
</p>
<p>Rep. David Hobson, R-Ohio,    chairman of a key House subcommittee on the weapons issue, said in December that    Congress would not back a ground-penetrating nuclear warhead. The Nuclear Threat Initiative, a nonprofit group working to reduce the likelihood of the use of nuclear weapons, said in November that the Bush administration would go ahead with a test of a mock earth-penetrating nuclear warhead, but with a different name and using Defense rather than Energy Department funding.   
</p>
<p>Kristensen said the test, while non-nuclear, could be used to further development of a nuclear bunker-busting warhead.   
</p>
<p>The test &#34;is about fine-tuning tools for fighting nuclear wars, Kristensen said. The nuclear war fighters are trying to calibrate a low-yield nuclear weapon against a relatively shallow target in limestone.&#34;   
</p>
<p>Kristensen said the goal of the test program    was to find the weakest nuclear weapon that would still achieve the goal of knocking out hardened, underground structures. Lower-yield weapons would spread less radiation and fallout that would affect civilians and troops.   

</p>
<p>Kristensen&#39;s comments came less than a week after James Tegnelia, director of the Threat Reduction Agency, told reporters that the test would send &#34;a mushroom cloud over Las Vegas.&#34; Although the agency quickly disavowed the comment and stressed that the test would be non-nuclear, the comment alarmed political leaders and residents who remember decades of atomic bomb tests at the Nevada Test Site, 65 miles northwest of Las Vegas.   
</p>
<p>Agency spokesmen said the explosion, although large, would not be seen, heard or felt in Las Vegas and would not produce any radioactive dust to blow downwind.   
</p>
<p>Asked Tuesday about the federation&#39;s comments, agency spokesman David Rigby said, &#34;I don&#39;t confirm them. I don&#39;t deny them. I don&#39;t discuss the quality of their information.   
</p>
<p>&#34;This is a test to have better predictive tools to defeating hardened and underground targets,&#34; Rigby said. &#34;It is not a precursor to a nuclear test. It is not a nuclear test.&#34;   

</p>
<p>The June blast &#34;has been redefined over the past several years,&#34; and the goal now is to provide data on how such massive explosions and their ground shocks affect structures in different geologic situations, he said.   
</p>
<p>   Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada is scheduled to meet with Tegnelia on Thursday. Sharyn Stein, a Reid spokeswoman, said    the goal of the test    would be discussed.   
</p>
<p>&#34;Nevadans have heard a lot of frightening rumors about this planned test,&#34; Reid said in a prepared statement. &#34;I look forward to talking with Director Tegnelia and getting accurate information. I&#39;m pleased the director is able to meet with me so quickly, and I hope we&#39;ll be able to settle any concerns about the safety of Divine Strake,&#34; referring to the test.   

</p>
<p>State Sen. Dina Titus, a Democratic candidate for governor and a UNLV professor who has written extensively on Nevada&#39;s history with nuclear weapons testing, said people were concerned about a return of the atomic tests.   
</p>
<p>Past statements from the Bush administration on the need to resume such testing or develop new tactical nuclear weapons don&#39;t reassure people, she said.   
</p>
<p>&#34;All the saber-rattling leads me to fear that they might try to resume testing,&#34; she said. &#34;We won the arms race, so why are we starting it again?   
</p>
<p>&#34;This is a more visceral issue even than Yucca Mountain because of the history of weapons testing. We have to have a strong defense, but I don&#39;t know why we would want to start the arms race again.&#34;</p>
