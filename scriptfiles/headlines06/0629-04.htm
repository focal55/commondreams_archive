in Afghanistan have grown stronger and more sophisticated, and
are directing operations from neighboring Pakistan, a senior
U.S. commander said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>More than four years into the war in Afghanistan, an
operation often overshadowed by the focus on Iraq, the top U.S.
commander there said the Taliban has grown in the south and
reconstituted itself elsewhere. It is displaying better
military command and its leaders remain elusive, he said.</p>

"The fact remains that we're up against an enemy that is
able to operate very effectively on both sides of the border,"
Lt. Gen. Karl Eikenberry said in testimony to U.S. lawmakers.
"There's areas that they're able to stay within and to direct
combat operations against ourselves and against the Afghan
National Army."</p>
<p>Despite growing violence funded, U.S. officials say, by
drug money, NATO will take over military operations in southern
Afghanistan in July, according to Mary Beth Long, the Defense
Department's principal deputy assistant secretary for
international security affairs.</p>
<p>Ultimately, NATO rather than the United States will play
the lead military role throughout Afghanistan. Long did not
offer lawmakers a timeline, saying NATO would take full
responsibility when conditions were "right."</p>
<p>The planned transition to NATO's military leadership will
allow the United States to bring home some of its 23,000 troops
in Afghanistan, a Pentagon spokesman said.</p>
<p>But in his public testimony, which preceded a closed-door
classified briefing to lawmakers, Eikenberry did not discuss
troop levels or offer a timeline for their drawdown.</p>
<p>While the U.S. military had disclosed plans in December to
cut its contingent from 19,000 to about 16,500 this spring,
troop levels remain higher. Including troops from other
countries, the coalition force on the ground numbers 28,000,
Eikenberry said.</p>
<p>Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld said U.S. troop levels
may continue to climb.</p>

<p>"The number of troops that we have there and that other
coalition countries have there are, in fact, going up," he told
reporters on Wednesday. "As NATO took over the north, took over
the west, is now in the process of taking over the south, they
have actually increased the number of troops."</p>
<p>But Democrats challenged U.S. plans and operations in the
face of a re-emerging Taliban.</p>
<p>"I do not see a long-term comprehensive strategy from the
administration," said Rep. Ike Skelton  of Missouri, the top
Democrat on the committee. "And if one exists, it is not being
clearly communicated to Congress, the American people or the
people of Afghanistan."
