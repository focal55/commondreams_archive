<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><P>In deciding Thursday not to challenge California Sen. Dianne Feinstein in 
the June Democratic primary, anti-war activist Cindy Sheehan said she felt she 
could help the anti-war effort more by highlighting who she is  --  a mother 
grieving a son killed in Iraq  --  than by becoming a politician. 
<P>Sheehan gained international attention in August as she waited outside 
President Bush's vacation ranch in Crawford, Texas, for him to explain what 
"noble cause" her son, Casey, died for in Iraq in 2004. Bush, who had described 
the war in those terms, never showed, as his staff said he had already met with 
Sheehan shortly after Casey died.  
<P>In the weeks that followed, nationwide vigils supporting Sheehan 
re-energized the anti-war movement, while conservative critics say a host of 
other left-leaning causes hijacked her notoriety and diluted its effect.  
<P>Sheehan, formerly of Vacaville and now a Berkeley resident, said Thursday 
she worried that by running for office she'd sacrifice the emotional bond she 
has created  --  at least with some Americans. 
<P>"Some people don't agree with my politics, but at least they agree with my 
heart," said Sheehan, 48, wearing a pink piece of tape with "2,260"  --  the 
number of U.S. casualties in Iraq  --  on her shirt. "And if I'd gone into the 
(political) arena right now, a lot of that would have changed." 
<P>"I felt that putting pressure on (Feinstein) from the outside would be 
more effective than working from the inside,'' Sheehan said. 

<P>Instead, Sheehan promised to be a "thorn in the side of (Feinstein) and 
anyone who is not stridently working for peace." 
<P>Sheehan will barnstorm California and the rest of the nation for anti-war 
candidates  --  whose peace credentials will be judged by her trusted advisers 
such as the liberal Institute for Policy Studies think tank, Progressive 
Democrats of America, and Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich. She said it didn't matter 
whether a candidate was "left or right as long as they're against the war." 
<P>"It's not enough to say that one is critical of the war in Iraq," Sheehan 
said, calling for voters to oppose "pro-war Democrats" in the upcoming 
elections. "If an elected official voted for the war, votes for the funding of 
the war, and doesn't call for an immediate withdrawal of the troops, then that 
official is 'pro-war' no matter what he or she says." 
<P>Sheehan said that list includes Feinstein, who voted for authorizing the 
use of force in Iraq and will not support calls to immediately bring the troops 
home.  
<P>Feinstein has defended voting for the 2002 resolution authorizing the use 
of force in Iraq if the country refused to comply with U.N. weapons inspectors, 
saying she was misled by the Bush administration at the time of the vote.  
<P>Now, with troops committed in Iraq, Feinstein said it is more responsible 
to quickly turn the defense of Iraq over to Iraqis, then bring U.S. troops 
home.  
<P>A challenge against Feinstein, the former San Francisco mayor first 
elected to the Senate in 1992, is daunting for any candidate, said Mark 
DiCamillo, director of California's Field Poll. 
<P>A November Field Poll found that 82 percent of respondents who identified 
themselves as political liberals were "inclined to vote" for Feinstein, as were 
63 percent of "moderates" and 30 percent of "conservatives." Overall, the poll 
found that respondents supported Feinstein's re-election by a 56 percent to 37 
percent margin. 
<P>Still, Sheehan said several members of California's Congressional 
delegation  --  whom she declined to name  --  told her that Feinstein's office 
has pressured them in recent days to discourage the activist from seeking 
office. 
<P>"That's absolutely untrue," said Feinstein campaign manager Kam Kuwata. 
"No one has pressured anyone." 
<P>Representatives of other members of California's delegation who are close 
to Sheehan, including Rep. Lynn Woolsey, D-Petaluma, and Rep. Barbara Lee, 
D-Oakland, say Feinstein did not pressure them to try to keep Sheehan out of 
the race, adding they supported Sheehan's decision to bypass a Democratic 
primary campaign. 
<P>Sheehan said her decision wasn't influenced by the state's other 
Democratic senator, Barbara Boxer, who urged Sheehan earlier this week not to 
challenge Feinstein, saying it might actually hurt her anti-war cause.  
<P>Boxer, one of 23 senators who voted against the 2002 resolution 
authorizing the use of force in Iraq, applauded Sheehan's decision Thursday, 
saying, "There can be no higher cause than a mother who has lost a son working 
night and day to ensure that others do not have to suffer the same way."  
<P>Sheehan said she'll be supporting anti-war candidates in Texas, Illinois 
and California over the next few months and is slated to address the European 
Union parliament in March. During the Easter holiday, she's encouraging 
supporters to join her for another vigil outside Bush's ranch. And she'd like 
to visit the spot in Iraq where her son died.  
<P>A peace conference is being planned for Crawford in August. Possibly 
joining her in Texas will be Venezuelan president Hugo Chavez, who embraced 
Sheehan during her recent visit to Venezuela for the World Social Forum.  
<P>Critics as well as some Sheehan supporters have said that her appearance 
with Chavez  --  a frequent Bush critic who has called the U.S. invasion of 
Iraq an act of terrorism  --  had hurt the anti-war movement and Sheehan's 
credibility. Responded Sheehan: "George Bush keeps saying, 'Democracy, 
democracy, democracy.' He has to recognize every democracy, not just the ones 
that are friendly to him." 
<P>Sheehan made headlines again last week when she was arrested in the House 
of Representatives chamber before Bush's State of the Union speech for wearing 
an anti-war T-shirt. The Capitol police later dropped charges and apologized to 
her for the arrest.
