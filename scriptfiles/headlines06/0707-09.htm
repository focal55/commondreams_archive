        <p> At least 20 Palestinians were believed dead, dozens more were wounded and an Israeli soldier was killed yesterday as Israel moved in to reoccupy a swath of the northern Gaza Strip for the first time since its forces and settlers pulled out 11 months ago. </p>

        
          
          
            <p>
  The incursion precipitated the heaviest fighting since Israeli forces 
  converged on Gaza eight days ago in response to the abduction of the 
  19-year-old army corporal Gilad Shalit and the firing of Qassam rockets.
</p>
<p>
  In the northern Gaza Strip, six people were killed and dozens wounded in 
  what the army said had been three separate aerial strikes aimed at gunmen. 
</p>
<p>
  Elsewhere, Palestinian sources said that eight people, including civilians, 
  were among victims of separate attacks, at least one of whom had been killed 
  by an unmanned aerial drone. Five Palestinian militants were later killed in 
  two missile strikes on cars. 

</p>
<p>
  The Israeli soldier died after being shot by a Palestinian sniper in a Beit 
  Lahiya house taken over by his unit. Said Siyam, the Palestinian Interior 
  Minister and Hamas leader, last night called on security service personnel 
  fulfill their "duty to stand up to this aggression and cowardly Zionist 
  invasion". 
</p>
<p>
  Amir Peretz, Israel's Defence Minister, insisted yesterday: "We have no 
  intention of drowning in the Gaza swamp." He said later: "Return 
  Gilad alive and healthy, stop firing rockets and we will return our soldiers 
  to their bases." 
</p>
<p>
  Arab states yesterday called on the UN Security Council to demand that 
  Israeli forces immediately withdraw from Gaza, but France and the US 
  criticised their proposed resolution as unbalanced.
</p>
<p>
  With little sign of a breakthrough in the continuing international 
  diplomatic efforts to broker a solution to the crisis, the fighting between 
  a heavily armoured Israeli incursion force with air support and militants in 
  the northern Strip was the most serious since the disengagement from Gaza 
  ordered by Ariel Sharon last August.
</p>

<p>
  Two other Hamas gunmen, among many who converged on the area with anti-tank 
  and other missiles, were killed in an earlier incident in northern Gaza. And 
  two Palestinians were killed in a separate Israeli air strike outside the 
  southern Gaza town of Khan Yunis. The Israeli military said that both had 
  been militants seeking to attack its forces while Palestinian sources said 
  that one had been a civilian.
</p>
<p>
  But the heaviest machine gun fire &shy; and most casualties &shy; were in western 
  Beit Lahiya as Israeli forces, with tanks, armoured vehicles, drones and 
  helicopter gunships, sought to secure control of the north-west corner of 
  the Gaza Strip, a sector bounded by five kilometres of the northern border 
  and about the same length of the Mediterranean coast. The area includes the 
  ruins of the three northernmost former Jewish settlements abandoned last 
  August and the Atatra district of Beit Lahiya. 
</p>
<p>
  Although most of the dead were militants, one civilian who was killed was 
  Mohammed al-Atta, 25. His uncle, Abdul Ahmed al-Atta, 34, a taxi driver, 
  said he had been at home with his nephew, wife and children when a tank 
  fired at the house. Mr Atta, his shirt caked with blood from carrying his 
  nephew to the ambulance, said: "They targeted our house; there was 
  shooting and then I saw my nephew on the ground. There was a tank 100 metres 
  away. We are civilians and there was no resistance in the area at the time."</p>
<p>

  He added that the Israeli forces had entered the area at about 7am, 
  advancing through orchards rather than using the main streets. 
</p>
<p>
  Mr Atta said there had been a long delay after he called an ambulance, which 
  he understood was because Palestinian liaison officers had been unable to 
  co-ordinate safe passage with the Israeli military for emergency vehicles 
  through the area and said he was obliged to telephone a friend in the Red 
  Cross before the co-ordination could take place. 
</p>
<p>
  His nephew died on the way to hospital. The army said it had not been able 
  to verify the incident. A group of relatives and friends stormed the 
  ambulancemen's quarters shouting that they had received calls telling them 
  that ambulances had still not arrived to pick up two other dead neighbours 
  and several wounded. 
</p>
<p>
  There was no immediate confirmation of the civilian deaths in Atatra. 
  Ambulances were forced to wait near the American School in Atatra for 
  clearance as heavy machine-gun fire from Israeli armoured vehicles, as well 
  as semi-automatic gunfire from militants, sounded across the district. 
</p>
<p>
  Later, mourners for the militants who marched through Gaza City were told 
  through a loudspeaker that there would be a "response from Hamas to 
  what Israel is doing."

</p>
<p>
  With Israel still rejecting any suggestion of a prisoner exchange to secure 
  the release of Cpl Shalit, the captured soldier's father Noam said: "In 
  the end, it will be necessary to pay a price for Gilad's freedom. I don't 
  understand why the government is delaying negotiations on this price."
