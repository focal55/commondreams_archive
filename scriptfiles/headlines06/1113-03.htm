Amy Goodman is the host of the radio program "Democracy Now!," which offers an alternative perspective of political news that critics of the mainstream media say is ignored.</p>
<p>"When the press acts as a conveyor belt for the lies of government, the lies take lives," said Goodman, whose hourlong program airs locally on KCBX-FM 90.1 at noon Monday through Friday and on KCPR-FM 91.3 at 9 a.m.</p>
<p>Goodman is noted for offering perspectives from voices of anti-war activists and political experts not often heard in the mainstream media and for criticizing corporate media for allegedly funneling lies from the federal government.</p>

<p>About 360 people contributed $30 or $100 apiece for tickets, raising nearly $14,000 to help pay for the local broadcast of "Democracy Now!," according to KCBX program director Guy Rathbun.</p>
<p>War veterans, college students and other local residents listened to anecdotes from Goodman&#146;s interviews with grassroots leaders, activists and international journalists who have been affected directly by U.S. foreign policy.</p>
<p>A brief book signing followed her talk at the San Luis Obispo Veterans Memorial Building.</p>
<p>Goodman&#146;s career has taken her many places, including Crawford, Texas, where President Bush vacations. There, she held signs supporting anti-war activists.</p>
<p>She&#146;s also been to the riot-filled streets of East Timor and spent time with families who lost relatives in the Iraq war.</p>
<p>Among her most notable experience as an interviewer was the story of Cindy Sheehan &#151; a woman whose son was killed in Iraq in 2004 and who since became a liberal political activist.</p>

<p>Shortly after her son was killed, Sheehan gained national attention through the mainstream media by camping outside Bush&#146;s Texas ranch to protest the presence of U.S. troops in Iraq and has continued her activism since.</p>
<p>Goodman also shared stories Sunday about her meetings with families who were angry about their relatives being killed at war.</p>
<p>The stories were key to Goodman&#146;s message, which is to pressure the mainstream media to criticize people in power.</p>
<p>"It is essential to the functioning of a democratic society that we be independent, that we have the discussions, that we hold those in power accountable," Goodman said. "We have to challenge the media to stop acting as a conveyor belt for the lies of the administration."</p>
<p>"Whoever is in the leadership isn&#146;t as important as you, the people, in this room. You will determine what happens," Goodman said.</p>
