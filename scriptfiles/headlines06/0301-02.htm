<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><P>San Francisco's supervisors jumped into national politics Tuesday, passing 
a resolution asking the city's Democratic congressional delegation to seek the 
impeachment of President Bush for failing to perform his duties by leading the 
country into war in Iraq, eroding civil liberties and engaging in other 
activities the board sees as transgressions. 
<P>The supervisors, in voting 7-3 for the resolution,  made it likely that 
San Francisco again will become grist for radio and TV talk shows. The city has 
appeared in the national media spotlight recently for voters' passage in 
November of a nonbinding measure banning military recruiters from public high 
schools and for Supervisor Gerardo Sandoval's recent comment on a Fox News show 
that the United States doesn't need a military. 
<P>Supervisor Chris Daly, one of the most progressive members of the board, 
sponsored the resolution, which also calls for the impeachment of Vice 
President Dick Cheney. Daly said the measure is justified in light of the 
administration's case for and handling of the war in Iraq, the federal 
government's inadequate response to Hurricane Katrina and recent revelations 
about a domestic wiretapping program. 
<P>"I think the case is clear, and I think it's appropriate for us to weigh 
in," Daly said. 
<P>Speaking in opposition to the resolution, Supervisor Michela Alioto-Pier 
said, "I don't think that we need to be calling for the impeachment of 
President Bush and Vice President Cheney, as much as we may not like them ... 
and as much as we don't like the policies that they put forward." 
<P>Joining Alioto-Pier in voting against the resolution were Supervisors Sean 
Elsbernd and Sophie Maxwell. Supervisor Jake McGoldrick was absent. 
<P>Mayor Gavin Newsom didn't want to pick up the impeachment drumbeat, but he 
offered a sarcastic response when asked his position on the nonbinding 
resolution. 
<P>"It's probably going to shatter the status quo in this country when it 
passes,'' he said with a smile. "I imagine, immediately, Congress will probably 
convene into session and begin impeachment proceedings.'' 

<P>Still, Newsom said he hasn't decided whether he will sign the legislation. 
<P>"On the list of 1 to 3,000, it's not even on that list of priorities for 
me to sign a resolution  --  that will have no force and effect  --  talking 
about impeachment,'' said Newsom, a partisan Democrat and frequent critic of 
the president's policies. 
<P>In sending the resolution to Bay Area members of Congress, the supervisors 
addressed a frustrated group that is tired of being in the minority. 
<P>"Real change in the direction of our country will come about when the 
Republicans no longer control the executive and legislative branches,'' said 
Rep. Tom Lantos of San Mateo, whose district includes the southwestern corner 
of San Francisco. "We need to take control of the House, elect more Democratic 
senators and take control of the White House in 2008.''  
<P>The House Democratic leader, Rep. Nancy Pelosi, who represents much of San 
Francisco, was asked about impeaching Bush during a  January town meeting at 
Marina Middle School.  
<P>Pelosi, poised to become the first female House speaker if the Democrats 
win control in November's election, repeated Tuesday what she told her 
constituents: "Win the election. Then you can change the policy of our 
country.'' 
<P>Asked if San Francisco was setting itself up again as the target of 
talk-show barbs, she said, "It's a democratic society. The Board of Supervisors 
does what it does.'' 
<P>Sen. Dianne Feinstein, a former San Francisco mayor, wouldn't comment 
directly on the idea of impeaching Bush. But she noted that as a member of the 
Senate Intelligence Committee, she has been frustrated trying to get 
information about the secret National Security Agency eavesdropping program. 
<P>"We're in the minority. We press and press, and all we get is 
stonewalled,'' said Feinstein, who is running for re-election in November. 
<P>The supervisors' vote might not generate the ridicule one would expect 
from conservative talk radio, said Michael Harrison, editor of Talkers 
Magazine. 
<P>"I don't think the vote will be a joke because George Bush is in more 
trouble with his conservative backers than ever, particularly talk radio 
hosts,'' said Harrison, whose magazine covers the talk radio business. 
<P>Many conservatives are angry at the president over such issues as the 
planned takeover of operations at six major U.S. ports by a company controlled 
by the government of Dubai, one of the United Arab Emirates, the secret spying 
and the bungled handling of Cheney's shooting of a hunting companion.  
<P>And Newsom wasn't worried the board's action would hurt San Francisco's 
reputation. 
<P>"I don't think it damages the city in any significant ways," he said. "I 
think the things we're ridiculed about ... are some of the proudest moments in 
the city in terms of advancing our values  --  and they tend to transcend our 
borders.''
