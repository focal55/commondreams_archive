<p>US President George W. Bush's own church has called for the withdrawal
of troops from Iraq and is urging direct action to end the war. <br>

<br>
Writes Mark Schoeff Jr: United Methodist Church leaders helped launch a
week of protest and civil disobedience against the war in Iraq by
signing a declaration of peace in the capital, urging President Bush to
pull US troops out of the country.<br>
<br>
The Declaration of Peace, signed on 21 September 2006, is described as
a call for nonviolent action to end the war in Iraq. The Washington DC
event was one of 350 staged nationwide to promote the peace initiative.<br>
<br>
More than 500 groups, almost half of them faith organizations, are
involved in the declaration of peace effort, which recently retired
Bishop Susan Morrison said includes "acts of moral witness to seek a
new course for our country."<br>
<br>
By signing the peace document in front of the White House, the United
Methodists and other protesters also hope to influence congressional
races in November 2006 by forcing candidates to outline where they
stand on the war.<br>
<br>
Speakers at the Washington DC rally accusing the President of lying
about Iraq possessing weapons of mass destruction and launching what
they called an illegal offensive.<br>
<br>
"Our demand as a movement is to end the war now," said Bishop Morrison.
The declaration calls the situation in Iraq "an endless fire consuming
lives, resources and the fragile possibilities of peace."<br>

<br>
Thirty-four protesters, attempting to deliver the peace statement to
Bush in an act of civil disobedience, were arrested and charged with
disorderly conduct. None of the United Methodist protesters
participated in that portion of the day's activity.<br>
<br>
The Declaration of Peace initiative provides a way for the faithful to
vent their anger about Iraq, Morrison said. "There are a lot of
frustrated United Methodists out there who don't know where to channel
it," she added.<br>
<br>
United Methodist clergy attending the recent 2006 International
Clergywomen's Consultation in Chicago signed the declaration to "call
to end this war" and made a commitment to take action to translate the
call into a concrete plan for peace.<br>
<br>
Jim Winkler, top executive of the United Methodist Board of Church and
Society, said that protesting the war is similar to the church's work
to promote other social movements. The church took prophetic positions
on civil rights, women's rights and nuclear disarmament before Congress
acted, he noted.<br>
<br>
"It has taken time for Congress to catch up," Winkler said. "We may be seeing another example of that."<br>
<br>
Staff members of the denomination's social advocacy agency have been
meeting with congressional staff members on a weekly basis regarding
policy toward Iraq. Political leaders on Capitol Hill have been divided
on the Bush administration's policy, with some calling for a timetable
for withdrawal and others urging a staying of the course.<br>

<br>
"You see more and more Republicans who are uncomfortable with the
position of 'stay the course,'" said Mark Harrison, director of the
board's Peace with Justice programme.<br>
<br>
But the White House asserts that Iraq would collapse if US troops leave
prematurely, potentially leading to a full-blown civil war.<br>
<br>
United Methodist leaders argue that the long insurgency in Iraq, which
has resulted in the deaths of thousands Americans and Iraqis, is proof
that U.S. involvement is misguided.<br>
<br>
"Iraq is in a civil war right now because we're there," Winkler said.<br>
<br>
Morrison agreed. "We just exacerbate what's going on." She disputed
critics who claim that war protesters undermine US troops and sap their
morale.<br>
<br>
"We care deeply about the troops," she said. "We're proud of their commitment. We want them safe. We want them home."<br>

<br>
Within individual United Methodist congregations, however, some members
do not agree with the way the anti-war movement is articulating its
opposition.<br>
<br>
Differences of opinion must be respected, said the Rev Dean Snyder,
senior minister of Foundry United Methodist Church in Washington. Such
divisions have come up throughout Christian history.<br>
<br>
"It's part of our discernment process of truth," he said. "But that
does not change the fact that church leaders are put in positions of
prophetic responsibility."
