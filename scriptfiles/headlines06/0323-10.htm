NEW YORK <b>-</b> In his provocative documentary "Why We Fight", director Eugene Jarecki asks whether 
Washington's foreign policy is overly preoccupied with the idea of military supremacy, and if 
the military has become too important in U.S. life. <br>

Jarecki interviews subjects from across the political spectrum, including Wilton Sekzer, a 
retired New York police officer whose son died in the Sep. 11 attack on the World Trade 
Centre; Bill Kristol, editor of the neo-conservative Weekly Standard; Gore Vidal, a 
prominent author and liberal commentator; James Roche, secretary of the U.S. Air Force; 
and U.S. pilots identified as Fuji and Tooms, who dropped the first bombs over Baghdad 
when the Iraq war broke in 2003.
<br><br>
Following are excerpts from a recent interview IPS conducted with the award-winning 
filmmaker.
<br><br>
Q: Tell us why you chose this title for your film.
<br><br>
A: Actually, this is the title of a series of films made during World War II by the legendary 
director Frank Capra. It seems to me that in the past 60 years, the reasons for American 
war have changed and become far more complicated for everyday people to understand.
<br><br>
The film asks the question, why we fight. I cannot say that it provides an answer, because 
it wasn't really my goal to provide a single answer. It was my goal to bring together voices 
from a wide range of experts and the insiders, people touched by American war who could 
become a kind of chorus of concern looking more deeply at the issues involved and the 
stakes implied than customarily happens in our shallow news media outlets.
<br><br>

It looks at today's critical situation in Iraq and it's impossible to look at the history of 
American war over the past half century without naturally being reminded of the crisis in 
which we now find ourselves.
<br><br>
Q: Have you faced any problems in terms of distribution?
<br><br>
A: If you are a filmmaker trying to cover a politically sensitive subject in the United States, 
America has suffered such a degradation of our open media system in recent years, such a 
shift away from the values of a democratic society, that problems arise long before the 
distribution phase. At the very start, the struggle to get financing for a film like this in the 
United States would have proved immediately prohibitive. So we moved overseas to the 
BBC, to Canada, to France and Germany, to countries whose media systems are far more 
open than ours, and in many ways shame ours.
<br><br>
Q: Has the movie been shown in Iraq?
<br><br>
A: It has not been shown in Iraq. There has been a movement by the British forces 
television to show the film to their own troops serving in Iraq, but it has not been shown in 
Iraq.
<br><br>
Q: In the movie, you have interviews with U.S. weapon manufacturers and footage of 
weapons manufacturing sites. How did you manage to get access to those sites?
<br><br>
A: Well, you know, I worked very hard to reach out to people all across the spectrum, and 
when you are making a film about war, you are dealing with people at all levels. And in 
order to secure access to these people, in general one had to go through the Pentagon.
We were involved in a very serious inquiry and not in an ambush, a kind of tough love for 
America and the American story.
<br><br>
Q: You highlighted the speech of U.S. Pres. Dwight D. Eisenhower (1953-1961) in which he 
expresses his deep concern over the "military-industrial complex". Do you agree with 
those who would rather describe this phenomenon as "military-industrial-prison-media 
complex"?
<br><br>
A: Yes, unfortunately, what Eisenhower is talking about is the concern that the interests of 
corporations have been placed ahead of the interests of the people. That can take many 
forms, whether it's military-industrial or pharmaceutical or media. There are so many 
industries in America that can have undue, unwarranted influences on the affairs of the 
state.

<br><br>
In many ways, Eisenhower is simply noting the rise of special interests in the United States. 
[But] the military-industrial complex has a special distinction as a special interest. The 
enormity of its business and the way in which it operates it makes more difficult in times 
of threats [when] you can insulate military-industrial special interests from the kind of 
oversight and review that others feel might be needed. So the military-industrial complex 
is a sort of favoured nation among special interests.
<br><br>
Q: You focused on the invasion of Iraq. How do you view the recent developments 
regarding Iran's nuclear programme and the threats Tehran is facing?
<br><br>
A: I think the concern of course is to what extent the conflict with Iran is another very 
unfortunate side effect of the calamitous decision on the war in Iraq. You may remember 
that U.S. policymakers asserted from the start that it would be what they called a 
"cakewalk". Having gotten rid of Saddam [Hussein], upbeat people would be dancing in the 
streets, and the country would immediately take a new shape. All of those dreams of 
course have collapsed. What we now face is a situation of intense chaos. By unseating 
[Hussein], the United States in many ways liberated the Shia in Iraq and the 
fundamentalists in Iran who have far more in common with each other.
<br><br>
Q: It is very interesting that in the film you used the footage of [current U.S. Defence 
Secretary Donald] Rumsfeld's meeting with Saddam Hussein in 1983, when he was the 
special envoy of Pres. Ronald Reagan.
<br><br>
A: You can't study the history of the current war without following the roots all the way 
back to the overthrow of Mossedeq (1953) in the interests of British Petroleum. But along 
the way, there is no way to ignore Ayatollah Khomeini [in Iran]. Along the way, there is no 
way to ignore Saddam Hussein. No way to ignore that the United States and Saddam 
Hussein had reasons to ally with each other. The question is, what is it about U.S. foreign 
policy that makes us these kinds of bedfellows, such that we have to conduct war to 
unseat them?
<br><br>
Q: Are you hopeful about the realisation of these dreams and aspirations for taking back 
the republic?
<br><br>
A: I don't know, but I think the hope for America to be a democratic republic is the 
founding hope. That has always been a work in progress. And there always come 
challenges. [The communist-hunting Senator Joseph] McCarthy was a challenge, today is a 
challenge, slavery was a challenge, the death of the Native Americans was a challenge, the 
eugenics movement before the Second World War was a challenge, the Depression was a 
challenge.
<br><br>
There have been so many challenges. We have a nation of leaders who cared deeply about 
this country. But now we face a situation where the stakes are so high that what I would 
hope to see is that Americans would look into the streets of New Orleans, into the streets 
of Falluja, and they would see a world that really is not viable. They would see a platform 
of ideas that are shortsighted, not holistic in nature. These are platforms of ideas that do 
not meet the needs of everyday people in the shrinking world. And so the question is: Will 
Americans come to see that with sufficient vigour to have the kind of impact that people 
need to have on policy and democracy?
