For several months before the war, government agencies didn't consult each other on what they were doing because their work was classified.</p>
<p>The report is a chronological review of American contracting and purchasing efforts starting in the summer of 2002 for post-invasion relief and rebuilding.</p>
<p>"It is a story of mistakes made, plans poorly conceived or overwhelmed by ongoing violence," said Sen. Susan Collins (news, bio, voting record), R-Maine. "And of waste, greed and corruption that drained dollars that should have been used to build schools, improve the electrical grid, and repair the oil infrastructure."</p>
<p>The report by the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction, Stuart W. Bowen Jr., is being presented Wednesday before the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, which Collins chairs.</p>
<p>The 140-page report starts the chronology noting there was limited coordination of contract and purchasing efforts from the summer of 2002 to January 2003. The war started in March 2003.</p>
<p>"This lack of coordination in early planning was attributable, in part, to the fact that much of the activity was classified," it said.</p>
<p>The report's recommendations include setting up single contracting procedures in such environments, setting up deployable systems ahead of time and testing them, designating a single agency to coordinate all contract activities in theater.</p>
<p>This report is the latest by Bowen in a number of days that detailed project delays and cost overruns in Iraq.</p>

<p>Bowen also said in his quarterly report released late Monday that a long tradition of corruption among Iraqi officials also hampers progress.</p>
<p>Corruption is "a virtual pandemic in Iraq," threatening rebuilding efforts, international aid and citizen confidence needed for a fledgling democracy, he said.</p>
<p>He cited an Iraqi official who estimated that corruption costs the country $4 billion a year, as well as a recent survey indicating a third of Iraqis polled had paid a bribe to get products or services in the past 12 months and that they had a "core mistrust" of the army and police.</p>
<p>"Unless reforms are put in place, corruption may jeopardize the political stability of the new government," said an audit included in the quarterly report.</p>
<p>It also said that teams being created to help local government leaders out in the provinces with the next phase of reconstruction don't have enough security or supplies or staff.</p>
<p>"The deteriorating security situation has had a particularly deleterious effect on the establishment of the U.S. provincial reconstruction teams," Bowen said.</p>
<p>Bowen's office was created by Congress and reports administratively to the departments of State and Defense as well as writing a quarterly report to Congress.</p>
