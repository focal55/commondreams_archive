<p>GENEVA - The United States on Tuesday reasserted its right to develop weapons for use in outer space to protect its military and commercial satellites and ruled out any global negotiations on a new treaty to limit them.</p><p>In a speech to the Conference on Disarmament, a senior State Department arms control official insisted that such weapons systems would be purely defensive.</p><p>Washington sees no need for negotiations to prevent an arms race in space as a 40-year-old international treaty banning weapons of mass destruction in space remains adequate, he said.</p><p>John Mohanco, deputy director of the office of multilateral, nuclear and security affairs, said the United States faced a threat of attacks from the earth or from other countries' spacecraft. He did not name any potential attackers.</p><p>"As long as the potential for such attacks remains, our government will continue to consider the possible role that space-related weapons may play in protecting our assets," he told the United Nations-backed forum.</p><p>"For our part, the United States does not have any weapons in space, nor do we have plans to build such weapons," he said.</p><p>The White House is due to announce a new space policy this month, the first overhaul in a decade. Some U.S. experts have said it will underscore the Pentagon's determination to protect its existing space assets and maintain dominance of outer space.</p><p>The United States and Britain are under pressure to agree to global negotiations on space at the 65-member Geneva forum, where they remain virtually alone in opposing them.</p><p>Washington argues a treaty banning production of nuclear bomb-making fissile material should be the forum's next goal.</p><p>Last week, China and Russia warned that space-based weapons would pose a threat as great as weapons of mass destruction and pointed to gaps in existing international law. The two powers also back fissile talks under a wider agenda including space.</p><p>LION'S SHARE</p><p>The United States -- which has the "lion's share of assets in outer space" -- remains committed to the peaceful use of space by all nations, according to Mohanco.</p><p>"There is no -- repeat, no -- problem in outer space for arms control to solve," he said, citing "unprecedented international cooperation" in civil and commercial space activities, including among former Cold War foes.</p><p>A 1967 U.N. treaty bans weapons of mass destruction from space, but some experts believe the United States would not shy away from withdrawing from the pact.</p><p>In 2002, it pulled out of the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) treaty to begin deploying a missile defense shield.</p><p>Mohanco vowed all U.S. activities in the exploration and use of outer space would comply with international law.</p><p>But a new pact to ban anti-satellite weapons or other space-related weapon systems would be impossible, given the problems of defining what it covered, because any space object had an inherent "dual-use potential", meaning it could be used for civilian or military purposes, he said.
