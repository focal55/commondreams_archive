elections  --  but not because of trendy new campaigning tactics like uploading 
videos on YouTube or posting candidates' profiles on MySpace. Instead, 
18-to-29-year-olds were compelled to vote because of one of the oldest media 
tactics: Somebody asked them, often in person.

Of course, many were angry with the direction President Bush has taken the 
country and wanted change, according to a bipartisan exit poll from a youth 
voter organization. Put the two factors together  --  and add the growing 
influence of new media tools  --  and some analysts say a generation of young 
voters is solidifying into a Democratic voting bloc.  
<P>"The 2006 elections show that Republican campaigns must mobilize their 
base of young voters to win," said GOP pollster Ed Goeas, who conducted the 
poll of 500 18-to-29-year-olds with Democratic pollster Celinda Lake for Young 
Voter Strategies in Washington, D.C. The nonpartisan organization is a project 
of the Graduate School of Political Management at George Washington University. 

<P>Tuesday "proved that young voters can and will be a force in 
elections," Goeas said. "Of the 28 seats in the House of Representatives that 
changed hands so far, 22 were won by less than 2 percent of the vote, 18 by 
5,000 or less votes, and 4 by less than 1,000 votes."  
<P>A key factor in wooing these 42 million people: campaigns that reached out 
and talked to them. Forty-six percent of the young people in the survey said 
they were contacted by a candidate or a campaign.  
<P>Of those contacted, 28 percent said they received a phone call, and 22 
percent got an in-person visit. Only 3 percent received a text message on their 
cell phone, and 7 percent were contacted through a social networking site like 
MySpace or Facebook.  

<P>"Reaching young people is not rocket science," said Dave Rosenfeld, 
organizing director of the nonpartisan New Voters Project, which registered 
75,000 voters and ran outreach programs on 80 college campuses in 15 states.  
<P>Voter turnout increased dramatically Tuesday, Rosenfeld said, in precincts 
with the large college-student populations his project targeted. 
<P>"Campaigns are learning that they ignore youth at their own peril," 
Rosenfeld said.

</font>More peril could await Republicans if they don't reach more young voters 
soon. According to CNN exit polls, 60 percent of voters under 30 cast ballots 
for Democrats. Seventy-eight percent of young people who vote for the same 
party in three elections in a row are likely to remain a member of that party 
through adulthood, said pollster Goeas. 
<P>"We lost (the youth vote) in 2004 by 11 percent," Goeas said of 
Republicans. Now, with that number doubling this year, according to early exit 
polls, Goeas worried that a generation of the electorate is growing up as 
reliable Democrats. 
<P>According to the bipartisan Goeas-Lake exit polls, 40 percent of young 
voters said they identify with Democrats, 30 percent with Republicans and 23 
percent with independents. However, half reported that they voted for 
Democrats, and 35 percent said they cast ballots for Republicans.  
<P>Despite Tuesday's swing, Democrats shouldn't take young people for 
granted, said Molly Moon Neitzel, executive director of Music for America in 
San Francisco. The organization connected with 3 million young voters this 
election cycle through MySpace, text messaging and its volunteers, who 
encouraged voting at the 1,000 concerts it sponsors annually.  
<P>"If they (Democrats) don't do something with the power we gave them last 
night, we won't vote for them in 2008," Neitzel said Wednesday. "The jury is 
still out on Democrats." 
<P>Forty-three percent of young people responding to the Young Voter 
Strategies poll said the most important issue to them when deciding whom to 
vote for was the war in Iraq. They wanted Congress to address education, the 
expense of college and the economy. Sixty percent had an unfavorable impression 
of President Bush. 
<P>"The main thing people wanted was change," said Kathleen Barr with Young 
Voter Strategies. 
<P>But while Music for America sent out 30,000 text messages Monday to remind 
young people of the election and point them to their polling places, Neitzel 
and others said the jury also is still out on the power of new media techniques 
that surfaced in this campaign.  
<P>"The 2006 election was an experimental one for new media," said Peter 
Leyden, director of the New Politics Institute, a liberal San Francisco think 
tank that focuses on the intersection of new media tools and politics. "But 
even if it wasn't fully integrated into campaigns, what things like YouTube did 
was energize and excite young people about politics."
