<p>MILWAUKEE - Senior military leaders instituted such a flawed strategy from the outset of the Iraq war that there no longer are any circumstances under which U.S. troops can pull out without seeing the situation deteriorate more, a retired Army general said Monday.

<p>Retired Lt. Gen. Robert G. Gard Jr. said the military turned Iraqis irreversibly against the U.S. because of policies that tolerated civilian casualties.

<p>"The military adhered to its traditional doctrine of destroying the enemy with force, not defeating or neutralizing the enemy," he told a group of about 100 people at a downtown church. "As the number of civilian deaths increased, we turned them against us."

<p>The appearance was sponsored by an anti-war group, Win Without War, which describes itself as a coalition of groups that view international cooperation and enforcement of international law as the best way to provide security for the United States and the world.

<p>President Bush said while campaigning for Republicans in recent days that his administration has a plan for victory in Iraq, and Democrats should not be trusted to control Congress because they have no idea how to win there.

<p>But Gard said the military should have adopted lessons from its experience in Vietnam, but officials preferred to believe the United States would never again have to fight insurgencies.

<p>"We needed to secure areas (in Iraq), establish governments, jurisprudence, begin reconstruction, so the populace sees there's more to gain by joining you rather than joining the insurgents," he said.

<p>Gard, 78, said he believes U.S. troops are "very much opposed" to continued occupation in Iraq but can't speak out about it because they're on active duty.

<p>Gard, a senior military fellow at the Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation in Washington, D.C., served in Korea and Vietnam. He retired from the Army in 1981.

<p>He was one of 22 former military officials and retired diplomats who signed a letter to President Bush in August urging him to open immediate discussions with Iran to help resolve differences over its nuclear program.
