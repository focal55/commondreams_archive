        <p> Two grandmothers from Yorkshire face up to a year in prison after becoming the first people to be arrested under the Government's latest anti-terror legislation. </p>

        
          
          
            <p>
  Helen John, 68, and Sylvia Boyes, 62, both veterans of the Greenham Common 
  protests 25 years ago, were arrested on Saturday after deliberately setting 
  out to highlight a change in the law which civil liberties groups say will 
  criminalise free speech and further undermine the right to peaceful 
  demonstration.
</p>
<p>
  Under the little-noticed legislation, which came into effect last week, 
  protesters who breach any one of 10 military bases across Britain will be 
  treated as potential terrorists and face up to a year in jail or &pound;5,000 
  fine. The protests are curtailed under the Home Secretary's Serious 
  Organised Crime and Police Act.
</p>
<p>
  Campaigners expressed their outrage yesterday at Charles Clarke's new law, 
  which they say is yet another draconian attempt to crack down on legitimate 
  protest under the guise of the war on terror. In October last year a 
  protester in Whitehall was convicted for merely reading out the names of 
  British soldiers killed in Iraq. And at the Labour Party conference in 
  September the Government suffered severe embarrassment when Walter Wolfgang, 
  a veteran peace activist who survived the Nazis, was detained for heckling 
  Jack Straw.

</p>
<p>
  Mrs John and Mrs Boyes, who have 10 grandchildren between them, were held by 
  Ministry of Defence police after walking 15ft across the sentry line at the 
  United States military base at Menwith Hill in North Yorkshire. They were 
  held for 12 hours before being released on police bail. They will learn 
  whether they are to face prosecution when they return to Harrogate police 
  station on 15 April.
</p>
<p>
  "We thought this was a really important issue and we just had to 
  challenge it," said Mrs John, who was nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize 
  last year. Mrs Boyes, who was cleared by a jury at Manchester Crown Court in 
  1999 of causing criminal damage to a British nuclear submarine, said: "
  I am quite willing to break the law and prepared to be charged and to go to 
  prison. The Government thinks it can do whatever it wants and that it has a 
  passive public which accepts whatever it throws at it. I find it very 
  worrying."
</p>
<p>
  The women, who have been arrested more than a dozen times between them, went 
  equipped with a hammer and a small pair of bolt cutters as well as placards 
  declaring their opposition to the new law. They had prepared statements 
  denouncing United States military policy and expressing their support for 
  the people of Diego Garcia and the Chagos Islands, who were evicted from 
  their homes to make way for US military bases.
</p>
<p>
  As well as Menwith Hill, the sites covered under the new law include 
  Fylingdales, the early warning station on the North York Moors and the US 
  air bases at Mildenhall and Lakenheath in East Anglia. From next week the 
  powers will also cover three nuclear sites - Aldermaston in Berkshire, its 
  research facility at neighbouring Burghfield and the Devonport naval base at 
  Plymouth. The Government's decision suggests it is already preparing for the 
  protests that would follow the expected decision to replace Trident with a 
  new generation of nuclear weaponry.
</p>

<p>
  Similar restrictions will be announced soon on selected non-military sites 
  such as royal palaces and government buildings. The Ministry of Defence said 
  the sites had been chosen because they had been the scene of regular 
  protests. A spokeswoman said: "Persistent activity by protesters places 
  them at risk of being mistaken for terrorists. It also unnecessarily diverts 
  police resources ... People will still be allowed to protest outside sites. 
  This legislation is about keeping police focused on the job they are paid to 
  do."
</p>
<p>
  Kate Hudson, who chairs the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, said: "
  The Government has a responsibility to safeguard its citizens - we would be 
  the first to argue that. But there is a very fine line between protecting 
  people and introducing legislation that is an infringement of civil 
  liberties. In recent legislation the Government has got on the wrong side of 
  that fine line."
</p>
<p>
  Shami Chakrabarti, the director of Liberty, said: "When does a peaceful 
  protester become a trespasser? In a free society, when does he become a 
  criminal? In Britain in 2006, only one man - the Home Secretary - will now 
  decide instead of Parliament and the court. Just when our politicians lament 
  the demise of participatory democracy they increasingly criminalise both 
  free speech and protest."
</p>
<p>
  Mrs John described the new law as a "kick in the teeth for the Magna 
  Carta" and said the need for opponents of the Government to take direct 
  action was greater now than ever. "We have seen two million people 
  standing in Hyde Park and Tony Blair had no compunction in ignoring them. 
  Even though there are huge numbers of people who oppose what the Government 
  is doing, the only effective protests have been where direct action is 
  taken. We have to demonstrate at the bases where the killing capacity exists 
  - we have to attack it at source. These are the eyes and ears of the US war 
  fighting machine and they are on our soil."
</p>
<p>

  Before Mr Clarke's announcement military police only had the power to escort 
  protesters off the military sites and prosecute them for civil trespass.

  <b>Gagging orders</b>
<p>
  <b>John Catt</b>
</p>
<p>
  AGE: 81

</p>
<p>
  CRIME?: Wearing an anti-Blair T-shirt in Brighton during the Labour 
  conference.
</p>
<p>
  WHAT HAPPENED: He was stopped under section 44 of the 2000 Terrorism Act as 
  he walked towards the seafront for an anti-war demonstration outside the 
  conference. His T-shirt accused Mr Blair and George Bush of war crimes. He 
  was released after signing a form confirming he had been questioned. The 
  police record said the purpose of the stop and search was "terrorism"
 and the official grounds for intervention were "carrying plackard + 
  T-shirt with anti-Blair info" (sic).
</p>
<p>
  <b>Walter Wolfgang</b>
</p>
<p>
  AGE: 82

</p>
<p>
  CRIME?: Heckling Jack Straw, the Foreign Secretary, during his speech to the 
  Labour Party conference.
</p>
<p>
  WHAT HAPPENED: The veteran peace activist shouted "That's a lie" 
  as Mr Straw justified keeping British troops in Iraq. He was manhandled by 
  stewards out of his seat and ejected from the Brighton Centre. When he tried 
  to re-enter he was briefly detained under Section 44 of the 2000 Terrorism 
  Act. Amid the disastrous publicity, senior ministers, from Tony Blair down, 
  apologised.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Maya Evans</b>
</p>
<p>
  AGE: 25

</p>
<p>
  CRIME?: Protesting over British casualties in Iraq.
</p>
<p>
  WHAT HAPPENED: Standing on the Cenotaph in Whitehall, she read out a list of 
  soldiers killed in Iraq. She was arrested under the Serious Organised Crime 
  and Police Act 2005, which requires police permission to make a protest 
  within one kilometre of Parliament. She was given a conditional discharge 
  after being found guilty. Lord Falconer of Thoroton, the Lord Chancellor, 
  later denied that the prosecution was an "undue infringement" of 
  individual liberties.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Flt Lt Malcolm Kendall-Smith</b>
</p>
<p>
  AGE: 37

</p>
<p>
  CRIME?: Refusing to serve in Iraq.
</p>
<p>
  WHAT HAPPENED: The RAF doctor served in Iraq twice, but refused to return 
  for a third spell of duty last June. He argued that the military action was 
  not justified as Iraq had not attacked the UK or one of its allies. He is 
  being court-martialled, facing five charges of refusing to comply with an 
  order. After a pre-trial hearing rejected his argument that the orders were 
  unlawful, the court martial will open at Aldershot next week.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Brian Haw</b>
</p>
<p>
  AGE: 56

</p>
<p>
  CRIME?: Maintaining an anti-war vigil outside Parliament.
</p>
<p>
  WHAT HAPPENED: Mr Haw has become a permanent fixture in Parliament Square 
  since June 2001, when he erected a series of placards berating Tony Blair 
  and President George Bush. The Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005, 
  was designed mainly with his vigil in mind. But the High Court ruled that 
  the legislation did not cover his protest as it could not be applied 
  retrospectively. The Government is appealing against that decision.
