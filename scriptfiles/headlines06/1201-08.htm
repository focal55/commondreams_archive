&quot;It is time to ask some hard questions. Why did we go into
Iraq and what did the president know and when did he know it,&quot;
Sanders said in an interview in his Burlington office on a
hillside above Lake Champlain near Canada's border.</p><p>&quot;The war in Iraq has been an absolute disaster and it's
absolutely imperative that America never again goes that route.
That's why we have to ask those questions,&quot; he said.</p><p>Sanders has voted with Democrats in the House since his
first election in 1990 and plans to continue to do so in the
Senate, where his vote is needed for Democrats to keep its slim
51-49 majority. Democrats ran no candidate against him in this
year's election.</p><p>His views described as democratic socialist underscore
tension in the new Democratic-controlled Congress between urges
to confront and investigate President George W. Bush's
administration and to govern from the middle while refraining
from the most controversial elements on the liberal agenda.</p><p>But Sanders, who eschews the polished, made-for-television
style of dress and appearance often favored by Washington's
elite for the rumpled look of a distracted professor, said he
sees his role as an agitator for dramatic reforms and
investigations.</p><p>&quot;We also need to answer questions about Halliburton, no bid
contracts, Katrina,&quot; he said. &quot;We need to ask questions about
the connection between the pharmaceutical industry and the
writing of the prescription drug Medicare bill.&quot;</p><p>&quot;The American people are entitled to answers about the
behavior of the most reactionary and incompetent administration
in modern American history,&quot; he said.</p><p>That firebrand and iconoclast position has made Sanders, a
Brooklyn native, immensely popular in Vermont, where a
counter-culture streak runs as thick as its forests and where
several towns this year passed resolutions to impeach Bush.</p><p>DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST</p><p>In 1981, when Sanders narrowly won election as mayor of
Burlington, the victory was seen by some business leaders as a

&quot;socialist&quot; takeover of the state's largest city.</p><p>But after reviving the city's waterfront, creating a
downtown pedestrian mall and encouraging investment including a
minor league baseball franchise, his popularity grew.</p><p>Fears he would have the government take over utilities
faded and in 1988 Burlington was rated America's &quot;most livable
city&quot; by the U.S. Conference of Mayors in the under-100,000
population category.</p><p>&quot;I'm not against people becoming wealthy but there is a
limit,&quot; he said from his office in a refurbished 19th century
Masonic temple. &quot;The only people doing well in this economy are
very wealthy and that is an issue that has to be addressed.&quot;</p><p>Sanders, who at 65 is the oldest member of the Senate's
freshman class of 2006, said he would target the lack of health
insurance for 48 million Americans, loss of manufacturing jobs,
trade policies that send jobs overseas, tax breaks for the
wealthy and corporate control of the American media.</p><p>The United States, he says, should take lessons from the
&quot;Democratic socialist&quot; models of Northern Europe, countries
like Sweden, Finland, Denmark, which he says encourage
capitalism while also offering protections for middle class
families.</p>
