        Tony Blair remained defiant last night in the face of a torrent of protests over Britain's human rights record, accusing his critics of having "the world the wrong way round".
<p>
  The Prime Minister was under pressure over his support for US "rendition flights", his failure to call openly for the closure of the 
  Guantanamo Bay camp in Cuba, and over draconian anti-terror laws, after 
  damning reports by the Labour-led Commons Foreign Affairs Committee and by 
  Amnesty International. His comments on the state of Iraq came on another day 
  of bloodshed in the country.
</p>
<p>
  He even appeared out of step with his own Attorney General, Lord Goldsmith, 
  who warned his cabinet colleagues that terrorist suspects were entitled to 
  the same legal protections as "law-abiding citizens".
</p>
<p>
  Speaking at the London School of Economics, Lord Goldsmith said: "
  Determining if a particular person is, or is not, a terrorist requires more 
  than mere assertion on the part of an authority, however genuine and 
  well-intentioned that authority may be."

</p>
<p>
  In a combative performance, Mr Blair used his monthly press conference at 
  Downing Street to reject criticism of the Government's attempts to return 
  terror suspects to countries such as Algeria and Egypt which have a record 
  of torturing prisoners. "We hear an immense amount about their human 
  rights and their civil liberties. But there are also human rights of the 
  rest of us to live in safety," he said.
</p>
<p>
  Amnesty International called for more guarantees of the safety of suspects 
  before they were deported, and monitoring afterwards. But Mr Blair said: "
I think we have got the world the wrong way round. You cannot have a situation 
  where we are expected to keep people in this country without any limit at 
  all, irrespective of the disharmony, disunity and, in some cases, acts of 
  violence that they are inciting."
</p>
<p>
  He added: "I totally understand the issues raised in respect of 
  Guantanamo but the reports of the Foreign Affairs Committee and Amnesty 
  International are far broader and were talking about deportation cases here. 
  I think we have the whole thing upside down. I do not see why we should not 
  be able to deport people from this country, who are not nationals, who have 
  come to this country just to cause trouble."
</p>
<p>
  In a scathing report, Amnesty International protested that anti-terrorism 
  legislation had led to a serious erosion of human rights in Britain since 
  2001. Irene Khan, Amnesty International's secretary general, said: "
  There is now a dangerous imbalance between draconian actions the UK is 
  taking in the name of security and its obligation to protect human rights. 
  These measures tarnish the UK's image and its ability to promote human 
  rights abroad."
</p>

<p>
  However, the Prime Minister was unrepentant about his support for President 
  Bush in the war on terrorism. The Foreign Affairs Committee, chaired by the 
  Labour MP Mike Gapes, said the detention of 500 people in Guantanamo 
  diminished the United States' moral authority and was a hindrance to the 
  pursuit of the war on terrorism.
</p>
<p>
  Asked why he had so far failed publicly to condemn Guantanamo, like his MPs 
  and one of his ministers, Peter Hain, Mr Blair said: "I have said why I 
  think Guantanamo is an anomaly. I also think it is important we never forget 
  the context in which this has happened: the war in Afghanistan and the 
  reason for that; the slaughter of 3,000 innocent people on September 11."</p>
<p>
  Amnesty International also criticised alleged UK involvement in "rendition flights" by the US of terrorist suspects for questioning 
  under torture. Mr Blair denied there was any evidence Britain had 
  co-operated.
</p>
<p>
  Mr Blair defended the war in Iraq, describing it as a battle between 
  democracy and terrorism and extremism. But the situation on the ground 
  continues to deteriorate: more than 130 people have died in violence since 
  the Golden Mosque in Samarra was blown up on Wednesday.
</p>
<p>

  He had time for a sideswipe at the Prince of Wales for suggesting in his 
  diaries that the Government relied too heavily on focus groups. Asked about 
  the Prince's criticism, he replied: "I don't know I can answer that 
  question - until we have had a focus group."
</p>

  <b>Causes for concern: </b>
<p>
  <i>The verdict of the Foreign Affairs Committee on the Government's human 
  rights record</i>
</p>
<p> <b>Guantanamo Bay
</b></p>
<p>
  The continued existence of the American detention centre, which is holding 
  at least six British residents, diminishes the moral authority of the US and 
  hinders the war on terrorism. Ministers should drop their behind-the-scenes 
  lobbying to "make loud and public [their] objection" to the camp.
</p>
<p>
<b>Extraordinary Rendition</b></p>
<p>
  There are "serious concerns" over allegations the CIA used British 
  airports and airspace to transport prisoners for interrogation, and possible 
  torture, in other countries. Ministers have a duty to investigate the claims 
  and to "make clear to the USA that any extraordinary renditions to 
  states where suspects may be tortured is completely unacceptable".
</p>
<p>
<b>Deportations</b></p>
<p>
  Attempts to sign "memoranda of understanding" - guarantees that 
  anyone deported there will not be harmed - with states such as Algeria are 
  legally "questionable". They must not be used as a "fig leaf 
  to disguise the real risk of torture". There are "strong concerns"
 that monitoring to check that deportees are not mistreated after their return 
  may not be adequate.
</p>
<p>
<b>Iraq</b></p>
<p>
  Concerns about abuses of Iraqi prisoners by coalition troops have been 
  renewed by the recent videotape showing British soldiers beating captives. "
The United Kingdom has a responsibility to engage its ally both privately and 
  publicly on the question of abuses by US troops. We recommend that the 
  Government make clear and public its condemnation of human rights abuses 
  committed by any of the multinational forces in Iraq."
