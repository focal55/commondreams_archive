<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p>WASHINGTON - President George W. Bush 
took a swipe at Big Bird and his ilk Monday as he proposed 
slashing funds to public broadcasting by more than $150 
million.

        <!--/endimage/--> In the president's 2007 budget request, funding for the 
Corporation for Public Broadcasting will be cut by $53.5 
million in 2007 and $50 million more in 2008. Those cuts don't 
reflect others made in funding at the Education and Commerce 
departments and the elimination of specific programs for 
digital TV conversion and satellite delivery system. Public 
broadcasting officials estimate that the entire budget cuts run 
$157 million over the two-year period.

<p>"Oscar the Grouch has been friendlier to the Sesame Street 
characters than President Bush, who has chosen to make huge 
cuts to children's television programming," said Rep. Ed 
Markey, D-Mass. "In a world of fast-and-furious television with 
ratings-driven content, the public broadcasting system 
represents the last stronghold of quality child-oriented 
programming -- we owe this to America's children."

<p>The cuts in public broadcasting are part of an attempt by 
the White House to reduce the country's red ink as the 
administration seeks more money for the military and seeks to 
make Bush's first-term tax cuts permanent.

<p>Attempts by conservative Republicans to cut CPB funds are 
nothing new. Many conservatives view the public broadcasting as 
a bastion of liberalism. While there have been attempts to make 
cuts, the service has wide support in Congress from Republicans 
and Democrats who like its dedication to public affairs and 
educational programming.

<p>Last year, an overwhelming majority in Congress voted to 
restore cuts proposed by the administration. This year, those 
cuts go even deeper, and it could be more difficult to win the 
fight in Congress, said John Lawson, president and CEO of the 
Association of Public Television Stations.

<p>"We've dealt with cuts from this White House every year, 
but these are the deepest he's ever presented," Lawson said. 
"We see a clear and present danger here."

<p>It took an advertising campaign from public TV stations to 
mobilize the service's supporters, something that might not be 
as effective a second time, he said.

<p>"This is a tough environment in Washington right now, and 
we're competing with other priorities," Lawson said. "If you 
don't make your case, you lose," he said. "We won last year, 
but only after we asked the stations to go on the air and tell 
their communities what was happening. It's an effort we won't 
foreclose, but if you do that every year, it loses its 
effectiveness. We're going to try to win this one on the 
ground."

<p>In his $2.77 billion budget, Bush asks Congress to sharply 
cut or eliminate 141 government programs. Almost one-third of 
the targeted programs are in education, including ones that 
provide money to support the arts, vocational education, parent 
resource centers and drug-free schools.

<p>"My administration has focused the nation's resources on 
our highest priority -- protecting our citizens and our 
homeland," Bush said in his budget message.

<p>Bush's spending proposals are for the 2007 budget year that 
begins October 1. The $2.77 trillion in spending would be up 
2.3% from projected spending of $2.71 trillion this year.

<p>The administration in its budget documents said the deficit 
for this year will soar to an all-time high of $423 billion, 
reflecting increased outlays for the Iraq war and hurricane 
relief.
