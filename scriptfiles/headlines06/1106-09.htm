<p>


It said that a 16-strong team from the OSCE's election observation body, the Office of Democratic Institutions for Human Rights, would be carrying out the exercise at the invitation of the US government.</p>
<p>

Heading the team, which includes specialists from Britain, the Czech Republic, France, Germany, Hungary, Russia and Ukraine, is Giovanni Kessler, an Italian constitutional lawyer and a member of Italy's parliament, a statement said.</p>
<p>

The monitors have met state electoral authorities, political parties and candidates across the country, and some team members will be present at polling places during Tuesday's vote.</p>
<p>

Analysts have been following campaign activities, the legislative framework and its implementation, the media, the work of the election administration and relevant government bodies, and the resolution of election disputes, the OSCE said.</p>
<p>
In a report published in July intended to justify the mission, the group noted: &quot;While elections are conducted according to different legislation in all 50 states and other territories, important differences in polling procedures can also occur between different counties within the same state.&quot;</p>
<p>

The report also listed a series of alleged irregularities and complaints from civil society groups following the last elections. These included voter intimidation and local misinformation campaigns via pamphlets from anonymous sources with incorrect data regarding polling day procedures.</p>
<p>

A final report with findings and recommendations is expected around six weeks after the elections.</p>
<p>

An OSCE mission was in the United States during the 2004 presidential election and the 2002 mid-term elections.</p>

<p>

The 56-member OSCE, originally set up as a point of contact between NATO and Warsaw Pact countries, has evolved since the end of the Cold War into an organisation mainly concerned with safeguarding human rights, democracy and the rule of law in Europe.</p>
