<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->Greenwich businessman <a href="http://www.nedlamont.com/" target="_new">Ned Lamont</a> moved closer Monday toward a challenge of U.S. Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman as he created a candidate committee, named a campaign manager and began searching for a headquarters.<BR>
<BR>"It is a significant step forward," said Tom Swan, who is managing what he says is still an exploratory campaign. "I am happy that Ned asked me to play a role within this campaign."<BR><BR>Lamont, 52, the president and founder of a cable television company, Lamont Digital Systems, stepped forward last month as the possible champion for Democrats disaffected with Lieberman's support for President Bush and the war in Iraq.<BR><BR>In the past weeks, Lamont has created a website and embarked on an informal speaking tour to gauge support for a challenge of Lieberman, a three-term senator who was the Democratic nominee for vice president in 2000.<BR><BR>Swan, a liberal activist and longtime critic of Lieberman, took a leave of absence Monday from his job as executive director of the Connecticut Citizen Action Group so that he can work full time for Lamont.<BR><BR>The citizen group's political director, John Murphy, also will be joining the Lamont campaign.<BR><BR>Lamont has said that he will not move beyond an exploratory campaign until at least 1,000 volunteers sign up on his campaign website, <a href="http://www.nedlamont.com/" target="_new">nedlamont.com</a>.<BR>
<BR>"For him to officially get in, we're going to need to recruit volunteers from every town," Swan said.<BR><BR>Lieberman declined through a spokesman to comment Monday on Lamont's moves or the prospect of facing a Democratic primary in August. He has not had a serious contest since he took the seat from Sen. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. in 1988.<BR><BR>Weicker, an opponent of the war, is considering running as an independent to oppose Lieberman on the general-election ballot in November.
