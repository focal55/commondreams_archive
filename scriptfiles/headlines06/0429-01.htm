<p> WASHINGTON  - The FBI secretly sought information last year 
on 3,501 U.S. citizens and legal residents from their banks and 
credit card, telephone and Internet companies without a court's 
approval, the Justice Department said Friday.</p>

        <!--/endimage/--> It was the first time the Bush administration has publicly 
disclosed how often it uses the administrative subpoena known as a 
National Security Letter, which allows the executive branch of 
government to obtain records about people in terrorism and 
espionage investigations without a judge's approval or a grand jury 
subpoena.  </p>
<p>Friday's disclosure was mandated as part of the renewal of the 
Patriot Act, the administration's sweeping anti-terror law.  </p>

<p>The FBI delivered a total of 9,254 NSLs relating to 3,501 people 
in 2005, according to a report submitted late Friday to Democratic 
and Republican leaders in the House and Senate. In some cases, the 
bureau demanded information about one person from several 
companies.  </p>
<p>The numbers from previous years remain classified, officials 
said.  </p>
<p>The department also reported it received a secret court's 
approval for 155 warrants to examine business records last year 
under a Patriot Act provision that includes library records. 
However, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales has said the department 
has never used the provision to ask for library records.  </p>
<p>The number was a significant jump over past use of the warrant 
for business records. A year ago, Gonzales told Congress there had 
been 35 warrants approved between November 2003 and April 2005.  </p>
<p>The spike is expected to be temporary, however, because the 
Patriot Act renewal that President Bush signed in March made it 
easier for authorities to obtain subscriber information on 
telephone numbers captured through certain wiretaps.  </p>


<p>The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, the same panel that 
signs off on applications for business records warrants, also 
approved 2,072 special warrants last year for secret wiretaps and 
searches of suspected terrorists and spies. The record number is 
more than twice as many as were issued in 2000, the last full year 
before the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.  </p>
<p>The FBI security letters have been the subject of legal battles 
in two federal courts because, until the Patriot Act changes, 
recipients were barred from telling anyone about them.  </p>
<p>Ann Beeson, the associate legal counsel for the American Civil 
Liberties Union, said the report to Congress "confirms our fear 
all along that National Security Letters are being used to get the 
records of thousands of innocent Americans without court 
approval."  </p>
<p>The number disclosed Friday excludes requests for subscriber 
information, an exception written into the law. It was unclear how 
many FBI letters were not counted for that reason.             </p>
