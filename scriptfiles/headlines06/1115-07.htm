Frustrated by local TV news outlets that run "commercials disguised as 
news," an FCC commissioner wants to investigate stations that don't tell 
viewers they may be watching corporate propaganda instead of independently 
reported information.
<P>KGO-TV, an ABC affiliate in San Francisco, was one of 46 stations in 22 
states cited for improperly including video news releases, or VNRs, into news 
stories, according to a report released Tuesday by two watchdog groups <a href="http://www.prwatch.org">Center 
for Media and Democracy</a> and <a href="http://www.freepress.org">Free Press</a>. Tuesday's report was a follow-up to an 
April study by the same organizations that found that 77 stations nationally  
--  including CBS 5-TV (KPIX) in San Francisco  --  had improperly used VNRs. 
Representatives of both stations acknowledged erroneously using them and called 
them isolated incidents. 
<P>A VNR is a prepackaged segment that looks and sounds like journalistically 
reported information but is produced by either a public relations firm or a 
government body with a vested interest in the product or service being 
described. 
<P>While media advocates say including prepackaged material may not seem as 
serious when a TV news reporter is doing a fluffy feature piece on what kind of 
lipstick to wear, the implications could be more dire if the journalist 
broadcasts corporately produced information  --  without critical examination 
or identification  --  when reporting on a new treatment for liver cancer. 
<P>Tuesday's six-month investigation included a story aired by a TV station 
in Missouri that questioned global warming and was largely based on a VNR 
created by oil industry lobbyists. The station didn't identify the source of 
the material. 
<P>The Federal Communications Act requires broadcasters to inform their 
audience "that such matter is sponsored, paid for or furnished, either in whole 
or in part; and by whom or on whose behalf such consideration was supplied." 

<P>Failure to identify the source of a VNR is also an ethical violation. The 
industry's Radio-Television News Directors Association guidelines on VNR usage 
says: "news managers and producers should clearly disclose the origin of 
information and label all material provided by corporate or other non-editorial 
sources." 
<P>In April's report, the study found that one-third of the time, "stations 
aired fake news stories in their entirety as their own reporting," according to 
the Center for Media and Democracy. 
<P>"No wonder the public is having a hard time distinguishing between news 
and propaganda," Federal Communications Commissioner Jonathan Adelstein said 
Tuesday in response to the findings. 
<P>He was supported by fellow commissioner Michael Copps. "Americans have a 
legal right to know that what appears to be independent news reports are 
actually bought and paid for by a private corporation," Copps said. 
<P>Adelstein expressed frustration that stations haven't been cowed by the 
FCC investigation into VNR usage begun in August and called for the federal 
agency to investigate the new allegations. The agency sent letters of inquiry 
to the 77 stations mentioned in the April report. Still, 10 of those stations 
under investigation have used VNRs in the past six months, according to 
Tuesday's report. 
<P>Last month, the Radio-Television News Directors Association asked the FCC 
to halt its investigation into VNR usage, saying it had created a "chilling 
effect" for stations. Because many stations had curtailed using the prepackaged 
pieces, "viewers have lost access to video that might explain or illustrate the 
promises of a newly released life-altering drug, or the potentially fatal 
dangers posed by a common food," according to a letter the association filed 
with the agency. 
<P>The industry association also criticized the April watchdog study, saying 
that the number of VNR stories cited without disclosure was "hardly relevant" 
given that more than 1 million local news stories aired over that period. 
<P>Among the incidents cited in Tuesday's report was a consumer news story 
about rental cars that aired on San Francisco's KGO-TV in June. The story 
included material from a VNR produced for Allstate Insurance without 
identification. 
<P>KGO News director Kevin Keeshan said Tuesday that "this was a clear 
violation of our policy on VNR usage" and that the segment producer involved 
was "disciplined." The station has since changed its policy on VNR usage, now 
requiring the approval of at least an executive producer at the station before 
airing properly identified material from a VNR. 
<P>CBS 5-TV was cited in the April report for a January news story it 
broadcast about the first inhalable insulin treatment approved by the U.S. Food 
and Drug Administration. The report found that half of the story was pulled 
from a VNR created for the drug's maker, Pfizer.  
<P>CBS 5-TV vice president and news director Dan Rosenheim said that "this 
was a legitimate news story," but that the station failed to attribute the 
material used to a VNR, which "was a departure from our policy." While 
declining to say if the employees involved were disciplined, he said the matter 
was addressed internally. 
<P>Both TV news industry standards and local news directors say there are 
instances where properly identified VNRs can be ethically used without 
compromising the news-gathering process. If a station is airing a story about a 
new drug and needs footage of the production facility and can't get it on 
deadline, a VNR could be useful, Rosenheim said. 
<P>Neither news director thought inappropriate VNR usage is a widespread 
problem. Given all the national material it receives from ABC News and because 
it is an affiliate of CNN, KGO-TV's Keeshan said, "we have way more material 
than we can possibly put on television every day."
