Police took 10 war protesters into custody Monday at the Golden Gate 
Bridge after a three-hour standoff that backed up New Year's Day traffic and 
frayed tempers of tourists and bicyclists hoping for a jaunt across the span. 
<P>The confrontation began at noon when about a dozen members of the women's 
peace organization CodePink prepared to walk across the bridge as a vigil to 
remember the 3,000 U.S. soldiers killed in Iraq. 
<P>Officers from the California Highway Patrol, the Golden Gate Bridge 
District and the San Francisco Police Department barred their way and also 
refused to let tourists onto the span.

The protesters eventually decided to cross a police line and were taken 
into custody. Bicyclists began crossing the west side of bridge again by 3 
p.m., but foot traffic on the east side of the bridge remained off limits after 
the protesters dispersed. 
<P>Among those detained was CodePink co-founder and prominent San Francisco 
peace activist Medea Benjamin.  
<P>"We didn't do anything illegal, nor did we plan to do anything illegal," 
she said after she was released from custody. Benjamin said she and nine others 
have been charged with trespassing, although Highway Patrol officials wouldn't 
confirm the arrests. 

<P>Before she was taken into custody, Benjamin said that the group planned a 
"solemn march," single-file, across the bridge, with no intention of disrupting 
tourists or traffic. They planned to meet another small group of protesters 
crossing from the Vista Point parking area on the north end of the bridge. 
<P>But police, citing security concerns, closed the sidewalk entrances, and a 
standoff ensued.  
<P>"Vigils are taking place all across the country. This may be the only 
place  --  in Nancy Pelosi's home district  --  where that's not allowed," said 
Benjamin, who has been arrested numerous times for protesting the war, 
including her disruption of a speech by Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki 
before a joint session of Congress in July.

Police at the scene said they were concerned about what the protesters 
might do once they were on the bridge. 
<P>Police closed off a lane of northbound bridge traffic as they prepared to 
arrest the protesters, leading to a major traffic back-up on Doyle Drive back 
to the Marina District and on the 19th Avenue and Lincoln Boulevard approaches 
to the bridge. 
<P>Tourist milled outside the south entrance to the bridge sidewalk, some 
bemused, some outraged that they were forbidden to walk through the gate. 
<P>Terry and Tom Eckstrom of El Cerrito said they make a habit every year to 
walk across the Golden Gate Bridge on New Year's Day. They made it across from 
Vista Point in the morning, but found their way back blocked by police. "We got 
to this side and there's all this commotion," said Terry. "It's a great cause, 
and I believe in it. But it is inconvenient." 
<P>Early in the standoff, KGO television cameraman Randy Davis was cut on the 
nose and his camera damaged in a scuffle with a Bridge District police officer. 

<P>KGO news director Kevin Keeshan called the scuffle an illegal assault 
by a police officer and said the station intended to file a report with the 
Highway Patrol.
