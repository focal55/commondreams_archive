Israeli forces launched their most serious military assault on southern Lebanon in six years yesterday by land, sea and air after Hizbollah militants seized two soldiers in a cross-border raid described as an "act of war" by the Israeli Prime Minister. Seven Israeli soldiers were killed in the raid, and the response. 
<p>
  The capture of the two soldiers and the killing of three in the same 
  guerrilla operation embroiled Israel in a second front two weeks after its 
  forces mounted an incursion into Gaza in response to the abduction of a 
  19-year-old army corporal. The army later reported heavy fighting over the 
  Lebanese border.

More than 150 miles to the south, Gaza suffered one of its worst days since 
  the incursions began with medics reporting at least 24 Palestinians dead. 
  These included seven children from the same family killed when a quarter-ton 
  bomb was dropped on their home in an attempt to assassinate the Hamas 
  militia leader Mohammed Deif. Israel signified its intent to continue to 
  fight on two fronts by destroying the Palestinian foreign ministry in Gaza 
  City in an air strike at 1.30am this morning. 
</p>
<p>
  Four Israeli soldiers were killed when a tank was blown up by Hizbollah 
  guerrillas as it crossed the border into Lebanon. The eighth soldier was 
  killed as soldiers tried to reach the tank.
</p>
<p>
  Ehud Olmert, who is facing his most difficult test since winning the Israeli 
  general election in March, said its operations would be "restrained but 
  very, very painful". Meanwhile, the Israeli army reported sporadic 
  Katyusha fire into northern Israel.
</p>

<p>
  The Israel Defence Forces said its warplanes had hit 30 targets in Lebanon, 
  including roads, bridges and Hizbollah positions in what it said had been 
  strikes designed to restrict the movements of the soldiers' captors. At 
  least two civilians were killed. 
</p>
<p>
  The Israeli army's chief of staff, Lt-Gen Dan Halutz, was reported by 
  Israeli television as warning the Lebanese government that the military 
  would target infrastructure and "turn back the clock in Lebanon by 20 
  years", if the soldiers were not returned.
</p>
<p>
  The Israeli cabinet last night authorised a "severe" response and 
  issued a statement saying it held the Lebanese government responsible for 
  the attacks and the safe return of the abducted soldiers. It said offered no 
  specific details of the action it planned to take. The Arab League called 
  for an emergency meeting of Arab foreign ministers. 
</p>
<p>
  The Israeli army said Hizbollah guerrillas fired a volley of Katyusha 
  rockets before executing their raid on an Israeli military vehicle as it 
  patrolled on the Israeli side of the border, north of Zarit. Seven hours 
  earlier, in the most lethal single incident of the present military campaign 
  in Gaza, an air strike destroyed the two-storey house in the Sheikh Radwan 
  area of Gaza City. It killed a Hamas activist, his wife and his seven 
  children, aged between four and 15.
</p>
<p>

  The Israelis failed to kill the target of the attack, the Hamas militant 
  leader long at the top on Israel's wanted list, Mohammed Deif. But as Hamas 
  militants mounted a guard at the intensive care unit of Gaza City's Shifa 
  hospital last night, unnamed Palestinian security officials reported that he 
  might be paralysed.
</p>
<p>
  Rescue workers pulled a four-year-old child out of the rubble. He had on a 
  red T-shirt but his body was cut in two. Palestinian doctors said the owner 
  of the house, Nabil Abu Salmiyeh, a lecturer at the Islamic University and a 
  Hamas activist, had been killed along with his wife and seven of his nine 
  children. 
</p>
<p>
  Rami Samour, 25, who lives near by, said the blast blew the mutilated body 
  of a woman into a neighbouring house. A neighbour, Safwan Amamour, 39, said 
  he and his wife were hit by flying rubble. He said: "No words can 
  describe this destruction, this hellish damage, which I will remember of the 
  rest of my life." 
</p>
<p>
  In separate attacks in central Gaza, Israeli troops killed at least nine 
  Palestinians, including a policemen and at least two Islamic Jihad militants 
  in a car. Troops had moved into the area in the early morning, in effect 
  cutting north Gaza from the south. 
</p>
<p>
  In another attack, Israeli soldiers killed four gunmen planting explosives 
  in a road used by the army to enter central Gaza. In a third incident, 
  Palestinian security officials said an Israeli aircraft fired a missile into 
  a police station in the central Gaza town of Khan Yunis, killing a policeman 
  and wounding two others. 

</p>
<p>
  The outcome of the Lebanon engagement is seen as critical for Mr Olmert and 
  his Defence Minister, the Labour leader, Amir Peretz. Both lack the military 
  experience of their recent predecessors. Military failure would seriously 
  weaken the government, triggering an increasingly influential role for other 
  figures inside and outside the cabinet with more notable military and 
  intelligence backgrounds. 
</p>
<p>
  The Hizbollah raid was also thought likely to strengthen the hand of those 
  ministers preferring a military escalation over the pursuit of diplomatic 
  efforts to secure the release of Cpl Gilad Shalit, still presumed to be 
  alive in Gaza. Their argument will be that yesterday's raid vindicates Mr 
  Olmert's stated argument that negotiations on prisoner releases will 
  encourage more seizures of Israeli soldiers. 
</p>
<p>
  The Hizbollah leader, Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah, told a reporters in Beirut 
  that no military operation would return the captured soldiers and added: "
The prisoners will not be returned except through one way: indirect 
  negotiations and a trade."
</p>
<p>
  Israel said it would not agree to a prisoner swap. "You don't negotiate 
  with terror organisations," said Gideon Meir, at the Israeli Foreign 
  Ministry.
</p>

<p>
  Geir Pedersen, the senior UN official in Lebanon, met Lebanon's Prime 
  Minister and said Hizbollah had crossed the border into northern Israel. He 
  said: "Hizbollah's action escalates the already tense situation and is 
  an act of very dangerous proportions." 
</p>
<p>
  The Lebanese Information Minister, Ghazi Aridi, said: "The government 
  did not know, and does not bear responsibility nor embrace what happened."</p>
