<p>Several Houston television stations
withheld a political ad on Wednesday accusing U.S. Rep. Tom
DeLay of corruption after a lawyer for the former House
majority leader said the ad was false and could lead to legal
action.
<p><a href="http://www.pcactionfund.org/accountability/index.htm">The ad</a>, sponsored by public interest groups <a href="http://www.ourfuture.org">Campaign for
America's Future</a> and <a href="http://www.pcactionfund.org/">Public Campaign Action Fund</a>, calls for
DeLay to resign because of his indictment in Texas on campaign
finance charges and his links to disgraced Washington lobbyist
Jack Abramoff.</p>
<p>"All four of the major broadcast stations (in Houston)
contacted to air the ad, as well as Time Warner cable, have
stated they either will not run the ad or will keep it off the
air for further review," according to a statement sent out by
DeLay's office.
</p>
<p>Some of the stations said during their newscasts they were
looking at the ad to determine its credibility or that they had
found some of the allegations to be questionable. The ad was
supposed to run for a week, starting on Wednesday.</p>
<p>In a letter to the stations, DeLay attorney Donald McGahn
said the ad was "reckless, malicious and false, casting Mr.
DeLay in a false light by accusing him of unsubstantiated
criminal conduct. Such accusations are actionable."</p>
<p>"We demand that you refuse or otherwise cease airing the
advertisement, so as to avoid any liability," the letter said.</p>
<p>Public Campaign Action Fund national campaigns director
David Donnelly said DeLay was trying to prevent people in his
Houston-area district from knowing what "he's up to with
corrupt lobbyists in Washington."</p>
<p>"When powerful lawmakers corrupt the political process and
get caught, they often try to bully the media to try to prevent
them from doing their job," he said in a statement.</p>
<p>Despite the menacing language in the letter, DeLay
spokeswoman Shannon Flaherty said McGahn was not threatening to
sue the television stations, although at least one of them
reported he was.</p>

<p>Abramoff sent shock waves through Washington last week when
he pleaded guilty to fraud charges and admitted giving lavish
gifts and trips to lawmakers in return for special treatment.
He has agreed to cooperate with prosecutors investigating
corruption in Congress.</p>
<p>DeLay, who received campaign contributions from Abramoff
and associates over the years, has described the lobbyist as a
good friend.</p>
<p>After Abramoff's guilty plea, DeLay announced he was giving
up trying to regain his position as House majority leader,
which is the second most powerful Republican in the House of
Representatives.</p>
<p>He stepped down from the post in September after he was
indicted in Texas on charges of conspiracy and money laundering
linked to campaign contributions raised by his Texans for a
Republican Majority political action committee for the 2002
Texas Legislature elections. DeLay has denied any wrongdoing.
