<p>Americans who think of Slow Food as an elite supper club for snobby food 
purists would be stunned by the scene unfolding inside the former Olympic speed 
skating arena here over the past four days.

Senegalese cereal farmers in purple satin and matching headdresses trade 
packaging tips with Peruvian potato growers in traditional red embroidered 
garb. Goat cheese makers and Hmong long-bean growers from California find 
common ground with their Italian and Eastern European counterparts. Israeli and 
Palestinian farmers, along with Iraqi and American food producers, share space 
and the excited chat that food never fails to stimulate.  
<P>This is Terra Madre, a gathering that is the Olympics of the international 
movement to deindustrialize food production. That means putting taste back at 
the heart of food, saving heirloom fruits, vegetables and animals, keeping 
small farmers in business and in local communities, and pushing farming back on 
sound environmental ground. 
<P>Mingling with the farmers are prominent Bay Area names in the sustainable 
food movement  --  Chez Panisse founder Alice Waters, UC Berkeley journalism 
professor and "The Omnivore's Dilemma'' author Michael Pollan, Full Belly 
Farm's Judith Redmond, Boulevard Restaurant's Nancy Oakes, Incanto's Chris 
Cosentino, Mourad Lahlou of Aziza and the entire A16 restaurant team, just to 
name a few.  

<P>Invited to cook next door at the Salone del Gusto, the giant artisanal food fair that showcases some of Terra Madre producers, were hot Spanish chef Ferran Adria 
of El Bulli and renowned Piedmont chef Cesare Giaccone. 
<P>More than 5,000 small farmers and foodmakers from 130 countries, plus 
1,000 chefs  --  including more than a dozen from the Bay Area  --  are in 
Turin to eat, network and build what Waters called "a global counterculture" in 
her address to the opening session. 
<P>It's the second such gathering organized by Slow Food International, which 
is based in the nearby town of Bra. The first Terra Madre, in 2004, generated 
an astounding force field around the ideas of Slow Food, which started 20 years 
ago as a way of saving inexpensive Italian restaurants serving tagliarini with 
butter and sage and other traditional foods from the wave of nouvelle cuisine 
that put salmon with dill on plates around the world. 
<P>Now, Slow Food has grown into an international movement, with 80,000 
members in 50 countries, including 12,000 in the United States. 
<P>About 500 Americans were invited as delegates and observers, more than a 
quarter of them Californians, including a contingent of organic farmers from 
the Capay Valley in Yolo County who are familiar faces at San Francisco's Ferry 
Plaza and Berkeley farmers' markets. 
<P>Health problems like obesity and diabetes, widening economic disparities 
across the world and environmental issues like global warming show that the 
current system "defined by speed, abundance and waste" can no longer sustain 
itself, Slow Food founder Carlo Petrini told the conference, which concludes 
today. 
<P>The time is ripe, he said, to bring food economies back to their local 
roots. 
<P>For a group of Hmong, Latino and African American farmers from the Central 
Valley of California brought to Terra Madre with help from the Davis-based 
Community Alliance With Family Farmers, that meant connecting with farmers from 
around the world. 
<P>Ali Shabazz, an African American herb farmer from Fresno, helped a 
Tanzanian farmer who wanted technical advice on equipment. Va Moua, who says 
many of the Hmong farmers in the Central Valley use lots of fertilizer, talked 
to farmers who don't. 
<P>"Now we'll find out if we can do it naturally," he said. 
<P>The point, said Blong Lee, a representative of the Fresno County Economic 
Opportunities Commission, is to get Central Valley farmers thinking about ways 
they can distinguish themselves and their crops, and to get their products into 
the local economy instead of the global one. 
<P>At one point, the California farmers found themselves dubiously eyeing a 
plate of cured meat called capocolla from the southern Italian town of Martina 
Franca. 
<P>Its maker, Costantini Angelo, had ideas for the California farmers, most 
of whom grow just one crop, sell into the wholesale market, but fail to make 
enough to gain a real foothold in the Central Valley economy. Angelo feeds his 
pigs only acorns from his home region, so his meat has the unique taste of its 
soil. That's a value-added intangible that helps him sell directly to stores 
and obtain the price he wants. 
<P>Moua and Cindy Mai Xiong, farmers who grow jujube  --  a kind of fruit  -- 
on 4 acres near Fresno, touched the acorns and heard the advice  --  but they 
were distracted by their growling stomachs. This was their third day in Italy 
and amid all this beautiful Parmigiana Reggiano and prosciutto di Parma, they 
were starving. 
<P>"We went to a fancy restaurant last night," said Lee of the Fresno 
commission. "We tried to order pizza with pepperoni and they didn't have it, 
and lasagna and spaghetti and meatballs, but they didn't have it. It's not the 
type of Italian food we expected."  
<P>The chefs, meanwhile, reveled in the Italian Italian food. Incanto chef 
Cosentino ate his way through all the lardo  --  a cured meat made from pig fat 
--  and prosciutto he could find and sought esoteric ingredients like tuna 
heart. 
<P>Jackie Martine, chef-owner of the Seaweed Cafe in Bodega Bay, who tries to 
source all of her ingredients locally, made a connection with an African grower 
of vanilla beans  --  something she knows she can never find in Northern 
California  --  from whom she may buy directly. And from a Mauritanian's 
bottarga di mugine, a salted mullet roe, she was inspired to create a similar 
product using her native halibut roe "which is usually thrown away." 

<P>On a trip through a local farmers' market, though, she was stunned to see 
that most of the apples were Granny Smith, red delicious and golden delicious, 
the same ones that dominate American supermarkets. "It's the effect of 
globalization," she said. 
<P>San Franciscan Cosentino, who participated in a panel on meats, said he 
felt a divide between affluent chefs like himself and struggling farmers from 
poorer regions  --  a divide that Slow Food has yet to bridge.  
<P>"I complain because we can't get lungs," he said of federal laws that ban 
what for some is a delicacy. In contrast, a Kenyan livestock farmer on the same 
panel described how water shortages and power failures decimate his cattle 
before he can get them to slaughter, threatening his entire livelihood. 
<P>"There's this disconnect," Cosentino said of the enormous disparity in 
resources among participants in the conference. 
<P>In the United States, Slow Food leaders are well aware that there's a 
similar disconnect between the political ideals forged at Terra Madre and 
consumers' perceptions of Slow Food. 
<P>"The media still regards Slow Food as a dining club; they still don't 
perceive the political content," Pollan told a meeting of the U.S. delegation. 
<P>To try to bridge that gap, to take the ideas of Terra Madre home, Slow 
Food USA is planning an unprecedented gathering of regional artisanal food 
producers in San Francisco in May 2008, Waters said. The idea, dubbed Slow Food 
Nation, could be replicated all over the country, she added. 
<P>"It's clear there is a political movement growing around food,'' Pollan 
said. "And it's about a lot more than food  --  it's about health, the health 
of local economies, the energy crisis.  
<P>"People are ready to hear this movement. It seems the important work now 
is to show that San Francisco is at the center of this movement."
