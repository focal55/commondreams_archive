Like a recurring bad dream for the Bush administration, Venezuelan 
President Hugo Chavez is molding himself into one of the world's most 
pre-eminent anti-American leaders. 
<P>Days before he addressed the United Nations  --  where he called President 
Bush the devil Wednesday  --  Chavez hosted the equally anti-American Iranian 
leader Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in Caracas. They cemented an increasingly close 
alliance by signing more than 20 trade and investment deals, and Chavez 
promised to cut off oil supplies to the United States in the event of a U.S. 
military attack on Iran. 

At last week's summit in Cuba of the 116-nation Non-Aligned Movement, 
Chavez emerged as the heir apparent of the movement's longtime patron, the 
ailing Cuban leader Fidel Castro. However, Chavez has something Castro never 
had  --  huge oil revenues that will last for decades to come. 
<P>"Unlike Castro, who depended on the Soviet Union, Chavez is completely 
independent economically, which gives him a large margin to maneuver," said 
Luis Lander, a professor of social sciences at the Central University of 
Venezuela in Caracas. 
<P>Although Chavez came to power in 1999, his global influence has expanded 
dramatically in the past two years as his oil revenues boomed. He is pouring 
aid into leftist allies Cuba and Bolivia, providing discounted oil to Caribbean 
and Central American nations, buying high-tech weaponry from Russia and even 
spreading Venezuelan wealth around western Africa. If Venezuela succeeds in its 
attempt to gain a two-year rotating seat on the U.N. Security Council, Chavez 
will have a big new megaphone on the global stage.

        <!--/endimage/-->"Chavez is wildly popular in places where you wouldn't imagine people had 
even heard of him," said Carlos Mendoza, who was Venezuela's ambassador to 
Russia until last year and previously was ambassador to Saudi Arabia. "In the 
(Persian) Gulf states, for example, everyone knows who he is, they admire him 
and love him." 
<P>In the past two months, Chavez has been an international whirlwind, 
visiting China, Russia, Belarus, Iran, Indonesia, Vietnam, Malaysia, Portugal, 
Qatar, Syria, Mali, Benin, Angola, Argentina, Brazil and Jamaica. He visited 
Cuba three times, becoming a fixture at Castro's bedside and relaying news of 
the Cuban president's medical condition to the world.  
<P>Chavez's dollar diplomacy has begun to outstrip Washington's. 
<P>U.S. government aid to Latin America was about $1.7 billion this year, of 
which $1 billion was military-related aid for anti-narcotics programs. While 
precise figures are not available, Venezuela's foreign aid appears to be 
several times greater than the U.S. total for the region, according to a 
Chronicle survey of publicly released data. 
<P>Chavez has single-handedly rescued Cuba's economy, providing an estimated 
$1.8 billion annually in oil and other investments. In Argentina, Chavez bought 
$3.1 billion in government bonds in the past year, allowing the government to 
pay off its debts to the International Monetary Fund and World Bank; in 
Bolivia, he is giving about $200 million in aid programs, ranging from military 
supplies to computers for schools; and in Nicaragua and El Salvador, he has 
discounted oil and gasoline to leftist municipal governments controlled by the 
Sandinista Front and Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, respectively.  
<P>In the Caribbean, under a pact known as Petrocaribe, 14 countries pay only 
part of the bill for Venezuelan fuel up front and can finance the rest over 25 
years at low interest. In Jamaica, Chavez has given a $274 million loan for a 
highway and sports complex and $65 million for a refinery. 
<P>In one of his most grandiose plans, Chavez is planning to build a 
5,700-mile natural gas pipeline through South America, at a cost of up to $25 
billion, in an attempt to unite the continent behind his "Bolivarian" vision 
fashioned after the 19th century independence hero Simon Bolivar. 
<P>"These projects make no economic sense, but they are part of his political 
megalomania, so normal economic laws don't apply," said Alberto Quiros, an oil 
industry analyst in Caracas and former president of Royal Dutch Shell's 
Venezuela operations. "Chavez is willing to pay any price." 
<P>So far, in the view of many analysts, Chavez's initiatives are paying off. 
<P>Polls show that Chavez is the third-most popular leader in Latin America. 
According to a report by Consulta Mitofsky, a Mexican polling firm, based on 
surveys taken March through May, Chavez is supported by 70 percent of 
Venezuelans, trailing only his leftist allies Evo Morales of Bolivia and Nestor 
Kirchner of Argentina, at 81 percent and 80 percent, respectively. 
<P>"Many Latin Americans, and people in other continents, are deciding they 
like his nationalism, his opposition to free-market economic policies and 
privatizations, and they are realizing they can stand up to Washington," said 
Steve Ellner, a professor of history at the Universidad de Oriente in the 
eastern city of Puerto La Cruz. 
<P>While Chavez is thought to be a shoo-in for another six-year term in 
December's presidential election, he has not made friends everywhere, even on 
his own continent.  
<P>On Saturday, he said Venezuela would refuse to recognize the Mexican 
government of conservative President-elect Felipe Calderon, saying that leftist 
challenger Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador was robbed of victory in the July 2 
voting. Chavez said the proclamation of Calderon as president destroyed the 
possibility of Mexico having good relations with Caracas. Mexican officials 
reacted angrily, accusing Chavez of interfering in Mexico's domestic politics. 
<P>Relations with left-of-center Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula Da 
Silva chilled after Chavez supported a move earlier this year by Bolivia's Evo 
Morales to expropriate the operations of Brazil's state-owned Petrobras in 
Bolivia's natural gas fields and to demand a tripling in price for Bolivia's 
gas exports to Brazil. Chavez has offered Morales $600 million to help set up a 
Bolivian state-owned gas and oil firm and build a petrochemical complex. 
<P>At home, Chavez's foreign ambitions seem to provoke little enthusiasm. 
Despite giant government billboards in Caracas and elsewhere touting solidarity 
with revolution around the world, attendance at government-organized street 
demonstrations in support of Cuba and the Palestinians, and other leftist 
causes generally draw small crowds.  
<P>According to a public opinion poll conducted in May by Alfredo Keller y 
Asociados, a Venezuelan research firm, 40 percent of Chavez's own supporters 
disagree with his foreign policy. 
<P>But that has not stopped Chavez from moving his foreign policy even 
further leftward. In July, he replaced Foreign Minister Ali Rodriguez, an 
urbane intellectual who had health problems, with hard-liner Nicolas Maduro, a 
former bus driver and trade unionist who was speaker of Congress. Maduro had no 
previous foreign policy experience and speaks only Spanish. 

<P>Chavez established tight personal bonds with several foreign rulers such 
as Iran's Ahmadinejad, came out in support of Hezbollah in its recent 
confrontation with Israel and supports North Korea in its nuclear weapons 
dispute with the United States.  
<P>Chavez's outburst at the U.N. General Assembly on Wednesday is not the 
first time he has aimed venom at Bush.  
<P>In a nationally televised speech March 19, he seemed as if he wanted to 
pick a schoolyard fight with the U.S. president: "You are ignoramus, you are a 
burro, Mr. Danger ... or to say it to you in my bad English," he said, 
switching languages with an exaggerated accent, "you are a donkey, Mr. Danger. 
You are a donkey, Mr. George W. Bush." 
<P>As his audience tittered with nervous laughter, he returned to Spanish. 
"You are a coward, a killer, a genocider, an alcoholic, a drunk, a liar, an 
immoral person, Mr. Danger. You are the worst, Mr. Danger. The worst of this 
planet. ... A psychologically sick man, I know it." 
<P>Chavez constantly accuses the Bush administration of plotting to overthrow 
him. U.S. officials deny any such intent, although they frequently label Chavez 
a destabilizing influence for the hemisphere and express support for 
Venezuela's opposition parties and organizations.  
<P>"I view him as a threat of undermining democracy," Bush said of Chavez in 
a Fox News interview July 31. "And I view him as a threat. You know, I wish he 
would invest his petrodollars with the people of Venezuela, and give them a 
chance to, you know, get out of poverty, and give them a chance to realize 
hopes and dreams."  
<P>In August, the Bush administration created a new position of intelligence 
chief for Venezuela and Cuba  --  a sign that some observers saw as indication 
that Washington has finally decided to treat Chavez as an arch-enemy like 
Castro. 
<P>Chavez nicknamed the office's director, Jack Patrick Maher, a longtime CIA 
official, as "Jack the Ripper," and claimed that "the empire is organizing a 
plan for December or before December," referring to Venezuela's elections. 
<P>A military-civilian coup in 2003 that briefly overthrew Chavez was carried 
out by many groups that at the time were known to receive U.S. funding, and 
documents released in 2004 revealed that U.S. officials had advance knowledge 
of the coup plotting. The Bush administration has denied any involvement in the 
coup attempt, although at the time it expressed support for the junta installed 
by the coup. 
<P>Government documents recently obtained by the Associated Press in response 
to a Freedom of Information Act request show that opposition groups have been 
receiving about $5 million per year in funding through State Department 
channels. But the administration has refused to disclose the names of about 
one-half of the groups receiving the aid, claiming that to do so would endanger 
their security. 
<P>Jeremy Bigwood, an analyst at the Center for Economic Policy Research, a 
liberal Washington think tank, sued the Agency for International Development, 
the State Department's foreign aid arm, last year in federal circuit court in 
Washington, arguing that all such recipients should be identified because the 
aid programs are not part of covert intelligence work. A ruling is expected 
later this year. 
<P>For the time being, however, Chavez seems secure in the saddle. With the 
U.S. military bogged down in Iraq and Afghanistan and the Bush administration 
focusing most of its remaining attention on Iran and North Korea, Washington 
may have little capacity to wage gunboat diplomacy in Latin America. 
<P>"The situation around the world is sufficiently antagonistic to the Bush 
administration that Chavez can gain a lot of support and gradually, bit by bit, 
wear down the United States," said William Ratliff, a Latin America expert at 
the Hoover Institution at Stanford University. "Like Che Guevara said, 'two, 
three, many Vietnams,' Chavez can gain a lot of followers for who knows how 
many years."
