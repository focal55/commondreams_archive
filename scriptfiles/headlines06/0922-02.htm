        The republic of fear is born again. The state of terror now gripping Iraq is 
  as bad as it was under Saddam Hussein. Torture in the country may even be 
  worse than it was during his rule, the United Nation's special investigator 
  on torture said yesterday.

    "The situation as far as torture is concerned now in Iraq is totally 
  out of hand," said Manfred Nowak. "The situation is so bad many 
  people say it is worse than it had been in the times of Saddam Hussein."</p>
<p>
  The report, from an even-handed senior UN official, is in sharp contrast 
  with the hopes of George Bush and Tony Blair, when in 2003 they promised to 
  bring democracy and respect for human rights to the people of Iraq. The 
  brutal tortures committed in the prisons of the regime overthrown in 2003 
  are being emulated and surpassed in the detention centres of the present US- 
  and British-backed Iraqi government. "Detainees' bodies show signs of 
  beating using electric cables, wounds in different parts of their bodies 
  including in the head and genitals, broken bones of legs and hands, electric 
  and cigarette burns," the human rights office of the UN Assistance 
  Mission in Iraq says in a new report.
</p>
<p>

  The horrors of the torture chamber that led to Saddam Hussein's Iraq being 
  labelled "The Republic of Fear", after the book of that title by 
  Kanan Makiya, have again become commonplace. The bodies in Baghdad's morgue "
often bear signs of severe torture including acid-induced injuries and burns 
  caused by chemical substances, missing skin, broken bones (back, hands and 
  legs), missing eyes and wounds caused by power drills or nails", the UN 
  report said. Those not killed by these abuses are shot in the head.
</p>
<p>
  Human rights groups say torture is practised in prisons run by the US as 
  well as those run by theInterior and Defence ministries and the numerous 
  Sunni and Shia militias. 
</p>
<p>
  The pervasive use of torture is only one aspect of the utter breakdown of 
  government across Iraq outside the three Kurdish provinces in the north. In 
  July and August alone, 6,599 civilians were killed, the UN says.
</p>
<p>
  One US Army major was quoted as saying that Baghdad is now a Hobbesian world 
  where everybody is at war with everybody else and the only protection is 
  self-protection. 
</p>
<p>
  Iraq is in a state of primal anarchy. Paradoxically, the final collapse of 
  security this summer is masked from the outside world because the country is 
  too dangerous for journalists to report what is happening. Some 134 
  journalists, mostly Iraqi, have been killed since the fall of Saddam Hussein 
  in 2003. 

</p>
<p>
  The continuing rise in the number of civilians killed violently in Iraq 
  underlines the failure of the new Iraqi government of Prime Minister Nouri 
  al-Maliki installed in May after intense US and British pressure. The new 
  government shows no signs of being more effective than the old. "It is 
  just a government of the Green Zone," said an Iraqi official, referring 
  to the fortified zone in central Baghdad housing the Iraqi government as 
  well as the US and British embassies.
</p>
<p>
  In an attempt to regain control of the capital and reduce sectarian 
  violence, government and US troops launched "Operation Together Forward"
 in mid-July, but it seems to have had only marginal impact for a couple of 
  weeks. The number of civilians killed in July was 3,590 and fell to 3,009 in 
  August but was on the rise again at the end of the month.
</p>
<p>
  The bi-monthly UN report on Iraq is almost the only neutral and objective 
  survey of conditions in the country. The real number of civilians killed in 
  Iraq is probably much higher because, outside Baghdad, deaths are not 
  recorded. The Health Ministry claims, for instance, that in July nobody died 
  violently in al-Anbar province in western Iraq, traditionally the most 
  violent region, but this probably means the violence was so intense that 
  casualty figures could not be collected from the hospitals.
</p>
<p>
  Nobody in Iraq is safe. Buses and cars are stopped at checkpoints and Sunni 
  or Shia are killed after a glance at their identity cards. Many people now 
  carry two sets of identity papers, one Shia and one Sunni. Car number plates 
  showing that it was registered in a Sunni province may be enough to get the 
  driver shot in a Shia neighbourhood. Sectarian civil war is pervasive in 
  Baghdad and central Iraq. Religious processions are frequently attacked. On 
  19 and 20 August, a Shia religious pilgrimage came under sustained attack 
  that left 20 dead and 300 wounded.
</p>

<p>
  The Iraqi state and much of society have been criminalised. Gangs of gunmen 
  are often described on state television as "wearing police uniforms"
. One senior Iraqi minister laughed as he told <i>The Independent</i>: "
  Of course they wear police uniforms. They are real policemen." 
</p>
<p>
  On 31 July, for instance, armed men in police uniforms driving 15 police 
  vehicles kidnapped 26 people in an area of Baghdad known as Arasat that used 
  to be home to several of the capital's better restaurants. Gunmen dressed in 
  police uniforms had also kidnapped the head of Iraq's Olympic Committee, 
  Ammar Jabbar al-Saadi, and 12 others, in the centre of Baghdad. Ransom 
  demands were made. The US military suspected that Baghdad police's serious 
  crime squad may have been responsible and stormed its headquarters to search 
  vainly for the kidnap victims in its basement. 
</p>
<p>
  It has long been a matter of amusement and disgust in Iraq that government 
  ministers travel abroad to give press conferences claiming that the 
  insurgency is on its last legs. One former minister said: "I know of 
  ministers who have never been to their ministries but get their officials to 
  bring documents to the Green Zone where they sign them." 
</p>
<p>
  Beyond the Green Zone, Iraq has descended into murderous anarchy. For 
  several days this month, the main road between Baghdad and Basra was closed 
  because two families were fighting over ownership of an oilfield.

</p>
<p>
  Government ministries are either Shia or Sunni. In Baghdad this month, a 
  television crew filming the morgue had to cower behind a wall because the 
  Shia guards were fighting a gun battle with the Sunni guards of the 
  Electricity Ministry near by.
</p>
<p>
   <b>Then... and now</b>
</p>
<p>
   <b>1998</b> "The Commission on Human Rights noted...massive and 
  extremely grave violations of human rights and of international humanitarian 
  law by the Government of Iraq... hundreds of executions, some of which may 
  have been extrajudicial executions... Torture and ill-treatment continued to 
  be widespread."
</p>
<p>

   <b>2006</b> "The situation as far as torture is concerned is now 
  completely out of hand... many people say that it is worse than in the times 
  of Saddam Hussein. You find bodies with very heavy and serious torture 
  marks. "
</p>
<p>
   <b>1998</b> In July a group of six people, including one woman, were 
  sentenced to death by hanging on charges of organised prostitution, 
  involvement in the white slave trade and smuggling alcohol to Saudi Arabia.
</p>
<p>
   <b>2006</b> On 7 September, the Iraqi authorities announced the execution 
  by hanging at Abu Ghraib prison of 27 prisoners, including one woman, 
  convicted of terror and criminal charges. It is the first mass execution 
  since Saddam Hussein's rule.
