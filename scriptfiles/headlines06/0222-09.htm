An insurgent attack on one of Iraq's
holiest Shi'ite Muslim shrines on Wednesday is almost certain
to deepen divisions in a country ravaged by sectarian bloodshed
and could nudge it closer to civil war, analysts said.

    The Golden Mosque in Samarra is one of four major shrines
in Iraq which are deeply revered by Shi'ite Muslims worldwide.</p>
<p>Iraqi officials across the sectarian and ethnic divides
have clamored to condemn the attack by gunmen who set off
charges inside the mosque, where two of Shi'ite Islam's 12
venerated Imams are believed to buried.</p>
<p>But analysts say it is sure to fuel tensions between Sunni
and Shi'ite Iraqis bubbling since the U.S. invasion of 2003.</p>
<p>"For the Shi'ites, the Imams are deeply revered and
considered holy. From their point of view, this is a major
assault comparable to an attack on Mecca for all Muslims," said
Hazim al-Naimi, a political science professor at Baghdad's
Mustansiriya University.</p>
<p>"We will definitely see more sectarianism after this
attack. This will cause more problems and it could push the
country closer to civil war."</p>
<p>Shi'ite cleric Moqtada al-Sadr blamed Sunni Arab militants
for the bombing and vowed revenge. Witnesses said scores of his
militiamen armed with AK-47 rifles and rocket-propelled
grenades took over streets in his Baghdad stronghold of Sadr
City.</p>
<p>No one appeared to be hurt in the Samarra attack, but it
has already provoked more visible outrage from Iraqi Shi'ites
than bombings that have killed scores of their people in the
past.</p>
<p>In the deadliest attack in 2004, at least 171 people were
killed in twin attacks in Baghdad and Kerbala while they marked
the Shi'ite holiday of Ashura. Sectarian tensions have mounted
since then, with huge suicide bombings in Shi'ite areas and
Sunni accusations of reprisal attacks.</p>

<p><b>SYMBOLISM</b></p>
<p>"The shrine in Samarra has huge symbolic importance for
Shi'ites in Iraq and everywhere," said Joost Hilterman, analyst
for the Washington-based International Crisis Group, who has
recently completed a report on sectarian splits in Iraq.</p>
<p>"The attack we saw this morning will affect the Shi'ites
more than one on the people or on any mosque. This attack will
inflame sectarian passions as hugely as an attack on Najaf or
Kerbala," he said, referring to the two holiest Shi'ite cities.</p>
<p>Wednesday's attack in Samarra was not the first time
Shi'ite places of worship have been damaged since the war that
toppled Saddam Hussein, a Sunni who oppressed the Shi'ite
majority.</p>
<p>The shrine of Imam Ali, founder of Shi'ite Islam, in Najaf
was damaged in 2004 fighting between U.S. troops and a Shi'ite
militia.</p>
<p>But analysts said Wednesday's attack would harden
suspicions among Shi'ites, who now dominate the government and
Interior Ministry, that Sunni politicians involved in talks on
joining a coalition government, were turning a blind eye to
insurgents.</p>
<p>"What we have seen is an emergent tit-for-tat dynamic that
some say is civil war and others say could turn into one,"
Hilterman said. "It really depends where you draw the line."
