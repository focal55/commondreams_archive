<p>WASHINGTON  — To many Republicans, the liberal activist organization <a href="http://www.MoveOn.org" target="_new">MoveOn.org</a> is a political boogeyman that they hope to chase off with new restrictions on so-called 527 groups.</p>
<p>But the pursuit may turn out to be fruitless. Like other major groups planning to inject themselves aggressively into the midterm elections through advertisements, voter drives and issue fights, MoveOn.org has already figured out what it thinks is a better, and less controversial, way to spend its millions. Its 527 — named for a section of the tax code — is being put on ice. </p>

<p>"Our 527  is dormant," said Eli Pariser, executive director of MoveOn.org. He said his group would  predominantly operate as a conventional political action committee, allowing it to more freely mix explicit political support and issue advocacy in a way that Mr. Pariser described as "squeaky clean."</p>
<p>MoveOn.org might be moving on from its 527, but Congress is not. Two years after 527's burst onto the political scene, gaining notoriety by raising unlimited amounts from private donors, Congressional Republicans are moving to rein in the groups — just in time for the November midterm elections. Leading Democrats are threatening a fight.</p>
<p>In the House, the Republican leadership intends to bring a plan to impose new restrictions on 527 groups to the floor next week to spur action in the Senate, where Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, a champion of the campaign finance bill that bears his name, is offering similar legislation.</p>
<p>"I think this leaves a gaping loophole in the McCain-Feingold campaign finance bill," the House majority leader, Representative John A. Boehner, Republican of Ohio, told reporters on Thursday, referring to a bill co-sponsored by Senator Russell D. Feingold, Democrat of Wisconsin. "I think it needs to be fixed."</p>
<p>But Mr. Boehner's Democratic counterpart, Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, denounced the effort, saying that Republicans could draw unlimited money from wealthy corporations and trade associations that used their own nonprofit arms to wage issue campaigns.</p>
<p>Both Mr. McCain and the House leaders want to limit annual donations to 527 groups and force them to abide by the more stringent rules governing political committees if they are active in federal races. </p>
<p>A federal district judge in Washington this week also called for action, ruling that the Federal Election Commission had "failed to present a reasoned explanation" for not requiring 527 groups to register as political committees. The judge, Emmet G. Sullivan, ordered the commission either to articulate its reasoning for evaluating 527 complaints on a case-by-case basis, or to "promulgate a rule, if necessary."</p>
<p>But even if the campaign to stamp out 527 groups succeeds, it may not greatly impede third-party involvement in political campaigns, which is flourishing as advocacy groups adapt and discover ever more creative ways to pour their contributions into the political process. </p>
<p>Independent organizations are already working on behalf of candidates in both parties, rallying support behind issues, canvassing for voters and preparing for big-money efforts, with many steering clear of the 527 approach. And some of the deep-pocketed 527 groups that were active in 2004 are so far on the sidelines.</p>

<p>"Unless and until they actually manage to repeal the First Amendment itself, we are going to find a way to give voice to the tens of thousands of people who share our views and want to have a voice in the political process," said Pat Toomey, president of the Club for Growth, an antitax group that has been sued by the  election commission over the conduct of its 527 in a 2004 Senate race.</p>
<p>The 527 groups drew intense scrutiny after Swift Boat Veterans for Truth ran its campaign attacking the war record of the Democratic presidential nominee, Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts. But while Swift Boats drew the spotlight, the liberal philanthropist George Soros nearly single-handedly redefined the scope of campaign finance by contributing millions to progressive groups like MoveOn.</p>
<p> So while candidates of both parties suffered at the hands of 527 committees, the drive to limit them is being pushed largely by Republicans who fear that Democratic advantages among the groups could swamp some of their candidates.</p>
<p>"It is the Loch Ness monster in 527 form, rising out of the mist to eat them," scoffed Robert Bauer, an election law specialist opposed to the proposed restrictions on 527 committees.</p>
<p>After 2004, the Federal Election Commission scrutinized some 527 groups and sued Club for Growth. The result, said Kenneth A. Gross, a campaign finance lawyer, was that "527's have been demonized to some extent," prompting many outside advocacy groups to rely on another provision of the tax code, 501c(4), which governs nonprofit groups. </p>
<p>Business and trade associations typically operate under a similar provision, 501c(6). As a bonus, the 501c groups are not required to disclose their donors, as 527 groups are.</p>
<p>Tony Massaro, executive vice president for political affairs at the League of Conservation Voters, said his group relied on its 501c(4) status because it could push directly for the election of specific candidates right up to Election Day, since the group takes no union or corporate money. Were it a 527, the advertisements would have to skirt that issue and strike a fuzzier theme of urging voters to contact candidates about their positions on divisive issues — a gimmick that Mr. Massaro said comported with the law but left the public cold.</p>
<p>"Voters get frustrated by that game," said Mr. Massaro, who said his organization would spend $3 million to $5 million and was already working on behalf of Democratic Senate candidates in Florida, Pennsylvania and Washington.</p>

<p>Brad Woodhouse, a spokesman for Americans United, a 501c(4) group, said that category allowed his organization to work closely with like-minded Democrats in shaping its advocacy program, including its current push for changes in Medicare's new prescription drug program. Such contact that would be prohibited for a 527. </p>
<p>Representative Mike Pence, an Indiana Republican who is an opponent of restraining 527 committees, likened the current atmosphere to whack-a-mole, the carnival game where the player hits a mole with a hammer, only to have another pop up. He is backing legislation that would raise limits on contributions to political parties — an idea that opponents say would gut previous reforms.</p>
<p>"We hit political parties and 527's pop up," Mr. Pence said. "We're going to whack them and 501c's are going to pop up."</p>
<p>Despite the current dip in 527 activity, some new ones are being established, including one opposing Senator Rick Santorum, a conservative Republican in a tough re-election race in Pennsylvania. Veteran Democratic operatives just established a new group called Fresh Start for America, which is expected to engage in Senate races this year. </p>
<p>As lawmakers prepare for a potential fight, Mr. Pariser of MoveOn.org said there could be one unexpected consequence. He suggested the effort to clamp down on 527 groups could enhance the influence of his organization because it would have the financial means to mount aggressive campaigns while potential competing groups would be handcuffed.</p>
<p>"We will be better positioned to do political ads," he said. "I presume that was not their intent." </p>
