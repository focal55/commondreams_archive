<p>ATHENS  - A double anger erupted out of the <a href="http://www.fse-esf.org/" target="_new">European Social 
Forum</a> on to the streets of Athens Saturday. Anti-globalization 
protesters attacked police and multinational targets, alongside local 
groups protesting injustice to immigrants.

The two came together naturally at the European Social Forum (ESF) that 
began Thursday. ESF participants had planned a large demonstration 
through Athens for Saturday afternoon. The police were expecting 
trouble, but were still caught off guard.
<p>
The center of Athens was cordoned off all afternoon by heavy police 
contingents. Government buildings and the embassies of the United States 
and Britain were under visibly heavy protection.
<p>
It was a small group from the demonstration, believed to be the 
Anarchists. The police said at the end of the day that two of their 
vehicles were damaged by petrol bombs. Petrol bombs also damaged a 
Citibank building, the police said.
<p>
The attacks had clearly been planned beforehand. Other groups emerged 
from the side streets on Ermou street, the most fashionable shopping 
center in Athens. They attacked stores, particularly those of 
multinational chains such as McDonald's and Lacoste. Several glass panes 
were smashed along the street in hit and run attacks.
<p>
Anti-globalization anarchists picked their predictable targets, but the 
demonstrators' anger was clearly fueled by the government's anti-
immigration policies that keep close to a million people in a population 
of 10 million without rights and without status.
<p>

The majority of migrants who live in Greece without status are Albanians 
and Pakistanis. The demonstrators Saturday included large numbers of 
Albanians and clearly thousands of Pakistanis.
<p>
"We have not engaged in any violence," a Pakistani demonstrator said at 
the end of the rally. "We do not know who did this," he added. No one 
else in the group of Pakistanis around him was ready to discuss the 
violence.
<p>
Under Greek law -- or the lack of it -- almost no migrant is given 
citizenship, or even residence rights. Migrants have in effect become a 
cheap and vulnerable labour force for jobs that Greeks are either unable 
or unwilling to do.
<p>
"This economy cannot function without us," the Pakistani youth 
said. "But what are they giving us? Nothing."
<p>
The illegality issue had been waiting to surface at the European Social 
Forum. 
<p>
According to local reports, Italian Member of the European Parliament 
Giusto Catania, Synaspismos Left Coalition MP Panayiotis Lafazanis and 
prominent human rights lawyer Ioanna Kourtovik were detained when they 
led a group of ESF supporters into a police station to protest against 
inhuman conditions in which illegal immigrants are detained.
<p>
At the European Social Forum center, this has emerged as the dominant 
issue. Several civil society and left groups not directly involved with 
immigration issues have been coming together to back demands by migrant 
groups for justice at last for migrants who have lived without status 
for a generation, and for a new generation that has grown up without 
status.
<p>
The heavy Albanian and Pakistani presence among the demonstrators 
brought immediacy to calls for justice under the slogan 'Another Europe 
is Possible'.
<p>
"We have to get justice for migrants because none of the political 
parties are taking this up," said a young demonstrator. She held up a 
banner which she said meant 'It's late enough already; time for justice 
now'. 

<p>
Other demonstrators carried banners against U.S. President George W. 
Bush. Several demonstrators raised slogans against the Iraq war.
<p>
The anti-war sentiment also found natural support among the Pakistanis 
and Albanians among the demonstrators, both Muslim groups. Several among 
the demonstrators threw stones at the British embassy building in 
central Athens.
<p>
The ESF seems to have put together a cocktail of anger. Some of the 
anger was against the Greek, the U.S. and the British governments over 
the war in Iraq, some followed a tradition of anti-globalization 
protests that began at a meeting of the G8 (leading eight industrialized 
nations - the United States, Canada, Britain, France, Germany, Italy, 
Russia and Japan), and some of it was over the denial of rights to 
migrants living in Greece.
<p>
But together it marked a change for the ESF where it was thought the 
like-minded gather to talk about what they already agree on. The 
militancy that arose from this ESF could be a signal that the social 
forum movement is now prepared to go much further than talking - and not 
through Anarchists alone.
