<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->MADISON, Wisconsin - Some Air America supporters held a fake funeral procession Wednesday, saying that a Madison radio station pulling the plug on the liberal Air America Radio programming is the "Death of the free speech."<p>A small group of supporters of the Mic 92.1 FM put signs that read "The death of free speech" on their backpacks, car dashboards, bumpers and windows for the procession.<p></p><!--/beginimage/-->

The fake funeral procession was also marked with black crepe paper, supporters said to indicate a somber occasion as a local station prepares to shut down liberal talk radio in the area.<p></p>One driver in the mock processional, Judy Skog, of Madison, said she is devastated by the news that her favorite station is losing the programming she loves.<p></p>"I can't stand right-wing talk radio. Other than public radio, this is the only radio I listen to," Skog said.<p></p>"I'm just real sorry to see this station go off the air, or essentially go off the air, change its format," said Jeff Lange, of Madison, who attended the mock procession.<p></p>With their car radios tuned to 92.1 FM, about 30 people in 15 cars drove with their lights flashing to the source of their disappointment -- the local version of radio giant Clear Channel Radio.<p></p>Supporters rolled into the front office parking lot on Wednesday, car after car, carrying one message: Don't dump The Mic's Air America Radio network, hosted by liberals like Al Franken.<p></p>They were greeted by Clear Channel FM Operations Manager Mike Ferris.  The group presented him with a petition with over 4,500 signatures asking Clear Channel to keep Madison's only liberal talk radio station and not replace it with an all-sports format from Fox Radio.<p></p>Clear Channel managers have said in the past that the decision was based on audience research and a lack of advertisers.<p></p>"We are hearing your voices, and your voice has been heard. We appreciate you coming out and supporting this," Ferris said as he accepted the petition.<p></p>Ferris was cordial but refused further comment. The doors to the offices were locked and a police officer was visible inside, WISC-TV reported.<p></p>Protest leaders said they believe Clear Channel is committed to sticking with its format change but remain hopeful.<p></p>That's because AM station WTDY has agreed to take over the Mic's locally produced shows, and organizers said they are working with some investors and a Milwaukee group to possibly buy a radio station.<p></p>Lead organizer Valerie Walasek said the efforts to keep liberal talk on local airwaves have only just begun.<p></p>"We're going to keep working until we have a permanent community voice on progressive radio in Madison," Walasek said.<p></p>The Mic plans to change to sports Jan. 1. Meantime, key Air America Radio investor and local businessman Terry Kelly is working with a new group to try to get the network out of financial crisis.<p></p>
"I continue to work diligently with the new proposed partner and am optimistic we'll have an announcement shortly after the New Year," Kelly said.
