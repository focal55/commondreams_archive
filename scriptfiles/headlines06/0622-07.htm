Chief executive officers in the United
States earned 262 times the pay of an average worker in 2005,
the second-highest level in the 40 years for which there is
data, a nonprofit think-tank said on Wednesday.
<p>In fact, a CEO earned more in one workday than an average
worker earned in 52 weeks, said the <a href="http://www.epinet.org">Economic Policy Institute</a>in Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>The typical worker's compensation averaged just under
&#36;42,000 for the year, while the average CEO brought home almost
&#36;11 million, EPI said.</p>
<p>In recent years, compensation has been a hot issue with
shareholders who have been bombarded with news stories about
chief executives who are given multimillion dollar bonus and
pay packages even if shares have declined.</p>
<p>For example, the chief executives of 11 of the largest
companies were awarded a total of &#36;865 million in pay in the
last two years, even as they presided over a total loss of &#36;640
billion in shareholder value, a recent study from governance
firm the Corporate Library, found.</p>
<p>In 1965, U.S. CEOs at major companies earned 24 times a
worker's pay. That ratio surged in the 1990s and hit 300 at the
end of the recovery in 2000, according to EPI.</p>
<p>CEO pay is defined by the sum of salary, bonus, value of
restricted stock at grant and other long-term incentives.
Worker pay is hourly wage of production and nonsupervisory
works, EPI said.
