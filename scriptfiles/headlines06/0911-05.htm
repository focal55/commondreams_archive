The angry protester accusing Tony Blair of complicity in the recent Israeli bombardment of Lebanon disrupted the news conference and thousands more shouted outside Monday as the British prime minister visited Beirut in a show of support for the devastated nation's government. She held a banner that said 'Boycott Israeli apartheid', and shouted 'This visit is an insult' in front of live TV cameras until security guards holding her by her arms and legs carried her out.

A woman protester paraded in front of him and Lebanese Premier Fuad Siniora 
  as they staged a joint press conference in Beirut, waving a banner and 
  shouting: "This is an insult to the families of thousands of Lebanese who 
  have died. Shame on you, shame on you, Mr Blair."
</p>
<p>
  As security guards bundled her away, both Mr Blair and Mr Siniora appealed 
  for calm.
</p>
<p>

  The lone protest matched that of others in the streets of Beirut, with 
  demonstrators infuriated by Mr Blair's refusal to call for an immediate 
  ceasefire from Israel in the bloody conflict which raged in July.
</p>
<p>
  Downing Street had been braced for expressions of anger and after the press 
  conference Mr Blair's official spokesman said: "We expected there would be 
  protests, although not at the press conference."
</p>
<p>
  The dramatic demonstration upstaged Mr Blair's announcement of a &pound;40 million 
  aid package for Lebanon, during what was always a high-risk finale to his 
  Middle East tour.
</p>
<p>
  Britain is to give &pound;22.3 million to rebuild Lebanon's shattered 
  infrastructure, including help with six emergency bridges needed to replace 
  those destroyed by the Israelis, and will pump a further &pound;20 million into 
  funding the international stability force in the south of the country.

</p>
<p>
  Mr Blair was also challenged at the press conference over reports that 
  weapons for the Israeli bombardment of Lebanon had been transported through 
  the UK, and challenged on whether he had "blood on his hands" because of his 
  stance.
</p>
<p>
  Mr Blair - who said the demonstration has made him feel "at home" - 
  insisted: "There have not actually been transport of weapons for any means, 
  but that's not really the point.
</p>
<p>
  "The point is this. You have just seen a demonstration by somebody who's 
  opposed to my visit and opposed to my policy. The most important thing we 
  believed throughout the entirety of the crisis was to work to get a United 
  Nations resolution which was the only possibility of stopping the conflict."
</p>
<p>
  Mr Blair went on: "The most important thing for the future is we stand with 
  you and rebuild, but we won't be able to do that unless we deal with the 
  root causes of what's happened.
</p>

<p>
  "The reason I wanted to come here is not because I'm unaware that there are 
  people who deeply object to the policies we have - I wanted to hear from the 
  Prime Minister how we can help for the future."
</p>
<p>
  Hezbollah members of Mr Siniora's administration - who reject the state of 
  Israel - had already boycotted today's talks with Mr Blair.
</p>
<p>
  But challenged once more during the press conference on his stance, the 
  Prime Minister said: "Let me again express my condolences to those who lost 
  their lives and those in Israel too.
</p>
<p>
  "If we end up with the solution for Israel and Palestine, there will be two 
  signatures on the final status agreement.
</p>
<p>

  "One will be Palestinian and the other will be Israeli and therefore we are 
  not going to resolve this conflict except on a just basis, which means two 
  states living side by side and by accepting that each state has the right to 
  exist."
</p>
<p>
  Asked again if he felt shame for his stance, Mr Blair insisted: "There never 
  was going to be a cessation unless it was done on the basis of a UN 
  resolution. That's the reality, that's what I worked for throughout.
</p>
<p>
  "I have got used to demonstrations in my country and elsewhere so I suppose 
  demonstrations here kind of make me feel at home."
</p>
<p>
  Challenged whether he had "blood on his hands", Mr Blair replied: "In the 
  end you have got to make a judgment on this. It's a great sign of democracy 
  that you have people with a different point of view."
</p>
<p>
  But he went on: "Things we want to achieve can't be achieved without America 
  and Israel."

</p>
<p>
  Mr Blair added: "Feelings run high, of course feelings run high. Innocent 
  people have lost their lives here.
</p>
<p>
  "This country that was on its way to being a model for the region has been 
  set back many years - of course feelings run high.
</p>
<p>
  "But what can we do? This conflict was never going to end without a UN 
  resolution.
</p>
<p>
  "In the end I'm here to get things done. I believe there is a way out of the 
  problems of the Middle East but it can only be done if we are prepared to 
  put in the political work and commitment to get a resolution of the 
  underlying issues.
</p>

<p>
  "If we don't do that, as people here know better than any other people in 
  the region, then conflict will come again and innocent people will be its 
  victims."
</p>
<p>
  Mr Siniora said: "Let's look at the future. Let's see what we can do. Mr 
  Blair can play a role."
</p>
<p>
  British sources said later that the protester was believed to be an Irish 
  aid agency worker.
