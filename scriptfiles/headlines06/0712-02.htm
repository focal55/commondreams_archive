The <a href="http://www.aclu.org">American Civil Liberties Union</a> announced yesterday  that it was withdrawing controversial proposals that would have limited the ability of its board members to criticize the organization publicly.
<p>The proposals had attracted widespread criticism from board members, donors and editorial boards around the country, which regarded them as hypocritical in light of the A.C.L.U.&#8217;s historic defense of free speech.</p>
<p>In a statement posted on the group&#8217;s Web site,   Nadine Strossen, the board president, said the proposals were being withdrawn by the committee that had proposed them as part of an effort to define the rights and responsibilities of board members.</p>

<p>&#8220;The committee has now decided to withdraw certain passages from the proposed guidelines that were strongly criticized by many board members, as well as by Executive Director Anthony Romero and other staff members,&#8221; Ms. Strossen said, &#8220;on the grounds that those passages might have some chilling effect on board members&#8217; freedom of speech and dissent (even though that was not the committee&#8217;s intent).&#8221; </p>
<p>Lawrence A. Hamermesh, the chairman of the committee, said it had decided to withdraw the proposals, which had been supported by 9 of its 10 members, after it became clear at a board meeting on June 17  that members were concerned about them. &#8220;The committee will evaluate what, if anything, should replace them,&#8221; Mr. Hamermesh said.</p>
<p>Norman Siegel, a civil rights lawyer who headed the A.C.L.U.&#8217;s New York affiliate for almost a quarter of century, criticized the proposals in an op-ed article in The Daily News on Monday.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m very pleased that the committee has withdrawn its proposals from consideration, but the all-important question still remains: How could such proposals get this far at, of all places, the American Civil Liberties Union?&#8221; Mr. Siegel said in a telephone interview. &#8220;The leadership should have dismissed them immediately when they were first presented.&#8221;</p>
<p>Robert Chester, a board member who served on the committee and supported the proposals, said he had no problem with the decision to withdraw them and emphasized that they had always been intended as guidelines, not as policies. </p>
<p>&#8220;This is consistent with the general practice of the board to send proposals back to committee for reformulation,&#8221; Mr. Chester said.</p>
<p>Other board members had argued that if the board had discussed the proposals numbered line by line and voted on them, they would have become policy and thus used in conjunction with the organization&#8217;s bylaws in efforts  to determine whether board members should be sanctioned for violations of their  duties.</p>
<p>Rob Remar, for example, &#8220;stated that if the committee&#8217;s objective is to have a document that goes to new board members that sets out collectively what the board considers to be the obligations of board members, it ought to be adopted by the board and therefore it ought to be numbered and ought to be discussed as policy,&#8221; according to minutes of the January executive committee meeting where the proposals  were first discussed.</p>

<p> At the  meeting last month, the board twice voted down motions to strike the proposals from the rights and responsibilities committee&#8217;s report. Emily Whitfield, an A.C.L.U. spokeswoman, said at the time that the failure of the motions was not an endorsement of the proposals but rather an effort to follow the board&#8217;s normal deliberative processes.</p>
<p>The board has not discussed the matter since then. </p>
