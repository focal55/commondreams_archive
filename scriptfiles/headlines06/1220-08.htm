<p>British Prime Minister Tony Blair was in favor of announcing a timetable to pull troops out of Iraq, but was "brainwashed" out of it by President George W. Bush, Iraq's vice president said on Tuesday.</p><p>     Vice President Tareq al-Hashemi told New York's Council on Foreign Relations that when he spoke with Blair about three months ago, the British leader was supportive of his appeal for the United States and Britain to say when they would withdraw.</p><p>     "I had just convinced him," Hashemi said. "He promised he was going to discuss the subject with President Bush, but at the end of the day, it's quite unfortunate, that your president (made) some sort of brainwashing of Mr. Blair."</p><p>     But Hashemi also said any withdrawal of troops should be conditional on U.S. training of Iraq's security forces.</p><p>     Blair, who visited Baghdad on Sunday, defended on Tuesday his nation's close U.S. alliance in response to an influential British think tank's report that found the relationship has damaged Britain's credibility in the Middle East.</p><p>     Hashemi, in comments to Reuters after his Council on Foreign Relations address, said that Blair had been "open-minded" about announcing a troop pullout.</p><p>     "He promised me to take this message to Mr. Bush, in fact, and he said 'I'm going to support that'," he said.</p><p>     Hashemi said announcing a timetable for the withdrawal of American, British and other troops would help bring together warring Sunni and Shi'ite factions.</p><p>     "The problem is the timetable withdrawal. If you announce that tomorrow, the problem is going to be mitigated," he said.</p><p>     "The American troops, the American administration should be committed with a timetable conditional withdrawal from Iraq. This is very important."</p><p>     But Hashemi added that the United States had made a commitment to Iraq, any therefore withdrawal of troops should be conditional on the training of Iraq's own security forces.</p><p>     He blamed the sectarian tensions in his country on "foreign interference."</p><p>     The Iraq Study Group, a bipartisan panel of former senior U.S. officials, recommended this month that Bush withdraw most U.S. forces from combat in Iraq by early 2008 and focus instead on training Iraqi forces.</p><p>     The report has increased pressure on Bush to find a way out of a war that started with the U.S.-led invasion in March, 2003, and has killed more than 2,900 U.S. troops and tens of thousands of Iraqis.</p>
