Thousands of Shiites in Baghdad's Sadr City slum rallied against the recent attacks that left over a hundred dead, chanting slogans against U.S. Ambassador Zalmay Khalizad and Sunni Arab leaders, especially hardliners that have been complaining of widespread fraud during the Dec. 15 elections.

"My son was our only source of income," said the
48-year-old woman, dressed in black like hundreds of people in
this holy Shi'ite city who are mourning their beloved ones.</p>
<p>"Now we have lost him my family will suffer," she said,
explaining how her 21-year-old son Ali was working as a peddler
in a market next to the golden-domed Imam Hussein shrine when
the bomber struck.</p>
<p>"We have nobody to support us," she said as worshippers and
pilgrims began arriving at the shrine for Friday prayers and
the burial of the victims. "Do they call killing poor people
resistance?"</p>
<p>Black banners condemning the bombing hung from buildings
around the shrine as shopkeepers continued to sift through the
debris at the bomb site, inspecting the remains of their
burnt-out shops and stalls.</p>
<p>No one has claimed responsibility for the attack but no one
in Kerbala doubted it was carried out by Sunni militants who
have declared a holy war on Iraq's Shi'ite majority.</p>
<p>"They want to harm us because we are Shi'ites. They hate
us," said Takeya Mohammed as she sat in a nearby medical center
tending her son and husband, who were among the 148 injured.</p>
<p>Some mourners said the assault was clearly a reprisal
against Shi'ites for their victory in last month's election,
which some Sunni Arabs and secular politicians say was
fraudulent and is being investigated.</p>
<p>ATTACK CONDEMNED</p>

<p>Senior Shi'ite clerics condemned the attack but, as they
have after so many previous atrocities, urged their followers
not to retaliate.</p>
<p>But for some Shi'ites, like Kerbala resident Mohammad Abbas
Haidar, these calls for restraint were as exasperating as the
bombings themselves. The time has come for Shi'ites to defend
themselves, he said.</p>
<p>"This is too much," he said. "I wish they would give me the
green light to fight these people and teach them a lesson."</p>
<p>Shopkeeper Jabbar Nasr agreed.</p>
<p>"Sunnis were behind this criminal act. I call on our
religious Shi'ite institutions to give us permission to fight
back," he said angrily. "How long should we remain silent?"</p>
<p>Shi'ite political leaders were outraged by the bombings,
one of several which have killed around 180 people in Iraq over
the past three days.</p>
<p>On Thursday, one senior Shi'ite official described the
attacks as "an open war" against his sect.</p>
<p>Residents in Kerbala said they believed the bombers were
trying to pressure the next government, which will be dominated
by Islamist Shi'ites, to give in to Sunni campaigning for
senior cabinet positions.</p>
<p>"What happened here was a warning to Shi'ite parties and
the government that all Shi'ite provinces will face the same if
they do not give in to Sunni demands," said Kasem Zain, 27.

<p>
Ali Mohammed Kadhem, a 40-year-old trader, also said the
bombing was the fault of Sunni political parties.
<p>
"They always claim that they are sidelined from the
political process and this is the result of their complaints."
