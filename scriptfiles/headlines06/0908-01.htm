<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->Robert Greenwald didn't intend to develop a new film-distribution system.<BR><BR> But as his career has turned from producing movies of the week to directing left-leaning documentaries, that has been the outcome. He and his company, Brave New Films, have slowly been developing, film by film, an alternative to the typical small-film path to the public of film festival and, if lucky, art-house showings.<BR><BR>     When Greenwald's new film, "Iraq for Sale: The War Profiteers," goes up for sale on DVD at the end of this month, millions of people will already know about it, a lot of them through the network of progressive mailing lists that Greenwald's Brave New Films has been able to tap.<BR><BR> Tens of thousands will already be signed up for a series of independent screenings, most of them in people's homes, the week of Oct. 8. And some smaller number than that will have seen it in a very limited theatrical play, which started this week in New York and Los Angeles.<BR><BR> More than that, his newest film -- following critical takes on Wal-Mart, Fox News Channel and Iraq war coverage -- was paid for the same way Howard Dean paid for his presidential campaign, through a direct appeal on the Internet for contributions, however small. The company raised $368,000 in eight days, it says, from just over 3,000 people.<BR><BR> "Essentially, what we're doing is alternative distribution," Greenwald says. "What that means is we don't put our focus on getting into movie theaters or film festivals. Our focus is on being part of groups that are working for social change around the issue. With each film, we've learned more and more."<BR><BR> This is the first time he has released a film, for instance, after the explosions of MySpace and YouTube, and "Iraq for Sale," billed as "what happens to everyday Americans when corporations go to war," is attempting to make the most of those sites. It's got a page up on the former (cheekily listing Vice President Dick Cheney and conservative media czar Rupert Murdoch as "friends"), and it has seeded the latter with a couple of trailers and some extra material that didn't make the final cut.<BR><BR> "We are not just content to sit back and try to grow our e-mail list," says Sarah Feeley, the company's production head and a Winnetka native. "We've got to create a mechanism for bringing younger people into the mix."<BR><BR> "The landscape's changed tremendously," she says. "The advent of YouTube has completely changed the playing field."<BR><BR> For "Wal-Mart: The High Cost of Low Price," from last fall, the company did some satirical ads that spread virally. "But we did it primarily through our own Web site and through our e-mail blasts," Feeley says. "With YouTube it takes on a life of its own much more quickly."<BR><BR> <BR><BR> Making connections<BR><BR> Brave New Films has developed its own, potentially invaluable tool, as well. Called Brave New Theaters, and developed in-house by producer Jim Gilliam, "it's a combination of My-Space and Evite and Moviefone all mushed together," says Feeley, with the primary aim of connecting people willing to host screenings to those wanting to attend. There's also a space to talk about the films afterward.<BR><BR> Proclaiming, "your ticket to the people-powered movie revolution starts here," the site (at bravenewtheaters.com) isn't just for Greenwald films. Anyone with a movie to push can sign on, Gilliam says, and the price, the site says, is "cheaper than tube socks at Wal-Mart."<BR><BR> How much cheaper? "It's free. We want to make you money . . . and uh, wreak a little havoc on the corporate media," the site says.<BR><BR> "The goal behind it is to take everything about the movie business and try to turn it into something completely democratized," says Gilliam, the former chief technology officer at business.com.<BR><BR> The hub of "Iraq for Sale," though, is the Web site (iraqforsale.org). When the contemporary assumption is that everything has a Web site, it's especially important for a film being distributed, essentially, via the Internet to have a strong presence.<BR><BR> In addition to showing a clip and offering now-standard areas, such as "About the Movie," "Do Something!" and "Reviews &amp; Buzz," there's a beefed-up section called "Facts and Research."<BR><BR> <BR><BR> Links to articles<BR><BR> In much the same way the first-rate PBS Web site supplements what viewers see on the air, the links in "Facts and Research" are to articles and reports that go into depth. It's especially important with "Iraq for Sale" because the film's focus on the ordinary people affected -- once-patriotic truck drivers who now question their country after driving for private firms in Iraq, soldiers forced to train Halliburton employees to do their jobs -- will likely leave some viewers wanting more in the way of intellectual, rather than just emotional, connection.<BR><BR> "The last time, with `Wal-Mart,' we were kind of caught a little bit by surprise at how people were looking for information on the Web site," Greenwald says. "This time we've really filled it chock-full of stuff from the beginning."<BR><BR> To hear Greenwald describe it, his evolution as a film distributor happened sort of by accident. Some of it was by necessity of wanting to get timely films out when they could do some good; "Iraq for Sale," for instance, had to be out this month so it would have a chance to have an impact on the November elections, he says.<BR><BR> But a lot of the development came due to the coincidence of his documentary career paralleling the rise of the Internet as a social connector.<BR><BR> With his first documentary, "Uncovered," about the Iraq war in the media, "we thought we'd sell 1,000 copies. We sold 25,000. But it was `pushing out' &#091;the film&#093; in the traditional sense. Now more and more, it's becoming peer to peer.<BR><BR> "I said, `Here are these groups that work on the Internet. Here are these groups that know how to do screenings. Let's put 'em together.'"<BR><BR> So what started as a by-the-way on the mailing list of a group such as MoveOn.org has now moved farther and wider, to the point where a new Greenwald film is, itself, a rallying point for progressives.<BR><BR> "What I love about this is it's very democratic," Greenwald says. "You can't make it happen."
