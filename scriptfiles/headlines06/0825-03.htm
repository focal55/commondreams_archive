        <!--/endimage/-->The 49-year-old Democrat and  labor movement activist renewed  calls for a debate with Clinton as he  made campaign stops, including  Spot Coffee on Delaware Avenue,  and met with The Buffalo News editorial board. <P>     Tasini, who acknowledged lagging far behind Clinton in name  recognition and support, said he believes the senator's voting record in  support of the war is out of step  with most Democrats in the state. <P>   &quot;I believe the  war was foolish, illegal, immoral - it  should never have  been fought. It cost  the lives of 2,600  wonderful American men and women, tens of thousands of Iraqis,  destroyed a country  and probably left us  with a legacy of anger from the Muslim world that  could go on for, potentially, generations,&quot; Tasini said. 
<P>     &quot;I believe on that alone Hillary  Clinton does not deserve re-election.&quot; <P>     Attempts to get a response from  the Clinton campaign Thursday  were unsuccessful. <P>     Tasini said he favors legislation  in the House that calls for a &quot;safe  and immediate withdrawal of  troops,&quot; who would be replaced by  an international security force. <P>      The self-described &quot;internationalist&quot; criticized Clinton's support for  the North American Free Trade  Agreement, which he said has ravaged upstate New York. He said he  would support only trade agreements that safeguard environmental and labor standards. 
<P>     As part of his economic plan,  Tasini would push for single-payer  health insurance. <P>     &quot;We need, from a moral and economic standpoint, to take drug and  insurance companies out of the  [health-care] business,&quot; Tasini said. <P>     His plan also includes massive  investment in alternative energy  and imposing a quarter-percent  &quot;fairness tax&quot; on long-term Wall  Street investors that he said could  raise $100 billion to improve the  country's infrastructure. <P>     Tasini said he believes his ideas  could attract legions of supporters  with more exposure. But with   </p>

</font><BR> </B></FONT>$200,000 raised for his campaign, dwarfed by Clinton's more  than $20 million, he is counting on  a debate, although none is scheduled, to level the playing field. <P>     &quot;I'm the eternal optimist. Sixty-five percent of the people say they  still don't know who I am. So a debate is very important, both for the  voters and for the campaign,&quot; he  said. <P>     The candidate said he is not surprised that the online grass-roots  organizations that helped propel  anti-war candidate Ned Lamont to  victory over Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman in the recent Connecticut  Democratic Party primary have  kept him at arm's length. <P>     Tasini said he understands that  organizations are reluctant to lose  access to someone they view as a national leader when  the alternative  could mean being  kept on the sidelines. <P>     While hailing  Lamont's victory,  he said the multimillionaire could  not have succeeded without pouring money into his own campaign.  He also said Lieberman &quot;is a cut  worse than [Clinton]&quot; on the issues. <P>     Tasini, who led the National  Writers Union for 13 years, was  born in the United States. His father  was born in what is now Israel, and  his mother fled Poland to escape the  Holocaust. He has criticized Israel's  air war in Lebanon as &quot;disproportionate,&quot; a charge leveled Friday by  Amnesty International. Clinton rejects that charge. <P>     &quot;Hillary Clinton is not a friend of  Israel. A true friend of Israel knows  when to speak up and say I love you  but you're wrong,&quot; Tasini said. <P>     &quot;Hillary's sole goal is speaking  about this issue to win Jewish votes,  and that is not the way you go about  it as a national leader.&quot; <P>     While Tasini moved through  Buffalo largely unrecognized, he  found some supporters along the  way, including Zeb Syed of Buffalo. 
<P>     &quot;I think Jonathan will be helpful  in stopping the war in Iraq and  overseeing where so much of our resources are going,&quot; Syed said at Spot  Coffee.
