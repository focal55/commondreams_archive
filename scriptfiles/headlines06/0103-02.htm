<p>Support for President George W. Bush's Iraq policy has fallen among the US armed forces to just 54 percent from 63 percent a year ago, according to a poll by the magazine group Military Times.</p>
<p>In its annual survey of the views of military personnel, the group reported on its <a href="http://www.militarycity.com/polls/2005_main.php" target="_new">website</a> that support for Bush's overall policies dropped over the past year to 60 percent from 71 percent.</p>
<p>While still significantly more supportive of the president than the broad US population, the fall in support by military personnel tracks a similar decline in the president's popularity among the general public.</p>
<p>"Though support both for President Bush and for the war in Iraq remains significantly higher than in the public as a whole, the drop is likely to add further fuel to the heated debate over Iraq policy," Military Times said.</p>
<p>"In 2003 and 2004, supporters of the war in Iraq pointed to high approval ratings in the Military Times poll as a signal that military members were behind ... the president's policy."</p>
<p>However, it said, the new poll "found diminished optimism that US goals in Iraq can be accomplished, and a somewhat smaller drop in support for the decision to go to war in 2003."</p>

<p>Military Times, which publishes popular magazines for each of the US military branches including Army Times and Navy Times, cautioned that its poll, of 1,215 active-duty servicemen, is not necessarily representative of the military as a whole.</p>
<p>The respondents were "on average older, more experienced, more likely to be officers and more career-oriented than the military population."</p>
<p>But the declining numbers for Bush tracked other polls. According to the CNN/USA Today/Gallup Poll, support for Bush's performance as president fell from 49 percent to 43 percent over the year to December 22.</p>
<p>The Military Times poll also showed a significant decline in the armed forces' views of US military policy and management.</p>
<p>With 61 percent of respondents saying they had served in Iraq or Afghanistan, only 58 percent believed that Bush had the military's best interests at heart, a sharp decline from 69 percent a year before. </p>
<p>Only 56 percent felt the US should have gone to war in Iraq, compared to 60 percent a year before.</p>
<p>And 64 percent felt the same about the Pentagon leadership, compared to 70 percent a year ago.</p>
<p>Addressing key issues facing the Pentagon, the poll showed that almost two-thirds of the soldiers felt the US military is "stretched too thin to be effective", but the number was less than a year ago.</p>
<p>At the same time, there was a fall in resistance to restoring the draft in the United States. Opposition fell from 75 percent a year ago to 68 percent this year.</p>
