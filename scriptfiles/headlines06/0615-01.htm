<p> MONT-TREMBLANT, Quebec - "Father knows best" isn't just an old TV show any more — it's where Canada and the U.S. beg to differ, according to Environics pollster Michael Adams. 
<P></P>And the difference between Canadian and American attitudes toward big daddy may reveal something larger about how to rebuild the centre-left of the political spectrum in Canada — a task now under way at a big, "progressive politics" conference at the Mont-Tremblant resort.<P></P>The conference also drew former U.S. vice-president Al Gore to talk last night about Canada-U.S. attitudinal divides on the environment. <P></P> One of Adams' most stunning illustrations of Canada-U.S. differences to the conference was on the question of family dynamics —— specifically the idea of the father as head of the family. <P></P>In Canada, that notion has been slowly eroding since 1992. In the United States, it's been growing. <P></P>In 1992, 26 per cent of Canadians said they agreed with the statement: "The father of the family must be the master of his own house." In 2005, only 18 per cent of Canadians agree with that notion, according to Adams' numbers. <P></P>By contrast, 42 per cent of Americans agreed with that statement in 1992. But by 2005, more than half of Americans — 52 per cent — said that dad must be the boss at home. <P></P>"If my wife heard that, she'd be mad at Americans. Heck, she'd be mad at me," joked Liberal party president Mike Eizenga, who's one of about 150 delegates to this week's Canada 2020 conference.<P></P>Conference attendees were excited by the Adams' finding.<P></P>They believed it underscores the idea that Canadians are far more wary overall of authoritarianism, hierarchy and other hallmarks of conservative politics. <P></P>Some pundits, in fact, have taken to calling Prime Minister Stephen Harper "big daddy" for his tough, highly centralized style of governing since he took office in February.<P></P>His perceived weakness on the environment is also seen as an opening for his centre-left opponents, whether Liberal, New Democrat, Bloc Québécois, Green or, in some cases, U.S. Democrats. <P></P>Gore, arriving at the conference last night amid huge fanfare, stopped briefly to tell reporters that he was encouraged by talk of "progressive" politics in Canada, especially if it encompasses a renewed push on the environment. Gore is currently touring to promote his new movie on climate change. <P></P>Gore told the conference last night he was worried Canada would head down the same road politically as the United States.<P></P>"I love Canada and I am surprised when I hear some in national positions here say things are broken. <P></P>``Some of us look at Canada and say, `My God, things work so well,'" Gore said. <P></P>At a private reception with some of the conference organizers and Liberal MPs and senators, Gore was reportedly more expansive about what he sees as the Canada-U.S. differences on the environment.<P></P>He also heard some warning words from the Canadians about the direction of the Harper government — specifically, its announced intention to back away from the Kyoto air quality protocol in favour of a yet-to-be-devised "made in Canada" plan. <P></P>Former deputy prime minister John Manley, one of the chairs of the conference, said of his conversation with Gore: <P></P>"We certainly talked about the differences in attitude between Canada and the United States on the issue, that despite where the Conservative government is going, that Canadians and Quebecers are very concerned about climate change, climate disruption and we told him that we thought his message would be well received in Canada." <P></P>Adams, in his presentation, said that the environment was poised to become "a secular religion" in Canada in the years ahead and that a smart political movement would know how to harness the sentiment.<P></P>For the first time since the 1980s, Adams said, the environment has crept up to renewed prominence as one of the issues Canadians define as most urgent. <P></P>Though this is a non-partisan gathering, it is organized around the idea of reinvigorating political policy that stands in opposition to conservatism — and all that Harper appears to represent. <P></P>Justin Trudeau, son of the former prime minister, told attendees at the opening of the conference Tuesday night that their focus had to be on getting the left's act together so it can regain power. <P></P>"What are we going to do as progressives if we return to power? That's a big challenge and it's one that we need to think about it," Trudeau said.<P></P>He summed up the aim of this conference as a search for "what it takes to take over this country once again and make sure we are moving in the right direction." <P></P> But power is being discussed less than policy overall at this two-day event and panelists have been focused on big ideas for creating politics known as "progressive."<P></P> The panel discussions at yesterday's sessions revolved around lofty subjects such as urban integration, social cohesion among multicultural and immigrant groups, and the current debate over rebalancing fiscal relations between Ottawa, the provinces and cities.<P></P>The differences between Canada the U.S. provide a constant theme and may prove to be an organizing principle, especially as Harper faces more accusations that he is trying to move Canada closer to President George W. Bush's world view — on everything from foreign policy to media relations. <P></P>The conference winds up today with discussions on international relations, the Canada "brand" and promoting prosperity.
