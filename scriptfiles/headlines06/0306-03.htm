<p>WASHINGTON -- The Republican-led Congress and President Bush are facing growing anger on 
college campuses as students and their parents prepare to pay higher borrowing 
costs because of new changes to federal student loan programs.

        <!--/endimage/-->Congress narrowly passed a deficit-reduction bill last month that cut $12 
billion from student loan programs, which was signed by the president. The new 
law will slash subsidies to lenders and raise interest rates on loans taken out 
by parents. 
<P>Lawmakers already had approved a steep increase in interest rates for 
Stafford loans, used by nearly 10 million students each year. Both rate 
increases take effect July 1. 
<P>Jessica Pierce, a senior at UC Santa Cruz who has Stafford loans, said she 
was outraged by the changes approved by Congress. 
<P>"They're trying to balance the budget on the backs of students," said 
Pierce, who chairs the university's student union assembly. 
<P>The higher interest rates come as many students and parents are already 
struggling to cope with rising tuition costs. Department of Education figures 
suggest that at least 400,000 qualified students do not enroll in four-year 
colleges each year because of financial barriers. 
<P>The average debt of college graduates has jumped by 50 percent over the 
last decade, according to the Project on Student Debt, a nonprofit advocacy 
group. But for the last several years, low interest rates have helped students 
cushion the blow and reduce their monthly payments. 

<P>Education policy experts said the new cuts in subsidies to lenders and 
changes to interest rates will result in greater borrowing costs for many 
students and parents. 
<P>Students with Stafford loans, the most common type of federal loan, who 
have locked in variable rates as low as 4.7 percent this year will face higher 
monthly payments when those loans shift to a fixed rate of 6.8 percent in July. 

<P>The move to a fixed rate was first approved by Congress in 2002 with 
bipartisan support and the backing of many lenders and student groups, who 
believed the change would shield students from even higher variable rates. But 
now many students and parents oppose the change, fearing it will increase their 
monthly payments. 
<P>Mike Rau, whose 20-year-old daughter, Lisa, is a sophomore at San 
Francisco State University, is worried she will end up paying thousands of 
dollars more in interest on her Stafford loans. 
<P>"When she gets out of school and starts making payments, instead of it 
taking four years to pay off her loans it will take five or six years," said 
Rau, who is helping his daughter pay for college. "It saddles them with more 
debt for longer in their lives." 
<P>Lisa Rau, who is studying creative writing, communications and philosophy, 
is trying to save a portion of each paycheck from her 18-hour-a-week work-study 
job. But she is concerned that higher monthly interest payments will limit her 
options after college. 
<P>"It might have an impact on whether I go to grad school," she said. "If I 
don't have the money and I'm trying to pay off a lot of these loans and the 
interest rates are going up, that might be out of the question." 
<P>Financial aid experts said the move to a fixed interest rate will be 
painful for many borrowers in the short term, but could help students if 
variable rates continue to climb. As recently as the 2000-2001 academic year, 
the variable rate for Stafford loans exceeded 6.8 percent. 
<P>"The argument for fixed rates is that they are predictable for students 
and predictable for the government," said Sandy Baum, a senior policy analyst 
for the College Board and an economics professor at Skidmore College. But at a 
time when rates are still relatively low, "the idea that students are paying a 
higher rate than the market rate is a very unappealing one," she said. 
<P>As part of the new bill, Congress also increased the interest rate on 
loans paid by parents. Parent Loans for Undergraduate Students, better known as 
PLUS loans, had been scheduled to rise from the current rate of 6.1 percent to 
a fixed rate of 7.9 percent. 
<P>But lawmakers, seeking greater savings in the budget package, boosted the 
rate even higher, to 8.5 percent. The change is likely to make the loans less 
attractive to many parents. 
<P>"The question for parents is: Is it better to take out a PLUS loan or is 
it better to take out a home equity loan?" Baum said. "They need to look at all 
their options." 
<P>The changes will have broad consequences for colleges in the Bay Area. At 
UC Berkeley, 8,400 undergraduate students and 3,500 graduate students have 
borrowed money to pay for college using Stafford loans. Parents of 2,100 
undergraduates are receiving PLUS loans. 
<P>Cheryl Resh, UC Berkeley's director of financial aid, plans to e-mail 
students this spring with advice on how to cope with the changes. She is 
already urging students to consider consolidating their loans before July 1 to 
lock in a lower interest rate. 
<P>"I'm hoping that parents of students who are here right now are going to 
help their students take advantage of consolidating at a time when there are 
still some very good rates out there," Resh said.  
<P>Barbara Hubler, director of financial aid at San Francisco State 
University, said she and other college administrators were disappointed that 
Congress in recent years has not boosted funding for Pell Grants  --  which are 
awards, not loans  --  to help students struggling to pay for college. 
<P>"We know that across the (California State University system) more 
students are reaching the maximum on their federal direct loans and are having 
to take out more money from private lenders," Hubler said. "That is another 
drawback. Those are not subsidized by the government. ... It just means more 
money and another lender they will have to pay back when they get out of 
school." 

<P>Supporters of the new law said it contains some provisions to help 
students. Congress raised the Stafford loan limits to allow students to borrow 
more in their first two years in college, although the total they can borrow 
remains at $23,000. The measure also will phase out the 3 percent origination 
fees for Stafford loans, although some lenders already have been discounting 
the fees. 
<P>The bill was narrowly passed by Congress because of concerns over the $39 
billion in cuts to Medicaid, Medicare, student loans and other programs. In 
December, Vice President Dick Cheney cast a tie-breaking vote to pass it in the 
Senate. The House passed the bill Feb. 1 by just two votes. 
<P>The new law has been a political liability for Republicans in Congress and 
the White House. During a question-and- answer session at Kansas State 
University in January, Bush was asked by sophomore Tiffany Cooper why the 
government was cutting $12 billion from student loan programs.  
<P>"I was just wondering how is that supposed to help our futures?" she 
asked. 
<P>Bush responded: "Actually, I think what we did was reform the student loan 
program. We are not cutting money out of it." 
<P>The $12 billion will come largely from trimming the profits made by 
lenders on student loans and raising the rates on parent borrowers, according 
to the Congressional Budget Office. 
<P>Democrats said the money should have been used to lower interest rates and 
increase Pell Grants instead of being diverted to the federal Treasury. Student 
groups claimed the changes were mostly aimed at paying for $70 billion in tax 
cuts. 
<P>"Some people will describe it as paying down the deficit," said Luke 
Swarthout, a higher education associate for the Public Interest Research Group. 
"If you look at how the reconciliation process started, it becomes clear this 
is, in fact, a down payment on a series of tax cuts."
<b>Increasing costs of higher education </b>
<P>Starting July 1, the 
cost of student loans for students and their families is scheduled to rise 
because of changes approved by Congress and President Bush. Among them:
<ul>
<li>Students who have been paying variable interest rates of 4.7 percent 
(for in-school students) to 5.3 percent (for college graduates) for their 
federal Stafford loans will now pay a fixed rate of 6.8 percent. The change, 
first approved by Congress in 2002, will affect nearly 10 million students who 
receive Stafford loans each year. An average college student who graduates with 
$17,500 in student loans will pay an additional $1,600 in interest over 10 
years by switching from a 5.3 percent variable rate to a 6.8 percent fixed 
rate.</li>
<li>Interest rates for loans taken out by parents will jump from a 
variable rate of 6.1 percent to a fixed rate of 8.5 percent cent under the bill 
passed by Congress last month. About 800,000 parents each year take out the 
federal loan, called the PLUS loan. A parent who took out $10,000 in PLUS loans 
will pay an additional $1,500 over 10 years in interest by switching to an 8.5 
percent fixed rate.</li>
<li>Loan limits for freshmen will be raised from $2,625 to $3,500, and for 
sophomores from $3,500 to $4,500. But the total amount a student can borrow 
through the program will stay the same at $23,000.</li>
<li>Loan limits for professional and graduate students will be raised from 
$10,000 to $12,000. Graduate students will now be eligible for PLUS loans.</li>
<li>Student borrowers will no longer be able to consolidate their loans 
while they are in school, and they won't be able to consolidate their loans 
with their spouse's loans.</li>
<li>The 3 percent origination fee for loans will be phased out gradually 
by 2010. But a separate 1 percent loan guaranty fee will be included.</li>
<li>The Department of Education will offer two new grants: Academic 
Competitiveness grants of $750 for freshmen and $1,300 for sophomores, and 
SMART grants for juniors and seniors of $4,000. Applicants must be full-time 
students and eligible for Pell Grants.</li>
</ul>
<b>
Advice from financial aid experts </b>

<P>Here are some strategies 
financial aid experts suggest for holding down student loan costs when new 
interest rate increases start this summer:
<ul>
<li>Consider consolidating student loans before July 1, when the higher 
interest rates kick in. "Being able to consolidate and lock in a low interest 
rate is always a good thing for students to do," said Cheryl Resh, director of 
financial aid at UC Berkeley.</li>
<li>Parents should look into the option of a home equity loan  --  it may 
be cheaper than a PLUS loan when the rate goes up to 8.5 percent. "The interest 
on home equity loans is tax deductible," said Sandy Baum, a senior policy 
analyst for the College Board. "There are some people who can deduct interest 
on education loans, but not everyone."</li>
<li>Shop around among loan providers: Some lenders are waiving origination 
fees, others are not. The interest rates are set on federal loans, but the 
terms of the loan are often very different. And students should avoid taking on 
too much debt. "People have to be more cautious about their borrowing levels," 
Baum said. "You should never borrow the maximum amount you can afford. You 
should always give yourself some leeway."</li>
