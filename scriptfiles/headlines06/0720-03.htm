A federal Department of Homeland Security agent passed along information 
about student protests against military recruiters at UC Berkeley and UC Santa 
Cruz, landing the demonstrations on a database tracking foreign terrorism, 
according to government documents released Tuesday. 
<P>The documents were released by the American Civil Liberties Union, which 
filed a Freedom of Information Act request on behalf of student groups that 
protested against recruiters who visited their campuses in April 2005. 
<P>The students were angry when they turned up in the database of a Pentagon 
program called Threat and Local Observation Notice, or TALON, which the 
government started in 2003 as a way to collect data that could help stop 
terrorist attacks. Officials have acknowledged that the reports on protests 
should not have been included. 
<P>In the Santa Cruz and Berkeley reports, the source of information was 
listed as an agent for Homeland Security's Federal Protective Service. The 
reports were filed by the 902nd Military Intelligence Group, the Army's largest 
counterespionage unit. 
<P>"This raises questions about whether the Department of Homeland Security 
tasked somebody to gather information about anti-war activities," said Mark 
Schlosberg, police practices policy director for the ACLU's Northern California 
office. 
<P>Dennis O'Connor, a spokesman for the Federal Protective Service, said his 
agency protects 9,000 federal sites. Agents disseminate publicly available 
information about protests, he said, but do not investigate them or their 
organizers, spy on them or try to hinder them. He said he did not know how the 
information ended up in the terror database. 

<P>"If we're not aware of what's going on around us, we can't do our job 
effectively," he said. "Even if a protest is going to be peaceful, we have to 
be aware of it."  
<P>The reports say the FBI's Joint Terrorism Task Force in San Francisco had 
been briefed on the protests. FBI spokeswoman LaRae Quy said the agency had 
taken no action related to the protests. 
<P>The report on the Berkeley protest said the Homeland Security agent 
received an e-mail on April 18, 2005, announcing a "counter-recruitment" and 
civil disobedience action three days later, when recruiters would be at a 
career fair. In a section titled "Agent Notes," the report states, "There is a 
strong potential for a confrontation at this protest given the strong support 
for anti-war protests and movements in the past." 
<P>NBC News revealed the database in December. The Pentagon acknowledged that 
the protest reports should not have been included in the database, which now 
has more than 13,000 entries. 
<P>The reports "have been removed," Pentagon spokesman Greg Hicks said 
Tuesday. 
<P>Schlosberg said the ACLU is seeking further information. In the documents 
released Tuesday, the government blacked out the source of the e-mails to the 
Homeland Security agent.
