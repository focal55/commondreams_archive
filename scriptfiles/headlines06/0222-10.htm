<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->WASHINGTON</span><span class="dateline-separator"> - </span></b>The Dubai firm that won Bush administration backing to run six U.S. ports has at least two ties to the White House.</p>
<p>One is Treasury Secretary John Snow, whose department heads the federal panel that signed off on the $6.8 billion sale of an English company to government-owned Dubai Ports World - giving it control of Manhattan's cruise ship terminal and Newark's container port.</p>
<p>Snow was chairman of the CSX rail firm that sold its own international port operations to DP World for $1.15 billion in 2004, the year after Snow left for President Bush's cabinet.</p>

<p>The other connection is David Sanborn, who runs DP World's European and Latin American operations and who was tapped by Bush last month to head the U.S. Maritime Administration.</p>
<p>The ties raised more concerns about the decision to give port control to a company owned by a nation linked to the Sept. 11 hijackers.</p>
<p>"The more you look at this deal, the more the deal is called into question," said Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., who said the deal was rubber-stamped in advance - even before DP World formally agreed to buy London's P&O port company.</p>
<p>Besides operations in New York and Jersey, Dubai would also run port facilities in Philadelphia, New Orleans, Baltimore and Miami.</p>
<p>The political fallout over the deal only grows.</p>
<p>"It's particularly troubling that the United States would turn over its port security not only to a foreign company, but a state-owned one," said western New York's Rep. Tom Reynolds, chairman of the National Republican Campaign Committee. Reynolds is responsible for helping Republicans keep their majority in the House.</p>
<p>Snow's Treasury Department runs the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., which includes 11 other agencies.</p>
<p>"It always raises flags" when administration officials have ties to a firm, Rep. Vito Fossella, R-N.Y., said, but insisted that stopping the deal was more important.</p>

<p>The New York Daily News has learned that lawmakers also want to know if a detailed 45-day investigation should have been conducted instead of one that lasted no more than 25 days.</p>
<p>According to a 1993 congressional measure, the longer review is mandated when the company is owned by a foreign government and the purchase "could result in control of a person engaged in interstate commerce in the U.S. that could affect the national security of the U.S."</p>
<p>Congressional sources said the president has until March 2 to trigger that closer look.</p>
<p>"The most important thing is for someone to explain how this is consistent with our national security," Fossella said.</p>
