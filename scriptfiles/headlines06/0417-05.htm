<p> KABUL, Afghanistan - The United States  military on Sunday announced that it would investigate the deaths connected to two combat operations in Afghanistan in the past two days  against insurgents believed to be tied to the Taliban.</p>
<p>Seven civilians were reported killed in one battle. In the other battle,  civilians also were reported  killed or wounded, and four Afghan  police officers were reported by villagers to have been killed by United States fire. 
</p>
<p>The prompt decision to investigate the circumstances in both incidents  and to announce the step reflected a new openness by the  United States  military command about its operations in Afghanistan. But it  also revealed coordination problems among Afghan forces, the  American military and other foreign forces in Afghanistan as the  insurgency that is believed to be linked to the country's former Taliban rulers has found strength with the return of spring weather.</p>
<p> Coalition forces fought insurgents in  Kunar Province in the east on Saturday night, pounding a house and a cave where militants were holed up, using  air support, artillery and direct fire. "Several of the insurgents are believed to have been killed; the rest retreated," said a United States military  statement.  But in the aftermath, soldiers  found that civilians had been killed or wounded in  the fighting. Three wounded civilians were taken to an American  military base at Asadabad  for  treatment,  and the dead were being returned to their families, the statement said. </p>

<p> "Our hearts go out to the families of the innocent victims of this battle,"  Army Maj. Gen. Benjamin C. Freakley,  the operational commander of the United States-led  coalition force, said in the statement.  "I've directed an investigation to determine the facts in this matter." </p>
<p> The statement  accused  the rebels of  endangering civilians by fighting  close  to areas where they live.</p>
<p> In a separate statement, the United States military said it had  ordered an investigation of the killings of  four Afghan policemen on Friday  in joint operations against forces suspected  of being Taliban in Kandahar Province in the south.  Villagers reported that an American helicopter had fired on and killed the  policemen in  Sartak. Civilian casualties were also reported in the attack. </p>
<p> Without naming the place, the  military noted an incident in a battle in which  police  casualties occurred, "possibly caused by friendly forces."  It said,  "We will review all our procedures to ensure that we continue to coordinate with our Afghan partners against our common enemy."  </p>
