But instead of welcoming Mr. McCain, an Arizona Republican who is considered a possible presidential candidate, hundreds of students and faculty members are up in arms, calling the invitation a prime example of what they see as the disconnect between Mr. Kerrey, the onetime Democratic senator from Nebraska, and the institution he leads.</p>
<p>They say their school, with its long legacy of progressivism, should not be used to give Mr. McCain, who is lately stressing his conservative pedigree, any New York credibility as a moderate. </p>
<p>Yesterday, after delivering a petition with nearly 1,000 signatures urging Mr. Kerrey to rescind Mr. McCain's invitation, about three dozen students and professors rallied outside a New School building at Fifth Avenue and 14th Street.</p>

<p>They stood before a banner reading "Our Commencement Is Not Your Platform" and carried signs saying, "Pre-emptive War Is Not a New School Value." And in speeches, they variously had venom for Mr. McCain and Mr. Kerrey.</p>
<p> "Senator John McCain does not believe in a woman's right to control her own fertility," shouted Ann Snitow, a professor of literature and gender studies. "He has been opposed to Roe v. Wade for more than 20 years. He is a man who believes in female sexual slavery." Ms. Snitow added: "What would he have to do to not be invited? Would he have to say we should drop a nuclear bomb on Iran tomorrow?" </p>
<p>Brittany Charlton, the vice chairwoman of the University Student Senate, said Mr. Kerrey's choice of speaker had left many graduates with unpalatable choices of boycotting commencement or attending and protesting. </p>
<p>"It is extremely distasteful and hypocritical to allow McCain, someone who does not value the ideals we have consistently been taught in our education, to speak at the ceremony that represents the culmination of our experience with this university," she said. </p>
<p>Mark Salter, Mr. McCain's chief of staff, said of the protests, "I am sure it represents a small minority of students." He added, "The senator is looking forward to sharing this occasion," </p>
<p>Progressivism has long been at the heart of the New School's identity. It was founded in 1919 by a group of intellectuals, including John Dewey, the progressive historians Charles Beard and James Harvey Robinson and the economist Thorstein Veblen. </p>
<p>It now has some 9,300 students in eight schools. </p>
<p>Mr. Kerrey, who has been president since 2001, has had his share of difficulties in that role, facing protests when he admitted that he led a combat mission in Vietnam in which unarmed women and children were killed. He also debated his own students over invading Iraq. </p>

<p>He sounded thoroughly unruffled about this latest flap, suggesting that the student and faculty protesters did not get it — not the business of running a university, which he said requires inviting the best graduation speaker possible, and not the business of presidential politics. Mr. Kerrey, a former Nebraska governor, unsuccessfully sought the 1992 Democratic nomination and flirted briefly with running in 2000. </p>
<p>He said that he extended the invitation to Mr. McCain in January and that there had been nary a complaint until Mr. McCain came under criticism about his intentions to be the graduation speaker at Liberty University, headed by the Rev. Jerry Falwell. </p>
<p>Mr. McCain denounced Mr. Falwell and the religious broadcaster Pat Robertson as "agents of intolerance" in 2000, when he ran against George W. Bush for the Republican presidential nomination. This year, when asked about his appearance at Liberty, he compared it to his planned appearance at the New School.</p>
<p> "It didn't become a controversy until he agreed to go to Liberty," Mr. Kerrey said, adding, "I am perfectly comfortable having him come. I am comfortable with the students protesting. I am not going to withdraw the invitation." </p>

<p>Mr. Kerrey disputed assertions by protesters that Mr. McCain only chose to speak at the New School graduation, which will be held on May 19 at the Theater at Madison Square Garden, to offset his appearance at Liberty, in Virginia. "It's the other way around," he said. </p>
<p>He also said there was no political gain for Mr. McCain in coming to the New School. </p>
<p>"That's where I think the students are missing it," he said. "The fact is, to win a Republican primary, coming here is a negative, not an asset." Mr. McCain has also generated some protest at Columbia University, where he will give the keynote address on Class Day, next Tuesday.  School officials invited Mr. McCain, whose daughter is a junior at Columbia, to speak after former President Bill Clinton and Senator Barack Obama of Illinois declined invitations from the senior class. </p>
<p>The demonstrators at the New School stressed that they were not seeking to silence Mr. McCain. Rather, they said, they objected to him speaking at commencement. </p>
<p> "I would love him to come and give a talk where he could be questioned," said Alan McGowan, a science professor. "But graduation is the wrong place." </p>
<p>Carolyn Thompson, a graduating urban studies major, said she had no intention of attending graduation until she heard that Mr. McCain was the speaker. Now, she is going — to protest. </p>

<p>Ms. Thompson, 22, said she believed Mr. Kerrey and Mr. McCain were serving each other's interests by making both the school and the future candidate seem more moderate. </p>
<p>"I understand that they are two Vietnam vets, and they are buddy-buddy with each other, they are politicians, but at the same time, the implications for this university and for the presidential election in 2008 are frightening for me as a young woman." </p>
<p>Mr. Kerrey said graduating seniors might learn something from Mr. McCain about character. </p>
<p>He recalled the bitter opposition that he and Mr. McCain faced from fellow veterans during their work to normalize American relations with Vietnam. "My guess is Senator McCain is going to talk a lot about character and part of character is willing to stand before protest," Mr. Kerrey said. "I have been with John when both of us were spat upon for advocating normalizing relations with Vietnam, called him a traitor. I hope they don't disrupt the commencement of other classmates and family members who will be there."</p>
