        The global diamond trade is continuing to fund vicious civil wars in countries such as Ivory Coast and Liberia, despite international efforts to blacklist stones from regions at war. 
<p>
  Human rights campaigners warn, in the approach to Valentine's Day, that an 
  international system of regulating the gem trade is being systematically 
  bypassed. Millions of men, women and children are being killed, injured and 
  made homeless as a result. According to a <a href="http://www.globalwitness.org">Global Witness</a> and <a href="http://www.amnesty.org">Amnesty 
  International</a> report released today, "conflict diamonds" from 
  Liberia are being smuggled into neighbouring countries for export, and 
  stones from strife-torn Ivory Coast are also finding their way on to the 
  British and other European markets.

     In Liberia, a bitter eight-year civil war, which has killed more than 
  200,000 people and displaced more than a million, has been fuelled by the 
  illegal diamond trade. Diamonds from Ivory Coast are smuggled to Mali and 
  sold on the international market to provide millions of dollars in revenue 
  for rebel factions such as the Forces Nouvelles.
</p>
<p>
  Amnesty International and Global Witness are calling on the public to 
  protest against the international trade in conflict diamonds. Shoppers are 
  being urged to ask sales staff at jewellers where their diamonds come from 
  and whether the areas are conflict-free.

</p>
<p>
  Under existing guidelines retailers should be able to provide a copy of 
  their company policy on conflict diamonds and a written guarantee from 
  suppliers about the origin of the stones.
</p>
<p>
   "Despite some progress, we are still concerned that the UK diamond 
  industry is falling short in combating the trade in conflict diamonds," 
  said Tom Fyans, Amnesty International UK economic relations manager, who 
  claimed that a recent survey revealed only 18 per cent of stores could 
  provide any assurance.
</p>
<p>
  Since 2003, following a big international campaign highlighting the 
  consequences of the trade in conflict diamonds, an international 
  certification scheme called the Kimberley Process has been in place, which 
  means a certificate, guaranteeing diamonds as conflict-free, should 
  accompany all shipments of rough diamonds to and from participating 
  countries.
</p>
<p>
  In addition all sectors of the diamond industry, including high-street 
  retailers, agreed to a voluntary system of warranties to ensure diamonds 
  continue to be tracked right up to the point of sale. "All the diamond 
  producing countries, the traders and the retailers voluntarily agreed to 
  provide guarantees to the point of sale so that consumers can walk into a 
  high street shop and be sure they are getting a good, clean diamond," 
  said Sarah Green, spokeswoman for Amnesty International, yesterday. " 
  Unfortunately what was agreed has not been followed through. We know that a 
  lot of conflict diamonds are creeping into the system and many retailers are 
  not bothering to make warranties available.
</p>

<p>
   "When we carried out a street-level survey only 18 per cent of stores 
  could provide a copy of their conflict diamond policy and 22 per cent 
  admitted they had no policy at all."
</p>
<p>
  In the past warlords and rebel groups in countries including Angola, the 
  Democratic Republic of Congo, Liberia and Sierra Leone have used billions of 
  dollars of profits from the sale of diamonds from the mines they control to 
  buy arms and fund devastating wars.
</p>
<p>
  According to Amnesty International and the campaign group Global Witness, 
  rough diamonds mined in rebel-held areas of Ivory Coast and Liberia are 
  still being traded.
</p>
<p>
  The illegal stones are smuggled out of conflict areas and into neighbouring 
  countries where they are either sold on the black market or mixed in with 
  legitimate Kimberley-certified diamonds and passed off as being sourced from 
  elsewhere.
</p>
<p>

   "Diamonds have provided funding for several brutal conflicts in 
  Africa, resulting in the death and displacement of millions of people," 
  says a report compiled by Global Witness into the continuing illegal trade. 
  Four months ago a Global Witness investigation into the trade discovered 
  that diamonds were being smuggled out of Ivory Coast by rebel agents to Mali 
  and Guinea where they were sold to international traders.
</p>
<p>
  Hundreds of labourers are being forced to work in diamond pits in three 
  villages - Seguela, Bobi and Diarabala - in the north of the country to 
  extract up to 300,000 carats a year worth more than $25m (&pound;14m).
</p>
<p>
  In addition Global Witness claims that international terrorist groups 
  including al-Qa'ida have infiltrated diamond trading networks to raise funds 
  for their cause and launder huge amounts of money.
</p>
<p>
  Among the areas targeted by al-Qa'ida is believed to be the illegal 
  operations in Liberia, which was used as a conduit for diamonds mined by the 
  rebel group the RUF during the war in Sierra Leone which was responsible for 
  the deaths of at least 50,000 people and the mutilation, rape, torture and 
  abduction of thousands of others. So far more than 200,000 lives have been 
  lost in Liberia as a result of the conflict there.
</p>
<p>

   "Things have got a lot better since the Kimberley Process was set up 
  in 2003 but there is still a lot that can be done," said Susie Sanders 
  of Global Witness, who said that at one time it was estimated that one in 
  six diamonds was a conflict diamond but now, with the stricter controls in 
  place, that percentage is now very small.
</p>
<p>
   "We want people to help put pressure on the retailers who, in turn, 
  will put pressure on their suppliers to end once and for all the trade in 
  conflict diamonds," said Ms Sanders.
</p>
<p>
   "Diamonds may be expensive, but they shouldn't cost lives."
</p>

   <b>Ask before you buy</b>
<p>

   <i>Every consumer can help ensure diamonds never again fund conflict by 
  asking four simple questions. Before buying a diamond, shoppers should ask 
  the sales person the following:</i>
</p>
<p>
   <b>1.</b> How can I be sure that none of your jewellery contains conflict 
  diamonds?
</p>
<p>
   <b>2.</b> Do you know where the diamonds you sell come from?
</p>
<p>

   <b>3.</b> Can I see a copy of your company's policy on conflict diamonds?
</p>
<p>
   <b>4.</b> Can you show me a written guarantee from your diamond suppliers 
  stating that your diamonds are conflict-free?
</p>
<p>
   <i>"They should be only too pleased to help you," says a campaign 
  guide from Amnesty International and Global Witness. "If they aren't, 
  try somewhere else, and tell them why."</i>
