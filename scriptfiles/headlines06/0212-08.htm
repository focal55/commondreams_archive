<p>A US newsmagazine published a photo of President George W. Bush with disgraced lobbyist Jack Abramoff, but said the White House continued to assert Bush did not recall having met him.</p>

Time's online edition, at <a href="http://www.time.com" target="_new">www.time.com</a>, said it was the first published photo showing Bush with Abramoff, at a meeting in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building adjacent to the White House on May 9, 2001.</p>
<p>

The publication of the photo came amid a mushrooming scandal of influence-peddling in Washington, and threatened to raise fresh questions about Abramoff's link to the Republican administration.</p>
<p>

The once-powerful lobbyist on January 3 pleaded guilty to conspiracy, fraud, and tax evasion linked to his Washington lobbying activities.</p>
<p>

The photo shows Abramoff in the background as Bush greets one of Abramoff's clients, Time said.</p>
<p>

The magazine in January revealed the existence of photos showing the president with Abramoff, but did not publish them.</p>
<p>

&quot;We were only allowed to view the photos before. As soon as we could publish, we did,&quot; Time spokesman Ty Trippet told AFP.</p>
<p>

In its online edition Saturday, Time reported: &quot;The White House, however, has continued to assert that the president had no recollection of ever meeting Abramoff.&quot;</p>

<p>

Shown the photograph, White House spokesman Scott McClellan said the White House had &quot;found no record of Abramoff's presence but confirmed that it is Abramoff in the picture,&quot; Time said.</p>
<p>

Asked to comment on the report, a White House spokeswoman told AFP: &quot;The photo is not relevant to the Justice Department investigation&quot; of Abramoff.</p>
<p>

&quot;The president dropped by a meeting of some two dozen state legislators in 2001 to thank them for passing resolutions supporting tax relief, as we have previously pointed out,&quot; spokeswoman Maria Tamburri said. &quot;We now know that Mr. Abramoff attended the meeting.</p>

<p>

&quot;The president has taken countless tens of thousands of pictures. It does not mean he has a personal relationship with those in the pictures.&quot;</p>
<p>

Abramoff, a major fund-raiser for Bush's re-election campaign, has entered a plea deal with the government and agreed to cooperate in ongoing investigations of lawmakers who may be implicated in his web of influence-peddling.</p>
