An informal International Women's Tribunal, meeting at the sixth World Social Forum in the Venezuelan capital, found "imperialism" and U.S. President George W. Bush guilty of violating the human rights of people in countries like Iraq and Cuba. 
 Another panel made up of 10 religious leaders, human rights lawyers and 
activists held a trial and condemned "state terrorism" <br>
committed by 
Washington in Iraq.

Meanwhile, the Parliamentary Forum, which brought together the legislators 
taking part in the annual WSF global civil society gathering, roundly 
criticised a U.S. bill that would tighten immigration laws.
<br>
Host President Hugo Chávez, addressing some 15,000 WSF participants, called 
the Bush administration "the most perverse, murderous, genocidal and immoral 
empire" in history.
<br><br>
The Venezuelan leader said Bush, who he calls "Mr. Danger", in reference to 
a character in a Venezuelan novel, is "the world's biggest terrorist".
<br><br>
"Mr. Danger talks about human rights, but there are people in Guantanamo 
(Cuba) who are tortured, and people who disappear in the CIA jails in Europe 
and elsewhere in the world," Chávez told a cheering crowd.
<br><br>
In every street demonstration held at the Jan. 24-29 WSF in Caracas, signs 
can be seen proclaiming "No to Bush!" or "Get Out Bush!", while the 
protesters frequently chant anti-Bush slogans.
<br><br>
The International Women's Tribunal heard testimony from Irma González, the 
daughter of one of the "Cuban Five" - the five Cuban men in prison in the 
United States on espionage charges - and from Ramia Masi, an activist with 
the Organisation of Women's Freedom in Iraq.
<br><br>
González said her father had spent seven years in prison without being able 
to receive visits, "because among other things, it has gotten more and more 
complicated to obtain a visa to the United States, which is a routine human 
rights violation."

<br><br>
For her part, the Iraqi activist presented a documentary that contains 
personal accounts and testimony on atrocities committed in the U.S.-led war 
and occupation of Iraq.
<br><br>
"Fundamentalism is a new thing in Iraq," said Masi. "The occupation drew out 
the greatest enemy of my country, the fundamentalists, who have destroyed 
our identity." She called for the construction of a secular alternative, in 
which women can be free.
<br><br>
Among those sitting on the panel that tried and condemned state terrorism 
were Reverend Lucius Walker, the leader of the U.S. organisation Pastors for 
Peace, Mexican activists Héctor Díaz and Guillermo López, and Reverend Raúl 
Suárez, a peace activist from Cuba.
<br><br>
The witnesses testifying against the Bush administration included Fernando 
Suárez, a Mexican-American whose son was killed in Iraq; Javier Couso from 
Spain, whose brother José, a journalist, was killed when a U.S. tank fired a 
shell at the Palestine Hotel in Baghdad, which was being used as a base by 
many independent reporters; and Colombian parliamentary candidate Lilia 
Solano.
<br><br>
Couso recalled that 90 journalists have lost their lives during the war in 
Iraq, while Suárez stressed that his son died as a victim of a cluster bomb, 
which "the United States is using on a daily basis in Iraq and which not 
only claim the lives of Iraqi civilians, but also the lives of their own 
soldiers. Bush is the number one terrorist," he declared.
<br><br>
Solano spoke out about Plan Colombia and its recently launched second stage, 
Plan Patriot - counterinsurgent and anti-drug initiatives that she described 
as "state terrorism financed by Washington."
<br><br>
The panel concluded by "firmly condemning" imperialism and the Bush 
administration.
<br><br>
In the meantime, a delegation of lawmakers from Mexico earned the backing of 
legislators from throughout the region in their opposition to a bill 
currently before the U.S. Congress aimed at extending the fences already 
blocking portions of the U.S.-Mexican border, among other measures.
<br><br>

Rafael Quintanar, a legislator from the centre-left Democratic Revolutionary 
Party (PRD) in the Mexican state of Quintano Roo, told IPS: "We want to 
condemn the wall of death that the United States is erecting on the border, 
and the new immigration law," which could come to a vote next month, and 
would penalise both undocumented immigrants and their eventual employers.
<br><br>
Another PRD representative, Emiliano Ramos, said that the party is 
collecting declarations of support and solidarity for Mexico from two dozen 
Latin American lawmakers, which it plans to send to the International Court 
of Justice in The Hague.
<br><br>
Another initiative being discussed at the WSF, Ramos added, is the 
organisation of a march from Central America to a point on the Mexican 
border with the United States, where a forum on migration is to be held in 
March.
<br><br>
The fence that the United States wants to throw up along the border "is the 
wall of indignity, death, racism, impunity and legalised crime," he 
maintained.
<br><br>
In his speech, Chávez called on WSF participants to condemn the U.S. 
government, "but not the people of the United States, whose participation is 
essential to save the planet."
<br><br>
As for "U.S. imperialism," he pronounced that "we will surely bury it this 
century."
