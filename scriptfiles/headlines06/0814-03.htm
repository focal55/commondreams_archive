<p>More than 20,000 delegates packed the 16th International AIDS conference, encouraged by the success of therapies that at last are reaching Africa but with optimism tempered by warnings that the end of AIDS remains over the horizon.</p>
<p>The six-day biennial mix of science, knowledge-sharing and grassroots activism, spiced with political bile and heart-searing testimony, debuted with a ceremony scanning the disease's murderous first quarter-century.</p>
<p>"Don't let there be a 50th anniversary of AIDS," the delegates, gathered in a darkened baseball stadium, were told, in a dreamy mock advertisement set in 2031, in which cancer was a distant memory, Palestinians and Israelis lived happily side-by-side and cars ran on water.</p>
<p>Gates, fresh from a new 500-million-dollar pledge to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, placed his faith for eradicating the disease in the hands of women -- and the potential of new microbicides and oral prevention drugs.</p>
<p>"We need tools that allow women to protect themselves," Gates said, in a keynote speech also delivered by his wife and co-philanthropist Melinda, after they were welcomed with a standing ovation.</p>
<p>"No matter where she lives, or what she does -- a woman should never need her partner's permission to save her own life," Gates said.</p>
<p>Microbicides are a gel which would kill or block the AIDS virus in the vagina or anus. Researchers hope that the first successful cream could be available as soon as 2009.</p>

<p>"This could mark a turning point in the epidemic ... if we can discover these new preventative tools and deliver them quickly to the highest-risk populations, we could revolutionise the fight against AIDS."</p>
<p>But leaders in the fight against AIDS warned that signs of hope should not disguise the desperate battle ahead.</p>
<p>"Tragically, the end of AIDS is nowhere in sight," said Peter Piot, executive director of UNAIDS.</p>
<p>Another general in the anti-AIDS fight vented some of the political fury that has underpinned the 25-year struggle against AIDS, accusing Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper of snubbing the event.</p>
<p>"Mr Harper, the role of prime minister includes the responsibility to show leadership on the world stage," conference co-chair Mark Wainberg said to rousing cheers.</p>
<p>Underlying the human toll wreaked by AIDS, one Rwandan grandmother told AFP of her labor of love to bring up grandchildren, with her own offspring too sick to care for them.</p>
<p>Laurance Mukamurangwa, 48, nurtures five grandchildren aged three months to five years, despite being afflicted herself by HIV after she was raped. </p>
<p>"It's really a problem for us because we don't have anything and must get food, clothes and school supplies and you must remember that I am sick too and I will die," Mukamurangwa said on the sidelines of the conference.</p>
<p>Researchers thronged seminars ranging from the treatment of AIDS in war zones to hopes for a new generation of preventative treatments.</p>

<p>US doctors who took part in a massive scaleup of antiretroviral drugs in the Zambian capital of Lusaka reported how treatments were distributed to 16,000 patients, thanks in large part to US President George W. Bush's AIDS programme.</p>
<p>The drugs failed to save patients whose immune systems had been virtually wrecked by AIDS, but by the 18-month mark "the vast majority" of patients had been saved.</p>
<p>The conference is likely to reverberate with demands for governments to honour multi-billion-dollar pledges to combat the pandemic.</p>
<p>VIP highlights include former US president Bill Clinton and Hollywood heart-throb Richard Gere -- who also took a shot at Harper on Sunday, comparing him to former US president Ronald Reagan, who recanted his early reluctance to fight AIDS while he was in office.</p>
<p>The conference theme of "Time to Deliver" was to be driven home in an opening concert from soulster Alicia Keys and Canadian rockers Barenaked Ladies.</p>
<p>But despite the celebrity glitz, leaders in the struggle against AIDS warned that gains against the virus could evaporate without constant vigilance.</p>
<p>"The AIDS epidemic now matches the bubonic plague. Twenty-five million people have died," noted Catherine DeAngelis, editor-in-chief of the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA).</p>
<p>At the end of last year, 38.6 million people were living with HIV which wrecks the body's immune system and makes it vulnerable to opportunistic disease, UNAIDS reported in May.</p>
