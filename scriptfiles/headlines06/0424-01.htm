<p>Democratic Sen. Joe Lieberman, who once occupied the lofty No. 2 spot on his party's presidential ticket, is too Republican for some Democrats.

The three-term lawmaker, a strong advocate of the Iraq War, proponent of some GOP policies and recipient of a kiss from President Bush, has frustrated several national Democrats and angered enough in his home state to draw a primary challenger.</p>
<p>"I think it's a challenge for Lieberman to reconnect to the rank-and-file of the party and prove he is an authentic Democrat," said John McNamara, chairman of the New Britain Democratic Town Committee.</p>
<p>Bumper stickers spotted in Connecticut read, "Anybody but Joe &#151; I want a real Democrat in '06." Campaign buttons show Bush and Lieberman in an embrace, with the words, "The Kiss: Too Close for Comfort."</p>
<p>In February 2005, after Bush's State of the Union speech, the president hugged Lieberman and planted a kiss on his right cheek.</p>
<p>Call it the buss that launched a challenge.</p>
<p>Ned Lamont, a wealthy Greenwich businessman, is trying to snatch the Democratic nomination from Lieberman, arguing that the 64-year-old senator is "Republican-lite."</p>
<p>"One thing I hear wherever I go, to all audiences, is, 'Come on Democrats, be a constructive alternative, speak loudly and proudly for what you believe, no more mumbling.'" Lamont said.</p>

<p>While Lamont's arguments have struck a chord with many Democrats, Lieberman holds a considerable advantage in money, name recognition and party backing. Illinois Sen. Barack Obama recently traveled to Connecticut to offer a vocal defense of his colleague.</p>
<p>On Thursday, Lieberman launched his first television ads in a decade, addressing the war debate head on.</p>
<p>"I already know that some of you feel passionately against my position in Iraq. I respect your views, and while we probably won't change each others' minds, I hope we can still have a dialogue and find common ground on all the issues where we do agree," Lieberman says in the ad.</p>
<p>Still, the Democratic discontent remains loud.</p>
<p>Edward Anderson is a blogger who helped a friend set up the Web site, http://www.DumpJoe.com., in December 2004, angered by Lieberman's continued support of the Iraq war.</p>
<p>"In Joe's hometown, I can't find a Joe booster. If they are, they're a Republican," said Anderson, who lives in New Haven.</p>
<p>"I think that there's a significant number of Democrats who are disappointed in the senator's stand on the war," said John Stafstrom, a Lieberman supporter and chairman of the Bridgeport Democratic Town Committee. "He has always had some problems with the more liberal wing of the party anyway. This is a perfect excuse for people to show their displeasure with him."</p>
<p>On May 20, some 1,607 Democratic delegates will gather at the state convention. The majority winner is the party-endorsed candidate, but if Lamont garners 15 percent of the vote, he can force a primary. Even if he doesn't succeed, he can petition his way onto the primary ballot on Aug. 8.</p>
<p>McNamara estimates that more than half of New Britain's 31 delegates are leaning toward backing Lamont.</p>

<p>Lieberman has surprised several Democrats with personal calls asking for their support at the convention. He also raised the prospect of running as an independent, a prospect that could boost the Republicans if he and Lamont split the Democratic vote.
<p>
Lieberman was first elected to the Senate in 1988, ousting longtime Republican Sen. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. On foreign and defense policies, he has been a moderate, often aligning himself with the Republicans. But on issues such as abortion rights, gay rights and civil rights, he remains a liberal Democrat.
<p>
In 2000, Al Gore picked Lieberman to be his vice presidential running mate. Four years later, with Gore out of the picture, Lieberman made an unsuccessful bid for the Democratic presidential nomination.
<p>
Lieberman traditionally has been one of the highest vote-getters in Connecticut elections, capturing 63 percent of the vote in 2000 while running both for the vice presidency and the Senate.
<p>
Brent Dreher, 24, a student at Southern Connecticut State University who recently attended a Lamont speech, said a senator with Lieberman's national stature and experience should not be penalized because of his stance on the war.
<p>
"He's been in there long enough," Dreher said. "I don't see any reason to just automatically vote him out because of that one thing."
<p>
Ellen Camhi, the Democratic town committee chairwoman in Stamford, said many Democrats are supporting Lieberman.
<p>
"He's been there for us. He's been a good senator. While they may disagree with him on a couple of issues, they still support the man, his integrity and what he's done as a senator," Camhi said.
<p>
A Quinnipiac University poll, taken in March when Lamont announced his candidacy, showed Lieberman with support from 68 percent of registered Democrats to Lamont's 13 percent.

<p>
"It's still hard to imagine Lieberman being upset by Lamont. It's going to take a Herculean task I think," said poll director Douglas Schwartz.
<p>
Lieberman has raised $4.7 million for his re-election. Lamont, who founded a telecommunications company, raised more than $700,000 during the first three months of the year, more than half of it from his personal wealth.
<p>
Lieberman has likened the challenge to an "old-fashioned kitchen table debate within the Democratic family." His campaign spokesman, Sean Smith, dismissed the senator's detractors, arguing that many are party activists.
<p>
"The people who are engaged in this race right now are a certain type of voter," Smith said. "Most of the people who vote on Aug. 8 are living their lives right now and are not paying attention to this race."
