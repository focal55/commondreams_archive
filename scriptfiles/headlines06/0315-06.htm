members of a student anti-war organization at UC Santa Cruz  --  and made them 
a national face of the peace movement. 
<P>"We're not paranoid about it, and in a way, it's given us an opportunity 
to talk about the war to different people, to tell people that it was not OK to 
invade Iraq," said Kai Sawyer, 23, a member of Students Against War and a 
teaching assistant in the psychology department. "Berkeley may have the 
reputation for having a lot of anti-war activists, but I feel like Santa Cruz 
has had a lot more going on."

Students Against War brought the attention of both the left and the 
Pentagon to the hilly, redwood-studded campus through counter-recruiting  --  a 
tactic of directly taking on military recruiting that has become the leading 
edge of the anti-war movement.  
<P>Marches are still a staple of the movement, and there will be an 11 a.m. 
rally Saturday in San Francisco's Civic Center and others elsewhere nationally 
to mark the third anniversary of the U.S. invasion of Iraq. Members of Students 
Against War will be at the San Francisco rally wearing T-shirts reading, 
"Credible Threat"  --  a parody of Pentagon spymasters' assessment of the 
group's activities.  
<P>But counter-recruiting is where the anti-war movement's energies are 
going. 
<P>Counter-recruiting can take the form of demanding that a high school ask 
parents' permission before letting military recruiters contact their children. 
Or it can be a "queer kiss-in" in front of military recruiters, something UC 
Santa Cruz activists did at a campus job fair  in October to protest the 
military's ban on openly gay service members. 

<P>"Talking about a war on the other side of the world can get kind of 
abstract for some students," said Kristin Anderson, a San Francisco State 
University senior and board member of the nationwide Campus Anti-War Network. 
The Santa Cruz anti-war group is the network's largest on the West Coast. 
<P>"(Counter-recruitment) has gotten popular because it gives students 
something concrete they can do," Anderson said. "They see a recruiter trying to 
get their friend to join, and there's a chance that their friend might not come 
back. And if he does, he definitely won't be the same." 
<P>It was an April 5 counter-recruiting demonstration at Santa Cruz that led 
to Students Against War's national notoriety. 
<P>About a dozen protesters entered a career fair in a campus building and 
surrounded a table where military recruiters sat, preventing other students 
from talking with them. More than 300 people demonstrated outside. In the 
jostling that ensued, a career-center staffer was slightly injured. 
<P>The recruiters left; some found their tires slashed when they returned to 
their cars. No one has been cited in connection with the vandalism. 
<P>In December, MSNBC reported that the incident and a separate protest by a 
UC Berkeley group had turned up on a Defense Department database of potential 
threats against U.S. military facilities and personnel. The Santa Cruz incident 
was listed as a credible threat, while the Berkeley one was not. 
<P>Since the story broke, the American Civil Liberties Union, California's 
two U.S. senators and UC Santa Cruz's chancellor have demanded that the 
Pentagon explain how the students landed on the list and what the military is 
doing with the information. 
<P>The Pentagon has offered few answers. Earlier this month, the ACLU filed a 
federal lawsuit against the Defense Department, hoping to force the Pentagon to 
release any information it has gathered on the Santa Cruz and Berkeley groups.  
<P>Military recruiters are planning to return to the next campus job fair 
April 11, and again will be greeted by student activists. Students Against War 
has scheduled a demonstration for today asking UC Santa Cruz administrators to 
join the ACLU suit, something campus officials say they don't plan to do. 
<P>Last week, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that law schools can be stripped 
of federal funding if they deny full access to military recruiters. On Tuesday, 
the House backed that up with a resolution requiring institutions of higher 
education to provide military recruiters with as much access to students as 
other employers get, or risk losing federal dollars.  
<P>"The administration there is in a tough position," said Rep. Sam Farr, 
D-Carmel, whose district includes the Santa Cruz campus. He opposed the 
resolution, saying schools should be able to decide the recruiting question for 
themselves. "(Administrators) may feel that they have to be careful of opposing 
the military because there are a lot of federal research contracts there." 
<P>Liberal students have been drawn to UC Santa Cruz since the campus opened 
40 years ago. Their activism isn't limited to the military  --  largely at the 
urging of students, nearly one-fifth of the food served in university living 
quarters is organic and locally grown. 
<P>"Just seeing how many students were activists here, how everybody seems to 
be into something, makes you want to get involved," said Jessenia Meza, a 
19-year-old sophomore from Los Angeles who works with the Latino activist group 
MEChA.  
<P>This generation of UC Santa Cruz activists sees "the connections between a 
range of issues," said Steve Gliessman, a professor of agroecology who has been 
on campus 25 years. "They see how the war impacts everything from global trade 
to corporate control of resources." 
<P>That said, the most recent planning meeting of Students Against War seemed 
hardly the stuff of a terrorist cell. Not unless al Qaeda begins each meeting 
by asking each attendee the ice-breaker, "What is your favorite dance song or 
dance move?" 
<P>Jammed into a small on-campus conference room, 60 members plotted strategy 
while passing around bags of Dum-Dum Lollipops and day-old bagels. They planned 
wonky social outings like a house party to watch the 1992 documentary 
"Manufacturing Consent: Noam Chomsky and the Media," about the dissident 
linguist and liberal icon. 
<P>Decorum demands that even the tiniest group decisions be punctuated with 
the question, "Are people comfortable with that?" Leadership is rotated weekly, 
and all decisions are reached by consensus, which explains why Students Against 
War spent 35 minutes trying to decide whether to send a press release outlining 
their latest demands before or after today's demonstration. 

<P>Members like to point to the group's diversity. Though anti-war groups 
tend to be largely white, roughly a third of the members at last week's meeting 
were people of color. About half were women, and several were gay. 
<P>"Having that diversity of experience allows us to attack the same monster 
from a variety of angles," said Sam Aranke, a 20-year-old junior from Orange 
County. "So even if some people aren't comfortable with petitioning the 
government (through the ACLU lawsuit), they support it. Same goes for people 
who aren't comfortable demonstrating. 
<P>"So when we go to San Francisco Saturday for the march, we can't all just 
march around in a circle and have that be the end," Aranke said. "We all have 
to go back to our communities and do something about it."
