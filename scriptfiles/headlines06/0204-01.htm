<p> CARACAS, Venezuela - The tension between civil society organizations and 
the leftist and center-left governments in power in a number of South 
American nations, which often depart from their common objectives, became 
evident at the portion of the 6th World Social Form held in the Venezuelan 
capital.
<p>
						  "It is easier to confront conservative governments than to support 
progressive ones," admitted Lori Wallach, an activist with the U.S. 
organisation <a href="http://www.citizen.org" target="_new">Public Citizen</a>. "That is the challenge now."
<p>
Rejection of free trade agreements with the industrialized North and 
transgenic crops, as well as the need for stepped-up efforts to achieve 
gender equality and universal access to education and heath care, were once 
again key issues discussed at the WSF, which this year is taking part in 
three phases: Jan. 19-23 in Bamako, Mali; Jan. 24-29 in Caracas; and in late 
March in Karachi, Pakistan.
<p>
The failure of neoliberal, free-market policies to come up with solutions to 
the problems facing the poor majorities in Latin America and the Caribbean, 
and in developing countries at large, was once again underscored by the 
social and grassroots organizations that met last week in Caracas.
<p>
The participating civil society organizations continued to build a platform 
for future action, starting with indigenous people, who are planning their 
third continent-wide conference for October in Guatemala.
<p>
In that meeting, "we will reconfirm our rejection of free trade treaties 
(with the United States and the European Union) in defense of our 
territories and our water," indigenous organizations stated in a declaration 
that also underlines the objectives of "food security for our countries, and 
comprehensive land reform."
<p>

"We are in favor of the recovery and defense of native seeds, and 
categorically reject the sale and use of seeds produced with 'terminator' 
technology (which produces sterile seeds), because it is immoral and 
undermines food security for humanity, while denying seeds to 1.4 billion 
small farmers around the world," said the indigenous groups.
<p>
<a href="http://viacampesina.org/en/index.php" target="_new">Vía Campesina</a>, a global movement, and the Confederation of Latin American 
Rural Organizations also called for "global uprisings" against these 
policies on Apr. 17, International Day of Peasant Struggles, and Oct. 16, 
World Food Sovereignty Day.
<p>
On the gender equality front, participating organizations called for efforts 
to fight "the marketing and exploitation of women, and sexist, racist and 
homophobic violence in all of its expressions," and to promote the 
South-South LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender) dialogue.
<p>
Because of the dramatic health situation in sub-Saharan Africa, the region 
that is most heavily affected by HIV and AIDS, the Forum also agreed to make 
the right to health care one of the central themes of the 7th WSF to be held 
next year in Nairobi, Kenya.
<p>
For its part, Bogota will play host to a humanitarian camp aimed at 
promoting the universal right to health, from Apr. 4 to 7. Numerous 
organizations also agreed to establish an international peoples tribunal for 
the right to health during the same dates, in which they will emphasize that 
the inequalities provoked by neoliberal policies have given rise to a 
veritable genocide.
<p>
Meanwhile, the 4th World Education Forum, held during the 6th WSF itself, 
called for the defense of free, public, secular, mandatory and quality 
education that promotes a culture of peace.
<p>
The participants in this parallel forum noted that Latin America is 
witnessing the emergence of governments that have different characteristics 
but are similar in their attempt to break away from subordination to the 
neoliberal policies introduced in the 1990s.
<p>
The third week of November, or International Education Week, will be used as 
a framework to fight for new laws and policies in this sector.
<p>
Among the specific goals to be promoted are the guidelines set by the United 
Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO), which 
calls for governments to devote at least six percent of gross domestic 
product (GDP) to education, as well as initiatives to swap foreign debt for 
investment in education and programs geared to recognizing and valuing 
diversity in the educational sphere.

<p>
The fact that the 6th Forum was held in Venezuela, a country with a 
left-leaning government whose president says his goal is "21st century 
socialism", served to heighten the debate on whether this yearly gathering 
should be maintained as a space for meeting, reflection and exchange, or 
whether it is time to move on to establishing mechanisms for concrete 
action. This is a debate that will continue throughout future editions of 
the WSF.
<p>
Likewise, due to the leading role played by Venezuela in regional 
integration efforts, many of the discussions at the 6th WSF placed 
particular emphasis on the integration process underway in the developing 
South.
<p>
During one session, Chilean activist Sandra Larrain warned of the threat 
posed by some of these integration initiatives, because the agreements being 
negotiated in certain sectors will violate the constitutional framework of 
individual countries, and there are contradictions between the needs of the 
state and those of their citizens.
<p>
Larrain noted that even projects with a progressive façade, like the 
integration of South American oil and gas resources, serve to "guarantee the 
security of investments and market monopolies without state control, while 
consumers assume the costs."
<p>
A great deal of discussion also focussed on the concept of democracy. 
Participants spoke of countries that had been "liberated through elections," 
such as Venezuela, Brazil and Bolivia, but stressed that "it should be the 
people who develop their own projects."
<p>
For instance, one of the panels concluded that the Venezuelan government of 
Hugo Chávez "should consult the indigenous communities on gas pipeline 
projects," following a presentation on the proposed pipelines stretching 
from Venezuela to the Pacific coast of Colombia and to the Rio de la Plata 
between Argentina and Uruguay, and the environmental impact they will have 
on the thousands of kilometers along their path.
<p>
During the Forum itself, hundreds of indigenous representatives from 
northwestern Venezuela staged a march to protest the coal mining concessions 
on their ancestral lands granted to transnational corporations from North 
America, Europe and Brazil.
<p>
Delegates from the Confederation of Indigenous Nationalities of Ecuador 
(CONAIE) maintained that "we have fought in all the campaigns for 
independence, but when the time comes to design the new architecture of 
states, we are left out."
<p>

The leftward shift seen in many new governments in the region, particularly 
in South America, was also the subject of considerable discussion.
