<p>SAN FRANCISCO - The Sierra Club sued the Department of Defense on Wednesday, saying its failure to complete a key study has stopped construction of more than a dozen wind farms in the Midwest. <br><br>Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld and the Pentagon missed a May deadline for a study on whether the wind farms interfere with military radar, according to the suit filed in U.S. District Court in San Francisco. <br><br><!--/beginimage/-->

The Sierra Club sued the U.S. Department of Defense in federal court Wednesday for allegedly halting construction of new wind farms across the United States by failing to complete a study on whether they interfere with military radar. The suit filed in U.S. District Court claimed that Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and the Pentagon missed a deadline for completing a study that is holding up permits for more than a dozen wind farm projects in the Midwest. 'The end result is the wind industry is being crippled,' said attorney Kristin Henry of the Sierra Club. (AP Photo/Ben Margot)<br>

The Federal Aviation Administration has halted projects in Minnesota, Wisconsin, Illinois, North Dakota, and South Dakota until the agency can determine their impact on the radar. <br><br>"The end result is the wind industry is being crippled," said Kristin Henry, attorney of the Sierra Club. <br><br>The departments of Defense and Homeland Security announced in March they would contest any proposed wind turbines that fell within the "radar field-of-view" of long-range air defense systems. <br><br>"Our goal is not to put up roadblocks to these wind farms but to preserve the safety of our airspace," spokeswoman Eileen Lainez said. <br><br>Delayed construction on wind farms could make developers ineligible for federal tax credits available until the end of 2007, Henry said. <br><br>Concern over the study has created an "uncertain situation" for developers considering new wind farm projects, said Christine Real de Azua, spokeswoman for the American Wind Energy Association. <br><br>Wind became the second-greatest source of new power generated in the United States last year after natural gas, according to the group.
