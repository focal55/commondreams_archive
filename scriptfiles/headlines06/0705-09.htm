<p>The controversy and confusion surrounding Mexico's presidential election 
deepened Tuesday as electoral officials released new results that further 
tightened the razor-thin gap between left-of-center candidate Andres Manuel 
Lopez Obrador and front-running conservative Felipe Calderon.

Campaign officials for Lopez Obrador demanded a full recount, insisting 
that the official preliminary results, which had been released hours after the 
Sunday voting, were plagued by errors and that their candidate had won the 
election. 
<P>Federal Electoral Institute officials were under mounting public criticism 
Tuesday for not counting some 2.6 million ballots that they deemed had 
"inconsistencies" because of conflicting information or blank entries. At a 
hastily called evening news conference, institute officials finally released 
these votes, which narrowed Calderon's lead from 1.04 percent to 0.64 percent. 
<P>Election officials also noted that the initial count did not include an 
additional 827,317 ballots that were nullified because of undisclosed errors or 
approximately 800,000 ballots that did not arrive to counting centers on time. 
<P>With Calderon now leading by only 257,532 votes out of more than 41 
million cast, Mexico seems poised for an acrimonious, drawn-out post-electoral 
struggle strikingly similar to the  Florida recount in the 2000 U.S. 
presidential race. 
<P>Government and political party officials say the overall process, together 
with court appeals, could drag on for days, weeks or even months, although 
nobody seemed quite sure how all the complicated electoral and legal machinery 
would unfold. 

<P>The elections institute is scheduled to begin a final count today at 300 
district offices across the country, where the polling-place summary reports 
will be read aloud before representatives of all political parties. The final 
tally is expected to be announced no later than Sunday. 
<P>It is unclear whether the Lopez Obrador campaign's demand for a 
ballot-by-ballot recount will be met. 
<P>"We are convinced of the victory of our candidate," said Lopez Obrador's 
campaign manager, Jesus Ortega. "We demand a recount vote by vote, report by 
report, polling station by polling station." 
<P>Calderon campaign officials downplayed the demand. 
<P>"In this election, Calderon is leading and that will be confirmed when the 
counting by all the election boards is finished," said German Martinez, 
representative of Calderon's National Action Party, or PAN. 
<P>The administration of President Vicente Fox, who also belongs to the PAN, 
jumped into the fray by trying to quash the request. Interior Secretary Carlos 
Abascal said recounting every ballot was "physically impossible and also 
legally impossible." However, Abascal has no authority over electoral issues, 
which are in the hands of the autonomous electoral institute. 
<P>Luis Carlos Ugalde, the institute's president, did not reject the recount 
request but made a not-so-veiled warning to Lopez Obrador: "For the good of 
democracy, the (institute) emphatically implores the political parties to 
behave responsibly," Ugalde told a news conference Tuesday night. 
<P>The fast-moving electoral controversy appears to be driven as much by 
Lopez Obrador's grassroots supporters as by the candidate himself, and it has 
illustrated the emerging power of Mexico's bloggers. 
<P>On Monday morning, Lopez Obrador had stated meekly in public that he would 
accept defeat if announced by the Federal Electoral Institute. That appearance, 
in which his haggard face seemed depressed and defeated, detonated a whirlwind 
of Internet organizing. Within hours, his supporters had deluged the 
headquarters of Lopez Obrador's Democratic Revolution Party, or PRD, with 
e-mails alleging inconsistencies in the vote counting and reporting process. 
<P>PRD bloggers furiously gathered allegations about fraud and distributed 
instructions on how to report problems to the PRD campaign and how to contact 
the media. By Monday night, Lopez Obrador had emerged again and announced that 
his party's lawyers would lodge legal appeals with the electoral institute's 
independent tribunal.  He cited several photos of apparently contrasting poll 
booth count documents that had been sent to him, and he repeatedly asked his 
followers to keep up the e-mail barrage.  
<P>"In the meantime, we are going to ask, or keep asking, the citizens to 
keep helping us find many inconsistencies," said Lopez Obrador. 
<P>The Lopez Obrador campaign also made it clear that they were preparing a 
complex, Florida-style legal challenge. Party officials said they were busy 
printing 5 million flyers declaring their man to be Mexico's next president and 
calling for organized protests. 
<P>However, some PRD officials seemed nervous about unleashing the grassroots 
anger of their supporters, who in past years have been well known for their 
sit-ins, highway blockades and other forms of raucous civil disobedience. 
<P>The PRD's mayor-elect of Mexico City, Marcelo Ebrard, tried to dissuade 
organizers from carrying out a protest march through downtown scheduled for 
today.  
<P>"This isn't convenient for us at this moment," he said. "We don't want to 
fall into the trap of rejecting the whole electoral process."
