<p>Two Oakland police officers working undercover at an anti-war protest in 
May 2003 got themselves elected to leadership positions in an effort to 
influence the demonstration, documents released Thursday show. 
<P>The department assigned the officers to join activists protesting the U.S. 
war in Iraq and the tactics that police had used at a demonstration a month 
earlier, a police official said last year in a sworn deposition. 
<P>At the first demonstration, <a href="http://www.commondreams.org/headlines03/0407-07.htm">police fired nonlethal bullets</a> and bean bags 
at demonstrators who blocked the Port of Oakland's entrance in a protest 
against two shipping companies they said were helping the war effort. Dozens of 
activists and longshoremen on their way to work suffered injuries ranging from 
welts to broken bones and have won nearly $2 million in legal settlements from 
the city. 
<P>The extent of the officers' involvement in the subsequent march May 12, 
2003, led by Direct Action to Stop the War and others, is unclear. But in a 
deposition related to a lawsuit filed by protesters, Deputy Police Chief Howard 
Jordan said activists had elected the undercover officers to "plan the route of 
the march and decide, I guess, where it would end up and some of the places 
that it would go." 
<P>It was revealed later that the California Anti-Terrorism Information 
Center, which was established by the state attorney general's office to help 
local police agencies fight terrorism, had posted an alert about the April 
protest. Oakland police had also monitored online postings by the 
longshoremen's union regarding its opposition to the war. 
<P>The documents showing that police subsequently tried to influence a 
demonstration were released Thursday by the American Civil Liberties Union, as 
part of a report criticizing government surveillance of political activists 
since the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. The ACLU said the documents came 
from the lawsuit over the police use of force. 
<P>Jordan, in his deposition in April 2005, said under questioning by 
plaintiffs' attorney Jim Chanin that undercover Officers Nobuko Biechler and 
Mark Turpin had been elected to be leaders in the May 12 demonstration an hour 
after meeting protesters that day. 

<P>Asked who had ordered the officers to infiltrate the group, Jordan said, 
"I don't know if there is one particular person, but I think together we 
probably all decided it would be a good idea to have some undercover officers 
there." 
<P>Several months after the rally, Jordan told a city police review board 
examining the April 2003 port clash that "our ability to gather intelligence on 
these groups and this type of operation needs to be improved," according to a 
transcript provided by the ACLU. 
<P>"I don't mean same-day intelligence," Jordan told the civilian review 
panel. "I'm talking about long-term intelligence gathering." 
<P>He noted that "two of our officers were elected leaders within an hour on 
May 12." The idea was "to gather the information and maybe even direct them to 
do something that we want them to do," Jordan said. 
<P>"I call that being totalitarian," said Jack Heyman, a longshoremen's union 
member who took part in the May 12 march. He said he was not certain whether he 
had any contact with the officers that day. 
<P>Jordan declined to comment when reached at his office Thursday. In his 
deposition, he said the Police Department no longer allows such undercover 
work. 
<P>City Attorney John Russo said he was not familiar with the police 
infiltration of the protest, but said the city had made "significant changes" 
in its approach toward demonstrations after the port incident. Police enacted a 
new crowd-control policy limiting the use of nonlethal force in 2004. 
<P>The ACLU said the Oakland case was one of several instances in which 
police agencies had spied on legitimate political activity since 2001. 
<P>Mark Schlosberg, who directs the ACLU's police policy work and wrote the 
report released Thursday, cited previously reported instances of spying on 
groups in Santa Cruz and Fresno in addition to the Oakland case. He called on 
state Attorney General Bill Lockyer and local police to ensure that law-abiding 
activist groups don't come under government investigation. 
<P>"It's very important that there be regulation up front to prevent these 
kinds of abuses from occurring," Schlosberg said at a news conference. 
<P>Schlosberg said the state needs an independent inspector looking into 
complaints and keeping an eye on intelligence gathering at such agencies as the 
California National Guard and the state Department of Homeland Security.  
<P>Tom Dresslar, a spokesman for Lockyer, said the attorney general had not 
yet read the ACLU report. But he said his boss "won't abide violations of civil 
liberties. There's no room in this state or anywhere in this country for 
monitoring the activity of groups merely because they have a political 
viewpoint." 
<P>Following the Oakland port protest and disclosures about the monitoring of 
activists, Lockyer issued guidelines in 2003 stating that police must suspect 
that a crime has been committed before collecting intelligence on activist 
groups. 
<P>But Schlosberg said the ACLU had surveyed 94 law enforcement agencies last 
year and found that just eight were aware of the guidelines. Only six had 
written policies restricting surveillance activities, he said.
