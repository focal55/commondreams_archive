<p> <blockquote><i>"April 6 2003. I have been shot at, gassed, chased by soldiers, had sound grenades thrown within metres of me, been hit by falling debris and been in the way of a 10-tonne D-9 that didn't stop. As we approached, I kept expecting a part of my body to be hit by an 'invisible' force and shot of pain. It took a huge amoung of will to continue. I wondered what it would be like to be shot, and strangely I wasn't too scared. It is strange to know that each night people are shot and killed for breaking military curfew, and in the darkness on the north west side there is an Israeli settlement and a few hundred metres away with military snipers in between and any one of the four of us could be being watched through a sniper's sights at this moment. The certainty is that they are watching, and it is in the decision of any one Israeli soldier or settler that my life depends. I know that I'd probably never know what hit me, but it's part of the job to be as visible as possible." Five days after he wrote these words, Tom Hurndall was shot by Israeli forces and later died.</i></blockquote>
<p>The Attorney General was called upon to consider the prosecution of five 
  senior Israeli officers after an inquest jury found that a British student 
  had been murdered by one of their soldiers.
<p>
  In a rare move, the coroner, Andrew Reid, concluded the inquest into Tom 
  Hurndall's death by revealing that he would write to Lord Goldsmith to 
  explore further legal action relating to the 22-year-old's death.

        <!--/endimage/-->Mr Hurndall &shy; a photojournalism student who travelled to Gaza along with a 
  group of peace activists &shy; was trying to save children from a volley of 
  bullets when he was hit in the head in April 2003. He never recovered 
  consciousness and died nine months later in a hospital in London. 
</p>
<p>
  Three weeks after the shooting, the British cameraman James Miller, 34, was 
  shot dead by another soldier from the same unit just a mile away. 
</p>
<p>
  While an Israeli soldier was eventually convicted in Israel of manslaughter 
  in Mr Hurndall's case after a protracted fight by his family, the jury at St 
  Pancras Coroner's Court took it a step further and decided unanimously that 
  he had been killed unlawfully and intentionally. 
</p>
<p>
  Dr Reid added that he had written to Lord Goldsmith: "On the basis 
  that, although an individual has been prosecuted, there are wider issues.'' 
  The Government, he said, had an obligation to protect British citizens from 
  being killed in similar circumstances.

</p>
<p>
  The legal option available to Mr Hurndall's family include the Attorney 
  General authorising an extradition request under the Geneva Convention to 
  try the five men in a British court for alleged war crimes. He could also 
  pursue a war crimes prosecution in the International Criminal Court.
</p>
<p>
  In an eerie premonition of the fate that awaited him, Mr Hurndall wrote in 
  his diary upon arrival in Rafah days earlier of the horror that greeted him, 
  including the regular shootings, gassings and use of sound grenades by 
  troops. 
</p>
<p>
  "The certainty is that they are watching and it is on the decision of 
  any one Israeli soldier or settler that my life depends. I know that I'd 
  probably never know what hit me, but it's part of the job to be as visible 
  as possible," he wrote. His last words to a young Palestinian man were 
  that he and his fellow activists from the International Solidarity Movement, 
  "wanted to do something to make a difference''. 
</p>
<p>
  On 11 April 2003, just hours after two Palestinian teenagers were shot and 
  killed for no apparent reason, the activists were trying to set up a tent to 
  block the Israeli tanks when shots rang out from a watchtower. 
</p>

<p>
  A group of children playing nearby scattered, but three froze in fear. Mr 
  Hurndall rescued a five-year-old boy before running back for two little 
  girls. As he bent down to pick one up, he was hit in the head. He died days 
  before his 21st birthday. 
</p>
<p>
  The inquest yesterday saw graphic footage of the young man wearing a high 
  visibility orange top being carried away, bleeding heavily, by panicked 
  colleagues. The jury heard that, as Mr Hurndall's family from north London 
  dealt with constant obstruction and deception by the Israeli authorities, 
  they were "astonished and shocked'' not to receive any high-profile 
  support from either Tony Blair or the Foreign Secretary, Jack Straw. It fell 
  to his father, Anthony Hurndall, to piece together the events of that day 
  which contradicted the original assertion that the Israel Defence Force had 
  fired at a Palestinian gunman in camouflage. At one point, in an armoured 
  convoy with British embassy officials, the family were shot at themselves, 
  said his mother, Jocelyn.
</p>
<p>
  After several months, Sergeant Taysir Hayb conceded that he had fired at Mr 
  Hurndall, but insisted he had aimed 10cm away. He admitted that he had only 
  sought permission to fire after hitting Mr Hurndall and was later convicted 
  of manslaughter and obstruction of justice and sentenced to eight years. But 
  he told the court he was acting under orders. Mr Hurndall Snr said: "
  Our view is this soldier was doing no more than what was expected of him. It 
  has become very clear to me that shooting civilians was a regular army 
  activity in that area."
</p>
<p>
  The Israeli authorities refused to co-operate with the inquest and Mr 
  Hurndall said those higher up the command &shy; including Generals Jiora Eiland 
  and Doron Almog, as well as a colonel, deputy brigadier- general and captain 
  &shy; should be held accountable. 

</p>
<p>
  Michael Mansfield QC, on behalf of the family, said yesterday the British 
  Government should pressure the Israelis to prosecute the senior officers, 
  seek extradition or a European arrest warrant. It was only through the 
  family's "harrowing struggle", he said, that the rare prosecution 
  of the junior soldier had been achieved. 
</p>
<p>
  He continued: "It is about time a few demands were made of the Israeli 
  government. It is time the Government complies with its own obligations and 
  at least states to this family and the Miller family that they are 
  considering instigating proceedings under the act [Geneva Convention] which 
  is part of our domestic legislation. This is exactly the sort of case they 
  should be using it for and they have done nothing about it."
</p>
<p>
  Another British inquest ruled last week that cameraman James Miller, 34, had 
  been murdered by an Israeli soldier. He was gunned down while making a 
  documentary about the impact of the conflict on Palestinian children in the 
  Rafah refugee camp in May 2003. Last December, an inquest found that Briton 
  Ian Hook, who was leading a UN reconstruction programme in the Jenin refugee 
  camp, was a victim of a "deliberate killing"in November 2002. 
</p>
<p>
  Tom Hurndall arrived in Rafah after hearing of the death of Rachel Corrie, 
  an American peacekeeper. She died on 17 March 2003 from injuries caused by 
  an Israeli army bulldozer while she was trying to stop the Rafah refugee 
  camp being demolished. Mr Hurndall Snr: "We have achieved a great deal 
  more than anyone expected and I don't see why we should not achieve more."</p>
