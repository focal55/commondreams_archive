John Prescott has given vent to his private feelings about the Bush 
  presidency, summing up George Bush's administration in a single word: crap.

The Deputy Prime Minister's condemnation of President Bush and his approach 
  to the Middle East could cause a diplomatic row but it will please Labour 
  MPs who are furious about Tony Blair's backing of the United States over the 
  bombing of Lebanon.
</p>
<p>

  The remark is said to have been made at a private meeting in Mr Prescott's 
  Whitehall office on Tuesday with Muslim MPs and other Labour MPs with 
  constituencies representing large Muslim communities. Muslim MPs wanted to 
  press home their objections to British foreign policy and discuss ways of 
  improving relations with the Muslim communities.
</p>
<p>
  Some of the MPs present said yesterday they could not remember Mr Prescott 
  making the remark. He has been at pains to avoid breaking ranks with Mr 
  Blair in public although he is believed to have raised concern about the 
  bombing of Lebanon at a private meeting of the Cabinet. But Harry Cohen, the 
  MP whose constituency includes Walthamstow, scene of some of the police 
  raids in the alleged "terror plot" investigation, said Mr Prescott 
  had definitely used the word "crap" about the Bush administration.
</p>
<p>
   "He was talking in the context of the 'road map' in the Middle East. 
  He said he only gave support to the war on Iraq because they were promised 
  the road map. But he said the Bush administration had been crap on that. We 
  all laughed and he said to an official, 'Don't minute that'." Mr Cohen 
  added: "We also had a laugh when he said old Bush is just a cowboy with 
  his Stetson on. But then he said, 'I can hardly talk about that can I?'
</p>
<p>
  Last night, an official from the Deputy Prime Minister's office said: "
  These discussions are intended to be private and remain within the four 
  walls. They are private so that there may be frank discussions."
</p>
<p>
  And today Mr Prescott issued a statement in which he said: "This is an 
  inaccurate report of a private conversation and it is not my view. "

</p>
<p>
  Told that others at the meeting could not recall the words, Mr Cohen said: "
He did. I stand by that."
</p>
<p>
  Many Labour MPs have been infuriated by the spectacle of Mr Bush and Mr 
  Blair jointly supporting the Israeli action. The Labour MPs went to see Mr 
  Prescott to lodge their criticism of the Government's foreign policy and 
  some said last night that they would be delighted if he did break ranks over 
  the Bush administration following the outcry at the bombing of the Lebanon. 
</p>
<p>
  In the private discussions with Mr Prescott, the Labour MPs representing 
  large Muslim communities pulled no punches in their criticism of Mr Blair 
  for giving his backing to Mr Bush. Another of those who was contacted about 
  the conversations did not deny Mr Prescott's words, but laughed and said: "
I can't discuss that." When asked whether he had heard Mr Prescott use 
  the "C-word", he said: "I don't remember that."
</p>
<p>
  The Deputy Prime Minister is said to have made it clear he strongly backed 
  the efforts by Mr Blair to persuade the Bush administration to revive the 
  road map for Palestine and Israel. Mr Blair has given a commitment that he 
  will give the peace process his priority when he returns from his holiday in 
  the Caribbean.
</p>

<p>
   "There was a very robust exchange of views," said the MP. " 
  We had a row about community relations. The Deputy Prime Minister was told 
  in no uncertain terms that the Government was relying too much on the elders 
  in the Muslim community who didn't have the credibility that was needed."</p>
<p>
  Muslim Labour MPs also told Mr Prescott that they needed to retain their own 
  credibility in their communities, which was one of the reasons why they had 
  signed a controversial letter calling for a change in British foreign 
  policy. They said it was not helpful for the Government to have attacked 
  their letter.
</p>
<p>
  Mr Prescott has been accused in the past of making his feelings known about 
  the Republican administration in the White House. He became friendly with Al 
  Gore, the unsuccessful Democrat presidential candidate in 2000, during the 
  negotiations on the Kyoto treaty and allegedly told Mr Gore after his defeat 
  that he was sorry he lost the race to Mr Bush.
</p>
<p>
  Mr Prescott is also known to have used the word "crap" in relation 
  to political events before. Earlier this month, he angrily rejected claims 
  that he could resign over the row about his links to the bid by the tycoon 
  Philip Anschutz for a super-casino at the Millennium Dome as "a load of 
  crap".
</p>
<p>

  Mr Prescott was left in charge by Mr Blair when the Prime Minister went on 
  his delayed holiday but has largely taken a back seat while John Reid, the 
  Home Secretary, has led for the Government on security and the alleged 
  terror plot to blow up planes across the Atlantic.
</p>
<p>
  Behind the scenes, Mr Prescott had to contend with growing backbench demands 
  for Parliament to be recalled to debate the crisis in the Middle East. It 
  remains an option, in spite of the ceasefire in the Lebanon. Campaigners 
  claimed they had the signatures of more than 150 MPs from all parties for a 
  recall. Significantly, they included Ann Keen, the parliamentary private 
  secretary to Gordon Brown, the Chancellor, who is on paternity leave 
  following the birth of his second child. Jim Sheridan, the Labour MP for 
  Paisley and Renfrewshire North, resigned as the parliamentary private 
  secretary to the defence ministers over the bombing of Lebanon.
</p>
<p>
  Mr Prescott has been keen to show Labour MPs that he is prepared to listen 
  to their grievances but has insisted on party discipline to avoid splits. He 
  will be furious at his alleged remarks being repeated, but the signs of 
  dissent within the Cabinet are becoming greater.

   <b>Straight-talker's way with words</b>
</p>
<p>

  * Posing with a crab in a jar at the Millennium Dome, while Peter Mandelson 
  was standing for election to Labour's ruling national executive committee, 
  he said to cameramen: "You know what his name is? He's called Peter. Do 
  you think you will get on the executive, Peter?"
</p>
<p>
  * When asked why a car was transporting him and his wife 200 yards to the 
  Labour Party Conference in 1999:
</p>
<p>
   "Because of the security reasons for one thing and second, my wife 
  doesn't like to have her hair blown about. Have you got another silly 
  question?"
</p>
<p>
  * On the Millennium Dome: "If we can't make this work, we're not much 
  of a government."
</p>
<p>
  * "The green belt is a Labour achievement, and we mean to build on it."
 (Radio interview, January 1998)

</p>
<p>
  * On the Tories at the 1996 Labour conference: "They are up to their 
  necks in sleaze. The best slogan for their conference next week is " 
  Life's better under the Tories" - sounds like one of Steven Norris's 
  chat-up lines."
</p>
<p>
  * When asked by a journalist about Peter Law's decision to quit the Labour 
  Party after 35 years: "Why are you asking me about this? I don't care, 
  it's a Welsh situation, I'm a national politician."
