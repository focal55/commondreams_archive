<P>President Bush provoked criticism from all sides and appeared to further alienate his own conservative base yesterday with compromise proposals on the issue of immigration. 
<P>In a televised speech from the Oval Office on Monday night, Mr Bush issued a call to find a &#147;rational middle ground&#148; on immigration, proposing tougher border security while giving millions of immigrants the chance of US citizenship. 
<P>But conservatives, moderate Republicans, Democrats and Hispanics all found fault with his plan. 
<P>His decision to deploy 6,000 National Guard troops next month to California, Texas, Arizona and New Mexico to beef up security along the Mexican border drew a mixed response from the states&#146; governors, while members of both parties said the troops were already stretched too thin in Iraq. 

<P>Mr Bush hoped to pave the way for a deal on immigration reform on Capitol Hill, where the Senate began debating the issue yesterday. 
<P>By focusing on border security, he tried to mollify conservative Republicans in the House of Representatives, where a hardline immigration bill was passed in December that would see the border walled off and illegal immigrants turned into criminals. The bill offers no route to citizenship. 
<P>An alternative Senate Bill would grant most of the 12 million illegal immigrants in the US the chance to become citizens. The&nbsp;one is set to be passed within weeks. 
<P>In a politically courageous move, Mr Bush embraced the Senate&#146;s proposal. Border security and citizenship &#147;are not contradictory goals&#148;, he said. &#147;America can be a lawful society and a welcoming society at the same time.&#148; 
<P>Mr Bush was treading a slender path: trying not to alienate his conservative base, while at the same time trying to entice the rapidly growing Hispanic population into the Republican party. But it was clear he had done little to sway either side. 
<P>House Republicans left Mr Bush in no doubt about the uphill battle he faces in trying to forge a compromise between the House and Senate bills. 
<P>Roy Blunt, the House&#146;s Republican whip, said: &#147;I have real concerns about moving forward with a guest worker programme.&#148; 
<P>Fellow Republican Walter Jones said Mr Bush was trying to &#147;appease&#148; conservatives with the National Guard deployment, and it would not work. 

<P>Immigrant groups also decried the troop deployment, saying that it sent a message that &#147;immigrants are the number one enemy of this country&#148;.
