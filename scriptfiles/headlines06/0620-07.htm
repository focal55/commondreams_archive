<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p>As a candidate, President Bush promised to eliminate a $5 billion construction backlog in national parks. Yet under his watch, the amount of unfinished maintenance may have doubled, worsening an already bleak picture.</p>
<p>Bush was Texas governor and in a tight race with then-Vice President Al Gore when he made the pledge in a stop along the Skykomish River in Monroe, Wash.</p>
<p>It was 55 days before the election in 2000, and the Republican nominee was taking aim at Gore's signature issue, the environment.</p>
<p>Bush blamed the "Clinton-Gore administration" for letting the maintenance lag in the 390-unit National Park System. He told a crowd of supporters that he would "eliminate within five years the National Park Service's $4.9 billion major maintenance and resource protection backlog." To do that, he said he would spend $1 billion a year in additional money over five years.</p>
<p>The agency has much to maintain: 22,000 campgrounds, 21,000 buildings, 17,000 miles of trails, 10,000 miles of roads, 5,000 homes, and 3,000 facilities that treat sewage or water.</p>
<p>Bush's campaign had latched onto a 1997 estimate by the Park Service of a backlog that Congress' investigative arm said a year later was unreliable.</p>
<p>The latest estimate &#151; from Library of Congress researchers in March 2005 &#151; put the backlog at between $4.5 billion and $9.7 billion.</p>

<p>The White House says Bush is "fulfilling his commitment to address the park maintenance backlog."</p>
<p>"They claimed to have fixed the problem, and they didn't," said Blake Selzer, legislative director for the National Parks Conservation Association, an advocacy group.</p>
<p>By next year, the Bush administration will have spent $5.6 billion on park maintenance and will have completed more than 6,000 construction projects. The Park Service is converting to a new inventory system for tracking repairs.</p>
<p>About $700 million of that spending is new money, Park Service budget figures show. That is far short of Bush's $1 billion-a-year goal. His administration has stopped providing its own backlog estimates.</p>
<p>The National Park Service director, Fran Mainella, said Bush has at least helped focus much-needed attention on the problem.</p>
<p>"There is never an elimination of a backlog," she told the AP. "I don't ever think there's actually going to be a number that you can ever label for backlog because it continues to evolve."</p>
