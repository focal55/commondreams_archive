ALBANY -- A group of protesters in wheelchairs from Not Dead Yet injected additional drama into the normally contentious debates at this year's conference of the American Society for Bioethics and Humanities.

<p> "Nothing about us without us!" they shouted, holding up for 20 minutes the opening on Thursday of the two-day conference at the Crowne Plaza Hotel.
<p> The Not Dead Yet contingent, about 24 disabled people who oppose assisted suicide and euthanasia, underscored the timeliness of the conference's title: "Bioethics & Politics: The Future of Bioethics in a Divided Democracy."

<p>Conference organizers told hotel security and police officers summoned to the scene not to arrest the protesters and to allow a representative of the group to speak.

<p>"We were able to defuse it without relying on force," said Sean Philpott, an organizer and associate director of the Alden March Bioethics Institute at Albany Medical College, the conference sponsor.

<p>"It was clear the group wanted a photo op with their members being arrested and hauled away in handcuffs, but we denied them that opportunity," Philpott said.

<p>By Friday morning, conversation among the 200 attendees, who came from across the United States, Canada and Japan, had moved beyond a discussion of the protesters. Conference participants focused instead on a panel discussion about politics with two conservative and two liberal bioethicists.

<p>Bioethics is a relatively new and hybrid discipline that attempts to explicate ethical questions that arise at the intersection of fields that include biology, law, philosophy, medicine and theology.

<p>"The panel this morning showed that we can disagree and yet do it in a constructive and polite way," said Dr. John Balint, founder of the Alden March Bioethics Institute of Albany Medical College.

<p>"It's good that we can get all our differing views on issues out in the open," Balint said. "It's sad that the Not Dead Yet group feels we've ignored them and they're so angry about things. On the positive side, bioethics has now become established in academia and in public discourse throughout the Capital Region."

<p>Some of the bioethicists, however, continued to debate the merits of Not Dead Yet's argument that they'd not been given a place at the table.

<p>"It's just not true that we've ignored the disabled community," said Bonnie Steinbock, a professor of philosophy at the University at Albany who oversees a dual degree program with Albany Med that leads to a Ph.D. in philosophy and a master's of science in bioethics.

<p>"The problem is that the nation is so politically divided right now that it's hard to find common ground in order to work together on issues of bioethics," Steinbock said.

<p>The conference had the feel, at times, of a red states/blue states electoral map when it came to abortion, evolution, embryonic stem cell research, animal rights, global warming, the morning-after pill and other hot-button topics.

<p>"There is a crisis between politics and science in this country now," said Chris Mooney, Washington correspondent for The Seed magazine and author of "The Republican War on Science."

<p>In his talk on "Politicizing Science," Mooney said the conservative wing of the GOP has created a "war on science" that aims to "ignore or distort accepted scientific information."
<p>It's a political strategy, Mooney argued, meant to pander to the religious right and to keep the political left off-balance. And it's been fairly effective, of late, on issues as varied as global warming and evolution, he said.

<p>"Not that the left is innocent, either, because they can misuse science, too," Mooney said, noting a hyping of facts on certain environmental and animal rights issues.

<p>"At the end of the day, though, the political right is much more guilty than the left when it comes to distorting science," Mooney said.

<p>Of course, at presentations running concurrently with Mooney's, the political right's perspective was ascendant. That's the thing about bioethics, participants suggested: It's more about the journey than the destination.

<p>Consensus is generally in short supply when this group gets together, but at least decorum was in abundance this year.

<p>"I think it's a sign of maturity among the field that we now have civilized discourse," said Philpott, who appeared stressed that the conference was running 25 minutes behind schedule and attendees were slow to take their seats.

<p>"The discussions have been respectful and friendly, but trying to keep 200 bioethicists on time is like wrangling cats," he said.
