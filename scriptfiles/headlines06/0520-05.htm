<p>NEW YORK  -- Senator John McCain of Arizona received a cantankerous
reception during his appearance at the New School commencement Friday,
where dozens of faculty members and students turned their backs and raised
signs in protest and a distinguished student speaker pointedly mocked him
as he sat silently nearby.</p>

    The historically liberal university has been roiled in controversy in
recent weeks over the selection of McCain, a conservative Republican and
likely 2008 presidential candidate, to deliver the commencement address.</p>

<p>   Some 1,200 students and faculty signed petitions asking the university
president, former Nebraska Sen. Bob Kerrey, to rescind the invitation.
Petitioners said McCain's support for the Iraq war and opposition to gay
rights and legal abortion do not keep with the prevailing views on campus.</p>
<p>   Kerrey, a Democrat who served in the Senate with McCain and, like
McCain, is a decorated Vietnam War veteran, addressed the controversy
almost immediately after the 2,700 graduates and thousands of other parents
and friends filed into Madison Square Garden for the ceremony.</p>
<p>   "Sen. McCain, you have much to teach us," Kerrey said to a smattering of
boos and hisses. He urged students to exercise the open-mindedness he said
was at the heart of the university's progressive history.</p>
<p>But Kerrey's remarks were immediately overshadowed by those of Jean Sara
Rohe, one of two distinguished seniors invited by the university's deans to
address the graduates.</p>
<p>Beginning by singing a wistful folk tune calling for world peace, Rohe
announced she had thrown out her prepared remarks to address the McCain
controversy directly.</p>
<p>"The senator does not reflect the ideals upon which this university was
founded," Rohe proclaimed to loud cheers, with McCain sitting just a few
feet away.</p>
<p>She added that she knew what McCain would be saying to the graduates
since he had promised to deliver the same speech he gave at Rev. Jerry
Falwell's Liberty University last weekend and Columbia University on
Tuesday.</p>

<p>"He will tell us we are young and too naive to have valid opinions,"
Rohe said. "I am young and though I don't possess the wisdom that time
affords us, I do know that pre-emptive war is dangerous. And I know that
despite all the havoc that my country has wrought overseas in my name,
Osama bin Laden still has not been found, nor have those weapons of mass
destruction."</p>
<p>Indeed, it was McCain's decision to address Liberty that set off the
protests at the New School during the past several weeks.</p>
<p>Known for his maverick streak, McCain as a 2000 presidential candidate
famously called Falwell one of the "agents of intolerance" hurting the
Republican party. But recently, as McCain has begun laying the groundwork
for another White House bid, he has sought to shore up his conservative
credentials.</p>
<p>McCain later thanked Rohe for her "Cliff's notes" version of his speech,
and then, as expected, delivered remarks that were nearly identical to his
earlier appearances.</p>
<p>He reaffirmed his support for the Iraq war but urged debate and dissent.
And he repeated the theme of youthful self-assuredness mocked just moments
before by Rohe.</p>
<p>"When I was a young man, I was quite infatuated with self-expression,
and rightly so because, if memory conveniently serves, I was so much more
eloquent, well-informed and wiser than anyone else I knew," McCain said. He
added that he would have been right at home in the opinionated world of
blogs.</p>
<p>As he spoke, several dozen students and faculty turned their backs to
him and lifted signs saying "Our commencement is not your platform."</p>
<p>A few students yelled catcalls at McCain, saying things like "full of
it," and "We're graduating, not voting."</p>
<p>Kerrey later retook the stage to praise McCain and Rohe's speeches as
"two acts of bravery," while suggesting the hecklers weren't nearly as
courageous as those who took the stage.</p>

<p>"Will you stand and say what you believe when you know that heckling and
loudness and boos will arise?" Kerrey asked.</p>
