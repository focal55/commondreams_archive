<p>BOSTON -  Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said she understands why students and faculty at Boston College are preparing to protest as she receives an honorary degree, and she embraced their right to object even as she defended the war in Iraq.
</div>
<p class="inside-copy">"People have the right to protest, but I hope when they protest they realize also that people now have a right to protest in Baghdad and Kabul, and that's a very big breakthrough for the international community," Rice said Monday before the BC commencement.</p><p class="inside-copy">"I think it's just fine for people to protest as long as they do so in a way that doesn't try to have a monopoly on the conversation," Rice told WBZ-AM in an interview. "Others have right to say what they think as well."</p><p class="inside-copy">Ever since Boston College announced earlier this month that Rice would speak at the school's graduation and receive an honorary degree, reaction has ranged from outrage to enthusiasm.</p><p class="inside-copy">"We are very concerned as Catholics that Boston College has invited Condoleezza Rice, who is an architect of this foreign policy and war. ... That is hardly something to honor," said Brayton Shanley, a BC alumnus and co-founder of Agape, a lay Catholic organization that has been working with students to organize the protests.</p><p class="inside-copy">At the ceremony Monday, demonstrators planned to wear black armbands and turn their backs when Rice is awarded an honorary law degree. Students also will hand out leaflets and stickers with messages, including "Not in my name" and "No honorary degree."</p><p class="inside-copy">University spokesman Jack Dunn told the student newspaper, <i>The Heights</i>, that all have agreed to keep their protests respectful and not disrupt the ceremonies.</p><p class="inside-copy">University officials also expect protests off-campus.</p><p class="inside-copy">A letter written by two theology professors, and signed by more than 10% of the faculty, kicked off the opposition to Rice.</p><p class="inside-copy">"On the levels of both moral principle and practical moral judgment, Secretary Rice's approach to international affairs is in fundamental conflict with Boston College's commitment to the values of the Catholic and Jesuit traditions and is inconsistent with the humanistic values that inspire the university's work," the letter said.</p><p class="inside-copy">The Rev. David Hollenbach, one of the letter writers, has said he has no objection to Rice speaking, but said she doesn't deserve an honorary degree.</p><p class="inside-copy">Steve Almond, an adjunct writing professor, resigned from his post over the matter.</p><p class="inside-copy">"I think Americans have lost sight of the idea of sacrifice," he said. "This is a relatively small sacrifice for me."</p><p class="inside-copy">Rice said the use of force in Iraq was "the right thing."</p><p class="inside-copy">"I'm not surprised that there was controversy, but my understanding is that there are views on both sides of the issue," she said Sunday at meeting with a small group of reporters.</p><p class="inside-copy">Despite the opposition, there have been expressions of support for Rice, a former provost at Stanford University.</p><p class="inside-copy">Political science professor Marc Landy has said the opposition letter was a "grotesque mistake" and sent his own letter asking colleagues not to sign it.</p><p class="inside-copy">Justin Galacki, who is graduating from the Carroll School of Management and is president of the College Democrats, said inviting Rice was inconsistent with the school's Jesuit teachings, but it's an honor to have "one of the most influential people in the world" at Boston College.</p><p align="center">Copyright 2006 The Associated Press</p>
