Although organizers squeezed dozens of extra chairs into The Library Center auditorium, it was standing room only Wednesday at a panel discussion with former CIA analyst Ray McGovern.<P>

The discussion, which followed a daylong series of films about the war in Iraq, clearly showed Ozarkers' interest in the issues being addressed.<P>"He dispels lots of the myths, so people can form their own opinions," said Ryan Foo, a student at Missouri State University. "It's something you need to know, because it affects the whole world."<P>The crowd of more than 200 appeared largely sympathetic to McGovern, who spoke about the "fixing" of intelligence in the run-up to the Iraq war.<P>"I go along very much with McGovern," said Fred Walter, 80. "I don't think we're (conducting the war in Iraq) in the proper manner. ... We're gonna get in a bigger mess, and we're alienating our allies."<P>The crowd was less favorable toward panel member Vincent David Jericho, a conservative talk-radio host on local station KSGF.<P>Although Jericho garnered thunderous applause when describing America as "the greatest country in the world," he drew fire after suggesting the U.S. is also "morally superior."<P>Moderator Bob Ranney had to ask the audience to refrain from catcalling after several other comments from Jericho, including his contention that "Jesus wasn't some velveteen wuss, he was a man ..."<P>Jericho characterized the current war on terror as a religious war and defended past statements by the president that American soldiers are "Christian crusaders."<P>"The Bible isn't a book of peace," Jericho said. "Never has been, never will be."<P>Springfield attorney Joe Passanise, also a member of the panel, took a less controversial approach when describing the conflict.<P>"We are in a war not necessarily with a country, but with an ideology," he said. "These people want to kill us ... they want to do away with our way of life."<P>But Passanise later stressed that the conflict is not with Islam in general, but with a minority of religious extremists unwilling to compromise or negotiate.<P>"You can't sit down at a table with people who want to kill you ...," he said. "You can't discuss with that one percent."<P>Bill Belle Isle, 64, said the argument that terrorists want to kill Americans because of "our freedoms" or democracy misses the point.<P>"This thing that they want to kill us &#151; it's true," he said. "But it's because of our policy."<P>Although the overflow crowd included about a dozen twentysomethings, such as Foo, most of those in attendance were older residents.<P>Belle Isle said that's no coincidence.<P>"Most of these folks are old enough to remember Vietnam ... and remember the lessons of 40 years ago," he said.<P>Belle Isle said he's struggled recently to explain the similarities between that conflict and the current war to his children, to little effect. "It's not their fault &#151; they just weren't there."<P>The country's current leadership doesn't seem to understand, either, said Belle Isle, whose son recently returned from a third tour of duty in Iraq.<P>"I think their perspective might be a little different if they were sending their own sons, instead of someone else's," he said. "I just think this war is unjust and foolish."<P>Even those who disagreed with McGovern, such as Jericho and Passanise, praised the citizenship embodied in the lively debate Wednesday.<P>"I don't care if you hate my guts," Jericho told the audience. "(But) everybody needs to get involved."<p align="center">&copy; 2006 Springfield News-Leader</p>
