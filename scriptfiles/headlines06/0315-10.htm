<p>Tony Blair today laid the blame squarely at the door of the Palestinian Authority for yesterday's outbreak of violence across the Gaza Strip and the withdrawal of British monitors from a prison in Jericho.<P>The prime minister told the Commons that he had personally warned the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, that the British personnel would be withdrawn unless security agreements were met.<P>During prime minister's questions, Mr Blair said there could be no long-term peace in the region until the Palestinian authorities were able to maintain law, and the incoming Hamas government recognised Israel's existence and put an end to violence.<P>"If people want progress towards a two state solution, which we have championed in this country - an independent viable Palestinian state living side by side with Israel - then the security within the Palestinian area is of prime concern," Mr Blair said. "We have done everything we can to support them. But we need some help back."<P>Yesterday, Israeli troops stormed the Jericho prison prompting a surge of violence across Palestinian-controlled areas during which at least 11 foreigners were taken hostage. The army's siege, which ended with the surrender of five prisoners accused of assassinating an Israeli cabinet minister in 2001, came after British monitors at the jail withdrew due to security concerns.<P>Mr Blair reiterated yesterday's comments by the foreign secretary, Jack Straw, telling the Commons that British officials had warned the Palestinians during the past three months that the unarmed civilian monitors were at risk and procedures were inadequate.<P>Britain had been "immensely generous" to those in the Palestinian Authority, Mr Blair said, contributing millions of pounds both from government budgets and through its contribution to EU funding.<P>"The agreement was that the Palestinians would take charge [of the Jericho] prison and it would be monitored by us," Mr Blair continued. "We have kept to the agreement every step of the way. The breach was because the proper procedures were not being kept by the Palestinian side."<P>Palestinians today staged a series of protest strikes to voice their anger at yesterday's events and Mr Abbas cut short a visit to Europe to deal with the situation.<P>Meanwhile, Israeli authorities said they were determined to put the detainees on trial for the assassination of Rehavam Zeevi, the country's notorious tourism minister who was shot dead in a Jerusalem hotel in 2001.<P>"Got 'em!" announced one banner newspaper headline, above a large photograph of the Palestinian militant leader Ahmed Saadat being led away blindfolded and handcuffed by Israeli troops.<P>Yesterday's day-long siege came just two weeks before Israel's general election and boosted acting prime minister Ehud Olmert's image as a tough-minded leader. The defence minister, Shaul Mofaz, a member of Mr Olmert's centrist Kadima party, dismissed allegations by Palestinian officials and political opponents that the operation was timed to win over hardline voters.<P>The raid triggered unprecedented Palestinian reprisals against foreigners, amid accusations - denied by the Foreign Office - that the British monitors colluded with Israeli forces over the timing of their withdrawal.<P>Gunmen vandalised western offices and kidnapped 11 foreigners, including four French citizens, two Australians, an American and a South Korean. Three hostages, including a Canadian man, are still being held. The others were released unharmed.<P>"This was a severe blow to the Palestinian Authority and to Abu Mazen [Abbas] personally," said the Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat, who was accompanying Mr Abbas on his European tour.<P>Mr Abbas, on a visit to the ruins of the Jericho prison this afternoon, said that the raid "is an unforgivable crime and an insult to the Palestinian people".<P>The blow to Mr Abbas' prestige comes at a time when he is wrangling over the division of powers with the Islamic militant group Hamas, which is poised to form a new government this month. In the West Bank city of Nablus, hundreds chanted anti-Abbas slogans during a protest.<P>Israeli officials said today they were determined to put Mr Saadat and four other Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine activists on trial for the assassination of Zeevi, but said they will first have to overcome a number of legal hurdles.<P>The four men believed to be directly involved in the assassination were convicted in 2002 by a Palestinian court and sentenced to between one and 18 years in prison. Legal experts said they would have to decide whether they can be tried again. Mr Saadat was not charged. Palestinian officials said at the time they did not believe he was involved in the killing.<P>The outgoing Palestinian foreign minister, Nasser al-Kidwa, said Israel would violate international law by trying the six.<P>Zeevi, an ultranationalist who advocated the expulsion of Palestinians from Israeli-controlled territory, was shot dead in the hallway of a Jerusalem hotel in October 2001, and the PFLP claimed responsibility at the time.<P>Mr Saadat, the four convicted activists, and another man wanted by Israel, took refuge after the killing in the Ramallah compound of the late Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat. A month-long siege of the compound by Israeli troops led to the so-called Ramallah agreement, under which the troops would withdraw in exchange for the six men being imprisoned in the West Bank under British and American supervision.<P>Israeli forces said they launched yesterday's operation to prevent the new Hamas government from carrying out a promise to release the men.
