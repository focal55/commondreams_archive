<p>The lock opens and a heavyset man sporting a black knitted skullcap similar to that worn by the slain Al-Qaeda leader in Iraq, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, leaves a cage at Abu Ghraib prison.
<p>


Saad al-Hayali, 47, was one of 500 detainees at US and Iraqi-run facilities in Iraq released at a ceremony on Friday, as part of a bid by Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki to promote reconciliation and national dialogue among the country's feuding factions.</p>
<p>

Maliki, who announced the initiative June 6, was to disclose details of his plan on Sunday.</p>
<p>

But a conversation with Hayali and several others -- all Sunni Arabs locked up on suspicion of ties to insurgents -- quickly suggests they are not willing to forgive and forget.</p>
<p>

Some may be even more determined after their prison time to take up arms against US and Iraqi forces.</p>
<p>

&quot;I heard about reconciliation and I reject it completely because something built on shaky foundations will not stand up,&quot; Hayali said bluntly.</p>
<p>

More than 2,100 detainees have been set free since June 6, said the spokesman of US detainee operations in Iraq, Lieutenant Colonel Keir-Kevin Curry. He said a total of 2,500 detainees should be released by the end of this month.</p>
<p>




Hayali, a former civil engineer, said reconciliation would be meaningless. He said he does not recognise the legitimacy of the Maliki government, which began a full four-year term in April following elections in December, nor does he recognise the country's new constitution passed last year.</p>
<p>


His objection is that both are based on a US blueprint for sovereignty drafted after the invasion of Iraq in 2003.</p>
<p>

Hayali said he was arrested with his two sons and brother 26 months ago on charges of being &quot;terrorists&quot; and inciting violence in the town Tarmia, a well-known insurgent hotspot north of Baghdad.</p>
<p>

&quot;I did not have a chance to carry a weapon, but I was using words to reject occupation,&quot; he said.</p>

<p>

His sons, aged 17 and 24, were let go a few days later but he and his brother were held at the infamous US-run Abu Ghraib, scene of a major prisoner abuse scandal in 2004. His brother was released a few months ago.</p>
<p>

&quot;The solution to all our problems is God's book. This is the constitution,&quot; Hayali said as he held up a large copy of the Koran, the Muslim holy book.</p>
<p>

&quot;I will sacrifice myself to make this happen; our blood must spill for this book.&quot;</p>
<p>

Hayali embodies the disillusionment of the once-privileged Sunni Arab minority after the fall of Saddam Hussein's regime.</p>

<p>




Many have refused to accept that the reins of power are now in the hands of the majority Shiites, repressed for years under the previous regime.</p>
<p>


Some continue to fuel a bloody insurgency that has branched out into a struggle pitting members of the two Muslim sects against one another.</p>
<p>

&quot;Reconciliation can happen if Iraqis are left alone. We are all brothers,&quot; said Sabir Muslih, 36, who was arrested in October by Iraqi forces and handed to US troops on suspicion of being involved in a roadside bombing.

<p>


&quot;But the problem is foreign countries like Iran. It is another Tehran here now. Iranians pretending to be part of the government slaughtered 18 of my cousins,&quot; he added, referring to Shiite militia death squads.
<p>


Many of Iraq's new leaders maintain very close ties with Shiite Iran, the arch foe of Saddam's ousted regime.
<p>


A sectarian war and the establishment of an Islamic state were the purported aims of Jordanian-born Zarqawi before his death in a US air strike on June 7.
<p>


Zarqawi's alleged right-hand man, an Iraqi Sunni Arab by the name of Mansur al-Mashhadani, was also killed by US forces a week ago. The military said he had been imprisoned for a few months in 2004 and was then released after deemed unthreatening.
<p>


&quot;Many people inside embraced God for real. We used to talk about jihad, and the good news is that it is running in everybody's veins now,&quot; Hayali said.
<p>


&quot;In our prayers we used to keep repeating: God help us implement your law and raise your word high.&quot;
<p>




Asked if there was concern that Abu Ghraib and other detention facilities in Iraq were becoming breeding grounds for militants, Curry said: &quot;One of the things in a democratic process is freedom of religion and we are here to support this.&quot;
<p>



He said that those deemed to be a bad influence on fellow detainees are usually segregated and that all of those released so far have gone through a careful vetting process by a special US-Iraqi board.
<p>


&quot;These detainees have denounced violence and pledged to be good citizens of Iraq,&quot; Curry said, adding that none have been found guilty of bombings, murder, torture or kidnapping.
<p>

He said only 5.6 percent of those released from US-run prisons since January 2005 have been recaptured.
<p>


&quot;I am innocent, someone conspired on me!&quot; screamed an old man in traditional dress from behind a cage at Abu Ghraib before his release.
<p>


&quot;Yes you are right and this applies to 90 percent of you,&quot; Abed Mutlaq al-Juburi, a Sunni Arab MP from northern Iraq, shot back.
<p>


Juburi stood on a shaded, elevated wooden plank under the blazing sun, addressing hundreds of detainees, mostly from areas around Baghdad and the western city of Ramadi, on the other side of a fence.
<p>


Many held copies of the Koran against their chests.
<p>


&quot;Some politicians are trying to draw a wedge between us, but we should not be divided,&quot; he told the men. &quot;Be Sunni, Shiite, Kurd or whatever you want, but we must all live under one tent called Iraq.&quot;
<p>


After the gate to the cage was opened by a US soldier, the men came out one by one to shake Juburi's hand before boarding big buses taking them home.

<p>


Later Juburi insisted in an interview that prisoner releases will not work unless they are combined with a formal apology and compensation to those wrongly detained, along with job opportunities.
<p>


&quot;A hungry person will do anything and the jobless can easily be lured to commit crimes,&quot; he said.
<p>


On Friday, a leading Shiite cleric Sadreddin al-Kubanji, said in his weekly sermon that Maliki was making &quot;a strategic error&quot; by releasing &quot;terrorists and criminals.&quot;

<p>


&quot;If you are a young pious Sunni Arab you are a 'terrorist'. I do not want to be involved in politics or any reconciliation,&quot; said Bakr Abedlkarim, 22, from Baghdad's Adhamiya district.</p>
