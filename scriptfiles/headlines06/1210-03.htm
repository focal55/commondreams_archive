<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->His voice is distinctive — plainspoken and folksy to a fault, with that unmistakable Texan drawl.
<P></P>And he's worried — worried about the number of American dead, the number who will die in the coming weeks and months, but most of all he's worried about how much worse it will be, "if we pull out.<P></P>"I don't want to pull down the flag and come running home with my tail between my legs."<P></P>Later, he says, "I can't get out. I just can't be the architect of surrender."<P></P>The voice is that of Lyndon Baines Johnson; the time, the mid-1960s; the subject, how to get out of Vietnam.<P></P>A decade later, the Stars and Stripes was pulled down and American soldiers did come home, but in the intervening years 58,000 of them perished in the killing fields of Vietnam, as did an estimated 1 million civilian Vietnamese.<P></P>Earlier this year in a hallowed hall of the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library in Boston, Johnson's taped voice came sailing from loudspeakers across an audience of prominent Americans gathered to grapple with the lessons of Vietnam, beneath the swelling storm of the Iraq war.<P></P>Now, months later, their deliberations seem more prescient and relevant than ever as President George W. Bush struggles with a Johnsonian-like dilemma: how to extricate oneself from a mounting mess in which a majority of Americans no longer believe and at the same time salvage America's honour.<P></P>
It is a dilemma — like that of Vietnam — for which there may be no solution.<br>
<br>
Last week, applying the kind of presidential hubris for which he is well known, Bush rebuffed a set of recommendations from a bipartisan, blue-ribbon panel that had convened to counsel a new approach.
<P></P>The Iraq Study Group, led by Republican James Baker and Democrat Lee Hamilton, poured forth with a catalogue of recommendations. But the cumulative message was clear: this war is lost; America must re-learn the lesson that military might alone cannot assure safety; and other forms of statecraft must be applied.<P></P>It was a difficult message for an administration long criticized for having a toolbox full of hammers — and to which everything looks like a nail.<P></P>But some held out hope.<P></P>"This is a pivotal moment in the war," Harvard presidential scholar David Gergen told an interviewer last week. "Just think if we had had a report like this three or four years into the Vietnam War that forced everybody to take a second look, realize how difficult it was, that it was not winnable, that we really ought to move in with some sort of disengagement? We could have saved thousands and thousands of lives."<P></P>Gergen would know. He served in the White House of Gerald Ford on that fateful day in April 1975 when — after 495 sorties — Ford had to call a halt to the helicopters ferrying out loyal South Vietnamese from the roof of the U.S. embassy. It was a scene seared into the American psyche: the final few, desperate and begging, clinging to the struts of the last chopper as it lifted into the muggy air above Saigon, banked, then disappeared.<P></P>Those on the ground were left to their bloody fate.<P></P>As mechanized brigades of the North Vietnamese army advanced, the city collapsed into a cauldron of chaos. An estimated 10,000 were killed and more than 100,000 were placed in "re-education" programs.<P></P></HR>For many analysts, analogies with the Vietnam War are useful; for others, they are anathema.<P></P>Stephen Biddle, a senior fellow in defence policy at the Council on Foreign Relations concedes there are similarities. But he cautions against taking them too far. Vietnam was "a people's war," he notes, a class-based insurgency against a ruling regime. Iraq, by comparison, is a "communal civil war," a battle in which sectarian factions are fighting for survival.<P></P>And there will not be a repeat of the Fall of Saigon in Baghdad, he says. There are no mechanized divisions advancing on the city.<P>
But there will be an "Iraq Syndrome," he stresses — just as there was a "Vietnam Syndrome" that followed the Vietnam War, a cooling period during which Americans will be loath to endorse the kind of "forceful foreign policy" that leads to expensive and bloody military adventures.<P></P>Prof. John Mueller of Ohio State University agrees. He says the syndrome will take hold "big time." In fact, it's already taking hold.<P></P>"The attitude to North Korea has mellowed, even when they exploded a weapon," he notes. "As for Iran, the idea of (America) doing anything militarily seems to be declining."<P></P>At the Boston conference this year, the similarities between the Iraq and Vietnam wars — and the lessons from the latter — were on everyone's mind.<P></P>Many of the key historical figures attended: Henry Kissinger, Alexander Haig, Walter Cronkite, Kennedy confidante Ted Sorenson, LBJ's former aide Jack Valenti and the war's most famous reporter, David Halberstam.<P></P>Halberstam, whose pinpoint-accurate dispatches from the front as a 28-year-old reporter for <i>The</i> <i>New York Times </i>infuriated the Kennedy White House, vigorously warned of what he called, "The Lying Machine."<P></P>"Washington had created — and it is something that we have to deal with any time we talk about Vietnam ... a <i>great </i>lying machine.<P></P>"And what is a lying machine?" said Halberstam, tall and muscular at 72. "A lying machine exists on a major issue when an administration has a policy that does not, for historic reasons, work out, but where the administration believes it is important to continue it — for a variety of domestic political reasons — and to pretend that it works. So it forces its employees at the top to be disingenuous and punishes those government employees who dare to tell the truth ...."<P></P>Critics of the Iraq war have long claimed the Bush administration has been nothing if not disingenuous and that the war itself was launched on a lie: that Saddam had weapons of mass destruction.<P></P>And those who dared to tell the truth were indeed punished: former ambassador Joseph Wilson was smeared, his CIA agent-wife Valerie Plame was outed, National Security Council adviser Richard Clarke was discredited and four-star Gen. Eric Shinseki — who warned that a real army of "several hundred thousand" U.S. troops would be required to defeat and stabilize Iraq — was ridiculed.<P></P>Sometimes, the lying comes directly from on high. Vice-President Dick Cheney once famously assured the American public that the Iraqi insurgency was "in its last throes." Since then, more than 1,000 American soldiers have died.<P></P>Former LBJ special assistant Valenti also saw clear connections between the wars — ones that, on reflection, might even apply to Canada's involvement in Afghanistan.<P></P>The primary thing Valenti learned during Vietnam was as simple as it was crucial: "You cannot fight a war without public support.<P></P>"The second thing is, you cannot, no matter what mighty army you have, conquer a foreign land, you cannot win against an insurgency that springs from the population with their traditions and their religion and their culture. It has never been done in history, in Afghanistan, in Dien Bien Phu (France's defeat in Vietnam) or in the American colonies — you name it. There has never been an insurgency that didn't prevail against a mighty power.<P></P>"The third thing I learned was that if you're going to fight an enemy, you've got to know who they are. You've got to know their ancestral rhythms and their traditions, their mores, their customs."<P></P>The Bush administration no longer enjoys a majority of public support for the Iraq war; it has not — and likely will not — prevail against an ever-mounting insurgency; and it has demonstrated little respect, let alone knowledge of, Iraqi customs — especially when it comes to religion.<P></P>Most troubling of all, perhaps, was Valenti's revelation that "60 to 70 per cent" of all Pentagon estimates and forecasts during the Vietnam War "turned out to be wrong."<P></P>Can America safely withdraw its 150,000 troops when the time comes? A resolute and unapologetic Henry Kissinger found his own task of removing 500,000 "a very complicated" affair.<P></P>"How <i>do </i>you extricate 500,000 troops technically ... surrounded by a million North Vietnamese and a million South Vietnamese who could turn on you if you suddenly pulled the plug?"<P></P>For modern-day American decision-makers pondering the coming logistical challenge, analyst David Rieff, writing in last week's <i>The New Republic</i>, paraphrased what is said to have been Chicago Mayor Richard Daley's candid advice to LBJ in 1968.<P></P>"It is time to put the f---ing troops on the f---ing planes. Now!"
