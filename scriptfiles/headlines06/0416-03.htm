<p>WASHINGTON -- Scientists doing climate research for the federal government say the Bush 
administration has made it hard for them to speak forthrightly to the public 
about global warming. The result, the researchers say, is a danger that 
Americans are not getting the full story on how the climate is changing. 
<P>Employees and contractors working for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration, along with a U.S. Geological Survey scientist working at an 
NOAA lab, said in interviews that over the past year administration officials 
have chastised them for speaking on policy questions; removed references to 
global warming from their reports, news releases and conference Web sites; 
investigated news leaks; and sometimes urged them to stop speaking to the media 
altogether. Their accounts indicate that the ideological battle over 
climate-change research, which first came to light at NASA, is being fought in 
other federal science agencies as well. 
<P>These scientists  --  working nationwide in research centers in such 
places as Princeton, N.J., and Boulder, Colo.  --  say they are required to 
clear all media requests with administration officials, something they did not 
have to do until the summer of 2004. Before then, climate researchers  --  
unlike staff members in the Justice or State departments, which have 
long-standing policies restricting access to reporters  --  were relatively 
free to discuss their findings without strict agency oversight. 
<P>"There has been a change in how we're expected to interact with the 
press," said Pieter Tans, who measures greenhouse gases linked to global 
warming and has worked at NOAA's Earth System Research Laboratory in Boulder 
for two decades. He said that although he often "ignores the rules" the 
administration has instituted, when it comes to his colleagues, "some people 
feel intimidated  --  I see that." 
<P>Christopher Milly, a hydrologist at the U.S. Geological Survey, said he 
had problems twice while drafting news releases on scientific papers describing 
how climate change would affect the nation's water supply. 
<P>Once in 2002, Milly said, Interior officials declined to issue a news 
release on grounds that it would cause "great problems with the department." In 
November 2005, they agreed to issue a release on a different climate-related 
paper, Milly said, but "purged key words from the releases, including 'global 
warming,' 'warming climate' and 'climate change.' '' 

<P>Administration officials said they are following long-standing policies 
that were not enforced in the past. Kent Laborde, a NOAA public affairs officer 
who flew to Boulder last month to monitor an interview Tans did with a film 
crew from the BBC, said he was helping facilitate meetings between scientists 
and journalists. 
<P>"We've always had the policy, it just hasn't been enforced," Laborde said. 
"It's important that the leadership knows something is coming out in the media, 
because it has a huge impact. The leadership needs to know the tenor or the 
tone of what we expect to be printed or broadcast." 
<P>Several times, however, agency officials have tried to alter what these 
scientists tell the media. When Tans was helping to organize the Seventh 
International Carbon Dioxide Conference near Boulder last fall, his lab 
director told him participants could not use the term "climate change" in 
conference paper's titles and abstracts. Tans and others disregarded that 
advice. 
<P>None of the scientists said political appointees had influenced their 
research on climate change or disciplined them for questioning the 
administration. Several researchers have received bigger budgets in recent 
years because President Bush has focused on studying global warming rather than 
curbing greenhouse gases. NOAA's budget for climate research and services is 
now $250 million, up from $241 million in 2004. 
<P>The assertion that climate scientists are being censored first surfaced in 
January when James Hansen, who directs NASA's Goddard Institute for Space 
Studies, told the New York Times and the Washington Post that the 
administration sought to muzzle him after he gave a lecture in December calling 
for cuts in emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. (NASA 
Administrator Michael Griffin issued new rules recently that make clear that 
its scientists are free to talk to members of the media about their scientific 
findings, including personal interpretations.) 
<P>Two weeks later, Hansen suggested to an audience at the New School 
University in New York that his counterparts at NOAA were experiencing even 
more severe censorship. "It seems more like Nazi Germany or the Soviet Union 
than the United States," he told the crowd. 
<P>NOAA Administrator Conrad Lautenbacher responded by sending an agency-wide 
e-mail that said he is "a strong believer in open, peer-reviewed science as 
well as the right and duty of scientists to seek the truth and to provide the 
best scientific advice possible." 
<P>"I encourage our scientists to speak freely and openly," he added. "We ask 
only that you specify when you are communicating personal views and when you 
are characterizing your work as part of your specific contribution to NOAA's 
mission." 
<P>NOAA scientists, however, cite repeated instances in which the 
administration played down the threat of climate change in their documents and 
news releases. Although Bush and his top advisers have said that Earth is 
warming and human activity has contributed to this, they have questioned some 
predictions and caution that mandatory limits on carbon dioxide could damage 
the nation's economy. 
<P>In 2002, NOAA agreed to draft a report with Australian researchers aimed 
at helping reef managers deal with widespread coral bleaching that stems from 
higher sea temperatures. A March 2004 draft report had several references to 
global warming, including "Mass bleaching ... affects reefs at regional to 
global scales, and has incontrovertibly linked to increases in sea temperature 
associated with global change." 
<P>A later version, dated July 2005, drops those references and several 
others mentioning climate change. 
<P>NOAA has yet to release the coral bleaching report. James Mahoney, 
assistant secretary of commerce for oceans and atmosphere, said he decided in 
late 2004 to delay the report because "its scientific basis was so inadequate." 
Now that it is revised, he said, he is waiting for the Australian Great Barrier 
Reef Marine Park Authority to approve it. "I just did not think it was ready 
for prime time," Mahoney said. "It was not just about climate change  --  there 
were a lot of things." 
<P>On other occasions, Mahoney and other NOAA officials have told researchers 
not to give their opinions on policy matters. Konrad Steffen directs the 
Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences at the University 
of Colorado at Boulder, a joint NOAA-university institute with a $40 million 
annual budget. Steffen studies the Greenland ice sheet, and when his work was 
cited last spring in a major international report on climate change in the 
Arctic, he and another NOAA lab director from Alaska received a call from 
Mahoney in which he told them not to give reporters their opinions on global 
warming. 
<P>Steffen said that he told him that although Mahoney has considerable 
leverage as "the person in command for all research money in NOAA ... I was not 
backing down." 
<P>Mahoney said he had "no recollection" of the conversation, which took 
place in a conference call. "It's virtually inconceivable that I would have 
called him about this," Mahoney said, though he added: "For those who are 
government employees, our position is they should not typically render a policy 
view." 
<P>The need for clearance from Washington, several NOAA scientists said, 
amounts to a "pocket veto" allowing administration officials to block 
interviews by not giving permission in time for journalists' deadlines. 
<P>Ronald Stouffer, a climate research scientist at NOAA's Geophysical Fluid 
Dynamics Laboratory in Princeton, estimated his media requests have dropped in 
half because it took so long to get clearance to talk from NOAA headquarters. 
Thomas Delworth, one of Stouffer's colleagues, said the policy means Americans 
have only "a partial sense" of what government scientists have learned about 
climate change. 

<P>"American taxpayers are paying the bill, and they have a right to know 
what we're doing," he said.</p>
