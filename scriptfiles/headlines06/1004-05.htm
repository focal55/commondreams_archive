the destruction of deep sea ecosystems by banning fishermen
from trawling nets on the ocean floor, Australia, New Zealand
and Palau, joined by actress Sigourney Weaver, said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The 192-member United Nations General Assembly is due to
begin debating this week an Australian-led plan to ban deep sea
bottom trawling in unmanaged high seas and impose tougher
regulation of other destructive fishing practices.</p>
<p>The White House announced on Tuesday that it would support
a ban on deep sea trawling, while the European Commission --
executive of the 25-member European Union -- declared its
backing for the proposal last week.</p>
<p>U.N. General Assembly resolutions are non-binding, but they
reflect the will of the international community.</p>
<p>About 64 percent of the world's ocean is in international
waters, of which about three-quarters is unmanaged, according
to the Pew Institute for Ocean Science.</p>
<p>"The world's oceans are facing a crisis," Weaver told a
news conference, adding that deep sea bottom trawling was
"raping these oceans beyond site and beyond regulation."</p>
<p>"I have come here to join everybody in appealing to all of
those involved to do the right thing for the seas and for
future generations, both human and aquatic, who will thrive on
the bounty of the oceans if given half a chance," said Weaver,
star of the movies "Alien" and "Ghostbusters."</p>
<p>'TRAGIC AND UNPRECEDENTED LOSS OF LIFE'</p>
<p>As mainstay species like cod and hake become depleted by
overfishing, deepwater species with names such as forkbeard,
orange roughy, black scabbardfish and roundnose grenadier are
an attractive catch as trawlers move to new fishing grounds.</p>

<p>A bottom trawl is a cone-shaped net that is towed by one or
two boats across the sea floor, as much as 1400 meters (4,600
feet) below the surface, its pointed end retaining all the fish
that are scooped up.</p>
<p>It can cause damage to extremely slow growing ecosystems,
particularly coral reefs, and also depletes other marine life
that is captured by the nets.</p>
<p>"The global picture in relation to conservation of the
marine environment is a dismal one," Australia's Ambassador to
the United Nations, Robert Hill, said.</p>
<p>The organisms that live in the benthic regions -- on the
bottom of the sea -- can survive without light and tolerate low
temperatures. The World Conservation Union said between 500,000
and 100 million species are thought to inhabit these areas.</p>
<p>A Greenpeace report in March said that 40 percent of the
world's oceans should be placed in nature reserves. Just 0.6
percent of oceans are protected reserves at present, compared
with 12 percent of the world's land, according to U.N. data.</p>
<p>"We do know very little about the deep sea, but what we do
know suggests that it is the largest, most biologically rich
place on this earth," Ellen Pikitch, executive director of the
Pew Institute for Ocean Science said.</p>
<p>"If the United Nations does not take action now, I believe
we will see a tragic and unprecedented loss of life before we
even have the chance to see it, to know it, to describe it."
