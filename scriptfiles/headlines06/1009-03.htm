<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p> Today is a bleak day for the environment, the day of the year when mankind over-exploits the world's resources - the day when we start living beyond our ecological means. </p>

        
          
          
            <p>
  Evidence is mounting that rapid population growth and rising living 
  standards among the Earth's six billion inhabitants are putting an 
  intolerable strain on nature. For the first time an organisation &shy; a British 
  think-tank &shy; has sought to pinpoint how quickly man is using the global 
  resources of farming land, forests, fish, air and energy.
</p>
<p>
  The new economics foundation has calculated from research by a US academic 
  group, Global Footprint Network, that the day when we use more than our fair 
  share of the Earth &shy; when "humanity starts eating the planet" 
  &shy; is October 9. 

</p>
<p>
  In other words, assuming that the world has a certain quantity of natural 
  resources that can sustainably be used up each year, today is the date at 
  which this annual capacity is reached. And environmentalists warn that just 
  as a company bound for bankruptcy plunging into the red or a borrower "
  maxing out" on credit cards must face the consequences, so must man.
</p>
<p>
  The biggest problem relating to the over-consumption of resources is climate 
  change, but its other effects include deforestation, falling agricultural 
  yields and overfishing.
</p>
<p>
  Overfishing is one of the most easily understood examples of the abuse of 
  nature. Catching too many fish has left species that were once common, such 
  as cod in the North Sea and bluefin tuna in the Mediterranean, struggling to 
  survive. 
</p>
<p>
  Although it is possible to make ever-increasing catches for a while, 
  eventually only small, juvenile fish are left, and stocks become unviable. 
  Similarly, emissions of greenhouse gases are rising, exacerbated by the 
  growth of China and India, but the climate is poised to wreak its revenge. 
  Already polar ice caps are melting at a rate that is startling scientists, 
  and examples of extreme weather, such as Hurricane Katrina, which devastated 
  New Orleans in August last year, are being attributed to global climate 
  change. In February, when he was Defence Secretary, John Reid revealed that 
  British military planners were already preparing for conflicts arising from 
  the scramble for resources in 20 to 30 years' time. 
</p>

<p>
  Outlining the impact of global warming, he said: "Impacts such as 
  flooding, melting permafrost and desertification could lead to loss of 
  agricultural land, poisoning of water supplies and destruction of economic 
  infrastructure."
</p>
<p>
  Global Footprint estimates that the human race is over-using the Earth's 
  resources by 23 per cent. While each individual should use up no more than 
  the equivalent of 1.8 hectares of the Earth's surface, the actual area we 
  use is 2.2 hectares per person.
</p>
<p>
  Mathis Wackernagel, executive director of Global Footprint Network, which 
  analyses 6,000 pieces of data from such sources as the United Nations, 
  warned that the limit of the Earth's endurance had already been reached.
</p>
<p>
  He said: "Humanity is living off its ecological credit card and can 
  only do this by liquidating the planet's natural resources."
</p>
<p>

  According to nef's analysis, the unsustainability of human behaviour has 
  speeded up markedly. Humanity started living beyond its means on a global 
  level in 1987, when the limit of sustainability was reached on 19 December. 
  By 1995, the day was arriving by 21 November and began arriving in October 
  shortly after the millennium.
</p>
<p>
  Consumption is particularly profligate in the West, where individuals 
  consume air-freighted food, buy hardwood furniture, enjoy foreign holidays 
  and own cars. Global Footprint estimates the world would need five planet 
  Earths to sustain a global materialistic society such as that in the US 
  while almost three would be needed for the UK. 
</p>
<p>
  By contrast, developing countries such as Kenya use a fraction of the 
  resources. Nef highlighted the energy wasted in trade. In 2004, for example, 
  Britain exported 1,500 tons of potatoes to Germany and imported the same 
  amount. We sent 10,200 tons of milk and cream to France and imported 9,900 
  tons. 
</p>
<p>
  Andrew Simms, policy director of nef, warned the world was living far beyond 
  our environmental means.
</p>
<p>
  Professor Tim Jackson, head of sustainable development at Surrey University, 
  one of Britain's leading experts in sustainability, said the research was 
  broadly right and that we are using resources faster than they can be 
  replaced by the planet.

</p>
<p>
  He said: "We are clearly drawing natural capital and the point about 
  collapse is that we don't know when some of the systems in the global 
  atmosphere and fish will collapse but we do know that collapse is a very 
  real possibility."
</p>
<p>
   <b>Our dwindling natural assets </b>
</p>
<p>
   <b>Fisheries </b>
</p>
<p>
  Degradation of the marine ecosystem is one of the world's biggest problems 
  after climate change. Many fish population have shrunk by 90 per cent in 50 
  years. Species in particular danger are bluefin tuna in the Mediterranean 
  and Atlantic and cod in the North Sea.

</p>
<p>
   <b>Energy </b>
</p>
<p>
  Oil reserves are fast running out: "peak oil" - the point from 
  which oil reserves start to decline - is imminent, with world consumption of 
  oil at 84 million barrels a day. In turn, the burning of fossil fuels is the 
  largest source of emissions of CO2.
</p>
<p>
  Some 13 million hectares of forest are lost every year, says the UN Food and 
  Agriculture Organisation. Almost 20 per cent of The Amazon - the world's "
lung" - has been felled. In 2004 the rate of forest clearance in the 
  Amazon was the second highest on record, caused by the boom in growing soya 
  beans. Deforestation of tropical rainforests may account for the loss of as 
  many as 100 species a day.
</p>
<p>
   <b>Water </b>

</p>
<p>
  Population growth, pollution and climate change are making water a scarce 
  resource. Only 2 per cent of water on Earth is fresh, the rest is salt or 
  trapped in glaciers and snow. By 2050, 7 billion people in 60 countries 
  could be short of drinking water.
</p>
<p>
   <b>Farming land </b>
</p>
<p>
  Overfarming drains the soil of nutrients, while the chemicals used in the 
  process pollute waterways. Farming uses 70 per cent of the world's water 
  supply: to provide 2,700 calories a day requires 4,300 litres (more than 
  seven bathtubs) of water.
