        If these were normal times, the American view of the conflict in Lebanon might look something like the street scenes that have electrified the suburbs of Detroit for the past four weeks. 
<p>
  In Dearborn, home to the Ford Motor Company and also the highest 
  concentration of Arab Americans in the country, up to 1000 people have 
  turned out day after day to express their outrage at the Israeli military 
  campaign and mourn the loss of civilian life in Lebanon. At one protest in 
  late July, 15,000 people - almost half of the local Arab American population 
  - showed up in a sea of Lebanese flags, along with anti-Israeli and 
  anti-Bush slogans.
</p>
<p>
  A few miles to the north, in the heavily Jewish suburb of Southfield, 
  meanwhile, the Congregation Shaarey Zedek synagogue has played host to 
  passionate counter-protests in which the US and Israeli national anthems are 
  played back to back and demonstrators have asserted that it is Israel's 
  survival, not Lebanon's, that is at stake here.
</p>
<p>
  Such is the normal exercise of free speech in an open society, one might 
  think. But these are not normal times. The Detroit protests have been tinged 
  with paranoia and justifiable fear on both sides. Several Jewish 
  institutions in the area, including two community centres and several 
  synagogues, have hired private security guards in response to an incident in 
  Seattle at the end of July, in which a mentally unstable 30-year-old Muslim 
  walked into a Jewish Federation building and opened fire, killing one person 
  and injuring five others.

</p>
<p>
  On the Arab American side, many have expressed reluctance to stand up and be 
  counted among the protesters for fear of being tinged by association with 
  Hizbollah, which is on the United States' list of terrorist organisations. 
  (As a result, the voices heard during the protests tend to be the more 
  extreme ones.) They don't like to discuss their political views in any 
  public forum, following the revelation a few months ago that the National 
  Security Agency was wiretapping phone calls and e-mail exchanges as part of 
  the Bush administration's war on terror.
</p>
<p>
  They are even afraid to donate money to help the civilian victims of the war 
  in Lebanon because of the intense scrutiny Islamic and Arab charities have 
  been subjected to since the 9/11 attacks. The Bush administration has 
  denounced 40 charities worldwide as financiers of terrorism, and arrested 
  and deported dozens of people associated with them. Consequently, while 
  Jewish charities such as the United Jewish Communities are busy raising 
  $300m to help families affected by the Katyusha rockets raining down on 
  northern Israel, donations to the Lebanese victims have come in at no more 
  than a trickle.
</p>
<p>
  Outside Detroit and a handful of other cities with sizeable Arab American 
  populations, it is hard to detect that there are two sides to the conflict 
  at all. The Dearborn protests have received almost no attention nationally, 
  and when they have it has usually been to denounce the participants as 
  extremists and apologists for terrorism - either because they have voiced 
  support for Hizbollah or because they have carried banners in which the Star 
  of David at the centre of the Israeli flag has been replaced by a swastika.
</p>
<p>
  The media, more generally, has left little doubt in the minds of a majority 
  of American news consumers that the Israelis are the good guys, the 
  aggrieved victims, while Hizbollah is an incarnation of the same evil 
  responsible for bringing down the World Trade Centre, a heartless and 
  faceless organisation whose destruction is so important it can justify all 
  the damage Israel is inflicting on Lebanon and its civilians.
</p>

<p>
  The point is not that this viewpoint is necessarily wrong. The point - and 
  this is what distinguishes the US from every other Western country in its 
  attitude to the conflict - is that it is presented as a foregone conclusion. 
  Not only is there next to no debate, but debate itself is considered 
  unnecessary and suspect.
</p>
<p>
  The 24-hour cable news stations are the worst offenders. Rupert Murdoch's 
  Fox News has had reporters running around northern Israel chronicling every 
  rocket attack and every Israeli mobilisation, but has shown little or no 
  interest in anything happening on the other side of the border. It is a 
  rarity on any of the cable channels to see any Arab being tapped for expert 
  opinion on the conflict. A startling amount of airtime, meanwhile, is given 
  to the likes of Michael D Evans, an end-of-the-world Biblical "prophet"
 with no credentials in the complexities of Middle Eastern politics. He has 
  shown up on MSNBC and Fox under the label "Middle East analyst". 
  Fox's default analyst, on this and many other issues, has been the 
  right-wing provocateur and best-selling author Ann Coulter, whose main 
  credential is to have opined, days after 9/11, that what America should do 
  to the Middle East is "invade their countries, kill their leaders and 
  convert them to Christianity".
</p>
<p>
  Often, the coverage has been hysterical and distasteful. In the days 
  following the Israeli bombing of Qana, several pro-Israeli bloggers started 
  spreading a hoax story that Hizbollah had engineered the event, or 
  stage-managed it by placing dead babies in the rubble for the purpose of 
  misleading reporters. Oliver North, the Reagan-era orchestrator of the 
  Iran-Contra affair who is now a right-wing television and radio host, and 
  Michelle Malkin, a sharp-tongued Bush administration cheerleader who runs 
  her own weblog, appeared on Fox News to give credence to the hoax - before 
  the Israeli army came forward to take responsibility and brought the matter 
  to at least a partial close.
</p>
<p>
  As the conflict has gone on, the media interpretation of it has only 
  hardened. Essentially, the line touted by cable news hosts and their 
  correspondents - closely adhering to the line adopted by the Bush 
  administration and its neoconservative supporters - is that Hizbollah is 
  part of a giant anti-Israeli and anti-American terror network that also 
  includes Hamas, al-Qa'ida, the governments of Syria and Iran, and the 
  insurgents in Iraq. Little effort is made to distinguish between these 
  groups, or explain what their goals might be. The conflict is presented as a 
  straight fight between good and evil, in which US interests and Israeli 
  interests intersect almost completely. Anyone who suggests otherwise is 
  likely to be pounced on and ripped to shreds.
</p>
<p>

  When John Dingell, a Democratic congressman from Michigan with a large Arab 
  American population in his constituency, gave an interview suggesting it was 
  wrong for the US to take sides instead of pushing for an end to violence, he 
  was quickly - and loudly - accused of being a Hizbollah apologist. Newt 
  Gingrich, the Republican former House speaker, accused him of failing to 
  draw any moral distinction between Hizbollah and Israel. Rush Limbaugh, the 
  popular conservative talk-show host, piled into him, as did the conservative 
  newspaper The Washington Times. The Times was later forced to admit it had 
  quoted Dingell out of context and reprinted his full words, including: "
  I condemn Hizbollah, as does everyone else, for the violence."
</p>
<p>
  The hysteria has extended into the realm of domestic politics, especially 
  since this is a congressional election year. Republican have sought to 
  depict last week's primary defeat of the Democratic Senator Joe Lieberman of 
  Connecticut, one of the loudest cheerleaders for the Iraq war, as some sort 
  of wacko extremist anti-Semitic, anti-Israeli stand that risks undermining 
  national security. Vice-President Dick Cheney said Lieberman's defeat would 
  encourage "al-Qa'ida types" to think they can break the will of 
  Americans. The fact that the man who beat Lieberman, Ned Lamont, is an 
  old-fashioned East Coast Wasp who was a registered Republican for much of 
  his life is something Mr Cheney chose to overlook.
</p>
<p>
  Part of the Republican strategy this year is to attack any media that either 
  attacks them or has the temerity to report facts that contradict the 
  official party line. Thus, when Reuters was forced to withdraw a photograph 
  of Beirut under bombardment because one of its stringers had doctored the 
  image to increase the black smoke, it was a chance to rip into the news 
  agency over its efforts to be even-handed. In a typical riposte, Michelle 
  Malkin denounced Reuters as "a news service that seems to have made its 
  mark rubber-stamping pro-Hizbollah propaganda".
</p>
<p>
  She was not the only one to take that view. Mainstream, even liberal, 
  publications have echoed her line. Tim Rutten, the Los Angeles Times liberal 
  media critic, denounced the "obscenely anti-Israeli tenor of most of 
  the European and world press" in his most recent column.
</p>
<p>
  It is not just the US media which tilts in a pro-Israeli direction. 
  Congress, too, is remarkably unified in its support for the Israeli 
  government, and politicians more generally understand that to criticise 
  Israel is to risk jeopardising their future careers. When Antonio 
  Villaraigosa, the up-and-coming Democratic Mayor of Los Angeles, was first 
  invited to comment on the Middle East crisis, he sounded a note so 
  pro-Israeli that he was forced to apologise to local Muslim and Arab 
  community leaders. There is far less public debate of Israeli policy in the 
  US, in fact, than there is in Israel itself.

</p>
<p>
  This is less a reflection of American Jewish opinion - which is more diverse 
  than is suggested in the media - than it is a commentary on the power of 
  pro-Israeli lobby groups like Aipac, the American Israel Public Affairs 
  Committee, which bankrolls pro-Israeli congressional candidates. That, in 
  turn, is frustrating to liberal Jews like Michael Lerner, a San Francisco 
  rabbi who heads an anti-war community called Tikkun. Rabbi Lerner has tried 
  to argue for years that it is in Israel's best interests to reach a peaceful 
  settlement, and that demonising Arabs as terrorists is counter-productive 
  and against Judaism.
</p>
<p>
  Lerner is probably right to assert that he speaks for a large number of 
  American Jews, only half of whom are affiliated with pro-Israeli lobbying 
  organisations. Certainly, dinner party conversation in heavily Jewish cities 
  like New York suggest misgivings about Israel's strategic aims, even if 
  there is some consensus that Hizbollah cannot be allowed to strike with 
  impunity.
</p>
<p>
  Few, if any, of those misgivings have entered the US media. "There is 
  no major figure in American political life who has been willing to raise the 
  issue of the legitimate needs of the Palestinian people, or even talk about 
  them as human beings," Lerner said. "The organised Jewish 
  community has transformed the image of Judaism into a cheering squad for the 
  Israeli government, whatever its policies are. That is just idolatry, and 
  goes against all the warnings in the Bible about giving too much power to 
  the king or the state."
