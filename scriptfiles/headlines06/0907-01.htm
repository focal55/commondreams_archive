<p>Public opinion in Europe and the US is converging against President George W. Bush, according to a new transatlantic survey released on Wednesday.
<p>While 77 per cent of EU citizens disapprove of Mr Bush’s handling of international affairs, the figure in the US is now 58 per cent, according to the annual Transatlantic Trends poll of 13,000 people in 12 European nations and the US.</p><p>This is the first time in the five-year history of the poll that more Americans disapprove than approve of Mr Bush’s international stance. During that time, European disapproval of the US has risen by more than 20 percentage points, while the proportion of Europeans who favour US leadership of world affairs has fallen from 64 to 37 per cent.</p><p>“Every single US official says the transatlantic relationship has improved, but Europeans have made their mind up on Bush,” said Ron Asmus, of the German Marshall Fund, which carried out the survey together with the Compagnia di San Paolo, an Italian non-profit organisation. “But Americans and Europeans do not have a fundamental difference on threats and there you have a basis for co-operation.”</p><p>However, the poll did reveal a widening gap with Turkey, where support for joining the European Union has fallen from 73 per cent in 2004 to 54 per cent this year. In that time, positive feelings towards the EU among Turks have fallen from 52 to 45 per cent, while their positive feelings towards Iran have risen from 34 to 43 per cent. The poll, which included responses from nine EU countries and from Turkey, Romania and Bulgaria, said that 94 per cent of Americans and 87 per cent of Europeans believed that a nuclear-armed Iran would be an important threat. </p><p>It adds that 37 per cent of respondents in EU countries and Romania and Bulgaria and 45 per cent of Americans believe that military action should be used to prevent Tehran from acquiring nuclear weapons if all other options fail. Only 10 per cent of Turkish respondents support such a course of action, while 56 per cent said they would accept a nuclear-armed Iran.
