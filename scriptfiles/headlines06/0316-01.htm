SYDNEY - To Australian protesters'
 cries of &quot;war criminal&quot; and &quot;murderer&quot;, U.S. Secretary of State
 Condoleezza Rice defended her government's role in Iraq on
 Thursday and said patience and sacrifice were needed to finish
 the job.

 Speaking to students at the University of Sydney's
 Conservatorium of Music, Rice said she understood why people
 found it hard to be positive about Iraq when all they saw on
 their television screens was violence.<p></p> &quot;I am confident that the Iraqis will triumph, that we will
 win in Iraq but we must be patient with these people,&quot; said
 Rice, who repeatedly thanked Australia for being among the
 first allies to send troops to Iraq.<p></p> There has been a new wave of sectarian killings in Iraq
 since the February 22 bombing of a major Shi'ite shrine,
 raising concern the country is edging closer to civil war.<p></p> Soon after Rice began her speech, two protesters were
 removed from the room after shouting &quot;Condoleezza Rice you are
 a war criminal&quot; and &quot;Iraqi blood is on your hands and you
 cannot wash that blood away&quot;.<p></p> Rice, who is on a three-day trip to Australia, immediately
 shot back she was glad democracy was alive at the university,
 where she said people were free to speak their minds.<p></p> &quot;I am also especially glad to note that democracy will now
 also be alive and well at the University of Kabul and the
 University of Baghdad,&quot; she said.<p></p> About 15 minutes into her address another protester
 interrupted her speech when she referred to freedom. &quot;What kind
 of freedom are you talking about, you are a murderer&quot;, said the
 demonstrator before being led away.<p></p> Several protesters were moved away from outside the
 auditorium before Rice began. Sharp-shooters were positioned on
 on surrounding buildings and security forces looked on from
 boats in Sydney Harbor.<p></p> Australia was among one of the first countries to offer
 troops to help with the U.S. war effort in Iraq and still has
 about 1,300 in and around Iraq, with a promise to stay into
 2007.<p></p> But with support dwindling for the war in Australia, Rice
 sought to justify the U.S. invasion of Iraq in March 2003 and
 said Iraqis were now more free.<p></p> Earlier, at a news conference with Australian Foreign
 Minister Alexander Downer, Rice said it would take several
 years for Iraqis to build a stable and secure Iraq but she was
 confident they would do it.<p></p> &quot;We are going to look one day at a stable and secure Iraq
 and be very grateful to those like Australia and the United
 States who were determined to see the Iraqi people have this
 chance,&quot; she added.<p></p> Rice will visit Australian troops at Victoria Barracks in
 Melbourne on Friday to personally thank them for their help in
 Iraq. She will also lay a wreath at the Shrine of Remembrance.<p></p> One student asked about abuses committed by U.S. forces at
 Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq to which Rice said it had made her
 &quot;sick to her stomach&quot;.<p></p> However, she defended the use of the prison for foreign
 terrorism suspects at the U.S. Naval base in Guantanamo Bay,
 Cuba, where human rights groups say detainees are being held in
 inhumane conditions and their continued detention flouts
 international laws.
