<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->US President George W Bush intends to reveal a new Iraq strategy within days, the BBC has learnt. 
<P>

The speech will reveal a plan to send more US troops to Iraq to focus on ways of bringing greater security, rather than training Iraqi forces.  
<P>
The move comes with figures from Iraqi ministries suggesting that deaths among civilians are at record highs. 
<P>
The US president arrived back in Washington on Monday after a week-long holiday at his ranch in Texas.
<P>
The BBC was told by a senior administration source that the speech setting out changes in Mr Bush's Iraq policy is likely to come in the middle of next week. 
<P>
Its central theme will be sacrifice. 
<P>
The speech, the BBC has been told, involves increasing troop numbers. 
<P>
The exact mission of the extra troops in Iraq is still under discussion, according to officials, but it is likely to focus on providing security rather than training Iraqi forces. 
<P>
The proposal, if it comes, will be highly controversial. 
<P>

Already one senior Republican senator has called it Alice in Wonderland. 
<P>
The need to find some way of pacifying Iraq has been underlined by statistics revealed by various ministries in the Iraqi government, suggesting that well over 1,000 civilians a month are dying.
