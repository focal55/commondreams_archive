 Rafael Correa a former finance minister who resigned from the government 
  after speaking out against a US-backed trade agreement, had seen support 
  surge through the campaign as he addressed mass rallies wielding a leather 
  belt and promising to "give the lash" to Ecuador's elite. 
</p>
<p>
  After years of government collapses Mr Correa had vowed to rewrite the 
  constitution, curb political parties, suspend the free trade deal with 
  Washington and refuse to renew an accord on a US military base used to fight 
  drugs.
</p>
<p>
  But Mr Correa's opponent, the billionaire banana tycoon Alvaro Noboa, gained 
  ground in yesterday's voting, with exit polls last night suggesting that 
  neither side had won a clear victory. A Cedatos Gallup poll showed Mr Noboa 
  with 27.2 per cent of the votes and Mr Correa with 25.4 per cent after first 
  round voting, while another poll showed Mr Noboa with 28.5 per cent of the 
  votes and Mr Correa with 26.5 per cent.
</p>
<p>
  If the polls prove accurate and no candidate has won more than 50 per cent, 
  the presidency will be decided in a run-off next month. Latin America's pink 
  tide had been stemmed in recent months with a narrow defeat for Manuel Lopez 
  Obrador in Mexico and centrist Allan Garcia's win over Ollanta Humala in 
  Peru.

</p>
<p>
  Ecuador's election has been electrified by the looming figure of Mr Chavez, 
  Venezuela's theatrical left-wing President. His barnstorming speech at the 
  United Nations in New York in which he compared President George Bush to 
  Satan and complained of the smell of sulphur on the platform was rapturously 
  received by a growing anti-American movement worldwide. 
</p>
<p>
  Mr Correa was quick to see the appeal of anti-Bush rhetoric with voters in 
  Ecuador and noisily trumpeted his support for Mr Chavez's stand at the UN 
  General Assembly. "Calling Bush the Devil is offending the Devil ... 
  The Devil is evil but the Devil is intelligent," Mr Correa said.
</p>
<p>
  These kinds of comments have struck a chord with an otherwise disillusioned 
  electorate, seemingly enabling him to attract an estimated one-third of 
  voters.
</p>
<p>
  After three presidents were ousted in the last decade, many Ecuadoreans are 
  looking for change. More than half of the 13 million population live in 
  poverty, many of them indigenous communities that still speak Quechua 
  language before Spanish.
</p>

<p>
  An economic crisis in 1999 forced Ecuador to default on its foreign debt and 
  assume the dollar as its currency. Last year civil unrest forced out 
  President Lucio Gutierrez amid claims he had abused his authority.
</p>
<p>
  Although he has a middle-class background, Mr Correa is fluent in Quechua. 
  He also has been involved in educational programmes in poor Amerindian 
  areas, which are expected to give him a strong advantage in a country where 
  45 per cent of the population claim indigenous heritage. A second vote will 
  likely be close. Mr Noboa may draw on support from traditional parties such 
  as the Social Christians, who see Mr Correa as a threat to their influence, 
  but Mr Correa can appeal to voters from all social classes.
</p>
<p>
  "Both are anti-political candidates taking advantage of the discredited 
  political establishment in Ecuador even if they are on different ends of the 
  political spectrum," said Michael Shifter at the Inter-American 
  Dialogue think-tank. 
</p>
<p>
  "Whoever wins in the second round this is not exactly a recipe for 
  stability."
