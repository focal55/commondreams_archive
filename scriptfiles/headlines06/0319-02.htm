        <!--/endimage/--> He said Iraq had not got to the point of no return, but if it fell apart sectarianism would spread abroad.

<p>The UK and US have repeatedly denied Iraq is facing a civil war, but Mr Allawi suggested there was no other way to describe the sectarian violence.

<p>Meanwhile, at least 12 people have been in a series of violent incidents in the north of the country.

<p><b>Cycle of reprisals</b>

<p>Analysts say Mr Allawi's comments are part of political manoeuvring as talks continue over creation of a government.

<p>Speaking to troops in Basra, UK Defence Secretary John Reid insisted that the terrorists were failing to drive Iraq into civil war.

	



<p>There has been a cycle of sectarian reprisals and revenge killings between Sunnis and Shias.

<p>The destruction of the Shia shrine at Samarra on 22 February made some observers wonder if the country was heading towards civil conflict.

<p>The BBC News website's world affairs correspondent Paul Reynolds says the unrest is threatening hopes among the US and its allies for substantial troop withdrawals in the coming months.

<p>In other incidents across the country on Sunday:
<p>
<ul>
<li>US-led Operation Swarmer, against insurgents and foreign fighters near Samarra, is now into its fourth day</li>
<li>Police say that at least eight civilians - including a woman and a child - were killed when US forces opened fire after coming under attack in the town of Dhuluiya, north of Baghdad</li>
<li>Gunmen killed three Iraqi police in the northern town of Mosul</li>
<li>Two bomb attacks killed a policeman and wounded 12 other people in Baquba, north-east of Baghdad</li>
<li>There were reports of a mortar shell exploding in the southern city of Karbala as Shias gathered for one of the biggest events of their religious calendar. No casualties were reported.</li>
</ul> 
<p><b>'Sectarianism will spread'</b>

<p>Mr Allawi heads the Iraqi National List, a secular nationalist alliance made up of Sunnis and Shias.

<p>Speaking on BBC TV's Sunday AM programme, he said it would be a mistake to underplay Iraq's problems, although the country was "edging towards" a political deal.

	
<p>He said he had warned against creating a vacuum in the country and raised concerns about the insurgents and the dismantling of the military.

<p>"It is unfortunate that we are in civil war. We are losing each day as an average 50 to 60 people throughout the country, if not more.

<p>"If this is not civil war, then God knows what civil war is."

<p>Mr Allawi added that a national unity government may not be "an immediate solution" to the country's problems.

<p>Iraq is moving towards the "point of no return", he said, when the country would fragment.

<p>"It will not only fall apart but sectarianism will spread throughout the region, and even Europe and the US will not be spared the violence that results...," he said. </p>
