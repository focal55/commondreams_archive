<p>The Center for Constitutional Rights (CCR), which said it represented all three detainees found dead in their cells Saturday morning, called for an "emergency, independent inspection" of the Guantanamo facility to confirm the cause of their death.</p>
<p>The three were the first inmates to die at the detention center since it opened in early 2003.</p>
<p>A Muslim chaplain and other Muslims assigned to the Guantanamo detention center Tuesday completed funeral prayers over the bodies after washing and shrouding them, said Lieutenant Colonel Lora Tucker, a military spokeswoman.</p>
<p>But officials said no decision has been made yet on what to do with the bodies.</p>
<p>The US military initially said the three -- two Saudis and a Yemeni -- were not represented by outside lawyers, correcting the record only on Monday in court filings, CCR said.</p>
<p>In a news conference Saturday, General Bantz Craddock, head of the US Southern Command, and Rear Admiral Harry Harris, the commander at Guantanamo, would not identify the detainees but said none of them were represented by outside lawyers.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the US Southern Command Tuesday acknowledged that was in error, saying one of the detainees -- Ali Abdullah Ahmed of Yemen -- had a habeas counsel.</p>

<p>Another of the detainees -- Mani Shaman Turki al-Habardi al-Utaybi of Saudi Arabia -- had been previously identified as a habeas petitioner but that was in dispute, said Lieutenant Commander Brad Faban.</p>
<p>He said the other Saudi -- Yassar Talal al-Zahrani -- did not have habeas counsel.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for CCR said Ahmed and Utaybi were represented by the civil rights group and private lawyers.</p>
<p>She said Zahrani also was represented by CCR because he fell under a habeas petition filed on behalf of all prisoners at Guantanamo whose names had not been disclosed by the Department of Defense (DoD).</p>
<p>"This is indicative of the DoD's inability to know who they are or identify them properly," said Gitanjali Gutierrez, a lawyer with CCR.</p>
<p>"Its claims that Guantanamo provides good intelligence is belied by the fact that the DoD doesn't know who is there," she said.</p>
<p>CCR, which represents about 200 detainees at Guantanamo, called the roughly three days it took the military to notify lawyers of their clients' death "an unacceptable delay."</p>
<p>"Furthermore, the administration has thus far refused to provide necessary information to confirm all three detainees' identities to their attorneys, such as photographs or documentation from the base," it said.</p>
<p>It called on the government to allow a group consisting of doctors, CCR attorneys and independent observers to inspect the prison within seven days.</p>

<p>"An internal military investigation without independent doctors and attorneys is an insufficient response to this grave situation," it said.</p>
<p>Earlier, the Pentagon Tuesday rebuffed calls by human rights groups for an outside investigation into the suicides.</p>
<p>"I wouldn't expect that," said Bryan Whitman, a Pentagon spokesman. "The United States is very capable of reviewing its own procedures to determine whether or not any changes need to be made."</p>
<p>He said the incident "will be looked into appropriately."</p>
<p>"If there is one thing the United States military does very well, it is review with a critical eye all its processes and procedures when significant events occur," he said.</p>
