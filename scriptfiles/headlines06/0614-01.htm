        Israel has dismissed continuing calls for an independent international 
  inquiry into the beachfront explosion which killed seven members of a 
  Palestinian family in Gaza last Friday after its own internal military 
  investigation decided it was not responsible for the blast. 
<p>
  As the military investigation team insisted that artillery fire had stopped 
  by the time the explosion occurred and suggested it had been caused by a 
  bomb planted in the sand, Amir Peretz, the Defence Minister, declared: "
  The accumulating evidence proves that this incident was not due to Israeli 
  forces." 
</p>
<p>
  But the official interpretation was strongly challenged by a former Pentagon 
  battle damage expert who has surveyed the scene of the beach explosion. He 
  said yesterday that "all the evidence points" to a 155mm Israeli 
  land-based artillery shell as its cause. 
</p>
<p>

  Marc Garlasco, who worked in war zones including Iraq and Kosovo during his 
  seven-year stint in the US Department of Defence, called for an independent 
  investigation into the killings after concluding that shell fragments and 
  shrapnel from the site, the size and distribution of the craters on the 
  beach, and the type of injuries sustained by the victims made Israeli 
  shelling easily the likeliest cause. 
</p>
<p>
  His assessment came as at least another seven civilians, including two 
  children, as well as two Islamic Jihad militants, were killed in a double 
  Israeli missile strike on a VW van in the densely populated Zeitoun district 
  of Gaza City yesterday. The two children were hit at a nearby house by 
  flying shrapnel and the civilian dead included three medical workers from a 
  nearby children's hospital who rushed to help after hearing the first 
  explosion. 
</p>
<p>
  Israel said the militants had been on their way to launch Katyusha rockets 
  which have a much longer range than the Qassam rockets normally fired from 
  Gaza into Israel. One of the two dead Islamic Jihad militants was Hamoud 
  Wadiya, described as the top rocket launcher in the faction. Mr Peretz said 
  before the strike that Israel was resuming operations "to protect the 
  citizens of Israel" after a pause caused by what he had acknowledged 
  had been "the international storm" over the civilian deaths at the 
  Beit Lahia beach last Friday. 
</p>
<p>
  The debate over the beach explosion is unlikely to die down however. Mr 
  Garlasco who is now the senior military analyst for Human Rights Watch, said 
  yesterday: "Of course I can't be completely conclusive but all the 
  evidence points to its being a 155mm Israeli shell which killed the 
  Palestinians on the beach."
</p>
<p>
  Mr Garlasco said that most of the serious injuries of the victims in the 
  Gaza hospitals that he had visited were to the torsos and heads, which were 
  inconsistent with a land mine or of a bomb embedded in the sand. "If 
  this had been a landmine I would have expected to see serious leg injuries,"
 he said. Mr Garlasco said that while he could not rule out the theoretical 
  possibility that Palestinian militants had rigged up an unexploded 155mm 
  shell to make an explosive device of their own, that too would have normally 
  produced many more severe leg injuries. 

</p>
<p>
  Mr Garlasco produced a four to five-inch, mainly blackened shell fragment 
  which he collected about 100 yards from the scene of the explosion and in 
  which the figures 55 and the letters "mm" are clearly discernible. 
  While acknowledging that this was not itself definite proof that the shell 
  had killed the Palestinians he said some fragments and shrapnel which the 
  Palestinian police explosives department say they took from the scene where 
  the victims were killed were definitely from a 155mm shell. 
</p>
<p>
  Mr Garlasco who accompanied a small group of journalists to the Beit Lahia 
  beach, pointed to three separate craters, each covered in a whitish powder, 
  which he said were fresh, one of which was at the spot where witnesses agree 
  the fatal blast occurred, and the two others separated it from it by about 
  120 and 250 yards. Mr Garlasco added: "It would be a really ridiculous 
  coincidence if there is active shelling and then suddenly an IED [improvised 
  explosive device] goes off." 
</p>
<p>
  The military have admitted firing earlier in the area but now say that the 
  explosion occurred between 4.47 and 5.10pm, when it says firing had stopped. 
  An ambulance driver from the nearby al-Awda hospital, Khaled Abu Sada, said 
  that he first took a call about the emergency at 4.50pm. 
</p>
<p>
  The military did not explicitly repeat claims in earlier leaks that Hamas 
  had planted the device or say whether it was a dud shell. It says that 
  shrapnel taken from the bodies of victims being treated in Israeli hospitals 
  was not from a 150mm shell. But Mr Garlasco said that copper-lined shrapnel 
  taken from two injured girls who had been in a car at the time of the blast 
  and from the car itself were consistent with such a shell fired by a M109 
  howitzer.
</p>

<p>
  Mr Garlasco ruled out the possibility that the shells were naval, as 
  originally thought, on the grounds that they were too large to be fired from 
  Israeli navy coastal vessels.
