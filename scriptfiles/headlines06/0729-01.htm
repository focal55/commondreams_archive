Tony Blair and George Bush defied the growing anger across the world 
  yesterday by seeking a UN resolution that fell far short of a ceasefire to 
  end the killing of Lebanese civilians.
</p>


        
          
          
            <p>
  Speaking after talks at the White House, Mr. Bush announced that on Monday 
  the UN Security Council will discuss the creation of a multinational force 
  to patrol a buffer zone on the southern Lebanon border. Mr. Bush said the US 
  would be tabling a UN Security Council resolution next week to seek an end 
  to hostilities "as soon as possible" but it failed to meet the 
  demands for a ceasefire in an open letter in the <i>Independent </i>yesterday, 
  signed by 42 leading figures in the arts, business, and politics.

Heightening fears that the war in Lebanon is being used as a proxy war 
  between the US and Iran, Mr. Blair said Iran would be mistaken if it thought 
  the war was an opportunity to step up its pursuit of a nuclear weapon. "
  They risk increasing confrontation," he said.
</p>
<p>

  Cabinet ministers warned that Mr. Blair's refusal to stand up to Mr. Bush 
  would hasten his own exit from power. "This whole episode is very 
  damaging for Tony," said one cabinet source. "They can cobble 
  together a resolution but it won't be a solution to the violence. Tony 
  thinks there is an arc of Islamic extremists like the Fascists in the Second 
  World War. But this war is acting as a recruitment sergeant for the 
  extremists." The source was dismissive about Mr. Blair's attempts to 
  influence the President. "The only special relationship the US has is 
  with Israel. This is all driven by internal US politics. I don't know why 
  Tony hasn't told Bush we have internal political pressures too."
</p>
<p>
  Both Mr. Bush and Mr. Blair refused to discuss a ceasefire. Mr. Blair was 
  expected to claim their talks were a breakthrough but their commitment to a 
  peace plan was in danger of being dismissed by their critics as window 
  dressing and hot air last night.
</p>
<p>
  Mr. Bush offered the prospect of reconstruction of the ravaged areas of 
  Lebanon to rehouse the thousands of refugees. But their plans failed to live 
  up to the Downing Street spin operation in advance of their meeting at the 
  White House which suggested there could be a call for a ceasefire next week. 
</p>
<p>
  Mr. Blair said the war was a "complete tragedy" but said it offered 
  an "opportunity" to force Hezbollah to abandon its campaign 
  against Israel. He said he wanted to see "a cessation of hostilities as 
  quickly as possible" but he refused to condemn Israel for the 
  indiscriminate bombing. He said: "The conditions have got to be in 
  place for it to happen. This can only work if Hezbollah are prepared to 
  allow it to work." He claimed the violence was "part of a bigger 
  picture" in the Middle East of reactionary groups trying to stop 
  progress towards democracy. "There should be no doubt at all that it 
  will be a temporary respite unless we put in place the longer-term framework," he said.
</p>
<p>
  Mr. Bush described the conflict as "the calling of the 21st century.&quot; The resolution would set out the framework for a "cessation of 
  hostilities on an urgent basis" and the deployment of the mutlinational 
  force, he said. "Our goal is to achieve a lasting peace that requires 
  the free democratic and independent Lebanese government be in power to 
  exercise full authority over its territory." 

</p>
<p>
  Opening their joint press conference, Mr. Bush made a joking reference to his 
  overheard remarks to the Prime Minister at the G8 conference when a 
  microphone was left on and he said: "Yo Blair." "You share 
  with me your perspective and you let me know when the microphone is on ..."</p>
<p>
  Mr. Blair's aides outlined a proposed agreement that would see a UN 
  stabilization force police a buffer zone within Lebanon's southern border. 
  The UN would also call for the withdrawal of Iranian and Syrian personnel, 
  and the "progressive disarmament" of Hezbollah if the draft 
  resolution is agreed.
</p>
<p>
  But Andrew Murray, chairman of the <a href="http://www.stopwar.org.uk/%20" target="_new">Stop the War Coalition</a>, said: "It is 
  simply hot air. Despite the previous spin we have heard in recent days, 
  their position is exactly the same; they are still endorsing continuing 
  Israeli aggression against Lebanon. There is a huge amount of anger around 
  the country about that."
</p>
<p>
  Mr. Blair's spokesman was dismissive of calls for a ceasefire without an 
  agreement on a new force as "just so much wind.&quot; Instead, said the 
  spokesman, Mr. Blair wants to step up the pace of diplomatic efforts. "
  We want to increase the pace of diplomacy in identifying the steps necessary 
  to bring about a ceasefire on both sides," he said. "I believe 
  what we should be working towards is a resolution as early as possible next 
  week. We believe others are roughly in the same ballpark."
</p>

<p>
  The British-backed draft resolution is designed to enable the Lebanese 
  government to fulfil UN resolution 1559 that calls for the removal of all 
  militias from its border with Israel, he said. "It would give a mandate 
  to a new, UN-backed multinational force." Downing Street does not rule 
  out the possibility that a NATO force could be deployed, so long as it has 
  UN blessing.
</p>
<p>
  A French suggestion that the security zone should straddle the border with 
  Israel was rejected. In return for the withdrawal of Hezbollah from Lebanon 
  and its sponsors, the UN would commit to a renewed attempt to secure the 
  two-state road map to peace. It was clear, however, that many questions 
  about the composition, size, mandate, and timing of deployments are 
  unresolved.
</p>
<p>
  Downing Street again made clear it was unlikely that any peacekeeping force 
  including US or British troops would be deployed, leaving Mr. Blair to urge 
  more speedy action from the sidelines.
</p>
<p>
  The Labour MP Phyllis Starkey &shy; a former Foreign Office aide &shy; said Mr. Blair 
  had a "far too rosy view" of the Israeli tactics. "I believe 
  that the Prime Minister does not take a strong enough line with them in 
  telling them when they are going against international law," she said.

  <b>Blair Apologizes For Preswick Flight</b>
</p>
<p>
  By Ben Russell
</p>
<p>
  * Tony Blair was offered a "one line" apology from President Bush 
  over the United States' use of a British airport as a transit for weapons 
  shipments to Israel.
</p>
<p>
  The Prime Minister's official spokesman said President Bush had limited his 
  apology to the US failure to observe the proper procedures for using 
  Prestwick airport near Glasgow as a stopover for an Israel-bound plane 
  carrying laser-guided bombs. 

</p>
<p>
  "It was just a one line. As part of the introduction, the President 
  said sorry there was a problem," the spokesman said.
</p>
<p>
  Sir Menzies Campbell, the Liberal Democrat leader, said Britain should "say no" to any transfers, after it emerged this week that the US asked 
  for permission for more flights to stop in Britain over the coming weeks. 
  The Foreign Office said permission would be granted if the US observed 
  correct procedures.
