<p>There's a West Point Barber Shop, West Point Pizza and
West Point Florist.
<P> But the U.S. Military Academy at West Point is warning a
Manlius man that his new organization West Point Graduates
Against the War better stop using the words "West
Point" in its name. </P>
<P> Bill Cross, a West Point graduate and Vietnam War veteran,
said he's become accustomed to some military officials
criticizing him for protesting both U.S. wars on Iraq. </P>
<P> But Cross never expected the government to threaten to use
trademark laws to stifle him, he said. </P>
<P> On April 12, just days after <a href="http://www.westpointgradsagainstthewar.org" target="_new">www.westpointgradsagainstthewar.org</a> was launched on the Internet, a West Point lawyer
mailed Cross' organization a letter alleging it is
violating the U.S. Army's trademark. </P>

<P> Academy spokesman Michael D'Aquino said this dispute
is not about politics. </P>
<P> The military academy would have sent Cross'
organization a warning letter even if it was called "West Point Graduates For the War," D'Aquino said. </P>
<P> The U.S. Army registered a trademark on the words
"West Point" in 2000 to prevent anyone else from
using the mark on educational material or a wide range of
commercial goods, including golf balls, commemorative coins,
Christmas tree ornaments and paper products. </P>
<P> "Users must have (the Army's) permission to
incorporate these words in Web sites or organizational
titles," D'Aquino said. </P>
<P> When a trademark violation comes to their attention, Army
officials take action, D'Aquino said. </P>

<P> Cross' organization has hired Syracuse attorney Joseph
Heath to battle back against the academy, located 50 miles
north of New York City. In a letter sent Monday to West
Point, Heath questioned the academy's stance given his
client's First Amendment rights and the widespread use
of the words "West Point." </P>
<P> Cross, a psychology professor at Onondaga Community College
and family therapist, co-founded West Point Graduates with
his 1962 classmates Jim Ryan, of New York City, and Joe
Wojcik, of Claremont, Calif. </P>
<P> He said the organization has a Web site, but no assets, and
it isn't selling anything. The founders plan to
incorporate it as a nonprofit business. West Point
graduates, their spouses and their children can join for
free. </P>
<P> Cross estimated that about 50 people have joined since the
Web site was launched in mid-April. Through Tuesday
afternoon, there had been more than 22,000 hits on the
group's Web site. </P>
<P> As for barbers and florists who use the name for their
businesses, at least three interviewed Thursday said
they've never been contacted by the Army, and were
unaware the name was a trademark. </P>
<P> "I'm 73 years old, I've been here 50 years
and they've never bothered me," said Bill Carlton,
owner of the West Point Barber Shop in West Point, Va.
"As far as I know, anybody who wants to open (a
business) can go ahead and grab (the name)." </P>
