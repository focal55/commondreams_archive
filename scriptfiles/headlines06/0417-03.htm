<p>As members of the US military establishment argue over the
responsibility of the Defence Secretary, Donald Rumsfeld, for the
failures of the Iraq war, it has been suggested that his fate may
lie with his old friend Dick Cheney, the Vice-President.</p>
<p>"The possibility of Rumsfeld leaving has definitely crossed the
President's mind," <i>Time</i> magazine quotes an unnamed former
White House official as saying.</p>

<p>"The key to it is the relationship with Cheney, and I don't know
where that is right now."</p>
<p>Richard Myers, who retired as the chairman of the Joint Chiefs
of Staff six months ago, has defended his former boss, and
implicitly, his own rule as the US's most senior military officer,
against a growing chorus of retired generals who have called for Mr
Rumsfeld's head.</p>
<p>In the past few weeks six retired generals have called for Mr
Rumsfeld's resignation, citing a series of mistakes in the planning
and early execution of the war in Iraq.</p>
<p>Behind the criticism is the implicit acknowledgement that the
war is going badly and progress is not being made, as President
George Bush and the current military leadership maintain.</p>
<p>Wallowing in the opinion polls, it is the last thing Mr Bush
needs, especially as his standard reply to criticism of the conduct
of the war is to say that he is taking the advice of the military
on the ground.</p>
<p>The problems in Iraq are fracturing old conventions about the
relationship between the US military and the civilian leadership,
an extraordinary development during a war. And it has opened a
public split in the military, mirroring the deep divisions in the
country as a whole.</p>
<p>And while no one - especially Mr Bush - has convinced the public
of what the next right step in Iraq is, there is a growing
consensus that the US went wrong right after the invasion: a lack
of troops to enforce law and order, dissolving the Iraqi army and
allowing a nascent insurgency to form.</p>
<p>General Myers denied that he or other officers had been
intimidated by his boss, or felt uncomfortable when confronted with
dissenting views on Iraq, and said that if there were people with
dissenting views who had stayed silent, "shame on them". He said it
was inappropriate for retired officers to speak out when they had
had the opportunity to speak when they were in uniform.</p>
<p>He said the senior officers had given Mr Rumsfeld their best
advice. "If we don't do that, we should be shot."</p>

<p>But he did concede that "some of the senior civilian leadership"
should not have criticised the then army chief-of-staff General
Eric Shinseki, who told Congress shortly before the war began that
much larger troop numbers might be needed and warned of ethnic
conflict in the aftermath.</p>
