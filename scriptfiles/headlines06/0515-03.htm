<p>As the make-believe presidency of The West Wing came to a conclusion, Americans got a taste of another alternative political reality when Al Gore appeared on the comedy show Saturday Night Live to address the nation as "President Gore".<P>Basing his sketch on the premise that he had emerged triumphant, instead of defeated, from the presidential election acrimony in Florida in 2000, Mr Gore appeared in a mocked-up Oval Office and assumed a grave expression.<P>After six years of his presidency, the country faced many problems, he admitted: the gigantic budget surplus was "down to a perilously low $11 trillion", while the US was so popular worldwide "that American tourists can't go to Europe any more without getting hugged".<P>"In the last six years we have been able to stop global warming," said Mr Gore, who in real life is currently publicising a documentary and book on the subject, titled An Inconvenient Truth.<P>"No one could have predicted the negative results of this. Glaciers that once were melting are now on the attack. As you know, these renegade glaciers have already captured parts of upper Michigan and northern Maine, but I assure you: we will not let the glaciers win."<P>Then there was "the worst gas crisis in history" - a reference to the currently soaring price of petrol in the US.<P>"We have way too much gasoline ... I know that I am partly to blame by insisting that cars run on trash," Mr Gore said. His critics seem likely to interpret the skit as a display of bitterness, though the fact that he appeared at all seemed to run counter to the received wisdom in 2000 that he was wooden and lacked humour.<P>Mocking his notorious comments about the internet as Bill Clinton's vice-president in 1999 - he used a form of words that made it sound as if he was claiming to have invented the internet - "President Gore" said a weather disaster in the US was unlikely "because of the anti-hurricane and tornado machine I was instrumental in helping to develop".
