Jimmy Carter, one of four presidents to speak, took a jab
at Bush's domestic eavesdropping program during six hours of
sermons, speeches and song for the late widow of Nobel peace
laureate Martin Luther King Jr., assassinated in 1968.</p>
<p>The 10,000 mourners also heard the Rev. Joseph Lowery, a
civil-rights leader, cite Mrs. King's legacy as a champion of
racial equality while launching barbs at Bush administration
policies on Iraq and health care.</p>
<p>Mrs. King, 78, died on January 30 of complications from
ovarian cancer. Her funeral at a Baptist church in Lithonia,
Georgia, drew a "who's who" of the political and entertainment
worlds and the U.S. civil rights community.</p>
<p>She was due to be buried alongside her husband at the
Martin Luther King Jr. Center for Nonviolent Social Change she
founded in nearby Atlanta.</p>
<p>With Washington debating the legality of Bush's domestic
eavesdropping on Americans suspected of ties to al Qaeda,
Carter drew spirited applause with comments on federal efforts
to spy on the Kings decades ago.</p>
<p>"It was difficult for them personally with the civil
liberties of both husband and wife violated, and they became
the targets of secret government wiretapping and other
surveillance," Carter said.</p>
<p>Former President Bill Clinton, a favorite among mainstream
civil rights leaders, offered a teasing hint of the possible
presidential candidacy of his wife, New York Democratic Sen.
Hillary Rodham Clinton, who stood smiling at his side.</p>
<p>"I'm honored to be here with my president and my former
presidents and ...," he trailed off, motioning in his wife's
direction to loud and sustained applause.</p>

<p>Speaking first, ahead of his critics, Bush said: "I've come
today to offer the sympathy of our entire nation at the passing
of a woman who worked to make our nation whole.</p>
<p>"Having loved a leader she became a leader. And when she
spoke Americans listened closely, because her voice carried the
wisdom and goodness of a life well-lived," he said.</p>
<p>POETRY</p>
<p>Lowery, former head of the Southern Christian Leadership
Conference, which Martin Luther King helped found in 1957, gave
a playful reading of a poem in eulogy of Mrs. King and made a
none-too-veiled reference to the Iraq war launched by Bush.</p>
<p>"We know now there were no weapons of mass destruction over
there / But Coretta knew and we knew that there are weapons of
misdirection right down here / Millions without health
insurance. Poverty abounds. For war billions more but no more
for the poor," Lowery said.</p>
<p>The mourners responded with a standing ovation. Bush's
immediate reaction could not be seen on television, but after
Lowery finished speaking, the president -- who sat behind the
speakers -- shook his hand and laughed.</p>
<p>Bush's father George Bush, the fourth president at the
funeral, broke any tension by recalling his own meetings as
president with Lowery and gave a score: "Lowery 21, Bush 3, it
wasn't a fair fight."</p>
<p>The service, billed as a celebration of Mrs. King's life,
featured performances by Stevie Wonder and Michael Bolton.
Mourners joined a choir in singing some of King's favorite
gospel songs, among them "Amazing Grace."</p>
<p>Mrs. King's daughter Bernice, a minister, gave the eulogy,
saying of her mother: "She was not just a national figure, she
was a global leader."

<p>
Born April 27, 1927, near Marion, Alabama, Coretta Scott
King played a back-up role in the civil rights movement until
her husband, a Baptist minister, was gunned down in Memphis on
April 4, 1968.
<p>
As she recalled in her autobiography "My Life With Martin
Luther King Jr.," she felt she had to step fully into the civil
rights movement. She last appeared in public on the weekend of
the annual holiday last month that honors his legacy.
