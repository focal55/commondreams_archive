<p> The Bush administration is filing secret arguments with a federal judge to 
dismiss <a href="http://www.commondreams.org/headlines06/0512-10.htm">a lawsuit</a> against AT&T over its alleged participation in the 
government's electronic surveillance program, a privacy-rights group said 
Friday.

        <!--/endimage/--> The <a href="http://www.eff.org/" target="_new">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a>, which filed the suit in a San 
Francisco federal court in January, said Justice Department lawyers had 
notified it that the motion to dismiss and accompanying sworn statements were 
being filed under seal. Only an edited version will be made public. 
<P>The administration said last month that it would assert the "military and 
state secrets privilege'' and argue that allowing the case to proceed would 
jeopardize national security. Filing the arguments under seal is common in such 
cases and has been permitted by federal courts. 
<P>"We will be forced to argue against a secret brief that we will never see 
in total,'' said Kevin Bankston, a lawyer with the foundation. 

<P>The suit, filed on behalf of AT&T customers, accuses the company of giving 
the National Security Agency access to its voice and data network and records 
of customers' calls and e-mails without a search warrant or any evidence of 
wrongdoing. The suit seeks an order halting the company's actions and damages 
for all affected customers. 
<P>President Bush has said that shortly after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 
11, 2001, he authorized the National Security Agency to intercept phone calls 
and e-mails between U.S. residents and terror suspects abroad without court 
approval. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 required the 
government to obtain a warrant from a court in secret session for such 
surveillance, but Bush maintains he has the constitutional authority to 
override the law. 
<P>The lawsuit says AT&T has allowed the federal agency to sift 
electronically through all its messages. On Thursday, USA Today reported that 
AT&T, Verizon and Bell South had turned over domestic telephone records to the 
National Security Agency. 
<P>Chief U.S. District Judge Vaughn Walker is scheduled to hear arguments 
Wednesday on AT&T's request to seal documents obtained by a former company 
technician allegedly describing company equipment in San Francisco capable of 
scanning huge amounts of data for use by the federal agency. 
<P>The government's authority to keep military secrets out of court was 
recognized by the Supreme Court in 1953. A 1998 ruling by the Ninth U.S. 
Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco said the potential disclosure of 
secret information may require dismissal of an entire lawsuit. 
<P>"This is the most powerful privilege that the government asserts,'' said 
Gregory Sisk, a law professor at the University of St. Thomas in Minnesota who 
has studied the issue. "The Supreme Court has said that a (judge) must give 
utmost deference to the government.'' 
<P>Bankston, lawyer for the San Francisco privacy-rights group, said, "We 
believe that we could prove our case without revealing any information that 
would harm the national security.''
