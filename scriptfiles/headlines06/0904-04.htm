<p> World leaders need to think about adapting to climate change rather than focusing only on trying to fight it, a leading economist said today. </p>
<p> Frances Cairncross, who chairs the Economic and Social Research Council, dismissed the Kyoto agreement to cut greenhouse gas emissions as "largely ineffectual".</p>
<p>To a large extent, global warming was an inevitable reality the world was going to have to cope with, she told the BA Festival of Science in Norwich.</p>
<p>"Adaptation policies have had far less attention than mitigation, and that is a mistake," she said. ".. We need to think now about policies that prepare for a hotter, drier world, especially in poorer countries. That may involve, for instance, developing new crops, constructing flood defences, setting different building regulations, or banning building close to sea level."</p>

<p>Ms Cairncross was addressing the meeting at the University of East Anglia in her capacity as this year's president of the BA - the British Association for the Advancement of Science.</p>
<p>She pointed out that greenhouse emissions would have to be slashed by 60 per cent to stop levels of global warming gases increasing.</p>
<p>"That's simply not going to happen," she said.</p>
<p>All the known sources of renewable energy combined would only shave 2 per cent off the world's electricity generating requirement, she stressed.</p>
<p>Coal, on the other hand, accounted for 40 per cent of all the electricity generated.</p>
<p>"Even if our electricity from renewables rose tenfold we would still be generating half as much electricity from that source as we do from coal," she added.</p>
<p>India and China, together representing a third of humanity, had not signed up to Kyoto, said Ms Cairncross, who is Rector of Exeter College Oxford. And the United States chose to ignore it.</p>
<p>Some places in the world, such as the Siberian steppes, might actually benefit from global warming, she said.</p>
<p>She told the meeting: "There are two main ways we can respond to climate change: we can adapt, or we can try to slow the process. In practice, we will do both. But adaptation to climate change has had relatively little discussion."</p>

<p>To ensure successful environmental policies, the current generation would have to make sacrifices for its descendants, she said. </p>
