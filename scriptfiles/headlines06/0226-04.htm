<p> A 'praja court' (public court) here Sunday held US President George W. Bush guilty of "perpetrating terrorism in the name of fighting terrorism and killing people including women and children".
<p>Bush, who is scheduled to visit the Andhra Pradesh capital March 3, the last day of his three-day visit to India, faced charges ranging from war mongering and mass killings to violation of all international charters and aggression against sovereign countries.
<p>A jury comprising retired Supreme Court judge B.S.A. Swamy, human rights activist G. Haragopal and prominent writer-activist Rama Milkote heard the people and upheld eight charges against Bush.
<p>The jury held Bush guilty of "perpetrating terrorism in the name of fighting against terrorism" and "attacking and threatening other countries using the issue of nuclear weapons as a pretext".
<p>Bush was also found to be guilty of human rights violations and large- scale killing of people, including women and children, especially in Afghanistan and Iraq and of creating a sense of insecurity in the world.
<p>"It is a fit case to be tried in the international court of justice," said the jury.
<p>The public hearing on "crimes of George Bush" was held by a coalition of 40 groups including Left parties and their affiliated organisations, human rights and women's groups, and trade unions.
<p>This was the first time that such a public hearing was held n the country against any visiting head of state or government.
<p>A total of 13 people deposed before the jury, which asked the Indian government to call off Bush's visit.<p align="center">&copy; Copyright 2001-2006 IANS India Private Limited.</p>
