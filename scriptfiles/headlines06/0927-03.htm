<p>A strong majority of Iraqis want U.S.-led military forces to immediately 
withdraw from the country, saying their swift departure would make Iraq more 
secure and decrease sectarian violence, according to new polls by the State 
Department and independent researchers. 
<P>In Baghdad, for example, nearly three-quarters of residents polled said 
they would feel safer if U.S. and other foreign forces left Iraq, with 65 
percent of those asked favoring an immediate pullout, according to polling 
results obtained by the Washington Post. 
<P>Another new poll, scheduled to be released today by the Program on 
International Policy Attitudes at the University of Maryland, found that 71 
percent of Iraqis questioned want the Iraqi government to ask foreign forces to 
depart within a year. By large margins, though, Iraqis believe the U.S. 
government would refuse the request, with 77 percent of those polled saying the 
United States intends to keep permanent military bases in the country. 
<P>The stark assessments, among the most negative attitudes toward U.S.-led 
forces since they invaded Iraq in 2003, contrast sharply with views expressed 
by the government of Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki. Last week at the United 
Nations, President Jalal Talabani said coalition troops should remain in the 
country until Iraqi security forces are "capable of ending terrorism and 
maintaining stability and security." 
<P>"Only then will it be possible to talk about a timetable for the 
withdrawal of the multinational force from Iraq," he said. 

<P>Recent polls show many Iraqis in nearly every part of the country 
disagree. 
<P>"Majorities in all regions except Kurdish areas state that the 
Multi-National Force-Iraq (MNF-I) should withdraw immediately, adding that the 
MNF-I's departure would make them feel safer and decrease violence," concludes 
the 20-page State Department report, titled "Iraq Civil War Fears Remain High 
in Sunni and Mixed Areas." The report was based on 1,870 face-to-face 
interviews conducted from June 26 to July 6. 
<P>The Program on International Policy Attitudes poll, which was conducted 
over the first three days of September for WorldPublicOpinion.org, found that 
support among Sunnis for a withdrawal of all U.S.-led forces within six months 
dropped to 57 percent in September from 83 percent in January. 
<P>"There is a kind of softening of Sunni attitudes toward the U.S.," said 
Steven Kull, director of the Program on International Policy Attitudes and 
editor of WorldPublicOpinion.org. "But you can't go so far as to say the 
majority of Sunnis don't want the U.S. out. They do. They're just not quite in 
the same hurry as they were before." 
<P>The Program on International Policy Attitudes poll, which has a margin of 
error of 3 percent, was carried out by Iraqis in all 18 provinces who conducted 
interviews with more than 1,000 randomly selected Iraqis in their homes. 
<P>Using complex sampling methods based on data from Iraq's Planning 
Ministry, the pollsters selected streets to conduct interviews. In urban areas, 
they then contacted every third house on the left side of the road. When they 
selected a home, the interviewers then collected the names and birthdates of 
everyone who lived there and polled the person with the most recent birthday. 
<P>Matthew Warshaw, a senior research manager at D3 systems, which helped 
conduct the poll, said he did not think Iraqis were any less likely to share 
their true opinions with pollsters than Americans. "It's a concern you run up 
against in Iowa or in Iraq," he said. 
<P>The State Department report did not give a detailed methodology for its 
poll, which it said was carried out by an unnamed Iraqi polling firm. 
<P>The director of another Iraqi polling firm, who spoke on condition of 
anonymity because he feared being killed, said public opinion surveys he 
conducted last month showed that 80 percent of Iraqis questioned favored an 
immediate withdrawal. 
<P>"The very fact that there is such a low support for American forces has to 
do with the American failure to do basically anything for Iraqis," said Mansoor 
Moaddel, a professor of sociology at Eastern Michigan University.
