<p> George Bush considered provoking a war with Saddam Hussein's regime by 
  flying a United States spyplane over Iraq bearing UN colours, enticing the 
  Iraqis to take a shot at it, according to a leaked memo of a meeting between 
  the US President and Tony Blair.

 The two leaders were worried by the lack of hard evidence that Saddam 
  Hussein had broken UN resolutions, though privately they were convinced that 
  he had. According to the memorandum, Mr Bush said: "The US was thinking 
  of flying U2 reconnaissance aircraft with fighter cover over Iraq, painted 
  in UN colours. If Saddam fired on them, he would be in breach." 
</p>
<p>
  He added: "It was also possible that a defector could be brought out 
  who would give a public presentation about Saddam's WMD, and there was also 
  a small possibility that Saddam would be assassinated." The memo 
  damningly suggests the decision to invade Iraq had already been made when Mr 
  Blair and the US President met in Washington on 31 January 2003 &shy; when the 
  British Government was still working on obtaining a second UN resolution to 
  legitimise the conflict. 

</p>
<p>
  The leaders discussed the prospects for a second resolution, but Mr Bush 
  said: "The US would put its full weight behind efforts to get another 
  resolution and would 'twist arms' and 'even threaten'. But he had to say 
  that if ultimately we failed, military action would follow anyway." He 
  added that he had a date, 10 March, pencilled in for the start of military 
  action. The war actually began on 20 March. 
</p>
<p>
  Mr Blair replied that he was "solidly with the President and ready to 
  do whatever it took to disarm Saddam." But he also insisted that "
  a second Security Council resolution would provide an insurance policy 
  against the unexpected, and international cover, including with the Arabs"
. 
</p>
<p>
  The memo appears to refute claims made in memoirs published by the former UK 
  ambassador to Washington, Sir Christopher Meyer, who has accused Mr Blair of 
  missing an opportunity to win the US over to a strategy based on a second UN 
  resolution. It now appears Mr Bush's mind was already made up. 
</p>
<p>
  There was also a discussion of what might happen in Iraq after Saddam had 
  been overthrown. President Bush said that he "thought it unlikely that 
  there would be internecine warfare between the different religious and 
  ethnic groups". Mr Blair did not respond. Details of the meeting are 
  revealed in a book, Lawless World, published today by Philippe Sands, a 
  professor of law at University College London. 
</p>

<p>
  "I think no one would be surprised at the idea that the use of spy 
  planes to review what is going on would be considered," Mr Sands told 
  Channel 4 News last night. "What is surprising is the idea that they 
  would be painted in the colours of the United Nations to provoke an attack 
  which could then be used to justify material breach. 
</p>
<p>
  "Now that plainly looks as if it is deception, and it raises... 
  questions of legality, both in terms of domestic law and international law."</p>
<p>
  Other participants in the meeting were Mr Bush's National Security Adviser, 
  Condoleezza Rice, her deputy, Dan Fried, the chief of staff, Andrew Card, Mr 
  Blair's then security adviser, Sir David Manning, his foreign policy aide, 
  Matthew Rycroft, and his chief of staff, Jonathan Powell. 
</p>
<p>
  The Downing Street spokesman later said: "The Prime Minister only 
  committed forces to Iraq after securing the approval of the Commons in the 
  vote on 18 March 2003."
</p>
<p>

  The spokesman added: "All these matters have been thoroughly 
  investigated and we stand by our position."
</p>
<p>
  * The Ministry of Defence will publish casualty figures for UK troops in 
  Iraq on its website within the next few weeks, the Government disclosed last 
  night. Defence Secretary John Reid said the figures &shy; which will be 
  regularly updated &shy; would identify the number of personnel categorised as 
  seriously injured and very seriously injured. He promised to alert MPs 
  before the first publication of the figures. The pledge came in a Commons 
  written reply.
