Britain was named today as one of 14 European countries which colluded with 
  the CIA in the operation of secret flights delivering terrorist suspects for 
  interrogation.

A report from Swiss MP Dick Marty for human rights watchdog the Council of 
  Europe says a group of countries acted as "staging posts" in the transfer by 
  American authorities of men wanted for questioning.
</p>
<p>

  They include Britain, Germany, Spain, and Turkey, who co-operated in the 
  running of so-called "rendition" flights - the covert transport of prisoners 
  for questioning in countries where, it is claimed, many faced torture.
</p>
<p>
  A preliminary report by Mr Marty earlier this year said European governments 
  were almost certainly aware of the CIA's secret prisoner flights via 
  European airspace or airports.
</p>
<p>
  Now, at the end of a seven-month inquiry, the final report says it is now 
  clear that "authorities in several European countries actively participated 
  with the CIA in these unlawful activities".
</p>
<p>
  Mr Marty warns that the inquiry has still not established the whole truth.
</p>
<p>
  But he condemns what he calls a "spider's web" of US rendition flights as 
  "utterly alien" to the concept of basic human rights. 

</p>
<p>
  Allegations that special American flights transported terrorist suspects to 
  Europe to be questioned were first raised in the Washington Post last 
  November.
</p>
<p>
  The paper said the CIA had been running interrogation centres in Eastern 
  Europe, Afghanistan and Thailand, and that more than 100 people had been 
  sent to the so-called "black sites" since they were set up following the 
  September 11 2001 terrorist attacks on America.
</p>
<p>
  Mr Marty said his inquiry had identified the "rendition" of more than one 
  hundred prisoners "affecting Europe".
</p>
<p>
  Mr Marty described the system as "the outsourcing of torture", by relocating 
  individuals for questioning in countries which do not necessarily follow 
  human rights codes.
</p>

<p>
  But his report has not delivered any firm evidence of the existence in any 
  European country of secret CIA detention centres, said to have been set up 
  since the 9/11 attacks.
</p>
<p>
  However, it states: "It is now clear, although we are still far from having 
  established the truth, that authorities in several European countries 
  actively participated with the CIA in these unlawful activities."
</p>
<p>
  And it emphases that suspicions remain of secret CIA detention centres in 
  Romania and Poland - allegations both countries have denied.
</p>
<p>
  Some European countries, while not actively involved in rendition flights, 
  "ignored them knowingly or did not want to know".
</p>
<p>

  There were "corroborated facts" strengthening the presumption that landing 
  points in Romania and Poland were detainee drop-off points near to secret 
  detention centres, said the report.
</p>
<p>
  Today Mr Marty, unveiling the details in Paris, commented: "Even if proof, 
  in the classical meaning of the term, is not as yet available, a number of 
  coherent and converging elements indicate that such secret detention centres 
  did indeed exist in Europe."
</p>
<p>
  Those elements warranted further investigation, he added.
</p>
<p>
  Mr Marty said he used evidence from national and international air traffic 
  control authorities, as well as sources inside intelligence services, 
  including in the United States, to compile a detailed picture of a global 
  system of secret detentions and unlawful transfers - including new analysis 
  revealing what he called "rendition circuits".
</p>
<p>
  He named seven countries which he said "could be held responsible, in 
  varying degrees, which are not always settled definitively, for violations 
  of the rights of specific individuals".

</p>
<p>
  They were the UK, Germany, Italy, Sweden, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Turkey and 
  the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.
</p>
<p>
  Seven more colluded, "actively or passively", in the detention or transfer 
  of unknown persons.
</p>
<p>
  Washington has never denied moving terrorist suspects to other countries for 
  questioning, but does deny allegations of torture, and of deliberately 
  picking centres in eastern Europe and beyond, outside the US human rights 
  jurisdiction.
</p>
<p>
  Mr Marty's report is now due to be debated by the Strasbourg-based Council 
  of Europe's Parliamentary Assembly later this month.
</p>

<p>
  The Assembly brings together 630 MPs from the 46 Council of Europe member 
  states, which include all 25 EU member states.
