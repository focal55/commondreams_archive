<p>NEW YORK - June 14 - This morning all reporters were expelled from Guantánamo Naval Base by a directive from the Office of Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, rescinding an invitation from the admiral in charge of the prison to cover the recent deaths of three detainees.  The deceased detainees were represented by the Center for Constitutional Rights (CCR) and co-counsel, which have called for an emergency, independent investigation of the deaths.  

 

<p>Today CCR forcefully condemned the expulsion of reporters from the base, and the human rights organization emphasized that the administration's crackdown on the press was particularly disturbing given the significant questions about this weekend's deaths.  

 

<p>"At a time when the administration must be transparent about the deaths at Guantánamo, they are pulling down a wall of secrecy and avoiding public accountability.  This crackdown on the free press makes everyone ask what else they are hiding down there?" said Gitanjali Gutierrez, a CCR attorney who is preparing to visit the base to meet with clients next month.  "This press crackdown is the administration's latest betrayal of fundamental American values.  The Bush Administration is afraid of American reporters, afraid of American attorneys and afraid of American laws," she added.

 

<p>CCR, which represents over 200 detainees, is calling on the administration to allow an emergency, independent inspection of the base to confirm the causes of the death and provide an authoritative determination of the health of all the detainees in Guantánamo.  CCR is calling for the trip to begin within six days and be led by doctors, CCR attorneys and independent, non-government observers who will publicly report on the findings -- to the extent possible with respect to the privacy of affected families.  CCR is also urging the U.S. government to begin the urgent task of closing the entire Guantánamo prison.
