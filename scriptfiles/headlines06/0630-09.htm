<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><P>The dean of library services at the University of the Incarnate Word has      canceled the library's subscription to the New York Times to protest      articles exposing a secret government program that monitors international      financial transactions in the hunt for terrorists.      
<p>       &quot;Since no one elected the New York Times to determine national security        policy, the only action I know to register protest for their        irresponsible action (treason?) is to withdraw support of their        operations by canceling our subscription as many others are doing,&quot;        <a href="mailto:morgan@uiwtx.edu">Mendell D. Morgan Jr.</a> wrote Wednesday in an e-mail to library staffers.        &quot;If enough do, perhaps they will get the point.&quot;     </p>     
<p>       The university released a statement Thursday saying Morgan had the        authority to remove the newspaper.     </p>     <p>       &quot;The University of the Incarnate Word does not take an official position        on the recent decision to cancel the subscription of the New York Times        at the university's library,&quot; the statement said. &quot;This decision was        made by the administrator in charge of the library whose authority        extends to the contents of the library, and thus it was within his        purview to make this decision. The university is supportive of the First        Amendment, a free press and of the presentation of diverse points of        view.&quot;     </p>     <p>       Morgan was on vacation and not available for comment. UIW President Lou        Agnese and board Chairman Fully Clingman also were away and couldn't be        reached for comment.</p>     
<p>       The move outraged library staffers, who complained the dean was        censoring information based on personal beliefs.     </p>     <p>       Staff member Jennifer Romo said she and her co-workers were shocked when        they received Morgan's e-mail.     </p>     <p>       &quot;The censorship is just unspeakable,&quot; Romo said. &quot;There is no reason, no        matter what your beliefs, to deny a source of information to students.&quot;      </p>     <p>       The removal also runs counter to the American Library Association's Bill        of Rights, which states: &quot;Libraries should provide materials and        information presenting all points of view on current and historical        issues. Materials should not be proscribed or removed because of        partisan or doctrinal disapproval.&quot;     </p>     <p>       The New York Times, followed by other papers, published the articles.        The Bush administration and conservative bloggers and commentators        quickly attacked the reports, lashing out at media, especially the        Times. Vice President Dick Cheney singled out the newspaper during a        speech in Nebraska. In a letter to the Times posted on the Treasury        Department's Web site, outgoing Secretary John Snow said the paper        &quot;alerted terrorists to the methods and sources used to track their money        trails.&quot;     </p>     <p>       U.S. Rep. Pete King, R-N.Y., who chairs the House Homeland Security        Committee, said in a letter released Monday that the attorney general        should investigate the Times for possible violation of the Espionage Act.     </p>     <p>       The House on Thursday approved a Republican-crafted resolution        condemning news organizations for revealing the program, saying the        disclosure had &quot;placed the lives of Americans in danger.&quot;     </p>     <p>       The resolution, passed 227-183 on a largely party-line vote, didn't        specifically name the Times or other news organizations that reported        the story.     </p>     <p>       The Times reported Tuesday that its managing editor, Bill Keller, said        in an e-mail statement that the decision to publish the story was &quot;a        hard call.&quot;     </p>     <p>       He noted the Bush administration has launched a number of &quot;broad, secret        programs&quot; aimed at fighting terrorism since 9-11.     </p>     <p>       He went on to say: &quot;I think it would be arrogant for us to pre-empt the        work of Congress and the courts by deciding these programs are perfectly        legal and abuse-proof, based entirely on the word of the government.&quot;      </p>     <p>       In his e-mail to library staff, Dean Morgan wrote of a &quot;change in        quality and shift in coverage in what was once 'the national newspaper        of record'&quot; and said that neither average citizens nor enemy terrorists        needed to know about the classified program in a time of war.     </p>     <p>       Romo, the UIW library staffer, said she respects Morgan's opinion about        the newspaper's decision to publish the reports. She added, however,        that using the university library is the wrong way to express his views.     </p>     <p>       &quot;We understand that pornography and things not of an academic nature        don't have a place in the library, but this is the New York Times,&quot; Romo        said. &quot;Whether it leans either way, it is still a staple and        representation of views in our country.&quot;     </p>     <p>       Romo's colleague, Tom Rice, a recent graduate of the University of North        Texas library sciences program, said that in pulling the Times, the        library contradicted everything he learned in school.     </p>     <p>       &quot;We felt like we were in an alternate reality when we read the e-mail,&quot;        Rice said. &quot;Then we realized how serious it was.&quot;     </p>     <p>       Andrew Herkovic, communications director for Stanford University's        libraries in California, said staffers make decisions about what they        collect for readers, but don't make those decisions on political        grounds. Like UIW, Stanford is a private university.     </p>     <p>       &quot;We would not withhold information from our readers as an expression of        disapproval of an important news source,&quot; Herkovic said.     </p>     <p>       Two UIW students studying outside the library Thursday said they took        issue with the Times reports, but did not think it was appropriate to        remove the newspaper from the library because it's an academic source.     </p>     <p>       &quot;I don't think they should have done it,&quot; said Richard Renteria, a        29-year-old senior.     </p>     <p>       This isn't the first time librarians have resisted pressure to limit        patrons' freedom or access to information. This week, federal        authorities dropped their demand under the U.S. Patriot Act for the        identities of patrons who logged on to a Connecticut public library        computer in February 2005. The decision came more than a year after        local librarians resisted and the American Civil Liberties Union filed        suit.     </p>     <p>       At least one media-watcher said she doubts Morgan's move will have much        impact.     </p>     <p>       &quot;In the real world, it's an almost futile act on many levels,&quot; said        Kelly McBride, ethics group leader at the Poynter Institute, a        journalism think tank in St. Petersburg, Fla. &quot;From what we know about        the reading habits of college students, it will not make a difference        because they read online.&quot;</p>     <p>       <i>The Associated Press contributed to this report. </i>     </p>

Subject: New York Times cancellation     </p>     <p>       I have cancelled the J. E. and L. E. Mabee Library subscription to the        print version of the New York Times effective today. For some years,        many have observed a change in quality and shift in coverage in what was        once &#8220;the national newspaper of record&#8221;. Recently they made a very        deliberate decision to publish vital intelligence information on        specific methods of SWIFT for tracing money transfers used to fund        terrorist activities in many parts of the world.     </p>     <p>       The US government held meetings with them to discuss this sensitive        information and had specifically asked them, along with other news        organizations, not to make this information public on the grounds of        national security interests. Despite the explanation of the serious and        sensitive nature of this information, the New York Times decided to make        it public, so everyone, including the sworn enemies of the United        States, would be fully informed. Now we all know. In time of war&#8212;and we        are in a time of war&#8212;this specific information is not something the        average citizen needs and the enemy most certainly does not.     </p>     <p>       This kind of intelligence operation had been successfully used to        apprehend some of the terrorists who have perpetrated crimes, and        prevented some other planned actions. These methods are among those that        have prevented further 9/11 attacks in our country and kept us        relatively safe in our homeland so far. This recent disclosure has now        neutralized a valuable method of finding information to keep us safe and        placed us and our families in a more vulnerable position. It may also        prolong the war effort and claim more American (and other) lives at home        and abroad.     </p>     <p>       Since no one elected the New York Times to determine national security        policy, the only action I know to register protest for their        irresponsible action (treason?) is to withdraw support of their        operations by canceling our subscription as many others are doing. If        enough do perhaps they will get the point.     </p>     <p>       Mendell D. Morgan, Jr.<br>Dean of Library Services     </p>     <p align="center">&copy; 2006 KENS 5 and the San Antonio Express-News</p>
