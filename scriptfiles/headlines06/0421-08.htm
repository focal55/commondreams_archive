<p>Last month while protesting the war in Iraq outside Congressman Mike Rogers&#039;,  R- Brighton, Lansing office, Terry Olson came up with an idea.<P>

&#034;Right in the middle of the week &#151; it was a long, hard, grind of a week &#151;  I looked up and saw the flower shop and thought it would be nice to do something positive to deliver our message,&#034; said Olson, who is a member of the Greater Lansing Network Against War &amp; Injustice, or GLNAWI.<P>

So Olson walked about a block from Rogers&#039; office to Bancroft Flowers &amp; Gifts, 1417 E. Michigan Ave., and purchased flowers to deliver as a form of protest to the war and Rogers, who has supported it.<P>

Olson said the idea of using flowers as a means of protest has spread.<P>

&#034;It&#039;s caught on, we&#039;ve gotten participation from people in different states and countries. People have been e-mailing or faxing (Rogers) pictures of flowers,&#034; Olson said. &#034;It&#039;s a cool way to utilize your democratic rights.&#034;<P>

Olson said about 14 dozen flowers have been delivered to Rogers&#039; office since the movement began.<P>

The flowers delivered to Rogers are being delivered to hospitals or given to area families whose family members are serving in the military overseas, said Sylvia Warner, Rogers&#039; spokesperson.<P>

&#034;The congressman appreciates the flowers, welcomes the group&#039;s comments and is deeply grateful for a free nation and the men and women who defend our right to have an opinion and express it openly,&#034; Warner said in an e-mail.<P>

However, the group of about 10 who gathered at Rogers&#039; Lansing office Thursday said they were not particularly well received when they delivered their flowers, which Rogers&#039; staff asked them to place in an empty wastebasket.<P>

&#034;I get a semi-cold response,&#034; said Spike Tyson, of Lansing. &#034;I make sure they know I am a twice-wounded veteran.&#034;<P>

Tyson, who has delivered flowers several times, said in addition to being a &#034;really good non-violent protest,&#034; the flowers have a symbolic meaning.<P>

The Vietnam War veteran said he purchases the flowers with Sacagawea and Susan B. Anthony dollars because both women were advocates for peace.<P>

In addition, he buys red flowers to symbolize the blood of soldiers dying for what he believes are illegitimate reasons.<P>

&#034;The flowers will die just like these soldiers will die,&#034; Tyson said.<P>

Olson said GLNAWI has requested to meet with Rogers, but the group hasn&#039;t been given the opportunity yet.<P>

&#034;We want to talk to him constructively about how to take steps to do what the people in the country want, and end the war,&#034; Olson said. &#034;You don&#039;t feel like you&#039;re being heard by the person who is representing you, so we have to result to these alternative ways.&#034;</div>
