RAMADI - The U.S. military has lost control over the volatile al-Anbar province, Iraqi police and 
residents say.<br>
<br>
The area to the west of Baghdad includes Fallujah, Ramadi and other towns that have seen 
the worst of military occupation, and the strongest resistance.
<br>
<br>
Despite massive military operations which destroyed most of Fallujah and much of cities 
like Haditha and al-Qa'im in Ramadi, real control of the city now seems to be in the hands 
of local resistance.
<br><br>
In losing control of this province, the U.S. would have lost control over much of Iraq.
<br><br>

"We are talking about nearly a third of the area of Iraq," Ahmed Salman, a historian from 
Fallujah told IPS. "Al-Anbar borders Jordan, Syria and Saudi Arabia, and the resistance 
there will never stop as long as there are American soldiers on the ground."
<br><br>
Salman said the U.S. military is working against itself. "Their actions ruin their goal 
because they use these huge, violent military operations which kill so many civilians, and 
make it impossible to calm down the people of al-Anbar."
<br><br>
The resistance seems in control of the province now. "No government official can do 
anything without contacting the resistance first," government official in Ramadi Abu Ghalib 
told IPS.
<br><br>
"Even the governor used to take their approval for everything. When he stopped doing so, 
they issued a death sentence against him, and now he cannot move without American 
protection."
<br><br>
Recent weeks have brought countless attacks on U.S. troops in Haditha, Ramadi, Fallujah 
and on the Baghdad-Amman highway. Several armoured vehicles have been destroyed, 
and dozens of U.S. soldiers killed in the al-Anbar province, according to both Iraqi 
witnesses and the U.S. Department of Defence.
<br><br>
Long stretches of the 550km Baghdad-Amman highway which crosses al-Anbar are now 
controlled by resistance groups. Other parts are targeted by highway looters.
<br><br>
"If we import any supplies for the U.S. Army or Iraqi government, the fighters will take it 
from us and sell it in the local market," trader Hayder al-Mussawi said. "And if we import 
for the local market, the robbers will take it."
<br><br>
Eyewitnesses in Ramadi say many of the attacks are taking place within their city. They say 
that the U.S. military recently asked citizens in al-Anbar to stop targeting them, and 
promised to withdraw to their bases in Haditha and Habaniyah (near Fallujah) soon, 
leaving the cities for Iraqi security forces to patrol.
<br><br>
"I do not think that is possible," retired Iraqi police Brigadier-General Kahtan al-Dulaimi 
from Ramadi told IPS. "I believe no local unit could stand the severe resistance of al-Anbar, 
and it will be the last province to be handed over to Iraqi security forces."

<br><br>
According to the group Iraq Coalition Casualty Count, 964 coalition soldiers have been 
killed in al-Anbar, more than in any other Iraqi province.. Baghdad is second, with 665 
coalition deaths.
<br><br>
Residents of Ramadi told IPS that the U.S. military has knocked down several buildings 
near the government centre in the city, the capital of the province.
<br><br>
In an apparent move to secure their offices, U.S. Army and Marine engineers have started 
to level a half-kilometre stretch of low-rise buildings opposite the centre. Abandoned 
buildings in this area have been used repeatedly to launch attacks on the government 
complex.
<br><br>
"They are trying to create a separation area between the offices of the puppet government 
and the buildings the resistance are using to attack them," a Ramadi resident said. "But 
now the Americans are making us all angry because they are destroying our city."
<br><br>
U.S. troops have acknowledged their own difficulties in doing this. "We're used to taking 
down walls, doors and windows, but eight city blocks is something new to us," Marine 1st 
Lt. Ben Klay, 24, said in the U.S. Department of Defence newspaper Stars and Stripes.
<br><br>
In nearby Fallujah, residents are reporting daily clashes between Iraqi-U.S. security forces 
and the resistance.
<br><br>
"The local police force which used to be out of the conflict are now being attacked," said a 
resident who gave his name as Abu Mohammed. "Hundreds of local policemen have quit 
the force after seeing that they are considered a legitimate target by fighters.."
<br><br>
The U.S. forces seem to have no clear policy in the face of the sustained resistance.
<br><br>

"The U.S. Army seems so confused in handling the security situation in Anbar," said 
historian Salman. "Attacks are conducted from al-Qa'im on the Syrian border to Abu 
Ghraib west of Baghdad, all the way through Haditha, Hit, Ramadi and Fallujah on a daily 
basis."
<br><br>
He added: "A contributing factor to the instability of the province is the endless misery of 
the civilians who live with no services, no infrastructure, random shootings and so many 
wrongful detentions."
<br><br>
According to the new Pentagon quarterly report on Measuring Security and Stability in Iraq, 
Iraqi casualties rose 51 percent in recent months. The report says Sunni-based insurgency 
is "potent and viable."
<br><br>
The report says that in a period since the establishment of the new Iraqi government, 
between May 20 and Aug. 11 this year, the average number of weekly attacks rose to 
nearly 800, almost double the number of the attacks in early 2004. 
<br><br>
Casualties among Iraqi civilians and security forces averaged nearly 120 a day during the 
period, up from 80 a day reported in the previous quarterly report. Two years ago they 
were averaging roughly 30 a day.
<br><br>
On Aug. 31 the Pentagon announced that it is increasing the number of U.S. troops in Iraq 
to 140,000, which is 13,000 more than the number five weeks ago.
<br><br>
At least 65 U.S. soldiers were killed in August, with 36 of the deaths reported in al-Anbar. 
That brought the total number killed to at least 2,642.
