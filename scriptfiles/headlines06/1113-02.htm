<p>Pastor Steve Madsen urged the 4,000 people worshiping at his Livermore 
evangelical church on the Sunday before the election to be sure to vote.  

<P>Madsen said he didn't push any issues or candidates, just made clear that 
parishioners should fulfill their moral duty. But exhortations like this have 
been a boon to Republican candidates and ballot measures, largely because 
evangelicals support the party's stances against abortion and same-sex 
marriage. 
<P>Evangelicals showed broad support Tuesday for President Bush and 
candidates aligned with him, bucking the nationwide trend that cost the GOP the 
House and Senate. But Republican and evangelical leaders said how the GOP 
reshapes its moral stances may determine the strength of their ties in the 
future. Two national Republican leaders said this fall that the party needs to 
soften some of its ideological positions in order to broaden its base.  
<P>Some Bay Area evangelical leaders also see the relationship weakening; 
they said they believe voting based solely on a party affiliation doesn't allow 
faith to enter into politics  --  as it should.  
<P>"Jesus wasn't a Republican or a Democrat," said Madsen, speaking in 
between services Sunday at Cornerstone Fellowship. "I think the church needs to 
transcend party lines. The church needs to say, 'The Bible is my platform.' " 
<P>And worshipers at Cornerstone on Sunday were split over whether their 
faith required them to vote Republican, although many said they were 
disappointed by the GOP losses. 
<P>As evangelicals in a liberal stronghold, several Bay Area ministers and 
believers said they are forced to wrestle with opposing beliefs here that 
evangelicals elsewhere might ignore. Some enjoy the challenge of ministering to 
the full breadth of the region's residents.  
<P>"If I'm just going to act like a hard-nosed Republican, I'm not going to 
have credibility with a Democrat," said Madsen. "And what the church needs is 
credibility." 

<P>For other evangelicals, living amid the Bay Area's divergent politics 
means they must rely more on their faith for direction.  
<P>"A lot of Christians might try to be more political and change policy," 
said Mark Cox, an assistant pastor at Bethel Christian Church, an evangelical 
congregation in San Francisco's Mission District. "We vote and we're concerned 
about issues. But that's not our emphasis. We try to spread the gospel, and 
tell people about who Jesus Christ is, to trust in God to change hearts  --  
and not worry too much about a political agenda."  
<P>Evangelicals cut across a variety of Protestant denominations, here and 
nationally. They believe in a literal reading of the Bible as the word of God, 
that Jesus is the son of God, and that believing in him and his teachings is 
the only path to eternal salvation. They actively share their faith with 
others.  
<P>Exit polls in 2004 revealed that 74 percent of white evangelicals voted 
for Republicans and 25 percent for Democrats. On Tuesday, Republicans received 
70 percent of the white evangelical vote and Democrats got 28 percent, only a 
slight change.  
<P>White evangelicals accounted for roughly 24 percent of the electorate, 
about the same as their proportion of the population.  
<P>"A great deal had been written about the discouragement of white 
evangelicals and how they might not turn out," said John Green, senior fellow 
in religion and American politics at the Pew Forum on Religion & Public Life. 
"This important element of the Republican electoral base held firm. They showed 
up in large numbers and voted Republican."  
<P>It was with other Christians that Democrats made their largest gains. 
National exit polls showed that Democrats made inroads with weekly churchgoers, 
cutting the Republican advantage in this group from 18 percentage points in 
2004 to 12 points on Tuesday. And Democrats won the Catholic vote, which they 
did not do in the last congressional election. 
<P>In part, this reflected the conservative leanings of some Democratic 
candidates such as Bob Casey, the Catholic, anti-abortion senator-elect from 
Pennsylvania. And Ohio's first Democratic governor in 16 years, Ted Strickland, 
is an ordained United Methodist minister who quoted biblical principles in his 
ads on Christian radio.  
<P>Many evangelicals believe these conservative Democrats' victories will 
help advance Christian conservative values.  
<P>"Social conservatives had a lot better night Tuesday than Republicans," 
said Richard Land, a top official in the evangelical Southern Baptist 
Convention, whose 16 million members make up the largest Protestant 
denomination in the country.  
<P>The shifting of Christian voters toward the Democratic Party prompted some 
Republican leaders to question the alignment of evangelicals and Republicans. 
Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., said Wednesday that the GOP needs to become "a lot 
more progressive and a lot less ideological."  
<P>Bay Area and national evangelical leaders, however, said that by straying 
from core conservative values, the GOP is in danger of losing their votes  --  
as well as those of less conservative Christians who already have crossed over 
to side with Democrats.  
<P>"It is true that evangelicals have strongly supported the Republican 
platform, but I also think they felt somewhat alienated by the Bush 
administration and the Republican Congress over the past six years," said Galen 
Call, the senior pastor at Los Gatos Christian Church, which draws 750 people 
on Sundays.  
<P>Like many evangelical leaders, Call said the deepening federal deficit and 
soaring federal spending are contrary to Christian values. Others also cited 
the Iraq war.  
<P>Call also said the Republican Party runs a risk by assuming that abortion 
and same-sex marriage are the only issues with which it can appeal to 
evangelicals. Social justice and caring for the poor are also essential issues 
for politicians to address, Call and others said.  
<P>At Cornerstone in Livermore on Sunday, worshipers said they were 
disappointed with many elements of Tuesday's election. Many were stung by the 
defeat of state Proposition 85, which would have required doctors to notify the 
parents of any girl younger than 18 who sought an abortion. 

<P>Oscar Teague said the election of anti-abortion Democrats to Congress 
meant little because they would still be dwarfed by their party's larger 
platform.  
<P>"I can't vote for someone who associates with that party," said Teague, 
33, who drives an hour from Turlock so he can attend services in Livermore with 
his girlfriend.  
<P>Lori Sloan of Livermore said she felt no obligation to vote for one party. 
She said both Democrats and Republicans represent elements of Christian values. 

<P>"Christians have the ability to not align ourselves with any political 
party," she said. "Christians are given the discernment to decide issues 
because of their relationship with God."
