shortages because of poor management of water resources and
soaring water usage, driven mainly by agriculture, the
International Water Management Institute said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Water scarcity around the world was increasing faster than
expected, with agriculture accounting for 80 percent of global
water consumption, the world authority on fresh water
management told a development conference in Canberra.</p>
<p>Globally, water usage had increased by six times in the
past 100 years and would double again by 2050, driven mainly by
irrigation and demands by agriculture, said Frank Rijsberman,
the institute's director-general.</p>
<p>Billions of people in Asia and Africa already faced water
shortages because of poor water management, he said.</p>
<p>"We will not run out of bottled water any time soon but
some countries have already run out of water to produce their
own food," he said.</p>
<p>"Without improvements in water productivity ... the
consequences of this will be even more widespread water
scarcity and rapidly increasing water prices."</p>
<p>The Sri Lanka-based institute, funded by international
agricultural research organisations, is due to formally release
its findings at a conference in Sweden later this month.</p>
<p>Rijsberman said water scarcity in Asia and Australia
affected about 1.5 billion people and was caused by
over-allocating water from rivers, while scarcity in Africa was
caused by a lack of infrastructure to get the water to the
people who need it.</p>
<p>"The water is there, the rainfall is there, but the
infrastructure isn't there," Rijsberman told reporters.</p>

<p>He said more needed to be done to promote rain-fed
agriculture and to increase water storage in Africa, where many
people live with water scarcity.</p>
<p>THE PRICE IS NOT RIGHT</p>
<p>"Irrigation needs to be reinvented," said Rijsberman,
adding irrigation in many countries was inefficient.</p>
<p>But scarcity problems could also be overcome by more
efficient water use, recycling and better pricing of water,
which in its bottled form was already rivaling the cost of oil.</p>
<p>Rising living standards in India and China would lead to
increased demand for better food, which would take more water
to produce, he said.</p>
<p>Rijsberman said the price of water would have to increase
to meet an expected 50 percent increase in the amount of food
the world will need in the next 20 years.</p>
<p>He said in Australia, five years into a drought, irrigation
water costs less than five U.S. cents a cubic meter, compared
to &#36;1 to &#36;2 per cubic meter for drinking tap water and &#36;100 to
&#36;200 per cubic meter for bottled drinking water.</p>

<p>Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer, whose
constituency covers the mouth of Australia's longest river
system, the Murray-Darling, said solving water problems was a
pressing problem for the world.</p>
<p>"Improving the efficiency of agricultural production and
water use is fundamentally important to improving economic
growth, sustainability and reducing poverty," Downer said.
<p>
The Murray-Darling runs through Australia's main crop and
food-growing region but water flows have dropped dramatically
because of drought and large amounts of river water pumped out
to irrigate cotton.
<p>
Downer said Australian researchers were working with
counterparts in China to develop new irrigation methods for
rice, while Australian aid programmes were working to improve
water in the Mekong River through Laos, Cambodia, Thailand and
Vietnam.
<p>
A report on global water by environment group WWF released
on Wednesday warned that rich nations, like Australia, were not
immune to the coming water crisis.
<p>
It said Sydney was using more water than could be
replenished and Australia had among the highest water usage in
the world.
<p>
Each day, urban Australians use an average of 300 litres of
water each, compared with Europeans who consume about 200
litres, while people in sub-Saharan Africa existed on 10-20
litres a day, said the report.
