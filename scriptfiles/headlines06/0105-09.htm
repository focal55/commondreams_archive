"If you don't want the war machine to invade your island, don't let it happen," said Sheehan, whose 24-year-old son died in Iraq and who gained international attention for staging an anti-war demonstration outside Bush's ranch in Texas.<p>

"Anybody can do what I do. We are the checks and balances for our country. We would like to see justice," she told the crowd of about 750.
<p>
The two-hour event at the University Avenue church also featured former U.S. Foreign Service Deputy Chief and Honolulu resident Ann Wright, who participated in Sheehan's protest in Crawford, Texas.<p>
"I think it's important that people learn the truth," said Mark-Anthony Pascua, a member of Not in Our Name, which organized the event. "You don't fight unjust wars."
<p>
After Sheehan spoke, the father of a Hawaii soldier who died in the war brought the audience to tears and spurred a standing ovation.<p>
Paul Wessel, father of Pfc. Kevin Wessel, said his son "really loved this country" and "really loved being a soldier." He went to war, his father said, to take the place of a married man and because he did not want to leave his friends behind.<p>
"Kevin sacrificed himself for the soldiers he was with," Wessel said, tears choking his speech. "We are losing this war via the death of a thousand cuts. We are losing two soldiers every day, and no matter how many we kill, they are being replaced."<p>
Kevin Wessel would have been 21 years old today.<p>
Before Sheehan's speech, two supporters of the U.S. war in Iraq held signs on the church lawn.<p>
"I feel that people need to hear the other part of the story," said Judy Jones, who held a sign that read, "Support Our Troops."<p>
"I feel we've really made some successes in Afghanistan and Iraq. I disagree with bringing the troops back before the job is done," she said.<p>

Since her Texas demonstration, Sheehan has been traveling around the world, making speeches at conferences and leading anti-war protests.<p>
Over the past week, Sheehan has been vacationing on Kauai. She was set to fly out of Honolulu last night, hours after the speech.<p>
Last night, she told audience members that she never got involved in anything before her son's death because she believed she could not make a difference.<p>
"But we are the ones that have the power," she said. "We have a voice."<p>
She said Bush should either resign or be impeached for leading the country into war, and she promised to "fight to bring down the war machine in this country."<p>
After the speech, Sheehan got a roaring round of applause. Many said they were happy that she was able to make an appearance in the islands.<p>
"She's got a story to tell and the courage to tell it," said Scott Allen, an administrator at a private school.<p>
Wright, who resigned in 2003 to protest the U.S. invasion of Iraq, told audience members that the anti-war movement "needs help" from more citizens.<p>
"We have to be really, really, really tough right now," Wright said. "This is a very serious and deadly time."<p>
