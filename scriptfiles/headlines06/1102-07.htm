Britain has sleepwalked into becoming a surveillance society that increasingly intrudes into our private lives and impacts on everyday activities, the head of the information watchdog warns. 
<p>
  New technology and "invisible" techniques are being used to gather 
  a growing amount of information about UK citizens. The level of surveillance 
  will grow even further in the next 10 years, which could result in a growing 
  number of people being discriminated against and excluded from society, says 
  a report by the Information Commissioner, Richard Thomas.
</p>
<p>
  Future developments could include microchip implants to identify and track 
  individuals; facial recognition cameras fitted into lampposts; and unmanned 
  surveillance aircraft, predict the report's authors.
</p>
<p>
  Mr Thomas,who heads an independent body that promotes public access to 
  official information, calls for a debate on what level of surveillance is 
  acceptable.
</p>
<p>
  He said: "Two years ago I warned that we were in danger of sleepwalking 
  into a surveillance society. Today I fear that we are in fact waking up to a 
  surveillance society that is already all around us.
</p>

<p>
   "As ever more information is collected, shared and used, it intrudes 
  into our private space and leads to decisions which directly influence 
  people's lives.
</p>
<p>
   "Mistakes can also easily be made with serious consequences - false 
  matches and other cases of mistaken identity, inaccurate facts or 
  inferences, suspicions taken as reality, and breaches of security.
</p>
<p>
   "I am keen to start a debate about where the lines should be drawn. 
  What is acceptable and what is not?"
</p>
<p>
  He was speaking at the launch of a report funded by the Information 
  Commissioner's Office, which analyses current and future levels of 
  surveillance. The study - "A Surveillance Society"- concludes that 
  routine monitoring is increasing in most areas of life.
</p>
<p>

  This includes the systematic tracking and recording of travel and use of 
  public services; automated use of CCTV; analysis of buying habits and 
  financial transactions; and the monitoring of telephone calls, e-mail and 
  internet use in the workplace.
</p>
<p>
  The major surveillance techniques include:
</p>
<p>
  * Video cameras monitoring buildings, shopping streets and residential 
  areas. Automatic systems can now recognise vehicle number plates and faces.
</p>
<p>
  * Software that analyses spending habits and the data sold to businesses. 
  When we call service centres or apply for loans, insurance or mortgages, how 
  quickly we are served and what we are offered can depend on what we spend, 
  where we live and who we are.
</p>
<p>
  * Electronic tags to monitor offenders on probation.

</p>
<p>
  * DNA taken from those arrested by the police and placed on a database.
</p>
<p>
  * Information stored about foreign travel.
</p>
<p>
  * Smart cards in schools to determine where children are, what they eat or 
  the books they borrow.
</p>
<p>
  * Taps on telephones, e-mails and internet use that can screened for key 
  words and phrases by British and US intelligence services.
</p>

<p>
  The Government also still plans to introduce a new system of biometric ID 
  cards, including "biometrics" - fingerprints and iris scans - 
  linked to a database of personal information.
</p>
<p>
  The group of academics who compiled the report have also predicted future 
  trends in surveillance in the next decade. The include:
</p>
<p>
  * Shoppers being scanned as they enter stores. This will be matched with 
  loyalty card data to affect how they are handled, with big spenders given 
  preferential treatment over others.
</p>
<p>
  * Cars linked to global satellite navigation systems which will provide the 
  quickest route to avoid congestion and allow police to monitor speed and to 
  track selected cars.
</p>
<p>

  * Employees subjected to biometric and psychometric tests plus lifestyle 
  profiles with diagnostic health tests common place. Jobs are refused to 
  those who are seen as a health risk.
</p>
<p>
  * Schools using card systems to allow parents to monitor what their children 
  eat, their attendance, academic and drug test results
</p>
<p>
  * Facial recognition systems to monitor our movements using tiny cameras in 
  lampposts and walls, and unmanned aircraft above.
</p>
<p>
  David Murakami Wood, a co-author of the report carried out by the 
  Surveillance Studies Network said: "The level of surveillance in this 
  country should shock people - it is infiltrating everything we do. The 
  question is whether we want that or not. Most people do not understand how 
  the information is used - for example details obtained from supermarket 
  loyalty cards and credit cards are bought and sold to other companies to 
  provide complex profiles of individual customers.
</p>
<p>
   "It is difficult to challenge these organisations, find out what data 
  they have on you, or to change inaccurate information." 

</p>
<p>
  <b>Keeping up with the Joneses &shy; day in the life of one family</b>
</p>
<p>
  It is London in 2006. The Jones family are returning from their holiday in 
  Florida.
</p>
<p>
  In the US they were photographed and fingerprinted on arrival. At Gatwick 
  they have their hand luggage X-rayed and hand-searched, and they are all 
  questioned. Passports &shy; one member of the family has dual nationality with 
  Pakistan &shy; are checked. Details of the flight and all other travel 
  information is recorded.

</p>
<p>
  The family are seen by airport security cameras and on the courtesy bus, 
  which drops them at the car park, which is also covered by CCTV.
</p>
<p>
  As the family drives out of the airport, they switch on a sat-nav system, 
  which guides them home, but also alerts them to speed and traffic-light 
  cameras on the way &shy; which record their progress. The son uses his mobile to 
  call a friend &shy; this is logged by the telephone company and could be used by 
  police to locate where the phone was at the time.
</p>
<p>
  On the way back they stop at an out-of-town mall. CCTV records them in the 
  car park and entering the supermarket. All details of their shopping is 
  recorded when they pay using a loyalty card. This will be used to build up a 
  customer "profile" and can be sold on to others.
</p>

<p>
  The money they spend on credit cards is also monitored to check for any 
  unusual spending patterns, which could indicate the card has been stolen. 
  The amounts spent and whether the family keep within agreed credit levels is 
  also monitored and will be used by the bank or building society.
</p>
<p>
  Later they go through the congestion charging zone &shy; which they pay for via 
  the mobile &shy; and all details, including photographs of them entering central 
  London, are recorded.
</p>
<p>
  At home in central London they unload under the watch of a neighbour's 
  private CCTV system. Waiting at home is a pile of junk mail. The names and 
  addresses of the family have been obtained from a variety of databanks.
</p>
<p>

  The son goes to his room to read a letter telling him his criminal records 
  check is clear and that he has a place on a voluntary scheme.
</p>
<p>
  He orders a takeaway &shy; his address, card details and previous orders are 
  already held by the pizza chain.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Britain under surveillance</b>
</p>
<p>
  * The national DNA database holds profiles on about 3.5 million people.

</p>
<p>
  * There are an estimated 4.2 million CCTV cameras in Britain: one for every 
  14 people.
</p>
<p>
  * More than half of the UK population posseses a loyalty card issued by the 
  firm that operates the Nectar scheme.
</p>
<p>
  * Since 2002 there have been more than 8 million criminal records checks for 
  jobs, of which around 400,000 contained convictions or police intelligence 
  information.
</p>
<p>
  * There are plans to expand capacity to read vehicle number plates from 35 
  million reads per day to 50 million by 2008.
</p>

<p>
  * Some 216 catalogue companies in the UK are signed up to the Abacus 
  data-sharing consortium, with information on 26 million individuals. 
</p>
<p>
  * The database of fingerprints contains nearly 6 million sets of prints.
</p>
<p>
  * An individual can be captured on more than 300 cameras each day.
</p>
<p>
  * By the end of 2002 law enforcement bodies had made more than 400,000 
  requests for data from mobile network operators. 
</p>
<p>

  * The number of motorists caught by speed cameras rose from 300,000 in 1996 
  to over 2 million in 2004.
</p>
<p>
  * In the year to April 2005 some 631 adults and 5,751 juveniles were 
  electronically tagged.
