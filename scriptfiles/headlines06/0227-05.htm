<a href="http://www.peace-action.org">Peace Action</a>, an organisation based in the Greater Washington Area, said it "denounced" the plan for President Bush to lay a memorial wreath in honour of the champion of non-violence at the Gandhi memorial in New Delhi during his three-day visit beginning Wednesday.

<p>"Mahatma Gandhi was a man of non-violence and peace and is a hero to people all over the world. As his war-strewn presidency shows, George Bush knows nothing about non-violence. Gandhi would in no way condone his actions. Bush should reconsider this cynical, disrespectful display of symbolism," said Kevin Martin, executive director of Peace Action, in a press release.

<p>Furthermore, the group maintained, that Bush was seeking to sign a nuclear deal with India, which was even more contradictory of Gandhi's views.

<p>"Does Bush think Gandhi would bless one of the main purposes of this trip -- to promote nuclear aid to India?" questioned Martin. "Gandhi abhorred nuclear weapons and would surely call for the US and India to pursue the abolition of nuclear weapons."

<p>Peace Action, in its release, claims to be the largest peace and disarmament organisation founded in 1957, and says it has more than 90,000 members nationwide.
