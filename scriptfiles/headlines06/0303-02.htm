 An aide to Ibrahim al- Jaafari, the Prime Minister, meanwhile, lashed out at 
  Sunni, Kurdish and secular political leaders who have mounted a campaign to 
  deny him another term, saying the Shia United Iraqi alliance will not change 
  its candidate.
</p>
<p>
  Haider al-Ibadi accused Mr Jaafari's critics of trying to delay the 
  formation of a new government. "There are some elements who have 
  personal differences with Mr Jaafari. The Alliance is still sticking to its 
  candidate," he said.
</p>
<p>
  Leaders of three parties, including Sunnis, Kurds and the secularists of the 
  former prime minister Iyad Allawi, agreed on Wednesday to ask the main Shia 
  bloc to withdraw Mr Jaafari's nomination for prime minister. Shia officials 
  confirmed receiving a letter asking them to put forward a new candidate.

</p>
<p>
  The move raises a new hurdle in US-backed talks on an inclusive government, 
  which broke down last week when Sunni parties pulled out in protest against 
  attacks on Sunni mosques triggered by the bombing on 22 February of the 
  golden-domed Askari shrine, a Shia mosque in the central city of Samarra.
</p>
<p>
  Hundreds were killed in the sectarian fury that followed. They included 45 
  Sunni preachers and mosque staff, according to Sheikh Ahmed Abdul Ghafour 
  al-Samaraie, the head of the government's Sunni Endowment, which takes care 
  of Sunni mosques and shrines. He told a news conference that 37 Sunni 
  mosques were destroyed and 86 were damaged by grenades, rockets or gunfire. 
  Six others remained in the hands of Shia militiamen, he said.
</p>
<p>
  Yesterday's bomb attack in the Baghdad vegetable market killed at least 
  eight people and wounded 14. Police evacuated the market after finding a 
  second bomb. Another bomb exploded in a minibus travelling through Sadr 
  City, a Shia ghetto in the Baghdad, killing five.
</p>
<p>
  Gunmen also attacked the car of Adnan al-Dulaimi, the senior Sunni cleric 
  who leads the Sunnis' largest parliamentary bloc. One bodyguard was killed. 
  Mr Dulaimi had already sped away in another vehicle.
</p>

<p>
  In the aftermath of the attacks, the government announced a one-day ban on 
  private vehicles in Baghdad and its outskirts.Police and army were 
  instructed to seal off the capital and seize any private vehicles that defy 
  the ban.
