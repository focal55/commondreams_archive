<p> Britain has secretly honoured a raft of senior US military and business 
  figures in the past three years, it emerged last night. The recipients 
  include General Tommy Franks, the man responsible for the &quot;Shock and Awe
  &quot; Iraq war attack plan, and Riley Bechtel, head of the Bechtel 
  Corporation.

<p>
  Mr Bechtel, the billionaire head of the US-based engineering giant, was 
  handed a CBE for "services to UK-American commercial relations" in 
  2003, according to information obtained by The Observer. He is a likely 
  bidder for future nuclear plants in the UK and has made hundreds of millions 
  of dollars in reconstruction projects in Iraq. Others honoured include 
  several senior US military figures, among them Vice-Admiral Timothy Keating, 
  the man in charge of maritime forces during the Iraq invasion, and Rear 
  Admiral Barry Costello, commander of the Third Fleet and Task Force 55.

</p>
<p>
  Releasing the information in a parliamentary answer, the Foreign Secretary, 
  Margaret Beckett, said: "Awards to citizens where Her Majesty the Queen 
  is not head of state are not formally announced." The Government last 
  night denied claims that it had made a secret of the honours, but a Foreign 
  Office spokeswoman accepted they might not have been "pro-actively"
   publicised at the request of the recipients.
</p>
<p>
  Opposition MPs suspect the awards were kept quiet to avoid awkward 
  questions. Norman Baker, the Liberal Democrat MP who helped unearth the full 
  list of foreign honour recipients, said: "These awards are supposed to 
  be for good works and those who have helped Britain. Instead it seems they 
  are being handed out to those that have supported [Tony] Blair's misguided 
  policies." 
</p>
<p>
  The revelation comes after a row over the award in the Queen's Birthday 
  Honours of a CBE for the police chief under investigation by the inquiry 
  into the Stockwell shooting. Assistant Commissioner Andy Hayman received the 
  award despite facing a disciplinary charge as a result of the Independent 
  Police Complaints Commission inquiry.
</p>
<p>
  The allegations against the police chief are said to relate to a briefing he 
  gave journalists in the afternoon after the Stockwell shooting last July 
  about the dead man's identity and links to terror groups.
</p>

<p>
  Mr Hayman, who heads the Met's anti-terror operations, was also in command 
  of the bungled Forest Gate raid two weeks ago, in which a man was shot and 
  injured before being released without charge.
</p>
<p>
  Muslim leaders say the honour could inflame community tensions in the 
  aftermath of the London raid, for which Mr Hayman was forced to apologise.
