<p>Eighteen months after Condoleezza Rice took charge of US diplomacy, the United States is still struggling to define its message to the world, amid contradictions between its defence of democracy and the "war on terror".</p>
<p>The annual Pew Research Center survey of world opinion this week showed that the Iraq war and the presence of US soldiers in the country weigh heavily on the reputation of the United States in Muslim countries as well as in Europe and Japan.</p>
<p>Several incidents last week also highlighted the difficulties President George W. Bush's administration faces in avoiding hurting sensibilities, especially in the Arab world.</p>
<p>That challenge was starkly brought forward earlier in the week, when a senior official claimed that the suicides of three Guantanamo Bay detainees was a "good PR move".</p>
<p>The comment was made by Colleen Graffy, deputy assistant secretary of state for public diplomacy, whose office is entrusted with improving the US image abroad.</p>
<p>Graffy's remarks were later disowned by a top defense official.</p>
<p>Bush himself acknowledged during the week that the detention center in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, where inmates are held without trial, sends the wrong signal to US allies.</p>
<p>"No question, Guantanamo sends, you know, a signal to some of our friends -- provides an excuse, for example, to say 'The United States is not upholding the values that they're trying (to) encourage other countries to adhere to,'" Bush said.</p>

<p>The president's surprise visit to Iraq on Tuesday was another example of his administration's tendency to overlook the sensitivities of even its closest allies.</p>
<p>Though Washington repeatedly touts Iraq as a sovereign state, Bush's visit was organized in such secrecy that even the new prime minister of the country, Nuri al-Maliki, was informed only a few minutes before shaking hands with the president.</p>
<p>"Obviously, when you're entering into a situation where the enemy is so active, we have to be extra cautious," said Dan Bartlett, a senior Bush adviser, insinuating that Washington did not trust Maliki enough to give him a heads-up about the president's visit.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, last week's incidents took place amid efforts by Washington to improve the US image abroad.</p>
<p>According to official figures, the administration allocates one billion dollars a year on public diplomacy, and next year's budget is expected to jump to 1.4 billion dollars.</p>
<p>Rice, who last month broke with 26 years of US policy by agreeing to join direct negotiations with Iran on its controversial nuclear program, has since maintained an absolute silence on incentives offered the Islamic republic.</p>
<p>A high-ranking State Department official said Washington wanted to avoid backing the leaders into a corner and wanted to give them time "to digest" the proposals put on the table.</p>
<p>But even if the Bush administration manages to refine its message to the outside world, it has a long way to go to be convincing, experts say.</p>
<p>"The Bush administrations emphasis on the Iraq war as the leading wedge of its democracy-promotion policy in the Middle East has closely associated democracy promotion with the assertion of American military power and security interests," Thomas Carothers, of the Carnegie Endowment for Peace, testified before Congress last week.</p>

<p>"With the US intervention in Iraq viewed as illegitimate in most parts of the world, the legitimacy of the general concept of democracy promotion has suffered accordingly," he said.</p>
