The world's growing number of poor slum
dwellers is a ticking time bomb that governments dare not
ignore, the United Nations said on Friday.
<p>The world will pass a critical point in 2007 when the
majority of its 6 billion people will be urbanized, the world
body said.</p>

One-third of them will be slum dwellers, many trapped in
poverty but overlooked by governments and with no prospects of
improvement.</p>
<p>"When a critical mass of people are in one place, if you
don't empower them they will empower themselves through
revolution," Anna Tibaijuka, head of UN-HABITAT said in London,
presenting the agency's State of the World's Cities 2006/7
report.</p>
<p>"If we want to avoid chaos we have to empower the poor
people," she told a news conference ahead of the third World
Urban Forum meeting in Vancouver, Canada, from June 19-23.</p>
<p>Far from being better off than their rural cousins, the
urban poor were in many ways worse off, ignored by aid agencies
and with little access to housing, adequate sanitation, clean
water, education or health services.</p>
<p>For example, even the children of relatively affluent slum
dwellers had higher rates of killer diarrhea than poor children
in the countryside, the report said, noting that slum dwellers
also tended to die young.</p>
<p>Tibaijuka said the world's slum dwellers faced multiple
disadvantages being near to services, durable housing and the
seat of political power but having no access to any of them.</p>
<p>This in turn led to rising divisions and tensions between
the "haves" and "have nots" in burgeoning towns and cities.</p>

<p>In sub-Saharan Africa, 72 percent of the urban population
live in slums, attracted there by prospects of a better life
but, once sucked in, are trapped in a cycle of poverty,
degradation and violence.</p>
<p>By 2030, the urban population of Africa, the least
urbanized continent, will be larger than the total population
of Europe, the U.N. report said.</p>
<p>"The peace and stability of cities is in question if the
majority are in slums," Tibaijuka said, urging governments not
to simply bulldoze them as President Mugabe had done in
Zimbabwe but to provide housing and services for them.</p>
<p>The report said that in seven African countries surveyed,
Burkina Faso, Burundi, Ghana, Kenya, Mali, Niger and Zambia,
HIV/AIDS was more prevalent in the urban than rural population.</p>
<p>It also noted the rise of mega- and even metacities --
conurbations with populations of more than 10 million and 20
million respectively -- saying nine percent of the world's
people now live in megacities against four percent in 1975.</p>
<p>The trend is accelerating, the report said, noting that by
2030, nearly 4 billion people, or 80 percent of the world's
urban dwellers, will live in cities of the developing world.
