Governments who cut their armed forces
end up relying on private suppliers to transport their weapons
with few controls, <a href="http://www.amnesty.org">Amnesty International</a> said on Wednesday.
<p>And as these logistics networks proliferate in conflicts
across the globe, international arms control rules are now
floundering, the human rights group said in a new report urging
tough government action to re-impose control.</p>

        <!--/endimage/--> "Arms supply chains are becoming increasingly
sub-contracted and completely out of control," Amnesty's arms
expert Brian Wood told Reuters. "They are talking about curbing
brokering but they haven't even got round to transport."</p>
<p>"Brokering is increasingly common, with main contractors
sub-contracting supply, transportation and collection in an
ever lengthening and increasingly opaque chain," he added as
his report "Dead on Time - arms, transportation, brokering and
the threat to human rights" was published.</p>
<p>Not only were governments exploiting the poor controls to
hide their activities, but increasingly armed opposition groups
and organized crime rings were taking advantage of the murky
markets to obtain their weaponry, he said in an interview.</p>
<p>The report, published ahead of a United Nations meeting
late next month on small arms trafficking, says that
increasingly weapons are either destined for or diverted to
countries under arms embargoes or to insurgent and criminal
groups.</p>
<p>At the same time the financial arrangements for these
shipments has become increasingly complex, with large sums of
cash changing hands or arms and ammunition being bartered for
narcotics or natural resources like gems, oil and timber.</p>
<p>It called for governments to reestablish control over the
arms trade -- especially the brokerage and transport firms.</p>
<p>"All these controls are inadequate and antiquated. There
must be proper systems of vetting and licensing," Wood said.</p>

<p>The report said the end of the Cold War and collapse of the
Soviet Union in 1991 unleashed not only a flood of cheap arms
but also the giant aircraft needed to carry them across the
globe to wars in Africa, Latin America and the Middle East.</p>
<p>Wood said small scale brokers who had shielded government
involvement in the movement of arms and ammunition to the proxy
wars of the Cold War had now grown to become major players in
an increasingly diverse international weapons markets.</p>
<p>The report noted cases including US and Chinese arms
shipments to Nepal via circuitous routes, an attempt caught in
South Africa to secretly ship weapons from Brazil to Saudi
Arabia and Mauritius and Chinese arms send covertly to Liberia.</p>
<p>"The idea of arms being put on a plane in one country and
flown directly to the end recipient still does happen, but it
is increasingly the exception rather than the rule," Wood said.</p>
<p>The report cited the vast quantities of weapons in Bosnia
that were shipped after the war by the Alabama-based Taos
Industries Inc on behalf of the US Department of Defense to
Iraq for the new Iraqi Army after the overthrow of Saddam
Hussein.</p>
<p>It said Taos sub-contracted the multi-million dollar deal
to companies in Israel, Switzerland, Bulgaria and Britain, with
the first shipments being flown out of Bosnia via Aerocom which
had been accused in a 2003 UN report of smuggling arms to
Liberia.</p>
<p>However, records were very sketchy and one flight which was
logged out of Tuzla airbase on the way to Baghdad was never
recorded as arriving in Iraq, the report said.</p>
<p>"Even more importantly, it cannot be established with any
certainty that the weapons carried by Aerocom were actually
delivered in Baghdad," the report said.
