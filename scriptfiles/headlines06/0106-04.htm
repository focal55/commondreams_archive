<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p>Representative Tom DeLay&#39;s campaign
to get Republicans to dominate Washington lobbying may have
worked too well for Alexander Strategy Group.          
<p> The firm has links to no fewer than three of the scandals
convulsing the U.S. capital. One partner, former DeLay aide Tony
Rudy, is now a focus of a federal investigation of lobbyist Jack
Abramoff. The group&#39;s founder, former DeLay chief of staff Ed
Buckham, set up a South Korea junket for his old boss that
violated ethics rules. And the firm represents a company whose
owner, prosecutors allege, bribed former Representative Randy
Cunningham.          </p>
       <p> Alexander Strategy&#39;s links to lawmakers are an outgrowth of
a decade-long effort by DeLay, 58, to force lobbying firms to
hire more Republicans, who can direct corporate money to the
party. The system, known as ``DeLay Inc.&#39;&#39; or ``the K Street
Project,&#39;&#39; has fueled a surge of money in politics, and critics
say it has also created the potential for greater corruption.          </p>
       <p> ``Alexander Strategy Group is really part of DeLay Inc. and
Abramoff Inc.,&#39;&#39; said Melanie Sloan, a former federal prosecutor
who now heads Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in
Washington, an ethics watchdog group. ``There have been some
aggressive prosecutors trying to unravel those ties. I am sure
that Alexander Strategy is going to have more than Tony Rudy as
a problem when this is over.&#39;&#39;          </p>

       <p> Rapid Growth          </p>
       <p> Alexander&#39;s ties to DeLay, a Texas Republican and the
former House majority leader, helped it become one of
Washington&#39;s fastest-growing lobbying firms, with revenue
surging 20-fold from 2000 to 2004, according to lobbying-
disclosure reports.          </p>
       <p> Its DeLay ties go well beyond Rudy and Buckham. Jim Ellis,
the head of DeLay&#39;s political action committee, Americans for a
Republican Majority, also worked for the firm as a lobbyist.
Karl Gallant, who preceded Ellis as head of DeLay&#39;s political
action committee, is currently an Alexander lobbyist. And the
firm employed DeLay&#39;s wife, Christine, from 1998 to 2002, paying
her from $3,200 to $3,400 a month, according to Richard Cullen,
a lawyer for the former majority leader.          </p>

       <p> Another congressional spouse, Julia Doolittle, wife of
California Republican John Doolittle, helped Alexander with
bookkeeping for one of its clients, according to Justice
Department records.          </p>
       <p> Ellis faces money-laundering charges in Texas along with
DeLay, who was forced to give up his leadership post after his
September indictment. The case involves his PAC&#39;s alleged
attempts to steer corporate money to state legislative races.          </p>
       <p> From 2000 to 2003, the PAC paid at least $388,000 to
Alexander in fund-raising fees, FEC and Internal Revenue Service
records show.          </p>
       <p> `Nothing Wrong&#39;          </p>

       <p> Buckham and Rudy didn&#39;t return phone calls seeking comment.
Cullen, DeLay&#39;s lawyer, denied his client engaged in any
wrongdoing. DeLay ``knows that he has done nothing wrong,&#39;&#39;
Cullen said on Jan. 3, after Abramoff pleaded guilty to
conspiracy, mail fraud and tax evasion in the Justice Department
investigation of political corruption.          </p>
       <p> The DeLay-Buckham connection helped Alexander thrive. The
company, whose offices are along the Potomac River in
Washington&#39;s fashionable Georgetown district, brought in $7.8
million in 2004, an average of $650,000 for each of its 12
registered lobbyists, according to disclosures filed with
Congress. That compares with an average of about $250,000 per
registered lobbyist last year at Patton Boggs LLP, Washington&#39;s
biggest lobbying firm by revenue. Patton Boggs had revenue of
$30.6 million in 2004.          </p>
       <p> Giving to Republicans          </p>

       <p> Some of Alexander&#39;s money found its way to the Republican
Party. Its lobbyists gave at least $376,608 to Republican
candidates and party committees since 2001, according to Federal
Election Commission records. The 12 gave a total of $1,000 to
Democrats during that period.          </p>
       <p> ``The largest public image of DeLay Inc. would be Alexander
Strategy Group,&#39;&#39; said Kent Cooper, a former FEC official who
co-founded PoliticalMoneyLine, a Washington-based company that
tracks political finance. The firm&#39;s relationships with DeLay
and other lawmakers and spouses ``might be what prosecutors are
looking at.&#39;&#39;          </p>
       <p> Prosecutors are clearly looking at Rudy, 39, DeLay&#39;s former
deputy staff chief. Abramoff&#39;s plea agreement states that in
2000 a DeLay aide the government called ``Staffer A&#39;&#39; helped the
lobbyist defeat legislation that would have restricted Internet
gambling. People familiar with the case later said the staffer
was Rudy. In return, the wife of ``Staffer A&#39;&#39; was paid $50,000
through a charity, according to the plea. Rudy hasn&#39;t been
charged with a crime.          </p>

       <p> Measure Defeated          </p>
       <p> In July 2000, DeLay was one of 44 Republicans who voted
against the Internet Gambling Prohibition Act, while 165 party
members supported it. The legislation, which required 270 votes
to pass, fell short by 25 votes.          </p>
       <p> Alexander was also employed by Abramoff associate Michael
Scanlon, a former communications director for DeLay. Scanlon&#39;s
public-relations company, Capitol Campaign Strategies LLC, paid
$120,000 to the firm in 2002, according to records released by
the Senate Indian Affairs Committee in November.          </p>
       <p> Justice Department records show that Alexander was behind a
nonprofit association -- the Korea-U.S. Exchange Council -- that
was financed by South Korea&#39;s Hanwha Group and that flew DeLay
to Korea in August 2001. Congressional ethics rules ban
registered foreign agents from funding travel by members of
Congress; the trip added to the cloud of controversy surrounding
DeLay when it was reported by the Washington Post in March.          </p>

       <p> Possible Violation          </p>
       <p> Alexander, whose lobbyists signed the council&#39;s tax
returns, may be in violation of the law, says the IRS&#39;s former
head of nonprofit groups. While the council is registered with
the Internal Revenue Service as a nonprofit organization, its
business-oriented purpose documented in Justice Department
disclosures ``suggests tax-exempt status was not warranted,&#39;&#39;
said Marcus Owens, who headed the IRS division of tax-exempt
groups from 1990 to 2000.          </p>
       <p> Kelly Kramer, a lobbyist for the council at Nixon Peabody
LLP, didn&#39;t return phone calls and e-mails asking for comment.          </p>

       <p> In the years before the Korea trip, Buckham and Abramoff
had a close association. They used their credit cards to help
pay for a 2000 trip to the U.K. for DeLay and his wife, the
Washington Post reported in April. House rules bar members from
accepting travel from registered lobbyists. DeLay&#39;s office said
it had been told that a nonprofit group sponsored the trip.          </p>
       <p> ``He is someone on our side,&#39;&#39; Buckham said of Abramoff in
a 1995 interview with the National Journal. ``He has access to
DeLay.&#39;&#39;          </p>
       <p> The Cunningham Connection          </p>
       <p> One of the biggest clients Alexander landed was Group W
Advisors, a San Diego-based defense consultant. The company is
owned by Brent Wilkes, a businessman who is one of the four un-
indicted co-conspirators in a Nov. 28 criminal complaint for
allegedly bribing Cunningham, his lawyer, Michael Lipman, told
USA Today. Cunningham pleaded guilty and resigned his House seat
on Nov. 28.          </p>

       <p> Alexander took in at least $525,000 in fees from 2002 to
2004 from Group W to lobby on defense appropriations. Those
appropriations are among the legislative favors Cunningham gave
to receive his gifts, according to the former lawmaker&#39;s plea
agreement. It isn&#39;t clear what role, if any, Alexander
strategists had. Lipman didn&#39;t return a call seeking comment.          </p>
