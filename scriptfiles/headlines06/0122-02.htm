<p>HOUSTON - At least one Houston television station that rejected an <a href="http://www.pcactionfund.org/accountability/index.htm">ad targeting embattled U.S. Rep. Tom DeLay</a> said Saturday it would air a toned-down version.

<p>The original ad paid for by two liberal groups was supposed to start running on local stations last week, but the DeLay campaign sent letters asking them not to run the ad because it was misleading.

The general manager of KRIV-TV, D'Artagnan Bebel, would not say why the new 30-second spot was approved.

<p>The modified ad addresses alleged links between DeLay and the widespread congressional corruption probe of lobbyist Jack Abramoff.

<p>The ad, sponsored by <a href="http://www.ourfuture.org/">Campaign for America's Future</a> and <a href="http://www.pcactionfund.org/">Public Campaign Action Fund</a>, touts itself as ``the ad Tom DeLay doesn't want you to see.'' The announcer in the new version says DeLay ``received'' campaign contributions from Abramoff instead of ``pocketed.''

<p>DeLay spokeswoman Shannon Flaherty said the modified ad remains ``fraudulent.''

<p>``Any new decision they make is probably based more on their need for cash than upholding their credibility,'' Flaherty said of the station's decision to air the spot.

<p>Abramoff pleaded guilty this month to corruption charges in connection with congressional wining and dining.

<p>DeLay stepped aside as majority leader last fall when he was indicted in Texas on charges of laundering campaign funds. The Republican from Sugar Land announced this month that he would not try to regain the post.
