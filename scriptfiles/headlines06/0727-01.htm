<p>WASHINGTON - With congressional midterm elections less than four months away, the latest NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll finds that candidates will be facing a public that has grown increasingly pessimistic, as nearly two-thirds don't believe life for their children's generation will be better than it has been for them, and nearly 60 percent are doubtful the Iraq war will come to a successful conclusion.

<p>And there's more pessimism: Among those who believe the nation is headed on the wrong track, more than 80 percent say it's part of a longer-term decline.

<p>"This is just a horrendous set of numbers," says Democratic pollster Peter D. Hart, who conducted this survey with Republican Bill McInturff. The mood is "as dank and depressing as I have seen."

<p>According to the poll, 65 percent say they feel less confident that life for their children's generation will be better than it was for them. In December 2001, the last time this question was asked, respondents — by a 49-42 percent margin — said they were confident life would be better for their children.
<p>In addition, only 27 percent think the country is headed in the right direction, while 58 percent say they are less confident the Iraq war will come to a successful conclusion.

<p>And among those who believe that the nation is headed on the wrong track, a whopping 81 percent believe it's part of a longer-term decline and that things won't get better for some time. Just 12 percent think the problems are short-term blips.

<p><b>War Concerns Deepen</b>
<p>The NBC/Journal poll — which was conducted from July 21-24 of 1,010 adults, and which has a margin of error of plus-minus 3.1 percentage points — comes amid a new wave of escalated violence in Iraq. Just Tuesday, President Bush announced that the United States would strengthen the U.S. presence in Baghdad by moving additional soldiers to the city.

<p>The poll also comes as Israel battles the group Hezbollah in Lebanon. In the survey, 45 percent approve of Bush's handling of that conflict, while 39 percent disapprove. Moreover, regarding the recent violence there, 54 percent of respondents say they sympathize more with Israel, while just 11 percent side with Arab countries.
