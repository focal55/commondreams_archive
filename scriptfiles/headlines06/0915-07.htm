Civil Society Organization members wear masks with the words 'No Voice' printed on them and t-shirts which say 'Stand up against poverty, we must have a voice' during a silent protest Friday, Sept. 15, 2006 in Singapore at the allocated protest area in the venue of the IMF-World Bank annual meetings. About 40 activists from the <a href="http://www.whiteband.org/" target="_new">Global Call to Action Against Poverty</a> (GCAP) gathered in a confined space to highlight poor countries lack of a voice at the International Monetary Fund and World Bank which are currently holding meetings in the city-state.

About 30 people have became the first to hold a demonstration inside a designated area at the convention centre where the International Monetary Fund and World Bank are meeting in Singapore.</p>
<p>The protesters from the <a href="http://www.whiteband.org/" target="_new">Global Call to Action Against Poverty</a> (GCAP) wore masks emblazoned with the words "No Voice" to highlight restrictions on non-governmental groups (NGOs) at the meetings which began on Thursday.</p>
<p>Their silence also symbolized what the group said was the lack of a voice poor countries have at the IMF and the Bank.</p>
<p>Despite the World Bank's appeal for Singapore to allow NGOs accredited by the IMF and World Bank to hold outdoor protests during the meetings, Singapore refused to waive a long-standing ban on public demonstrations.</p>
<p>Instead, it has allowed them to protest inside the convention centre in a roped-off area smaller than a basketball court, where they must abide by numerous regulations.</p>
<p>Protesters can shout but cannot use bullhorns or other sound amplifiers to disrupt proceedings. Police will provide free plastic placards on which protesters can write slogans.</p>
<p>If demonstrators bring banners, they cannot hoist them with metal or wooden poles. Those are dangerous, police said. As a substitute, cardboard poles will be provided.</p>
<p>Before protesting, activists must scan themselves in by passing their accreditation cards over a laser scanner.</p>
<p>"I've never seen anything like this before. I've never seen any protester have to scan themselves into a protest zone," said Taylor Thompson, a spokeswoman for GCAP, a coalition that represents 36 million anti-poverty campaigners around the world.</p>

<p>"I think people should be allowed to protest wherever they choose to protest, peacefully," Thompson said.</p>
<p>At least 13 plainclothes security officers monitored the peaceful demonstration.</p>
<p>Police have said tough security measures were necessary because the country, Southeast Asia's most advanced economy, is a high-profile "terrorist" target and any public protests would compromise preparations.</p>
