<p>        

        Five years ago this week, the Taliban's al-Qa'ida allies made final 
  preparations to launch devastating attacks on America that would precipitate 
  the &quot;war on terror,&quot; the US led invasion of Afghanistan and the 
  subsequent invasion of Iraq. 
<p>
  Far from ending terrorism, George Bush's tactics of using overwhelming 
  military might to fight extremism appear to have rebounded, spawning an 
  epidemic of global terrorism that has claimed an estimated 72,265 lives 
  since 2001, most of them Iraqi civilians. 
</p>
<p>
  The rest, some 30,626, according to official US figures, have been killed in 
  a combination of terror attacks and counter-insurgency actions by the US and 
  its allies. The figures were compiled by the US based National Memorial 
  Institute for the Prevention of Terrorism (Mipt). 

</p>
<p>
  A US led-invasion swept away the Taliban regime in a matter of weeks, and 
  did the same to Saddam Hussein's Ba'ath Party in 2003, but far from bringing 
  stability and democracy to Afghanistan and Iraq, the outcome has been one of 
  constant warfare. Yesterday hundreds of Nato troops, backed by warplanes and 
  helicopter gunships, were involved in the offensive on the area, southwest 
  of Kandahar, that has been a centre of Taliban resistance. 
</p>
<p>
  Nato said more than 200 Taliban fighters were killed in the fierce fighting 
  in which four Canadian soldiers also died. Eighty Taliban fighters were 
  captured.
</p>
<p>
  The district where the Taliban leader, Mullah Omar, was born, south-west of 
  Kandahar, is again under Taliban control, a situation mirrored across large 
  swaths of the south of the country. The government of Hamid Karzai clings on 
  to the cities of the south while Nato forces in Kandahar and Helmand are 
  locked in an all-out war. 
</p>
<p>
  In Punjwai and Jerai districts south-west of Kandahar, as many as 1,500 
  Taliban fighters have been holding off repeated attempts by Afghan and 
  Canadian soldiers to dislodge them since May. Their resistance has marked a 
  new phase in the growing Taliban insurgency, an evolution from the 
  hit-and-run raids by groups of eight to 15 fighters that characterised the 
  attacks in the south previously to large bodies of fighters taking and 
  holding territory. 
</p>

<p>
  Operation Medusa, the latest attempt to dislodge them, began on Saturday and 
  involves some 2,000 troops. Highway 1, which links Kandahar to Lashkargar, 
  has been cut since June. Yesterday Nato forces placed a ban on civilian 
  movement along the road as helicopters and aircraft together with artillery 
  pounded suspected Taliban positions.
</p>
<p>
  In Iraq, three and a half years after the invasion, the situation remains 
  equally dire and the numbers of Iraqi casualtieshas soared by 51 per cent 
  according to US figures. Some 3,000 civilians are now dying every month in 
  Iraq the Pentagon says.
</p>
<p>
  President Bush has shifted his approach in an effort to shore up faltering 
  public support for the war. No longer does he stress the benefits of 
  securing peace in Iraq, but rather he is laying out the peril of a failure. 
</p>
<p>
  Observers of the President say that in recent weeks his language has become 
  increasingly grim as he details what he believes would be the consequences 
  of US withdrawal. "We can allow the Middle East to continue on its 
  course &shy; on the course it was headed before September the 11th," 
  he said in a speech last week. "And a generation from now, our children 
  will face a region dominated by terrorist states and radical dictators armed 
  with nuclear weapons. Or we can stop that from happening, by rallying the 
  world to confront the ideology of hate and give the people of the Middle 
  East a future of hope."

</p>
<p>
  Away from such rhetoric, the situation on the ground in Iraq only appears to 
  be getting worse. According to a new, grim assessment by the Pentagon, Iraqi 
  civilians are increasingly suffering as a result of the violence and chaos. 
</p>
<p>
  In recent months the numbers of Iraqi casualties &shy; both civilians and 
  security forces - has soared by 51 per cent. The deaths are the result of a 
  spiral in sectarian clashes as well as an ongoing insurgency against the US 
  and UK occupation that remains "potent and viable". The average 
  number of attacks of all types now stands at around 800 a week.
</p>
<p>
  "Although the overall number of attacks increased in all categories, 
  the proportion of those attacks directed against civilians increased 
  substantially," the Pentagon report said. "Death squads and 
  terrorists are locked in mutually reinforcing cycles of sectarian strife, 
  with Sunni and Shia extremists each portraying themselves as the defenders 
  of their respective sectarian groups." 
</p>
<p>
  The report said in the period since the establishment of an Iraqi government 
  in mid-May and 11 August, Iraqi civilian and security personnel have been 
  killed at a rate of around 120 a day. This is an increase from around 80 a 
  day between mid-February to mid-May. Two years ago the number stood at 30 a 
  day. Calculated over a year, the most recent rate of killings would equal 
  more than 43,000 Iraqi casualties.

</p>
<p>
  The Pentagon report, Measuring Security and Stability in Iraq, added: "
  The core conflict in Iraq changed into a struggle between Sunni and Shia 
  extremists seeking to control key areas in Baghdad, create or protect 
  sectarian enclaves, divert economic resources, and impose their own 
  respective political and religious agendas." 
</p>
<p>
  While the Pentagon may seek to portray such sectarian violence as the 
  biggest challenge, it admits that the anti-occupation insurgency remains 
  strong. 
</p>
<p>
  Indeed other figures, released this summer by the US military, suggest 
  attacks against US and Iraqi forces had doubled since January. The figures 
  showed that in July US forces encountered 2,625 roadside bombs, of which 
  1,666 exploded and 959 were disarmed. In January, 1,454 bombs exploded or 
  were found. The figures suggested that the insurgency had strengthened 
  despite the killing of senior al-Qa'ida fighter, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi in 
  June.
</p>
<p>
  Yesterday, the Iraqi authorities announced the arrest of a man they say is 
  the second-in-command ofal-Qa'ida in Iraq. Iraq's national security adviser, 
  Mowaffaq al-Rubaie, said Hamed Jumaa al-Saedi was detained a few days ago. 
  Mr Rubaie said the man was behind the bombing of a Shia shrine in Samarra in 
  February.
