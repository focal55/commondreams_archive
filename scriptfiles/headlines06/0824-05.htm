About 20 boats surrounded the Rainbow Warrior II ship after it sailed to the area on Wednesday to highlight the alleged over-fishing of blue-fin tuna.

The blockade was being lifted after the crew agreed to be towed to an unknown location by a navy ship, officials say.

The fishermen have accused Greenpeace of exaggerating the risks to tuna stocks in the Mediterranean.

  
  	
    
      <p />
    	  
  	
    
      
The dispute disrupted other vessels trying to use the port, including a number of cargo ships and ferries which were unable to set sail as planned.

The French fishermen began their action on Wednesday morning, and threatened to intensify their protests. 

    	  
  	
    
      <p />
    	  
  	
    
      
They denied Greenpeace's claims that blue-fin tuna was in danger of extinction in the Mediterranean, and also blamed Asian crews for any quota breaches. 

  
  	
    
      <p />
But Greenpeace France spokesman Pierre Ramel accused the fishermen of being in a state of denial about over-fishing.

    	  
  	
    
      <p />
"All this is a little pathetic. This is a form of censorship organised by a group of industrial fishermen who own very high-performing fleets and huge fishing resources, and they have no intention of allowing any challenges to large-scale, industrial fishing," he told France Inter Radio.
<p />
It is campaigning for an immediate ban on fishing to allow stocks to recover, and had wanted to enter Marseille to put its case.

    	  
  	
    
      <p />
The fishermen blame other countries for illegal fishing and say a ban would destroy their livelihoods. 

    	  
  	
    
      <p />
A report by the WWF, the global environment campaign, said that last year, at least 40% more tuna was caught in the Mediterranean than is allowed by fishing quotas.

    	  
  	
    
      <p />
The report blamed French fishermen, as well as those from Turkey, Libya and other countries, for the over-fishing.  

    	  
  	
    
      <p />
A French research institute has also said the fish stocks are being exploited in an unsustainable way, and says the growing fashion for sushi is to blame.
