<p>A climate change report by the Commonwealth Scientific and
Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO) found global warming
in the Asia Pacific region could cause sea levels to rise by up
to 16 cm (six inches) by 2030 and up to 50 cm (19 inches) by
2070.</p>

Rising temperatures will also result in increased rainfall
during the summer monsoon season in Asia and could cause more
intense tropical storms, inundating low-lying coastal villages.</p>
<p>"The coastlines of Asia-Pacific nations are generally
highly vulnerable to the effects of climate change,
particularly sea-level rise caused by rising global
temperatures," said the CSIRO report released on Monday.</p>
<p>"Vast areas of the Asia-Pacific are low lying, particularly
the small-island states, as well as the large river deltas
found in India and Bangladesh, Southeast Asia and China."</p>
<p>Sea level rise between 30 to 50 cm (11 to 19 inches) would
affect more than 100,000 km (62,140 miles) of coast,
particularly China's Pearl Delta and Bangladesh's delta, said
the report.</p>
<p>"As sea level rise exceeds half a meter, the area affected
in the Asia-Pacific region rises to over half a million square
kilometres, affecting hundreds of millions of people," it said.</p>
<p>"Large areas of Bangladesh, India, Vietnam are inundated
and Kiribati, Fiji and the Maldives are reduced to just a small
fraction of their current land area."</p>
<p>ENVIRONMENTAL REFUGEES</p>

<p>The report also said rising sea levels and increased
rainfall would spread infectious diseases in the region,
leaving millions more at risk of dengue fever and malaria.</p>
<p>It said local and regional economies would be hard hit by
chronic food and water insecurity, warning Sri Lanka's GDP
could fall by 2.4 percent with less than a two degree Celsius
warming.</p>
<p>The report also warned of environmental refugees fleeing
their flooded homelands, citing growing migration from some
South Pacific island states already suffering rising sea
levels.</p>
<p>Some 17,000 islanders applied for New Zealand residence in
the last two years, compared with 4,000 in 2003, it said.</p>
<p>The low-lying South Pacific island nation of Micronesia has
experienced an annual sea level rise of 21.4 mm since 2001.</p>
<p>The report, commissioned by Australian aid agencies,
prompted calls for Canberra to do more to combat climate change
and to be more open to environmental refugees.</p>
<p>Australia has not signed the Kyoto Protocol to cut
greenhouse gases, which cause global warming, and has rejected
requests from Pacific islands to take environmental refugees.</p>
<p>World Vision Australia chief, Reverend Tim Costello, called
on Australia to review immigration programs to consider people
displaced by rising sea levels.</p>
<p>"This is enlightened self-interest, because there are going
to be so many environmental refugees knocking on our door,
flooding here with the sea levels rise as predicted and...the
failure of economics and crops because of the rain changes in
so many of these countries," Costello told local radio.
