<p>WASHINGTON - Personal information stolen from the home of a Veterans Affairs employee included data on 2.2 million active-duty members of the military,  the government said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The veterans agency announced over the weekend that the theft last month involved data for only about 50,000 active-duty, National Guard and military personnel. </p>

<p>But the Defense Department said Tuesday that a comparison of records by the Pentagon and the veterans agency found that the stolen data theft may have included information on as many as 1.1 million active-duty service members, 430,000 National Guardsmen and 645,000 members of the Reserves.</p>
<p>When the government initially revealed the burglary on May 22, more than two weeks after it happened, it said the stolen data included the names, birthdates and Social Security numbers of up to 26.5 million veterans, and their spouses. </p>
<p>In a statement Tuesday, Jim Nicholson, the secretary of veterans affairs, said, "V.A. remains committed to providing updates on this incident as new information is learned." </p>
<p>A spokesman for the Veterans Affairs Department, Matt Burns, said the department had received no reports of stolen data being used for fraudulent purposes.</p>
<p>Advocates for veterans expressed outrage. </p>
<p> "The magnitude of this data breach is simply breathtaking and overwhelming," said Representative Lane Evans of Illinois, the top Democrat on the House Veterans' Affairs Committee. </p>
<p>The revelation came on the same day that some veterans groups sued the federal government, saying the theft had violated their privacy rights. </p>
<p>In a class action lawsuit filed Tuesday in Federal District Court in Washington, the veterans are seeking $1,000 each in damages and the disclosure of all military personnel affected by the data theft. </p>

<p>The veterans are also asking the court to bar department employees from using sensitive data until independent experts determine proper safeguards.</p>
<p>Mr. Burns, the veterans agency spokesman, told the Associated Press that the department did not comment on pending litigation. </p>
<p>The analyst whose home was burglarized has been placed on administrative leave. Department officials told Congress that he had been taking home sensitive data for three years before the theft last month.</p>
<p>Jim Nicholson, the veterans secretary, said in testimony to Congress that the employee had broken no law but had violated department policy. </p>
