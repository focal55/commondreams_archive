European politicians who opposed the 
U.S.-led war in Iraq say they feel vindicated by the Democrats' 
victory in U.S. mid-term elections and the resignation of 
Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld. 
<p> The reaction across the continent ranged from unrestrained  
gloating to diplomatic tiptoeing. But the bottom-line message to 
President George W. Bush over his Iraq campaign was: "We told 
you so". 
<p>    "The king has no clothes," said Pino Sgobio, lower house 
whip of a communist party in Prime Minister Romano Prodi's 
centre-left coalition. "These elections have certified the 
failure of six years of (U.S.) foreign and military policy." 
<p>    European governments, some of whom felt their views were 
ignored in the lead-up to the invasion of Iraq in 2003, 
expressed hopes for a new era of open dialogue on a more equal 
footing with Washington. 
<p>    Prodi, who came to power last May on an anti-war platform 
and has vowed to withdraw Italian troops from Iraq by the end of 
the year, said he hoped U.S.-European relations would have "less 
friction and more collaboration". 

<p>    His foreign minister, Massimo D'Alema, was far more direct. 
<p>    "The cycle of preventative wars, of unilateralism, has ended 
in a great failure that even the American public has 
acknowledged," he said. 
<p>    France, perhaps Europe's fiercest opponent of the war, said 
Bush and Rumsfeld had been forced to read the writing on the 
wall. 
<p>    "We always said what we thought about this action. It's up 
to them to analyse the situation and draw conclusions from that 
analysis," said French Defence Minister Michele Alliot-Marie. 
<p>     
<p>    "GREAT LOSER" 
<p>    The ruling Socialist Party of Spanish Prime Minister Jose 
Luis Zapatero, who pulled Madrid's troops out of Iraq after his 
surprise election victory in March 2004, said the vote was a 
thumbs-down to Washington's strategy on the war on terrorism. 
<p>    "The great loser is President Bush, and, especially, his 
foreign policy," Jose Blanco, the party's Organisation 
Secretary, said on a blog. 
<p>    "(Americans now) realise that invasions like that of Iraq 
don't get rid of the radicals, but have precisely the opposite 
effect." 

<p>    Germany's Greens party, a junior partner in the Berlin 
government at the time of the invasion and now in opposition, 
seemed to reflect the view of many leftist parties. 
<p>    "The (election) will put a strong damper on the one-sided 
and dogmatic policies of George W. Bush...This was the bill to 
the White House for their disaster in Iraq," Juergen Trittin, 
deputy head of Greens' parliamentarians, told N24 television. 
<p>    British Prime Minister Tony Blair's decision to send troops 
to Iraq divided his party and sharply split public opinion, and 
reaction to the elections was equally passionate. 
<p>    "I've never needed any convincing it was a mistake and many 
people in this country felt the same. We feel bitterly angry 
about marching on the streets and being completely ignored," 
said Ian Gibson, a Labour MP. 
<p>    "What is the tipping point when people get angry. Is it body 
bags?"
