<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><P>Despite an intensified campaign against poverty, World Bank programs have 
failed to lift incomes in many poor countries during the past decade, leaving 
tens of millions of people with stagnating and even declining living standards, 
according to a report released Thursday by the bank's autonomous assessment 
arm. 
<P>Among 25 poor countries probed in detail by the bank's Independent 
Evaluation Group, only 11 saw reductions in poverty between the mid-1990s and 
the early 2000s, while the other 14 suffered the same or worse rates over that 
term. The group said the sample is representative of the global picture. 
<P>"Achievement of sustained increases in per capita income, essential for 
poverty reduction, continues to elude a considerable number of countries," the 
report declared, singling out as particularly ineffective programs aimed at the 
rural poor. Roughly half of such efforts from 2001 to 2005 "did not lead to 
satisfactory results." 
<P>During that period, new loans and credits aimed directly at rural 
development totaled $9.6 billion, or about one-tenth of total World Bank 
lending, according to the group. 
<P>In a statement distributed with the report, World Bank management rejected 
its assessment as "overly bleak," arguing that the overall trend is improving 
in every region except Africa. Bank administrators noted that reducing poverty 
requires economic growth, something they said the world has been enjoying: Over 
the past two years, developing countries collectively grew by about 5 percent 
to 6 percent per year, excluding swiftly developing China and India. Even 
sub-Saharan Africa has grown by more than 4 percent annually over the past five 
years. 
<P>But the evaluation group study found that growth has rarely been 
sustained, exposing the most vulnerable people  --  the rural poor  --  to 
volatile shifts in their economic fortunes. Only two in five of the countries 
that borrowed from the World Bank saw per capita incomes rise continuously from 
2000 to 2005, the study reported, and only one in five saw increases for the 
full decade from 1995 to 2005. 
<P>The study emphasized that economic growth is, by itself, no fix: How the 
gains are distributed is just as important. In China, Romania, Sri Lanka and 
many Latin American countries, swiftly expanding economies have improved 
incomes for many, but the benefits have been limited by a simultaneous increase 
in economic inequality, putting the spoils into the hands of the rich and not 
enough into poor households, the study concludes. 

<P>In Georgia, the bank has helped foster growth by lending in support of the 
oil industry, but this has created few jobs, so the impact on poverty has been 
negligible, the study found. Brazil, on the other hand, has seen little growth 
--  but significant advances against poverty because wealth has been 
distributed more evenly. 
<P>"For a sustained reduction in poverty over a period of time, it really 
pays to worry about both growth and distribution," said Vinod Thomas, 
director-general of the Independent Evaluation Group. "It has been a mistaken 
notion that you can grow first and worry about the distribution later." 
<P>Overall, between 1990 and 2002 the percentage of the world's people who 
subsist on less than one dollar per day declined from 28 percent to 19 percent, 
according to World Bank research. By the bank's reckoning, 1.1 billion people 
were subsisting at that level in 2001. 
<P>"The sheer numbers of people living under the $1 a day definition of 
poverty has been stubbornly high," Thomas said.
