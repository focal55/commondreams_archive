<p>Tensions rose after supporters of leftist Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador and conservative Felipe Calderon staged rival street celebrations, ignoring an official announcement that Sunday's race was too close to call.</p>

A partial count of results issued early Monday, but which authorities had yet to certify, gave a razor-thin edge to Calderon.</p>
<p>Before the preliminary results were posted, the leftist candidate claimed to have won by at least half a million votes. "This is irreversible," said Lopez Obrador, a former Mexico City mayor who champions the cause of the millions of impoverished Mexicans.</p>
<p>"We will demonstrate our triumph," he told thousands of jubilant supporters in the capital's historic Zocalo square, who also celebrated the victory of his Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD) in the capital's mayoral race.</p>
<p>Conservative Felipe Calderon, of the ruling National Action Party (PAN), also claimed victory. "We have won the presidential elections," he said late Sunday.</p>
<p>Results posted by the electoral institute early Monday showed that with 90 percent of the polling stations counted, Calderon had almost 37 percent, 1.15 points ahead of his rival. Electoral authorities said they would start certifying the results on Wednesday and would not announce a winner until then.</p>
<p>The cliffhanger was closely followed in Washington, which evidently hoped to see a reversal of the trend that brought several leftist leaders to power in Latin America over the past few years.</p>
<p>But US Ambassador Antonio Garcia stressed the US administration looked forward to working "with whoever is declared the winner."</p>
<p>He joined Mexican authorities in calling for calm, amid fears the deadlock could lead to instability.</p>

<p>Calderon's campaign has likened the leftist candidate to Venezuela's virulently anti-US President Hugo Chavez, and warned he would plunge the country into a ruinous economic crisis.</p>
<p>Analysts generally dismiss the comparison and say that while Lopez Obrador has little interest in foreign policy, he is not hostile to the United States, by far Mexico's largest trading partner.</p>
<p>The former mayor, 52, rejects suggestions his policies would be anything less than democratic, and insists that the reforms he plans would improve the lot of downtrodden.</p>
<p>He says he would finance major job-creating infrastructure projects and hand out financial aid to elderly and handicapped people, as he did when he was mayor of Mexico City from 2000 to 2005.</p>
<p>For his part, the staunchly conservative Calderon, 43, wants to encourage foreign investment and slash corporate taxes in order to boost economic growth.</p>
<p>During his campaign, he portrayed himself as the candidate for economic stability and employment. A lifelong politician, Calderon has served as a lawmaker, PAN party president, and as energy minister in the cabinet of President Vicente Fox.</p>
<p>His rival insists Mexico's wealth is not trickling down to the millions who live on less than two dollars a day and who in many cases risk their lives by crossing the border illegally in search of the American dream.</p>
<p>Mexico's next president, who will take office on December 1, will face formidable challenges in trying to fulfill campaign pledges of battling poverty, corruption, common crime and drug-fueled violence.</p>
<p>He will also be hampered a lack of congressional majority.</p>

<p>Partial results showed the ruling PAN won 34 percent in chamber of Congress, and the PRD 30 percent, with another 26 percent going to the Party of the Institutional Revolution (PRI), which ruled Mexico for 71 years until Fox's 2000 victory.</p>
<p>PRI candidate Roberto Madrazo lagged behind the two presidential front runners.</p>
<p>Projections also showed the PAN won the three gubernatorial elections.</p>
