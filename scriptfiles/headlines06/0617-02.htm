The "Save the Whales" lobby has stirred memories of its 1980s heyday, thwarting Japan's bid to control the world body frustrating its commercial whaling ambitions.
<p>Whaling opponents Australia, the United States, New Zealand, Brazil and Britain led resistance to Tokyo's drive for a simple majority of pro-whaling states in two votes on the International Whaling Commission (IWC).</p>

<p>Their triumph was an eleventh hour surprise, as many activists and ministers voiced dark predictions of a Japanese victory, hours before the IWC annual meeting opened here.</p>
<p>"So far we have managed to dodge the harpoon, but let's see how things go for the rest of the week," said Dr. Joth Singh of the International Fund for Animal Welfare at the IWC annual meeting in this Caribbean state.</p>
<p>Mike Townsley, a Greenpeace spokesman told AFP: "it is clear Japan has failed to take over the IWC."</p>
<p>Tokyo has made repeated bids to lead pro-whaling nations to power in the IWC, but this year, both sides of the argument believed Japan's time had come.</p>
<p>A two-decades-old moratorium on commercial whaling is not under immediate threat -- it needs a 75 percent majority in the IWC to be overturned.</p>
<p>But whaling opponents fear a simple voting majority here would enable Japan to turn the IWC from conservation back into a "whaling club."</p>
<p>Japan argues the moratorium on commercial whaling has been so successful that whaling of certain species can now be carried out without harming whale stocks.</p>
<p>Currently, Japan conducts "scientific whaling" which is permitted by the IWC, along with Iceland. Norway rejects the moratorium entirely. In all around 2,000 whales are taken globally per year.</p>
<p>Ian Campbell, Australia's environment minister said Friday's rearguard action by whaling opponents had pushed the threat to the moratorium "down the line."</p>

<p>"The great victory for whales we have had today so far, is we have raised the levels of understanding of this issue to levels which have probably not been seen since the 1970s." </p>
<p>The demise of Japan's plans was put down to the absence of Togo and Gambia. Sources told AFP both would have been in Japan's camp, but they did not show up in time.</p>
<p>Had they been there, Japan probably would have secured enough votes to take an early grip on the meeting.</p>
<p>As it was, a proposal to introduce secret balloting failed by 33 votes to 30. A second vote to bar the IWC from discussing measures to protect small cetaceans, such as porpoises and small whales was also narrowly defeated -- by 32 votes to 30 with one abstention.</p>
<p>Both items were considered key to Japan's attempt to establish a solid pro-whaling majority on the commission for the first time since the moratorium came into force two decades ago.</p>
<p>Japanese sources said they had not given up hope of carving out a majority for pro-whaling nations on other issues at the five-day conference.</p>
<p>Heated debate is expected on Saturday on its proposal for "normalisation" which Japan's opponents fear is whale hunting, by another name.</p>
<p>In a document obtained by AFP, Japan signaled it would push for a separate meeting of pro-whaling nations to discuss a possible return to commercial whaling outside IWC auspices before the annual meeting next year.</p>
<p>Earlier, Japan warned it could pull out of the organization if there was no progress towards its goals "within a few years."</p>

<p>Japan also hoped to take a grip on the IWC at last year's meeting in South Korea, but several states expected to vote with the pro-whaling bloc did not appear or pay their annual dues so could not vote.</p>
<p>Green campaigners accuse Japan of bribing small, developing states like Cambodia or Mongolia which have little interest in whaling, to join the commission with foreign aid.</p>
<p>They fear a majority for pro-whaling states would allow Japan to chip away the commercial whaling ban and throw environmental groups out of the meeting.</p>
<p>Tokyo denies claims it bribes small states with aid, pointing out that it also supports nations which oppose whaling, such as India and Argentina.</p>
