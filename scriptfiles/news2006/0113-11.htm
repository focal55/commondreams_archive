<p>CAIRO - January 13 - The Suez Canal harbour authorities have 
confirmed with Greenpeace that permission for passage through the 
channel has still not been granted to the French aircraft carrier – the 
Clemenceau.

<p>The 27,000 tonne end-of-life warship, being towed to India by a small 
tugboat and escorted by a French Navy frigate, is currently holding 
position at the approach to the Suez Canal, awaiting the Egyptian 
authorities’ final decision. Two Greenpeace activists have now left the 
Clemenceau, but the environmental organisation will keep track of the 
Clemenceau over the weekend.

<p>Yesterday, the Egyptian authorities demanded to see the appropriate 
documentation for the ship, from both the French and the Indian 
authorities, to prove it is not in violation of the Basel Convention, 
the international treaty preventing the trade in hazardous materials. If 
Egypt does not receive all the required documentation, the convoy will 
be considered illegal, and ordered to return to a French port.

<p>“Due to the high levels of asbestos on board, it is clear that the 
Clemenceau is an illegal export of hazardous waste to India. This 
floating toxic behemoth is a shameful symbol of how developed countries 
are so willing and apparently able to dump their rubbish into the back 
gardens of developing countries,” said Jacob Hartmann, Greenpeace Nordic 
Toxics Campaigner in the Mediterranean. “The Clemenceau must not be 
allowed to go any further. The Egyptian authorities must stand firm and 
refuse the ship entry and demand its return to France.”

<p>The Indian Supreme Court has also barred the ship from its own 
territorial waters until French authorities produce documents proving 
the ship is not breaking international law. The Indian Supreme Court 
will meet on Monday 16 January to further discuss the issue.
