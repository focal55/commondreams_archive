<p>NEW YORK - May 10 - This week, Demos: A  Network for Ideas &amp; Action and the National Voting Rights  Institute (NVRI) announced that they have signed an affiliation  agreement. Longtime allies on national and state election reform  campaigns, the Demos / NVRI collaboration will combine the  strategy and resources of two of the nation's leading public  policy and advocacy organizations. </p>
<p>   Demos, a 6-year-old research and advocacy group with  headquarters in New York City, has been at the forefront of  important election reform policy change since the 2000 elections.  NVRI, based in Boston, is a non-partisan legal center which  recently argued a ground-breaking campaign finance case in front  of the U.S. Supreme Court. Working in tandem, they will be able  to leverage their combined research, advocacy and litigation  efforts to improve America's civic and political systems to  address the challenges of the 21st century. </p>
<p>   &quot;We are thrilled about this affiliation,&quot; said Miles Rapoport,  president of Demos. &quot;We have worked with NVRI on many initiatives  over the years, from implementing fair and solution-oriented  election reform to building a national case for sensible campaign  finance laws, and have found them to be a great partner. Their  goals for America's democratic system couldn't be closer to  ours.&quot; </p>
<p>   Stuart Comstock-Gay, executive director of the National Voting  Rights Institute, added, &quot;This collaboration is a logical step  for both organizations, as we blend NVRI's litigation expertise  with the tremendous analysis and advocacy work of Demos. It will  also allow us to work in tandem on a range of issues related to  American democracy -- from NVRI's historical work on campaign  finance and voting rights, to Demos' national leadership  reforming and enhancing election administration, promoting  sensible voter registration practices and advancing policy for  fair ballot access. This is a win-win.&quot; </p>
<p>   As part of the collaboration, Comstock-Gay will also assume  directorship of Demos' Democracy Program. Former Democracy  Program Director Steve Carbo will move into a senior program  director role, where he will develop new long-range election and  democracy reform projects for the collaboration. NVRI's legal  team of Brenda Wright and Lisa Danetz will expand their work to  encompass a range of reform initiatives. </p>
<p>   The two organizations will also begin exploring new joint  programmatic efforts outside of the election reform field. NVRI  staff will continue to operate from their Boston office, which  will serve as a base for Demos staff working on joint programs  under the collaboration agreement. </p>
