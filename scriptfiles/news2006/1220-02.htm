<p>WASHINGTON - December 20 - "On behalf of the National Parks Conservation Association and its more than 325,000 members, we commend the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board members on their decision to deny the application for a license to build a casino within cannon range of Gettysburg National Military Park. The denial of this application represents the Board's understanding of the significance of our nation's most sacred places-Gettysburg National Military Park.</P>
<P>Clearly, the Gaming Control Board members listened to the public outcry against bringing a casino to Adams County, while at the same time considering how incompatible a casino would be with the remarkable historic significance of Gettysburg. They clearly understand that a casino would be at odds with the family-friendly atmosphere of the town and with the sacred nature of this place of sacrifice and service for our country. </P>
<P>Gettysburg National Military Park already provides a strong economic engine for the region, attracting approximately 1.7 million people each year. According to NPCA's new economic assessment, U.S. National Park System: An Economic Asset at Risk, visitors to the park generate more than $95 million annually in local revenue while supporting nearly 3,000 jobs locally. </P>
<P>We praise the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board for recognizing the importance of protecting the character of this unique town and the memory of all those who fought during the battle at Gettysburg."</P>
