<p>TORONTO - March 15 - Will Colin Powell be arrested? That is 
the question people across Canada are beginning 
to ask as word spreads of his visit to Toronto on March 15.

<p><b>WHAT:</b> "Die-In", "Extraordinary Rendition-in", and 
"Chalk and Awe", to highlight Colin Powell's war crimes
<p><b>WHEN:</b> 5pm, Wednesday, March 15, 2006
<p><b>WHERE:</b> Roy Thomson Hall (King Street, just West of University Ave)
<p><b>WHO:</b> Organized by ACT for the Earth
<p><b>WHY:</b> Colin Powell Lied: 100,000 Died

<p>According to the principal of Universal 
Jurisdiction, some crimes are so egregious they 
can be tried in any court in the world. A case in 
point is the arrest of Augusto Pinochet in the 
UK. According to Wikipedia, "The British House of 
Lords ruled that Pinochet had no right to 
immunity from prosecution as a former head of 
state, and could be put on trial." ACT for the 
Earth contends that the circumstances of Colin 
Powell's visit to Canada are similar enough to 
warrant his arrest. The British medical journal 
the Lancet has estimated that over 100,000 
civilians have been killed by the US occupation of Iraq.

<p>According to a 2004 report from the US House of 
Representatives' Committee on Government Reform, 
"Secretary Powell made 50 misleading statements 
about the threat posed by Iraq in 34 separate 
public statements or appearances." The passage of 
the report pertaining to Colin Powell is included 
below. The full report which also documents 
misinformation from George Bush, Dick Cheney, 
Condoleezza Rice, and Donald Rumsfeld is available upon request.

<p><b>Iraq on the Record: The Bush Administration's Public Statements on Iraq<br>
US House of Representatives Committee on Government Reform, Minority Staff Special Investigations Division<br>
</b>March 16, 2004
<p>Secretary Powell made 50 misleading statements 
about the threat posed by Iraq in
34 separate public statements or appearances.

<p>Of the 50 misleading statements by Secretary 
Powell, 1 claimed that Iraq posed an
urgent threat; 10 exaggerated Iraq's efforts to develop nuclear weapons; 32 overstated Iraq's chemical or biological weapons capacity; and 7 misrepresented Iraq's links to al Qaeda.

<p>Sometimes Secretary Powell used caveats and qualifying language in his public statements. For example, on March 9, 2003, he said, "Well with respect to the aluminum tubes, we still believe the case is out. 
The CIA has done a great deal of
analysis on those tubes. They are not persuaded 
they were just for rockets. And,
in fact, another nation this week, a European nation, came forward with some additional information that still, I think, 
leaves it an open question as to what the
purpose of those tubes was."[124] Secretary Powell's acknowledgement of differences in this example was not an 
unqualified statement that only mentioned
one side of an intelligence debate.

<p>On numerous other occasions, however, Secretary Powell made unconditional statements about the threats posed by Iraq without disclosing the doubts of intelligence officials. Some of the misleading statements he made included the
following:

<p>
<ul>
<li>"Iraq is now concentrating . . . on developing and testing smaller UAVs. . . . UAVs are well suited for dispensing chemical and biological weapons."[125]<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>"The more we wait, the more chance there is for this dictator with clear ties to terrorist groups, including al-Qaida, more time for him to pass a weapon, share a technology, or use these weapons again."[126]<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>"So far, we have found the biological weapons vans that I spoke about when I presented the case to the United Nations on the 5th of February, and there is no doubt in our minds that those vans were designed for only one purpose, and that was to make biological weapons."[127] </li>
</ul>
