<p>WASHINGTON - October 30 - Amidst new reports that  the armed forces are increasing their surveillance of online  usage by military personnel, Servicemembers Legal Defense Network  (SLDN) today cautioned service members to be especially careful  when using the internet or posting information online. </p>
<p>   According to the Associated Press, military officials are now  monitoring &quot;official and unofficial blogs and other Web sites&quot;  and looking at websites military personnel may visit.  &quot;Now  soldiers wishing to blog while deployed are required to register  their sites with their commanding officers, who monitor the sites  quarterly, according to a four-page document of guidelines  published in April 2005 by Multi-National Corps-Iraq,&quot; the AP  said. </p>
<p>   &quot;The military's stepped up surveillance of online activity  also means an increasing risk to lesbian, gay, bisexual and  transgender service members who use online communities,&quot; said  Kathi S. Westcott, deputy director of law for SLDN.  &quot;Service  members must be especially cautious about posting any information  online which reveals their sexual orientation.  While online  communities can be an important communication tool for military  personnel, they can also lead to investigations and dismissals  under 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell.'&quot; </p>
<p>   SLDN has posted guidelines for LGBT military personnel using  online communities at <a href="http://releases.usnewswire.com/redir.asp?ReleaseID=75276&Link=http://www.sldn.org">http://www.sldn.org</a>.  In addition, AP  reports that service members who maintain blogs must now  &quot;register their sites with their commanding officers, who monitor  the sites quarterly.&quot;  Any information related to sexual  orientation on a service member's private blog, SLDN cautioned,  would be grounds for dismissal from the armed forces. </p>
<p>   For more information, and SLDN's guidelines on using the  internet, visit <a href="http://releases.usnewswire.com/redir.asp?ReleaseID=75276&Link=http://www.sldn.org">http://www.sldn.org</a>.
