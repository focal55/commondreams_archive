<p>WASHINGTON - March 14 - Amnesty International  USA (AIUSA) today urged clemency for Patrick Moody, a 39-year-old  man who is scheduled to be executed in North Carolina at 2 a.m.  on Friday, March 17. </p>
<p>   Amnesty International, the world's largest grassroots human  rights organization, has issued a worldwide call to action  regarding Moody's case, mobilizing the public to send appeals to  North Carolina Gov. Michael Easley on Moody's behalf. AIUSA  Executive Director Dr. William F. Schulz has also written Gov.  Easley, urging commutation of Moody's sentence. </p>
<p>   Schulz said: "On behalf of the members of Amnesty  International, I urge you to demonstrate compassion and grant  clemency to Patrick Moody. As an international human rights  organization, Amnesty International opposes the death penalty in  all circumstances without reservation. While we have tremendous  sympathy for the family and friends of Donnie Robbins, capital  punishment only perpetuates the cycle of violence."</p>
<p>   Moody has been diagnosed with an IQ that hovers around North  Carolina's threshold for mental retardation. At his trial,  clinical psychologist Dr. Jerry Wayne Noble diagnosed him with  "attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, borderline  intellectual functioning, alcohol dependence, a mixed personality  disorder, child abuse syndrome, and physical problems resulting  from psychological difficulties."</p>
<p>   Since 2001, North Carolina has barred the execution of those  with mental retardation and other states offer a precedent for  commutation on mental impairment grounds. In July 2004, Indiana  Gov. Joseph Kernan commuted the death sentence of Darnell  Williams, whose IQ was comparable to Moody's. Gov. Kernan  recognized that while Williams' IQ was slightly above the  benchmark used to determine mental retardation (following the  2002 Atkins vs. Virginia decision, which barred the death penalty  for people with mental retardation, but left it to the states to  set the criteria for that condition), "it remains problematic to  confidently place the solemn decision of life or death on a few  percentage points."</p>
<p>   AIUSA is also seriously concerned about the quality of Moody's  legal representation at the trial stage. Moody's current  attorneys allege that his trial counsel failed to properly  investigate mitigating evidence such as his history of severe  psychological problems and sustained child abuse. In contrast,  co-defendant Wanda Robbins, the wife of the victim, received a  life sentence for her role in the crime, even though Moody  reportedly fully cooperated with the police investigation. </p>
<p>   The circumstances of Moody's childhood were harrowing. He was  subjected to severe physical abuse and neglect as a child at the  hands of both his father and stepmother. His father beat him with  a board and broke plates over his head in addition to locking him  in his room for up to 18 hours without meals. </p>
<p>   AIUSA urges Gov. Easley to heed the growing call for a death  penalty moratorium in North Carolina. Nearly 1,100 resolutions  calling for a moratorium have been passed statewide, prompted by  concerns about the fairness and reliability of the death penalty.  Some of the major North Carolina newspapers have also carried  editorials supporting such a moratorium. </p>
<p>   Local death penalty abolition activists plan several events on  Thursday, March 16, including a daytime vigil from noon to 1 p.m.  at the State Capitol, a prayer service at 7:30 p.m. at Pullen  Memorial Baptist Church in Raleigh, a solemn procession at 8:30  p.m. from the church to the prison, and a nighttime vigil until  the scheduled execution time of 2 a.m., Friday, March 17.</p>
