HELENA, Montana - June 7 - All over America, people 
today are working longer hours for lower wages then they were twenty years ago. 
As the wages of American workers stagnate, state governments are eyeing new 
policy options to augment wages. &nbsp; 
<P class=MsoNormal>The Progressive States Network recently compiled a range a 
new report of solutions considered around the country to improve workers&#8217; 
earnings.</P>
<P class=MsoNormal>Across the country, states are increasing their minimum 
wages. These moves are critical, but they&#8217;re only a first step in making this 
economy work for the middle class again. The summary of state-level policies 
focuses broadly on three strategies: leveraging public dollars to promote higher 
wages, regulations targeting certain employers, and laws to strengthen 
employees&#8217; ability to negotiate better wages.</P>
<P class=MsoNormal>&#8220;Policies to raise wages should be a linchpin of progressive 
leadership,&#8221; said Joel Barkin, Executive Director of the Progressive States 
Network. &#8220;<SPAN class=term>Three decades ago, our national leadership began 
losing focus on such policies and the resultant collapse of wage standards has 
undermined support for progressive leaders during that time. State leaders have 
begun reversing that decline&nbsp;and we now have&nbsp;a&nbsp;range of policy 
options&nbsp;to help raise wages for working families and restore the American 
Dream so that the next generation will be better off than our own</SPAN>&#8221; </P>
