<p>WASHINGTON - July 24 - Candidates from the Green Party's 'Peace Slate' will be featured during the party's 2006 annual national meeting in Tucson Arizona, from Thursday, July 27 to Sunday, July 30.

<p>Hosted by the Pima County Green Party and titled "El Futuro es Verde / The Future is Green," the meeting will take place at the Historic YWCA Building, four blocks from the University of Arizona.

<p>"Greens are running aggressive campaigns for the U.S. House and Senate this year, and are challenging Democrats and Republicans in Congress on their support for the Iraq War and for the Bush Administration's disastrous Middle East policies," said Steve Kramer, co-chair of the Green Party of the United States.

<p>"Greens have called for immediate withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq. Our Peace Slate represents the wishes of the majority of Americans, who want a quick end to the Iraq occupation. Our message in 2006 is this: a vote for the candidates of the two war parties -- Democratic and Republican -- is a vote for war. If you oppose the war on Iraq, vote Green," Mr. Kramer added.

<p>Members of the press are encouraged to cover the meeting. Reporters attending the meeting can visit <http://www.gp.org/forms/media> to fill out the Media Credentials Registration Form, and may also register on site.

<p>Delegates from state Green Parties will participate in the meetings of the party's National Committee, while Green candidates, campaign organizers, and party activists from across the U.S. will attend campaign workshops and organizing meetings.
