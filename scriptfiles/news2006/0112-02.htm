<p>CAIRO - January 12 - Greenpeace activists today intercepted 
and boarded the French aircraft carrier, the Clemenceau, raising the 
stakes in the international row over the decommissioning of the 
Clemenceau, which has been sent to India for decommissioning despite 
widespread outrage at the high levels of asbestos and other hazardous 
materials it contains.

<p>At 07:20hrs this morning, two activists boarded the carrier 50 nautical 
miles from the coast of Egypt in international waters. They are 
currently on one of the ship’s masts with banners declaring: ”asbestos 
carrier: stay out of India”.

<p>The Indian Supreme Court Monitoring Committee has already acknowledged 
that the arrival of the Clemenceau in India would be a violation of the 
Basel Convention, the international treaty preventing the trade in 
hazardous materials.

<p>Greenpeace is now calling on Egypt to refuse permission for the 
Clemenceau to enter the Suez Canal and progress further towards its 
final destination of Alang, India.

<p>The Clemenceau has been the subject of intense international debate, as 
the French Government refuses to reconsider its decision to send the 
military aircraft carrier to India without prior decontamination. The 
ship had already been refused entry into Greece, when military personnel 
had to board the ship in the Mediterranean to return it to France.

<p>Greenpeace activists demonstrated against the ship's departure from 
France, with non-violent protests in simultaneously in France and India.

<p>"The Clemenceau presents an immediate danger to the Indian environment 
and to the workers at the Alang ship-breaking yard," said Jacob 
Hartmann, Greenpeace campaigner on board the vessel that halted the 
Clemenceau's progress today. "There is more than sufficient evidence to 
establish that the French Government has failed to decontaminate the 
ship, even to the standards they agreed to, let alone to international 
standards. We simply cannot allow the ship to get any closer to its 
destination. India has spoken, and they do not want this ship!"

<p>In India, the Supreme Court Monitoring Committee proclaimed on 7 January 
that importing the Clemenceau to India would be considered a serious 
violation of the Basel Convention (1), after hearing the testimony of 
asbestos removal experts from officials from Technopure: the company 
originally contracted by the French Government to decontaminate the 
ship, who stated that at least 500 tonnes of asbestos still remain 
onboard. (2)

<p>Yesterday, in France, Greenpeace and the Ban Asbestos Network started 
court proceedings to remove the confidentiality clause from the contract 
on asbestos removal from the Clemenceau, so that details regarding toxic 
substances onboard may be revealed. The Court is expected to rule today.

<p>"France has repeatedly tried to evade its responsibility regarding the 
Clemenceau," said Jim Puckett of the Basel Action Network. "Their 
standards for handling asbestos are amongst the highest in the world. 
But instead of investing in safe removal and disposal of the asbestos on 
the Clemenceau, they are trying to dupe the Indian Government, and dump 
their toxic wastes onto the poorest of the poor of the world. This is 
absolutely reprehensible; certainly not the kind of attitude one would 
expect of a supposedly civilised nation!"

<p><b>Greenpeace is demanding that:
</b>
<p>1. The French Government agrees to take back the Clemenceau and 
decontaminate it thoroughly before allowing it to leave Europe<p> 2. The Indian Government refuses to allow the Clemenceau permission to 
arrive in India as long as the ship is not thoroughly decontaminated. <p>3. The Egyptian Government upholds its commitment to the Basel 
Convention, and refuses permission for the Clemenceau to transit through 
Egypt or to enter the Suez Canal and head further towards India until 
the Basel obligations are fulfilled (3)

<p>Greenpeace is an independent campaigning organisation that uses 
non-violent creative confrontation to expose global environmental 
problems to force solutions that are essential to a green and peaceful 
future.

<p><b>Notes to editor</b>
<p>1. This means that at least 80% of the asbestos amount is still onboard. 
France claims that 115 tonnes of asbestos has been removed. Technopure 
claims that at least 500 tonnes is still onboard. This means that at 
least 615 tonnes of asbestos were onboard the Clemenceau originally. <p>2. As per decision VII/26 taken at the COP7 meeting of the Basel 
Convention, end-of-life ships are considered 'waste' and it is 
irrelevant that the Clemenceau is a ‘war ship.
<p>3. Egypt has already officially said that it would uphold the Basel 
convention for ships heading for breaking yards going through the canal. 
Amongst other things, Egypt has stated that prior notification 
procedures should be implemented when such ships transit through the 
Suez Canal. Failing compliance with those requirements, Egypt - as a 
party to the convention - shall consider such a crossing an illegal one 
in line with the Basel convention provisions.
