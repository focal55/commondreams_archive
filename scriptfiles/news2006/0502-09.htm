<p>WASHINGTON - May 2 - <SPAN 
            class=published-content-body>On April 10, <SPAN 
            class=media_outlet>Washington Post</SPAN> columnist and deputy 
            editorial page editor Jackson Diehl penned a <A title="" 
            href="http://www.democracyinaction.org/dia/track.jsp?key=117169376&amp;url_num=16&amp;url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/04/09/AR2006040901102.html" 
            target=_blank>column</A> arguing that Venezuelan president Hugo 
            Chavez is not very popular and has little democratic legitimacy. 
            FAIR sent the following letter to Diehl on April 18, questioning the 
            accuracy of his comments and his overall thesis.<BR><BR>FAIR's 
            letter has so far received no response. If you would like to see 
            Diehl respond to questions of accuracy raised by FAIR, you can

            18, 2005 <BR><BR>Jackson Diehl<BR>The Washington Post<BR><BR>Dear 
            Jackson Diehl:<BR><BR>In your column, "In Venezuela, Locking Up the 
            Vote" (4/10/06), you write that Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez 
            "has never enjoyed overwhelming support in Venezuela," adding, "his 
            ratings have mostly fluctuated a few points above and below 50 
            percent."<BR><BR>While the term "overwhelming support" may be 
            somewhat subjective, Chavez has won three elections with 59 percent 
            or more of the popular vote. In the U.S. context, such winning 
            percentages would be considered landslides, comparable to Ronald 
            Reagan&#8217;s win with 59 percent of the vote over Walter Mondale in 
            1984. <BR><BR>What is less subjective is the record on Hugo Chavez&#8217;s 
            approval ratings. A recent report in your own paper (<A title="" 
            href="http://www.democracyinaction.org/dia/track.jsp?key=117169376&amp;url_num=17&amp;url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/12/04/AR2005120400969.html" 
            target=_blank>12/5/05</A>) pegged Chavez's support at 68 percent, as 
            measured by the opposition Venezuelan polling firm Datanalisis. In 
            May 2005, Datanalisis <A title="" 
            href="http://www.democracyinaction.org/dia/track.jsp?key=117169376&amp;url_num=18&amp;url=http://www.angus-reid.com/polls/index.cfm/fuseaction/viewItem/itemID/7103" 
            target=_blank>reported</A> his support at 71 percent. 
            <BR><BR>According to a <A title="" 
            href="http://www.democracyinaction.org/dia/track.jsp?key=117169376&amp;url_num=19&amp;url=http://www.angus-reid.com/polls/index.cfm/fuseaction/viewItem/itemID/11528" 
            target=_blank>Venezuelan Institute for Data Analysis poll</A> 
            published last week, 60 percent of respondents characterized 
            Chavez's presidential performance as either excellent (18 percent) 
            or good (42 percent). Only 16 percent rated Chavez as "average to 
            bad" or worse.<BR><BR>A <A title="" 
            href="http://www.democracyinaction.org/dia/track.jsp?key=117169376&amp;url_num=20&amp;url=http://www.angus-reid.com/polls/index.cfm/fuseaction/viewItem/itemID/10961" 
            target=_blank>February 2006 poll</A> by North American Opinion 
            Research Inc. found 66 percent of Venezuelan respondents saying they 
            would vote for Chavez in the election later this year--more than 
            four times the number who say they would vote for all other 
            candidates combined. And on a related issue, the Chilean polling 
            firm Latinobarómetro <A title="" 
            href="http://www.democracyinaction.org/dia/track.jsp?key=117169376&amp;url_num=21&amp;url=http://www.veninfo.org/downloads/Latinobar.htm" 
            target=_blank>found</A> more people in Venezuela considered their 
            country "totally democratic" than in any other nation in Latin 
            America.<BR><BR>In light of this polling data, we are curious as to 
            how you would justify your assertion that Chavez's "ratings have 
            mostly fluctuated a few points above and below 50 percent." It's a 
            claim that cries out for either explanation or 
            correction.<BR><BR>Sincerely,<BR>Steve Rendall<BR>Senior 
            Analyst<BR>FAIR</SPAN><!-- #EndEditable -->
