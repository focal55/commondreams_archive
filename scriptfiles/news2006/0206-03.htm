<p>WASHINGTON - February 6 -  International agency  Oxfam America welcomed today's announcement that the President's  budget calls for reform of agricultural subsidies and food aid in  the Fiscal Year 2007 Budget request, but expressed disappointment  over cuts in core foreign aid funding. </p>
<p>   &quot;The President's budget calls for stricter agricultural  payment caps is an important reform of an outdated agricultural  subsidy program is rife with abuse and loopholes and hurts small  farmers here and abroad,&quot; said Raymond C. Offenheiser, president  of Oxfam America. &quot;The US government spends billion of dollars  each year on farm payments that are heavily concentrated in  large-scale commercial operations, distorting international  markets and causing controversy and unfairness in global trade.&quot; </p>
<p>   Although the subsidy program was originally created during the  Great Depression as a safety net for farmers, the system has  evolved into a program that benefits those already with an  advantage, encourages overproduction and leads to export dumping  and depressed prices. </p>
<p>   &quot;Today's proposal signals the Administration's commitment to  reforming trade distorting subsidies,&quot; continued Offenheiser.  &quot;The ball is squarely in Congress' court to deliver a fair and  sustainable farm program, not just for the US but for the world.&quot; </p>
<p>   Oxfam also welcomed the President's proposal to make food aid  funds available as cash contributions to make emergency  assistance faster, cheaper and more appropriate.  Shipping U.S.  commodities can cost a lot more and can take months to reach  those in need. In a world where more than 850 million people are  chronically hungry, food aid is vitally important to humanitarian  activities. However, restricting food aid to in-kind donations  limits the effectiveness of the U.S. food aid program. </p>
<p>   &quot;Humanitarian responders need to have flexibility to respond  to needs on the ground by the fastest and most cost-efficient  means possible, be it in-kind or locally purchased food aid,&quot;  said Offenheiser. &quot;Having cash contributions available for local  or regional purchases could increase the speed and volume of food  available to address a crisis and would enable us to feed many  more people.&quot; </p>
<p>   The President also requested an additional $18 billion for  rebuilding the Gulf Coast through a supplemental to the FY2007  budget. With nearly 200,000 homes damaged in Hurricanes Katrina  and Rita, the scale of the devastation dwarfs the resources  homeowners and insurance companies have to make it right. To  date, the generosity of federal support has not been equal to the  severity of the crisis. The federal government must invest in  housing solutions if we want to see the return of these vibrant  American communities. </p>
<p>   &quot;An additional $18 billion for rebuilding the Gulf Coast is  welcome news as continued financial support from the federal  government is critical if the region is to have hope of  recovery,&quot; said Offenheiser. &quot;However, the details of the plan  for spending these funds will reveal if the Administration is  committed to addressing the vast and urgent housing needs on the  hurricane-devastated region.&quot; </p>
<p>   Although the President's budget recommends increases in  Refugee and Migration Assistance and the Millennium Challenge  Account, it also recommends cuts in core foreign assistance, such  as Child Survival, Development Assistance and funding to  international organizations. </p>
<p>   &quot;Over his presidency, President Bush has made great strides to  increase foreign aid, so today's announcement of cuts to core  development funding is a big disappointment,&quot; said Offenheiser.  &quot;Although the US is the largest donor in the world, and US  assistance had been on the increase, the US still lags behind  other developed countries in that our contributions are small  compared to the size of our federal budget and economy.&quot;</p>
