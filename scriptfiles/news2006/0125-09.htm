<p>WASHINGTON - January 25 - Following is a memo  from Media Matters for America:</p>
<p>   In the past three days, numerous media outlets have -- without  challenge -- cited Gen. Michael V. Hayden's January 23 claim that  the Bush administration's decision to bypass the Foreign  Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) court to monitor domestic  phone conversations is legal because the program has targeted  only phone calls that the National Security Agency (NSA) has a  "reasonable basis to believe involve Al Qaeda or one of its  affiliates." Some media have repeated the more specific claim by  Hayden, a deputy director for national intelligence and former  head of the NSA, that the program is legal because the Fourth  Amendment requires that the government have only a "reasonable  basis" for the surveillance, rather than meet the stricter  "probable cause" standard required for a FISA warrant.</p>
<p>   But as attorney and blogger Glenn Greenwald noted on January  24, even as the administration was already bypassing FISA in  2002, the Justice Department issued a statement opposing proposed  legislation by Sen. Mike DeWine (R-OH) to loosen the standard for  such surveillance under FISA from "probable cause" to "reasonable  basis." The administration argued in the statement that lowering  the standard was likely unnecessary and possibly  unconstitutional. In light of this revelation, which contradicts  1) Hayden's suggestion that the stricter "probable cause"  requirement under FISA was inhibiting crucial intelligence  gathering and 2) the administration's claim that Congress had  tacitly authorized the administration's circumvention of FISA in  conducting its secret surveillance program, will the media  outlets that repeated Hayden's defense of the program's legality  under the Fourth Amendment now report the facts undermining that  defense?</p>
<p>   Media Matters' full report on the 2002 Justice Department  statement and the significant contradictions in the Bush  administration's defense of warrantless domestic wiretapping can  be found here: <a href="http://releases.usnewswire.com/redir.asp?ReleaseID=59766&Link=http://mediamatters.org/items/200601250001">http://mediamatters.org/items/200601250001</a></p>
