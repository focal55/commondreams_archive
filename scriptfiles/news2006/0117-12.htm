<p>WASHINGTON - January 17 - Protest Targets Norquist's Wednesday Group Meeting Where  Conservatives, Corporate Lobbyists Enforce &quot;K Street Project&quot;  Despite Roiling Scandal. 
<p>   Hundreds of people will gather outside the Wednesday group  meeting of conservative activists tomorrow morning to protest  corruption in Washington at a rally sponsored by the Campaign for  America's Future, MoveOn.org Political Action and the Public  Campaign Action Fund. </p>
<p>   The Wednesday group is hosted by Grover Norquist, a compatriot  of Rep. Tom DeLay, R-Texas, and notorious lobbyist Jack Abramoff.  Norquist helped create the &quot;K Street Project&quot; to coordinate  activity between corporate lobbyists and conservative  policymakers to secure passage of legislation for their clients. </p>
<p>   The Campaign for America's Future and the Public Campaign  Action Fund joined forces last week to unveil an ad campaign  targeting Rep. DeLay and Rep. Bob Ney, R-Ohio, for their central  roles in one of the worst congressional corruption scandals ever.  Rep. Ney resigned his chairmanship of the House Administration  Committee after the ads started airing and Rep. DeLay threatened  to sue any station that continued to run ads about him. The  groups are fighting back to re-air the ads. </p>
<p>   WHAT: Protest Against Conservative Corruption Outside &quot;K  Street Project&quot; </p>
<p>   WHEN: Wednesday, Jan. 18, 2006, at 10 a.m. </p>
<p>   WHERE: Sidewalk outside Americans for Tax Reform, 1920 L  Street, NW, Washington, D.C. </p>
<p>   PARTICIPANTS: Hundreds of protestors holding &quot;Stop Corruption&quot;  signs as conservative operatives and lobbyists arrive to meet. </p>
