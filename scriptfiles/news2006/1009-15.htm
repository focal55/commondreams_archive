<p>WASHINGTON - October 9 - <p>   On Monday, Oct. 9, Military Families from New Jersey will hold  a press conference to highlight the questions that they have  asked State Sen. Tom Kean, Jr. about the war in Iraq and about  our troops -- questions that he has, to date, refused to answer.</p>

<p>   The press conference will be  at 3 p.m. Monday, Oct. 9, at the  National Guard Armory, Teaneck Road and Liberty Road, Teaneck,  N.J.</p>
<p>   On Aug. 14, four members of Military Families Speak Out -  Bergen County Chapter met with Kean to ask him specific questions  about the war in Iraq and U.S. troops who were sent to fight  there. Three of these families have loved ones currently deployed  to Iraq, one has a son who will soon deploy. Kean answered some  of the groups' questions, and agreed to answer the rest and put  all of his answers in writing. On Aug. 28, his staff informed the  group that Kean would not supply them with written answers to  their questions.</p>
<p>   The questions that Kean failed to answer involve whether or  not he would serve in the military, the logic behind troops  remaining in Iraq, a timetable for withdrawal of troops from Iraq  and care for returning veterans.</p>
<p>   At a press briefing on Oct. 6 in Manhattan, Jo Ann Sohl, a  military mother and member of Military Families Speak Out -  Bergen County, again asked Kean to answer the group's questions.  A member of Kean's staff rudely intervened, preventing her from  communicating with the State Senator, who then left the room  without responding.</p>
<p>   &quot;The answers to our questions concern the life or death of our  loved ones as well as all our troops and the people of Iraq,&quot;  stated Sohl, whose son and only child was injured in Iraq and  most recently had his tour of duty there extended. &quot;More than  2,744 U.S. troops have been killed -- 30 service men and women in  the first eight days of October,&quot; Sohl continued. &quot;Tens of  thousands of Iraq children, women and men have died as a result  of this war. Over 20,687 U.S. troops have suffered serious  injuries. Each one of these people is someone's child, someone's  loved one.&quot;</p>

<p>   &quot;The questions we are asking are critical to the troops and  their families who bear the human cost of the war, but they also  affect every citizen of this state,&quot; said Paula Rogovin, whose  son will soon deploy to Iraq. &quot;With each passing day the human  and financial costs of this war escalate. The stakes are too high  (and too precious) to allow those who are seeking to represent us  to be unwilling or unable to provide answers to these critical  questions.&quot;</p>
<p>   Military Families Speak Out members from New Jersey are also  asking Kean to reconsider his response to one of the questions he  did answer on Aug. 14. Kean was asked, on behalf of MFSO member  John Fenton from Little Ferry, whether or not he has been to  Bethesda Naval Hospital or other military hospitals to visit  wounded troops. Fenton's son Matthew, a Marine, died in Bethesda  on May 6 of wounds he received in Iraq. Kean responded that  candidates for office are not allowed to visit troops in these  hospitals. &quot;Officials in these hospitals have said that this is  absolutely not the case,&quot; said Sohl. &quot;We think Mr. Kean needs to  acknowledge that he can indeed visit wounded troops -- not  campaign there, mind you -- but has, in fact, chosen not to.&quot;</p>
