<p>WASHINGTON - September 21 - Consumers Union,  publisher of Consumer Reports magazine, urges the Consumer  Product Safety Commission (CPSC), Congress, and States to pursue  prohibiting the use of all-terrain vehicles (ATVs) by children 16  years old and younger and to offer States incentives to improve  the safety of ATV use. The announcement of the CPSC's education  program to highlight the hazards of ATV's is commended, but it is  not enough to prevent children from dying on these dangerous  vehicles.   </p>
<p>   &quot;Self regulation by the ATV industry has led to one thing-an  increase in injuries and deaths,&quot; said Janell Mayo Duncan, senior  counsel for Consumers Union.  &quot;Congress, the CPSC, and States  need to take more comprehensive action to make all-terrain  vehicle use safer.  &quot;Recreation should not be life-threatening,&quot;  she added.  </p>
<p>   ATV use killed an estimated 740 and seriously injured more  than 125,000 people in 2003 alone.  Nearly one-third of those  were children under age 16.  The statistics show an upward trend  in ATV injuries and deaths since restrictions on manufacturers  under a consent decree expired.</p>
<p>   Consumers Union, a long-time supporter for reform of ATV use,  calls upon:  </p>
<p>   -- The CPSC to (i) ban the class of vehicles designed for  children; (ii) ban three wheeled as well as 2-person vehicles;  (iii) evaluate the dynamics of the ATV crashes that are claiming  so many lives; (iv) develop comprehensive, mandatory safety  standards; and (v) require the redesign ATVs to improve safety,  particularly to prevent rollovers.</p>
<p>   -- Congress to make funds available to the States for  educational and training campaigns, as well as licensing and  helmet requirements and enforcement.</p>
<p>   -- States to (i) ban ATV use on paved roads; (ii) implement  educational and training campaigns, (iii) create and enforce  licensing requirements; and (iv) require appropriate protective  gear including helmets to operate an ATV.</p>
