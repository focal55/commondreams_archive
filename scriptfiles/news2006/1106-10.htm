<p>BRUSSELS - November 6 - <span style="font-family: Arial;" lang="EN-AU">At local police stations all over Europe, anti-nuclear activists will today begin filing official complaints under international humanitarian law to bring governments before the court because of their role in NATO's illegal nuclear weapons strategy. In a joint Bombspotting and Greenpeace initiative the groups call for the removal and dismantlement of the illegal US nuclear weapons deployed in Europe. Greenpeace and Bombspotting are encouraging people to file their own legal complaints and have placed information needed to make a complaint on the Internet[1] . </span></p>
<span style="font-family: Arial;" lang="EN-AU">480</span><span class="Voetnootteken"><span style="font-family: Arial;" lang="EN-US">[2]</span></span><span style="font-family: Arial;" lang="EN-AU"> US NATO
nuclear weapons remain in Europe in Germany, Belgium, Italy, the Netherlands,
Turkey and the UK under NATO. The complaints to be filed against governments by
individuals from groups in the UK, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Portugal and
Turkey demand the enforcement of international humanitarian law. The
International Court of Justice indicated in its Advisory Opinion from 1996 the
rules of international law applying to nuclear weapons. The use or threat of
nuclear weapons is contrary to these rules of international law, because nuclear
weapons cause<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>unnecessary suffering
and are indiscriminate.</span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;" lang="EN-AU"> </span><span style="font-family: Arial;" lang="EN-US">The
complaint points out the complicity of governments in NATO nuclear
decision-making and consequent responsibility and requests that the police take
the relevant national judicial route to hold governments accountable to the
rules of international law.<br>
</span>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right: 15.85pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;" lang="EN-US">Last month NATO condemned North Korea's nuclear test as “an extremely
serious threat to peace and security in the world.” At the same time NATO
continues to maintain these weapons in Europe.” Everyday that US nuclear
weapons remain in Europe and, that NATO maintains plans for their use,
international law is being broken. While we support the criticism of North
Korea in developing nuclear weapons the position of NATO is severely undermined
by their own flagrant disregard for the law. NATO should put its own nuclear
house in order and eliminate its own extremely serious threat to peace and
security,” said Bombspotting campaigner Roel Stynen.<br>
</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right: 15.85pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;" lang="EN-US">Donna Mattfield, Disarmament Campaigner at Greenpeace International
added “on 28th and 29th November NATO’s state leaders
will meet in Riga, Latvia, to begin a process to review the mandate of the
Alliance. This is an opportunity for European leaders to meet their own
obligation to disarm the world of nuclear weapons and to do what the majority
of people in Europe want <span class="Voetnootteken">[3]</span> by removing US
nuclear weapons from European soil”.<br>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right: 15.85pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;" lang="EN-US">On 24th November,
a bailiff will bring a summons to end NATO's illegal policy to NATO Secretary
General De Hoop-Scheffer. The summons will remind De Hoop-Scheffer of his
obligations under international law.</span>
