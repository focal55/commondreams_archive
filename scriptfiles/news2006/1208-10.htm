<p>WASHINGTON - December 8 - The American Civil Liberties Union National Prison Project and 
two Ann Arbor civil rights attorneys, Patricia Streeter and Michael Barnhart, 
today lauded a ruling by a Michigan judge calling for improvements to deficient 
prison health care.&nbsp; 
<P>Michigan prison officials were found in contempt of previous orders to fill 
medical staff vacancies to provide basic care to prisoners.&nbsp; If these 
orders are not followed within the next 120 days, prison officials face a $2 
million fine.&nbsp; Judge Richard Alan Enslen further ordered that an office for 
an independent monitor must be put in place on prison grounds to oversee 
improvements to medical care.</P>
<P>&#8220;We are especially pleased with the court&#8217;s decision to order a monitoring 
office,&#8221; said Elizabeth Alexander, director of the ACLU National Prison 
Project.&nbsp; &#8220;Prison health care providers are not capable of running a 
functional program on their own.&#8221;</P>
<P>In issuing his opinion, Judge Enslen expressed his deep dissatisfaction with 
the prison health care system in Michigan.&nbsp; &#8220;To explain this matter in the 
vernacular, a prisoner who receives a sentence of 2-10 years, deserves to do 
2-10 years,&#8221; he wrote.&nbsp; &#8220;What he does not deserve is a de facto and 
unauthorized death penalty at the hands of a callous and dysfunctional health 
care system that regularly fails to treat life-threatening illness.&#8221;</P>
<P>Judge Enslen&#8217;s opinion cites the case of a prisoner who reported severe chest 
pains and was scheduled for a 30-day consult.&nbsp; Apparently lucky to have 
survived, the prisoner was seen more than 30 days later by medical staff and 
found to have 70 percent blockage of the left coronary artery with narrowing in 
the right coronary artery as well.</P>
<P>The opinion details another case of a prisoner who reported a potentially 
cancerous mole in June 2005.&nbsp; Due to insufficient follow up, it was not 
removed until January 2006, when it was a bleeding, black-red mass determined to 
be malignant melanoma.&nbsp; A biopsy in April 2006 showed that the cancer had 
spread during the time this prisoner was not treated.</P>
<P>Judge Enslen noted that deficiencies in the health care system also 
contributed to the August 2006 death of a mentally ill prisoner, whom the ACLU 
calls &#8220;TS&#8221; due to a court order.&nbsp; An autopsy released last month reported 
that TS died from &#8220;hyperthermia and complications&#8221; four days after he was put in 
restraints during a heat wave.</P>
<P>Attorney Patricia Streeter welcomed the court&#8217;s ruling.&nbsp; &#8220;Improvements 
to the Michigan prison health care system are long overdue,&#8221; she said.&nbsp; 
&#8220;Deficient medical care has already caused too many deaths.&#8221;</P>
<P>In another significant development this week, the Michigan Department of 
Corrections announced that the National Commission on Correctional Health Care 
would conduct the independent review of prison health care ordered by Governor 
Jennifer Granholm.&nbsp; The current president of the National Commission on 
Correctional Health Care is also the director of medical services for the 
Michigan Department of Corrections.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&#8220;This appears to be a direct conflict of interest,&#8221; said the ACLU&#8217;s 
Alexander.&nbsp; &#8220;We question whether oversight will come from a review done by 
the very person who runs the failing program.&#8221;</P>
<P>Judge Enslen&#8217;s order and opinion, which were issued late yesterday, can be 
found online at:&nbsp; <A class=noline_blue href="http://www.aclu.org/prison/medical/27644lgl20061207.html">www.aclu.org/prison/medical/27644lgl20061207.html</A><!-- #EndEditable -->
