<p>BOSTON - August 24 - One year after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita devastated the Gulf  region, Farm Aid reports that area farmers are not giving up.  Family farmers are finding new ways to get their products to  market and to rebuild their generations-old farms.
<p>   Farm Aid has been working with family farmers since August  2005 to help rebuild homes, barns, and pastures, and to provide  hay to starving livestock. In the past year, the organization has  witnessed incredible determination and resilience as farm  families have developed new connections in the Delta and across  the country to rebuild their markets. Two of these extraordinary  family farmers are available to talk about their lives and  livelihoods since the hurricanes and their efforts to rebuild  their homes, farms and communities.</p>
<p>   -- Ben Burkett is an African American farmer in southern  Mississippi whose property was damaged by the hurricanes. The  Burkett farm suffered major crop losses and the markets where he  sold the farm's crops - the New Orleans Farmers Market and the  Casino Market in Biloxi - were destroyed. In the year since  Katrina, Ben has bounced back, helping to develop new markets in  Biloxi and New Orleans with the support of the Federation of  Southern Cooperatives and Farm Aid. He is participating in those  markets and working with other farmers in the region to develop  cooperatives to improve their economic situation. While Ben has  struggled to rebuild his farm, he's not stopped helping his  neighbors and colleagues to rebuild theirs.</p>
<p>   -- Jim Core is an organic vegetable producer out of Louisiana  who suffered property damage and crop loss during Katrina.  He  was selling produce into the New Orleans market which was  destroyed. After being unable to access federal assistance, Jim  called the Farm Aid emergency hotline for support and Farm Aid  responded by providing Jim with direct emergency assistance and  by connecting him to other farmers in and farm support groups in  the area. Jim is recovering and has identified new markets in the  region to sell his produce as well as working to set up new  markets in Jefferson Parish. He is also reaching out to  restaurants in New Orleans and has created a strong market there.</p>
