<P>CHICAGO - February 28 - America's Second  Harvest-The Nation's Food Bank Network today awarded Bill  Bolling, executive director of the Atlanta Community Food Bank,  the 2006 Dick Goebel Public Service Award for outstanding  commitment to ending hunger in his community and across the  country.  Bolling accepted the award at the 2006 National Anti- Hunger Policy Conference, a gathering in Washington, D.C. of more  than 450 anti-hunger advocates, sponsored by America's Second  Harvest and the Food Research Action Center (FRAC).</p>
<p>   &quot;Bill Bolling personifies the spirit of public and community  service,&quot; said Robert Forney, president and chief executive  officer of America's Second Harvest.  &quot;Bill has been an  extraordinary leader for many years in efforts to end hunger in  the Atlanta area, and he has been a tireless advocate on behalf  of national public policies that help individuals and families in  need.  His enthusiasm, kindness and generosity are extraordinary  assets to the America's Second Harvest Network and hungry people  nationwide.&quot;  </p>
<p>   Bolling is the founder of the Atlanta Community Food Bank and  has served as its executive director since 1979.  In this  capacity he oversees the distribution of more than 18 million  pounds of good but unmarketable food each year through nearly 800  local and regional nonprofit organizations that feed the hungry.   Prior to his association with the Food Bank, he served as  director of community ministries for St. Luke's Episcopal Church  in Atlanta.</p>
<p>   He currently serves on Atlanta Mayor Shirley Franklin's  Regional Commission on Homelessness, the Nonprofit Advisory  Committee of the Andrew Young School at Georgia State University  and the Advisory Boards of TechBridge and Hands On Atlanta.  He  is founder of the Atlanta Housing Forum, begun in 1988, and  continues to serve as moderator of the Regional Housing Forum.</p>
<p>   In 2005, Bolling helped plan and coordinate the first-ever  Interfaith Convocation held at the Washington National Cathedral  in recognition of National Hunger Awareness Day. Over 37 heads of  faith from Jewish, Christian, Muslim, Buddhist and Native  American traditions and 1,500 attendees participated in this  service calling for an end to hunger in our lifetime.</p>
<p>   The Dick Goebel Public Service Award was created in 2001 in  honor of the Reverend Richard (Dick) Goebel for his many years of  public service on behalf of hungry Americans.  As founder and  executive director of the Second Harvest St. Paul Food Bank in  St. Paul, Minn. (now Second Harvest Heartland), Dick's dedicated  service left a lasting legacy.  Recipients of the Dick Goebel  Public Service Award exemplify service to their communities,  extensive public policy advocacy, and tireless enthusiasm and  creativity in developing solutions to ending hunger both locally  and nationally.   </p>
