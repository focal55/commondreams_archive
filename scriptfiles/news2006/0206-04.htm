<p>WASHINGTON - February 6 - Today is the opening of the global tobacco treaty's first Conference of the Parties (COP), a two-week meeting where governments will decide on critical details for the enforcement of the world's first corporate accountability treaty. Formally known as the World Health Organization (WHO) Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC), the treaty is designed to reverse the global tobacco epidemic, which is projected to claim 10 million lives per year by 2030, with 70% of deaths occurring in the Global South. 113 countries ratified the treaty in time to vote at the first COP. </P>
<P>Developing countries that championed a strong, enforceable treaty throughout negotiations are expected to push for rigorous enforcement and to stand firm in their resistance to powerful tobacco industry interference. Health officials expect the global tobacco treaty to save millions of lives by changing the way giant tobacco corporations operate around the world. </P>
<P>"Countries like Thailand and South Africa are setting the pace for strong enforcement of the global tobacco treaty. Thailand has recently closed the point-of-sale loophole in its tobacco advertising ban and South Africa refused to allow BAT to sponsor the 2010 soccer World Cup, in accordance with its ban on tobacco promotion and sponsorship," explains Corporate Accountability International Executive Director Kathryn Mulvey. "Still, through each phase of the treaty process, Big Tobacco comes up with new tricks to try to derail health policies. We will need strong vigilance to the tobacco industry's latest tactics as the Conference of the Parties moves ahead."</P>
<P>Network for Accountability of Tobacco Transnationals (NATT) members have documented cases of Philip Morris/Altria and British American Tobacco interfering in treaty ratification and implementation across the globe. See the <A class="" href="http://www.stopcorporateabuse.org/cms/page1345.cfm" target=_blank>Global Tobacco Treaty Action Guide: Protecting National Health Policies from International Tobacco Industry Interference</A> online for case studies. However, NGOs and health officials remain optimistic about the treaty's enforcement and implementation. </P>
<P>"More than 120 countries, including over 70% of the world's population, have committed to the obligations of the global tobacco treaty," says Muyunda Ililonga of Zambia Consumers Association, a NATT member. "We are confident that the first Conference of the Parties will set up structures to fulfill these commitments, without interference from the tobacco industry or countries that have not ratified the treaty."</P>
<P>There are a few large, influential countries that have not yet ratified the treaty, notably: Indonesia, Russia and United States. International attention was drawn to Indonesia last spring when Philip Morris/Altria took over one of the country's largest cigarette manufacturers. Philip Morris/Altria CEO Louis Camilleri shocked corporate accountability and health advocates in the midst of the acquisition by announcing at the corporation's annual shareholders' meeting that Philip Morris/Altria would continue to do outreach to Ministries of Health. Article 5.3 of the FCTC requires parties to protect their national health policies from interference by the tobacco industry.</P>
<P>Two key issues to be decided at this COP are institutional and financial support. Effective implementation of the treaty will rely on full and adequate funding, but with responsibility spread across more than 100 countries, the financial implications for any one country will be limited. The COP will designate a permanent secretariat and determine the frequency of future COPs. On these matters NGOs are urging the COP to keep the secretariat free from influence by non-parties and the tobacco industry, and to recognize that the benefits of funding the global tobacco treaty far outweigh its costs.</P>
