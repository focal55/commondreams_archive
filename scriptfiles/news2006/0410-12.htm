<p>WASHINGTON  - April 10 - The National Organization for Women applauds the reintroduction 
            of the Freedom of Choice Act by Senator Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) and 
            Representative Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.). In this hostile political 
            climate, an act that codifies "women's right to choose to bear a 
            child or terminate her pregnancy" is crucial to save women's lives. 

<P>This 33rd year of <EM>Roe v. Wade</EM>, the landmark Supreme 
            Court decision that provided constitutional protection for abortion, 
            has been a dire one for women rights. In January, the Senate 
            confirmed a right-wing conservative, Samuel Alito, to replace 
            Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, who in her 20-plus years on the Supreme 
            Court was a consistent vote in favor of <EM>Roe</EM>. Now, with 
            Alito on the bench, constitutional protection for women's 
            reproductive decisions is looking increasingly bleak. </P>
            <P>According to a report by the Alan Guttmacher Institute, 
            legislators in 10 states have introduced measures in 2006 that would 
            directly challenge <EM>Roe v. Wade</EM> by banning virtually all 
            abortions. Under these circumstances, a federal law like the Freedom 
            of Choice Act is necessary to protect women from zealous 
            anti-women's rights politicians acting at the behest of religious 
            and political extremists.</P>
            <P>On behalf of NOW's more than half-million contributing members 
            and women all over the world, I am proud to support the Freedom of 
            Choice Act. FOCA has the potential to save women's lives, health, 
            liberty and privacy, and it serves as a testament that, even in 
            these dangerous times, women's fundamental right to reproductive 
            justice must be of paramount concern.</P>
