<p>WASHINGTON - May 15 - Green candidates running for Congress are picking up support from many voters frustrated by the
          lack of Democratic opposition to the Bush agenda, especially on the invasion and occupation of Iraq.
<p class="navigate">A state-based list of campaigns to watch in the 2006 mid-term elections is appended below.  Other candidates will be
          featured in future releases.</p>
          <p class="navigate">Most of the candidates are currently seeking the nomination of their respective state Green Parties.  In some races, multiple
          candidates are competing for the nomination.&nbsp;</p>

          Garrett, co-chair of the Georgia Green Party and spokesperson for the National Women's Caucus.&nbsp;</p>
