<p>WASHINGTON - November 30 - On the eve of <a href="http://www.worldaidsday.org/" target=_blank>World AIDS Day</a> (Dec. 1), the <a href="http://www.publicintegrity.org/default.aspx" target=_blank>Center for Public Integrity</a> today released "<a href="http://www.publicintegrity.org/aids" target=_blank>Divine Intervention</a>," a year-long investigation into how President Bush's $15 billion initiative for care, treatment and prevention of HIV/AIDS abroad has failed countries struggling with the pandemic.</p>
<p>The special report, the first of its kind to examine the policies, politics and goals of the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (<a href="http://www.pepfar.gov/" target=_blank>PEPFAR</a>), looks at its effects on specific "focus countries," as well as India and Thailand, where the sex-trade industry is driving high rates of infection. Reporters affiliated with the Center's <a href="http://www.publicintegrity.org/icij" target=_blank>International Consortium of Investigative Journalists</a> in Ethiopia, Kenya, Nigeria, Uganda, South Africa, Haiti, India and Thailand found that faith-based ideology – including abstinence – often trumps science in the guise of federal rules, regulations and support of the organizations receiving taxpayer money.</p>
<p>More than three years after PEPFAR's creation, about $8.3 billion has been spent with less than $1 billion going to prevention in the 15 focus countries. Meanwhile, the number of people with HIV continues to rise internationally, with 75 percent infected through sexual intercourse. More than 450 people contracted HIV each hour last year, resulting in more than 4 million new cases.</p>
<p>"The goals and directives established by PEPFAR have stifled HIV/AIDS prevention efforts in countries such as Thailand and Uganda, formally recognized as success stories, and disregarded countries such as Swaziland, Lesotho and Zimbabwe," said Wendell Rawls, Center interim executive director and Divine Intervention project manager. "Sadly, 'compassionate conservatism' seems not to have been the most effective way to prevent the spread of the disease."</p>
<p>Interviews with scores of activists, people living with HIV/AIDS, physicians, health care workers, government officials and academics, and an examination of thousands of pages of incomplete documents also reveal a pattern of contradictory, conflicting and confusing policies.</p>
<p>For Divine Intervention, CPI filed two dozen <a href="http://foia.state.gov/COP.asp" target=_blank>Freedom of Information</a> requests and <a href="http://www.publicintegrity.org/aids/default.aspx?act=methodology" target=_blank>lawsuits</a> against the State Department, Department of Health and Human Services and U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) to access information about PEPAR, which is managed through the <a href="http://www.state.gov/s/gac" target=_blank>Office of the Global AIDS Coordinator</a> (OGAC) at the State Department.</p>
<p>During their investigations, ICIJ reporters encountered PEPFAR officials who couldn't answer basic questions about the programs they oversaw, PEPFAR recipients who were reluctant to criticize their donor out of fear of losing funding and Freedom of Information Act requests that were stalled for months. Requests for interviews and information from OGAC's Washington office were often ignored or canceled, dozens of phone calls and emails never returned, and database information that was provided contained errors.</p>
<p>The report also features extensive in-country <a href="http://www.publicintegrity.org/aids/default.aspx?act=interviews" target=_blank>interviews</a>, <a href="http://www.publicintegrity.org/aids/country.aspx" target=_blank>profiles</a> of all 15 focus countries and a sampling of <a href="http://www.publicintegrity.org/aids/org.aspx" target=_blank>organizations</a> that have received funding, as well as a PEPFAR <a href="http://www.publicintegrity.org/aids/default.aspx?act=glossary" target=_blank>glossary</a>.</p>
<p>Divine Intervention was made possible through grants from the Popplestone Foundation and the <a href="http://www.hewlett.org/Default.htm" target=_blank>William and Flora Hewlett Foundation</a>. Core support for the Center was provided by the <a href="http://www.macfound.org/site/c.lkLXJ8MQKrH/b.855229/k.CC2B/Home.htm" target=_blank>John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation</a>, the <a href="http://www.knightfdn.org/" target=_blank>John S. and James L. Knight Foundation</a>, the <a href="http://www.carnegiefoundation.org/" target=_blank>Carnegie Foundation</a>, the <a href="http://www.whannenberg.org/" target=_blank>Annenberg Foundation</a>, the <a href="http://www.parkfoundation.org/" target=_blank>Park Foundation</a> and the Schumann Center for Media and Democracy.</p><ContentEnd />
