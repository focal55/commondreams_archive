<p>ALBUQUERQUE, New Mexico - August 23 - Yesterday, Herman Cain, a member of Wal-Mart's front group, Working Families for Wal-Mart, wrote an audacious column posted on Townhall.com, a popular conservative opinion website, viciously attacking Democrats and describing Democrats as Hezbollah terrorists.  Specifically, Cain renames Democrats who are calling on Wal-Mart to change into a responsible employer as "Hezbocrats."  In response, WakeUpWalMart.com issued the following statement attributable to Paul Blank, campaign director for the group:</p>
<p>   "Just days after Ambassador Andy Young, the former chair of Wal-Mart’s front group, Working Families for Wal-Mart, was forced to resign because of derogatory statements he made about Jewish-Americans, Korean-Americans, and Arab-Americans in defense of Wal-Mart’s business practices, yet another member of Wal-Mart's front group, Herman Cain, launched a vicious and derogatory attack against Democrats.</p>
<p>   "In the column, posted on TownHall.com, Herman Cain, the former CEO of Godfathers Pizza, and an official Georgia steering committee member of Working Families for Wal-Mart, not only personally attacks Democratic leaders, like Sen. Evan Bayh, Sen. Joe Biden, and New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson, but actually has the nerve to compare them to Hezbollah terrorists. </p>
<p>   "In the column, Cain writes, 'The Hezbocrats, armed with nothing more than Katyusha-grade class warfare rhetoric, descended upon Iowa earlier this month determined to take down Wal-Mart, a company they consider the nation’s largest capitalistic oppressor of the proletariat.' In the column, he clearly describes Democrats, again and again, as analogous to Hezbollah terrorists. </p>
<p>   "Sadly, this is the second time in a week that a member of Wal-Mart's front group, Working Families for Wal-Mart, has used outrageous language to defend this company. In this case, Cain has used the 'terrorist-card' to attack and besmirch the integrity of some of America’s great leaders and it is simply wrong.</p>
<p>   "Herman Cain's column is a disgusting display of how the politics of personal destruction now runs rampant through Wal-Mart's right wing war room. </p>
<p>   "For the good of the country, and Wal-Mart itself, we call on Wal-Mart to immediately and publicly denounce Cain's comments and, in the same manner as Ambassador Young, immediately ask for his resignation from the Wal-Mart group. </p>
<p>   "We also once again call on Wal-Mart to immediately shut down this pointless attack group, end its association with the cadre of right-wing operatives it currently employs under the made up name of Working Families for Wal-Mart, cast aside its misguided political threats against so many Democratic leaders, and realize that only through real positive change will Wal-Mart become a better company." </p>
<p>   A link of the column posted late yesterday is attached below. </p>
