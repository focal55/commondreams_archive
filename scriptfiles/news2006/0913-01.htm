<p>WASHINGTON - September 13 - EMILY's List, the nation's largest grassroots political network and financial resource for women running for elective office, today celebrated primary victories for former State Senator Gabrielle Giffords in Arizona’s 8th Congressional District and Councilwoman Yvette Clarke in New York’s 11th Congressional District.&nbsp;&nbsp; </P><P>“Gabrielle Giffords and Yvette Clarke are rising stars in&nbsp; an exceptional group of stellar pro-choice Democratic women candidates poised to help take back the U.S. House and change the face of power in Washington,” said Ellen R. Malcolm, president of EMILY’s List. “Voters across the country have asked for a change in the direction of our country and it is in this change environment that will propel Democratic women to victory.”&nbsp;&nbsp; </P><P>The political climate is ripe for Democrats to win the 15 seats the party needs to take control of the U.S. House. This state of affairs has been a boon for EMILY's List candidates, resulting in record numbers of qualified pro-choice Democratic women running for Congress in some of the most important races facing Democrats across the country.&nbsp;&nbsp; </P><P>“Gabrielle Giffords stands at the forefront of an unprecedented group of Democratic women candidates who will help decide the future balance of power in Congress,” said Malcolm.&nbsp; “Nearly a third of the most vulnerable Republican seats that represent Democrats’ best opportunities to take back the House are in the capable hands of EMILY's List candidates like Giffords and because of them we look to November with tremendous confidence. Malcolm continued saying, “Giffords’ business know-how paired with her strong background in economic development and experience in local lawmaking will be invaluable to her in Washington, and her presence in Washington will be invaluable to the people of Arizona’s 8th Congressional District.”&nbsp; </P><P>“Yvette Clarke represents the next generation of outstanding women leaders who will bring their much needed talents to Congress,” said Malcolm. Clarke joined fellow EMILY's List candidates Kathy Castor and Betty Sutton in winning a primary for a safe Democratic seat, and is expected to win handily in November.&nbsp; Malcolm continued saying, “Clarke has dedicated her life to the empowerment and betterment of her community by working to improve education, services for our seniors and driving economic development for her constituents. These women will not only increase the ranks of women voices in Congress, they bring urgently needed depth and diversity to the perspectives and strengths of our government.”&nbsp;&nbsp; </P><P>This cycle, EMILY's List is working with more than twice the number of candidates as compared to last cycle.&nbsp; These women are running strong campaigns in some of most competitive and critical races in the country and EMILY's List has stepped up with its most aggressive program of fundraising, campaign services, and field programs driven by groundbreaking micro-targeting to see them to victory.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </P><P>“We also applaud the efforts of Paula Hollinger (MD-03), Ember Reichgott Junge (MN-05) and Nancy Nusbaum (WI-08),” said Malcolm. “Their hard fought campaigns, while ending short of victory, are an inspiration for others and served to widen the path for another generation of women candidates.&nbsp; We know their service and leadership in their communities will continue far into the future and we look forward to their next campaign.”&nbsp; </P><P># # # </P><P>Background: </P><P>Driven by the power of more than 100,000 members across the country, EMILY's List is the largest political action committee in the nation.&nbsp; Since its founding in 1985, EMILY's List has helped elect 61 pro-choice Democratic women to the U.S. House, 11 to the U.S. Senate, and eight governors. In only ten election cycles, EMILY's List has helped elect hundreds of pro-choice Democratic women to federal office, state legislatures, state constitutional offices and other key local offices.</P><P>In the 2006 elections, EMILY's List candidates are competing in some of the most important House races across the country including: </P><P align=center>Vulnerable Republican Seats *</P><P align=center>AZ-08 OPEN (Kolbe) – Gabrielle Giffords<BR>
