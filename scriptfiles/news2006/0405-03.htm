<p>WASHINGTON - April 5 - Win Without War, the coalition of 40 national organizations including MoveOn.org, the National Council of Churches, True Majority, Working Assets, NAACP, and NOW praised GOP House members who today demanded an open debate and vote on the Iraq war in the House of Representatives. At least four GOP members announced that they would sign H. Res 543, the “discharge petition” that will force a debate on the House floor over the objections of House GOP leadership.  They urged their House colleagues to join them.

 

<p>The coalition announced the launching of a national grassroots and media campaign supporting the demand for a House debate and vote on all alternatives to the open ended U.S. military occupation of Iraq. It released radio and print ads that will begin running today in Ohio and Minnesota and a web site to support grassroots campaign actions nation-wide: www.openiraqdebate.org. Tens of thousands of coalition members will urge members of Congress to sign H. Res 543 during the upcoming April recess and flood their offices with phone calls.



<p>“After three years and the loss of more than 2,300 American soldiers and tens of thousands of innocent Iraqi citizens, it is time for Congress to do what they were elected to do—debate the Bush war in Iraq and consider all alternatives,” said Win Without War National Director and former Congressman Tom Andrews (D-ME).   

 

<p>“If Congressional leaders will not allow such a debate, then rank-and-file members should rise up and force action. 218 signatures on H. Res 543 will do just that – stopping business as usual on Capitol Hill and forcing an immediate debate and vote.

 

<p>“More than 70% of our soldiers in Iraq and a growing majority of Americans believe that our troops should come home within a year. The very least that their representatives in Congress can do is their job. It is time for an honest debate in Congress and an up-or-down vote on the issue that Americans care about most. The men and women in uniform that Congress has put into harm’s way deserve no less,” continued Andrews.
