<p>NEW YORK - May 22 - <a href="http://www.SaveAccess.org">SaveAccess.org</a>, a national coalition of community media organizations and individuals, is coordinating a nationwide day of protests with actions taking place in New York City, Chicago, Boston, San Francisco on Wednesday, May 24th.

<p>FAIR is helping to organize the New York City protest.<br>

Join us. Make your voice heard.  

<p>Wednesday, May 24th 
at the Verizon World Headquarters <br>

140 West Street (at Vesey Street).
  
<p>12:30-1:30pm (Pre-assemble at 12:15pm)<br>

<a href="http://www.saveaccess.org/protest">www.saveaccess.org/protest</a><br>

(Times and locations of other nationwide actions listed below)

<p><b>We are protesting:
</b>
<p>1) Telco-driven congressional legislation (HR 5252 and S.2686) that endangers public access centers and channels, threatens to red-line communities, and undermines an open internet by not protecting net neutrality.<br>


We need to stop these bills in their current form -- we need more protections.

<p>2) Telco collusion with the NSA to illegally violate the privacy of tens of millions of Americans. <br>


We need to demand an investigation and enforcement of the law.

<p>3) The Telco campaign to buyoff statehouse and congressional representatives around the country to push their legislation through. <br>


We need real campaign finance reform and political transparency.
  
<p>4) The Telco policy of using “astroturf” groups to push their deceptions on the public. <br>


We need to expose these campaigns for what they are -- corporate propaganda.
 
<p>5) The mergers and takeovers within in the Telco industry that have resulted in the loss of tens of thousands of jobs. <br>


We need to stop the AT&T - BellSouth merger until there is accountability and thorough anti-trust reviews.
