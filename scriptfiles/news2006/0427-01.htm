<p>WASHINGTON - April 27 - The following is a  statement of Democracy 21 President Fred Wertheimer opposing rule  on Sham Lobbying and Ethics Bill: </p>
<p>   The House Rules Committee has reported an indefensible rule to  govern House floor consideration of an indefensible bill, H.R.  4975. </p>
<p>   The rule on H.R. 4975 should be opposed by every  Representative who supports real lobbying and ethics reform. </p>
<p>   If the rule on H.R. 4975 passes, every Representative who  opposes sham, fraudulent legislation should vote against H.R.  4975 on final passage. </p>
<p>   H.R. 4975 is an effort to fool the public into believing that  Representatives are responding to the corruption and lobbying  scandals in the House, when the bill fails to effectively address  these scandals and the numerous ethics and lobbying problems  facing the House. </p>
<p>   Under the Rules Committee's proposed rule, there is no way for  Members to even vote on the amendments that are essential to turn  this completely phony ''reform'' legislation into an acceptable  bill. </p>
<p>   The Rules Committee in reporting the rule for H.R. 4975, for  example, refused to make in order and allow Members to even vote  on critical amendments to: </p>
<p>   -- Establish an Office of Public Integrity in Congress to  assist the House Ethics Committee in enforcing the House ethics  rules; </p>
<p>   -- Require that Members pay charter costs for company planes  made available by corporations and others for Members' travel; </p>
<p>   -- Ban gifts to Members, including payments to finance parties  to &quot;honor&quot; or recognize Members at the national conventions; </p>
<p>   -- Require lobbyists to disclose to the public the various  ways in which they provide campaign funds and financial benefits  to assist Members; </p>
<p>   -- Require disclosure of the huge sums being secretly spent by  professional lobbying firms and lobbying organizations on  grassroots campaigns to stimulate lobbying of Congress by the  public, including multimillion dollar advertising campaigns; and </p>
<p>   -- Curb the revolving door by increasing the period of time  during which former Members are prohibited from lobbying their  former colleagues. </p>
<p>   Any Representative who votes for the rule on H.R. 4975 or for  this legislation should be treated as supporting the corrupt  status quo in the House. </p>
<p>   The pro-reform vote here is &quot;no&quot; on the rule and &quot;no&quot; on  H.R. 4975. </p>
