<a href="mailto:hboushey@cepr.net"><b>HEATHER BOUSHEY<br>
</b></a> An economist with the Center for Economic and Policy Research, 
Boushey said today: "New changes to the 1996 welfare reform law mean 
that more welfare participants will need to be in work activities and 
states will have less flexibility in defining what those activities are, 
all without significant increases in funding for child care. Single 
parents, especially low-income single parents, need access to the kinds 
of work supports that make moving from welfare to work viable. Most 
women leaving welfare enter jobs that don't provide the kinds of 
benefits -- paid sick days and holidays, paid family leave, or 
employer-provided health insurance -- that make work work. Those with 
children also need access to safe, affordable, and enriching child care. 
To promote work, welfare policy should not be based on rigid, national 
rules, but be flexible enough to recognize that families need to provide 
adequate care, and that many need access to education to move up the job 
ladder."<br>

<p><b><a href="mailto:dhenwood@panix.com">DOUG HENWOOD<br>
</a></b> Author of the book "Wall Street," Henwood said today: "With its 17th 
consecutive interest rate increase a virtual certainty, the Fed is 
running the risk of going too far, provoking a recession that almost no 
one wants, not even the notorious bond market vigilantes. But as a 
bearded academic succeeding the grossly overrated Greenspan, it looks 
like Bernanke has to prove his manliness to the markets. He certainly 
hasn't helped his case by apparently changing his mind every other week. 
But there's a good case to be made for a pause, now that the economy is 
slowing and wage growth is slowing to a crawl."<br>
