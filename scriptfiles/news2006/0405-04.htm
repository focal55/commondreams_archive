<p>WASHINGTON - April 5 - The following statement by Ralph Nader and associates is a call to 
action. We want you to contact US corporations and tell them taxpayers 
deserve some explicit appreciation for funding their government 
subsidies, tax breaks and bailouts. We suggest contacting the 
corporations mentioned in the article as a first step but feel free to 
add your own companies.

<p><b>Hey, Corporate Free Loaders! Show Taxpayers Some Appreciation!</b>
<p>If you work for a corporation, ask your own employer to support 
"Taxpayer Appreciation Day." (We've included contact information at the 
end of the article.)

<p>Take Action Now! April 15 is just around the corner. Please let us know 
what action you've taken and what type of response you receive by 
emailing info@csrl.org.**

<p>We are going to suggest that _April 15th of each year be designated 
Taxpayer Appreciation Day_, a day when corporations receiving taxpayer 
subsidies, bailouts, and other forms of corporate welfare can openly 
express their thanks to the citizens who have to provide these benefits.

<p>Though it may not be evident, quite a few industries -- and the profits 
they generate -- can be traced back to taxpayer-financed programs whose 
fruits have been given away to (mostly) larger businesses.

<p>Taxpayer dollars have funded discoveries made by NASA, the Department of 
Defense, and the National Institutes of Health and other federal 
agencies. In many instances the rights to those discoveries were later 
given away to companies that brag about them as though they were the 
fruits of their own investments. Taxpayer dollars have played a major 
role in the growth of the aviation and aerospace, biotechnology, 
pharmaceutical, computers, containerization and telecommunications 
industries -- to name a few.

<p>Though corporations insist they must file yearly income taxes just like 
everyone else, they are responsible for a sharply decreasing portion of 
federal tax dollars. Despite record profits, the percentage of corporate 
tax contributions to the federal budget has been steadily declining for 
fifty years and now stands at a mere 7.4% of the federal government 
income because of the loopholes they have driven into our tax laws. The 
average citizen is the one who pays.

<p>Clearly corporations that claim they are self-reliant are often, in 
fact, dependent on taxpayer funds to maintain their financial viability, 
including a variety of bailouts. The least they could do is thank us. 
Which is why we need something like _Taxpayer Appreciation Day. 
_Consider the following:

<p>General Electric bought RCA (which owned NBC) in the mid-1980s with 
funds it was able to save by using an outrageous tax loophole passed by 
Congress in 1981. That loophole allowed GE to pay no federal taxes on 
three years of profits, totaling more than $6 billion dollars. It also 
gave them a $125 million refund! That gave GE the money to buy RCA. GE 
should arrange a media extravaganza on NBC to say "Thank you, taxpayers."

<p>Pharmaceutical companies constantly ballyhoo their discoveries in 
advertisements. What they don't tell us is that many of the important 
nonredundant therapeutic drugs -- including most anticancer drugs -- 
were developed, in whole or in part, with taxpayer money and then given 
to them by the NIH and the Defense Department. Bristol-Meyers Squibb, 
for example, controls the rights to Taxol, an anticancer drug developed 
all the way through human clinical trials at the National Institutes of 
Health with $31 million of taxpayer moneys.

<p>Pharmaceutical companies spend billions on advertisements each year. 
Perhaps they should consider a big "Thank You, Taxpayers" ad campaign 
every April 15, if only to remind them where their drug research and 
development subsidies come from.

<p>Mining companies often receive vast sweetheart deals from taxpayers. 
Under the 1872 Mining Act hard rock mining companies are allowed to 
purchase mining rights to public land for only $5 an acre, no matter how 
valuable the minerals on (or in) that land might be. A Canadian company 
recently obtained ownership of $9 billion in gold on our federal land in 
Nevada after using the Mining Act to purchase the mining rights to it 
for about $30,000. Mining companies owe the taxpayers their publicized 
gratitude.

<p>Television broadcasters were given free license to use public airwaves 
(worth around $70 billion) by a supine Congress in 1997. They too should 
thank us. What about all those professional sports corporations that 
play and profit in taxpayer-funded stadiums and arenas? The owners and 
players should thank the fans/taxpayers who -- in spite of their largess 
-- still must pay through the nose for tickets. For years McDonalds 
received taxpayer subsidies to promote its products overseas as part of 
a foreign market access program. Now McDonalds is a ubiquitous brand 
name worldwide, but has it ever thanked the taxpayers who underwrote its 
efforts?

<p>Then there are the HMOs, hospitals, and defense contractors that have 
had their legal fees reimbursed by the taxpayers when our government 
prosecutes them for fraud or cost overruns. Those companies have great 
public relations firms which can help them show us their gratitude.

<p>Large corporations in America have taken too much from us for too long. 
It's time they shows us a little appreciation.
