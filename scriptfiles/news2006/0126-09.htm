<p>NEW YORK / WASHINGTON - January 26 - Conservative and liberal interest groups 
fighting a battle over the nomination of Judge Samuel Alito to the U.S. Supreme 
Court have adopted starkly different strategies – at least when it comes to 
their paid television advertising campaigns – according to new data released 
today by the Brennan Center for Justice at NYU School of Law and the Justice at 
Stake Campaign.&nbsp; The data shows the groups combining to spend slightly over 
$2.5 million for and against Alito since his nomination on October 31. While 
nearly double the amount spent for and against Chief Justice John Roberts, the 
figure is nonetheless much lower than many had predicted.&nbsp; The data is 
complete through January 22, which includes the full week of the confirmation 
hearings.</P>
<P>Conservative backers of Alito dedicated nearly the entirety of their 
advertising budget throughout the process to buying airtime on national cable 
networks such as CNN, Fox News and MSNBC.&nbsp; They sought to promote Alito’s 
credentials and to defend him from his liberal critics in their spots.&nbsp; 
Supporters spent virtually no money targeting individual senators with 
television ads, though the Family Research Council announced this week that it 
is launching a late round of radio ads directed at Democratic senators from 
“red” states like Arkansas, Louisiana and South Dakota.</P>
<P>“Conservative groups backing Judge Alito rarely deviated from their message 
that the nominee’s qualifications alone made him suitable for the Supreme 
Court,” said Deborah Goldberg, director of the Democracy Program at the Brennan 
Center for Justice.&nbsp; “When they did, it was only to attack the Judge’s 
critics.”</P>
<P>Opponents of Alito also invested in national cable advertising, particularly 
during the week of his hearings before the Senate Judiciary Committee.&nbsp; But 
they also spent nearly&nbsp; one of every three of their advertising dollars 
targeting states with senators who have been identified as swing voters on the 
Alito nomination.&nbsp; Critics continued to spend heavily on TV ads in Maine 
and Rhode Island, home to three moderate Republican senators.&nbsp; Starting the 
week of the hearings, they also ran ads in Ohio, presumably in an effort to sway 
Republican Senator Mike DeWine, who is regarded as being in a tough re-election 
campaign in 2006.&nbsp; Alito’s opponents also targeted Arkansas and Colorado, 
home to a number of conservative Democratic senators, in an effort to shore up 
Democratic “no” votes on Alito.</P>
<P>“Liberal groups focused their TV dollars on potential Senators in target 
states, rather than trying to convince the general public that Judge Alito was 
outside of the mainstream,” said Bert Brandenburg, executive director of Justice 
at Stake.&nbsp; “Their ads focused mostly on hot button issues like abortion and 
wire-tapping.” </P>
<P>The data for the project is gathered by TNS-Media Intelligence/CMAG, which 
tracks the nation’s top 100 broadcast markets and national cable advertising and 
provides estimates on the cost of each TV spot.&nbsp; Data and previous 
releases, as well as storyboards and streaming video of ads available to date, 
are available at brennancenter.org and justiceatstake.org. </P>
