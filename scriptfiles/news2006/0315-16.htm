<p>NEW YORK  - March 15 - Saying the government is violating the rights of Americans to 
hear constitutionally protected speech, the American Civil Liberties Union and 
the New York Civil Liberties Union today asked a federal court to prevent the 
Departments of State and Homeland Security from barring a prominent Swiss 
scholar from entering the country to speak to American audiences.
<P>In legal papers filed today, the ACLU said the government wrongfully used a 
section of the Patriot Act known as the &#8220;ideological exclusion&#8221; provision to 
deny a nonimmigrant visa to Tariq Ramadan, a Swiss citizen who now teaches at 
the University of Oxford. As a result, Ramadan will be unable to speak at events 
organized by the ACLU&#8217;s clients, the American Academy of Religion, the American 
Association of University Professors and PEN American Center.</P>
<P>&#8220;The government does not have the authority to exclude foreign scholars at 
the border simply because it disagrees with their political views,&#8221; said ACLU 
staff attorney Jameel Jaffer, who is lead counsel in this case. &#8220;To invest the 
government with that authority would be to invest it with sweeping power to 
manipulate and censor debate inside the United States.&#8221;</P>
<P>The ACLU and NYCLU are seeking a preliminary ruling that the government 
cannot bar entry to Ramadan based on the ideological exclusion provision, which 
authorizes the exclusion of foreigners who endorse terrorism. The groups say 
that there is no evidence &#8211; and the government has never pointed to any &#8211; that 
Ramadan approves of terrorism. In fact, they say, Ramadan has repeatedly 
condemned terrorism. Two days after the attacks of September 11, 2001, Ramadan 
published an open letter calling on Muslims to condemn terrorism, and in 2002, 
Ramadan joined a formal &#8220;Statement Rejecting Terrorism&#8221; issued by 199 prominent 
Muslims and Muslim organizations from around the world. Ramadan also strongly 
condemned last year&#8217;s bus and subway bombings in London, and recently accepted 
an invitation from Prime Minister Tony Blair to join a government task force to 
combat extremism in the United Kingdom.</P>
<P>The ACLU said Ramadan is not being excluded because of any alleged support of 
terrorism, but because he is a vocal critic of American policy in the Middle 
East, and of what he calls the &#8220;deleterious effects of unregulated 
consumerism.&#8221;&nbsp; </P>
<P>&#8220;It would be absurd to suggest that this criticism &#8211; the same kind of 
criticism that appears every morning in the editorial pages of major American 
newspapers &#8211; amounts to approval of terrorism,&#8221; writes the ACLU in today&#8217;s 
motion.</P>
<P>In a declaration submitted to the court today, Ramadan writes that he first 
learned his visa had been revoked on July 28, 2004, nine days before he and his 
family were to move to Indiana where he had accepted a tenured teaching position 
at the University of Notre Dame. Since then, Ramadan has been forced to reject 
numerous invitations from American organizations to lecture, attend conferences 
and meet with scholars in the United States, including an invitation from the 
Archbishop of Canterbury to participate in a seminar at Georgetown 
University.</P>
<P>In December 2005, Ramadan reapplied for a visa and was personally interviewed 
in Switzerland by a representative of the Department of Homeland Security, who, 
he says, asked him questions about his political associations and viewpoints. 
Ramadan said he was told that consideration of his application would likely take 
close to two years, and that he could not be assured of receiving a visa even at 
the end of that process. </P>
<P>The ACLU is asking the court to issue a preliminary ruling to allow Ramadan 
to attend PEN American Center&#8217;s &#8220;World Voices&#8221; Festival in New York, from April 
25 to 30.</P>
<P>The American Academy of Religion, the American Association of University 
Professors and PEN American Center also submitted affidavits to the court today 
arguing that the visa denial violates the First Amendment rights of their 
members and impoverishes academic debate inside the United States. In their 
legal papers, the ACLU and NYCLU said that the government does not have the 
authority to exclude an invited scholar from the country simply because it 
disagrees with what he has to say. </P>
<P>&#8220;The government should not be abusing immigration laws to censor the ideas we 
are allowed to hear,&#8221; said ACLU attorney Melissa Goodman. &#8220;We are concerned that 
the exclusion of Professor Ramadan marks a return to the Cold War days when the 
government regularly barred prominent foreign scholars because of their 
political viewpoints.&#8221;</P>
<P>The case is before Judge Paul A. Crotty of the Southern District of New York. 
In addition to Jaffer and Goodman, attorneys in the case are Judy Rabinovitz and 
Lucas Guttentag of the ACLU Immigrants Rights Project; Arthur N. Eisenberg of 
the NYCLU; and New York immigration lawyer Claudia Slovinsky.</P>
