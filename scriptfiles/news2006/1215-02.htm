<p>NEW YORK - December 15 - In an interview with the Canadian Broadcast Corporation aired this morning, David H. Wilkins, U.S. Ambassador to Canada, admitted that rendition victim Maher Arar remains on a U.S. government watch list. Mr. Arar, a Canadian citizen who was born in Syria, was detained by the U.S. as he was transferring through JFK airport on his way home in September 2002, delivered to Syrian authorities, tortured, and kept in a tiny underground cell for nearly a year before being released. In February 2004, the Center for Constitutional Rights filed the first challenge to one of the Bush administration's "extraordinary renditions" on his behalf, which is currently on appeal. Following an extensive investigation, a Canadian Commission of Inquiry released its report in September 2006 that cleared Mr. Arar of any connection to terrorism or illegal activity of any kind. 

<p>Said Center for Constitutional Rights Attorney Maria LaHood, "That the United States would have the gall to keep Maher on a watch list, implying that he poses a threat to this country, is outrageous, although not surprising, since this Administration is unwilling to admit its mistakes and still tries to conceal them. The real threat to the U.S. is our government's utter disregard for the rule of law and for the truth, which Maher has had the courage to stand up and expose." 

<p>CCR Executive Director Vincent Warren said, "After disappearing an innocent man, robbing him of his humanity, and destroying his life, the U.S. government owes Maher Arar an apology. What happened to Mr. Arar should never happen to another human being."
