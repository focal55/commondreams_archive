<p>WASHINGTON - June 13 - On the eve of the next horrific milestone, the 2,500 troop death in Iraq, families with loved ones who are serving in Iraq, those with loved ones who were killed in Iraq, and families whose loved ones may deploy or re-deploy are calling on the Bush Administration, Congress and decision-makers at all levels to honor the fallen and prevent further deaths by ending the occupation of Iraq, bringing our troops home now and taking care of them when they get here.

<p>Despite the Bush Administration's celebration of a continuing series of "banner days" and milestones in Iraq, Military Families Speak Out members have not seen milestones to celebrate; they are instead seeing gravestones - more and more of them each day. Military Families Speak Out is an organization of over 3,000 military families speaking out against the war in Iraq, the largest organization of military families in the history of the United States to ever oppose a war.

<p>"To lose a loved one to war is painful; but to lose a loved one to a war based on lies is more than unbearable," stated Diane Santoriello of Verona, Pennsylvania whose son First Lt. Neil Santoriello, age 24, served in the Army and was killed in action near Fallujah on August 13, 2004.

<p>"Many parents of daughters who are my daughter's age worry about their grades in college, or whether their job is suited to them, or how to help them afford gas these days. I worry every minute of every day about whether my daughter will make it through yet another day, as she participates in a war that should never have been" said Maureen Hearn of Needham, Massachusetts, whose daughter in the Army is  currently serving a first deployment in Iraq.

<p>Available for Interview: The following and other members of Military Families Speak Out and Gold Star Families Speak Out are available for
