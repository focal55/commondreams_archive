<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --> LONDONDERRY, New Hampshire - May 31 - <br>
<p>May 30, 2056 - The story of how we solved the global warming crisis was released on a web video today on the website www.RenewUS.org. Arriving 50 years after Al Gore’s revolutionary film, “An Inconvenient Truth” opened nationally across the United States, the video dips into history to report how the consumer movement to demand clean energy triggered a business and political response that has finally brought the era of climate change to a close. 

 

<p>The “Climate: A Crisis Averted” video tells the story of how America moved away from fossil fuels and the failed policies of the past, toward a world in which clean energy now powers our cities, car tailpipes emit nothing worse than drinking water, a healthy 110-year old Martha Stewart offers pastel-colored solar panels, and McDonald’s fuel stations sell used french fry oil for our Bio-powered flying cars. 

 

<p>RenewUS.org played a historic role showing Americans how they could order clean energy from their local power companies. Consumers and business owners were able to click on a map of their state and get detailed information about which local utilities provided options to purchase clean energy, helping to trigger the worldwide consumer and business demand that rose to counter climate change.

 

<p>“We believe that the climate change story will have a happy ending,” Gary Hirshberg, President and CE-Yo of Stonyfield Farm, said in 2006, in a time capsule statement  “The climate science debate is over, but what do we do about it? We are hoping that the planet will be saved by ordinary citizens taking action to stop global warming, and demanding the same from companies and politicians.”

 

<p>RenewUS has been a collaborative effort launched by <a href="http://www.stonyfield.com/">Stonyfield Farm, Inc.</a>, the world’s leading organic yogurt company and America’s first manufacturer to offset 100 percent of its CO2 emissions from its facility energy use; Clean Air-Cool Planet, a nonprofit organization that reduces greenhouse gas emissions through work with corporations, communities, and campuses and educates industry, consumers and policy makers about the challenges and solutions to global climate change and Earth Day Network, an international environmental network dedicated since 1970 to empowering people to effect large scale positive environmental change.
