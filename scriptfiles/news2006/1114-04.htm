<p>NEW YORK - November 14 - Homeowners have been  tapping into their home equity to get the cash needed to pay down  credit card debt incurred not for luxury expenses, but for basic  needs. This strategy leaves them on precarious financial footing  after two years of interest rate hikes and the largest drop in  home prices in 35 years, according to &quot;House of Cards 2006  Update: Still Refinancing The American Dream&quot;, a report published  today by Demos, a non-partisan public policy organization based  in New York. </p>
<p>   &quot;House of Cards 2006&quot; is based on extensive analysis of  government, industry and academic research and provides a  comprehensive analysis of the causes and impact of the mortgage  refinancing boom in the United States since 2001. The report  shows that, as mortgage interest rates fell to record levels  during the refinance boom, many Americans cashed out home equity  to pay down debt and finance living expenses -- a quick-fix that  compounds the long-term economic burdens of the average family.  The net result: The financial well-being of many Americans is at  risk as the refinancing boom blurred the line between good debt - - debt that results in an appreciable asset, such as a house with  equity -- and bad debt, which does not. </p>
<p>   &quot;As the housing bubble deflates and with interest rates on  risky adjustable rate mortgages rising, more and more homeowners  are feeling the pinch,&quot; said Jennifer Wheary, senior fellow at  Demos and co-author of the report. &quot;About $1.4 trillion in  adjustable rate mortgages will reset between 2006 and the end of  2007, leaving many homeowners facing monthly payments that are 25  percent higher. Since refinancing for a second or third time has  become a common band-aid to offset skyrocketing costs and delay  the impact of a weaker housing market, many homeowners will find  themselves making unmanageable payments on houses in which they  have little or no equity and which may no longer hold the value  of the original mortgage.&quot; </p>
<p>   &quot;This is a dangerous time for American families,&quot; added  Wheary. &quot;About a third of home mortgages continue at an  adjustable rate; previously-rare interest-only mortgages made up  20 percent of home loans in 2005; and sub-prime home loans are  widespread. The evidence is clear -- default rates could  skyrocket in the coming years as millions of American homeowners  find themselves way over their heads in these loans.&quot; </p>
<p>   Key findings from the report include: </p>
<p>   -- Households cashed out $715 billion worth of home equity  between 2001 and 2005. In the three years between 2003 and 2005,  owners extracted $150 million more in equity from their homes  than they did in the previous eight.</p>
<p>   -- Households have used cash equity from their homes to cover  living expenses and pay down credit card debt, further eroding  their homes' cash value, which many families rely on for economic  security in times of emergency, to finance education or for  retirement. </p>
<p>   -- Between 1973 and 2004, average home equity actually fell --  from 68.3 percent to 55 percent. In other words, Americans own  less of their homes today than they did in the 1970s and early  1980s.</p>
<p>   -- In 2006, the financial obligations ratio -- the percentage  of monthly income to the amount needed to manage monthly debt  payments -- surpassed 19 percent, a record since data started  being collected in 1980. </p>
<p>   -- About $400 billion worth of adjustable-rate mortgages,  representing about five percent of all outstanding mortgage debt,  are set to readjust this year for the first time. Another $1  trillion in loans are set to readjust in 2007. </p>
<p>   -- Adjustable rate mortgages made up 31 percent of home loans  in 2005. Interest-only loans, which were uncommon just two years  ago, made up about 20 percent of loans. </p>
<p>   -- Industry experts predict a spike in refinancing next year  as homeowners seek relief from these large increases and look to  refinance for the second or third time. </p>
<p>   -- The rise of appraisal fraud has fueled inflated home prices  over the last several years and could leave many homeowners  &quot;upside down&quot; in their homes -- that is, owing much more than the  true market value of their home. </p>
<p>   -- Even though it is underreported, appraisal fraud was the  fastest type of mortgage fraud reported by major lenders in 2000  and there is no end in sight. In 2005 more than 22,000 cases of  mortgage fraud were reported to the FBI, a seven fold increase  since 1999.</p>
<p>   -- With the past two years of interest rate hikes by the  Federal Reserve, families with adjustable rate mortgages are  experiencing significant increases in their monthly mortgage  payments. The combination of higher mortgage payments coupled  with rising costs of basic living expenses represents a growing  financial threat and is leading many families to refinance for a  second or third time.</p>
<p>   One of the most alarming findings in the report is the role  that mortgage fraud, in particular appraisal fraud, plays in the  refinancing process. There are growing numbers of third party  brokers pressuring appraisers to inflate home values in order to  &quot;close the deal&quot; and reap larger fees or bonuses. The consequence  can be dire for homeowners who refinance and draw out more cash  equity than their home is actually worth. Unfortunately, banks  often spend little time investigating the appraisal process,  because they normally hold the loans for a short period before  they re-bundle and sell them to investment firms. </p>
<p>   The report suggests reforms that would have immediate and  long-lasting impact-to improve the financial security of  America's households:</p>
<p>   -- Enact a Borrower's Security Act. New legislation is  required in order to ensure that borrowers are protected from the  excessive rates, fees and capricious changes in account terms,  which are all legal and common industry practices today. </p>
<p>   -- Strengthen Current Bankruptcy Laws To Support Hard Working  Families In Severe Economic Distress. Bankruptcy is the last  resort for hard working families who find themselves in dire  straits. Many middle class families are left in this situation  from unforeseen circumstances such as health problems and  unpredictable illness. In 2005 Congress passed sweeping changes  to bankruptcy laws which removed many protections available to  average families. As families' financial stability grows  increasingly fragile and the safety net of home equity  evaporates, these changes must be reexamined and reversed. </p>
<p>   -- Protect Americans from Appraisal Fraud. While Congress  passed comprehensive reforms after the Savings and Loans  financial crisis, further reform is needed to protect consumers  from the ruinous effects of appraisal fraud. The Appraisal  Institute reported that more than 7,000 appraisers have been  pressured to inflate appraisals. Congress should ensure that  brokers are prohibited from coercing or intimidating appraisers  in order to receive a desired property appraisal value. </p>
<p>   &quot;There's a financial crisis hitting America's families,&quot; said  Tamara Draut, director of the Economic Opportunity Program at  Demos. &quot;In order to make ends meet, Americans have been depleting  the one key asset that most rely on for future financial security  -- their home. And now out of control lending practices are going  to cause millions to teeter on the edge. There are many clear  steps that Congress can take to start to protect America's  households from economic ruin, and help restore the security that  homeownership once promised. They can, and should, start now.&quot; </p>
