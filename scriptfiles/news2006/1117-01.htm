<p>WASHINGTON - November 17 – 
<p>TIM REDMOND, <a href="mailto:tredmond@sfbg.com">tredmond@sfbg.com</a><p>Executive editor of the San Francisco Bay Guardian, Redmond has been 
tracking Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi's career for over a decade. He 
<a href="http://www.sfbg.com/entry.php?entry_id=2094&catid=4&volume_id=254&issue_id=263&volume_num=41&issue_num=07" target="_new">recently wrote the article</a> "Pelosi is not one of us," in which he 
stated: "Pelosi is by no means a San Francisco liberal. She's a 
Washington insider, a born and bred politician who cares more about 
power and money than she does about any particular ideology.
<p>"I'm glad the Democrats are in charge, and Pelosi deserves 
tremendous credit for making that happen. But she's not about to push 
any kind of ambitious left-wing political or cultural agenda.
<p>"Just look at her record. Pelosi was weak on the war and late in 
opposing it. She was the author of the bill that gave that well-known 
pauper George Lucas the lucrative contract to build a commercial office 
building in a national park. She worked with Republicans such as Don 
Fisher of the Gap on the Presidio privatization and set a precedent for 
the National Park System that the most rabid antigovernment 
conservatives can love.
<p>"Just this week Bloomberg News reported that Pelosi is working with 
Silicon Valley venture capital firms to weaken the post-Enron 
Sarbanes-Oxley law, which mandates strict accounting procedures for 
publicly held corporations.
<p>"And just a couple of weeks before the election, she told 60 Minutes 
that same-sex marriage is 'not an issue that we're fighting about here.' ...
<p>"She's pretty much stopped representing San Francisco. On issue 
after issue, her constituents are way to the left of her. This fall she 
didn't even bother to show up in the district (except to extract money 
for Democratic congressional campaigns around the country). She spent 
election night in Washington."
