<p>WASHINGTON - March 13 - The Administration's  proposed budget for the Housing Choice Voucher Program for 2007  would underfund roughly 70 percent of the state and local housing  agencies that administer the program, according to a new Center  on Budget and Policy Priorities' analysis.  These agencies would  be forced to reduce the number of low-income families receiving  rental assistance unless they can reduce costs in other ways.  At  the same time, about one-quarter of agencies would be overfunded  and thus would be able to expand their voucher programs.</p>
<p>   The voucher program, the nation's largest low-income housing  program, provides low-income households with vouchers they can  use to rent housing on the private market.  </p>
<p>   The inefficient allocation of voucher funds under the  Administration's budget reflects flaws in the voucher funding  formula the Administration has used in recent years, which  underfunds some housing agencies while overfunding others.  </p>
<p>   &quot;Since early 2004, voucher assistance for more than 100,000  families has been lost, not only because Congress didn't provide  sufficient funds but also because the funds were not distributed  based on current needs,&quot; said Barbara Sard, director of housing  policy at the Center and the report's lead author.  &quot;Given the  long and growing waiting lists for vouchers in many communities,  that's a painful loss.&quot;</p>
<p>   &quot;Unfortunately, the Administration's new budget relies on the  same basic funding formula that has caused problems over the past  couple of years,&quot; she added.  As a result, although the  Administration's budget would increase funding for the voucher  program by 3 percent, some state and local agencies would be able  to fund less than 60 percent of their authorized vouchers in  2007, while other agencies would be able to fund more than 140  percent of their authorized vouchers.  A quarter of all agencies  would be able to use less than 90 percent of their authorized  vouchers.</p>
<p>   The Center's report includes state-by-state and  locality-by-locality estimates of the effects of the  Administration's budget on the areas served by the 2,400 agencies  that administer the voucher program.  For example, the District  of Columbia Housing Authority, which is assisting 610 fewer  families this year than last year because of funding limitations,  would be forced to shrink its program by another 145 families in  2007 under the Administration's budget.  &quot;Rents are increasing  rapidly in the District, so housing is becoming much less  affordable, but we're being forced to cut back the number of  people we help,&quot; noted Michael Kelly, executive director of the  D.C. housing authority.  &quot;That's the exact opposite of what we  should be doing.&quot;</p>
<p>   Administration Funding Level Is Adequate If Funding Formula Is  Changed</p>
<p>   Under the Administration's funding formula, each housing  agency's funding level is based on the amount of funding it was  eligible to receive the previous year, adjusted by an inflation  factor set by HUD based on two-year-old data.  Because the  formula does not take into account the actual number of vouchers  the agency distributed in the previous year or recent changes in  local voucher costs, it leaves many agencies with insufficient  funds to continue all of the vouchers currently in use.  </p>
<p>   An added problem is that the formula has never been fully  funded:  since the formula was first introduced in 2005, the  Administration has not requested, and Congress has not provided,  enough funding to give agencies the full amounts for which they  are eligible under the formula.</p>
<p>   As a result, HUD imposed across-the-board funding cuts on  agencies in 2005 and 2006 below the formula amount.  The  Administration's budget continues this pattern, imposing an even  larger across-the-board cut in 2007.  This would force agencies  that are already underfunded by the formula to eliminate even  more vouchers.</p>
<p>   Fully funding the formula would not eliminate the need for  some agencies to cut back on vouchers, since many agencies are  shortchanged by the formula itself.  If, however, the formula  were revised to better reflect agencies' actual costs and actual  number of vouchers in use, the Administration's proposed funding  level for 2007 would be sufficient to continue all of the roughly  2 million vouchers in use in 2006.</p>
<p>   Major Policy Shift Would Cut Back on Number of Replacement  Vouchers</p>
<p>   In addition, the Administration's budget request for &quot;tenant  protection&quot; vouchers, which replace other types of federal  housing assistance that are being eliminated (such as when  public-housing units are demolished) is nearly $30 million below  last year's appropriation.  In a major policy shift, the budget  would provide tenant protection vouchers only to replace  subsidized units that were under lease at the time they were  eliminated.  In the past, tenant protection vouchers were  generally provided to replace all lost subsidized units,  including those that were temporarily unoccupied, in order to  keep the community's overall supply of affordable housing from  shrinking.  </p>
<p>   &quot;This change could be especially harmful for areas hit by last  year's hurricanes,&quot; noted Sard.  &quot;Many subsidized units that were  occupied when the storms hit are now uninhabitable and will  likely be demolished.  But because the units are not currently  occupied and may not be under lease by the time they are  demolished, the community would not receive replacement vouchers  for these unoccupied units.  Communities could end up losing a  significant share of their subsidized housing.&quot;</p>
