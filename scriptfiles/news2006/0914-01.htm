<p>SINGAPORE - September 14 - The World Bank's credibility is in jeopardy. Most 
of the 500 campaigners accredited to attend the Sept. 19-20 Singapore 
World Bank and International Monetary Fund annual meetings, usually 
attended by hundreds of campaigners, will boycott their meetings with 
the Bank.

<p>As of today, the boycott that Friends of the Earth International and 
others called for has been joined by more than 80 social, environmental 
and small farmers' organizations from around the world.

<p>They will boycott all meetings planned with the World Bank in Singapore, 
to protest the city-state's expulsion and ban of international activists 
who were officially accredited by the World Bank to attend the meetings.

<p>"The World Bank's demand to Singapore to accept the banned campaigners 
is too little and comes way too late. The Bank ignored calls not to 
choose Singapore for its Annual Meeting while knowing that a ban on 
protests was likely to be put in place. What is happening in Singapore 
is another blow to the little that was left of the World Bank's 
credibility" said Longgena Ginting, who coordinates Friends of the Earth 
International's Financial Institutions campaign.

<p>Singaporean authorities set up a list of at least 28 people to be banned 
from Singapore because they would pose a 'security risk'. These 
campaigners were accredited by the IMF and World Bank.

<p>"In solidarity with those denied entry into Singapore and denied the 
exercise of their fundamental rights to freedom of expression and 
association, we will stay away from all meetings and seminars in the 
official programme at the World Bank and IMF 2006 annual meetings," the 
groups said in a joint statement.

<p>Friends of the Earth International considers the Singaporean 
government's ban a grave violation of the principles of democracy and 
good governance.

<p>CASES OF DEPORTATIONS AND DETENTIONS:

<p>Chona Ramos from GCAP Asia and Booby Diciembre from Jubilee South , who 
were organizing the International Peoples's Forum (a Sept. 15-17 event 
due to take place in Batam, Indonesia, in parallel to the World Bank/IMF 
meetings) have been deported from Singapore. Filomeno Santa Ana, an 
established economist and academic on development finance and economic 
governance from the Philippines is currently being detained by the 
Singaporean immigration authorities at Changi international airport, as 
is a representative of ActionAid Vietnam.
