<p>WASHINGTON - March 9 - 
<p>SELIG HARRISON, via Haeyoung Kim, asiaintern@ciponline.org, 
<a href="http://www.ciponline.org/asia/articles/011806harrison.htm%20">http://www.ciponline.org/asia/articles/011806harrison.htm<br>
</a>Available for a limited number of interviews, Harrison is director 
of the Asia program at the Center for International Policy and author of 
five books on nonproliferation and Asian affairs. He wrote recently: 
"The nuclear negotiations between Iran and the European Union were based 
on a bargain that the European Union, held back by the U.S., has failed 
to honor. Iran agreed to suspend its uranium enrichment efforts 
temporarily pending the outcome of discussions on a permanent enrichment 
ban. The EU promised to put forward proposals for economic incentives 
and security guarantees in return for a permanent ban but subsequently 
refused to discuss security issues." Harrison is also closely following 
the recent U.S.-India nuclear deal.

<p>JAMES PAUL, james.paul@globalpolicy.org, <a href="http://www.globalpolicy.org">http://www.globalpolicy.org<br>
</a>Paul is executive director of the Global Policy Forum, which 
monitors the United Nations. He is closely following developments 
regarding Iran at the UN.

<p>ALICE SLATER, aslater@gracelinks.org, <a href="http://gracelinks.org/nuke">http://gracelinks.org/nuke</a><br>
President of the GRACE Policy Institute, which works on nuclear 
issues, Slater said today: "The Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty 
explicitly obliges signatories like the U.S., U.K., Russia, China and 
France who have nuclear weapons 'to pursue negotiations in good faith on 
effective measures relating to cessation of the nuclear arms race at an 
early date and to nuclear disarmament, and on a treaty on general and 
complete disarmament under strict and effective international control.' 
The nuclear powers are out of compliance with this, and the U.S. is 
pursuing a nuclear deal with India which undermines the NPT. So why 
should we expect Iran to follow the treaty?"

<p>MICHAEL SPIES, michael@lcnp.org, <a href="http://www.lcnp.org">http://www.lcnp.org</a><br>
Spies is program associate with the Lawyers' Committee on Nuclear 
Policy. The group has recently released several documents assessing the 
situation with Iran. Spies noted today: "Two issues underlie this 
standoff, which must be kept separate. The first issue relates to the 
International Atomic Energy Agency fulfilling its statutory obligation 
to verify the peaceful nature of Iran's nuclear program. The second 
issue is Iran's pursuit of nuclear fuel cycle capabilities, which has 
been the focus of U.S. and EU efforts. The Security Council should 
consider whether and how it can practically facilitate the IAEA's task 
of verifying the peaceful use of nuclear energy."
