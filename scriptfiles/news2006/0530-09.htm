<p>PIERRE, South Dakota - May 30 - Today, NARAL Pro- Choice South Dakota joined the Campaign for Healthy Families to  deliver nearly 38,000 signatures from South Dakota voters  supporting a measure to repeal the state's abortion ban.  </p>
<p>   NARAL Pro-Choice South Dakota, working in partnership with the  Campaign for Healthy Families, provided financial and volunteer  support for the signature-collection effort. </p>
<p>   &quot;South Dakotans signed up to fight this threat to women's  health. It is an attack on the fundamental values of freedom and  privacy that we cherish,&quot; said Thelma Underberg, executive  director of NARAL Pro-Choice South Dakota. &quot;We were proud to work  with the Campaign for Healthy Families to collect thousands of  signatures with extensive support from our friends and neighbors.  We look forward to focusing on the next phase of the campaign:  securing the votes necessary to repeal this egregious abortion  ban in November.&quot;</p>
<p>   Under South Dakota law, the campaign had to gather 16,728  signatures from registered voters to refer the state abortion ban  to the November ballot, a number that organizers said they have  surpassed.
