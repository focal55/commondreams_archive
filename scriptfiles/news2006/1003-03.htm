<p>ST. BERNARD PARISH, Louisiana - October 3 - An ordinance barring single-family 
                            homeowners from renting to anyone except blood relatives 
                            discriminates against African Americans and Hispanics, 
                            according to a lawsuit filed today by the Greater 
                            New Orleans Fair Housing Action Center (GNOFHAC) and 
                            the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law. 
                            In St. Bernard Parish, an overwhelmingly white area 
                            where over 93% of all such homes are owned by whites, 
                            this will disproportionately exclude minorities and 
                            perpetuate the parish's history of segregation.<br>
                            <br>
                            &#147;After Hurricane Katrina, displaced families 
                            of all kinds remain in desperate need of housing, 
                            especially around New Orleans. But rather than welcome 
                            people back, St. Bernard is slamming the door in their 
                            face,&#148; said Barbara Arnwine, Executive Director 
                            of the Lawyers' Committee.<br>
                            <br>
                            The ordinance, passed on September 19th, builds upon 
                            other exclusionary measures taken by St. Bernard that 
                            have the intent and effect of excluding minorities, 
                            the complaint alleges. In particular, the St. Bernard 
                            Parish Council has acted to ban and restrict owners 
                            from offering rental units disproportionately used 
                            and needed by African Americans and Hispanics. <br>
                            <br>
                            For example, in November 2005, the Parish passed an 
                            ordinance restricting leasing of units in multi-family 
                            developments. In March 2006, an ordinance barring 
                            rental of all single-family homes was passed. The 
                            present ordinance creates an exception but one that 
                            is essentially limited to whites only. Combined, these 
                            ordinances choke off rental housing desperately needed 
                            since the storm - and disproportionately needed by 
                            minorities. (In St. Bernard, only 20% of whites are 
                            renters, while the figure is 45% for Blacks and 31% 
                            for Hispanics.) <br>
                            <br>
                            &#147;Given the history and the effect of this ordinance, 
                            the facts are clear: St. Bernard is trying to keep 
                            out Blacks and Hispanics,&#148; said Joseph D. Rich, 
                            Director of the Fair Housing and Community Development 
                            Project at the Lawyers' Committee. &#147;The rationale 
                            for this new ordinance - that they want to promote 
                            owners only - doesn't make sense. It's just a pretext 
                            for discrimination.&#148;<br>
                            <br>
                            <i>The lawsuit seeks an order declaring that the ordinances 
                            violate the Fair Housing Act, 42 U.S.C. &sect; 3604, 
                            which prohibits discrimination which &#147;makes unavailable&#148; 
                            dwellings on the basis of race or other categories, 
                            and other civil rights laws, including the Equal Protection 
                            clause of the constitution. In addition, plaintiffs 
                            seek a court order enjoining the ordinances.</i><b><br>
