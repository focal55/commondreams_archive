<p>WASHINGTON - April 28 - The following is a  statement by David Friedman, research director, Clean Vehicles  Program, Union of Concerned Scientists, regarding the President's call for fuel economy reform: </p>
<p>   &quot;The public should be wary of the president's call for  authority to 'reform' fuel economy standards for cars.  It is  very likely he will take the same road he did when he revised the  fuel economy standards for SUVs, minivans and pickups, which will  save less than two weeks of gasoline a year over the next two  decades.  If rumors are true that the president might target a 10  percent increase in the standard for cars, it would save less  than a week's worth of gasoline over the next two decades. Talk  about a drop in the bucket.&quot; </p>
<p>   &quot;After 9/11, two devastating hurricanes and record gasoline  prices, we should expect real political leadership on fuel  economy. Unfortunately, this just seems like an attempt to play  pre-election politics with gasoline prices.  Real leadership from  the president and Congress would be to increase the fuel economy  of all cars and light trucks to 40 miles per gallon over the next  decade.  This would be the equivalent of offering a $600 annual  tax break from reduced fuel costs. If the president did this, we  would celebrate his leadership -- and so would the American  people. </p>

<p>   &quot;Unfortunately, the president's plan would change the fuel  economy system from having one standard for all cars to having  lower standards for bigger vehicles, creating a loophole that  will encourage manufacturers to produce bigger, less efficient  cars. The drop in the bucket savings from the fuel economy  increase would drain right through the loophole. If Congress is  going to grant the president authority to revamp car fuel economy  targets, they must also include a requirement that an oil savings  guarantee be attached to any changes. To help consumers save  money at the pump, Congress should ensure that the fuel savings  are two to three times larger than what the president offered for  light trucks in March.&quot; </p>
