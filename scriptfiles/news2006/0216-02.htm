<p>WASHINGTON - February 16 - Green Party leaders called on all Americans to recognize 
and stand up to various attacks by the Bush White House on the right to 
political dissent.

<p>Greens noted expanded government power to block and crush protest, President 
Bush's order for the NSA to spy on U.S. citizens without obtaining warrants 
in accord with FISA, surveillance of library records, and evidence (such as 
the no-fly list) that the U.S. government is compiling databases on 
Americans who disagree with Bush policies.

<p>Among more recent and less known threats:

<p>
<ul>
<li>A new provision in the USA Patriot Act bill would allow authorities to 
arrest demonstrators on felony charges at any "special event of national 
significance" if they are caught breaching a security perimeter.  The 
measure would extend the power of the Secret Service, allowing agents to 
arrest people who enter an arbitrarily defined restricted area at an event, 
even when the President or any other official protected by the Secret 
Service isn't present.  No hearings are planned on the provision. </li>
</ul>
<p>"The new provision will empower the Secret Service to declare any area at 
any given time the site of an event of 'national significance' in order to 
arrest people expressing unwelcome political ideas and charge them with a 
felony," said Jody Grage Haug, co-chair of the Green Party of the United 
States and founder of the Nonviolent Peacekeeper Pool in Seattle.  "It'll 
crush the kind of civil protest that was necessary to advance the civil 
rights movement.  The purpose of the new Patriot Act provision is not 
security, but intimidation and suppression of political speech."

<p>Greens are urging Congress to vote down the current version of the USA 
Patriot Act, citing the 'security perimeter' provision as well as other 
warrantless invasions of privacy.

<p>
<ul>
<li>In the wake of criminal property destruction by small number of 
environmental activists, the U.S. Department of Justice has called such acts 
'eco-terrorism', even though such actions have nothing to do with inflicting 
injury and fear on human beings.  (The Green Party supports neither violent 
protest nor vandalism.)</li>
</ul>
<p>"When public officials label vandalism and other property crimes 
'terrorism', then terrorism ceases to have any useful meaning -- except as a 
tool for making the public see all dissent, including nonviolent civil 
disobedience and legitimate environmental protest, as criminal behavior," 
said Richard Scott, Online Fundraising and Outreach Coordinator for the 
Green Party.

<p>
<ul>
<li>During his February 7 confirmation hearing, Judge Samuel Alito declared "I 
stand behind this President being commander-in-chief, to pursue fifth column 
movements," defining fifth column as "a movement known to every war where 
American citizens will sympathize with the enemy and collaborate with the 
enemy."</li>
</ul>
<p>Since the Bush Administration has accused its critics of expressing sympathy 
with America's enemies, Judge Alito's comments imply that the Court should 
uphold White House efforts to spy on, intimidate, and suppress political 
dissent.  Judge Alito also espouses an "unitary executive" theory of an 
imperial presidency that stands above the law and beyond the oversight of 
Congress and the courts.

<p>"When Judge Alito talks about fifth column movements, he means all Americans 
who protested the invasion of Iraq and who will protest the impending U.S. 
assault on Iran," said Rebecca Rotzler, co-chair of the Green Party and 
participant in the 1999 WTO protests in Seattle as a member of the 
Mid-Hudson (New York) Direct Action Network.

<p>
<ul>
<li>On January 24, Halliburton subsidiary KBR announced that the Department of 
Homeland Security's U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement component has 
awarded KBR a five-year $385 million contract to build and maintain 
detention centers to deal with "an emergency influx of immigrants, or to 
support the rapid development of new programs" -- possibly in response to 
political unrest. </li>
</ul>
<p>"In recent years, peaceful protesters against global trade authorities and 
against the war on Iraq have increasingly found themselves detained for over 
24 hours without charge.  We know that FEMA has sought bids from major real 
estate and engineering firms to construct giant internment facilities, 
ostensibly to deal with disasters and attacks on the U.S.  But evidence that 
FEMA also claims the power to detain political protesters goes back to the 
Iran-Contra hearings in the 1980s.  The American people should recognize 
these developments as ominous in the era of endless 'war on terror', 
military occupation of Iraq, and a likely U.S. military attack on Iran," 
said said Sundiata Tellem, co-chair of the Green Party Black Caucus.

<p>Greens noted that some leaders in Congress, including Democrats, are already 
backing down from holding President Bush accountable for his illegal order 
for domestic spying without warrant or congressional oversight.

<p>"These threats to our freedoms and to the rule of law are more dire than at 
any time in U.S. history, because of surveillance technology, training of 
civilian police forces in military tactics as ordered by President Clinton 
in the mid 1990s, and the control of media by conglomerates that benefit 
from such policies.  The Green Party has already called for impeachment of 
President Bush and Vice President Cheney for various crimes and abuses of 
power.  But it will take a very loud 'No!' from the American people and a 
concerted effort to remove the Bush regime from power if we're going to 
regain our rights and freedoms," said Marc Sanson, co-chair of the Green 
Party and former director of the Heartland Peace Center in Springfield, 
Illinois.
