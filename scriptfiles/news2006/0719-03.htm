<p>WASHINGTON - July 19 - Patricia Todd made history Tuesday when voters in Alabama's 54th legislative district voted to send the Democrat to the State House, marking the first time ever that legislature will include an openly gay Representative. The Gay & Lesbian Victory Fund, the nation's largest gay and lesbian political action committee, endorsed Todd and helped raise tens of thousands of dollars from its national network of donors to help fund her campaign. Todd has no Republican opponent in the general election in November. 

<p>"The road to equality in Alabama is a mile shorter today," said Chuck Wolfe, president and CEO of the Victory Fund. "Gays and lesbians in Alabama will now have what all Americans deserve -- a voice and a vote. Alabama knows well what a single voice can accomplish. We applaud Patricia's courage in stepping up to be heard," Wolfe said.

<p>In other elections Tuesday, Victory-endorsed candidate Rep. Karla Drenner won her Democratic primary to advance to the general election in November. Drenner is Georgia's only openly gay state legislator. Allen Thornell, a Victory endorsee who is seeking election to the Georgia state House, advanced to a runoff in his Democratic primary election. 

<p>"Karla's voice in the Georgia legislature is vitally important. We're working hard both to make sure she stays there and to help elect Allen Thornell to join her," Wolfe said. Thornell would be the first openly gay man in the Georgia legislature.
