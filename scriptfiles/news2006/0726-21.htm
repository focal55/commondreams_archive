<p>WASHINGTON - July 26 - Same-sex couples and their families will continue to be denied equal rights and responsibilities under law today following a decision by the Washington State Supreme Court.

<p>“America is built on the values of fairness and equality and the long march toward realizing that dream continues,” said Human Rights Campaign Joe Solmonese. “While Washington families will continue to be denied basic fairness under the law, millions of fair-minded citizens will continue to press on for full equality. Working with Equal Rights Washington and leaders in the state, we’ll now work to ensure their voices are heard in the Legislature as this now moves to the statehouse.”

<p>Solmonese continued, “We commend the plaintiff couples and the Northwest Women’s Law Center, Lambda Legal and the American Civil Liberties Union for bringing this important case forward. By giving voice to the compelling stories of hundreds of thousands of same-sex couples and their families in Washington, these heroes changed hearts and minds across the state.”

<p>The two cases – <i>Andersen v. King County</i> and <i>Castle v. State of Washington</i> – were brought by the Northwest Women’s Law Center, Lambda Legal and the American Civil Liberties Union on behalf of 19 same-sex couples from across the state previously denied the right to marry and fully protect their families.

<p>In a dissent, Justice Bobbe J. Bridge writes, “The impact of this case upon the plaintiff couples and their children is both far reaching and deeply saddening. The impact extends to all of Washington’s gay and lesbian citizens and to the many fair-minded Washington citizens who hoped for a different result in this case. And, I dare say, the result that we reach today will be remembered more for what it does not do than for what it does.”
