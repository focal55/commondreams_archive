<p>WASHINGTON - December 21 - The federal government is illegally restricting the ability of 
U.S. health organizations to end the global HIV/AIDS epidemic, charged the 
American Civil Liberties Union and more than 25 public health and human rights 
organizations in a legal brief filed today.</P>
<P>The groups are urging a federal appeals court to reject a U.S. policy known 
as the "AIDS Leadership Act," which requires organizations that receive U.S. 
federal funding-regardless of their mission-to explicitly pledge to oppose 
commercial sex work. Two federal courts have already ruled that the policy 
violates the First Amendment rights of U.S. organizations, but the government is 
appealing those decisions.</P>
<P>"It is shameful that the Bush administration would value its political agenda 
over human lives," said Claudia Flores, an attorney with the ACLU Women&#8217;s Rights 
Project and counsel on today&#8217;s brief. "Rather than saving lives, this global gag 
rule will put women and girls at serious risk of infection and death. This 
policy is completely at odds with efforts to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS and 
to treat its victims."</P>
<P>The groups filed a friend-of-the-court brief in the U.S. Court of Appeals for 
the Second Circuit in <EM>U.S. Agency for International Development v. Alliance for 
Open Society International</EM>. In the brief, the groups emphasize the damaging 
impact the policy would have on public health worldwide. The groups also argue 
that the policy violates the free speech rights of U.S. organizations by 
restricting use of their private funds.</P>
<P>Many organizations that work to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS often reach 
out to commercial sex workers to distribute condoms and offer education on 
safer-sex measures. Signing an official pledge to oppose prostitution could lead 
to further stigmatization of this high risk population, say the groups, and 
would undermine prevention and treatment efforts. Those already infected will be 
discouraged from acknowledging their condition and seeking treatment because of 
a fear of being shunned or abused. Others will not seek out information or 
medical care or may fail to take precautions that stem the spread of HIV/AIDS 
for fear of stigmatization. </P>
<P>The groups say that this policy is at odds with the United States&#8217; own 
HIV/AIDS policies. The premier federal agencies working to stem the spread of 
HIV/AIDS in the United States, including the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention, have found that isolating vulnerable groups like sex workers 
profoundly affects prevention efforts. Denying all funds from the USAID to 
organizations that do not make the pledge is in direct contradiction to this 
long held public health practice, said the ACLU.</P>
<P>While the Alliance for Open Society International and Pathfinder 
International, the organizations represented in the legal challenge, do not 
endorse prostitution, the groups say it is essential that they maintain their 
ability to engage in proven, effective HIV prevention methods with at-risk 
populations. In a landmark opinion, Judge Victor Marrero ruled in this case that 
the pledge requirement violated the First Amendment rights of the two 
organizations by restricting their privately funded speech and by forcing them 
to adopt the government&#8217;s viewpoint in order to remain eligible for funds. 
Today&#8217;s ACLU brief urges the appeals court to uphold Judge Marrero&#8217;s 
opinion.</P>
<P>The ACLU also filed a brief in a related case, <EM>USAID v. DKT International</EM>, in 
the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. DKT International, a 
U.S.-based organization, was denied federal funding when it refused to adopt the 
policy because it would hamper its HIV/AIDS services worldwide. On May 18, 2006, 
Judge Emmet G. Sullivan ruled that the application of the pledge requirement to 
DKT International violated the organization&#8217;s constitutional rights.</P>
<P>Both opinions are now on appeal by the government. Though the outcome of both 
cases will affect only the obligations of the plaintiff organizations under the 
pledge requirement, the decisions will likely have a broad impact on the other 
U.S.-based organizations that have been forced to limit their speech in exchange 
for government funding. </P>
<P>In addition to the ACLU, the organizations that signed onto today&#8217;s brief 
are: AIDS Action, American Foundation for AIDS Research, American Humanist 
Organization, American Jewish World Service, Center for Health and Gender 
Equity, Center for Reproductive Rights, Center for Women Policy Studies, 
Community HIV/AIDS Mobilization Project, Gay Men&#8217;s Health Crisis, Global AIDS 
Alliance, Global Health Council, Global Justice, Guttmacher Institute, Human 
Rights Watch, Institute of Human Rights of Emory University, International 
Planned Parenthood Federation of the Western Hemisphere Region, International 
Women&#8217;s Health Coalition, National Council of Jewish Women, Partners in Health, 
Physicians for Human Rights, Planned Parenthood Federation of America, 
Population Action International, Population Council, Religious Consultation on 
Population, Reproductive Health and Ethics, Sexuality Information and Education 
Council of the United States, the University of California, Berkeley&#8217;s Human 
Rights Center and Dr. Jim Yong Kim, Chair of the Harvard Medical School 
Department of Social Medicine.</P>
<P>The brief&#8217;s authors are Flores and Lenora Lapidus of the ACLU Women&#8217;s Rights 
Project and Caroline Brown, Susannah Vance and Christine Magdo of Covington 
&amp; Burling LLP.</P>
