<p>WASHINGTON - May 11 - <p>   News Advisory:</p>
<p>   -- $60 Million in Drug Company Contributions to GOP Buys Plan  that Sells Out Seniors</p>
<p>   -- Members Will Urge Cancellation of May 15th Sign-Up Deadline  Outside of Reps' Offices</p>
<p>   On Thursday, May 11, MoveOn.org Political Action members in  over one hundred cities nationwide will hold &quot;Caught Red-Handed&quot;  mock check deliveries outside the offices of eighty-one GOP  Representatives. At the events, members will expose what they  believe is the Representatives' record of putting drug company  profits ahead of seniors in the districts.</p>
<p>   MoveOn members, who will express their dissatisfaction with  the GOP passed Medicare prescription drug plan, share the  following views:</p>
<p>   -- Big drug companies spent hundreds of millions of dollars in  campaign contributions and lobbying to get the GOP controlled  Congress to pass the Medicare drug program in 2003.</p>
<p>   -- To corral seniors into the program, President Bush and  Congressional Republicans are going to slap as many as 14 million  un-enrolled seniors with heavy, permanent penalties if they fail  to sign up by the May 15 deadline -- amounting to a &quot;senior tax&quot;  on local seniors.</p>
<p>   &quot;This Republican Medicare drug program does more for the drug  companies than it does for seniors,&quot; said Ben Brandzel, Advocacy  Director for MoveOn Political Action. &quot;And now, Republicans in  Congress are charging seniors with a massive lifetime penalty if  they don't go along with this corrupt program by May 15th.  Congress should stand up to big drug companies and protect  seniors,&quot; Brandzel concluded.</p>
<p>   On Thursday at 12 p.m., MoveOn members across the country will  deliver oversized mock checks to their Members' district offices  showing how much money they accepted from big drug companies.</p>
<p>   Excellent visuals -- crowds ripping up big mock checks.</p>
