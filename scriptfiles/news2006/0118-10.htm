<p>WASHINGTON - January 18 - Consumer Federation of America and Safe Tables Our Priority submitted a letter today (attached)
to the Food and Drug Administration, urging the FDA to prohibit the use of carbon monoxide in
the packaging of fresh meat. A copy of the letter was also sent to Dr. Barbara Masters,
Administrator of USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service.
<p>FDA has established the use of carbon monoxide in packaging of fresh meat as "generally
regarded as safe" (GRAS) in response to two petitions submitted by Precept Foods, Inc., and
Pactiv Corporation. Kalsec, Inc. submitted a citizen's petition on November 15, 2005 requesting
FDA to prohibit the use of carbon monoxide in the packaging of fresh meat. CFA and S.T.O.P.
have submitted a letter to FDA in support of this Kalsec petition.
<p>In the letter, CFA and S.T.O.P. state that FDA's acceptance of the use of carbon monoxide to
displace oxygen in some packaging of case-ready red meat and ground meat products presents
a considerable food safety concern for consumers. Carbon monoxide reacts with myoglobin in
the meat to produce a bright red color, typically an indication of freshness in meat. However, this
coloration has been found to last beyond the time of spoilage, thus masking the meat's true color
and potentially misleading consumers into thinking that the meat is fresher than it actually is. The
use of carbon monoxide thus hides the visual clues that consumers use to determine the safety
and freshness of their meat.
<p>While carbon monoxide itself may not be dangerous to health, CFA and S.T.O.P. hold that it
should not be "generally regarded as safe" when it is used to mask the fact that meat is old
enough to have lost its natural red color. Older meat is more likely to have higher levels of
spoilage and pathogenic bacteria. A bright red color produced by carbon monoxide may disguise
the fact that a meat product has been subject to temperature abuse and therefore could carry a
heavier load of pathogens.
<p>CFA and S.T.O.P. urge FDA to prohibit the use of carbon monoxide in the packaging of fresh
meat and rescind its "no objection" stance on GRAS notifications for Pactiv Corporation and
Precept Foods, Inc.</p>
