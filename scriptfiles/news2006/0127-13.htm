WASHINGTON - January 27 - The nation's leading 
                  history and political science associations, along with a number 
                  of prominent scholars of the Presidency and the Vietnam War, 
                  yesterday filed <a href="Berman%20v%20CIA%20Amicus%20Brief.pdf" target="_blank"><strong>an 
                  amicus brief</strong></a> in a lawsuit brought by University 
                  of California, Davis, Professor Larry Berman. The case involves 
                  Berman's effort to obtain release under the Freedom of Information 
                  Act of two almost 40-year-old CIA memos to President Johnson. 
                </p>
                <p>Represented by Matthew W.S. Estes, the scholars seek to alert 
                  the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit to 
                  the broad implications of the lower court's ruling. </p>
                <p>In the lower court, U.S. District Judge David Levi <a href="PDB_Judge_Levi_vs_Berman.pdf" target="_blank">held 
                  that the CIA may categorically refuse to review for release 
                  all President's Daily Briefs</a>, in perpetuity, regardless 
                  of their content, because the intelligence reports are a protected 
                  intelligence method. Attorney Matthew Estes commented, &quot;Judge 
                  Levi's expansive ruling could reverse 40 years of access to 
                  historical CIA intelligence products. The decision is not required 
                  by the Freedom of Information Act or court precedents and, in 
                  fact, is in direct conflict with applicable Supreme Court holdings 
                  and Congressional action. It also represents poor public policy 
                  that runs counter to the principle that historical presidential 
                  records should be made public that has been cited by the Supreme 
                  Court, Congress and our past Presidents.&quot;</p>
                <p>Further, Judge Levi held that the Briefs also could be categorically 
                  withheld because they are protected by a limitless presidential 
                  privilege for confidential communications with advisers. The 
                  scholars argue that this holding contradicts the Supreme Court's 
                  decision in the Nixon tapes cases that privilege erodes over 
                  time and Congress's clear finding in the 1978 Presidential Records 
                  Act that the privilege no longer applies 12 years after the 
                  president leaves office. Moreover, the rationale for the privilege 
                  makes no sense in light of the extensive public availability 
                  of President Johnson's deliberations, including over 400 hours 
                  of tapes of his oval office conversations. </p>
