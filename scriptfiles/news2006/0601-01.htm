<p>WASHINGTON - June 1 - Today, U.S. District  Court Judge Emmet Sullivan took the rare step of ordering  discovery in the case of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics  in Washington (CREW) v. Department of Justice (DOJ) regarding the  government's last minute change of position in its tobacco  lawsuit.</p>
<p>   Last June, CREW submitted a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)  request to DOJ asking for records relating to the proposed  penalty in United States v. Philip Morris, Inc.  As a penalty for  the tobacco industry's violations of racketeering laws, DOJ had  initially sought $130 billion, at a rate of $5.2 billion per year  over 24 years, to fund a smoking cessation program. Suddenly and  without explanation, in June 2005 DOJ drastically dropped the  amount to only $10 billion, at a rate of $2 billion per year for  five years. </p>
<p>   To learn why DOJ changed its position and to discover if there  was any wrongdoing involved, CREW filed several FOIA requests  with DOJ. Among the information requested, CREW asked for all  contacts between Associate Attorney General Robert McCallum and  his former law firm Alston &amp; Byrd, a firm that represented  tobacco companies. The past spring, President George Bush  nominated McCallum to be the United States' ambassador to  Australia. McCallum and President Bush were classmates at Yale  University.</p>
<p>   Given public interest in the case, CREW asked DOJ to process  its requests on an expedited basis.</p>
<p>   Although DOJ initially agreed to CREW's request for  expedition, nearly a year later, CREW has yet to receive a single  record. As a result, CREW sued, arguing that DOJ's extraordinary  delay in processing the requests constituted bad faith.</p>
<p>   In today's order, Judge Sullivan stated that he was &quot;not  persuaded&quot; that DOJ had, in fact, handled CREW's request in an  expedited manner and that &quot;sufficient question(s)&quot; had been  raised as to the propriety of DOJ's conduct in the manner to  warrant awarding discovery to CREW.  Judge Sullivan ordered CREW  to depose not only McCallum, but also the director of the Office  of Information and Privacy, Daniel Metcalfe, Steve Brody, a  member of the tobacco team, and James Kovakas, the attorney in  charge of the Civil Division's FOIA processing.</p>
<p>   Melanie Sloan, CREW's executive director, stated, &quot;Hopefully,  with these depositions, the American people will begin to learn  the truth about why DOJ so drastically reduced the penalty in the  tobacco case.  It is also gratifying to know that the federal  courts will not allow the Administration to avoid complying with  its legal obligations under the FOIA.&quot; </p>
<p>   A copy of the decision and CREW's FOIA are available on CREW's  Web site, <a href="http://releases.usnewswire.com/redir.asp?ReleaseID=66741&Link=http://www.citizensforethics.org">http://www.citizensforethics.org</a>.</p>
