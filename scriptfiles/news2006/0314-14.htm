<p>SAN JOSE, California - March 14 - At a hearing today before a federal judge, the American Civil 
Liberties Union will urge the court to reject the government&#8217;s demand for 
millions of Google search records, saying that it has not justified the need for 
obtaining massive amounts of consumer information.</P>
<P>&#8220;The government is not entitled to go on a fishing expedition through 
millions of Google searches any time it wants, just because it claims that it 
needs that information,&#8221; said ACLU staff attorney Aden Fine. &#8220;Given the 
government&#8217;s continued vagueness about why it needs these vast quantities of 
consumer records, Google has rightly denied the request.&#8221; <BR>&nbsp;<BR>In legal 
papers filed&nbsp;before Judge James Ware of the U.S. District Court for the Northern 
District of California, the ACLU argued in favor of the Internet search giant&#8217;s 
effort to block the government&#8217;s subpoena for information about its customers&#8217; 
online behavior.&nbsp; </P>
<P>The Google controversy arose in connection with the ACLU's challenge to the 
"Child Online Protection Act" (COPA), which would impose draconian criminal 
sanctions, with penalties of up to $50,000 per day and up to six months 
imprisonment, for online material acknowledged as valuable for adults but judged 
"harmful to minors." <BR>&nbsp;<BR>A federal district court in Philadelphia and 
a federal appeals court found the COPA law unconstitutional, and the Supreme 
Court upheld the ban on enforcement of the law in June 2004.&nbsp; The Justices, 
however, also asked the Philadelphia court to determine whether there had been 
any changes in technology that would affect the constitutionality of the 
statute, such as whether commercially available blocking software was still as 
effective as the banned law in blocking material deemed "harmful to minors." 
<BR>&nbsp;<BR>The government has claimed it needs the Google records for its 
defense of the law.&nbsp; But the ACLU said that the government has failed to 
describe how the millions of Google user records will help it to determine 
whether the software is effective and if the law is constitutional. Government 
papers filed recently in response to the ACLU and Google briefs still do not 
explain how the customer information will be used and why it is necessary, the 
ACLU said.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>The ACLU&#8217;s clients in the COPA challenge, <EM>ACLU v. 
Gonzales</EM>, include Salon.com, Urbandictionary.com,&nbsp; Nerve.com, Condomania, 
Philadelphia Gay News and Dr. Mitch Tepper's &#8220;Sexual Health Network,&#8221; among 
others. </P>
<P>The ACLU has brought other successful challenges to state "harmful-to-minors" 
laws in Michigan, New Mexico, New York, Arizona and Vermont. A case brought in 
Virginia also resulted in a "harmful-to-minors" law being struck down. The ACLU 
noted that the state challenges were successful because of the impossibility of 
verifying the age as well as location of Internet users, as the law 
requires.&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>The law firm Latham &amp; Watkins has been representing the ACLU on the COPA 
case since 1998 and also participated in the successful challenges to similar 
laws in New York and Arizona. The firm is serving as counsel in today&#8217;s Google 
filing as well. </P>
