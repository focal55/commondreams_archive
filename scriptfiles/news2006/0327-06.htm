<p> WASHINGTON - March 27 - With technical and financial support from WWF, Barama became  certified on February 17 for forest management of 570,000 hectares  of tropical natural forest. To celebrate this achievement, a  ceremony took place today, at the Cara Lodge, Georgetown, Guyana,  attended by high-level officials from the Guyana Government, Barama,  WWF, forest authorities, and others.
<p>   WWF's comprehensive support went from training in reduced impact  logging practices, and factory operations that provide a healthy and  safety work environment, to reviewing the company's performance  against the rigorous standards of the FSC.</p>
<p>   &quot;With this milestone, Barama not only serves as a catalyst for  improved forest management systems in the Guianas but also ensures  that the fragile tropical ecosystem is effectively and efficiently  utilized by the company so that the national patrimony is protected  for the benefit of present and future generations,&quot; said Dr. Patrick  Williams, WWF Guianas Programme Officer for Guyana.</p>
<p>   In a country with high unemployment rates, Barama employs at  least 1,500 persons, benefiting approximately 5,000 family members. Before certification, the company was in danger of down-sizing its  operations and reducing its employment levels. Today, Barama's  expansion plan forecasts increasing employment in the area.</p>
<p>   &quot;This is very important for Guyana and for the wider Guianas;  it's a good example of how good social and environmental practices  can improve business as a whole,&quot; said Guyana's Commissioner of  Forests, James Singh. &quot;We hope that Barama's certification serves as  an impetus for other companies to follow and also for the  development of the national standards embarked upon by the Guyana  National Initiative for Forest Certification (GNIFC).&quot;</p>
<p>   This has been a win-win situation for the Barama Company and for  the local people: while the forest company strengthened its  relations with current buyers by seeking forest certification,  employees benefit from a better work environment. For instance,  people working on the concession are allowed to establish their own  team of workers; Barama provides social services for communities  around the concession such as health services, medicines,  transportation in an out of remote areas and emergency assistance.</p>
<p>   The Barama Company certified concession is located in the west- central portion of Guyana, in the northern outer limits of the  Amazon forest in the Guiana Shield, occupying primarily the Cuyuni  River Basin. The company has been in operation for over 15 years:  its main product has been plywood for export markets in the U.S. and  the Caribbean.</p>
<p>   Editor's Note:</p>
<p>   The Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) is an international network  to promote responsible management of the world's forests. FSC brings  people together to find solutions to the problems created by bad  forestry practices and to reward good forest management. Through  consultative processes, it sets international standards for  responsible forest management and accredits independent, third-party  organizations who can certify forest managers and forest product  producers to FSC standards.  The FSC product label allows consumers  worldwide to recognize products that support the growth of  responsible forest management worldwide.</p>
<p>   World Wildlife Fund is the largest conservation organization in  the world. For 45 years, WWF has worked to save endangered species,  protect endangered habitats, and address global threats such as  deforestation, overfishing, and climate change. Known worldwide by  its panda logo, WWF works in 100 countries on more than 2,000  conservation programs. WWF has 1.2 million members in the United  States and nearly 5 million supporters worldwide.
