<p>WASHINGTON  - November 2 - Most people watching the November 7 elections have focused on whether Republicans will maintain control of Congress. But an historic vote is being staged in Lexington that has received surprisingly little coverage outside of Kentucky. <br />
<br />Investors in utility companies as well as customers of American Water or other private water utilities should be watching closely because this referendum likely will settle what is believed to be the longest-running water privatization standoff in the country.<br /><br />Lexington residents will decide whether a public agency should take over the local water system currently owned by a German utility conglomerate called RWE, one of the largest energy companies in the world. Elected officials and citizens in Lexington began trying to gain control of their water system – Kentucky American Water – immediately after RWE purchased it in 2002. Two days after the sale, editors of the Lexington Herald-Leader said “control and decision-making about water is best left to local leaders who can be held accountable,” perhaps not “a profit-driven global behemoth.” <br /><br />RWE, which has annual revenues of $53 billion, has outspent referendum supporters by at least a 10-to-1 margin. The company has spent about $140,000 on television commercials and an additional unknown amount on billboards. The main group supporting the measure has spent $13,500.<br /><br />If the referendum passes, a judge will likely set the price RWE will be paid for Kentucky American through the eminent domain process. While supporters have offered to stop the campaign if the referendum fails, RWE has refused to drop its challenge if it passes. In addition to Lexington’s Fayette County, the referendum covers Kentucky American’s operations in surrounding Bourbon, Clark, Harrison, Jessamine, Scott and Woodford counties.<br /><br />RWE customers throughout North America are closely watching the Lexington referendum as a possible precedent for similar local-control initiatives. All told, the company has 18 million customers in 29 U.S. states and three Canadian provinces. <br /><br />We would be happy to answer questions or provide additional information about this issue. Please contact Maj Fiil-Flynn at (202) 797-6551 or mfiil [at] fwwatch.org.</p><p class="Subheading"><b>Background</b></p><p><br />Based in Essen, Germany, RWE in 2002 bought American Water Works, then the largest investor-owned water company in the United States. American Water in turn owns Kentucky American, which provides water and wastewater service to about 300,000 people in east-central Kentucky – including Lexington.<br /><br />RWE announced plans to sell American Water – including Kentucky American – in November 2005, just three years after purchasing the Voorhees, NJ-based company for $7.6 billion. In addition to Lexington, elected officials and citizens in Felton, Cal.; Champaign-Urbana, Ill.; Chattanooga, Tenn. and several other U.S. cities have asked RWE to sell back their local systems. <br /><br />RWE has refused, saying none of its local operations are for sale despite receiving fair market price offers from municipalities. Instead, the company plans to spin off American Water on Wall Street through an initial public offering in 2007. RWE executives say their plans to create a global water business haven’t panned out, in part due to regulators’ skepticism of rate increases and citizen opposition to a large foreign corporation owning their local water system.<br /><br />Perhaps no community has been more acutely aware of this than Lexington, where RWE has interjected itself in local politics at an unprecedented level. <br /><br />Editors of the Lexington Herald-Leader remarked recently: “Lexington is a pawn in a great global water game.”<br /><br />RWE has forcefully opposed efforts by Lexington citizens to buy back their local water system. When a majority of the Lexington-Fayette Urban County Council came out in favor of taking over the water system through eminent domain, RWE led a campaign in November 2004 to reverse a 9-6 anti-company majority into a 9-6 minority. Then after a local citizens’ group collected 26,000 signatures to place the issue on the ballot a year later, RWE sued on a technicality and blocked the vote by appealing to the Kentucky Supreme Court. <br /><br />Facing growing public opposition, RWE dropped its legal challenge this past May and allowed the referendum to go on the November 2006 ballot. “The best thing for all of us is to let our customers vote,” Kentucky American’s president said. <br /><br />For more information on the Lexington referendum and other water industry issues, contact Maj Fiil-Flynn at (202) 797-6551 or mfiil [at] fwwatch.org.
