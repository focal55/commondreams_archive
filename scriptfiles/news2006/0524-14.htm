SACRAMENTO, California - May 24 - The next  generation of ballistic identification technology, known as  microstamping, passed an historic testing session in California  on Monday.  </p>
<p>     The test was conducted at the California Highway Patrol  range by California State Assemblyman Paul Koretz, a West  Hollywood Democrat. The results were verified by a representative  of the California Criminalistics Institute.</p>
<p>   Microstamping technology utilizes lasers to make precise,  microscopic engravings on the breech face and firing pin of a  gun. As the gun is fired, information including the make and  model of the gun is stamped onto the cartridge. Koretz is the  sponsor of AB-352, a bill that would require gun manufacturers to  include a microstamp on every newly designed and manufactured  handgun. The bill passed the Assembly in 2005, but Koretz agreed  to conduct a demonstration of the technology at the request of  Assemblyman Jay LaSuer, a San Diego Republican, before moving the  legislation to the Senate.  </p>
<p>   "With microstamping technology now proven, pro-NRA legislators  are out of excuses for stalling on AB-352," said Coalition to  Stop Gun Violence Executive Director Joshua Horwitz. "It's time  for the California legislature and Governor to make this historic  legislation law and give police across the state the resources  they need to solve gun crimes and bring justice to the families  and survivors of homicide victims."  </p>
<p>   "This is a very exciting development. The testing was a good  approach to ensure that this new system can live up to its  promise. Now, the time has come to put this technology to work,"  said Michael D. Barnes, president of the Brady Campaign to  Prevent Gun Violence. </p>
<p>   Despite Koretz' efforts to accommodate him, LaSuer failed to  attend Monday's test. "I am very disappointed that Assemblyman  LaSuer decided to back out of the event," said Koretz. "I feel  satisfied that we were able to objectively demonstrate that  microstamping technology works."    </p>
<p>   The technology promises to greatly aid law enforcement  officials in investigating homicides and other crimes by allowing  them to easily trace firearms through shell casings found at  crime scenes. Currently, only 55 percent of homicide  investigations in the state result in the arrest of a suspect,  primarily because of a lack of evidence. For this reason, AB-352  has the support of State Attorney General Bill Lockyer and over  45 police chiefs and sheriffs from across California.</p>
<p>   AB-352 will now be considered by the California Senate.  California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger has yet to indicate  whether he would sign the bill if it reaches his desk.</p>
