<p>WASHINGTON - December 14 - The Sunlight Foundation, a nonprofit focused on transparency in Congress, today set out three elements that must be included in any Congressional upcoming reform proposals -- an agenda endorsed by this morning's New York Times (see below).  

<p>Speaker Pelosi has wisely decided that draining the swamp will be a top priority in the first one hundred hours of the new Congress.  Reforms that provide more openness for Congress would be a great way to beginning establishing more trust between lawmakers to their constituents.  There are three elements that Congress  must consider as it moves to clean itself up, said Ellen Miller, Executive Director of the Sunlight Foundation.

<p>The three elements, backed by Sunlight, are as follows:


<p>1) 21st century public filing -- online!

<p>All currently required public filings by lawmakers should be filed online, in a searchable and downloadable format within 24 hours of the time they are filed in paper form. Sunlight also supports more frequent filing.

<p>2) No more secret, offline legislation

<p>Bills should be posted online at least 72 hours before a vote, so that  Members of Congress and the public have time to read the bills before they vote on them. If a Member of Congress sponsors an earmark or an amendment, he should put his name on it, so everyone knows where legislation is coming from.

<p>3) Real lobbyist disclosure 

<p>Paid lobbyists should have to report who they meet with, and what they discuss, and report any connections they have with Members of Congress. All lobbyists reports should be filed on the Internet, within 24 hours of any meeting.

<p> There is nothing radical about these proposals, said Miller.  In the era of new technology, these are all feasible and they are simply common sense first steps towards making our Congress more open, accountable, and modern. To truly repair the relationship between elected officials and their constituents, which has steadily eroded over the past couple of decades, Congress should enact these proposals.
