<p>PARIS - February 15 - Greenpeace today celebrated President 
Jacques Chirac's decision to call back the decommissioned toxic aircraft 
carrier, the Clemenceau, to France from its journey to the ship-breaking 
yards in Alang, India.

<p>The ship left France on December 31, 2005, under a huge cloud of 
controversy after Greenpeace and other organisations launched a campaign 
to stop the Clemenceau's export to India to be broken up because it 
contains a toxic cocktail of asbestos, PCBs and heavy metals. Greenpeace 
declared that the quantities of hazardous wastes still on board deemed 
the shipment as illegal trade under the Basel Convention - the 
international treaty that prohibits the export of toxic wastes from 
developed nations to non-OECD countries.

<p>"This is a huge victory for the environment, and for the campaign headed 
up by Greenpeace and other organisations," said Pascal Husting, 
Greenpeace France Executive Director. "In today's globalised world it is 
vital that nations, such as France and India, co-operate to uphold 
global justice and not shamelessly pass on their responsibility to those 
in vulnerable areas of the planet".

<p>Yesterday, the government representative on the Council of State - the 
French Supreme Court - recommended the suspension of the transfer of the 
Clemenceau to India, pointing out the possibility that European law may 
have been violated. President Chirac announced the final decision to 
retrieve the aircraft carrier earlier today. Greenpeace also welcomes 
Chirac's announcement that France will work with its partners to develop 
a European infrastructure for decontaminating
decommissioned ships in Europe before eventually sending them for 
scrapping to Asia.

<p>The Clemenceau was one of the largest ships to be sent for scrap but 
every year a vast decrepit armada bearing a dangerous cargo of toxic 
substances including asbestos, PCBs (polychlorinated biphenyls) and 
heavy metals, ends up in Asian ship breaking yards (Bangladesh, India, 
China and Pakistan) where they are cut up using the crudest of methods - 
taking a huge toll on human health and the local environment.

<p>"The Clemenceau became the icon of toxic trade abuse between the 
developed world and developing countries. With President Chirac's 
decision, it now becomes a sign of how Governments, when pressurized by 
public opinion, can take corrective action," said Martin Besieux, 
Greenpeace International Toxics Campaigner. "This incident should set 
the precedent not just for ship-breaking, but for all toxic trade."

<p>Greenpeace is an independent campaigning organisation that uses 
non-violent creative confrontation to expose global environmental 
problems to force solutions that are essential to a green and peaceful 
future.
