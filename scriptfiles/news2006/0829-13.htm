<p>WASHINGTON - August 29 - Parents with lower incomes and less education are  more likely to work alternating schedules than richer and more educated  families, according to a report by the Center for Economic and Policy  Research.&nbsp; White parents are more likely to have similar work  schedules and less &quot;tag-team parenting&quot; than Hispanic or mixed  race/ethnicity families.<br />
    <br />
The report, &quot;<em>Tag-Team Parenting,&quot;</em> by economist Heather  Boushey, looks inside families where parents work alternating schedules  to understand how they balance work and child care. It finds that young,  low-income and less-educated parents are more likely to work different  shifts to provide childcare. To read the report, see: <a href="http://www.cepr.net/publications/work_schedules_2006_08.pdf" eudora="autourl">http://www.cepr.net/publications/work_schedules_2006_08.pdf<br />
<br />
</a>&quot;Many American families cannot afford the luxury of sitting down  together for dinner. Social policy should aim to ensure that working  parents, and workers more generally, are able to balance work and  family,&quot; said Boushey. <br />
<br />
The report finds that:<br />
<br />
-- Less educated parents are more likely to work evening and night  shifts. Among working mothers without a high school degree, only 58.5  percent have a day shift.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
<br />
-- Within two-earner, married-couple families with young children, the  most common kind of childcare is formal daycare (29.4 percent), followed  closely by relative care (27.3 percent), then parental care (25.5  percent). Lower-income two-earner married couples are more likely to use  parental and relative care than higher-income families. <br />
<br />
-- While 27.1 percent of married mothers use parental care, only 10.3  percent of single mothers report parental care as their most common kind  of childcare. <br />
<br />
-- Low-income mothers are more likely to report that they work their  current schedule to address childcare needs (41.5 percent) compared to  those in the top income quartile (30.0 percent).<br />
<br />
-- The older a family is, the more likely it is that the spouses have  similar schedules.<br />
<br />
&ldquo;While some parents choose to work alternating schedules to care for  their children, many families do not have any choice in the matter. It is  all that is available or affordable,&rdquo; said Boushey.
