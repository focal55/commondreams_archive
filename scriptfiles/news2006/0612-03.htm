<p>ORLANDO, Florida - June 12 - A leading Florida  newspaper yesterday published an analysis of incidents of  violence in Central Florida that have occurred since January 1  where the state's new deadly force law was invoked. </p>
<p>   The Orlando Sentinel reported that in five counties in Central  Florida 13 people killed six men and wounded four others, and  that all but one of those shot were unarmed.  The dead include a  man who shook his fist at another man in a neighborhood dispute,  and the wounded include a 15-year old would be car thief shot in  the back of the leg while running away. </p>
<p>   The story can be found at  <a href="http://releases.usnewswire.com/redir.asp?ReleaseID=67334&Link=http://www.orlandosentinel.com/orl-">http://www.orlandosentinel.com/orl-</a> deadlyforce1106jun11,0,2402838.story .</p>
<p>   &quot;The net effect of the new 'Shoot First' law in Florida is,  unfortunately, precisely what we feared,&quot; said Sarah Brady,  honorary chair of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence.   &quot;People are dying who did not deserve to die.  Meanwhile the  legitimate cases of self-defense would have been viewed as  legitimate self-defense without this law.  </p>
<p>   &quot;Florida's legislature should repeal this law.  And other  states thinking of passing this law should stop and look at the  results in Florida,&quot; Brady said.</p>
