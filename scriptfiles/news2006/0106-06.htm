<p>WASHINGTON - January 6 - The Lawyers' Committee  for Civil Rights Under Law ("Lawyers' Committee") has released a  Statement of Opposition to Judge Samuel Alito's nomination to the  Supreme Court. The Statement from the Lawyers' Committee's Board  is signed by more than 100 prominent lawyers from across the  United States and concludes that if confirmed, Judge Alito would  turn back the clock on civil rights enforcement and impede our  progress toward the goal of equal justice for all. </p>
<p>   The Lawyers' Committee's Statement expresses serious concerns  about Alito's 15-year record on the Third Circuit Court of  Appeals as well as his expressed personal views on critical civil  rights issues. The Statement notes that, "Judge Alito does not  possess a sense of fairness or balance in civil rights cases, and  that he would instead bring to future civil rights cases the kind  of ideological commitment that would set back civil rights  enforcement in substantial ways." </p>
<p>   "Judge Alito's restrictive views and narrow interpretations of  civil rights laws have compelled the Lawyers' Committee to oppose  this nomination. The Lawyers' Committee believes that Judge  Alito's troubling views from the 1980s and his current record as  a judge are fully consistent and reflect a considerable  skepticism about the importance of civil rights enforcement,"  said Barbara R. Arnwine, executive director of the Lawyers'  Committee. </p>
<p>   For example:</p>

<p>   -- In Judge Alito's recent responses to the Senate Judiciary  Committee questionnaire he has continued to use inflammatory  "quota" labels to describe race-conscious measures. </p>
<p>   -- Judge Alito's record embraces an interpretation of Title  VII remedies that would preclude affirmative action, despite  repeated Supreme Court holdings rejecting that interpretation. </p>
<p>   -- Judge Alito has advanced a cramped reading of Title VII  that would make it very difficult for minority plaintiffs to  prevail in employment discrimination cases.</p>
<p>   -- Judge Alito's decisions demonstrate that he assigns to  Congress only a narrow authority to remedy discrimination and  reduce inequalities.</p>
<p>   In light of the reasons noted in the Report, the Lawyers'  Committee urges the Judiciary Committee to vote not to confirm  this nominee. </p>
<p>   The full text of the Lawyers' Committee's statement of concern  can be found at <a href="http://releases.usnewswire.com/redir.asp?ReleaseID=58940&Link=http://www.lawyerscommittee.org">http://www.lawyerscommittee.org</a></p>

<p>   <i>The Lawyers' Committee is a nonpartisan, nonprofit civil  rights legal organization, formed in 1963 at the request of  President John F. Kennedy to provide legal services to address  racial discrimination.
