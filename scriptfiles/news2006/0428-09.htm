<p>WASHINGTON - April 28 - Grassroots activists from around the nation who will be meeting here this weekend will be urged by organizers to help support a new coalition of Mayors that was launched Tuesday at a meeting of Mayors organized by Mayors Michael Bloomberg of New York and Thomas Menino of Boston.  </p>
<p>   &quot;We are very, very grateful that the Mayors are beginning to focus public attention on the terrible toll taken by illegal guns on the streets of our American cities,&quot; said Michael D. Barnes, President of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence.  &quot;Our activists at the grassroots are energized tremendously by this, and they are excited about contacting the Mayors in their communities to ask them to join the coalition.&quot;</p>
<p>   &quot;Advocates in cities all over America will help,&quot; said Marsha McCartney, chair of the Million Mom March Chapters National Council.  &quot;The Mayors in our communities want real action taken to combat gun trafficking.  We know they'll step up to the plate.&quot;</p>
<p>   Mayors from 15 cities met at Gracie Mansion in New York City Tuesday and signed on to a Statement of Principles, including support for legislation that helps to combat illegal guns as well as to punish gun offenders.  </p>
<p>   The Million Mom March is a national network of 75 chapters throughout the U.S.  More than 75 activist leaders are in Washington D.C. starting today and continuing this weekend. </p>
<p>   As the nation's largest, non-partisan, grassroots organization leading the fight to prevent gun violence, the Brady Campaign, working with its dedicated network of Million Mom March Chapters, is devoted to creating an America free from gun violence, where all Americans are safe at home, at school, at work, and in our communities. </p>
