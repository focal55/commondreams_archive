<p>DETROIT - December 19 - Filing a lawsuit today on behalf of 19 students, faculty and 
applicants to the University of Michigan, a coalition of civil rights groups 
including the American Civil Liberties Union and the NAACP, are asking a federal 
court to declare that the newly passed Proposal 2 has not changed the Supreme 
Court&#8217;s view, stated as recently as 2003, that it is constitutionally 
permissible for universities to consider race and gender as one factor among 
many in university admissions. 
<P>"We are pleased to be able to represent 
current students and faculty, as well as prospective students, in a case that 
will be the first to evaluate exactly what Proposal 2 means in this state," said 
Kary Moss, Executive Director of the ACLU of Michigan. "The recent decisions by 
the United States Supreme Court made clear that it is entirely within the law 
for universities to consider race or gender as one of many criteria in selecting 
their student body. Proposal 2 should not change that."<BR><BR>The lawsuit, filed in 
U.S. District Court in Detroit, asks the court to issue a "declaratory ruling" 
explaining that Proposal 2 does not ban programs that use race or gender as part 
of the decision-making process in any manner whatsoever. Such a construction of 
the language of Proposal 2 would place an unconstitutional burden on the ability 
of protected groups to advance their interests and rights while leaving other 
members of the community free to advance theirs without any similar burdens. <BR>
<BR>Rev. Wendell Anthony, President of the NAACP, Detroit Chapter, said, 
"Affirmative Action is still the law of the land. Recent events in Michigan 
related to the passage of Proposal 2 have only increased our energy to keep the 
doors of equal opportunity open and accessible for all of America's sons and 
daughters. We have come too far to allow the doors of opportunity to be shut in 
the face of the American promise of liberty and justice."<BR><BR>Proponents of 
Proposal 2, called the "Michigan Civil Rights Initiative," have asserted from 
the beginning that it would not end all affirmative action but, instead, would 
only make it "unconstitutional to pick winners and losers based solely on race 
and sex." <BR><BR>One of the plaintiffs represented in today&#8217;s lawsuit is Chase 
Cantrell, an African American Detroit native who is in his second year at the 
University of Michigan Law School. Cantrell also obtained his BA from the 
university and is the first in his family to attend graduate school. <BR><BR>"After 
many years as a student at the university, I have learned to achieve a better 
understanding of world culture through the eyes of students and faculty from a 
wide range of backgrounds," Cantrell said. "Although I was invited to attend 
Cornell Law School, I chose the University of Michigan because the student body 
is so much more dynamic." <BR><BR>In the 2003 case <EM>Grutter v. University of 
Michigan</EM>, the Supreme Court held that the equal protection clause of the U.S. 
Constitution does not prohibit the narrowly tailored use of race in admissions 
decisions to further a compelling interest in obtaining the education benefits 
that flow from a diverse student body. Moreover, the Supreme Court has found 
that a state law violates the equal protection clause when it makes it more 
difficult for certain racial minorities than for other members of the community 
to achieve legislation that is in their interest. </P><P></P>
<P>The plaintiffs are represented by Melvin Butch Hollowell of the NAACP; Moss, 
Michael Steinberg and Mark Fancher of the ACLU of Michigan; ACLU of Southern 
California Legal Director Mark Rosenbaum; Theodore Shaw and Victor Bolden of the 
NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund; Dennis Parker and Alexis Agathocleous of 
the national ACLU Racial Justice Project; Harvard Law Professor Lawrence Tribe; 
Duke Law Professor Erwin Chemerinsky; and Reginald Turner of Michigan law firm 
Clark Hill. <BR><BR>The complaint is available online at: <A class=noline_blue href="http://www.aclu.org/racialjustice/aa/27741lgl20061219.html">www.aclu.org/racialjustice/aa/27741lgl20061219.html</A>
