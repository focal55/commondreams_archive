<p>WASHINGTON - April 24 - On April 19, four  defendants, arrested at the White House while protesting the Iraq  war by engaging in a die-in on Oct. 26, 2005, had their charges  dismissed in federal court in Washington, D.C.  Judge Deborah  Robinson ruled in favor of the defense motion for a judgment of  acquittal and stated that the prosecution had failed to prove the  case against Gary Ashbeck and Lynn Robinson, from Baltimore, and  Paul Kawika Martin and Eve Tetaz, from Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>   Activists -- including Cindy Sheehan -- were charged with  demonstrating without a permit, which carries a maximum sentence  of six months in jail and a $500 fine.  After the prosecution  rested its case, Ashbeck with advice of attorney advisor, Mark  Goldstone, made a motion for a judgment of acquittal which Judge  Robinson accepted.</p>
<p>   &quot;Today's tremendous victory for free political speech will  only be eclipsed when we bring all of the troops home from Iraq  and help the Iraqi people rebuild their country,&quot; exclaimed Paul  Kawika Martin, political director for Peace Action Education  Fund, who is 36 years old.</p>

<p>   &quot;We received due process and were acquitted.  Now if the  prisoners in Guantanamo could also receive due process, we may  recognize this country as a democracy,&quot; stated Gary Ashbeck.</p>
<p>   &quot;I am obliged to invoke my right under the constitution to  petition my government for a redress of grievances and say that  the country I pledge allegiance to cannot be permitted to commit  these acts of war in my name,&quot; proclaimed Eve Tetaz.</p>
<p>   &quot;The prosecutors outlined lots of ways that we could work to  end the carnage in Iraq without risking arrest. We have tried  these ways, and continue to try them. But we cannot wait for  politicians to end this war. We, the people, must end this  carnage. And we must do so by any peaceful means necessary,&quot;  remarked Lynn Robinson.</p>
<p>   The Peace Action Education Fund is the sister organization of  the nearly 50 year-old Peace Action, the United States' largest  peace and disarmament organization with over 100,000 members and  nearly 100 chapters in 30 states and works to achieve the  abolition of nuclear weapons, promote government spending  priorities that support human needs and encourage a foreign  policy that embodies respect for human rights.  <a href="http://releases.usnewswire.com/redir.asp?ReleaseID=64390&Link=http://www.Peace-">http://www.Peace-</a> Action.org</p>
