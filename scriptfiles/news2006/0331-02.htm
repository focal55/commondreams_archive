<p>On Monday the New York Times reported on the "White House Memo" -- 
secret minutes, taken by a high British official, of a White House 
meeting between President Bush and British Prime Minister Tony Blair in 
January 2003.

<p>Highlights of the memo were first published this year in January in the 
book "Lawless World: America and the Making and Breaking of Global 
Rules," which was written by a British lawyer and international law 
professor, Philippe Sands.

<p>Sands, currently on a brief visit to the U.S., spoke at the New America 
Foundation this afternoon; information on the event is available at the 
webpage <http://www.newamerica.net/index.cfm?pg=event&EveID=550> and 
video will be available.

<p>The Times reported: "The January 2003 memo is the latest in a series of 
secret memos produced by top aides to Mr. Blair that summarize private 
discussions between the president and the prime minister. Another group 
of British memos, including the so-called Downing Street memo written in 
July 2002, showed that the United States was determined to invade Iraq, 
and that the 'intelligence and facts were being fixed around the policy' 
by the Bush administration to fit its desire to go to war."

<p>The Times added: "The memo also shows that the president and the prime 
minister acknowledged that no unconventional weapons had been found 
inside Iraq. Faced with the possibility of not finding any before the 
planned invasion, Mr. Bush talked about several ways to provoke a 
confrontation, including a proposal to paint a United States 
surveillance plane in the colors of the United Nations in hopes of 
drawing fire, or assassinating Mr. Hussein." [see:

<p>A founder of AfterDowningStreet.org, Fertik said today: "In January 
2003, millions of us were protesting around the world. We all knew Bush 
wanted war -- that's why we were protesting! But Bush insisted publicly 
that he did not want war.
<p> "The 'White House Memo' proves that Bush was lying -- saying one 
thing in public while saying the opposite in private. In private, he 
told Tony Blair that war was inevitable, and that it didn't matter if 
WMDs were found or if the U.N. adopted a resolution actually authorizing 
the invasion. ... Bush wanted war, no matter what."

<p>JONATHAN SCHWARZ, <a href="mailto:jonathan_schwarz@sbcglobal.net">jonathan_schwarz@sbcglobal.net</a>, <a href="http://tinyrevolution.com" target="_new">http://tinyrevolution.com</a>
<p> Schwarz has been a contributor to AfterDowningStreet.org and has 
followed the various leaked memos closely. He said today: "The most 
shocking aspect of the 'White House Memo' is that George Bush advocated 
the U.S. and U.K. manufacture a pretext for war by flying a U.S. spy 
plane over Iraq in false U.N. colors -- in hopes Iraq would fire upon it.
<p>"This demonstrates Bush knew the U.S. case for war was extremely 
unconvincing. Rather than forego war, however, he and Blair were willing 
to deceive both their own people and the entire world."
