<p>WASHINGTON - May 22 - The following is a  statement by Paul Blank, campaign director for WakeUpWalMart.com,  on Target's announcement of possible &quot;Wal-Mart-like&quot; changes to  its company health care plan:</p>
<p>   Target's announcement that it may eliminate traditional health  care plans for its workers confirms our worst fears of Wal-Mart's  growing negative impact on America's workers.</p>

<p>   While Target may think adopting a &quot;Wal-Mart-like health care  model&quot; will save the company money, such a change could prove  very costly.  Not providing affordable health care is one of the  main reasons Wal-Mart faces an unprecedented grassroots campaign,  mounting public opposition, and a political backlash.</p>
<p>   More than any other retailer in America, Target's public image  is inextricably linked to its success.  As Target well knows, its  core customers, mainly middle-income and upper-middle income  Americans, shop at Target not only for a better value, but  because they believe Target is a better employer and company than  Wal-Mart.  For Target to become more like Wal-Mart, not only puts  Target's better public image at risk, but directly threatens one  of Target’s main competitive advantages against Wal-Mart.</p>
<p>   We, like Target’s customers, believe Target wants to be a  better company than Wal-Mart.</p>
<p>   In that spirit, we would hope, rather than follow Wal-Mart’s  failed health care model, Target will work with us to ensure  Target’s good public image always matches up to reality.  The  truth is the American people and Target’s customers expect no  less.</p>
