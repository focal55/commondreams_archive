<p>Please RSVP to Carah Ong, Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation; (202) 546-0795 ext. 122; (202) 378-3334 (cell); <a href="mailto:cong@armscontrolcenter.org">cong@armscontrolcenter.org</a>. 

 

<p>Iranian development of a nuclear weapon, while not the end of the world as some have suggested, would adversely affect US, regional, and global security, and would add to the risk that nations or non-state actors might one day use nuclear weapons.  This outcome can be avoided, in part, by a smart US nonproliferation strategy.  On the other hand, ill-conceived or poorly executed US actions my have the counter-productive effect of making an Iranian bomb even more likely.  The importance of getting this right and the complexity of the challenge are apparent but all the more obvious given recent events in Israel and Lebanon.   

 

<p>Dr. Walsh is available for comment on the nature of Iran’s nuclear ambitions; the current state and likely prospects of the negotiations between Europe and Iran; US policy options and possible alternatives to those options; and the important role for Congress in resolving the nuclear issue.
