<p>WASHINGTON - May 17 - A new report on children  and health, partly funded by the U.S. government, underscores the  folly of weakening public right-to-know standards for toxic  pollutants, the non-profit Clean Air Watch warned this morning.</p>
<p>   The report, released this morning by the Commission for  Environmental Cooperation, a North American environmental  watchdog agency, examines the link between children's health and  toxic industrial pollution.  </p>
<p>   The report -- available at <a href="http://releases.usnewswire.com/redir.asp?ReleaseID=65926&Link=http://www.cec.org">http://www.cec.org</a> -- comes as  Congress is about to debate efforts by the Bush administration to  limit the public's right to know about toxic releases by  industry.</p>
<p>   In contrast, the new study calls for efforts to better  determine the sources, levels of exposure, and risks that  industrial chemicals pose to children's health. </p>
<p>   The report focuses on the releases of carcinogens,  developmental and reproductive toxicants, and suspected  neurotoxins, as reported by the U.S. Toxics Release Inventory  (TRI) and a counterpart Canadian program. It finds that lead,  mercury, PCBs, dioxins and furans, phthalates and manganese are  substances of either significant or emerging concern as they  affect children and disease. </p>
<p>   One report recommendation -- to enhance mandatory pollution  reporting requirements -- &quot;stands in stark contrast to the Bush  administration's plan to weaken the public's right to know about  toxic releases,&quot; noted Frank O'Donnell, president of the non- profit Clean Air Watch. </p>
<p>   The EPA has proposed to reduce the frequency of TRI reporting  by industry to every other year as well as to allow companies to  release ten times the amount of toxics before detailed reporting  is required. </p>
<p>   The Bush plan has prompted Reps. Frank Pallone (D-N.J.) and  Hilda Solis (D-Calif.) to announce they will challenge the EPA  rule when the spending legislation for the EPA reaches the House  floor, probably later this week.  They plan to offer an amendment  to prevent the EPA from moving forward with these weakening  changes. </p>
<p>   In addition to ranking clusters of toxic chemicals according  to volume of total reported releases, the new report also  examines chemicals based on the relative levels of their  toxicity.</p>
<p>   Doing this makes some air pollutants such as mercury appear  far more significant, O'Donnell noted. For example, in looking at  chemicals that are recognized developmental and reproductive  toxicants, mercury and its compounds jump from 14th in terms of  total on-site air releases to number one in terms of toxicity;  lead and its compounds shift from 7th to the second most toxic  on-site air release.</p>
<p>   O'Donnell noted it was ironic that the report was released on  what the EPA has called &quot;National Air Quality Awareness Week&quot; --  a label that has been lampooned by some critics because of  administration efforts to weaken clean-air requirements.</p>
