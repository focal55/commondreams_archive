<p>WASHINGTON - September 22 - U.S. Senators Russ Feingold (D-WI) and John 
          McCain (R-AZ) have written a letter to President Bush to enlist his 
          continued support for independent review of Army Corps of Engineers 
          projects. In July, the Senate passed the Water Resources Development 
          Act (WRDA) which included a Feingold-McCain amendment authorizing independent 
          review of corps projects. During consideration of the Senate WRDA bill, 
          the administration weighed in on behalf of reforming the Corps, including 
independent peer review. </p>
        <p>&#8220;To not learn from the lessons of Hurricane Katrina would be 
          a colossal failure on the part of Congress,&#8221; Feingold said. &#8220;I 
          look forward to the President&#8217;s continued support of commonsense 
          provisions aimed at fixing how the Army Corps of Engineers operates. 
          The Senate WRDA bill ends &#8216;business as usual&#8217; for the Corps 
          and it is essential that the final bill passed by Congress reflect these 
          post-Katrina lessons, as well.&#8221;</p>
          
        <p>&#8220;It is imperative that we concentrate our efforts on improving 
          the effectiveness of the Army Corps of Engineers,&#8221; McCain said. 
          &#8220;Indeed, human lives could depend on it. Independent review of 
          the Army Corps projects is necessary to encourage budgetary responsibility 
          and ensure that the horrors of Katrina are not repeated.&#8221; </p>
          
        <p>The Senate Homeland Security Committee&#8217;s investigation of Hurricane 
          Katrina revealed that water resource and development projects sanctioned 
          and constructed by the Army Corps of Engineers contributed to this catastrophe. 
          The Army Corps of Engineers&#8217; own Katrina report, issued on June 
          1, 2006, concluded that design flaws in the levees were a major factor 
          in the devastating flooding of New Orleans. The WRDA bill is currently 
          in conference to work out differences between the Senate version and 
          the House version, which passed in July 2005 prior to Hurricane Katrina. 
          Feingold and McCain also wrote to Senate leadership earlier this week 
          urging them to work to retain the Senate-passed reforms.</p>
