<p>WASHINGTON  - April 18 - Last Friday, the Newark Star-Ledger&#160;<a href="http://www.nj.com/columns/ledger/moran/index.ssf?/base/columns-0/1144990540306650.xml&amp;coll=1">ran an amazing column</a> [registration required] by Ledger columnist Tom Moran.&#160; The column focused on a woman from Newark who contracted HIV from a contaminated syringe.&#160; Moran took the New Jersey legislature to task for its continued inaction in the face of the ongoing suffering and death caused by injection-related AIDS.</p>

<p>While New Jersey has some of the highest rates of HIV in the nation, it remains one of only two states with no access to sterile syringes to stop the spread of deadly diseases such as HIV and hepatitis C.&#160; Two bills that would allow access to sterile syringes continue to languish in the state legislature.&#160; These two bills passed the Assembly last year but stalled in the Senate Health Committee.&#160; During his gubernatorial campaign Governor Corzine promised to work for passage of the bills.&#160;&#160;<a href="http://actioncenter.drugpolicy.org/action/index.asp?step=2&amp;item=29765&amp;ms=NJSryinge041706-ip">New Jersey needs action now to save lives!</a></p>

<p>Please take a moment to&#160;<a href="http://actioncenter.drugpolicy.org/action/index.asp?step=2&amp;item=29765&amp;ms=NJSryinge041706-ip">send a fax</a>&#160;to Governor Jon S. Corzine, Senate President Richard J. Codey, and Assembly Speaker Joseph J. Roberts, Jr. asking them to work for passage of these life saving bills.&#160;&#160;</p>

<p>In addition please write or call Senate President Richard J. Codey to express your support for syringe access and urge him to act.&#160; Phone calls and personal letters make more of an impact than faxes or emails.</p>

<p>The Honorable Richard J. Codey<br />
449 Mount Pleasant Avenue<br />
West Orange, NJ 07052<br />
973.731.6770</p>

<p>Senate President Codey was one of the first legislators in New Jersey to support syringe access, co-sponsoring the first syringe access bill in 1993.&#160; Now he must urge his fellow senators to do the right thing and support syringe access.&#160; These bills must not be allowed to stall again in the Senate.&#160; Personal calls and letters show elected officials how much you really care about an issue.</p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>Roseanne Scotti<br />
