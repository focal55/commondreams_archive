<p>WASHINGTON - November 10 - Today, we remember those who have protected our country and the freedoms that we cherish. Our veterans and their families have made great personal sacrifices, and their contributions have touched all of our lives. As we welcome home a new generation of veterans serving in Iraq and Afghanistan, we are reminded of how much these brave men and women, and the veterans who came before them, have done for our country. We must ensure that their heroic service, which is much lauded during times of conflict, is not forgotten once the battles have ended and our troops come home. On Veterans Day, and throughout the year, let us continue to honor America's brave veterans and their families.
