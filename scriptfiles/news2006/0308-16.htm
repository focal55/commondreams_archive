<p>LONDON - March 8 - The international aid organization Action Against Hunger (ACF) launched its advocacy program Hunger Watch today from its UK office with a report released in conjunction with International Women’s Day highlighting the importance of women in the fight against hunger.

 

<p>Entitled ‘Women and Hunger: Women’s central role in the fight against hunger’, the report, which is based on over 25 years of program experience, reviews the difficulties and inequalities facing women throughout the world and the often unmanageable workload met by women through time-consuming tasks. “Women are expected to fetch water, gather firewood, prepare the meals, care for their children, clean the house, and work in the field,” said Cathy Skoula, executive director for ACF’s USA office. “Yet many times programs do not take this workload into account, ignoring the impact of women on the well-being of their families when designing programs.” 

 

<p>Noting that women often play an important role in securing food within the household, the report also highlights the specific vulnerabilities women can face when food is not readily available, especially in times of conflict, economical decline or as a result of pandemics such as HIV/AIDS. 

 

<p>The report goes on to recommend that humanitarian partners—striving to end hunger in the 21st century—should acknowledge that women are the more efficient partner in development, and ensure that their program activities are based on a gender analysis that recognizes power relations and the use and distribution of resources. Noting that humanitarian programs can reverse gender inequalities and serve as a catalyst for change, the report highlights how humanitarian organizations can make a difference if gender issues are considered not as an additional factor but as a core part of their programs. According to ACF, women are the main providers of food around the world; hence the solution to hunger ought to be found in consultation and participation with women. 

 

<p>The report, produced out of ACF’s UK office, is the first of a number of reports to be published as part of the organization’s Hunger Watch project, which aims at analyzing and advocating on hunger to better understand hunger in terms of causes, responsibilities and responses required.
