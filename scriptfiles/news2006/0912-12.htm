<p>WASHINGTON - September 12 - In remarks before the Arab American Institute 
          today, U.S. Senator Russ Feingold called on the President to stop using 
          the phrase &#8220;Islamic fascists,&#8221; an offensive and misleading 
          term. The administration has used this phrase increasingly when talking 
          about al Qaeda, its affiliates and its sympathizers. Feingold says the 
          use of the term &#8220;Islamic fascists&#8221; actually hurts our efforts 
          in fighting terrorism globally because it alienates peaceful Muslims 
around the world whose support we need in fighting terrorism.</p>
        <p>&#8220;I call on the President to stop using the phrase &#8220;Islamic 
          fascists&#8221;, a label that doesn&#8217;t make any sense, and certainly 
          doesn&#8217;t help our effort to build a coalition of societies to fight 
          terrorism,&#8221; Feingold said. &#8220;The President has often correctly 
          referred to Islam as a religion of peace, but this reckless language, 
          much like his prior reference to the fight against al Qaeda as a &#8216;crusade,&#8217; 
          completely cuts the other way. Fascist ideology doesn&#8217;t have anything 
          to do with the way global terrorist networks think or operate, and it 
          doesn&#8217;t have anything to do with the overwhelming majority of 
          Muslims around the world who practice the peaceful teachings of Islam.&#8221;</p>
        <p>During his remarks, Feingold also addressed national security issues, 
          highlighting the need to refocus our attention on al Qaeda and other 
          terrorist networks instead of getting bogged down in Iraq, which had 
          no connection to the 9/11 attacks. He also discussed how we can protect 
          the rights and freedoms of law-abiding Americans as we fight terrorism.</p>
