<p>WASHINGTON - March 7 - Last week during the Senate Energy Committee’s hearing on the Fiscal Year 2007
Budget, Chairman Domenici praised Secretary Norton and the Department of
Interior for promoting "environmentally-gentle" oil development in the
Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.&nbsp;&nbsp; Just days after these remarks,
America got an unfortunate preview of just how "gentle" oil drilling
operations could be if allowed on the Arctic Refuge’s fragile Coastal Plain.</span>
<span><font face="Arial" size="2">On Thursday, March 2, a BP oil operator
discovered signs of an oil spill at a caribou migration site on the snow-covered
tundra of Alaska’s North Slope.&nbsp; Three days later, response workers
finally uncovered the source of the spill – a breach in an oil transit
pipeline feeding into the larger trans-Alaska oil pipeline infrastructure
stretching some 800 miles across the state.</font></span></p>
<p><span><font face="Arial" size="2">Clean-up crews have already vacuumed up
more than 50,000 gallons of crude oil and melted snow off the delicate tundra
but at least one report from an industry expert has indicates that this spill
could be the largest crude oil spill in the history of North Slope – second in
Alaska only to the 1989 <i>Exxon Valdez</i> oil spill.&nbsp; Oil is still
dripping from the breached pipeline and the full extent of the damage and
affected acreage are unknown. The multi-agency spill response team will attempt
to come up with an estimated spill volume in the next two days.</font></span></p>
<p><span><font face="Arial" size="2">This weekend’s accident is just one in a
long history of substantial spills seen on Alaska’s fragile North Slope since
development began there.&nbsp; In fact, despite industry hype about the safety
of development and new technology, the Prudhoe Bay oil fields and Trans-Alaska
Pipeline have caused an average of 504 spills annually on the North Slope since
1996, according to the Alaska’s own Department of Environmental Conservation.&nbsp;
Past spills have included a 300,000 crude oil spill from the Trans-Alaska
pipeline that was detected as far as 166 miles away; a 110,000 gallon crude oil
spill caused by a bulldozer which created a geyser that spewed oil over 20 acres
of tundra wetlands; the infamous 285,000 gallons of crude oil that spilled into
the boreal forest after a local hunter shot the pipeline with a high powered
rifle; and the disastrous 675,000 gallons that were leaked after a saboteur
exploded a two inch hole in the pipeline just a few miles north of Fairbanks.&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p><span><font face="Arial" size="2">As crews of up to 70 people work 12-hour
shifts around the clock to clean up after this massive oil spill, we are sadly
reminded that there is no such thing as "environmentally gentle" oil
drilling.&nbsp; Some places, like America’s Arctic Refuge, are just too
important to be put at risk for a speculative oil fix.&nbsp;</font></span></p><!-- #EndEditable -->
