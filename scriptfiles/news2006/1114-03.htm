<p>BOSTON - November 14 - Twelve lesbian and gay  veterans of the war on terror yesterday filed a brief in the  First Circuit Court of Appeals, in Massachusetts, challenging the  constitutionality of the federal &quot;Don't Ask, Don't Tell&quot; ban on  lesbian, gay and bisexual service personnel. The case, Cook v.  Rumsfeld, was filed on behalf of the plaintiffs by Servicemembers  Legal Defense Network (SLDN) and the law firm of Wilmer Cutler  Pickering Hale and Dorr LLP. The appeal challenges an April  decision by the District Court which dismissed the lawsuit.</p>
<p>   The Cook lawsuit, filed in December 2004, asserts that &quot;Don't  Ask, Don't Tell&quot; punishes gay, lesbian and bisexual service  members for their sexual orientation and for their private,  constitutionally protected conduct. As a result, the plaintiffs  argue, it has denied and continues to deny them several  Constitutional rights, including the right of privacy, equal  protection of the law and freedom of speech. The challenge to  &quot;Don't Ask, Don't Tell,&quot; the plaintiffs' brief asserts, is  &quot;grounded in the basic principles of identity, equality and  freedom.&quot;</p>
<p>   &quot;These twelve patriotic gay Americans continue their proud  traditions of service to our country by fighting to topple 'Don't  Ask, Don't Tell,'&quot; said C. Dixon Osburn, executive director of  SLDN. &quot;The military's gay ban is not only unfair, but it also  contradicts many of the freedoms envisioned in our nation's  constitution. We should honor lesbian and gay patriots who serve  our country, not deny them the very freedom and dignity they  fight to protect. We are optimistic that the First Circuit will  grant these twelve men and women their much-deserved day in  court.&quot;</p>
<p>   The plaintiffs in Cook v. Rumsfeld all served honorably in the  United States Army, Navy, Air Force and Coast Guard. Together,  they have served more than 65 years in the armed forces. Three  have served in direct support of operations in the Middle East.  Collectively, they have earned more than five dozen awards,  medals and commendations. Among the plaintiffs in the lawsuit  are:</p>
<p>   -- Former Navy Lieutenant Jenny Kopfstein. Kopfstein, a  graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy, patrolled the nation's  borders in the wake of the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.  LTJG Kopfstein's command declined to discharge her for two years  after learning she is a lesbian.</p>
<p>   -- Former Army Sergeant First Class Stacy Vasquez. Vasquez  served nearly 10 years as an Army paralegal and was one of the  top recruiters in the Army. Vasquez was discharged after being  outed by a fellow service member's wife.</p>
<p>   -- Former Air Force Sergeant David Hall. Hall, who served for  five years as an enlisted member of the U.S. Air Force before  joining the Air Force ROTC program at the University of Alaska,  was ranked first in his ROTC class. After serving in Saudi Arabia  and Kuwait, Hall was fired when a fellow cadet and friend outed  him to his command.</p>
<p>   The brief filed Monday states, in part, that &quot;Nearly thirteen  years of experience under ('Don't Ask, Don't Tell') -- following  12 years of experience under the prior gay-exclusion regulation - - confirm that gay service members have not hurt military  operations, impaired discipline or posed a risk to unit cohesion.  Yet in response to this non-existent threat, 'Don't Ask, Don't  Tell' has shattered careers, deprived the United States of the  service of dedicated and skilled professionals, and demeaned all  service members' capacity for tolerance and professionalism.&quot;</p>
<p>   The brief goes on to say that, &quot;'Don't Ask, Don't Tell' ...  embodies a startling disconnect: At a time when the military is  experiencing well-documented recruiting difficulties, and has  been reduced to bending the rules to fill its ranks, ... the  Armed Forces continue to discharge distinguished service members  in substantial numbers simply because they are gay. ... These  discharges occur even as the majority of Americans recognize that  there is nothing inconsistent between being gay and serving  honorably.&quot;</p>
<p>   The plaintiffs' brief asserts that the April District Court  decision inappropriately denied the 12 veterans their day in  court and wrongly interpreted the Supreme Court's decision in  Lawrence v. Texas, which struck down state sodomy laws.</p>
<p>   &quot;Every qualified American who wishes to serve our country  should be allowed to do so, regardless of sexual orientation,&quot;  Osburn said. &quot;We are confident in the strength of our case, and  believe the days of 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell' are numbered.&quot;</p>
