<FONT size=2><b><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Tuesday's
        Vote to Decide the Fate of&nbsp;Bush's Tax Cuts for Wealthy</FONT></b></FONT>
<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Alarmed by slumping poll numbers, President Bush and Vice-President Cheney have continued their efforts to <A class="" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/02/us/politics/02elect.html">convince the public</A> that
      Democrats will sink the economy if they take&nbsp;a majority in either
      chamber of Congress on Tuesday. Cheney recently targeted Ways and Means
      Committee ranking member Charlie Rangel (D-NY), who will become the chairman
      of the tax-writing committee if Democrats take a majority in the House,
      and who has indicated that he might allow tax breaks for the wealthiest
  families to expire at the end of 2010. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">While it's not
      clear which Bush tax cuts will be&nbsp;allowed to expire&nbsp;under Democratic leadership, tax breaks for large estates, capital gains and dividends would&nbsp;probably&nbsp;be among them. The popular "marriage penalty" relief and the increased child&nbsp;credits
      would probably be extended or made permanent. Democratic leaders have also
  pledged to revive the pay-as-you-go (PAYGO) rules that were the <A class="" href="http://www.ctj.org/pdf/budget0606.pdf">only procedural reform</A> that helped eliminate budget deficits in the past, end certain tax breaks for large oil companies, and make college tuition permanently deductible.

      <STRONG>Tennessee</STRONG> - <A class="" href="http://state.tn.us/sos/election/ConstitutionAmendments.pdf">Amendment 2</A> - allowing (but not requiring) local governments to enact senior-citizens property tax freezes.

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Each of these proposals are designed to provide property tax breaks for certain families, but take radically different approaches to doing so. Arizona's limit would restrict property tax growth for all taxpayers in a given district; South Dakota's proposal would narrow the scope of these breaks in a hard-to-defend way by allowing tax cuts only for taxpayers whose property is rapidly becoming more valuable; Georgia's would give tax cuts to seniors at all income levels. Tennessee's proposal would give locals a fairly well-crafted new tool for relieving property taxes on fixed-income seniors.</font></P>

    campaign <A href="http://badgerherald.com/news/2006/04/18/green_doyle_butt_he.php"><FONT color=#771100>responded</FONT></A> that “Green
