<p>WASHINGTON - September 21 - The following  statement was released by Paul Blank, campaign director for  WakeUpWalMart.com, on Wal-Mart's announcement of a generic drug  program:</p>
<p>   &quot;While lowering prescription drug costs is a good thing, Wal- Mart cruelly ignores the fact that it fails to provide company  health care to over half (775,000) of its employees which leaves  46 percent of its workers' children uninsured or on public health  care. </p>
<p>   &quot;Even worse, the Wal-Mart health care crisis will continue to  cost American taxpayers over $1.2 billion every year and is  projected to cost taxpayers $9.1 billion over the next five  years. Tragically, Wal-Mart wants the American people to ignore  the fact its so-called low prices come at a high cost to its  workers, children and their families. </p>
<p>   &quot;Wal-Mart needs to answer one very simple, but serious  question -- why not just improve the health care coverage of its  employees? </p>
<p>   &quot;The truth is that the Wal-Mart health care crisis grows  everyday, and sadly this prescription drug initiative will not  insure one additional Wal-Mart employee, one uninsured child, or  reduce the billions of cost for taxpayers.&quot;
