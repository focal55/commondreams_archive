<p>WASHINGTON - February 14 - In response to an anti- union organization's launch yesterday, Citizens for  Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) sent a letter  today to the Chair and Ranking Members of the Senate Finance  Committee, Sens. Charles Grassley (R-Iowa) and Max Baucus (D- Mont.) respectively, requesting an investigation into the  activities of lobbyist Richard Berman, his newest front group,  the Center for Union Facts (CUF) and his other non-profit, the  Center for Consumer Freedom (CCF).</p>
<p>   Yesterday, CUF ran full-page newspaper ads in the Washington  Post, the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal, claiming  that union leaders helped bankrupt steel, auto and airline  companies.  A copy of the ad is available at  <a href="http://releases.usnewswire.com/redir.asp?ReleaseID=60993&Link=http://www.citizensforethics.org">http://www.citizensforethics.org</a>.</p>
<p>   Berman is the president and sole owner of a for-profit  lobbying and public relations firm, Berman &amp; Co., Inc. (BCI),  which has long served the interests of the tobacco, alcohol and  chain restaurant industries.  In November 2004, CREW sent a  letter to the IRS asking for an investigation into Berman's and  CCF's multiple violations of IRS law.  CREW had copied Sens.  Grassley and Baucus on the complaint, but never received a  response.</p>
<p>   Today, CREW asked Sens. Grassley and Baucus to investigate  whether CCF and CUF are engaged in charitable activities or  whether they are in fact, merely front organizations for for- profit industry entities.  </p>
<p>   &quot;Mr. Berman's pattern of abusing the laws that govern  charitable organizations requires a thorough investigation by the  Senate Finance Committee,&quot; CREW executive director Melanie Sloan  said today. &quot;Richard Berman is giving Jack Abramoff and former  Christian activist Ralph Reed a run for their money as to who can  reap the greatest profits by exploiting laws intended to promote  charitable works.&quot;</p>
<p>   Both the letter and accompanying exhibits are available at  <a href="http://releases.usnewswire.com/redir.asp?ReleaseID=60993&Link=http://www.citizensforethics.org">http://www.citizensforethics.org</a>. </p>
