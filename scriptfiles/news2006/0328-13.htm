<p> SIOUX FALLS, South Dakota - March 28 - The American Civil Liberties Union today filed a class 
action lawsuit in federal court against the Winner School District in South 
Dakota, charging that the District maintains an environment hostile to Native 
Americans by, among other things, disciplining Native American students more 
harshly than Caucasians and by forcing them to sign &#8220;confessions&#8221; for minor rule-
breaking, which often leads to juvenile court convictions. 
<P>&#8220;The treatment received by Native American students in Winner and throughout 
the region is completely different than that of their white counterparts,&#8221; said 
Jennifer Ring, Executive Director of the ACLU of the Dakotas. &#8220;These experiences 
demonstrate the reasons why Native American children so often fail to reach 
graduation -- hostility of peers, discrimination of school officials and 
knee-jerk police involvement.&#8221; </P><P>ACLU national staff attorney Catherine Kim 
said the problems in Winner are part of a nationwide trend of &#8220;get tough&#8221; 
policies on school misconduct, which lead to increases in suspensions for 
trivial conduct and the use of law enforcement to handle minor school 
discipline. According to Kim, research consistently shows that students of color 
are far more likely than Caucasian students to feel the brunt of this trend, 
which advocates refer to as the &#8220;school-to-prison pipeline.&#8221; <BR>Nationwide, 
minority students are suspended at rates of two to three times that of other 
students, according to studies by youth law experts. They are also more likely 
to be subjected to office referrals, corporal punishment, and expulsion.&nbsp; <BR>
<BR>&#8220;Winner is a prime example of the national school-to-prison trend,&#8221; Kim 
said. &#8220;Minority students are being pushed out of the classroom and into jail 
cells at alarming rates and for very minor wrongdoings.&#8221;&nbsp; Native American 
students in Winner are three times more likely than their Caucasian counterparts 
to be suspended, and ten times more likely to be referred to law 
enforcement.&nbsp; <BR>&nbsp;<BR>At the heart of the class-action complaint 
filed today is the issue of coerced confessions at the Winner Middle and High 
Schools in Tripp County. The ACLU said the principals of the schools have been 
singling out Native American students for perceived violations of school rules, 
and then forcing them to write a &#8220;confession,&#8221; which is in fact a legal 
document. The principal, having acted in a law enforcement capacity, then calls 
the police, who come to the school and take the child into custody often without 
notifying parents, and forwards the &#8220;confessions&#8221; to the Tripp County State&#8217;s 
Attorneys.&nbsp; These prosecutors, both of whom serve as legal counsel for the 
Winner School District, use the confession to secure a conviction against the 
child in juvenile court. </P>
<P>Dana Hanna, the Attorney General of the Rosebud Sioux Tribe and an ACLU 
cooperating attorney in today&#8217;s lawsuit, noted that while the school district is 
the second largest employer in the county, only two employees out of more than 
100 are Native American.&nbsp; That disparity is reflected in the treatment of 
Native American students, he said. </P>
<P>&#8220;According to the Winner School District&#8217;s own statistics, only two children 
were punished for racial harassment between September of 2003 and June of 2005,&#8221; 
Hanna said.&nbsp; &#8220;Native American students are accused of gang-related 
activities for walking in groups of three or more or wearing bandanas, while 
their white counterparts are encouraged to wear bandanas at sporting 
events.&nbsp; And Native Americans are actively discouraged from participating 
in sports activities.&#8221;</P>
<P>Out of Winner Elementary School&#8217;s 340 students, 30 percent are Native 
American, while only 14 percent of the 320 Winner High School students are 
Native American.&nbsp; Between two and four Native American students have 
graduated from Winner High School in recent years. Students seeking a less 
punitive environment often have no choice but to leave behind their Rosebud 
Sioux Tribe community and board at schools located outside the county. </P>
<P>&#8220;Native American students are doomed before they start in Winner, and that is 
the plan,&#8221; said ACLU senior staff attorney Robin Dahlberg. &#8220;The Native American 
student population plummets in the higher grades because these kids can no 
longer bear the discrimination.&#8221;</P>
<P>Last June, acting on behalf of 14 Native American families, the ACLU filed a 
complaint with the U.S. Department of Education&#8217;s Office of Civil Rights, 
documenting the racial harassment and discriminatory discipline in Winner 
schools.&nbsp; But the Office of Civil Rights did not respond until March 2006, 
nine months later, and by then, most of the complainants had left the district 
-- either transferring to other districts, dropping out of school, or becoming 
incarcerated.&nbsp; Today&#8217;s federal class-action lawsuit seeks to challenge not 
only the discrimination, but also the unlawful policy of coercing confessions 
from Native American students.&nbsp; </P>
