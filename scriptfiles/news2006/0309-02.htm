<p>WASHINGTON - March 9 - "Now, it should be incandescently clear that no one who has any concern for the integrity and life of America today can ignore the present war." Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. 1967

<p>Over 4 years after U.S. centers of military and financial imperialism were attacked, the U.S. military and coalition forces continue to occupy Afghanistan and Iraq.

<p>Tens of thousands have died, too often suffering is used to describe the standard of living of Afghans and Iraqis, electricity, water and sewage systems destroyed, thousands incarcerated and tortured, clashes amongst communities ignited etc.

<p>Afghanistan is reported to be the source of over 50% of the world's opium.  The world consensus is that motivation for the U.S. invasion of Iraq was oil.  No weapons of mass destruction were found in Iraq until the foreign militaries brought and used those weapons.  There was never any evidence that Iraq had any connection with the attacks on 9/11. 
The "war on terrorism" is no more honest than the "war on drugs" is about drugs.

<p>Hip Hop is not an imperialist culture, nor can it afford not to challenge imperialism.  We call on Hip Hop Headz around the world to fight to end the occupations of Afghanistan and Iraq.

<p>The signed organizations support and will participate in the Youth and Students Against the War! on March 16th and international protest against the war and occupation of Afghanistan and Iraq on March 20th spearheaded by National Youth and Student Peace Coalition and United for Peace and Justice.

<p>We demand an immediate cease fire on the part of U.S. and coalition forces against the Afghanistan and Iraqi national liberators.  

<p>We call for the boycott of corporations that participate and profit from the colonization of Afghanistan and Iraq.

<p>We call on the opposition to any candidate running for office that does call for a gradual withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan and Iraq.

<p>Become committed, creative and have the confidence to reason, the courage to bring about change and to Slam War!
