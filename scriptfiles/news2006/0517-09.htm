<p>WASHINGTON  - May 17 - The American Civil Liberties Union today urged lawmakers not to 
be appeased by the White House's decision on Tuesday to finally provide both the 
House and Senate intelligence committees, as required by law, with classified 
briefings on the warrantless wiretapping and data-mining of Americans conducted 
by the National Security Agency (NSA), saying the move was only a first step 
toward restoring meaningful checks and balances.
<P>The following can be attributed to Caroline Fredrickson, Director of the ACLU 
Washington Legislative Office:</P>
<P>"The White House's recognition of Congress's right and responsibility to 
conduct oversight on the NSA is a belated sign that the administration at least 
nominally acknowledges that our Constitution requires a system of checks and 
balances. The administration must now show that its shift is not just political 
appeasement to ease General Michael Hayden&#8217;s confirmation as the new director of 
the Central Intelligence Agency, but a genuine recognition of congressional 
authority. Lawmakers must be given full access to the facts and responsive 
answers from the administration regarding the NSA&#8217;s monitoring of Americans&#8217; 
communications without court orders.</P>
<P>"Both the Constitution and federal laws give Congress oversight 
responsibility over the actions of the administration to help secure our civil 
liberties, including Americans&#8217; fundamental right to privacy. It&#8217;s regrettable 
the administration refused for five months to brief all members of the 
intelligence committees, and this latest shift in the administration&#8217;s stance 
must be the beginning, not the end, of the oversight process. Closed-door 
briefings should not be used to thwart the members of the Senate Select 
Committee on Intelligence from asking tough public questions of General Hayden, 
and he should provide the American public with answers. Our nation must be 
guided by the rule of law -- we will continue to fight for the truth to be 
brought to light."</P><!-- #EndEditable -->
