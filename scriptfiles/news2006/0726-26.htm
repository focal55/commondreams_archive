<p>WASHINGTON - July 26 -  



Congressman Dennis J. Kucinich (D-OH) gave the following floor speech today on legislation he is introducing to abolish all nuclear weapons:

<p>"In the Hindu religion Brahma, the creator, Vishnu, the preserver, and Siva, the destroyer, exist simultaneously and represent the multiplicity of God. Today, we are going to be called upon to determine which of the principles - creator, preserver or destroyer - shall work through each of us. 

<p>"If we continue to pursue nuclear proliferation embodied in the nuclear agreement with India we will be open to the principals of destruction. At this moment when world tensions are rising and violence is cycling wider, we need to take the direction of preserving the peace, and creating a new opening through the abolishment of all nuclear weapons. 

<p>"August 6th, 2006, will mark the 61st anniversary of the bombing of Hiroshima, which obliterated the city and killed about 140,000 people.  Today, 30,000 nuclear weapons remain in the world.  Many nuclear weapons are deployed.  Any use of nuclear weapons would result in unthinkable devastation.  The only way to prevent nuclear destruction is to abolish all nuclear weapons.

<p>"To accomplish this I will be introducing legislation today." 

<p>Today, Kucinich introduced legislation, HR 950, to abolish all nuclear weapons. Kucinich resolution states, "That the House of Representatives calls upon the President to initiate multilateral negotiations for the abolition of nuclear weapons."
