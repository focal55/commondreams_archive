<p>   DEBORAH REGAL — PINCKNEY, MI</p>
<p>   Urgently needs war to end to get son home safely from Iraq</p>

<p>   Deborah Regal’s son serves in the United States Marine Corps; he is currently serving his first tour of duty in Iraq. Deb Regal understand that while her son is fighting in Iraq, she is fighting to end the war there. “He understands what he does and he understands what I do,” said Regal, a long-time member of Military Families Speak Out and a Pinckney schoolteacher. “He takes the oath that he was asked to sign very seriously. He views dissent within a democracy as essential.”</p>
<p>   She continues, “I acknowledge the personal sacrifices, training and dedication of our volunteer armed forces. It is precisely because I have this awareness, heightened from the perspective of a mother of one of those brave and skilled military personnel, that I say ‘NO’ to a war that is staged in defiance of international law and consensus… .”</p>
<p>   Deb joined Military Families Speak Out on January 19, 2003 — exactly two months before the U.S. invasion of Iraq began. &quot;We have to make it clear,” Deb said in March of 2003, “(that) we do not oppose our people in uniform, but the agenda of this administration. You can be an advocate for peace and a sincere supporter of our troops.”  More than three years later, she is speaking out to bring her son and all of our troops home now, and take care of them when they get here.</p>

<p>   ANNE ROESLER — SARATOGA, CA</p>
<p>   Dissent is patriotic</p>

<p>   For Anne Roesler, the war is a source of continuing anxiety and threat.  Her son, a staff sergeant in the Army’s 82nd Airborne Division, recently returned from his third tour of duty in Iraq, and there is no guarantee that he won’t be redeployed for a fourth time.  He has spent more than 550 days there since the invasion, and she says that, in the last 3 years, she has “watched him turn from a sensitive young man, who wore his heart on his sleeve and was in awe of being ‘in the cradle of civilization’ in Iraq, into someone who is filled with anxiety and so much anger that he can barely speak.”</p>
<p>   Anne questioned the war prior to the invasion and knowing that her son was somewhere in the Middle East the night the bombing of Baghdad began provided the impetus for speaking out against it.  When asked how her son feels about her speaking out, she replies, “My son tells me that he and other enlisted personnel give up some of their rights when they join the military, in order to protect ours.  Since he cannot speak freely, he encourages me to do so.  What better way can I honor my son and all those who’ve served and died than to exercise my Constitutional rights?”     Anne, a long-time member of Military Families Speak Out, says that she will continue to advocate for an immediate end to the war, for all the troops to be withdrawn now, and for them to receive the care and support they need to reintegrate successfully into their families and communities.</p>

<p>   KAREN MEREDITH – MOUNTAIN VIEW, CA </p>
<p>   FOUNDER OF GOLD STAR FAMILIES SPEAK OUT </p>
<p>    “If I don’t speak, how will people know what it feels like to be a Gold Star mother?”</p>

<p>   On Karen Meredith’s left ankle is a tattoo of a heart surrounded by a gold star.  Though the tattoo looks bright and cheerful, it is in fact a somber reminder of tragic loss.  In May 2004, Meredith’s only child - Lt. Ken Ballard - was killed in Iraq at the young age of 26.  At that moment, her life as a Gold Star mother began.  Her decision to become actively involved in antiwar efforts came a short time later, at Ken’s funeral at Arlington Cemetery.  “I looked down at his grave,” recalls Meredith, “and I said, ‘If I don’t speak, how will people know what it feels like to be a Gold Star mother, to walk this path?’”  </p>
<p>   Founder of Gold Star Families Speak Out, Meredith has been actively involved with the American Friends Service Committee’s Eyes Wide Open: The Human Cost of War living memorial.  She has been a featured speaker at numerous peace events throughout the country.   Last September, she was in Crawford, Texas, for the Bring Them Home Now Tour that traveled the country before arriving in Washington, D.C. for United for Peace and Justice’s End the War on Iraq mobilization. In March 2006, California’s 22nd Assembly District named Meredith “Woman of the Year” for her tireless efforts as a peace activist to end the war and bring American troops home.  </p>
<p>   Initially, the U.S. military told Meredith that her son had been killed in action.  However, after a fifteen-month battle with Army officials, Meredith discovered that Ken had in fact died as a result of wounds from the accidental discharge of a machine gun on his tank.  “I was stunned and appalled that the Army took 15 months to tell me the truth,” she later remarked.  </p>
