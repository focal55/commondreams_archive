<p>WASHINGTON - September 12 - Congressman Dennis J. Kucinich (D-OH) issued the following statement today on the President’s address to the nation on the fifth anniversary of 9/11</p>
<p>“On a day when the nation came together in shared grief and resolve, the President used his primetime address to the nation to once again exploit the tragic events of 9/11 for political purposes and to continue his campaign to intentionally mislead the nation by conflating Iraq with 9/11.</p>
<p>“At a time when the President should have been unifying the country, the President shamelessly used his bully pulpit to deliver a partisan, divisive and flat out misleading speech.</p>
<p>“Iraq had nothing to do with the attacks on this nation on 9/11. Iraq had nothing to do with al-Qeada before 9/11 and, despite the President’s assertion last night, Iraq was not a threat to our nation. The President’s war of choice in Iraq has been a grave mistake and a tremendous distraction from the real effort to root out worldwide terrorism</p>
<p>“Iraq is mired in a deadly civil war with US troops, and innocent Iraqis, caught in the crosshairs. The civil war in Iraq cannot and will not be won by the Administration’s military occupation of Iraq. We must immediately end the occupation of Iraq and bring our troops home with the honor and dignity they deserve</p>
<p>“The Administration’s so-called ‘War on Terror’ is a War of Errors.</p>
<p>“From Iraq to Afghanistan, from illegal domestic spying to snooping into people's banking records, from North Korea to Iran, from Gitmo to Abu Ghraib at every turn this Administration has failed the American people, made our nation less safe, and has operated with contempt for the Constitution, dismissing the most basic principles of our democracy</p>
<p>“On the fifth anniversary of 9/11, the President’s speech last night highlighted the partisan and divisive tone that the Administration’s has taken since that tragic day. Instead of creating a nation that comes together for our greater aspirations, the Administration has created a nation divided against itself. The President’s speech last night did our nation a great disservice.”</p>
