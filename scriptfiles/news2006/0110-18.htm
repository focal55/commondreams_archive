<p>WASHINGTON - January 10 - Nancy Keenan, president of NARAL Pro-Choice America, issued the following statement after the first round of questioning of Supreme Court nominee Samuel Alito by Sen. Arlen Specter (R-Pa.).</p>
<p>   "Under the first round of questions from Senator Specter, Samuel Alito did not refute his record of opposition to Roe v. Wade. He did not state whether he believes that the right to privacy includes a woman's right to choose. He did acknowledge that his 1985 statement, which said he believes legally that the Constitution does not protect a right to an abortion, was accurate. At this early stage in the hearings, Alito is stealing a page from Clarence Thomas' playbook. Thomas said the constitution included a right to privacy, then he voted to overturn Roe v. Wade one year later.  Thus far, Alito has failed to give the American public any assurances that he would protect a woman's right to choose."
