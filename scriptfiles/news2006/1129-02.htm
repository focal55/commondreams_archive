<p>WASHINGTON - November 29 - International aid  agency Oxfam welcomed Tuesday's meeting between Starbucks CEO Jim  Donald and Prime Minister Meles Zenawi, but urged the  international coffee giant to stop dragging its feet before the  holidays, and instead recognize Ethiopia's ownership of its  coffee names and the enormous benefits that ownership could bring  to the 15 million poor Ethiopians who depend on coffee for their  livelihood.</p>
<p>   &quot;It's significant that after a year of trying to engage  Starbucks on trademarks, the company finally sat down to discuss  the issue directly with Ethiopia,&quot; said Seth Petchers, Oxfam  International's Make Trade Fair campaign coffee lead. &quot;Starbucks  must now follow up with immediate action to recognize Ethiopia's  rights to own the names of its coffees to ensure that coffee  farmers get a fairer share of the value of their crop.&quot;</p>
<p>   Ethiopia's farmers produce some of the finest and most sought  after coffees in the world-including coffees that have been sold  under Starbucks' Black Apron Exclusives line for up to $26 a  pound-but receive only 5 to 10 percent of the retail price, in a  country where millions live on just a dollar a day. Ethiopia is  working to gain greater benefits for its coffee growers by  seeking control of its coffee names, a move that would give  Ethiopian coffee farmers a fairer share of the profits in the  global coffee trade.</p>
<p>   &quot;Small-scale coffee farmers are economically vulnerable, in  part because large foreign buyers, such as Starbucks, are  dictating trading conditions with their extraordinary market  power,&quot; continued Petchers. &quot;If poor countries are able to obtain  trademarks for unique, locally grown products like coffee, they  can capture more of the value of their products for the benefit  of the people who produce them. This initiative is a significant  and innovative approach to alleviating poverty.&quot;</p>
<p>   For over a year, Ethiopia has sought a dialogue with Starbucks  about supporting the country's efforts to return more of the  price of its coffees in world markets to the farmers who produce  them by seeking trademark rights for Sidamo, Harar and  Yirgacheffe coffees. Despite its much-publicized commitment to  farming communities, however, Starbucks has continually rejected  Ethiopia's requests to resolve the trademark issue.  Absent that  step, no agreement was reached at Tuesday's meeting.</p>
<p>   &quot;This is a rights issue and we deserve to have our rights  recognized. We strongly believe that trademarking is the way to  go,&quot; said Prime Minister Meles Zenawi. &quot;The right to own our  coffee names is the only way that we can preserve our rich coffee  heritage; Ethiopia has an obligation to coffee consumers  worldwide to protect and preserve our unique coffees.&quot;</p>
<p>   Legal and intellectual property experts have supported  Ethiopia in its approach, expressing the opinion that the  trademark and licensing project is a viable solution to the  poverty that plagues Ethiopian farmers. Trademark rights for  Ethiopia's coffees have also been recognized in several European  countries, as well as Canada and Japan.</p>
<p>   &quot;Our coffees are some of the best in the world and although  they often sell for two and three times the cost of other  coffees, we are getting a tiny fraction of this price,&quot; said  Tadesse Meskela, manager of Oromia Coffee Farmers Cooperative  Union who is featured in the new documentary Black Gold. &quot;Our  objective here is to return more money to the coffee growers'  pocket.&quot;</p>
<p>   Last month, Oxfam launched an international public campaign to  encourage Starbucks to engage with Ethiopia directly on the  issue.</p>
<p>   &quot;Over 85,000 people around the world have joined Oxfam in  calling on Starbucks to do right by Ethiopia's coffee farmers and  sign the licensing agreement,&quot; continued Petchers. &quot;Oxfam and its  supporters will continue to work with the Ethiopian government,  coffee growers, and exporters to encourage Starbucks to come to a  mutually beneficial solution that could make a world of  difference for millions of poor people.&quot;</p>
