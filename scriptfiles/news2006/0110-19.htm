<p>WASHINGTON - January 10 - Following is a  statement by Paul Blank, campaign director for WakeUpWalMart.com  on Wal-Mart's recent statement regarding its wage and job data: </p>
<p>   "Wal-Mart is a company speaking out of both sides of its  mouth.  Recently, Wal-Mart pledged to Wall Street it would reduce  labor costs and an internal memo, authored by senior management,  confirmed their intention to shift to more part-time employees.   Now, Wal-Mart's spin machine thinks we will just believe their  average hourly wage has increased. Wal-Mart's figures are  questionable at best and are more likely attributable to a  reduction in the number or redefinition of full-time associates  than a desire to do the right thing.  Wal-Mart should release its  full wage and benefits data for public review so that it can be  thoroughly analyzed and verified.  Real working families in  America understand Wal-Mart's business practices drive down  wages, lower benefits, and ship U.S. jobs overseas."</p>
<p>   In response, WakeUpWalMart.com released the "Top 10 Questions"  Wal-Mart needs to answer to uncover the truth behind these  figures.</p>
<p>   1) If you actually created 125,000 jobs, why has the total  number of employees in the general merchandise industry actually  fallen by 1,000 employees from 2001 to 2004, from 2,628,000 to  2,627,000? (Bureau of Labor Statistics)</p>
<p>   2) If Wal-Mart seeks to create jobs in the U.S., why does it  force its suppliers, or directly contract, to ship American jobs  overseas? (FAST Company, January 2006, Frontline, 11/16/2004, Los  Angeles Times, 11/24/2003, A.1, The Associated Press, 8/3/2004  and AFX International Focus, 6/30/2005)</p>
<p>   3) If Wal-Mart supposedly cares about working families in  America, why won't Wal-Mart adopt a 'Buy American' program that  would help protect our jobs?  Why does Wal-Mart promote policies  that destroy good-paying middle class manufacturing jobs and  replace them with low-paying Wal-Mart jobs? ( NAM Council of  Manufacturing Associations "Securing America's Future: The Case  for A Strong Manufacturing Base." 6/2003; Bureau of Economic  Analysis. <a href="http://releases.usnewswire.com/redir.asp?ReleaseID=59094&Link=http://www.nam.org/s_nam/sec.asp?CID=201720&DID=230272">http://www.nam.org/s_nam/sec.asp?CID=201720&DID=230272</a> ) </p>
<p>   4) How does Wal-Mart explain a 5 percent decline in the  average real wage for retail workers - a decline of $15,883 to  $15,140 from 1982-2002?  Does management still stand by its  statement that Wal-Mart jobs are not intended to support a  family? (Bureau of Labor Statistics)</p>
<p>   5) Does Wal-Mart's figure of $10.11 for average hourly wages  include store management, executive management, directors or CEO  Lee Scott's $23 million in compensation?  What is the average  hourly wage for management or 'non-store associates' for  comparison? (Wal-Mart Press Release, 1/10/06, Wal-Mart SEC Filing  Schedule 14A, 2005) </p>
<p>   6) What is the average hourly wage for part-time workers and  average number of hours?  Isn't most of the rise in the average  hourly wage for full-time associates attributable to your desire,  as documented in your internal memo, to increase the number of  part-time associates? (Executive Vice President Susan Chambers,  Wal-Mart Internal Memo, 2005)</p>
<p>   7) How much does Wal-Mart spend on wages total in the U.S and  what is the total number of hours broken out by average number of  hours worked per worker?  </p>
<p>   8) Did the percentage of full-time associates actually decline  at Wal-Mart during 2005? Will Wal-Mart release the percentage of  full-time workers (and definition of full-time), as you did for  2004, so that we can accurately compare whether the average  hourly wage actually increased or the percentage of full-time  associates just decreased? (www.walmartfacts.com)</p>
<p>   9) How does Wal-Mart reconcile contradictory statements by its  investor relations team to Wall Street stating it is utilizing  new software to reduce labor costs (which have led to problems in  the stores with workers being forced to quit) with statements by  its public relations team stating it is supposedly increasing the  average wage? (South Florida Herald Tribune, 8/9/05, Wal-Mart  Twelfth Annual Analysts' Meeting Day 1 - Final FD (Fair  Disclosure) Wire October 25, 2005 Tuesday )</p>
<p>   10) How does Wal-Mart explain why the only available  information detailing Wal-Mart's wage data by job function and  classification, made available through discovery in a lawsuit,  shows hourly wages far below these figures? ("Statistical  Analysis of Gender Patterns in Wal-Mart's Workforce", Dr. Richard  Drogin 2003.</p>
