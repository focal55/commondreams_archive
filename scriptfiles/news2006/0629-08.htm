<p>WASHINGTON - June 29 
<p><b><a href="mailto:bjo@ccr-ny.org">BARBARA OLSHANSKY</a></b><br>
Olshansky is director counsel of the Guantanamo Global Justice 
Initiative at the Center for Constitutional Rights, which has been 
representing several of the Guantanamo detainees including Jumah Al 
Dossari, who has repeatedly attempted suicide. She said today: "This is 
a major victory for our democratic institutions and for our 
organization. The Supreme Court is saying that the president can't go 
and create some new legal universe where he makes the rules -- there's 
due process. He must allow trials or release the detainees. This is an 
astounding blow to the notion of a unitary executive."

<p><b><a href="mailto:lrubenstein@phrusa.org">LEONARD RUBENSTEIN</a></b><br>
Rubenstein is executive director of Physicians for Human Rights, 
which has closely tracked developments at Guantanamo. He said today: 
"The Supreme Court has rejected the legitimacy of the president's 
authority outside any kind of legal framework. This could be a real 
milestone in the restoration of legal process." Rubenstein is an attorney.

Berrigan is with Witness Against Torture: A Campaign to Shut Down 
Guantanamo. On Monday, which was the UN International Day in Support of 
Torture Victims and Survivors, she and 60 other activists -- including 
rabbis, priests and nuns -- attempted to confront UN ambassador John 
Bolton at the U.S. Mission to the UN about U.S. torture policies.
In December, Berrigan and 23 other activists, many affiliated with 
the Catholic Worker movement, marched 100 miles in Cuba in an attempt to 
visit the prisoners in Guantanamo.
