<p>WASHINGTON - January 3 - Lobbyist Jack Abramoff's guilty plea to corruption, fraud and tax evasion charges should bring important changes to the lobbying industry, according to Roberta Baskin, executive director of the Center for Public Integrity.
</p><p>
"It took the Watergate scandal to create our nation's campaign finance laws and the FEC (<a href="/lobby/profile.aspx?act=agencies&ag=055">Federal Election Commission</a>). Maybe the <a href="/lobby/search.aspx?act=indiv&year=2003&term=Jack+Abramoff">Abramoff</a> scandal will lead to more transparency in the lobbying industry," Baskin said.
</p><p>
Abramoff pleaded guilty today in U.S. District Court in Washington D.C. to three felony charges, an agreement with federal prosecutors that could clear the way for Abramoff to testify against former colleagues and members of Congress as part of an ongoing federal corruption investigation.
</p><p>
"A scandal like this can have huge repercussions. This could lead to a new day on K Street," <a href="/lobby/default.aspx?act=exec">Baskin said</a>.
</p><p>
The Center for Public Integrity, a non-profit, non-partisan watchdog group, has been tracking the lobbying industry for a decade. In June, 2005, the Center launched <a href="/lobby">LobbyWatch</a>, an ongoing series of stories and a frequently updated database about lobbying on all political levels. The project - which lists lobbyists, lobbying firms, the amount they spend and on whom - is a rich resource for journalists, policy makers and the public.
</p><p>
Baskin cited information that can be found in the Center's <a href="/lobby">LobbyWatch</a> project:
</p>

<ul>
<strong>Abramoff Lobbying:</strong>
<li>The Center found that the lobbying firms <a href="/lobby/profile.aspx?act=firms&year=2003&lo=L001798">Greenberg, Traurig, LLP</a> and <a href="/lobby/profile.aspx?act=firms&year=2003&lo=L002536">Preston Gates Ellis Rouvelas & Meeds LLP</a> collectively represented 300 companies and organizations during the years Abramoff worked for them. The firms billed close to $100 million during that time.</li>
</ul>


<ul>
<strong>Campaign Finance:</strong>
<li>The Center found that Abramoff was one of 52 registered lobbyists who were major fundraisers for George W. Bush's presidential campaigns. Abramoff raised $100,000 for Bush's 2004 campaign as a Pioneer and lobbied on issues brought before the White House for 19 clients.</li>
<li>More than 1,300 registered lobbyists have personally given more than $1.8 million to President Bush over the last six years; while Senator John Kerry received $520,000 from 442 lobbyists during the same period.</li>
<li>In addition, federally registered lobbyists have served as the treasurers of at least 868 political committees since 1998. These committees  have spent more than $525 million to influence the political process.</li>
<li>At least 79 members of Congress have appointed lobbyists to head their campaign committees or leadership PACs since 1998.</li>
</ul>


<ul>
<strong>Revolving Doors:</strong>
<li>Abramoff was known to hire well-connected lobbyists with previous government positions, often defined as "revolving doors." His two firms, Greenberg, Traurig, LLP and Preston Gates Ellis Rouvelas & Meeds LLP  have employed more than 70 lobbyists who have had previous government positions.</li>
<li>A <a href="/lobby/report.aspx?aid=678">Center study</a> found more than 2,200 former federal government employees registered as federal lobbyists between 1998 and 2004.</li>
<li>Since 1998, 273 former White House staffers registered as lobbyists.</li>
<li>Nearly 250 former members of Congress and agency heads have registered as lobbyists since 1998.</li>
</ul>


<ul>
<strong>Compliance:</strong>
<li>Currently, the Senate has less than a dozen people who have to keep track of a $2 billion a year industry.</li>
<li>A <a href="/lobby/report.aspx?aid=676">Center study</a> found nearly 14,000 documents that should have been filed periodically with the Senate Office of Public Records are missing.</li>
<li>Similarly, <a href="/lobby/report.aspx?aid=676">49 of the top 50</a> lobbying firms failed to file required forms</li>
</ul>
