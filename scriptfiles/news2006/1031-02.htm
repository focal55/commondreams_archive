<p>PHILADELPHIA - October 31 - Fifty-seven year  White House senior correspondent, Helen Thomas addresses the  American Friends Service Committee (AFSC) Annual Public Gathering  on the media's role as watchdogs of democracy.</p>
<p>   The AFSC Annual Public Gathering is noted for concentrating  attention on social justice issues within a spiritual framework  and will be held Nov. 4, at the historic Friends Meetinghouse at  Fourth and Arch Streets in Philadelphia. (See <a href="http://releases.usnewswire.com/redir.asp?ReleaseID=75350&Link=http://www.afsc.org">http://www.afsc.org</a>  for details).</p>
<p>   &quot;I can think of no better person than Helen Thomas for this  event,&quot; said Mary Ellen McNish, general secretary (chief  executive) for AFSC, an international social justice organization  and a co-recipient of the 1947 Nobel Peace Prize. &quot;Thomas is an  outspoken advocate for Middle East peace and the Service  Committee has been working for reconciliation in the region since  1949, when, at the United Nations' request, AFSC provided relief  to thousands of Palestinian refugees after the Arab-Israel War.&quot;</p>
<p>   Thomas is expected to speak on her new book entitled,  “Watchdogs of Democracy?: The Waning Washington Press Corps and  How It Has Failed the Public,” which laments a press core  monopolized by big business. </p>
<p>   Widely recognized as a pioneer in women's journalism, Thomas  has covered every president since John F. Kennedy. As UPI White  House senior correspondent, she was accorded the customary  closing, &quot;Thank you, Mr. President.&quot;  She is now a syndicated  columnist for Hearst News Service. </p>
<p>   Best known for launching massive programs to feed millions of  starving children in post-war Germany, the American Friends  Service Committee is a Quaker organization respecting the dignity  and worth of every person. The search for regional peace has been  a major focus of the AFSCs highly regarded international affairs  work.  </p>
<p>   &quot;Philadelphia has been a center of activity for Quakers  internationally and this event focuses our global quest for peace  and social justice,&quot; McNish explains.</p>
<p>   The Annual Public Gathering begins at 1:30 p.m. It is free and  open to the public. For information, call 215-241-7000, or visit  <a href="http://releases.usnewswire.com/redir.asp?ReleaseID=75350&Link=http://www.afsc.org">http://www.afsc.org</a>. </p>
<p>   Note to Editors: Thomas, McNish are available for interview.  Head shots, photos of arch street meeting are available. Coverage  invited.</p>
