<p>WASHINGTON - April 6 - <p>WHAT: Press conference and release of new report, "Fake TV News:  
Widespread and Undisclosed"

<p>WHEN: Thursday, April 6, 10 a.m.

<p>WHERE: CWA Building, 501 3rd St. NW, Washington, DC, First Floor

<p>WHO:

Hon. Jonathan S. Adelstein, Federal Communications Commission Diane Farsetta, senior researcher, Center for Media and Democracy John Stauber, executive director, Center for Media and Democracy Timothy Karr, campaign director, Free Press Ben Scott, policy director, Free Press

<p>DETAILS:

<p>Thursday morning's press conference will present the results of a 10- 
month investigation by the Center for Media and Democracy (CMD) into  
the current epidemic of "video news releases," or VNRs, being  
presented as real news stories on local television stations across  
the country. The report -- "Fake TV News: Widespread and Undisclosed"  
-- will offer the most detailed picture available to date of TV  
newsrooms' use of sponsored broadcast material.

<p>Despite repeated assurances from broadcasters that they do not air  
VNRs as news, investigators from CMD have caught stations extensively  
passing off corporate-sponsored content as their own reporting. The  
press conference will unveil a multimedia Web site showing both VNRs  
and their broadcast as "news" by TV stations and networks, including  
those in the nation's biggest markets.

<p>At the conference, Free Press and CMD will announce the launch their  
"No Fake News" campaign, calling on the FCC to crack down on  
broadcasters violating the public trust by airing video news releases  
without revealing their sponsors.
