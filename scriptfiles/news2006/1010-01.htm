<p>WASHINGTON - October 10 - <p>   WHO: Tadesse Meskela, star of the documentary, &quot;Black Gold,&quot;  and manager of Oromia Coffee Farmers Cooperative Union in  Ethiopia</p>
<p>   Oromia Coffee Farmers Cooperative Union has been an Oxfam  America partner since 2002. The Union represents nearly 70,000  Ethiopian coffee farmers and works to alleviate the poverty and  injustice they face. Oxfam America is an international relief and  development organization that works to end poverty, hunger and  injustice.</p>
<p>   WHAT: Tadesse Meskela will join moviegoers and Oxfam staff for  question and answer sessions immediately following the 7 p.m. and  9:10 p.m. showings of &quot;Black Gold&quot; on Thursday, Oct. 12 and the  9:10 p.m. showing on Friday, Oct. 13.</p>
<p>   Tadesse Meskela will be available for one on one interviews  with the media.</p>
<p>   &quot;Black Gold&quot; is an eye-opening and entertaining exploration of  the business of coffee -- from handpicked bean to the $3 cup. The  documentary reveals the great disparity between impoverished  Ethiopian coffee farmers and the thriving western markets that  profit from their labor and tells the story of one man committed  to narrowing the gap. &quot;Black Gold&quot; premiered at the Sundance Film  Festival and will be expanding to theaters nationwide over the  next six weeks. </p>
<p>   WHEN: Oct. 12, 7 p.m. and 9:10 p.m. &quot;Black Gold&quot; showings,  Oct. 13, 9:10 p.m. &quot;Black Gold&quot; showing</p>
<p>   Question and answer sessions are immediately following movie  showings</p>
<p>   WHERE: Cinema Village Theater, 22 E 12th St., New York, NY</p>
<p>   WHY: Take advantage of this unique opportunity to get to the  bottom of what goes in to a cup of coffee -- and hear it first  hand from Tadesse Meskela.</p>
