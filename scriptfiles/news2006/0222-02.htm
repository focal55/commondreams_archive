<p>WASHINGTON - February 22 - As the World Bank Executive Board 
prepared to meet on Thursday to implement 
promises made by world leaders last summer on 
impoverished country debt cancellation, Jubilee 
USA Network today called on the Bank's Board to 
vote down a proposal that would delay debt relief 
for more than half of the countries eligible for at least 2 years.

<p>"Last summer, President Bush and other world 
leaders promised debt cancellation to the world's 
most impoverished countries. But a proposal 
before the World Bank this week would needlessly 
delay cancellation for at least two years from 
last year's G-8 summit for more than half of 
those countries eligible," said Neil Watkins, 
National Coordinator for Jubilee USA Network. "To 
top it off, the Bank is asking these countries to 
keep making non-refundable debt payments to the 
Bank instead of using the funds to fight poverty, 
HIV/AIDS, and now avian flu in Africa. We call on 
the US Executive Director and the World Bank's 
Board to do the right thing and scrap these 
delays when they meet on Thursday."

<p>World Bank President Paul Wolfowitz has recently 
claimed that all eligible countries are well on 
their way to receiving cancellation. On February 
11, Wolfowitz said, "The path to complete debt 
relief now has been cleared. Across Africa and 
around the World, leaders in 42 countries will no 
longer have to choose between spending to benefit 
their people and repaying impossible debts, often 
the legacy of governments past." But in the 
proposal before the Bank on Thursday, fewer than 
half of these 42 countries would even be eligible 
to see debt cancellation before mid-2007. Most of 
these countries face even longer delays as they 
must implement economic policy reforms in order 
to qualify - many of which, like water privatization, hurt the poorest.

<p>The World Bank Executive Board will meet tomorrow 
and again in mid- March to put the finishing 
touches on debt cancellation for those 
impoverished countries made eligible under the 
terms of the July 2005 G-8 debt agreement, now 
called the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative 
(MDRI). This follows the IMF Board's approval of 
debt cancellation for 19 impoverished countries this past December.

<p>For Jubilee USA Network, there are three key 
issues of concern that the World Bank must address:
<p>  
<ul>
<li>The Bank is proposing what amounts to a 
15-month delay for any additional countries to 
receive cancellation beyond an initial 17 
nations. This new approach will mean that 
countries that already qualify for the debt 
relief program - such as Burundi, Guinea, Malawi, 
and Sierra Leone, many of which heavily burdened 
by HIV/AIDS - will now have to wait until July 
2007 at the earliest for debt cancellation - a 
full two years after the G-8 summit was held in 
Gleneagles. Particularly outrageous is the fact 
that countries will have to continue to make 
non-refundable payments on their debts even after they reach completion point.<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>While IMF debt cancellation provided 
cancellation of all debts through end-2004, the 
World Bank proposal would only cover debts until 
end-2003. For nations like Burundi and Malawi, 
combined with the delays they face, this will 
mean even after "100% debt cancellation" to the 
World Bank, they will owe millions in debts to the World Bank from 2004-2007. <br>
<br>
</li>
<li>Far too few countries get debt cancellation 
under the current program. In April, the World 
Bank proposes to add 4 new countries to the HIPC 
Initiative - Haiti, Eritrea, Kyrgyz Republic, and 
Nepal. But these nations - including Haiti - the 
Western Hemisphere's poorest nation - will face 
interminable delays and in the case of Haiti will 
not see actual debt cancellation until December 
2009 because of the economic conditions attached 
to qualification for debt relief and full debt 
cancellation. Moreover, the fact that the World 
Bank proposes to add only 4 nations again 
demonstrates the utter inadequacy of the HIPC 
framework. The UK government and leading 
international charities have identified at least 
60-70 countries that would need 100% debt 
cancellation to meet the Millennium Development 
Goals and many more nations require cancellation 
of odious and illegitimate debts. The HIPC approach is clearly inadequate. Jubilee USA Network is the US arm of the 
international movement working for debt 
cancellation for impoverished nations. Jubilee 
USA is a network of over 75 religious 
denominations and faith-based groups, labor 
groups, environmental organizations, and 
community and advocacy groups working for freedom 
from debt and economic justice for countries in 
Africa, Asia, and Latin America.</li>
