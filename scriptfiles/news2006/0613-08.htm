<p>WASHINGTON - June 13 - 
                            John Brittain, Chief Counsel and 
                            Deputy Director of the Lawyers' Committee for Civil 
                            Rights Under Law, (&#147;Lawyers' Committee&#148;) 
                            will testify today before the House Committee on Education 
                            and the Workforce to discuss, &quot;No Child Left 
                            Behind: Disaggregating Student Achievement by Subgroups 
                            to Ensure All Students Are Learning.&quot; In his 
                            testimony, Brittain will argue that disaggregating 
                            student achievement data into race, income, and other 
                            important categories is necessary because it reveals 
                            our nation's wide and unacceptable achievement gaps.<br>
                            <br>
                            The Lawyers' Committee is concerned that the No Child 
                            Left Behind Act has been interpreted to mean, &#147;No 
                            State Wants to Look Bad,&#148; in terms of annual 
                            yearly progress. When states are given a choice between 
                            improving the quality of education and lowering the 
                            bar to satisfy state goals on standardized tests, 
                            state education authorities have opted, &#147;to lower 
                            the bar or omit data to look good because this choice 
                            offers less resistance than improving the product 
                            of education in schools,&#148; noted Brittain. <br>
                            <br>
                            It is estimated that nearly 2 million students across 
                            the nation have scores that went uncounted. Under 
                            the No Child Left Behind Act, states have the discretion 
                            to leave out scores of students if the subgroup is 
                            statistically small or &#147;game the system.&#148; 
                            Brittain suggests that Congress should close this 
                            loophole so that these two million scores are not 
                            lost. &#147;Predominantly, it is the African American, 
                            Latino, and Native American students that are truly 
                            being left behind,&#148; added Brittain. <br>
                            <br>
                            To ensure that all students are learning under the 
                            No Child Left Behind Act, Brittain will urge the House 
                            Committee on Education and the Workforce to disaggregate 
                            student achievement statistics.
