<p>WASHINGTON - July 26 - 

<p><a href="mailto:quigley.2@osu.edu"><b>JOHN QUIGLEY</b></a>, 
<a href="http://moritzlaw.osu.edu/jfc/staff/quigley.html" target="_new">http://moritzlaw.osu.edu/jfc/staff/quigley.html</a><br>
Professor of law at Ohio State University, Quigley is author of 
numerous books on international law including "Genocide Convention" and 
"Palestine and Israel: A Challenge to Justice."
<p>He said today: "Yesterday's bombing of the UN compound has striking 
parallels with the shelling in April 1996 by Israel of the UN compound 
at Qana, Lebanon, when:
1. IDF [Israel Defense Forces] knew that this was a UN compound, because 
it was a long-established UN compound.
2. IDF knew at the time of firing that it was a UN compound and 
inhabited, because IDF had a drone overhead sending real-time pictures 
back to the gunners.
3. Shelling went on for a period of time, during which UN officials made 
desperate phone calls to IDF positions telling them they were killing 
civilians and asking them to stop.
4. UN complained (General Assembly passed a resolution of condemnation 
of Israel), but Israel made no serious investigation and wrote it off as 
a tragic mistake."
    Quigley was involved in filing a complaint over the shelling of Qana 
to the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child.

<p><b><a href="mailto:uswarreport@igc.org">IAN WILLIAMS</a></b>, <a href="http://deadlinepundit.blogspot.com" target="_new">http://deadlinepundit.blogspot.com</a><br>

    Author of the book "The U.N. For Beginners," Williams covers the UN. 
He said today: "Already Kofi Annan is under attack for condemning the 
'apparently deliberate targeting by Israeli Defense Forces of a UN 
Observer post.'
    <p>"It is reminiscent of the trouble his predecessor Boutros 
Boutros-Ghali got himself into last time the Israelis tried shock and 
awe on Lebanon back in 1996, when he failed to suppress a report that 
said pretty much the same thing about the IDF shelling of the UN post in 
Qana, which macerated some 106 Lebanese civilians to death. ...
    <p>"It is clear that there are many in the IDF with a profound contempt 
for the UN and all it stands for, and who would not shed many tears at 
such an accident. It may also rankle that UNIFIL has, with the dearth of 
Western reporters in much of South Lebanon, provided independent 
corroboration of many incidents of IDF attacks on civilians. ...
   <p> "And most sinisterly of all, there are many Israelis -- including 
the government only a few days ago -- who do not want an international 
force between them and their targets in Lebanon, who would have no great 
scruples about bombing a UN compound 'accidentally on purpose.'"
