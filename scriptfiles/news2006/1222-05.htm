<p>WASHINGTON - December 22 - The Humane Society of the United States (HSUS) released the results of a mass spectrometry test
today conducted on a Sean John Hooded Snorkel Jacket sold on Macys.com that
was originally advertised as having an "imitation rabbit fur collar" and
materials identified as "faux fur."
The jacket, part of a clothing line by Sean "Diddy" Combs, was labeled
as containing "raccoon" fur, but has now been found to be fur from a canine
species known as "raccoon dog." Macy's informed The HSUS that the company
has pulled the mislabeled Sean John garments from its department stores and
online shop. The group is urging all retailers to follow the lead of
Macy's.
<p>"First these jackets were falsely advertised as faux fur, and then it
turned out that the fur came from a type of dog," said Wayne Pacelle,
president and CEO of The HSUS. "This is an industry-wide problem, and our
investigation demonstrates that retailers and designers aren't paying close
enough attention to composition of the fur trim they are selling. It's
especially problematic when the fur is sourced from China where domestic
dogs and cats and raccoon dogs are killed in gruesome ways, even skinned
alive. The safest course of action is for Sean Combs and other designers
and retailers to stop using fur trim. That single act would solve the
problems we have uncovered."
<p>The news comes on the heels of other mass spectrometry tests conducted
by The HSUS on a range of fur-trimmed jackets -- from retailers such as
Burlington Coat Factory, Bloomingdale's, J.C. Penney, Macy's, and Saks
Fifth Avenue, and from designers and clothing lines such as Baby Phat,
Andrew Marc, MaxMara, and Calvin Klein -- revealing that most of the
jackets labeled as "raccoon" or "coyote" from China in fact contain fur
from raccoon dogs. Of the ten garments tested by The HSUS, nine tested
positive as raccoon dog fur and were mislabeled, a violation of federal
law.
<p>Due to the lack of animal welfare laws and prevalence of garment
factories, China currently ranks as the leading exporter of fur and
supplies half of all of the fur products that enter the United States for
sale. Animals documented being raised and killed in China -- in barbaric
ways -- include dogs, cats, foxes, mink, and, of particular note, raccoon
dogs, a species of canine whose fur resembles raccoon. An HSUS
investigation in China in 1998 revealed that fur sellers in China will
attach almost any label their customers want on their coats.
<p>The Fur Products Labeling Act prohibits the advertising or sale of any
fur product that is falsely or misleadingly labeled, and authorizes the
Federal Trade Commission to seek criminal penalties, impose fines of up to
$5,000 per violation and to seize mislabeled products.
<p>The HSUS is also calling on Congress to amend the Dog and Cat
Protection Act -- which bans the sale of dog or cat fur in the United
States -- to include raccoon dog, since the animals are so inhumanely
killed and the species is similar to domesticated dogs. Raccoon dogs are
indigenous to Asia, including eastern Siberia and Japan, and are sometimes
called Asiatic raccoons, Finn raccoons, or tanuki. "It would be jarring to
the public to shop in a marketplace where dog and cat fur is banned, but
coats labeled as 'raccoon dog' are still legally sold," added Pacelle.
<p>Each year, over 50 million animals worldwide, such as dogs, cats,
raccoon dogs, mink, foxes, bobcats, beavers, raccoons, and lynx, are killed
for their fur. By supporting fur-free designers, sponsoring fashion design
contests and advertising in industry publications, The HSUS's Fur-Free
Campaign works with both consumers and the fashion industry to encourage
decisions that reject the use of fur and instead promote warm and
fashionable alternatives. To learn about The HSUS's Fur-Free Campaign and
