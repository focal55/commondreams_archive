<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->SAN FRANCISCO / WASHINGTON - May 11 - In response to escalating violence in Iraq and diminishing public support for the war at home, CODEPINK: Women for Peace is taking out full-page ads in major Iraqi newspapers this Mother’s Day weekend. This is the first time ever that US peace activists have reached out to the Iraqi people through the media, and will be a major test of Iraq’s free press. The ads will run as hundreds of women, including actress Susan Sarandon and Gold Star mother Cindy Sheehan, stage a 24-vigil in front of the White House on May 13-14 from 3pm-3pm.

 

<p>“A strong majority of U.S. women want to see an end to war in 2006.  And countless mothers in Iraq have little to celebrate, as their families are torn apart by this violent occupation.  This Mother’s Day, we are reaching out to the Iraqi people, especially the mothers, to show our sorrow for all the bloodshed and our determination to end the occupation of their country,” says Medea Benjamin, cofounder of CODEPINK, the group sponsoring the ads and the vigil. 

 

<p>The full-page ads will be placed in major dailies, including the largest Iraqi newspaper Azzaman (see azzaman.com). The ad call on Americans and Iraqis to work together to stop the bloodshed and bring the US troops home. “We have seen in poll after poll that the majority of Americans and Iraqis want the US troops to return home. Even the majority of US troops (72%) think they should return by the end of this year. It is time for the politicians in both countries to listen to us, the people,” the ad says. The ad is linked to a website, in Arabic, where Iraqis can sign a petition and communicate directly with Americans, either by internet or through the mail. To view the ad and the website, go to <a href="http://www.esteklal.org">www.esteklal.org</a>.

 

<p>The ads are paid for by hundreds of CODEPINK supporters from around the country, including Ann Nelson, wife of renowned singer/songwriter Willie Nelson.  ““I have been heartbroken by all the death and destruction from this war in Iraq, and I am delighted on Mother's Day to have a way to extend my hand in friendship to Iraqi mothers and their families,” says Ms. Nelson, who will also be joining the vigil in Washington DC.

 

<p>The White House vigil will include a concert, film screenings, an aerial photograph, strategy workshops on grassroots organizing and national campaigns, a pajama party, and an interfaith service.  The participants will also write, read and turn in letters to Laura Bush, urging her to pressure her husband to end the war.
