<p>BOSTON - April 7 - Once again, health care advocates and experts are now 
saying, Massachusetts is attempting to extend health coverage to the 
uninsured without in any way addressing the spiraling costs of the 
state's health care system. "This week's proposals merely repeat one 
from 20 years ago when Governor Dukakis was celebrating passage of his 
universal healthcare bill," say Steffie Woolhandler and David 
Himmelstein, Professors of Medicine at Harvard University. "That plan 
imploded within two years, and Massachusetts' new health reform 
legislation looks set to repeat that disaster."

<p>The Bill includes provisions requiring that uninsured families purchase 
at least stripped-down, poor quality health insurance through the 
private market, or face stiff penalties on their tax forms. "This 
mandate throws financially-struggling individuals into battle with 
insurance agents, insurers, and caregivers," say Alan Sager and Deborah 
Socolar, Directors of the Health Reform Program at Boston University's 
School of Public Health. Even these poor, low-premium plans are likely 
to cost low-income families and individuals far more than they can 
afford, and the Bill does not raise enough funds to subsidize even a 
fraction of these new costs. The Bill raises only $170 million per year 
to subsidize the new financial burdens now placed upon the uninsured, 
which is "a drop in the bucket of Massachusetts health care, where 
spending this year will be $59 billion," according to Sager.

<p>Uninsured individuals who are at three times the poverty line, and to 
whom the Bill promises no financial assistance, will be forced to pay 
over 20 percent of their income to cover health care costs, according to 
the best estimates available. While real incomes for the poorest five 
percent of the population have been falling and may continue to fall, 
the health care costs they will now have to pay are likely to continue 
to rise, particularly since individual health plans are the costliest on 
the planet. "The Bill will worsen the complex and costly administrative 
system that wastes funds needed to pay for actual health services," says 
Alice Rothchild, MD, Board President of the Alliance to Defend Health 
Care. The Bill is also likely to encourage employers currently providing 
health care for their workforce to push employees into the individual 
mandate, as the fees imposed by the new legislation on employers not 
covering their workers are far lower than the costs of the 
poorest-quality workforce health plans in the State.

<p>"This Bill is going to exacerbate the crisis in Massachusetts health 
care," comments Sandy Eaton, RN, Chair of Mass-Care. "It will move more 
people into individual health plans, the costliest and most wasteful 
insurance plans on the planet, without taking any steps to contain the 
costs that neither the State, nor its employers or its residents can 
afford. Only a plan that consolidates health care finance and 
streamlines delivery, such as the single-payer model adopted 
successfully in much of the rest of the world, can provide quality, 
sustainable health care for all."
