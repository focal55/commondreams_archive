<p>FRIGATE BAY, St. Kitts and Nevis - June 21 - As the International 
Whaling Commission (IWC) meeting in St Kitts concluded its proceedings 
today, a peaceful protest carried out by Greenpeace was abruptly broken 
up by the authorities, who arrested ten activists and ship crew from the 
Greenpeace ship Arctic Sunrise. The protestors were attempting to 
highlight the number of whales killed during the last whaling season in 
the so-called Southern Oceans Whale Sanctuary.

<p>The protest involved activists and crew from the Greenpeace ship Arctic 
Sunrise, which had been barred from St Kitts waters when it arrived last 
weekend prior to the start of the IWC meeting. They arrived via 
inflatable boats to the beach in North Frigate Bay, St Kitts and were 
attempting to create a symbolic "whale graveyard" display using 863 
cardboard whale tails - one to represent each of the estimated whales 
caught by Japanese whalers in the Southern Ocean 'Whale Sanctuary' 
during the last year. However, the protestors were stopped and arrested 
by the police shortly after coming ashore, and currently are being held 
at the Basseterre Police Station in St Kitts awaiting further 
information on charges. (1)

<p>"To have arrests happen over a peaceful protest is ludicrous - the real 
safety issues are on the high-seas where whales are under threat and are 
being killed on an on-going basis," said Mike Townsley, Greenpeace 
International spokesperson. "It's about time the IWC and nations of the 
world take heed and realise that this slaughter cannot continue. 
Greenpeace is on the side of good by protecting whales and the 
environment they live in.

<p>"Greenpeace is a peaceful protest organisation and we will return to the 
Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary later this year, where we will continue 
to defend the 935 minke whales and ten fin whales which are the target 
of the Fisheries Agency of Japan's grenade tipped harpoons," concluded 
Townsley.

<p>Greenpeace's campaign for an end to whaling is part of the most 
ambitious ship expedition ever undertaken by the environmental advocacy 
organisation. The 14-month long "Defending our Oceans" expedition is 
exposing the key threats to our oceans and offering real solutions, a 
global network of properly enforced marine reserves covering 40 percent 
of the worlds oceans: places that will be protected from industrial 
exploitation and destruction, from industrial fishing and hunting, and 
places from which our oceans can begin the process of repair and recovery.
