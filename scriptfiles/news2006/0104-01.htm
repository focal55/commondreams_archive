<p>WASHINGTON - January 4 -  Members of the Christian Peacemaker Teams (CPT) will hold a public fast and witness in Lafayette Park outside the White House beginning 9 a.m., Jan. 6, as they wait for a meeting with President Bush. CPT confirmed on Nov. 29, 2005 that the four human rights workers missing in Baghdad on Nov. 26 -- Tom Fox, Norman Kember, Jim Loney, and Harmeet Singh Sooden -- are associated with their organization. CPT has maintained a presence in Iraq since October 2002, working to expose detainee abuses and offer nonviolent alternatives to end the occupation and militarization of the country.</p>
<p>   In a letter requesting a meeting with President Bush, CPT Co-Director Doug Pritchard wrote, &quot;For the past three years CPT has had an almost continuous presence in Iraq. That presence has allowed us to work closely with Iraqis from varied perspectives. We wish to share those stories and words of wisdom as a support and encouragement to the wise decisions you need to make as the President of the United States of America.&quot; Jonathan Wilson-Hartgrove, who has served as a delegate to CPT's Baghdad project said, &quot;January 6th is the church's celebration of the feast of Epiphany, when we remember the magi and the gifts they brought to Jesus and his church. As part of our celebration this year, we want to bring the wisdom of the East to Washington and share with the President what we have seen and heard. We bring our experiences as gifts that we hope can make for peace.&quot;</p>

<p>   CPT will maintain a continuous presence outside the White House until noon on Sunday, Jan. 9, or until a meeting with the President is granted. Participants in the &quot;Follow the Light Epiphany Fast&quot; will pray together on the hour and read statements from Iraqis who call for an end to the occupation of their country and request due process and humane treatment for all detainees. CPT Iraq Team member Cliff Kindy, who will participate in the fast, may be contacted via cell phone at 312-933-0546.
