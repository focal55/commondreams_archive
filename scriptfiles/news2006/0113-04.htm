<p>WASHINGTON - January 13 - Families USA will host a briefing at the National Press Club on Thursday, January 19th at 1:00 PM with leaders from the state of Maryland who promoted the “Fair-Share Health Care Plan.”  They will explain the significance and implications of this recently approved legislation, which will force large employers like Wal-Mart to offer at least minimal health care coverage. Similar legislation is pending, or is about to be introduced, in more than 30 other states.  

<p>The briefing will examine the national implications of the Maryland legislation.

<p>Yesterday, the Maryland legislature voted to override Governor Robert Ehrlich’s veto of the “Fair-Share Health Care Plan.”  Starting in 2007, all employers with 10,000 or more employees Maryland will be required to disclose the amount of money they spend on health coverage for their workers, dependents, and retirees. Private employers that spend less than 8 percent of payroll would pay the state the difference between what they spend on benefits and the 8 percent payroll amount. 

<p>Companies not doing their "fair share" could choose to increase their spending on health care benefits or pay into a special fund to help expand Medicaid eligibility in the state.  Currently, many Wal-Mart employees and their dependents are enrolled in Medicaid.
