<p>WASHINGTON - April 13 - Africa Action today 
challenged The Washington Post for its recent coverage minimizing the 
severity of the HIV/AIDS crisis in Africa. The organization emphasizes 
the real and ongoing urgency of the crisis on the continent, and 
strongly rejects attempts by The Washington Post to revive old debates 
questioning the value of HIV/AIDS treatment.

<p>Two pieces in The Washington Post in the past week - an article entitled 
"How AIDS in Africa was Overstated" (April 6) and an editorial on 
"Assessing AIDS" (April 10) - have disputed the accuracy of UNAIDS' 
estimates of HIV/AIDS infection rates in Africa. The pieces claim that 
the extent of the HIV/AIDS crisis in parts of Africa has been 
overestimated, and that the credibility of the United Nations on this 
issue will suffer as a result of "dubious AIDS data."

<p>Africa Action acknowledges the challenges faces by public health experts 
in their initial efforts to track the progression of HIV/AIDS in Africa, 
including the difficulties of analyzing a new disease and the 
constraints posed by weak "reporting systems" in developing countries. 
In recent years, as more information has become available about the 
course of HIV/AIDS, and as increased attention and resources have 
permitted more complete research, new estimates have emerged to replace 
earlier assessments of the extent of the disease and the rates of new 
infections on the continent.

<p>Africa Action emphasizes that the existence of such new data, which may 
in some cases indicate a lower infection rate than earlier estimated in 
some parts of Africa, does not discount the magnitude or severity of the 
HIV/AIDS crisis, which continues to devastate the continent. The 
organization cautions that such revisions in HIV/AIDS data should not be 
interpreted as an indication that the HIV/AIDS pandemic in Africa is 
less serious than originally thought; by any estimates, at least 20 
million people in Africa are currently living with HIV/AIDS and some 12 
million African children have already lost one or both parents to the 
disease.

<p>Africa Action strongly rejects the claim made in the Washington Post 
editorial of April 10th , that "prolonging the life of an HIV-positive 
adult is expensive and difficult." The organization notes that global 
activism in recent years has led to a widespread consensus around the 
right to affordable access to treatment for all those living with 
HIV/AIDS. The recognition of the value and importance of extending the 
lives of millions of people living with HIV/AIDS forms a critical part 
of a comprehensive global response to this pandemic.

<p>Last year, the leaders of the world's wealthy and powerful countries 
pledged to expand access to HIV/AIDS treatment to all those who need it 
by 2010. This political commitment marked an important acknowledgment of 
the principle that prolonging the lives of all people living with 
HIV/AIDS is a real possibility and a worthy goal. While noteworthy 
strides have been made in recent years in extending access to 
life-saving treatment to many people in Africa and other developing 
regions, barriers to universal access still exist and must be overcome.

<p>As Africa Action and other organizations in the U.S. and throughout the 
African continent continue to work to expand the availability of such 
treatment, the attempt by The Washington Post to re-open the debate over 
the value and feasibility of universal access is irresponsible and most 
unwelcome.
