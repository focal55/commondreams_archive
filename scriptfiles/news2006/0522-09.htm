<p>CHICAGO - May 22 - Celebrated Chicago author  Studs Terkel and prominent leaders in the medical, legal,  political and faith communities today filed a federal lawsuit  charging that telephone giant AT&amp;T violated their privacy by  secretly sharing the telephone records of millions of Americans  with the National Security Agency.   The secret program was  revealed in a May 11, 2006 article in USA Today.</p>
<p>   The prominent Chicago area professionals who filed the lawsuit  today note their special concerns with the government's gathering  of the phone records of innocent Americans.  As a journalist, for  example, Mr. Terkel wants the capacity to keep sources secret  from government scrutiny.  Lawyers, doctors and clergy members  rely upon confidentiality in order to best serve their clients,  patients and congregants.   Elected officials rely on the ability  to strategize and communicate with allies and others without the  federal executive branch monitoring their activities.</p>
<p>   In addition to Mr. Terkel, the other plaintiffs in the case  filed in federal district court in Chicago today include: Barbara  Flynn Currie, Majority Leader of the Illinois House of  Representatives; Rabbi Gary Gerson of Oak Park Temple; Professor  Diane Geraghty, Director of the Civitas ChildLaw Center at Loyola  University School of Law, Chicago; James Montgomery, former  Corporation Counsel for the City of Chicago; and, Dr. Quinten  Young, a physician and advocate for health care reform.  </p>

<p>   &quot;Having been blacklisted from working in television during the  McCarthy era, I know the harm of government using private  corporations to intrude into the lives of innocent Americans,&quot;  said Terkel.   &quot;When government uses the telephone companies to  create massive databases of all our phone calls it has gone too  far. &quot;</p>
<p>   The group of renowned plaintiffs contends that AT&amp;T violated  their individual right to engage in telephone conversations  without government monitoring under the Electronic Communications  Privacy Act.   That law, according to the complaint, prohibits  any entity providing &quot;an electronic communication service&quot; from  divulging the records of customers to governmental agencies.</p>
<p>   Without consent of customers or other lawful certification  authorized by a court order, according to published reports, the  National Security Agency sought the records of tens of millions  of telephone customers in the United States.  Indeed, when  Denver-based Qwest Communications asked the NSA for the legal  authority behind their request to that company for telephone  records, the NSA discontinued the request.</p>
<p>   &quot;For the individuals we represent today, the ability to act  without government oversight and intrusion is critical to the  function of their profession,&quot; said Harvey Grossman, Legal  Director for the ACLU of Illinois representing the five  plaintiffs.  &quot;The NSA program, if unchecked, interferes with the  ability of lawyers to deal with clients, doctors to treat their  patients and clergy to counsel members of their congregation.&quot;  </p>

<p>   The plaintiffs have asked the federal court to certify a class  of Illinois residents who use AT&amp;T for telephone service and to  enjoin AT&amp;T from divulging any further information to the NSA.    The plaintiffs will seek a prompt hearing on their request for a  preliminary injunction.  </p>
<p>   &quot;The disclosure of the NSA program was of grave concern to  me,&quot; added James Montgomery.   &quot;If people seeking legal advice or  representation know the government is monitoring who I am calling  or who is calling me, they may be less inclined to seek that  advice.&quot;   The NSA program, then, limits a lawyer's ability to  help those in need.&quot;</p>
<p>   The national ACLU, which filed a legal challenge in January to  the NSA's warrantless wiretapping, also is of counsel in today's  lawsuit.  </p>
<p>   &quot;Our corporate and political leaders should talk straight with  the American people about these secret demands for customer phone  records,&quot; said ACLU Executive Director Anthony Romero.  &quot;Whether  the government is monitoring or intercepting the domestic and  international calls of millions of Americans without warrants  goes to the heart of our system of checks and balances.&quot;   </p>

<p>   Chicago attorneys William Hooks of the Hooks Law Offices and  Marc Beem and Zachary Freeman of the law firm Miller, Shakman &amp;  Beem, are assisting the ACLU of Illinois in the case.  </p>
