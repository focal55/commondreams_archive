<p>WASHINGTON- July 17 - 

<i>Congressman Dennis J. Kucinich (D-OH) issued the following statement today on the continuing violence in the Middle East:
</i>
<p>“The continuing violence in the Middle East is spiraling out of control and everyday brings the world closer to the brink of a full-blown regional war in which there will be no winners. 



<p>“The US has a moral obligation to become engaged diplomatically, immediately. The region urgently needs diplomatic assistance. The US must reclaim its role as a mediator. 



<p>“Time is running out.  Violence is escalating. Innocent civilians are being killed. 



<p>“As the region continues to erupt in violence that worsens by the day, our soldiers in Iraq are becoming increasingly at risk. 



<p>“Extremists in the region have made clear their intention to use the unrest in the region to retaliate against US troops currently serving in the region -particularly in Iraq. Everyday of diplomatic inaction puts our troops at greater risk. The presence of our troops in the region --where conflict is growing—increases the chances that they could be dragged into a wider conflict.   



<p>“Our presence in Iraq is counterproductive. Our troops are caught in the crossfire of a civil war that is increasing deadly. It is time to support our troops by bringing them home.



<p>“It is impossible to separate the failed US policy in Iraq from the broader regional conflict. This Administration’s actions in Iraq have left the region considerable less stable. 



<p>“The solution is not only to immediately engage diplomatically in the region, but also to remove our troops from Iraq. 



<p>“This Administration which has an unfortunate talent for war, must actively seek a peaceful solution to the growing regional conflict, and make immediate preparations to bring our troops home.
