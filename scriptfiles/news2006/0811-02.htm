<p>RESTON, Virginia - August 11 - The American Medical Student Association (AMSA) supports policies and programs which increase the access and affordability of higher education: Take action today to urge the federal Commission on the Future of Higher Education to change the provision in the latest draft report of the Commission that encourages students to take out private loans as opposed to federal student loans. 

 

<p>AMSA is concerned with new language in the Commission’s recent August 3rd draft report that suggests cutting 50-75% of federal student aid. The proposal to eliminate unsubsidized and PLUS (Parent Loan for Undergraduate Students)student loan programs is accompanied by the recommendation for the vast majority of students seeking education funding to do so through private loans. The change in the federal aid allowance the Commission recommends would cost borrowers at least $32 billion in additional interest payments on loans taken out within the first five years of this policy (based on the current private loan interest rates). 

 

<p>Private loans increase the burden of debt that students face, due to their higher cost and lack of borrower protections. The burden of debt and decreased access of medical students to federal loans will reduce diversity in the physician work force and affect practice choice, which does both patients and the medical profession a disservice. 

 

<p>Although AMSA agrees with and strongly supports the federal Commission on Higher Education’s mission to assure equal access to educational opportunities, we feel recommending students to take out private loans directly hinders progress towards this stated mission. 

 

<p>“In regards to the present student financial aid system, AMSA believes the focus should remain on increasing grant aid and making loan repayment more manageable. It is our hope that the Commission would advocate for policies that encourage affordable higher education,” said AMSA President Jay Bhatt. 

 

<p>On August 10, the Commission will meet to finalize its recommendations. AMSA encourages you to take action NOW by contacting the Commission for Higher Education’s public comment line at (202) 205-8741 or by sending an email to <a href="mailto:HigherEdCommission@ed.gov">HigherEdCommission@ed.gov</a>.

<p>You can also email the Chairman of the Commission through PIRG's Student Debt Alert: <a href="http://www.studentdebtalert.org/alert.asp?id=1646">www.studentdebtalert.org/alert.asp?id=1646</a><p><b>About the American Medical Student Association <br>
