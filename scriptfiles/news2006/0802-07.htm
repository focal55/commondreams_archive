<p>LONDON - August 2 - ActionAid is outraged by the death, injury and displacement of innocent people in the conflict in the Middle East.&nbsp; We support the call for an immediate cease fire.</STRONG></P>
<P>Ramesh Singh, CEO of ActionAid, said “The indiscriminate attacks resulting in high number of civilian casualties are unacceptable and show total disrespect for basic human rights and international humanitarian law.</P>
<P><STRONG>Free access</STRONG></P>
<P>“We are appalled by the targeting of civilians, the disproportionate scale of hostilities and violation of national sovereignty.&nbsp; We stand in solidarity with our partners in Lebanon in their call for an immediate cease fire, without which there can be no progress towards a sustainable peace.</P>
<P>“We also add our voice to calls for humanitarian actors to be given free and unimpeded access to populations in need of relief, in accordance with Article 10 of the Geneva Convention. We are concerned that the negotiation of ‘humanitarian corridors’ means that assistance will only be allowed through to certain areas.</P>
<P><STRONG>Refugee status</STRONG></P>
<P>“We join the international humanitarian community in asking the UNHCR and governments to extend prima facie refugee status to those fleeing across borders from the conflict. That begins with acknowledging that those persons fleeing Lebanon are, indeed, refugees and not just "displaced persons".</P>
<P>“Civilians are bearing the brunt of this conflict. The psychological impact of the violence will have long term effects on people witnessing the death of family members, and the destruction of their homes and communities.</P>
<P><STRONG>Emotional damage</STRONG></P>
<P>“We know from our experience working with traumatised communities in conflicts and emergencies that displacement impacts on every aspect of a family’s life. Losing homes and jobs means that people are now much more vulnerable not only to poverty and poor health, but also to long-term psychological and emotional damage.”</P></p>
