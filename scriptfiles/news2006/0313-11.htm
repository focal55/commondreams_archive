<p>NEW YORK  - March 13 - Reacting to calls to censure President Bush for illegal domestic wiretapping, today the Center for Constitutional Rights (CCR) urged Congress to go beyond censure and conduct a full investigation of both the wiretapping and the grounds for impeachment.  Legal Director Bill Goodman, a member of the CCR team suing President Bush for warrantless wiretapping, put the censure resolution in context:

 

<p>“When President Bush admitted he was breaking the law to spy on Americans, he dared the courts and Congress to stop him.  The courts will have the chance to stop him when they rule on our case, and Congress is finally debating how to hold the President accountable.  The fact that the Senate is seriously considering censure for the first time in 160 years shows that the President is out of control.  But a censure resolution won’t remove a single wiretap from Americans’ phones.  President Bush broke the law and promised to continue to betray his oath of office and our Constitution – that’s the definition of an impeachable offense.  We will continue to sue for an injunction against illegal wiretapping and call on Congress to stop President Bush’s illegal actions and remove him from office.”

 

<p>The U.S. Senate’s consideration of censure comes at a particularly critical time for challenges to the illegal wiretapping program. Last week, CCR filed a decisive motion in its federal suit against President Bush, arguing that he has already admitted enough incriminating facts to prove the NSA Program is illegal (CCR v. Bush).  The motion for summary judgment called for an injunction to bar the government from continuing its illegal spying on Americans.  The filing is available at www.ccr-ny.org.

 

<p>CCR has a long and effective record of protecting constitutional rights endangered by illegal Presidential actions such as warrantless wiretapping.  CCR helped terminate illegal wiretapping by the Nixon Administration and helped bring the landmark 1972 Supreme Court decision establishing the illegality of warrantless domestic surveillance (United States v. United States District Court).
