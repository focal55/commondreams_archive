<p>WASHINGTON - September 29 - U.S. Senator Russ Feingold (D-WI) has introduced 
          a resolution calling for more resources to prevent Afghanistan from 
          becoming a key staging ground for terrorists in our continued fight 
          against al Qaeda, its affiliates and its sympathizers. Feingold, a thirteen-year 
          member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, is introducing the 
          resolution to refocus attention on Afghanistan, where a resurgent Taliban 
          has destabilized the country&#8217;s southern region, opium production 
          levels have reached record levels, and violence is on the rise throughout 
          the country. The resolution is cosponsored by Senator John Kerry (D-MA).
<p>Feingold said, &#8220;If we don&#8217;t strengthen our efforts to defeat 
          the Taliban and to create long-term stability in Afghanistan and the 
          region, Afghanistan will remain what it was on 9/11 &#8211; a haven 
          for those who seek to harm our country, and a source of instability 
          that will continue to threaten our national security.&#8221; </p>
          
        <p>During his testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee 
          on September 21, 2006, General James Jones, NATO commander and commander 
          of European Command, said that &#8220;these are difficult times for 
          Afghanistan...If we want to succeed in Afghanistan, the answer is clear: 
          Afghanistan needs more sustained support from the international community.&#8221; 
          Both Jones and the NATO Secretary General have recently called for additional 
          troops, something Feingold supports. Feingold&#8217;s resolution calls 
          for increased resources across the board for counter-insurgency, counter-narcotics, 
          reconstruction and diplomatic efforts. </p>
          
        <p>&#8220;I supported the decision to go to war in Afghanistan, but this 
          administration took its eye off the ball by focusing on Iraq. Unless 
          we ramp up our efforts in Afghanistan, we risk leaving behind a weak 
          government susceptible to the kind of extremism responsible for the 
          attacks on our country on 9/11,&#8221; Feingold said. &#8220;Afghanistan 
          could be a major victory in the international fight against terrorist 
          networks, but only if we are willing to give it the attention and resources 
it demands.&#8221;</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
