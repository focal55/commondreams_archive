<p>WASHINGTON - June 9 - American Rivers today  praised action in the U.S. Congress to shut down the Mississippi  River Gulf Outlet (MRGO) shipping channel that was a significant  cause of the catastrophic flooding in the New Orleans metro area  following Hurricane Katrina in 2005.  Studies by Louisiana State  University's Hurricane Center have concluded that MRGO amplified  and funneled Katrina's storm surge directly toward the levees  that protected the city's Ninth Ward and St. Bernard parishes,  breeching them, flooding neighborhoods, and killing hundreds of  people.</p>
<p>   &quot;I'm sick at heart that we couldn't get the Corps to listen on  MRGO before people died,&quot; said Rebecca Wodder, president of  American Rivers.  &quot;We're back in hurricane season, and it's hard  to overstate the urgency of shutting down this menace to New  Orleans.&quot;</p>
<p>   Along with the direct damages caused by MRGO, the project  destroyed more than 20,000 acres of coastal wetlands that would  have helped blunt the storm surge.  Intended as a shipping  channel, MRGO has never come close to meeting the economic  performance the Corps predicted for it.</p>
<p>   &quot;MRGO never made sense in the first place, and now it's time  to stop it before it kills again,&quot; Wodder said. &quot;Senators  Landrieu, Jeffords, Vitter, and Inhofe have done an outstanding  job of educating their colleagues about the dangers of the MRGO  and pushing the full Congress to support closure of this  monstrosity.&quot;</p>
<p>   The ill fated MRGO navigation channel has been blamed for the  overtopping and breaching of the levees and flood walls that  swamped the Lower 9th Ward, St. Bernard Parish, and the heart of  New Orleans, causing hundreds of deaths in the aftermath of  Hurricane Katrina.  Additionally, many blame it for the flooding  of those same areas during Hurricane Betsy in 1965.</p>
<p>   The closure plan, championed by Sens. Landrieu (D-La.), Vitter  (R-La.), Inhofe (R-Ok.), and Jeffords (I-Vt.),will at a minimum  de-authorize deep draft navigation on the MRGO while restoring  wetlands destroyed by the construction and operation of the  channel.  In addition to reducing the threat to New Orleans and  its surrounding parishes, these actions will help restore  Louisiana's rapidly vanishing coastal wetlands by stopping salt  water intrusion up the channel, which has been a major cause of  significant wetlands loss in the area.  This in turn will help  reduce future storm surges in the region.</p>
