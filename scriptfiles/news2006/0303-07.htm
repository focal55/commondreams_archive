<p>JOHANNESBURG, 
South Africa  
- March 3 - Case studies gathered by ActionAid from countries across the globe will form the basis of the official debates at this month’s International Conference on Agrarian Reform and Rural Development.

 

<p>ActionAid will present international studies and gather women from South Africa, Cambodia, India, and Uganda and from diverse areas of Brazil to present to ministers, presidents and around 1500 delegates from 190 countries when they gather in Porto Alegre next week. (7 - 10 March).  


<p>ActionAid will actively participate in the conference, bringing an international delegation with representatives from Ethiopia, Mozambique, Nepal, Uganda, India and Sri Lanka. Case studies from these countries will form the base for the Conference’s official debates.

 

<p>“This is an opportunity for poor people around the world bring their claims of a true land reform that should ensure their rights to access and control land and other natural resources. It’s also time to say a firm NO to the market land policies promoted by the World Bank,” says ActionAid’s regional director for the Americas, Adriano Campolina

 

<p>The studies developed in Uganda and in India show the problems women have on safe access to land. Sri Lanka’s case study is about post-Tsunami land and the Nepalese report speaks about the ethnic minorities traditional access rights regulation. 

 

<p>The two African studies are about Mozambique and Ethiopia’s experiences, where land is nationalized; and traditional communities access to land and resources is restricted.  

 

<p>ActionAid will promote several parallel activities, such as a seminar on women's rights and access to land and natural resources, which will involve partner organizations from several countries. 

 

<p>ActionAid will also promote interchange activities between the different social movements and organisations attending the Conference.
