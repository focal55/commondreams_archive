<p>SAN FRANCISCO - APRIL 25 - Today Craig Williams, 
Director of the U.S. Chemical Weapons Working Group 
(CWWG), was awarded the prestigious 2006 Goldman 
Environmental Prize. The $125,000 Prize, created by 
philanthropist Richard N. Goldman in 1990, is awarded 
annually to six grassroots "environmental heroes"- one 
from each of six continental regions. It is the largest 
award of its kind in the world.

<p>Mr. Williams, who organized the CWWG and has 
guided the national citizens' coalition for 15 years, was 
chosen to receive the award for North America. He was 
honored for his unprecedented success in effecting 
environmentally protective changes in Pentagon 
decisions concerning destruction of the US stockpile of 
chemical weapons. 

<p>Specifically, Mr. Williams and the CWWG successfully 
prevented plans by the world's biggest bureaucracy - the 
Pentagon - to burn chemical weapons at four of eight 
chemical weapon stockpile sites in the U.S. This was 
accomplished through grassroots activism that resulted 
in a national law which required the Pentagon to:
<p>
<ul>
<li>identify, test and deploy destruction technologies that 
    are safe for the environment and residents of affected 
    communities, rather than the Army's preferred and 
    dangerous option of burning the weapons; and<br>
<br>
</li>
<li> include citizens as participants in making decisions 
    throughout the entire destruction process.</li>
</ul>
<p>As one of six Prize recipients, Mr. Williams is among 
"the most important people you have never heard of," 
according to Mr. Goldman. "All of them have fought, 
often alone and at great personal risk, to protect the 
environment in their home countries. Their incredible 
achievements are an inspiration to all of us." 
Mr. Williams joins other anti-incineration activists from 
around the globe who have been recognized with the 
Goldman prize over the years. In 2003, Von Hernandez, 
then Co-Coordinator of GAIA (Global Anti-Incinerator 
Alliance) received the award. The Chemical Weapons 
Working Group is a member of GAIA. For a full list of 
previous winners, please see www.goldmanprize.org.

<p>The CWWG´s Elizabeth Crowe, an active member of 
GAIA since its founding meeting in South Africa in 
December 2000, said: "Neither the U.S. nor any other 
government can continue to claim that incineration is the 
only way to get rid of stockpiled chemical wastes. We 
have demonstrated that viable alternatives exist and 
many of these technologies could be applicable for 
PCBs, obsolete pesticides and other stockpiled 
hazardous waste around the world."

<p>In accepting the Prize Mr. Williams also spoke of being 
inspired by his fellow winners throughout the years. He 
said, in part, "I am honored to be in the presence of my 
fellow recipients and I am humbled by their 
accomplishments. I know that all the work represented 
by these dedicated citizens of the world has made it 
easier for each of us to work for healthy environments in 
our own communities. Tonight by awarding a few we 
also honor the important work of hundreds of thousands 
of people world wide."

<p>Mr. Williams was presented with the award in the San 
Francisco Opera House. From California, the Prize 
recipients will travel to Washington, D.C. for a second 
Prize Ceremony, a press conference and additional 
activities in the nation´s capitol.
