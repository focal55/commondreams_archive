<p>WASHINGTON - June 27 - 
<p>   -- Rallies at 300 Gas Stations Nation-Wide Protest GOP Ties to  Big Oil </p>
<p>   -- 'Red Handed' TV Ad Campaign Highlighting Republican Culture  of Corruption Shifts to Grassroots Action</p>
<p>   -- MoveOn Members to Call for an 'Oil Free Congress' and Clean  Energy Policy</p>
<p>   This Wednesday at more than 300 gas stations across the  country, thousands of MoveOn members will hold &quot;Rallies for An  Oil-Free Congress,&quot; exposing Republicans in Congress for  accepting campaign contributions from Big Oil companies while  they do nothing to ease the burden of Americans who are paying  more at the pumps.</p>
<p>   The rallies are part of a National Day of Action, echoing the  &quot;Caught Red Handed&quot; theme of MoveOn's latest TV ads that tie the  Republican-controlled Congress to the culture of corruption.  MoveOn.org Political Action just completed three rounds of a $1.3  million campaign in the districts of Republican Reps. Chris  Chocola, Thelma Drake, Nancy Johnson and Deborah Pryce. </p>
<p>   &quot;Big Oil companies have given millions in campaign  contributions to the Republican controlled Congress, but that  pales in comparison to the billions they've received in tax  breaks and subsidies. Republicans have consistently rejected  Democratic attempts to move toward energy independence and a  national clean energy policy. With gas prices soaring and global  warming a deepening threat, it's time to stop America's addiction  to oil -- by curing Republicans' addition to oil money,&quot; said  Nita Chaudhary of MoveOn.org Political Action.</p>
<p>   Since 1990, Big Oil has given more than $190 million to  members of Congress -- 75 percent of which has gone to  Republicans. </p>
<p>   To attend a local &quot;Rally for an Oil-Free Congress,&quot; please  contact Trevor FitzGibbon at 202-246-5303 or Jessica Smith at  202-822-5200.</p>
