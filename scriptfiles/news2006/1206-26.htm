<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p>As a mother, grandmother and now even great-grandmother I have lots of shopping I want to do for this holiday season. This is a busy time of year and there is much I'd love to buy. Like many others, I don't have enough money to do it all, so I have to think before I shop.</p>
<p>I have to think about what to buy and where to shop. Good quality and affordable price are major considerations but they are not the only important things. I want my choices to be for the good of my family and my community, and women are an incredibly important part of my community. </p>
<p>So, despite the lure of low prices, I'm joining other women in Seattle on Thursday to urge shoppers to think before they shop at Wal-Mart. </p>
<p>I won't be shopping at Wal-Mart because Wal-Mart really is bad for women.</p>
<p>Of course, discrimination against women is common in corporate America and I can't guarantee that every place I shop treats women well. But Wal-Mart is the world's largest employer and one of the worst abusers of its women employees in the U.S.</p>
<p>It isn't just that Wal-Mart doesn't pay a living wage; it's that they pay women even less than men in the same positions. Women make up more than 70 percent of Wal-Mart's hourly employees but less than one-third of its store management. Only one of its top 20 officers is a woman. And, in 2001, the few women who become managers earned $14,500 less than their male counterparts. Women hourly workers earned $1,100 less than men. These are a few of the reasons Wal-Mart is the subject of the largest class-action suit ever in this country. The lawsuit represents more than 1.5 million present and past employees of Wal-Mart and its affiliate, Sam's Club.</p>
<p>It goes beyond that. This year, Wal-Mart instituted a salary cap on its employees so they can only earn so much. Wal-Mart now uses more part-time workers. If you work fewer than 34 hrs/week, you have to wait a year before being eligible for health insurance and, even then, your children cannot be included in the coverage. Full-time employees have to wait 180 days before they become eligible for health benefits. That's six months before you or your children can go to a doctor for any reason, even an emergency. Should a woman be one of the lucky ones who is eligible, and can afford to buy the insurance, she will learn that her health plan does not cover contraception.</p>
<p>We women are the shoppers in this country. In particular we are the ones who are most likely responsible for buying the basics -- food, clothing, shoes, school supplies, toilet paper and toys. These are the things Wal-Mart sells. If I choose to save money on each item by shopping at a Wal-Mart where the woman waiting on me can't afford day care, health care, food or even the contraceptives that might keep her family from growing larger than she can support, I am hurting her and a lot of other women. That is not good for me, my family or my community. </p>
<p>I know most of the women working at Wal-Mart are thankful they have a job, even one that underpays and possibly mistreats them. That is no reason for us to sit back and let the abuse continue. </p>

<p>Together, we can change Wal-Mart. Please think before you shop. You can learn about NOW work at <a href="http://www.now.org/issues/wfw/wal-mart.html">http://www.now.org/issues/wfw/wal-mart.html</a></p>
