<p>WASHINGTON - December 11 - 
The Future of Music Coalition (FMC) will release a new report,  &quot;False Premises, False Promises: A Quantitative History of  Ownership Consolidation in the Radio Industry,&quot; by a  teleconference with reporters on Dec. 13 at 1 p.m. EST. Data in  the report shows that radio ownership consolidation at the  national and local levels has led to fewer choices in radio  programming and harmed the listening public and those working in  the music and media industries, including DJs, programmers and  musicians.
<p>   &quot;When Congress passed the Telecommunications Act of 1996, the  radio industry changed drastically,&quot; said Peter DiCola, FMC  Research Director and the report's author. &quot;Historical data from  the industry reveal unprecedented consolidation and show that the  Telecom Act has backfired in terms of the FCC's goals of  competition, localism and diversity in radio. Commercial radio  now offers musicians fewer opportunities to get airtime and  offers the public a narrow set of overlapping and homogenized  programming formats.&quot;</p>
<p>   The report will be posted at <a href="http://releases.usnewswire.com/redir.asp?ReleaseID=77384&Link=http://www.futureofmusic.org">http://www.futureofmusic.org</a> at  noon. Key findings include:</p>
<p>   -- The top four radio station owners have almost half of the  listeners and the top ten owners have almost two-thirds of  listeners.</p>
<p>   -- The &quot;localness&quot; of radio ownership -- ownership by  individuals living in the community -- has declined between 1975  and 2005 by almost one-third. </p>

<p>   -- Just 15 formats make up three-quarters of all commercial  programming. Moreover, radio formats with different names can  overlap up to 80 percent in terms of the songs played on them.</p>
<p>   -- Niche musical formats like classical, jazz, Americana,  bluegrass, new rock and folk, where they exist, are provided  almost exclusively by smaller station groups.</p>
<p>   -- Across 155 markets, radio listenership has declined over  the past 14 years, a 22 percent drop since its peak in 1989. The  consolidation allowed by the Telecom Act has failed to reverse  this trend.</p>
