<p>WASHINGTON - February 6 - The East Timor and Indonesia <i>Action</i> Network (ETAN) has urged Xanana 
Gusmao, President of Timor-Leste, to veto the criminal defamation provisions 
contained in the country’s new Penal Code. 
<p>In a<a href="#letter"> letter to President Gusmao</a>, the group wrote &quot;One of the foundations of a 
democratic society is the ability of its people to speak truth to power. If 
Timor-Leste's government tries to suppress such speech, we fear for the future 
of your democracy and for the future stability of your nation.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;ETAN <a href="#see_also">joins</a> international journalist groups, Timor-Leste journalist and 
legal associations, East Timorese Catholic clergy, the UN Secretary General, the
<a href="http://www.etan.org/et2006/january/28/dailym30.htm#rice">U.S. Secretary of State</a> and others in urging East Timor's leaders to live up to 
their constitutional obligation to protect freedom of expression, not limit it,&quot; 
said John M. Miller, National Coordinator of ETAN. &quot;The new nation can only 
benefit from robust political debate; the proposed defamation provisions will 
stifle discussion.&quot; </p>
<p>East Timor's truth commission (CAVR) has also 
<a href="http://www.etan.org/etanpdf/2006/CAVR-Recommendations.pdf">recommended</a> that defamation not 
be criminalized. </p>
<p>The proposed law would impose unlimited fines for those convicted of criminal 
defamation. Penalties for defamation through the media are greater, as are 
penalties (three years in prison) if those defamed are performing &quot;public, 
religious or political duties.&quot; The truth of the statements would not 
necessarily serve as a defense. Legal analysts say that the Penal Code would 
grant greater protection to public officials than to others. Under current law, 
defamed individuals can sue for civil damages. </p>
<p>East Timor has ratified the major international human rights conventions 
which guarantee freedoms of speech and the press, incorporating these rights 
into East Timorese law. </p>
<p>ETAN advocates for democracy, justice and human rights for East Timor and 
Indonesia. For more information, see www.etan.org. </p>
