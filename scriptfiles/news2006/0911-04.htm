<p>NEW YORK  - September 11 - In 
the five years since the terrorist attacks of September 11, Americans have 
successfully kept the light of freedom shining even as the Bush administration 
has consistently violated the spirit and letter of our laws, the American Civil 
Liberties Union said today. <BR>&nbsp;<BR>"The hallmark of the past five years 
has been the administration's stunning dismissal of the rule of law and its 
willingness to trample on our Constitution," said ACLU Executive Director 
Anthony D. Romero.&nbsp; "This is our democracy, our America.&nbsp; We must not 
stand on the sidelines while the president abuses his power and diminishes 
American values."&nbsp; <BR>&nbsp;<BR>Since 9/11, the government has broadened 
its powers to allow law enforcement to secretly search our homes, monitor what 
we read and collect personal information on all of us such as medical, financial 
and phone records, even if it has nothing to do with terrorism -- and all 
without a court warrant. <BR>&nbsp;<BR>"But we have had successes in these 
years," Romero noted, pointing to the Supreme Court's rejection of the military 
commission system established by President Bush to try detainees at Guant&#225;namo 
Bay, and the recent federal court ruling rejecting warrantless wiretapping of 
Americans.&nbsp; <BR>&nbsp;<BR>"There is much more to do -- and Congress must 
now do its part and put an end to these abuses of power by demanding that the 
president uphold the Constitution and our tested system of checks and balances," 
he said. <BR>&nbsp;<BR>Looking back on the past five years, the ACLU has 
compiled a list of the "top ten" abuses of power since 2001, as well as the top 
civil liberties victories in response to those abuses.&nbsp; The abuses 
include:<P></P><UL><LI>Wiretapping of innocent Americans without court 
approval or Congressional authority;<LI>Torture, kidnapping and unlawful 
detention of prisoners;<LI>The growing "surveillance society" -- a 
combination of new technologies, expanded government powers and expanded 
private-sector data collection efforts;<LI>Spying on peaceful, 
law-abiding Americans who are exercising their First Amendment rights; 
<LI>Creation of the Guant&#225;namo Bay camp, where hundreds of prisoners have 
been held indefinitely, without charges or access to attorneys.</LI></UL>
<P>Victories for the rule of law and civil liberties 
include:</P><UL><LI>Congress' adoption of the "McCain Amendment" which 
helped bolster the rule of law in military interrogations;&nbsp;<LI>The 
dismantling of the massive "Total Information Awareness" spying program which 
sought to monitor, among other things, innocent Americans' financial, health, 
travel and credit card transactions;&nbsp;&nbsp;<LI>Prominent 
conservatives and conservative organizations joining the ACLU's fight to keep 
America safe and free;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<LI>The Supreme Court's landmark 
June 2006 ruling that the military commissions system established by President 
Bush to try detainees at Guant&#225;namo Bay is unfair and illegal;&nbsp; 
<LI>Recent court rulings rejecting government spying without a 
warrant.&nbsp;</LI></UL><P>&nbsp;The ACLU has posted its review online at <A class=noline_blue href="http://www.aclu.org/september11">www.aclu.org/september11</A>.&nbsp; The 
website includes audio podcasts from ACLU leaders and staff on the events of 
2001 and the fight for freedom in a changed world. <BR>&nbsp;<BR>"Over the past 
five years, the ACLU and its members have shown that the American people will 
not sacrifice their precious civil liberties," Romero concluded. "We have been 
there for America since 1920 and we will always be there to advocate 
aggressively for our fundamental freedoms." <BR>&nbsp;<BR>The ACLU will continue 
that fight in October at its national membership conference, which will include 
a lobbying day with members of Congress.&nbsp; For more information, go to <A class=noline_blue href="http://http://action.aclu.org/conference/index.html">http://action.aclu.org/conference/index.html</A><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;
