<p>CURITIBA - March 22 - Greenpeace today called upon  the 
188 states at the 8th meeting of the Convention on Biological Diversity 
(CBD) to maintain the moratorium on the field trials and commercial 
releases of Terminator seed technology which was agreed six years ago.

<p>"Some states like New Zealand along with a number of  biotech companies 
now want to sneak language into the text that would actually allow for a 
'case by case' assessment of such technologies to open the door to field 
testing, while they officially claim to uphold the moratorium", said 
Greenpeace International's Benedikt Haerlin from the Convention.

<p>"This technology threatens biodiversity, farmers rights and the 
environment - what is needed is a ban on these technologies and not an 
erosion of the moratorium under the pretext of scientific impact and 
risk assessment," said Haerlin.

<p>Terminators, or GURTS (Genetic Use Restriction Technologies), are a 
class of genetic engineering technologies which allow companies to 
introduce seeds whose sterile offspring cannot reproduce, preventing 
farmers from re-planting seeds from their own fields. The seeds could 
also be used to introduce specific traits which would only be triggered 
off by the application of proprietary chemicals provided exclusively by 
the same companies.

<p>Terminator technologies would allow companies to prevent the public from 
accessing the results of future breeding, which is the present rationale 
of plant breeders' rights and even patents. The moratorium adopted by 
the Convention on Biodiversity in 2000, discussed the need for more 
information on the socio-economic, cultural and environmental impacts of 
these technologies.

<p>"Nothing in the past six years has changed the status quo. Rather, all 
the additional information we now have on the impact of these 
technologies confirms that sterility is not a viable means to protect 
agricultural biodiversity, that it poses a potential threat to food 
security and that it would have severe impacts on the livelihoods of 
farmers around the world," concluded Haerlin.

<p>Greenpeace is part of the global campaign www.banterminator.org Greenpeace is an independent, campaigning organisation which uses 
non-violent, creative confrontation to expose global environmental 
problems, and to force solutions essential to a green and peaceful future.
