<p>WASHINGTON - March 15 - <p>   -- Anti-War Movement to Offer Voters a Pledge </p>
<p>   -- New group to launch Friday for 3rd anniversary of Iraq War,  seeking five million voters to sign pledge not to support pro-war  candidates</p>
<p>   -- Well-funded effort aims to make Iraq War &quot;an issue  candidates can't ignore&quot;</p>
<p>   <b>WHAT: </b>Voters for Peace, a new non-partisan group, will be  launched this Friday, March 17 -- the eve of the third  anniversary of the start of the Iraq War -- to highlight growing  public opposition to the war in Iraq and other wars of aggression  among disaffected Republicans, Democrats, and independents alike.</p>
<p>   Speakers representing the ideological spectrum will appear at  the National Press Club at 10 a.m. this Friday, March 17, to  formally launch the new organization. They will unveil results of  a new public opinion poll showing large numbers of voters would  sign a pledge not to vote for any candidate who does not make a  &quot;speedy end&quot; to the war in Iraq, and opposition to future wars of  aggression, a campaign position. </p>
<p>   Voters for Peace will unveil such a voter pledge on Friday,  and announce it aims to gather two million signatures on it this  year, and five million by the 2008 presidential election.  </p>
<p>   <b>WHEN:</b> Friday, March 17, 10 a.m. </p>
<p>   <b>WHERE:</b> National Press Club, First Amendment Room, 14th and F  Streets NW, Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>   <b>WHO:</b></p>
<p>   -- Linda Schade, spokesperson for Voters for Peace</p>
<p>   -- Michael Berg, father of Nick Berg, who was killed in Iraq </p>
<p>   -- Kara Hopkins, editor, American Conservative magazine</p>
<p>   -- Kevin Martin, executive director, Peace Action</p>
<p>   -- John Nichols, &quot;The Online Beat,&quot; The Nation magazine  (invited)</p>
<p>   -- Bill Scheurer, editor, The PeaceMajority Report</p>
<p>   -- Kevin Zeese, director, Democracy Rising </p>
<p>   A recent Zogby poll of active-duty troops in Iraq found nearly  three quarters want to end the occupation within a year. Voters  for Peace will announce the results of its own poll of the U.S.  public, which shows widespread support for its pledge drive and  for a swift withdrawal of troops.</p>
<p>   &quot;When policymakers distort the facts and manipulate public  opinion to justify wars of aggression in our name, it is the  public's right and duty to speak out and act,&quot; said Linda Schade,  an advisor and spokesperson for Voters for Peace. The group has  $1 million pledged for startup funding, and is developing both an  educational project and a 501c(4) organization for promoting an  end to wars of aggression. Its voter pledge will appear at  <a href="http://releases.usnewswire.com/redir.asp?ReleaseID=62368&Link=http://www.votersforpeace.us">http://www.votersforpeace.us</a>.</p>
