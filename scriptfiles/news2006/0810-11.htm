<p>WASHINGTON - August 10 - The American Civil Liberties Union of Eastern Missouri and the ACLU Women&#8217;s 
Rights Project filed a lawsuit today on behalf of a family that was denied a 
permit to live in the city of Black Jack because of a law that prohibits more 
than three people from living together unless they are related by &#8220;blood, 
marriage or adoption.&#8221;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&#8220;The City of Black Jack&#8217;s behavior is both 
pompous and unconstitutional,&#8221; said Brenda Jones, Executive Director of the ACLU 
of Eastern Missouri.&nbsp; &#8220;Black Jack&#8217;s attempt to criminalize people&#8217;s choice 
to live together as a family has earned international ridicule for 
Missouri.&#8221;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>Fondray Loving and Olivia Shelltrack live in a 
2,300-square-foot home in Black Jack, a suburb of St. Louis, with their three 
children.&nbsp; Because Loving is not the biological father of Shelltrack&#8217;s 
oldest child, the city has denied the family an occupancy permit for the home 
that they purchased.&nbsp; The family now faces fines of up to $500 every week 
for living in their home without an approved occupancy 
permit.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>Loving and Shelltrack have lived together with Shelltrack&#8217;s 
oldest child, 15-year-old Alexia, for 13 years.&nbsp; Katarina, 10, and Fondray, 
Jr., 9, are the biological children of both Loving and 
Shelltrack.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&#8220;The government has no business saying two consenting 
adults cannot live with their own children,&#8221; said Tony Rothert, Legal Director 
of the ACLU of Eastern Missouri.&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;The town rejected a proposal to 
change this outmoded law, so we have no choice but to go to court to protect the 
rights of this family.&#8221;&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>Emily Martin, Deputy Director of the 
ACLU Women&#8217;s Rights Project, noted that a court in North Carolina recently 
struck down that state&#8217;s 201-year-old ban on cohabitation in another case 
brought by the ACLU.&nbsp; &#8220;The government is using housing laws to impose its 
ideas of morality on residents, but there is nothing moral about denying a home 
to a family,&#8221; she said.&nbsp; <BR>&nbsp;<BR>Today&#8217;s lawsuit, <EM>Loving v. City of 
Black Jack</EM>, filed in the Circuit Court of St. Louis County, challenges the 
ordinance as a violation of the family&#8217;s rights to due process and equal 
protection under the U.S. Constitution, as well as family status discrimination 
under fair housing laws. The lawsuit names the City of Black Jack and several 
city officials as defendants. <BR>&nbsp;<BR>Attorneys for the ACLU are Rothert, 
Martin and Gerald P. Greiman of the law firm Spencer Fane Britt &amp; Browne LLP 
as cooperating attorney for the ACLU of Eastern Missouri.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>The 
petition can be found online at: <A class=noline_blue href="http://www.aclu-em.org/legal/legaldocket/currentcases/lovingvcityofblackjack.htm">www.aclu-em.org/legal/legaldocket/currentcases/lovingvcityofblackjack.htm</A><BR>&nbsp;
