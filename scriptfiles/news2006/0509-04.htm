<p>WASHINGTON - May 9 - The first federal housing  assistance aimed specifically at poor households harmed by last  year's hurricanes could fall victim to House-Senate differences  over emergency supplemental funding legislation, even though this  funding is unrelated to &quot;earmarks&quot; that House leaders have vowed  to eliminate from the Senate-passed bill, according to the Center  on Budget and Policy Priorities.</p>
<p>   The Senate bill includes $202 million in funding for  hurricane-related rental assistance, the same amount requested by  the Administration.  The Senate bill sets aside $100 million of  this amount for special housing vouchers known as &quot;project-based&quot;  vouchers (described below), which would make a modest percentage  of the housing that is being rebuilt in the Gulf Coast affordable  to working-poor families, seniors, people with disabilities, and  other vulnerable residents who have so far been left out of  federal hurricane rebuilding aid.</p>
<p>   However, the Senate bill also contains various earmarks and  other special-interest items that have contributed to pushing its  cost $14 billion above the President's requested level.  As  House-Senate negotiators seek to reduce the cost of the final  bill, the hurricane-related housing assistance -- which is not in  the House version of the bill -- could be kept out of the final  bill even as a number of earmarks or other special-interest items  are retained.</p>
<p>   &quot;In general, the backers of the earmarks in the Senate bill  have more political clout than the impoverished hurricane victims  who would benefit from the housing assistance the Administration  and the Senate have requested,&quot; noted Robert Greenstein,  executive director of the Center on Budget and Policy  Priorities.  &quot;The fear is that Congress could kill the modest  low-income housing assistance to make room for more of the  special-interest items.&quot;</p>
<p>   Hurricanes' Neediest Victims Ignored by Rebuilding Assistance  to Date</p>
<p>   &quot;Lower-income Gulf Coast residents are at risk of being left  out of the rebuilding efforts,&quot; said Bart Harvey, Chairman,  President and CEO of Enterprise Community Partners, which is  providing development capital and expertise to the rebuilding of  Gulf Coast communities.  &quot;This housing aid will help ensure there  are stable, safe, sustainable homes for the working poor -- as  well as supportive housing for people with special needs -- who  might otherwise have to remain in inadequate temporary housing  arrangements or be unable to return to the Gulf Coast.&quot;</p>
<p>   The Senate's $100 million in project-based voucher funding  would address a major need that federal hurricane recovery  assistance has so far ignored.  Rents in the hurricane-affected  area have risen sharply –- 25 percent or more in the hardest-hit  areas -- because units not damaged or destroyed by the hurricanes  are now in short supply.</p>
<p>   The lack of affordable housing is impeding the Gulf Coast's  economic recovery.  Many businesses are reluctant or unable to  reopen until more of their workers and customers return, and many  modest-income families are unable to return because they cannot  find affordable housing.  While Congress has provided substantial  funding for housing reconstruction in the Gulf Coast through Low- Income Housing Tax Credits and Community Development Block Grant  funds, none of those funds have been targeted on poor households,  who are the least likely to be able to cope with the recent sharp  rent increases.</p>
<p>   The Senate bill would help address this problem by providing  $100 million in &quot;project-based&quot; voucher funding for the Gulf  Coast region, enough to provide rental subsidies for about 13,500  apartments.  The funding would be used both to reduce the rents  in newly constructed apartments and to repair certain apartments  that were subsidized by HUD before the hurricanes struck.</p>
<p>   Unlike traditional housing vouchers, which low-income families  use to rent a modest apartment of their choice in the private  market, project-based vouchers support the construction or  rehabilitation of housing for low-income families by giving  developers a guaranteed stream of rental revenue that can help  repay debts incurred during construction.  Project-based vouchers  also make new or rehabilitated units more affordable for working- poor families by helping to defray a portion of the rental costs.</p>
<p>   Of the 13,500 affordable apartments that could be funded with  the $100 million in funding under the Senate bill, 4,500 would be  set aside for supportive housing with services for low-income  people who are elderly, have disabilities, or were previously  homeless.  The rest of the 13,500 units would be available more  broadly to low-income working families and other needy people,  with households that were receiving housing assistance when the  hurricanes struck being given priority.</p>
<p>   &quot;These rental subsidies would provide a key resource to  support Louisiana's 'Road Home' housing plan, allowing the state  to help a large number of our most vulnerable citizens to access  safe housing and live with dignity,&quot; said Valerie Keller, member  of the Louisiana Recovery Authority's housing task force and CEO  of the Outreach Center, a faith-based organization in south- central Louisiana that has hired evacuees to help hundreds of  other displaced families rebuild their lives.</p>
<p>   The rental subsidies also would advance Mississippi's  recovery.  &quot;The Senate's plan would help Mississippi's Gulf Coast  working families participate in rebuilding the local economy,&quot;  observed Ed Sivak, Director of Policy and Evaluation at the  Enterprise Corporation of the Delta/Hope Community Credit Union,  a regional community development financial institution that has  been active in assisting families affected by the hurricane.</p>
<p>   New Information on Housing Needs Led Senate to Set Aside Funds  for Project-Based Vouchers</p>
<p>   The Senate Appropriations Committee set aside $100 million for  project-based vouchers out of the $202 million in funding for  temporary &quot;disaster housing vouchers&quot; that the Administration  requested.  Because fewer families than expected have qualified  for the special temporary &quot;disaster vouchers&quot; from HUD (which  Congress has limited to a narrow group of individuals), the  Senate Committee concluded that both the number of needed  disaster vouchers and the project-based vouchers could be  accommodated within the Administration's $202 million proposed  voucher funding level.</p>
<p>   &quot;It is vital that the funding for project-based rental  subsidies be retained in the final bill.  This assistance will  provide a critical tool to Gulf Coast communities to rebuild  rental housing in the most effective way, by creating housing  opportunities for the most vulnerable citizens in mixed-income  developments, with services available for people who need them,&quot;  said Barbara Sard, the Center on Budget's director of housing  policy.</p>
