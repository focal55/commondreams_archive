<P>WASHINGTON &ndash; February 8 - In an effort to&nbsp;help combat the spread of the H5N1 avian influenza virus to the United States,&nbsp;The Humane Society of the United States&nbsp;is calling on the Bush administration to&nbsp;adopt&nbsp;additional&nbsp;measures&nbsp;to&nbsp;help&nbsp;minimize the&nbsp;impact of&nbsp;pandemic influenza.</P>
<P>In a letter sent earlier this week to Department of Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff, The HSUS recommended several additional actions the government should take to help reduce the threat of H5N1 avian influenza to the United States and improve the effectiveness of the public response in the event of an outbreak. </P>
<P>Highlights of the recommendations:</P>
<UL type=disc>
<LI>To achieve public&nbsp;compliance with influenza containment efforts, include pets and other animals that require human care in pandemic influenza planning. Hurricane Katrina demonstrated that Americans are often unwilling to comply with&nbsp;government&nbsp;orders if they are forced to leave behind their pets.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<LI>Take additional measures to address the threat posed by the bird trade. The wild-bird trade is a high-risk practice that should be stopped by extending the current ban on the importation of birds from those countries with documented case of&nbsp;H5N1 in poultry, to all countries 
<LI>Work with state and local authorities to close live bird markets, fairs, exhibitions, and swaps. The USDA has recognized that live bird markets, fairs, and exhibitions provide an opportunity for the spread of avian influenza in birds reared for food.&nbsp; 
<LI>Provide clear directives against the culling of wild bird populations. The World Health Organization (WHO), the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), and the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) have advised against the control of avian influenza infection in wild bird populations, stating that it is not feasible and should not be attempted.&nbsp; 
<LI>Increase vigilance on the illegal trade in cockfighting birds. Cockfighting birds may be illegally imported into the United States, presenting yet another avenue for the introduction of avian influenza.&nbsp; 
<LI>Stop the shipment of birds on commercial airlines and through the mail. The USDA has recognized that moving birds from one place to another can spread diseases, particularly because some birds are asymptomatic and can carry disease without appearing sick.&nbsp;</LI></UL>
<P>"The federal government is rightly taking steps to prevent the introduction of bird flu into the U.S. as well as planning in the event it does reach our shores," said Wayne Pacelle, HSUS president and CEO.&nbsp; "More steps are absolutely necessary&mdash;such as cracking down on illegal cockfighting, the wild bird trade, and shipping live birds through air and mail&mdash;to ensure we are not playing Russian roulette with this crisis."</P>
<P>The letter was also sent to other administration officials with responsibility for particular aspects of these recommendations.</P>
<P>The Humane Society of the United States is the nation's largest animal protection organization representing more than 9.5 million members and constituents. The non-profit organization is a mainstream voice for animals, with active programs in companion animals and equine protection, disaster preparedness and response, wildlife and habitat protection, animals in research and farm animal welfare. The HSUS protects all animals through education, investigation, litigation, legislation, advocacy, and field work. The group is based in Washington and has numerous field representatives across the country. On the web at <A title=http://www.hsus.org/ href="/">www.hsus.org</A>&nbsp;</P>
