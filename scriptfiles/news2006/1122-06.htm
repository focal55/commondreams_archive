<p>WASHINGTON - November 22 - Military Families Speak Out (MFSO), a national organization of people opposed to the war in Iraq who have relatives or loved ones in the military, has members across the country who are approaching this holiday season with pain, tears and fear rather than holiday cheer. These are families with loved ones currently serving in Iraq, loved ones soon to deploy or redeploy, loved ones who have returned as hollow-eyed strangers suffering from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, or loved ones who will never again join them at any holiday table. 

 

<p>“This holiday season is going to be the hardest one for me,” said Sarah Lamb of Ft. Riley, Kansas, whose husband deployed to Iraq on October 4th. “The stress and the levels of emotion are beyond describing, as I sit and cry myself to sleep every night. I have little hopes or dreams for this holiday season. I’m even considering not putting up the lights and tree because of the emotional stress. All I want is for him to be home, not fighting an oil war.”

 

<p>“My son Lt. Michael J. Cleary was killed by a roadside bomb last December 20th, five days before Christmas and ten days before he would have returned home,” said Marianne Cleary of Dallas, Pennsylvania. “Our last conversation was the day before. His fiancée’s wedding shower was the day before that. Needless to say, we dread the upcoming season. Going into the store, seeing the decorations, hearing the Christmas songs, they all bring tears and feelings of despair.”
