This has been a busy political season for gun violence prevention advocates.&nbsp; By the spring, a number of incumbents and promising challengers had made it clear that they intended to highlight their support for sensible gun laws, moving the issue to Tier One in their races.&nbsp; The issue had a positive impact:&nbsp; <br />
<ul>
    <li>Ed Perlmutter in Colorado&rsquo;s Seventh Congressional District believes he won his primary in part because he advocated more common sense in gun laws.</li>
    <li>Massachusetts Gubernatorial candidate Deval Patrick also ended up winning his three- candidate primary while aggressively discussing tougher gun laws.&nbsp; </li>
    <li>In Illinois, Governor Rod Blagojevich made a state assault weapons ban his top goal for a second term, and Cook County, Illinois voters will cast votes on a referendum to instruct the State Legislature to pass an assault weapons ban.&nbsp; The referendum is expected to win handily.&nbsp; </li>
    <li>In New York, Andrew Cuomo has made gun violence prevention a central part of his campaign for Attorney General. </li>
    <li>In Maryland, Martin O&rsquo;Malley has announced he supports a state assault weapons ban, while incumbent Bob Ehrlich continues to oppose a ban.&nbsp; </li>
    <li>The new President of the Brady Campaign, Paul Helmke, has appeared personally at endorsement news conferences for Duckworth in Chicago, Patrick in Boston, and Cuomo in New York. Other Brady staff appeared at news conferences for Joe Sestak in Pennsylvania&rsquo;s Seventh Congressional District and for Governor Blagojevich in Illinois. </li>
</ul>
The Brady Campaign has already sent approximately 200,000 emails endorsing slates of candidates or specific candidates.&nbsp; In all, the organization will have sent nearly 400,000 emails in the three weeks leading up to the election<!-- #EndEditable -->
