<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --> <p> 		So my 
		son calls me today, and I answer the phone from my desk, and I guess I 
		was a little surly. “Whatcha grumbling about, Dad?” 
		&nbsp;</p>
		
		 <p>“I 
		think I’m hungry.” </p>
		
		 <p>“You’re 
		suddenly unable to feed yourself?”&nbsp;</p>
		

		 <p>“I 
		could feed myself just fine. In fact, one of the pharmaceutical 
		companies is offering a free lunch 20 feet away, and it smells like 
		fancy stuff.”&nbsp;</p>
		
		 <p>“Why 
		aren’t you there?”&nbsp;</p>
		
		 <p>“I 
		never go to those things. It’s fine for drug companies to invest in 
		research, but when they spend a fortune doling out food and propaganda 
		to doctors, it just drives me nuts.”&nbsp;</p>
		
		 <p>My son 
		paused for a second. That’s always a dangerous sign. You see, I’d 
		forgotten that he can be, well… political. “Dad, this is fantastic.”&nbsp;</p>

		
		 <p>“Before 
		you get any big ideas…”&nbsp;</p>
		
		 <p>“No, 
		really. This is great. You should lead a boycott. A boycott of 
		pharmaceutical graft!”&nbsp;</p>
		
		 <p>“Son…”&nbsp;</p>
		

		 <p>“No 
		doctor should take gifts from a drug company without disclosing the 
		gifts to their patients –- just like a politician can’t take money from 
		a lobbyist without disclosing this to his constituents!” 
		&nbsp;</p>
		
		 <p>“That’s 
		not really fair to my colleagues…”&nbsp;</p>
		
		 <p>“So? 
		Don’t you want to know if anyone giving you a recommendation is 
		compensated by the beneficiary of the recommendation?” 
		&nbsp;</p>

		
		 <p>“Son, 
		it’s embarrassing, but doctors can’t afford to blow off the drug 
		companies.”&nbsp;</p>
		
		 <p>“WHAT?”&nbsp;</p>
		
		 <p>“Calm 
		down, calm down. Here’s the thing. Our low-income patients are in 
		desperate need of the free samples we get from the drug companies. Free 
		samples keep them alive.”&nbsp;</p>
		

		 <p>“I’m 
		not saying I have a problem with that…”&nbsp;</p>
		
		 <p>“And 
		it’s not like pharmaceutical companies are all bad. The drugs 
		they&nbsp;develop save lives. And with the government slowing down its 
		investment in research, the big companies have picked up some of the 
		slack.”&nbsp;</p>
		
		 <p>“But on 
		the other hand, Dad…”&nbsp;</p>
		
		 <p>I 
		sighed. And admitted: “yeah, on the other hand, they spend&nbsp;more on 
		marketing than on research. They&nbsp;only
		
		support 
		the publication of research that boosts their products. They unleash an 
		army of attractive drug representatives to cozy up to physicians. The 
		reps offer free lunches, camaraderie that I confess really can&nbsp;brighten 
		a workday, and glossy brochures that highlight the success and&nbsp;obscure 
		the failure of their products. Meanwhile, their advertising directed to 
		patients generates demand that bears&nbsp;little relationship to real 
		needs.”&nbsp;</p>
		
		 <p>“Dad, 
		you’re a columnist. Write an article about this!”&nbsp;</p>
		
		 <p>“You 
		seem pretty charged up.”&nbsp;</p>

		
		 <p>“We 
		could write it together! We could ask every doctor to say no to the free 
		lunches and the glossy brochures. Don’t&nbsp;some
		
		
		hospitals and medical schools already do that? Doesn't Yale? We could 
		ask for more free samples, instead! And we could ask physicians and 
		patients who read this article to ask their&nbsp;elected representatives to 
		regulate pharmaceutical marketing! It’s the only way to change things, 
		Dad! We need a movement! Let’s&nbsp;ask doctors and patients to stand up for 
		honest marketing and for assistance to patients who can’t afford drugs 
		they need!”&nbsp;</p>
		

		 <p>I 
		confess, I was reluctant to&nbsp;get involved in this. But ultimately, I 
		realized — I paid for the man’s education, and he was right. So we wrote 
		this article, and we hope you’ll mention it to everyone you know, and 
		that this movement will catch on.&nbsp;</p>
