<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON - February 1 - Some of the Southwest's
most beautiful wildlife habitat and wilderness areas are suffering needless
damage as increased border enforcement activities in urban areas drives illegal
immigrant traffic into environmentally sensitive areas along the U.S. Mexico
border, according to a report released today by Defenders of Wildlife.
Compounding the problem is the accompanying Border Patrol enforcement
activities, including road and wall construction, off-road vehicle patrols, and
low-level helicopter flights. The report spells out several options for policy
makers seeking to secure our borders while also protecting national parks,
monuments, and wildlife refuges.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Current immigration and enforcement
activities along the border are destroying many of the Southwest's most
beautiful wilderness areas, but we don't need to destroy our nation's
wildlife, parks, and refuges to protect our national security. All it takes is a
little foresight and planning to protect these important places even as we
protect our borders," said Jamie Rappaport Clark, Executive Vice President
of Defenders.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The report focuses largely on the damage done to
the Arizona borderlands, in particular Arizona's two largest wilderness areas:
the Cabeza Prieta National Wildlife Refuge and the Organ Pipe Cactus National
Monument. These areas encompass more than one million acres of desert wilderness
and are home to a stunning array of imperiled wildlife including the Sonoran
pronghorn, jaguar, desert bighorn sheep, Gila monster, tropical kingbird, and
desert tortoise. But immigrant traffic and border patrol activities have
severely damaged these areas in ways that could take decades to repair. For
example:</font></p>

<blockquote>
 
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Illegal trails and roads carved by immigrants can destroy
    sensitive vegetation and wildlife habitat, and affect erosion patterns. The
    fragile desert soils and plants could take over a century to recover.
  </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Vehicles abandoned by illegal immigrants are expensive to
  remove and towing them causes additional damage.
  </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Trash and human waste left behind by illegal immigrants
  affects soil and water quality.
  </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Low level helicopter flights by the Border Patrol disturb
  wildlife and habitat areas.
  </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Off-road vehicle patrols damage sensitive regions vital to
  local wildlife.
  </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">U.S. road, light, and fence-building projects disturb
  wildlife, destroy habitat and shift animal migratory patterns.
</font></blockquote>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"The U.S.-Mexico border is a political line
that divides what is essentially one large environmental region on both sides of
the border. Many border activities, including illegal immigration and U.S.
border enforcement activities have enormous impacts on the region's wildlife,
landscape and economy," said Clark. "Already, many parts of our parks
and refuges are closed to the public – some are even closed to staff – because of the damage done by border activities."
</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Defenders' report comes at a time when
lawmakers in Congress are considering several bills to enhance border security
and address the illegal immigration issue. Several of the proposals include
extensive mandated border construction projects, including a wall along the
entire Arizona border. And just last year, President Bush signed into law a bill
that exempts many border projects from environmental laws designed to assess or
mitigate any damage they may cause, including the National Environmental Policy
Act, the Endangered Species Act, the Clean Water Act, and the National Historic
Preservation Act. Defenders' report offers several recommendations that will
allow us to protect our borders and the local environment:
</font>
<blockquote>
 
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Make use of innovative designs for needed construction
    projects to lessen their environmental impact.
  </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Outfit the Border Patrol with high-tech surveillance
  equipment to improve border security while minimizing environmental damage.
  </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Provide more information to affected border communities
  about ongoing and proposed border activities and give them a voice in the
  process.
  </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Assess the environmental effect of Border Patrol activities
  in the region and create the partnerships necessary to restore and protect
  these vital areas.
  </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Enlist the aid of conservation groups who stand ready to
  help repair the damage done and who are willing to be an effective planning
  partner for future border projects.
  </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Recognize that land management agencies like the U.S. Fish
  and Wildlife Service, the National Park Service, and the Bureau of Land
  Management can and should be partners in security and law enforcement
  activities and fund them accordingly.
  </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Making sure any new legislative initiatives take into
  account the need to protect our natural heritage, even as we secure our
  borders.
  
</font></blockquote>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"National security always comes first. But
proposed border construction projects, including large-scale fence building,
have the potential to severely harm wildlife and damage some of the Southwest's
most beautiful landscapes," said Clark. "Lawmakers advancing
immigration and border proposals can and should take into account the effect of
these proposals on our nation's wildlife, parks, and refuges and work to
minimize any damage. Fortunately, there are several simple steps that can be
taken that will allow us to secure our borders even as we protect local
communities and the environment."
