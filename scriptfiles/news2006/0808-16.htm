<p>NEW YORK  - August 8 - The American Civil Liberties Union and the New York Civil 
Liberties Union announced today that they have returned to court to challenge 
the constitutionality of the reauthorized Patriot Act's National Security Letter 
(NSL) provision. The provision permits the FBI to prohibit anyone who receives 
an NSL from disclosing that the FBI has sought or obtained information from 
them.<BR>
<BR>"The secrecy surrounding the FBI's use of national security letters is 
excessive and dangerous," said Jameel Jaffer, the ACLU lawyer who is lead 
counsel in the case. "By permitting the FBI to operate without meaningful public 
or judicial oversight, Congress has undermined important safeguards against 
abuse."<BR><BR>The ACLU filed the case in April 2004 on behalf of an Internet 
Service Provider that had received an NSL and was prohibited from disclosing 
that the FBI had sought information from it. In September 2004, the district 
court struck down the NSL provision as unconstitutional, with Judge Victor 
Marrero writing that "democracy abhors undue secrecy." In his landmark ruling, 
Judge Marrero held that indefinite gag orders imposed under the NSL law violate 
free speech rights protected by the First Amendment.<BR><BR>The government appealed 
the decision to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, and oral argument was heard 
in November 2005. Before the court issued a decision, however, Congress amended 
the NSL provision. In May 2006, the appeals court issued a ruling asking the 
district court to consider the constitutionality of the amended law. In a 
concurring opinion, Judge Richard Cardamone strongly criticized the government 
for continuing to argue that a permanent ban on speech would be permissible 
under the First Amendment.<BR><BR>"A ban on speech and a shroud of secrecy in 
perpetuity are antithetical to democratic concepts and do not fit comfortably 
with the fundamental rights guaranteed American citizens," wrote Judge 
Cardamone. "Unending secrecy of actions taken by government officials may also 
serve as a cover for possible official misconduct and/or incompetence."<BR><BR>Judge 
Cardamone added that national security concerns "should be leavened with common 
sense so as not forever to trump the rights of the citizenry under the 
Constitution."<BR><BR>The Internet Service Provider is still gagged and is 
identified as "John Doe" in the legal papers made public today. The legal papers 
were originally filed under seal because of the gag provision, and redacted 
versions were made available today under procedures put in place by the court. <BR>
<BR>In its legal papers, the ACLU argues that the gag provision, which is still 
present in the amended NSL statute, violates the First Amendment by giving the 
FBI the authority to suppress speech without prior judicial review. The ACLU 
also argues that the provision is unconstitutional because, while it permits 
courts to review gag orders after they are issued, the provision requires courts 
to defer to the FBI's view that secrecy is necessary.<BR><BR>The ACLU said that the 
gag provision has had significant effects on the John Doe plaintiff. John Doe 
was prevented from participating in the contentious Patriot Act reauthorization 
debate that raged across the nation in late 2005 and early 2006. Even though it 
had firsthand knowledge of this sweeping FBI power, the gagged Internet Service 
Provider could not mention the fact that it had received an NSL, divulge the 
breadth of the letter, or discuss the ramifications on its business 
relationships. According to news reports, the government now issues 30,000 NSLs 
every year. <BR><BR>"The Patriot Act dramatically expanded the FBI's authority to 
monitor the communications and activities of people living in the United 
States," said Jaffer. "Yet by permitting the FBI to silence those with direct 
experience of the new laws, Congress has denied the public any means of ensuring 
that the new surveillance authorities are being used lawfully and responsibly." <BR>
<BR>In a similar case, the ACLU represented four librarians who are on the board 
of Library Connection, a library consortium in Connecticut. The consortium was 
served with a NSL and challenged both the letter and the accompanying gag. After 
many months of litigation, the government withdrew its demand for information 
and abandoned the gag order. <BR>Last week, the Supreme Court ordered that legal 
documents in the case sealed by the government and the courts be made public. 
The documents revealed that government attorneys had censored, among other 
non-sensitive information, whole newspaper articles and direct quotes from 
Supreme Court opinions that undercut the government&#8217;s arguments in the 
case.<br>
