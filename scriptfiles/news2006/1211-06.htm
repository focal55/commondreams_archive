<p>WASHINGTON - December 11 - The American Civil Liberties Union today welcomed the 
introduction of bipartisan legislation authored by Senators Daniel Akaka (D-HI) 
and John Sununu (R-NH) that would add privacy and civil liberties safeguards to 
the Real ID Act. The "Identification Security Enhancement Act of 2006" would 
address several of the shortcomings of the controversial legislation adopted 
last year, including the establishment of a National ID.</P>
<P>"We applaud Senators Akaka and Sununu taking steps to fix some of the Real ID 
Act&#8217;s greatest privacy transgressions," said Caroline Fredrickson, Director of 
the ACLU Washington Legislative Office. "The 110th Congress must take 
affirmative actions to better protect the privacy and freedoms of all Americans. 
This bipartisan bill is a welcome first step, but more must be done to remedy 
the problems with the Real ID Act."</P>
<P>The Real ID Act was adopted last year as part of a must-pass military 
appropriations bill. The act rolls back civil liberties protections, attacks 
privacy rights and sets the stage for a national ID. Many diverse groups 
including the ACLU, the National Association of Evangelicals, the Ancient Order 
of Hibernians, the National Council of State Legislatures, the National 
Governors Association and the American Association of Motor Vehicle 
Administrators opposed the Real ID Act. Conservative estimates place the minimum 
cost of the program at $12 billion.</P>
<P>The Akaka-Sununu bill would eliminate most of the requirements that laid the 
foundation for a National ID card, such as the obligation that all data and 
systems be standardized. The bill also changes the approach to drivers&#8217; licenses 
by calling for more flexible "standards" instead of the current uniform 
mandates. In perhaps its most significant privacy fix, the legislation prohibits 
the use of license data by third parties, requires encryption of the data itself 
and preserves any state privacy laws that may provide greater protections.</P>

<P>"The Real ID Act is living on borrowed time; no act that repugnant to our 
Constitutional rights, burdensome to America&#8217;s drivers, and costly to taxpayers 
can or should be implemented," said Timothy Sparapani, an ACLU Legislative 
Counsel. "We urge lawmakers to demand explicit protections when they consider 
how to best restore the privacy and freedoms lost under Real ID, or else the 
Department of Homeland Security will likely again fail to protect Americans' 
privacy and civil liberties."</P>
