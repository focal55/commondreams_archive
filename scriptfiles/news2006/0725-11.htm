<p>WASHINGTON - July 25 - Families of U.S. troops who
are serving, have served, or were killed in Iraq converge in Washington
D.C. to participate in the last two weeks of &quot;&quot;Operation House Call&quot;<em>,&quot; </em>a
summer-long campaign to highlight the ongoing human toll of the war in
Iraq. Since June 22, members of Military Families Speak Out (MFSO) have
been staging an ongoing vigil outside the Cannon House Office Building
at Independence and New Jersey Avenues in Washington, D.C. Military
families from across the United States have brought their message
directly to the nation’s capital to confront Congress, highlight the
growing toll of the Iraq war and tell Senators and Members of Congress
to bring our troops home now and take care of them when they get here. </p>
<p><span>The
vigil features boots representing U.S. troops and shoes representing
Iraqi children, women and men who have been killed in the Iraq war
since June 15, when Congress voted to “stay the course” in Iraq, and
when the 2,500<sup>th</sup> troop death occurred.<span>&nbsp; </span>New pairs of boots and new shoes are added each day to reflect current deaths in Iraq.</span></p>
  <p><span>“My
wife Linda and I have three sons and two grandchildren who are all
Veterans of Operation Iraqi Freedom; since February, 2003 one or all of
them have been deployed – together they have spent 81 months in Iraq,”
said MFSO member Phil Waste from Tennessee. “Currently one son is
deployed to Iraq with the 1<sup>st</sup> Armored Division; another son with the 1<sup>st</sup>

Cavalry Division will be returning to Iraq this fall. The stress we
feel is unbearable, having loved ones in harm’s way in a war that
should never have happened. I want those serving in Congress to walk
past us and our vigil, and have to grapple with the true cost of this
war that they voted to continue,” he added.</span></p>
  <p><span>In addition to the on-going vigil in front of the Cannon House Office Building, &quot;Operation House Call&quot;
features visits by military families to Senators and Members of
Congress, and special press events with military and Gold Star families
and returned Iraq War Veterans. &quot;Operation House Call&quot; will
be continuing each day that Congress is in session until August 4, when
Congress recesses for the summer. At that time, MFSO members will
follow their elected officials back to their home states and districts.
“We are not going away. We will be engaging these elected officials
wherever they may go, until they show real leadership, and decide to
truly support our troops by bringing them home now and taking care of
them when they get here,” said Cathy Smith of Missouri, whose oldest
son was paralyzed from the chest down by an AK-47 round while serving
in Iraq, and whose middle son is currently serving in Iraq with the
Army. </span>  </p>
