<p>WASHINGTON - December 4 -Green Party leaders urged national support for 100 families who face
eviction from the Woodlands Apartment Complex in the Algiers area of New Orleans.&nbsp;
<p class="navigate">"In New Orleans and other Gulf Coast areas, middle- and low-income working people have been
          forced out of their homes twice -- first, because of Katrina, and then because of development plans
          designed to benefit wealthy real estate companies and landlords," said Louisiana Green Party member
          Romi Elnagar.  "The Green Party supports the Woodlands tenants and Common Ground, the New
          Orleans based non-profit that managed the property for the past five months."&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="navigate">Malik Rahim, who ran for New Orleans City Council in 2002 on the Green Party ticket, co-founded the
          Common Ground Collective &lt;<a href="http://www.commongroundrelief.org">http://www.commongroundrelief.org</a>&gt;
          in the wake of Hurricane Katrina.  The collective distributed aid and established a community health clinic,
          drawing support from across the U.S.&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="navigate">Common Ground has worked to transform Algiers and other neighborhoods into a model for just and
          sustainable alternative communities, and had succeeded in holding the rents at Woodlands to
          pre-Katrina levels -- the lowest in the city.&nbsp; Common Ground rehabilitated 100 units at
          Woodland, helped establish a strong tenants' union, and ran a workers' cooperative with
          paid skills training.&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="navigate">Rents in New Orleans are now double what they had been before the storm.  Powerful developers and
          landlords are evicting members of the historically predominant African American
          population and other working and poor residents from their homes.&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="navigate">Common Ground has called the landlord's actions illegal, noting that the previous landlord,
          Anthony J. Reginelli, along with two local police officers, had seized information and files from
          the Woodlands management office without warrant and taped eviction notices to the doors of
          Woodlands residents informing them that the complex had been 'transferred' to a new
          owner, Johnson Properties Group, LLC, which seeks their eviction.&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="navigate">The tenants, represented by lawyers from the New Orleans Legal Assistance Corporation (NOLAC) and
          supported by the Louisiana NAACP, are calling on Johnson Properties Group to share documentation
          of the improvements made in the last several months and to honor the tenants' current leases.&nbsp;
          But the new landlord has rebuffed attempts at communication.&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="navigate">"We've witnessed similar schemes by developers with enormous clout in city halls throughout the
          U.S.  But the evictions in New Orleans show a city placed on the fast track for displacement of
          current residents to turn one of America's oldest cultural capitals into an enclave for tourists
          and the wealthy," said Rebecca Rotzler, co-chair of the Green Party of the
          United States and Deputy Mayor of New Paltz, New York.  "Green Party leaders, candidates, and officeholders have
          consistently supported the rights of working people -- tenants and homeowners alike -- to
          stability and security in their homes.  Common Ground, responding to the post-Katrina emergency,
          has emerged as a leader and a national model in the movement for housing rights."&nbsp;</p>
