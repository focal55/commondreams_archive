<p>WASHINGTON - October 13 - Citizens for  Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) Executive Director  Melanie Sloan yesterday wrote to the House Committee on Standards  of Official Conduct, better known as the Ethics Committee, to  offer to testify under oath on CREW's handling of email exchanges  between former Rep. Mark Foley and a former congressional page.</p>
<p>   CREW received the emails in July and immediately forwarded  them to a special agent with the Federal Bureau of Investigation  (FBI).  Various inaccurate stories have circulated regarding  exactly what CREW sent the FBI and how the agency responded upon  receiving the emails, including false reports that CREW gave the  FBI redacted emails, that CREW refused to cooperate with the FBI,  and that CREW was ABC's source for Foley's emails and instant  messages.</p>
<p>   The full letter, the Foley email and instant message  exchanges, and all other related documents are available at  CREW's website.</p>
