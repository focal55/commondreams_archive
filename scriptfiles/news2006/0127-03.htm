<p>WASHINGTON - January 27 - At petition drives nationwide, members of MoveOn.org Political Action will demand targeted Representatives stop their corrupt practices when they return to Washington. There are more than 120 events taking place in target districts across the country. 

 

<p>Several high-profile Republicans have recently been indicted or accused of corrupt business practices in Washington. Republicans like Jack Abramoff, Representatives Tom DeLay and Bob Ney, Senator Bill Frist and former Cheney Chief of Staff Scooter Libby are all either under investigation, have stepped down from their posts or are currently under indictment. 

 

<p>“The Republican culture of corruption is out of control. We see the cost of corruption every day with laws like the Medicare drug debacle,” said Tom Matzzie, Washington Director of MoveOn.org Political Action. “Congress should swear off money from drug and insurance companies and support real reform with teeth.” 

 

<p>MoveOn members are calling on congress to pass significant corruption reform that will:

<p>Toughen and enforce ethics rules and punish violators; <br>

Rein in lobbyists including a ban on all gifts, travel and free meals; <br>

Require transparency and reporting; and <br>

Support public financing of elections.

<p>“We now know the chief lobbyist involved with the Medicare prescription drug bill was an ex-employee and close friend of Jack Abramoff. Architects of the new Medicare law fattened their wallets at the expense of seniors and taxpayers. We have to end the Republican culture of corruption through reform and at the ballot box,” Matzzie concluded.
