<p>NEW YORK  - November 20 - The American Civil Liberties Union appeared in court today to 
challenge the government&#8217;s appeal of an order directing the Defense Department 
to release 21 photographs depicting abuse of detainees by U.S. forces in 
Afghanistan and Iraq.
<P>&#8220;In this new climate of renewed checks and balances, the Bush administration 
should not be allowed to hide the truth, and individual leaders should never be 
allowed to subvert the law to cover up their misdeeds,&#8221; said Anthony D. Romero, 
ACLU Executive Director. &#8220;The ACLU is pursuing this fight on behalf of all 
Americans to keep our government honest.&#8221;</P>
<P>The government is appealing a district court order to release the 21 
photographs, once redactions have been made to obscurechambers. The ACLU, the New York Civil Liberties Union 
and the Center for Constitutional Rights have led a Freedom of Information Act 
challenge since 2003 to obtain records related to the treatment and death of 
detainees held in United States custody abroad, as well as the rend individually identifying 
features. The district court issued its ruling after first reviewing the 
photographs in private ition of 
detainees to countries known to employ torture.</P>
<P>This is the second time the government has attempted to withhold visual 
evidence of detainee abuse on the grounds that the public disclosure of such 
evidence would generate outrage, and would violate U.S. obligations towards 
detainees under the Geneva Conventions. Earlier this year, the government 
appealed an order to release 74 photographs and three videotapes of abuse at Abu 
Ghraib, claiming that releasing the images would result in widespread violence. 
The government withdrew its first appeal when most of those images were 
published on Salon.com without causing violence.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Amrit Singh, the ACLU attorney who argued the case before the court today, 
said the government is attempting to radically expand the exemptions allowed 
under the Freedom of Information Act for withholding records.</P>
<P>&#8220;Under the government&#8217;s logic, records that uncover the most egregious 
government misconduct would be afforded the greatest protection from disclosure 
under the Freedom of Information Act. That cannot be,&#8221; said Singh. &#8220;These images 
shed light not only on the scope of prisoner abuse by U.S. forces, but also on 
command responsibility for that abuse. The public has a right to examine these 
images for itself.&#8221;</P>
<P>The government agrees that the final ruling on appeal with respect to the 21 
images will also apply to other images of prisoner abuse that it is withholding 
on the same grounds. So far, the government has identified approximately 23 such 
images of prisoner abuse.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Several organizations and legal experts have filed briefs with the Second 
Circuit Court of Appeals supporting the release of the abuse images, including 
22 professors of the law of armed conflict, the National Security Archives, the 
New York City Bar Association, the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press 
and more than a dozen media organizations. Some of the briefs note that the 
United States itself pioneered the use of photographs of prisoners to strengthen 
international human rights, and images of abuse led to the ratification of the 
Geneva Conventions.</P>
<P>To date, more than 100,000 pages of government documents have been released 
in response to the ACLU's Freedom of Information Act lawsuit. The ACLU has been 
posting these documents online at <A class=noline_blue href="http://www.aclu.org/torturefoia">www.aclu.org/torturefoia</A>.</P>
<P>In a related case, the ACLU and Human Rights First represent nine men 
subjected to torture and abuse in Iraq and Afghanistan. That lawsuit charges 
that then-Defense Secretary Rumsfeld bears direct responsibility for the torture 
and abuse of detainees. A federal court hearing is scheduled in that case on 
December 8 in Washington, D.C.. For more information, go to <A class=noline_blue href="http://www.aclu.org/rumsfeld">www.aclu.org/rumsfeld</A>. </P>
<P>On November 28, the ACLU will appear at a federal hearing in Richmond, VA in 
the case of Khaled El-Masri, an innocent German man who was kidnapped by the CIA 
and transported to a secret site in Afghanistan where he was detained and 
abused. A district court upheld the CIA&#8217;s claim that the case could not proceed 
without disclosing state secrets. The ACLU appealed the decision, noting that 
accounts of El-Masri&#8217;s abduction have already appeared in news reports around 
the world and foreign governments have launched their own investigations into 
the matter. For more information go to <A class=noline_blue href="http://www.aclu.org/rendition">www.aclu.org/rendition</A>.</P>
<P>Attorneys in the FOIA case are Lawrence Lustberg and Melanca Clark of the New 
Jersey-based law firm Gibbons, Del Deo, Dolan, Griffinger &amp; Vecchione, P.C.; 
Jameel Jaffer, Singh and Judy Rabinovitz of the ACLU; Arthur Eisenberg and 
Beth Haroules of the NYCLU; and Bill Goodman and Michael Ratner of the Center 
for Constitutional Rights.</P>
<P>Legal documents filed in today&#8217;s case, including friend-of-the-court briefs, 
are online at: <A class=noline_blue href="http://www.aclu.org/torturefoia/legaldocuments/index.html">www.aclu.org/torturefoia/legaldocuments/index.html</A>.
