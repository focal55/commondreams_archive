<p>MARMANDE, France - July 27 - Early this morning a group of Greenpeace 
activists entered a GE maize field in Grezet Cavagnan, Southern France 
and carved a giant "crop circle" with an "X" in the GE maize, marking 
the field as a contamination zone. The action was in response to a 
ruling by a French court yesterday, in which Greenpeace France was 
ordered to take down maps from its Web site that showed the location of 
commercial GE maize fields in France.

<p>The field that the activists 'crop circled' today was one of the two GE 
maize fields highlighted on the censored Web page. "As we are now 
forbidden to publish these maps of GE maize on our webpage, we have gone 
into the fields and marked it for real," said Arnaud Apoteker, of 
Greenpeace France. "We will continue to show where GE maize is grown, 
until the French Government fulfils its responsibility and publishes an 
official register of GE fields that is accessible to every citizen."

<p>The EU legislation (Directive 2001/18) that deals with GE organisms 
shows how EU member states are obliged to maintain public registers in 
order to inform their citizens about the locations of GE fields. But the 
French Government has yet to make the EU's directive into national law, 
thus depriving its citizens of vital information to protect against the 
risk of GE contamination of conventional and organic food.

<p>"By publishing secret locations of fields of genetically engineered 
maize, Greenpeace is defending the right to know and say no to the 
environmental and health risks associated with GE Organisms", said Geert 
Ritsema of Greenpeace International. "It is absurd that the French legal 
system has prevented Greenpeace France from providing vital information 
to the public, which according to EU legislation should have been 
published years ago by the French government."

<p>Internationally, Greenpeace will continue to expose the locations of GE 
fields. Although the map showing the French GE maize fields has had to 
be removed from Greenpeace Frances' Web site it is now available at: 
<a href="http://www.greenpeace.org" target="_new">www.greenpeace.org</a>  The map will also be distributed virally via email 
and in doing so be available to millions of people around the world. The 
action today marks the beginning of a global campaign to inform the 
public about the risks of GE maize cultivation for the environment and 
to human health.

<p>France is not the only EU country where the growing of GE organisms is 
shrouded in secrecy.  In Spain, the government has so far refused to 
publish the locations of GE fields. The dramatic consequences of this 
policy became clear in April of this year when Greenpeace published a 
report 'Impossible Coexistence' showing that in nearly 20 % of the 
investigated cases, neighbouring conventional and organic maize fields 
in Spain are contaminated by GE organisms, without farmers and consumers 
even knowing about it. (2)

<p>Greenpeace campaigns for GE-free crop and food production that is 
grounded in the principles of sustainability, protection of biodiversity 
and providing all people to have access to safe and nutritious food. 
Genetic engineering is an unnecessary and unwanted technology that 
contaminates the environment, threatens biodiversity and poses 
unacceptable risks to health.
