<p>WASHINGTON - February 6 - <font size=2 face=Arial><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>A recently unsealed indictment handed down
by a federal grand jury in Miami, Florida, adds a Colombian terrorist
organization to the growing list of terror entities that have chosen the 50
caliber anti-armor sniper rifle as a favorite weapon, the Violence Policy
Center (VPC) warned today.&nbsp; The indictment was returned on January 3,
2006, and unsealed on January 26, 2006.&nbsp; It charges 10 foreign nationals
with a variety of offenses, including attempting to provide material support to
a foreign terrorist organization--the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia,
or FARC.<o:p></o:p></span></font><font size=2 face=Arial><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial'><o:p></o:p></span></font>
<p class=MsoNormal><font size=2 face=Arial><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>According to the 17-count indictment, the defendants offered
to help persons they believed to be members of FARC buy fifty 50
calibers.&nbsp; Accurate to over a mile, 50 caliber sniper rifles can penetrate
armor plating and destroy aircraft, but are sold with fewer federal controls
than a standard handgun.<o:p></o:p></span></font><font size=2 face=Arial><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal><font size=2 face=Arial><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>A 2001 VPC study, &quot;Voting From the Rooftops,&quot;
revealed how Al Qaeda, Osama bin Laden's terror network, purchased at least
twenty-five 50 caliber anti-armor sniper rifles in the <st1:country-region
w:st="on">U.S.</st1:country-region> during the 1980s, and that an unknown
number of the guns were also purchased in the <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">U.S.</st1:place></st1:country-region> by the terrorist Irish
Republican Army.&nbsp; A number of domestic terror and fringe organizations
have also purchased the guns in varying quantities.&nbsp; [For VPC studies on
these deadly rifles, as well as their use by criminals and terrorists, please
see <a href="http://www.vpc.org/50caliber.htm">http://www.vpc.org/50caliber.htm</a>.]<o:p></o:p></span></font><font size=2 face=Arial><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal><font size=2 face=Arial><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>The July 2005 VPC report &quot;Clear and Present
Danger:&nbsp; National Security Experts Warn About the Danger of Unrestricted
Sales of 50 Caliber Anti-Armor Sniper Rifles to Civilians&quot; documented
national security officials&#8217; concerns about the destructive capabilities
of these military bred weapons.&nbsp; The study revealed the details of a
report authored by a senior U.S. Secret Service official, previously classified
as &quot;Secret,&quot; warning that large caliber sniper rifles posed a threat
to the President, other senior government officials, and to civil aviation. <o:p></o:p></span></font><font size=2 face=Arial><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial'><o:p></o:p></span></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><font size=2 face=Arial><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>&#8220;Terrorists love these rifles because they are ideal
tools for terror,&#8221; said Tom Diaz, VPC senior policy analyst and author of
the VPC reports.&nbsp; &#8220;They come to the <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:country-region
 w:st="on">United States</st1:country-region></st1:place> to buy them because
our laws are so weak and so laxly enforced that anyone with a credit card and a
believable ID can outfit an army with such incredibly destructive weapons of
war as the 50 caliber anti-armor sniper rifle.&#8221;<o:p></o:p></span></font><font size=2 face=Arial><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial'><o:p></o:p></span></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><font size=2 face=Arial><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>Diaz noted that the current indictment soundly refutes the
gun industry and its apologists who continue to insist, in the face of mounting
evidence to the contrary, that the rifles are of interest only to sportsmen and
collectors, not to terrorists.</span></font></p>
