<p>WASHINGTON - May 9 - As Kentuckians prepare to vote in the May 16 primary elections, a new state poll shows that 78 percent of Kentucky voters believe they would benefit from a nonpartisan voter’s guide that provides basic information and statements of qualifications directly from judicial candidates. A majority of voters also reported they did not have enough information about judicial candidates the last time they went to vote for judge. 

<p>The results underscore the value of a new, nonpartisan website being launched today, kyjudges.com, which aims to get vital information into the hands of Kentucky voters before they cast ballots in the May 16 primary election. The website is sponsored by Justice at Stake and Common Cause of Kentucky, two groups that aim to promote public confidence in a fair and impartial court system. The site contains information supplied directly by the candidates, as well as basic information about how the courts operate in Kentucky.

<p>"Voters often find it difficult to make the right choice for judge, because they so often lack even basic information about the candidates," said Bert Brandenburg, executive director of Justice at Stake. "This new website helps close that information gap."

<p>Justice at Stake also announced today that it is sponsoring a televised Public Service Announcement (PSA) to make Kentucky voters more aware of the online voter guide. The PSA will be airing on broadcast television stations in the Lexington and Louisville markets beginning today. The PSA can be viewed online at kyjudges.com.

<p>Brandenburg added that nonpartisan voter guides are becoming popular in more states as an effective means to combat special interest campaigns in judicial elections.

<p>The Justice at Stake and Common Cause of Kentucky poll indicates that worries persist about the role of outside influences in Kentucky’s judicial contests, with 71 percent being at least somewhat concerned that efforts of special interest groups to pressure judicial candidates will undermine the fairness and impartiality of Kentucky courts. When asked, an overwhelming majority of Kentucky voters indicate they want courts that are accountable to the law and the Constitution (83 percent), not politicians or special interests (4 percent). The poll of 411 Kentucky likely voters was completed by TSG of Chicago, Illinois, on May 3-4, 2006, and has a margin of error of 4.8 percent. Complete poll results are online at www.kyjudges.com.

<p>"This poll confirms that Kentuckians are concerned when judicial candidates must raise money for big-time campaigns, and they don’t like the idea that special interests may try to put justice up for sale," said Richard Beliles, Chairman of Common Cause of Kentucky.

<p>Common Cause of Kentucky promotes good citizenship, and advocates for open, honest, and accessible state and local government. The Justice at Stake Campaign, based in Washington, DC, is a national nonpartisan partnership that works to protect fair, impartial and independent courts. Justice at Stake partners educate the public and work for reforms to keep politics and special interests out of the courtroom—so judges can do their job protecting the Constitution, individual rights and the rule of law. More information about the organizations is available online at justiceatstake.org and commoncause.org.

<p>Interested citizens from across Kentucky have also formed a Judicial Campaign Conduct Committee, an independent, non-profit, non-partisan entity created to educate the public about the important difference between judicial campaigns and those for partisan, political office, and about the high standards expected in judicial campaigns. Such committees have proved successful in other states around the country in helping candidates conduct effective campaigns in an ethical and dignified manner. The committee is chaired by Lexington attorney Spencer Noe.
