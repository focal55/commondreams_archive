<p>SAN FRANCISCO - 

August 15 - leads the nation with the greatest disparity of high-cost  home purchase loans to minorities, followed by San Francisco, and  Los Angeles. About three fourths of all sub prime home loans are  adjustable rate mortgages (ARMs), which, the study points out,  will be much harder for borrowers to repay as interest rates  rise. Five California cities are among the top 10 where  homebuyers in neighborhoods were at least four times more likely  to receive a high-cost loan than homebuyers in predominately  white neighborhoods.</p>
<p>   On Tuesday, August 15, the national community group ACORN will  release &quot;The Impending Rate Shock: A study of home mortgages in  130 American Cities.&quot;</p>
<p>   Using data available under the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act,  ACORN's study examines the extent of high-cost (sub prime)  lending in 130 metropolitan areas and the disparities between  borrowers of different race and income levels. The report will  identify the metropolitan areas and demographic groups that are  at a greatest risk of &quot;rate shock&quot; and a sharp increase in  foreclosures.</p>
<p>   National foreclosures are up by as much as 60 percent over a  year ago, and experts expect the default-loan trends to continue.</p>
<p>   Members of the media can obtain an embargoed copy of the  study, including local data, beginning on Friday, August 11 by  visiting <a href="http://releases.usnewswire.com/redir.asp?ReleaseID=70716&Link=http://www.acorn.org/reporters">http://www.acorn.org/reporters</a>.</p>
