<p>WASHINGTON - May 26 - The Federal Communications Commission has launched an  
investigation of dozens of television stations, for airing corporate- 
sponsored and -scripted segments on news programs, without disclosing  
their sources.

<p>The investigation comes in response to an investigative report by the  
Center for Media and Democracy (CMD) and an online activist campaign  
spearheaded by Free Press. The official probe by FCC Chairman Kevin  
Martin was reported today by Bloomberg News.

<p>The report, titled "Fake TV News: Widespread and Undisclosed,"  
identified 77 television stations across the country that aired  
corporate PR as news over a 10-month period. Not one station  
disclosed the clients behind these segments to its viewers.

<p>"We commend the FCC for taking the issue of fake news seriously,"  
said Diane Farsetta, the Center for Media and Democracy's senior  
researcher and the co-author of the report. "With the FCC's  
enforcement bureau getting involved, hopefully TV stations will  
finally practice full disclosure."

<p>Although CMD tracked just 36 of the thousands of video news releases,  
or VNRs, distributed each year, it identified 69 TV stations that  
aired at least one VNR. Eight other stations aired satellite media  
tours, which are live but highly scripted interviews often scheduled  
and aired in conjunction with VNRs. The list of TV stations, along  
with footage of the VNRs and the newscasts that showed them, can be  
found at www.prwatch.org/fakenews/execsummary.

<p>In conjunction with the release of the report on April 6, 2006, Free  
Press launched a "No Fake News" online activist campaign. Since then,  
more than 25,000 concerned citizens have contacted the FCC to urge  
the agency to enforce and strengthen its disclosure requirements.

<p>"The FCC should be applauded for listening to its real constituents  
-- the American public," said Craig Aaron, communications director of  
Free Press. "The official FCC probe puts the nation's biggest media  
companies on notice that their viewers won't stand for fake news on  
the public airwaves. We hope the FCC will back up its strong  
statements on covert propaganda with decisive action."

<p>In its April 2005 Public Notice, the FCC stated, "Whenever broadcast  
stations and cable operators air VNRs, licensees and operators  
generally must disclose to members of their audiences the nature,  
source and sponsorship of the material." The FCC declined to comment  
on today's report about the investigation.

<p>CMD and Free Press also filed a formal complaint with the FCC last  
month, urging that all VNRs be accompanied by a continuous, frame-by- 
frame visual notification and verbal disclosure of their source. The  
complaint is available at <a href="www.freepress.net/docs/%20fcc_complaint_4-06-06.pdf">www.freepress.net/docs/ 
fcc_complaint_4-06-06.pdf</a>.
