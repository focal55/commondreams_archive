<p>WASHINGTON - May 26 - Details of Wal-Mart's "New Plan" undermine Wal-Mart's previous health care announcement.</p>
<p>   Documents expose Wal-Mart's secret plan to cut workers' hours, shift to a majority part-time workforce, and cut benefits for full-time workers "transitioned" to part-time.</p>
<p>   Today, WakeUpWalMart.com, America's campaign to change Wal-Mart, released copies of Wal-Mart's new health care benefits plan for  current part-time employees and full-time employees "transitioned"  to part-time.  The health care documents were given to the group by  Wal-Mart employees concerned about the terrible effects that Wal- Mart's new policies, in particular the drastic transition from full- time to part-time, are having on employee morale, customer service  and store performance.</p>
<p>   The first document, a 7-page booklet, titled "My Benefits: New  Peak Time Benefits: Making a Difference for You," details the  specific changes to Wal-Mart's health care benefits which the  company announced last month.  The second document is a memo from  Wal-Mart's "administrative committee" to all "full and peak-time  hourly associates," titled a "Summary of Material Modifications to  Associates' Health and Welfare Plan."</p>
<p>   Both documents were given to employees as part of a special  enrollment period which runs from May 15 through May 26, 2006.  The  special enrollment period, however, is not open to all Wal-Mart  associates.  Only associates who are part-time and have more than 1  year of service but less than 2 years of service (part-timers with  more than 2 years of service are only eligible if they enroll their  dependent) and full-time employees who were just 'transitioned' to  part-time status, are eligible to enroll.</p>
<p>   "Based on these new documents, either Wal-Mart falsely claimed it  would offer its low cost plan to 50 percent of its Associates, or  Wal-Mart has 'transitioned' many more workers to part-time than has  been reported publicly.  Either way, Wal-Mart's rhetoric doesn't  match reality, and Wal-Mart workers are paying way too high a  price," said Paul Blank, campaign director for WakeUpWalMart.com.</p>
<p>   Based on the two documents, it is obvious Wal-Mart's "new health  care changes" will do little to expand health care coverage for many  of its 1.3 million employees.  Rather, Wal-Mart's health care  changes are clearly structured to cut health care costs and minimize  the public relations disaster from slashing over 200,000 full-time  jobs and replacing or transitioning them with low paid part-time  workers.</p>
<p>   According to a JP Morgan report issued in January 2006, as well  as the infamous internal health care memo authored by Wal-Mart  Executive Vice President Susan Chambers, Wal-Mart publicly states it  intends to shift hundreds of thousands of full-time workers to part- time status.  In the two health care documents, Wal-Mart coldly  refers to this shift as a "transition" and now describes part-time  workers as "peak-time" employees.</p>
<p>   Under the new health care changes, all 'transitioned' employees  lose most of their benefits, including dental, life insurance and  disability immediately, and will lose their health care benefit  after one year.  In addition, part-time Associates are unable to  enroll their spouses.  The lack of spousal coverage is consistent  with Wal-Mart's desire to cut health care costs by decreasing  spousal coverage.  As Chambers states in the memo, "spouses are by  far the most expensive plan members to cover."</p>
<p>   Unfortunately, Wal-Mart's new health care plans continue to  remain unaffordable for the average Wal-Mart employee.  Wal-Mart's  most affordable health care option, the Value Plan, has a $3,000  deductible for family coverage and several other deductibles for  prescription drug coverage and hospital procedures.  Based on all of  the premiums and deductibles in the so-called 'Value' plan, a part- time Wal-Mart employee could have to pay up to 58 percent of his/her  salary for an individual plan and up to 93 percent for family  coverage.</p>
<p>   Most disturbingly, newly transitioned employees who take  advantage of this special enrollment will lose any money they have  already spent on their deductible and will once again have to pay  the full $3,000 deductible.</p>
<p>   "For the sake of Wal-Mart's workers, their families, and the  American taxpayer, we call on Lee Scott and Wal-Mart to propose real  health care changes that don't dangerously discriminate against  single, uninsured part-time workers and exclude health care coverage  for spouses.  Wal-Mart's plan to expand health care coverage to  employees while making it more unaffordable through lower pay and  less hours is deceptive and a national disgrace," added Blank.</p>
