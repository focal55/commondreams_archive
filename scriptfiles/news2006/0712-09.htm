<p>WASHINGTON - July 12 - In less than two weeks, activists, members and supporters will be heading to Albany, New York for NOW's National Conference and Young Feminist Summit, to celebrate a momentous milestone: The National Organization for Women's 40th Anniversary.

<p>The conference begins July 21 and wraps up on July 23, and will highlight and honor our founders and past presidents including Betty Friedan, who passed away earlier this year. During this three-day event, we will recognize the invaluable contributions of the exceptional women and men to the organization and the advancement of women's rights. Special guests and speakers will inform and inspire the participants, as well as help us celebrate our big bash. 

<p>The conference is just one of many celebrations throughout the coming year, beginning with NOW's birthday on June 30, 2006. At this empowering and motivating event, we will also be planning our strategy and priorities for the coming year. Our celebration will continue when we gather to honor courageous women at our annual Intrepid Awards Gala on September 14, in Washington, D.C.
