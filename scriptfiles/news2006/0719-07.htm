<p><b>BACKGROUND:</b> Within just seven years since its public introduction in 1992, Falun Gong spread by word-of-mouth to 100 million people, who experienced firsthand its health and spiritual benefits. Despite its popularity, led by the former leader Jiang Zemin on July 20, 1999, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) initiated a nationwide campaign to ruthlessly persecute Falun Gong and to turn public opinion against this peaceful, spiritual practice, which is based on truthfulness, compassion and tolerance. Appeals for justice by Falun Gong practitioners and supporters worldwide have been interfered with by the CCP's use of espionage, harassment and terrorism. In these seven years of persecution, many people have awakened to the evilness of the CCP's tactics, yet the CCP has only intensified its persecution on Falun Gong practitioners through brainwashing, psychiatric abuse, torture, murder and even harvesting the organs from live Falun Gong practitioners. Please join Falun Gong in support of freedom, justice and the end of this persecution.
