<p>CURITIBA, Brazil - March 24 - A broad coalition of peasant farmers, 
indigenous peoples and civil society today celebrated the firm rejection 
of efforts to undermine the global moratorium on Terminator technologies 
- genetically engineered sterile seeds - at the UN Convention on 
Biological Diversity (CBD) in Curitiba, Brazil.
 
<p>"This is a momentous day for the 1.4 billion poor people worldwide, who 
depend on farmer saved seeds," said Francisca Rodriguez of Via 
Campesina, a world wide movement of peasant farmers, "Terminator seeds 
are a weapon of mass destruction and an assault on our food sovereignty."
 
<p>"Terminator directly threatens our life, our culture and our identity as 
indigenous peoples", said Viviana Figueroa of the Ocumazo indigenous 
community in Argentina, on behalf of the International Indigenous Forum 
on Biodiversity.
 
<p>"Today's decision is a huge step forward for the Brazilian Campaign 
against GMOs," said Maria Rita Reis from the Brazilian Forum of Social 
movements and NGOs, "This reaffirms Brazil's existing ban on Terminator. 
It sends a clear  message to the national government and congress that 
the world supports a ban on Terminator."
 
<p>"Common sense has prevailed - lifting the Moratorium on the Terminator 
seeds would have been suicidal - literally," said Greenpeace 
International's Benedikt Haerlin from the Convention meeting. "This is a 
genuine victory for civil society around the world - it will go a long 
way to ensuring that biodiversity, food security and the livelihoods of 
millions of farmers worldwide are protected."

<p>Terminators, or GURTS (Genetic Use Restriction Technologies), are a 
class of genetic engineering technologies which allow companies to 
introduce seeds whose sterile offspring cannot reproduce, preventing 
farmers from re-planting seeds from their harvest. The seeds could also 
be used to introduce specific traits which would only be triggered by 
the application of proprietary chemicals by the same companies.

<p>At the CBD Australia, Canada and New Zealand along with the US 
government (not a party to the CBD) and a number of biotech companies 
were leading attempts to open the door to field testing of Terminator 
seeds by insisting on a 'case by case' assessment of such technologies.  
This text was unanimously rejected today in the CBD's working group 
dealing with the issue and still needs to be formally adopted by the 
plenary of the CBD.

<p>"Despite today's victory, there is no doubt that the multinational 
biotech industry will continue to push sterile seed technology," said 
Pat Mooney of the Ban Terminator Campaign.  "Terminator will rear its 
ugly head at the next UN CBD meeting in 2008. The only solution is a 
total ban on the technology once and for all," he concluded.

<p>Greenpeace is an independent, campaigning organisation which uses 
non-violent, creative confrontation to expose global environmental 
problems, and to force solutions essential to a green and peaceful future.
