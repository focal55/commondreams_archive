<p>WASHINGTON - July 4 - 

<p><a href="mailto:johnross@igc.org"><b>JOHN ROSS</b><br>
</a>A U.S. journalist currently in Mexico City, Ross is author of the 
book "Mexico in Focus: A Guide to the People, Politics, and Culture."

<p><b><a href="mailto:nmartinez@seen.org">NADIA MARTINEZ</a></b>,  <a href="http://www.ips-dc.org" target="_new">http://www.ips-dc.org</a><br>

    Policy analyst for Institute for Policy Studies, Martinez said 
today: "While it isn't yet clear who will be Mexico's next president, 
the overwhelming support garnered by Lopez Obrador is a clear sign that 
large numbers of Mexicans, like Latin Americans generally, want 
significant change in the direction of their country."

<p><b><a href="mailto:ccollins@faireconomy.org">CHUCK COLLINS</a></b><br>

    Senior scholar with the Institute for Policy Studies, Collins lives 
in Oaxaca, Mexico and is covering the Mexican elections. Martinez and 
Collins co-wrote a piece <a href="http://www.dfw.com/mld/dfw/news/opinion/14947097.htm" target="_new">"Winner Will Make Big Difference North Of The Border,"</a>
 which was published by the Fort Worth Star-Telegram. He just wrote a 
piece <a href="http://alternet.org/story/38461" target="_new">"Mexican Election in Limbo."</a> 

<p><b><a href="mailto:weisbrot@cepr.net">MARK WEISBROT</a></b><br>

    Weisbrot is co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy 
Research and has written extensively on Latin America. His up-to-date 
backgrounder on economic issues in the Mexican election is available as 
a <a href="http://www.cepr.net/publications/mexico_background_2006_06.pdf" target="_new">PDF</a>.
    A recent column, "Mexico: Their Brand is Crisis," is at <a href="http://www.commondreams.org/views06/0701-27.htm" target="_new">http://www.commondreams.org/views06/0701-27.htm</a>.
    Weisbrot said today: "It's pretty clear that Mexico needs to 
reconsider its economic policies. Over the 25 years since 1980, income 
per person in Mexico has grown by just 17 percent. To see how bad this 
is, one need only look at the 20 years from 1960-1980, when the 
country's per capita income grew by 99 percent. If the Mexican economy 
had simply continued to grow at its pre-1980 rate, average income in 
Mexico would be at the level of Spain today. There would be far fewer 
Mexicans looking to emigrate illegally to the United States."

<p><b>CINDY SHEEHAN, DIANE WILSON, via <a href="mailto:meredith@globalexchange.org">Meredith Dearborn</a></b><br>

    A host of activists today are launching the "Troops Home Fast" -- 
they will be fasting and organizing events across from the White House 
until mid-August. A schedule of events today and for the next month is 
available <a href="http://www.TroopsHomeFast.org/article.php?id=1040" target="_new">here</a>.
   Sheehan is the mother of Spc. Casey Sheehan who was killed in action 
in Iraq on 04/04/04. She is co-founder and president of Gold Star 
Families for Peace and author of the books "Not One More Mother's Child" 
and "Dear President Bush." Her latest article is "Bombs Bursting in 
Air," see: <a href="http://www.buzzflash.com/contributors/06/07/con06285.html" target="_new">http://www.buzzflash.com/contributors/06/07/con06285.html</a>.
    Wilson is an activist and author of the book "An Unreasonable 
Woman." She said today: "Iraqi lives are on the line every day. And so 
are the bodies of the U.S. soldiers. So shouldn't we be putting our 
bodies on the line? Shouldn't we be as serious about making peace as 
some people are about making war?" Other notables engaging in the fast 
will include Dick Gregory and Daniel Ellsberg.

<p><b><a href="mailto:arun@totalnonviolence.org">ARUN GANDHI</a></b>, <a href="http://www.GandhiInstitute.org" target="_new">http://www.GandhiInstitute.org</a><br>

    Co-founder (with his wife, Sunanda Gandhi) of the M.K. Gandhi 
Institute for Nonviolence, Arun Gandhi lived with his grandfather 
Mahatma Gandhi from 1946 until his assassination in 1948. He said today: 
"This fast is one form of protest against the war. I cannot be there 
with them in Washington, D.C., but I want to morally support them." Arun 
Gandhi's books include "Legacy of Love: My Education in the Path of 
Nonviolence."
