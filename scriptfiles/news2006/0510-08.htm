<p>WASHINGTON - May 10 - World Wildlife Fund  (WWF) announced today that it is working with the leading  producers of farmed seafood including catfish, tilapia, basa,  abalone, oysters, clams, scallops and mussels to improve the  industry's environmental performance. Separate discussions are  underway -- called &quot;aquaculture dialogues&quot; -- for tilapia,  catfish and molluscs.  All are focused on developing credible and  measurable standards that could be used in investment and buyer  screens or a certification program to reduce or eliminate the key  impacts of the aquaculture industry.    </p>
<p>   &quot;This effort comes at a critical time.  Aquaculture now  accounts for nearly half of the seafood we eat and the industry  is booming,&quot; said Carter Roberts, president and CEO of World  Wildlife Fund.  &quot;As the industry has grown, so has its impact on  the environment.  We are strongly encouraged by the eagerness of  some of the biggest names in aquaculture to join us in improving  their industry.&quot;</p>
<p>   The dialogues build on the previous multi-stakeholder  standards, setting work of WWF as part of the Consortium on  Shrimp Farming and the Environment with the FAO, World Bank and  Network of Aquaculture Centres in Asia Pacific.  The Consortium  developed principles and criteria for sustainable shrimp farming  that were broadly supported by producers, NGOs, governments, and  other stakeholders around the globe. Draft standards based on  these principles and criteria are currently being field tested in  Madagascar, Belize and Vietnam. WWF also plans to initiate  aquaculture dialogues on trout and seaweed.</p>
<p>   The threats from aquaculture include pollution of coastal  waters with nutrient-rich effluent, over use of wild-caught fish  for aquaculture feeds, transformation of ecologically sensitive  areas, and disease and parasite transfer from cultured to wild  fish.  The dialogues focus on identifying and analyzing the major  impacts of each aquaculture production system and developing  acceptable, quantitative performance levels that will show  measurable improvement. </p>
<p>   &quot;The producers involved in the recently formed Tilapia  Aquaculture Dialogue are some of the most efficient in the world,  and now together with other stakeholders we are promoting the  adoption of the better practices we have developed over the  years,&quot; said Alfonso Delfini, E. with Aquamar, S.A., one of 10  tilapia producers involved and a member of the dialogue's  steering committee. The committee also includes Mike Picchietti  of Regal Springs; William Marshall of Rain Forest Aquaculture;  Dr. Michael Tlusty of New England Aquarium; and Dr. Aaron McNevin  of World Wildlife Fund. </p>
<p>   &quot;The Aquaculture Dialogues are the only standard development  processes out there that have a balanced mix of  environmentalists, industry leaders, researchers, buyers, allied  businesses, governments, investors, and development agencies  working collectively to develop these performance-based  standards,&quot; said Dr. Aaron McNevin, aquaculture specialist at  World Wildlife Fund.   </p>
<p>   As wild stocks of fish and other seafood populations have  declined, aquaculture has grown to be a multi-billion dollar  industry.  Increasingly, retailers are looking for aquaculture  products that meet broadly accepted standards for sustainability.  </p>
<p>   &quot;We appreciate World Wildlife Fund's inclusive approach to  develop solid, measurable, industry-wide aquaculture standards.  This process paired with their expertise and knowledge of the key  issues makes for a great combination when it comes to being  informed on issues and getting all perspectives,&quot; said Margaret  Wittenberg, vice president of communications and quality  standards at Whole Foods Market, Inc.  &quot;The real benefit for a  conscious retailer is the credibility that WWF and this  initiative will bring to the marketplace.&quot;</p>
