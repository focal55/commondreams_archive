<p> WASHINGTON - December 29 - 
The Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ), a White House office that develops and coordinates federal environmental policy, has partially responded to a May 12, 2006 Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request by Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) that sought documents relating to records of communications between CEQ officials and members of the government or external advocacy groups on the issue of climate change. The full archive can be viewed by clicking on the campaign link at the top left.<br />
<br />
 The CEQ documents include communications with former CEQ chief of staff Philip Cooney and his staff with the American Enterprise Institute (AEI) and other nongovernmental entities regarding the Kyoto protocol, a lawsuit filed against CEQ during the Clinton Administration, as well as internal emails and various climate change reports. <br />
<br />
CREW will post additional CEQ documents as they are received. CREW is posting these records as part of its commitment to holding the government responsible to its actions. </p>
