WASHINGTON - July 7 - 

Though rarely featured in recent news coverage, Israeli critics of the 
Gaza attacks are speaking out loudly.

<p><b><a href="mailto:reinhart@post.tau.ac.il">TANYA REINHART</a></b>, <a href="http://www.tau.ac.il/%7Ereinhart" target="_new">http://www.tau.ac.il/~reinhart</a><br>

    Professor emeritus at Tel Aviv University, Reinhart is author of the 
forthcoming book "The Road Map to Nowhere: Israel/Palestine Since 2003."
<p>She said today: "The present Israeli 'operation' is not about 
releasing the captured Israeli soldier -- one need not be a military 
analyst to realize he cannot be released this way. The Israeli army has 
been planning this operation for quite a while, awaiting the appropriate 
trigger that will create the appropriate international conditions.
<p>"The major goal of the Israeli government is toppling the Hamas 
government by force. In Israel's view, the Palestinian election results 
are a disaster, because for the first time they have a leadership that 
insists on representing Palestinian interests rather than just 
collaborating with Israel's demands.
<p>"A second local goal is to turn the north of the Gaza Strip into a 
'no man's land.' This plan has been openly discussed in Israeli media 
since the disengagement last summer." Reinhart is a columnist for the 
Israeli paper Yediot Aharonot and author of the book "Israel/Palestine: 
How to End the War of 1948."

    Avnery is founder of Gush-Shalom, the Israeli "Peace Bloc." He said 
today: "The offensive on land, from the sea and from the air does not 
put an end to the launching of Qassam rockets. It is leading to their 
increase. The sowing of destruction in the Gaza Strip does not bring 
Gilad Shalit home. It is endangering his life." Avnery has been a member 
of the Knesset and as a youth was a member of the Irgun, a rightwing 
Zionist paramilitary.

<p><b><a href="mailto:menuchin@gmail.com">YISHAI MENUCHIN</a></b>, <a href="http://www.yeshgvul.org" target="_new">http://www.yeshgvul.org</a><br>

    Menuchin is a spokesman for the Israeli peace group Yesh Gvul, which 
educates soldiers and the public about Israeli violations of 
international law. Yesh Gvul activists were among the hundreds of 
protesters in front of Prime Minister Ehud Olmert's house on July 1. 
Menuchin said: "We call for our government to stop targeting Palestinian 
civilians -- the targeting of civilians is a war crime -- and start 
negotiating with the elected Palestinian leaders, not to arrest them." 
Yesh Gvul will be releasing the book "Occupation and Refusal" this month.
