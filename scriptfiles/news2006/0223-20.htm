<p>BOSTON  - February 23 - Six months after  Hurricane Katrina slammed into the Gulf Coast and displacing more  than 800,000 people from their homes, state and federal agencies  are continuing to neglect poor communities, according to,  &quot;Recovering States: The Gulf Coast Six Months After the Storm,&quot; a  report which will be released next week by international aid  agency Oxfam America.    </p>
<p>   &quot;Despite critical reports and investigative hearings of  government failures, despite the flurry of commitments to  confront poverty in the U.S. -- six months after Katrina, little  has changed,&quot; said Minor Sinclair, director of Oxfam America's  Regional Office.  &quot;It's unconscionable that the same vulnerable  people abandoned in the height of the storm could again be  neglected in the recovery. There are still thousands of people  who don't have a place to live and don't have answers to the most  basic questions about their futures in the Gulf Coast.&quot;</p>
<p>   Oxfam's aims in the Gulf Coast since Katrina and Rita have  been to empower poor communities that have been most deeply  affected by the storms.  &quot;Recovering States,&quot; examines current  conditions, and long-term implications, for lower income families  whose vulnerabilities were laid bare by Hurricane Katrina.   Several key elements of the report analyze statistics related to  the number of still displaced people, endemic poverty rates in  Louisiana and Mississippi, and the repercussions of states'  proposed plans for federal funds.  As part of its advocacy for  the most vulnerable groups, Oxfam devotes a section to the large  but often overlooked group of renters, who may be completely  bypassed by federal funding earmarked for Katrina recovery.   </p>
<p>   Since Hurricane Katrina struck on Aug. 29, 2005, Oxfam America  has been an active participant and advocate in providing relief  and recovery to lower income families overlooked by federal  agencies.  Oxfam is partnering with 16 local community  organizations such as the NAACP, Louisiana Environmental Action  Network, and Mississippi Immigrants Rights Alliance (MIRA), to  provide assistance to vulnerable groups.</p>
<p>   On Feb. 16, President Bush submitted a request to Congress for  an additional $19.8 billion for rebuilding the Gulf Coast,  including an additional $4.2 billon in Community Development  Block Grant funding, which Oxfam calls, &quot;a major step toward  reconstruction of the Gulf Coast,&quot; but advises, &quot;by no means  should it be the last step.&quot;  </p>
<p>   &quot;We welcome this additional request for funds and urge  Congress to respond quickly,&quot; said Ashley Tsongas, advocacy  coordinator for Oxfam's Hurricane Recovery. &quot;However, these funds  must be allocated so they also meet the urgent housing needs of  the poorest and most vulnerable hurricane survivors. Funds  earmarked for FEMA should instead be directed to HUD, a federal  agency with proven affordable housing expertise.&quot; </p>
<p>   A portion of the $85 billion for relief and recovery in the  Gulf Coast that has already been approved by Congress is  dedicated to Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) funding  designed to assist low and moderate income communities with  decent housing, expanded economic opportunities, and quality of  life improvements.  Although $11.5 billion has been already been  appropriated for CDBG programs in the Gulf Coast and an  additional $4.2 billion is waiting to be approved, regulations  which govern the use of these funds have been loosened and the  drafts of state housing recovery plans focus on a narrowly  defined group of homeowners.  As a result, the lowest income  groups stand to lose this important part of the recovery package.  </p>
<p>   &quot;It is time to make good on the nation's promises,&quot; Sinclair  said.  &quot;More funds for affordable housing must be made available  immediately, through the new money that must be approved by  Congress and through state plans that target the lowest income  communities. This is the critical first step to a long road to  recovery that builds back better, through federal support of  local initiatives.&quot;</p>
