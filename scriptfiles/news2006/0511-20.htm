<p>WASHINGTON - May 11 - History was made today in Houston when more than 25.8% percent of ConocoPhillips shareholders voted in favor of a resolution asking the company to recognize – and eventually stay out  of - sensitive areas within the National Petroleum Reserve Alaska, particularly areas near Teshekpuk Lake.  The resolution, filed by Green Century Capital Management as part of the U.S. PIRG Education Fund's Arctic Wilderness Campaign, was the first-ever shareholder resolution filed regarding Alaska's western Arctic.  The 25.8% vote in favor of the resolution represents the highest vote ever given by shareholders on a question of wilderness preservation.

 

<p>"Today's vote sends an unmistakable message to ConocoPhillips about the importance of Teshekpuk Lake and about the company's broader environmental policies," said Athan Manuel, of the U.S. PIRG Education Fund's Arctic Wilderness Campaign. "More and more Americans – and shareholders - are beginning to realize how important it is to protect these one of a kind areas."

 

<p>Teshekpuk provides critical migratory bird habitat, and is central to the lives of local Native populations who use the area for subsistence fishing and hunting.  The resolution calls on ConocoPhillips to consider the potential environmental damage that would result from drilling for oil and gas in the western Arctic, especially the northeast planning area adjacent to Teshekpuk Lake. It goes on to ask the company to consider not drilling in that region.  The Teshekpuk Lake region, an area that encompasses the most important and sensitive wetland complexes in the circumpolar Arctic, supports the highest density of nesting waterfowl and shorebirds on Alaska's North Slope.  The fight over the fate of Alaska's western Arctic is featured in this month's National Geographic.   

 

<p>"This is a landmark day for Teshekpuk Lake and for all threatened ecosystems around the world," said Andrew Shalit of Green Century Capital Management.  "Over one quarter of the shareholders of an oil company have said, 'Sometimes you shouldn't drill.  You have to consider the environmental cost.' We hope ConocoPhillips and other oil companies will take that message to heart and develop policies to protect the world's most sensitive ecosystems."

 

<p>The 25.8% percent vote is the highest ever received by a shareholder resolution on the subject of wilderness preservation.  This vote guarantees that the preservation of Teshekpuk Lake will stay on agenda of ConocoPhillips' management in the coming year.

<p>Drilling in protected/sensitive areas

<p>2006 – ConocoPhillips

 

 

<p>WHEREAS:  in the 1998 Record of Decision, Secretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt relied on extensive scientific evaluation in making his decision to protect certain critical wildlife habitat areas in the northeast portion of the National Petroleum Reserve--Alaska;  

 

<p>WHEREAS: approximately 580,000 acres were not made available for oil and gas leasing because the area encompasses key goose molting habitat and critical caribou habitat, and a smaller area of adjacent lands was open for leasing with language limiting surface exploration or development activities; 

 

<p>WHEREAS: this protected area includes the Teshekpuk Lake region, an area that encompasses the most important and sensitive wetland complexes in the circumpolar Arctic, and supports the highest density of nesting waterfowl and shorebirds in the National Petroleum Reserve--Alaska;

 

<p>WHEREAS: Babbitt stated "This is a balanced plan that carefully weighs the impacts on a fragile Arctic landscape and its abundant wildlife with the long-term economic future of Alaskans"; 

 

<p>WHEREAS: in January 2005, the Bureau of Land Management announced its final proposal to repeal the last remaining protections from critical wildlife habitats protected under the 1998 ROD;

 

<p>WHEREAS: tens of thousands of geese, waterfowl, and caribou will be displaced by roads, pipelines, air strips, and gravel mines if this area is drilled in;

 

<p>WHERAS: ConocoPhillips literature states, "For several decades, the company's focus has been on preserving and protecting the habitats of birds all over the world... ConocoPhillips and its employees participate in a broad variety of projects to help refine scientific knowledge about birds, to protect and improve wildlife habitats and to provide educational programs about birds."

 

<p>WHEREAS: pledging not to drill sensitive ecosystems will enhance our company's image and reputation with consumers, elected officials, current and potential employees, and investors.

 

<p>RESOLVED, Shareholders request that the Board of Directors prepare a report, at reasonable cost and omitting proprietary information, on the potential environmental damage that would result from drilling for oil and gas in the area inside the National Petroleum Reserve--Alaska originally protected by the 1998 ROD.  The report should consider the implications of a policy of refraining from drilling in such areas and should be available to investors by the 2007 annual meeting.

 

<p>Supporting Statement

 

<p>Approximately 580,000 acres of the National Petroleum Reserve were not made available for oil and gas leasing because the area encompasses key goose molting habitat.  Geese require remote, secure sites for their annual molt, during which time energy demands are high and the birds are highly vulnerable to disturbance by predators and humans. Disturbance by low-flying aircraft and industrial development is an especially serious problem.   

 

<p>Drilling in the area protected by the 1998 ROD would not only harm the core wildlife habitats of the caribou and waterfowl, but it will also have a significant impact on the Alaskan Natives who use the area for subsistence fishing and hunting.   

 

<p>Vote YES for this proposal, which will improve our Company's reputation as a leader in environmentally responsible energy recovery.
