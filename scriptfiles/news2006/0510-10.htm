<p>WASHINGTON - May 10 - The League of Women Voters of the United States strongly supports the reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act (VRA) and calls upon Congress to reauthorize and restore this important civil rights bill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since our founding, protecting and promoting the right of every citizen to vote has been a guiding principle,&rdquo; said national League president Kay J. Maxwell. &ldquo;The Voting Rights Act has institutionalized that principle by outlawing discriminatory practices in elections and protecting the rights of minority voters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there is significant evidence that there are still major barriers to equal minority voter participation. Some minority voters still face obstacles to voting, whether from attempts to dilute the strength of minority voters through unfair redistricting or from the lack of bilingual ballots for citizens who are limited English proficient &ndash; the contemporary equivalent of the last century&rsquo;s literacy test. </p>
<p>Important provisions in the Voting Rights Act that protect against these barriers are due to expire in 2007. &ldquo;These sections need to be reauthorized to continue to provide a strong deterrent to persistent voting rights violations,&rdquo; said Maxwell.</p>
<p>The House of Representatives and Senate are considering bills that will restore and reauthorize the VRA, called the Fannie Lou Hamer, Rosa Parks, and Coretta Scott King Voting Rights Act Reauthorization and Amendments Act of 2006. The League is urging members of Congress to cosponsor and support these bills.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Americans are proud of the Voting Rights Act and rely on it to protect the essential expression of our democracy, the citizen&rsquo;s right to vote,&rdquo; said Maxwell. &ldquo;We must reauthorize the historic legislation that guarantees this fundamental right.&rdquo;</p>
