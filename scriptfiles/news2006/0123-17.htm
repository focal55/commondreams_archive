<p>WASHINGTON - January 23 - The Human Rights Campaign Foundation today released <a href="http://www.hrc.org/placestowork/">Best Places to Work for GLBT</a> Equality, a new online resource that gives job seekers the information they need to find out which employers support gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender employees and consumers.

<p>“From stocking shelves to managing money to assembling an automobile, job seekers in almost any field can find a fair-minded employer,” said HRC President Joe Solmonese. “<a href="http://www.hrc.org/placestowork/">Best Places to Work</a> lets gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender job seekers know which companies to put at the top of their list.”

<p>The list of more than 100 companies is based on data from the HRC Foundation’s 2005 Corporate Equality Index, an annual report card on corporate America’s treatment of GLBT employees, consumers and investors. Corporations are rated on a scale from zero to 100 on key criteria, including protection against discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity, parity of health care benefits for domestic partners and other criteria.

<p>“More and more companies understand that employees should have access to the same policies and protections regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity,” added Solmonese. “The Human Rights Campaign’s workplace advocacy has pushed the bar higher and corporate America is rising to the challenge.”

<p>More than 100 companies reached perfect scores this year, with Whole Foods Market being the most recent addition to the list and only supermarket chain to score 100 percent.
