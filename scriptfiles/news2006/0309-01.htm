<p>WASHINGTON - March 9 - The Campaign for a Cleaner Congress (CCC) today released the most comprehensive review of congressional records and campaign disclosure reports to examine new Majority Leader John Boehner’s (R-OH) luxury travel from January 1999 – September 2005.  CCC found that Boehner has traveled outside his district 180 times, while only returning home to Ohio 149 times during that period. Boehner’s extensive travel outside his southwest Ohio district frequently included luxury golf destinations like St. Andrews, Scotland and Pebble Beach, CA.  Most trips were paid for with money from special interests and lobbyists – either through direct junketing, or through money given to his political action committee or his congressional campaign. 

 

<p>Privately funded luxury travel is one of the driving forces behind the current House Lobbying Scandal, but Boehner has steadily backed away from a ban on the practice, even though he was elected majority leader as a “reform” candidate. 

 

<p>Rep. Boehner’s travel outside the district was most often conducted through his political action committee, Freedom Project PAC. From 1999-2005, Boehner took 119 trips that were funded by his PAC. This prominent PAC travel and fundraising efforts was designed both to give access to donors and lobbyists, and to raise Boehner’s stature among his House colleagues and help propel him into the Republican leadership. 

 

<p>“Ohioans are entitled to ask what John Boehner’s jet-setting lifestyle doing for them,” asked CCC Director Mike Casey. “He spends so much time enjoying sun and fun with lobbyists on their dime that there is no way he has the time to listen what Ohioans need.”  

 

<p>Boehner’s travel included stops at many of the top golf resorts in the world, not a surprising finding considering Golf Digest once reported that he plays about 100 rounds a year. Yet while many of his colleagues in Congress have become serious about reform, Boehner remains unapologetic about his lobbyist-funded lifestyle, despite the fact that it reflects the same influence-peddling culture that has led to the current scandal-ridden situation. 

 

<p>“[I]f someone I’ve gotten to know on the golf course comes into my office win a good argument, I tend to want to listen,” Boehner told Golf Digest.

 

<p>The Campaign for a Cleaner Congress has proposed a five-point plan to clean up Congress that includes a ban on free travel for members of Congress and their families. The entire plan is available at: <a href="http://www.cleanercongress.org/">http://www.cleanercongress.org/</a><!-- #EndEditable -->
