<p>WASHINGTON - November 15 - Today&#8217;s decision by the International Labor Organization (ILO) sends a powerful message to the Bush Administration that the international community rejects its attempts to limit the collective bargaining rights of government employees entrusted with protecting our nation&#8217;s security. In response to a complaint filed by the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE), the ILO&#8217;s Committee on Freedom of Association ruled that the Bush-created Transportation Security Administration (TSA) violated the fundamental rights of 56,000 airport screeners by denying them the right to organize and bargain collectively.</P><P>&nbsp;The Bush Administration tried to justify its 2002 decision to deny representation and collective bargaining rights to airport screeners at TSA on the basis of national security. The AFL-CIO and AFGE join the international community in its recognition that national security and worker rights are not mutually exclusive. At a time when airport screeners need a voice on the job to highlight where improvements can be made in our national security, the Bush Administration continues to stifle dialogue. Today&#8217;s decision further calls into question the Administration&#8217;s policy of using national security to justify the denial of basic worker rights.</P><P>&nbsp;The decision by the ILO amplifies the growing voices heard around the country and the world that are calling on the Bush Administration to recognize internationally accepted workers&#8217; rights standards. We implore the Bush Administration to follow the ILO&#8217;s recommendations and immediately grant collective bargaining and all other labor rights to TSA workers.</P><P align=center><EM>AFGE is the only union that has actively fought on behalf of employment rights for Transportation Security Officers. Although transportation security officers remain deprived of a collective bargaining agreement, AFGE represents these employees before the Disciplinary Review Board, EEOC, courts, in Congress and in the media.</EM>
