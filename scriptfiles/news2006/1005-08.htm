<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->WASHINGTON - October 5 - Paul Helmke,  president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, sent the  following letter today to President George W. Bush.: </p>
<p>   President George W. Bush</p>
<p>   The White House</p>
<p>   1600 Pennsylvania Ave. NW</p>
<p>   Washington, DC </p>
<p>   Dear Mr. President:</p>
<p>   I was pleased to hear that you have asked your staff to  convene a White House Conference on school gun violence. I want  to congratulate you for taking this action and offer my strong  support.</p>
<p>   As the mayor of Fort Wayne, Ind. for three terms, I saw  firsthand the terrible toll gun violence takes on our  communities. As mayor, I tried everything I could to fight this  scourge. I worked with survivors, faith leaders, neighborhood  activists and law enforcement on a variety of programs. We didn't  find all the answers, but working with all the groups, violence  did begin to decline in our community.</p>
<p>   A few months ago, I was approached by members of the board of  directors of the Brady Center and Campaign to Prevent Gun  Violence about leading that organization into the future. I was  deeply honored to have the Board ask me to take over the  organization as president, which I did in July. They knew they  were getting a different kind of perspective by selecting a  republican former mayor from Indiana. Although being in  Washington, D.C. is a big change from Fort Wayne, I truly  believed that working to make our schools and communities safer  from gun violence was a critical task that I should not shy away  from.</p>
<p>   It is in my capacity as president of the Brady Center and  Campaign that I write to you today. I am asking you to approach  next week's conference in a way that will defy the pundits and  brush aside narrow and partisan political pressures. You have a  unique opportunity to help start an honest effort to reduce gun  violence in our schools and elsewhere. It is my fondest wish that  our country can start down the path towards resolving a divisive  argument that has lasted for many years and take steps that will  keep our children safer.</p>
<p>   I know you want your efforts in this policy area to produce  results. I know that you will face strong political forces urging  you to sweep some potential solutions under a rug. I urge you to  resist those forces and help America have an honest conversation  about gun violence. We all understand that politics is the art of  the possible and that it is very hard for political leaders to  tackle intractable problems and make progress. But we need to  have a legitimate national conversation about the root causes and  costs of gun violence and a genuine, multi-dimensional discussion  of the policy options available. </p>
<p>   I stand ready to assist. Events like the terrible ones of  recent days are bound to occur again and again in the future  unless we take concrete actions to make our communities safer.  Please allow me to help you in this formidable challenge. </p>
<p>   Sincerely,</p>
<p>   Paul Helmke, president, The Brady Center Campaign to Prevent  Gun Violence, Washington, D.C. </p>
