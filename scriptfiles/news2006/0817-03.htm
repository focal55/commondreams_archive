<p>WASHINGTON - August 17 - The storyline of this  summer's blockbuster might seem far fetched but illegal wildlife  trade specialists know the plot all too well.  In recent years,  there have been several instances of people literally smuggling  snakes on a plane.</p>
<p>   Wildlife smugglers are routinely caught smuggling exotic  snakes, lizards, turtles and birds on international flights for  the lucrative black market for exotic wildlife as pets and for  the specialist hobbyist. This market is worth billions of dollars  annually and the profit margins can be even greater than the  trade in drugs.</p>
<p>   Most countries protect their endangered wildlife and do not  allow open trade so the wildlife moves through  underground crime networks that link collectors to smugglers and  illicit traders.  To keep one step ahead of law enforcement,  criminals constantly find new ways to smuggle live animals for  the journey from their homes in the jungle or desert to the cages  of collectors.</p>
<p>   "As with most crimes, money and passion are the reasons why  someone would take crazy risks to smuggle a snake on a plane,  said Crawford Allan, Deputy Director of TRAFFIC North America.   "Rarity, the novelty factor and unusual coloration make snakes  more valuable and desirable, and new, little known species are  particularly the 'must-have' for the obsessive collector."</p>
<p>   For example, a new snake species that can change color was  discovered this June in Borneo.  This is so unusual that wildlife  trade experts believe that it is only a matter of time before the  "chameleon snake' is smuggled for collectors in the U.S. and  Europe.  TRAFFIC works to keep law enforcement aware of such  emerging threats.</p>
<p>   Snakes are not allowed in the cabin area of a plane so in  order to avoid security smugglers sometimes wrap up and tape live  snakes to their bodies or conceal them in pockets, or even in  their underwear.  In 1998, a man was caught in an airport in  Australia with 10 green tree pythons (Morelia viridis) concealed  under his clothing.  Many of the smuggled animals discovered on  planes are endangered species that are under either strict trade  regulations or banned from commercial trade entirely.</p>
<p>   In rare instances, Customs authorities have found air cargo  shipments of live venomous snakes like cobras and black mambas  being used as a cover for drug smuggling – drugs are hidden in  false compartments within the shipping crates holding the snakes.   Most of the time, the snakes themselves are the precious cargo.   In 1998, airport authorities in Jakarta once opened 54 boxes  labeled "live eels" and found 1020 live, Indian spectacled cobras  (Naja naja) which is a highly venemous snake.</p>
<p>   TRAFFIC is working with airlines to increase awareness that  the "snakes on a plane scenario" is actually a real possibility  on their flights, and that airline personnel can help law  enforcement stop the smuggling of endangered species.  TRAFFIC is currently training authorities and airlines about the clever tricks used to hide and smuggle wildlife via air transport.</p>
