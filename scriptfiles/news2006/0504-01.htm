<p>WASHINGTON - May 4 - The U.S. House of Representatives last night narrowly passed new ethics legislation aimed at increasing lobbying disclosures. The vote was 217-213 on the measure, which now must be reconciled with an earlier Senate bill that contains stringent provisions.</p>
<p>The House bill would require lobbyists to file reports quarterly instead of semiannually, list donations made to federal candidates and political action committees, and report public gifts given to lawmakers or congressional aides. However, critics noted that the bill does not address the need for greater oversight and administration of the rules.</p>
<p>Research and analysis conducted by the Center for Public Integrity shows that from 1998 to 2004, lobbying disclosure rules have gone largely unenforced:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nearly 14,000 lobbying documents that should have been filed periodically with the Senate Office of Public Records are missing. </li>
<li>Almost one in five of all companies registered to lobby are missing required disclosure forms. </li>
<li>Almost 20 percent of all forms are filed late. </li>
<li>Nearly 300 individuals and entities that filed some disclosure forms lobbied without registering.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, the findings of a forthcoming Center study of privately sponsored congressional travel will show that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rules prohibiting lobbying firms to pay for travel are often ignored or waived. </li>
<li>Travel disclosure forms are commonly filed late, are incomplete and often are amended after media scrutiny. </li>
<li>Members of Congress frequently ignore or have gotten the ethics committee to waive rules restricting the companions they take on privately financed trips. </li>
</ul>
<p>Center for Public Integrity Executive Director, Roberta Baskin said of the bill. <em>"This kind of lobbying reform gives the term 'paper tiger' a new meaning. In its attempt to address the problems at hand, Congress seems to be pursuing a plan to bury itself in paper, making it even harder to enforce the rules."</p>
<p>Previous attempts to address lack of enforcement have been met by strong opposition. In March, Sens. John McCain, R-Ariz., Susan Collins, R-Maine, and Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., proposed the creation of an Independent Office of Public Integrity to oversee lobbying activities and enforce disclosure laws. Their amendment was defeated by in a 67-30 vote.</p>
<p>In 1993, former FEC Chairman Scott Thomas asked Congress "to consider placing the responsibility of administering the [Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1993] with the Federal Election Commission." His request also was rejected.</p>

<p>The Federal Election Commission, it should be noted, utilizes 391 employees and a $54 million budget to monitor campaign contributions. The Senate Office of Public Records, in contrast, employs fewer than a dozen people to monitor lobbying. In addition, Center for Public Integrity research shows that since 1998, almost twice as much money has been spent on lobbying as on campaign contributions.</p><ContentEnd />
