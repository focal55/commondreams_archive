<p>SANTA MONICA, California - August 28 - As patient  advocates prepare for an historic showdown over universal health  care today in the California Assembly, a consumer group announced  a new online game today allowing players to destroy insurer greed  and join supporters of a California Health Plan open to all  residents of the state.</p>
<p>   The first-person shooter game, &quot;Nurse Avenger,&quot; is available  at <a href="http://releases.usnewswire.com/redir.asp?ReleaseID=71338&Link=http://www.calhealthplan.org">http://www.calhealthplan.org</a>. On the Web site players can sign  up to help fight for universal health care -- called the  California Health Plan -- and send a fax to legislators urging  them to pass SB 840.</p>
<p>   In the fast-paced game, the player is awarded points for  fighting mobster-styled insurance company and HMO and insurance  reps trying to kill a patient in a hospital bed. Special weapons  include: Waste Whacker (HMOs and health insurers waste 25 percent  of our money on overhead and profit), Salary Sucker, Voice Mail  Avenger and a Purchasing Power Mega Weapon. To unleash a special  attack, players click on a &quot;Nurse Avenger&quot; icon when it appears  on the screen. If the player defeats all the HMO bosses, he or  she &quot;saves&quot; the state $8 billion -- the predicted annual savings  to the state of SB 840. </p>
<p>   &quot;We've taken the fight for reform to the video game generation  to recruit more universal health care warriors,&quot; said Jerry  Flanagan of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights  (FTCR). &quot;Health care is increasingly priced out of reach for 20- somethings. Under the California Health Plan, the billions of  dollars now wasted on insurance middlemen, CEO pay, record  corporate profits, overhead and advertising would be used to  provide good, affordable care for all who need it.&quot;</p>
<p>   Insurers have spent $3.7 million in campaign contributions in  California since 2005. Gov. Schwarzenegger, who alone has  received $765,000 from health insurers, has said he will veto the  bill.</p>
<p>   SB 840 calls for replacing the private, uncompetitive and  unregulated health insurance market with a public insurance  program that would utilize the 25 percent of revenue currently  wasted on overhead by private insurers to provide better health  care for all Californians. Compared to private insurers, public  health insurance programs typically spend only 2 to 3 percent on  overhead.</p>
<p>   For more information about why California needs universal  health care and how everyone can be insured and still cut $8  billion from what is currently being spent, go  to <a href="http://releases.usnewswire.com/redir.asp?ReleaseID=71338&Link=http://www.consumerwatchdog.org/healthcare/cal-medicare">http://www.consumerwatchdog.org/healthcare/cal-medicare</a>.</p>
