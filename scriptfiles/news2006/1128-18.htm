PHOENIX - November 28 - The American Civil Liberties Union today asked an Arizona court of appeals to uphold a lower court decision allowing women prisoners to obtain timely, safe, and legal abortions. </P>
<P class=text>&#8220;Preventing women prisoners from getting abortions is dangerous and unjust,&#8221; said Brigitte Amiri, a Staff Attorney for the ACLU Reproductive Freedom Project, who argued the case before the court today. &#8220;Courts have repeatedly made it clear that being incarcerated doesn&#8217;t mean a woman gives up her right to have an abortion any more than it means that she gives up her right to bear a child.&#8221;</P>
<P class=text>At issue is an unwritten Maricopa County Jail policy denying women prisoners access to abortion care. The policy prohibits jail officials from transporting a prisoner to obtain an abortion unless she gets a court order first. The jail transports prisoners without a court order for all other necessary medical care, including prenatal care and childbirth. The jail also regularly transports prisoners for various non-medical reasons, including to visit terminally ill family members or attend relatives&#8217; funerals.</P>
<P class=text>In August 2005, the Superior Court of Arizona, Maricopa County, struck down the jail&#8217;s policy, holding that it violates women&#8217;s reproductive rights and serves &#8220;no legitimate penological purpose.&#8221; After weeks of being denied access to abortion services, a pregnant prisoner filed the case in May 2004 on behalf of herself and future prisoners seeking abortions.</P>
<P class=text>&#8220;A woman in jail has a right to make her own decision about whether or not to have a child,&#8221; said Alessandra Soler Meetze, Executive Director of the ACLU of Arizona. &#8220;Arizona prison officials cannot ignore the medical needs of prisoners simply because they do not agree with the decision to end a pregnancy.&#8221;</P>
<P class=text>According to the ACLU&#8217;s brief, Joe Arpaio, the sheriff in charge of Maricopa County Jail, has &#8220;maintained the Policy throughout his tenure, consistent with his well-publicized stance against abortion and his &#8216;America&#8217;s toughest sheriff&#8217; persona.&#8221; Arpaio himself has admitted that under this policy, &#8220;The gal may have the baby by the time it gets through the court system.&#8221; </P>
<P class=text>The ACLU today argued the case, <EM>Doe v. Arpaio</EM>, 1 CA-CV 05-0835 in the Arizona Court of Appeals Division One. Lawyers on the case include Amiri, Talcott Camp, Jennifer McAllister-Nevins, and Charu Chandrasekhar with the ACLU Reproductive Freedom Project.</P>
