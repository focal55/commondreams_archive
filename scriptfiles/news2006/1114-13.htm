<p>SAN FRANCISCO  - November 14 - As talks over a solution to the 
problem of global climate change wrap up in 
Nairobi this week, a broad coalition of 
environmental and human rights groups purchased a 
full page ad in The Financial Times today calling 
on the World Bank and G8 nations to end subsidies 
for the international oil industry that come at 
the expense of the environment and impoverished 
countries. The groups also called on policymakers 
to help fight global poverty by supporting broader debt cancellation.

<p>Following on the heels of the just released Stern 
Report, which called climate change "the greatest 
and widest-ranging market failure ever seen," the 
ad criticizes the World Bank for having provided 
more than $5 billion in subsidies to the oil 
industry since 1992, while devoting only five 
percent of its energy budget to clean, renewable 
energy sources. The U.S. government has spent 
even more on subsidies for Big Oil, a policy 
which has fueled global warming, encouraged oil 
dependence, and increased conflict, poverty and 
debt around the world. The ad notes, "On November 
7, Americans voted for an agenda that called for 
an end to the support of Big Oil, and we urge 
Congress to act on this promise in the coming months."

<p>According to the ad, "Soaring oil prices are 
undermining the benefits of limited debt 
cancellation in many of the world's most 
impoverished countries, particularly those that 
are oil importers.the estimated cost of 
Tanzania's oil imports rose from $190 million in 
2002 to $480 million this year - for the same 
amount of oil. In comparison, debt cancellation 
is expected to only free up about $140 million 
for Tanzania in 2006. Furthermore, this 
cancellation doesn't even touch on the debt held 
by large private banks in London, Paris and New York."

<p>While the world's poorest nations suffer, oil 
companies are raking in record profits. 
ExxonMobil reported profits of $4.7 million an hour in July 2006.

<p>In Chad, the World Bank supported an ExxonMobil 
oil project that has exacerbated conflict and 
poverty in the African nation. Upon completion of 
the project, Chad's authoritarian president 
increased military spending and ripped up an 
agreement with the World Bank meant to ensure 
that oil revenues went to fighting poverty. The 
World Bank ended its objections as soon as the 
president threatened to cut off the oil if his terms were not accepted.

<p>When Ecuador's government sought to use oil 
revenues to alleviate poverty, the International 
Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank protested 
by withholding promised new lending and forced 
the country to pay its debt to the IMF, World Bank and other creditors.

<p>"Around the world, our tax dollars have been 
improperly used to subsidize Big Oil instead of 
providing clean energy for the poor, combating 
climate change, and ending our destructive oil 
addiction," the ad continues. "It is time for G8 
governments and institutions like the World Bank 
to stop using development assistance to support Big Oil."

<p>The organizations that purchased the ad include 
Rainforest Action Network, Jubilee USA, Oil 
Change International, Bank Information Center, 
Friends of the Earth and Amazon Watch.
