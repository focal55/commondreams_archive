<p>WASHINGTON - August 29 - The following statement  was released today by Democracy 21 President Fred Wertheimer:</p>
<p>   Democracy 21 strongly applauds the votes cast today by three  FEC Commissioners to reject a proposed ''emergency'' regulation  by FEC Commissioner Hans von Spakovsky that would have violated  administrative procedure rules applicable to the FEC,  contradicted the positions being taken by the FEC in two pending  lawsuits, opened a major loophole in the Bipartisan Campaign  Reform Act of 2002 (BCRA) and on its face violated the statutory  language of BCRA.</p>
<p>   FEC Vice-Chairman Robert Lenhard and Commissioners Ellen  Weintraub and Steven Walther deserve great credit for voting  today against the irresponsible proposal offered by Commissioner  von Spakovsky and unfortunately supported by two other  Commissioners, Chairman Michael Toner and David Mason.</p>
<p>   Under FEC rules, the 3-3 tie vote resulted in the defeat of  the proposed new regulation.</p>
<p>   The von Spakovsky proposal, made in the guise of an  ''emergency'' regulation, even though the issued had been pending  at the FEC since February, was an effort to jam through a new  regulation without the time required by law for the public to  comment.</p>
<p>   The proposal also was in direct conflict with the position  correctly being taken by the FEC in the courts to defend the  constitutionality of the BCRA ''electioneering communications''  provisions, and to prevent a major loophole being opened in the  law for sham ''issue ads.''</p>
<p>   The von Spakovsky proposal itself would have opened a major  campaign finance loophole in BCRA and allowed corporations and  labor unions again to use their organizational funds to finance  campaign ads in the guise of ''issue ads.''</p>
<p>   This loophole-opening proposal was originally made by interest  groups ranging from the AFL-CIO and the National Education  Association to the Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<p>   To their credit, the three Democratic Commissioners in voting  against the von Spakovsky proposal rejected the views of the pro- Democratic groups who supported the adoption of a new regulation.  In voting for the von Spakovsky proposal, the three Republican  Commissioners supported a proposed regulation that if adopted  would have violated the FEC's own obligations under  administrative procedure rules, contradicted the FEC's own  litigating position in the courts and undermined the law that the  FEC is suppose to enforce.</p>
<p>   Democracy 21 and the Campaign Legal Center filed comments with  the FEC opposing the proposed rule. A copy of the comments is  available at <a href="http://releases.usnewswire.com/redir.asp?ReleaseID=71434&Link=http://www.democracy21.org">http://www.democracy21.org</a>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
