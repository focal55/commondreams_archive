<p>WASHINGTON - January 24 - Conflict and &ldquo;un-natural&rdquo; disasters have taken a heavy toll in Indonesia and Sri Lanka, yet new analysis from the Worldwatch Institute shows important lessons can be learned from the countries&rsquo; differing responses to these difficult circumstances. In Indonesia&rsquo;s Aceh province,
  the December 2004 tsunami killed some 170,000 people, more than ten times as
  many as perished in Aceh&rsquo;s 29-year war for independence. The disaster
  convinced the government and rebels that peace was indispensable for rebuilding.
  But in Sri Lanka, where the toll of the 1983-2002 civil war far surpassed the
  number of tsunami victims, bickering over tsunami aid reinforced ethnic and
  political divisions that may lead to resumed conflict.</p>
<p>&ldquo;While grim in its origin, post-disaster humanitarian action can be
  a powerful catalyst for overcoming deep human divides,&rdquo; says <a href="/about/staff/mrenner/">Michael
  Renner</a>, Senior Researcher and Director of the Institute's Global Security Project. &ldquo;But
  humanitarian impulses must be translated into tangible political change, or
  else lasting peace may not be achieved.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Renner recently returned from a fact-finding mission to Aceh, where he observed
  unexpectedly positive developments in the current peace process.&nbsp;But Renner
  cautions that the world community needs to keep close watch on this process
  to prevent backsliding and to reinvigorate a sluggish reconstruction effort
  that could become, in itself, a cause for resentment and new conflict.</p>
<p>In recognition of the dramatic rise in the numbers and impacts of disasters
  worldwide, Worldwatch has initiated a major research and public policy project
  on &ldquo;un-natural&rdquo; disasters, conflict, and peacemaking. Many of the
  earthquakes, hurricanes, and floods that battered the globe last year can be
  categorized as &ldquo;un-natural disasters&rdquo; because their impact was
  greatly exacerbated by human actions&mdash;including wetlands destruction,
  global warming, and population growth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The global toll from disasters has climbed significantly over the past
  twenty years,&rdquo; explains Worldwatch Staff Researcher <a href="/about/staff/zchafe/">Zo&euml; Chafe</a>, co-contributor
  to the project. In 2005, nearly 125 million people were injured, lost their
  home, or required other immediate assistance as a result of disasters.&nbsp; Over
  100,000 lives were lost, in addition to the 230,000 people killed by the tsunami
  at the end of 2004. Total economic damages in 2005 reached a record $200 billion,
  including $125 billion in losses from <a href="/press/news/2005/09/02/">Hurricane
  Katrina</a> alone. The single greatest
  human toll followed the October earthquake in Pakistan and India, a disaster
  that continues to claim lives as survivors face harsh winter conditions.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>The Institute&rsquo;s new project focuses on the effects of disasters in areas
  already stressed by violent conflict. Activities and outputs include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>An assessment of human-influenced disaster trends, and the prospects for
    peacemaking in Aceh and Sri Lanka, in Worldwatch&rsquo;s newly released <i><a href="/pubs/sow/2006/">State
    of the World 2006</a></i> report.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>A series of Policy Briefs analyzing specific cases where conflict and disaster
    have intersected, for the purpose of distilling key lessons and making policy
    recommendations.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>A new <a href="/features/disasters/">Worldwatch web portal</a> that presents current disaster trends, provides
    opinion pieces and analysis, offers links to information from partner organizations,
    and details the Institute&rsquo;s research activities and speaking engagements
    on disasters and peacemaking.</li>
</ul>
<p>As illustrated by the Indian Ocean tsunami, Hurricane Katrina, and the recent
  <a href="/press/news/2005/11/09/">earthquake in Kashmir</a>, disasters devastate neighborhoods and disable basic
  community services, leading to economic and political insecurity. Renner and
  Chafe stress that &ldquo;humanitarian peacemaking&rdquo;&mdash;conciliatory
  steps taken in conflict zones in the aftermath of disasters&mdash;should be
  complemented by &ldquo;environmental peacemaking&rdquo;: joint projects to
  protect critical ecosystems carried out by neighboring states that find it
  difficult to cooperate on other issues.</p>
<p>The international community now has a crucial role to play. Beyond diplomatic
  efforts to monitor peacemaking, it is imperative that global leaders address
  the role of human-induced climate change in global weather patterns. Over the
  next few decades, the number of people living in disaster-prone areas will
  continue to grow, greatly increasing the vulnerability of many communities
  as they face more frequent and more intense storms, floods, and droughts. Pragmatic
  government leadership on climate change and disaster preparedness can save
  lives and reduce economic damages in the years to come.</p>
