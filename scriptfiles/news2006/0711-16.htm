<p>WASHINGTON - July 11 - The Commonwealth of Kentucky cannot block its employees&#8217; access to political blogs at work while permitting the use of traditional news sites, Public Citizen said in a lawsuit filed today in a federal court in Lexington, Ky.</p>

<p>The lawsuit, filed on behalf of popular online journalist Mark Nickolas by Public Citizen and Louisville&#160;attorney Jennifer A. Moore of Fernandez Friedman Grossman &amp; Kohn, contends that the state unconstitutionally singled out BluegrassReport.org, Nickolas&#8217;s political news site covering issues of Kentucky&#160;politics, in violation of the Equal Protection Clause and First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.&#160;</p>

<p>&#160;Nickolas&#8217; award-winning Web site had been read heavily by state employees, but it was banned on June 21, a day after Nickolas was quoted in a <i>New York Times</i>&#160;article criticizing Republican Gov. Ernie Fletcher, who was recently indicted in connection to a political patronage scandal involving lucrative state jobs.</p>

<p>When questioned about the move, the state claimed that it had formulated a policy to add sites that it considered &#8220;blogs&#8221; to a list of sites banned on state employees&#8217; computers, including gambling and pornographic sites. But blogs on mainstream media Web sites, as well as prominent conservative blogs such as the Drudge Report, remained accessible.</p>

<p>&#8220;The state has not consistently enforced its ban and has not yet given a coherent reason why blogs devoted to news and politics should be treated any differently than traditional news sites,&#8221; said Greg Beck, the Public Citizen attorney who filed the lawsuit. &#8220;The circumstances of this case suggest that the state intentionally targeted Bluegrass Report because of the political content of the site.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The state&#8217;s blocking of BluegrassReport.org constitutes content-based discrimination. While the state may regulate what its employees do during work hours, it cannot selectively control the reading material of employees based on content,&#8221; said attorney Jennifer A. Moore. &#8220;The state also cannot discriminate based on traditional and non-traditional media sites.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The defendants&#8217; censorship of all sites the state classifies as &#8216;blogs&#8217; is arbitrary, standardless, and constitutes content-based discrimination against non-traditional news websites,&#8221; the lawsuit states.</p>
