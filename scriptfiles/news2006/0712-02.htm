<p>SAN DIEGO, California  - July 12 - This weekend, hundreds of "ordinary" citizens will stuff more education and celebration into a Saturday than they ever thought possible. They'll come from across the country to gather again for DemocracyFest(TM), an annual event that shows ordinary citizens how to gain influence in American politics. The 3rd annual DemocracyFest is a 3-day festival, which will take place at San Diego State University, on July 14-16.

<p>On this special Saturday, participants will have the opportunity to learn from political strategists such as David Sirota, author of "Hostile Takeover: How Big Money & Corruption Conquered Our Government - and How We Take it Back." They'll ponder questions such as can we secure life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness through global debt cancellation with Nobel Peace Prize nominee Wahu Kaara. At night, they'll laugh with Air America Radio talk show host Al Franken, boogie to the Flying Other Brothers and Gary Hoey, and be inspired by such prominent political leaders as Democratic National Committee Chairman Howard Dean. Chairman Dean's speech will be open to the public and free of charge.

<p>"Folks can select activities from an extensive program that includes newly released progressive films, workshops and panels; advanced activist training; and networking with grassroots activists," said Jessica Falker, DemocracyFest cofounder. Saturday night begins with DemStock where attendees will rejuvenate while listening to the spirited Flying Other Brothers, who are back by popular demand. "DemStock" is described by San Diego For Democracy Chair Charlie Imes as "our own version of Woodstock, only with no mud, much better food and bar service." Immediately following DemStock is the Beach Party Blowout, with Air America Radio talk show host/humorist Al Franken as the Master of Ceremonies.

<p>Beach Party Blowout speakers will include Democratic National Committee Chairman Gov. Howard Dean, Rep. Maxine Waters, Paul Hackett, an Iraq War veteran and former senatorial candidate from Ohio, and comedian and Air America host Marc Maron.

<p>Musical entertainment for the party will include Surfdog recording artist Gary Hoey, award-winning singer/songwriting team Berkeley Hart, Cindy Lee Berryhill, and Grammy winner/guitarist Laurence Juber. Juber, the former lead guitarist in Paul McCartney's WINGS, is a composer and arranger whose music has been featured in film and TV. The event is designed to inspire and recharge attendees for Day 3 of the event.

<p>DemocracyFestTM is a DemocracyFest Incorporated (DFI) production and San Diego for Democracy is the host of the 3rd Annual DemocracyFest. Tickets for Saturday Night are ONLY $25, an incredible value for the entertainment and inspiration promised. DNC Chairman Howard Dean's speech will be open to the public and free of charge.
