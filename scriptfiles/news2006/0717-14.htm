<p>WASHINGTON - July 17 - The Humane Society of the United States is proud to announce today it has become the exclusive sponsor of Jay McCarroll at New York's Olympus Fashion Week this fall, where the fur-free fashion designer and winner of the inaugural season of "Project Runway" will debut his spring 2007 collection. 

<p>"I'm thrilled to work with The Humane Society of the United States because I care about animals and love making great clothes that don't cause animals to suffer," McCarroll said. "With so many fun and fashionable alternatives, there's no reason to use fur. As a designer, I know that compassion is in fashion, and the animals need their fur more than I do." 

<p>Jay McCarroll's collection will be his first at New York Fashion Week as an independent designer and will be completely fur-free.  The sponsorship of the McCarroll fashion show is only one part of a relationship with The HSUS to promote fur-free fashion.  McCarroll will also act as a judge in The HSUS' upcoming second annual contest for aspiring student designers, "Cool vs. Cruel" (<a href="http://www.coolvscruel.org" target="_new">www.coolvscruel.org</a>).   

<p>"As a fashion designer and TV personality, Jay McCarroll has the unique ability to influence fashion trends and save countless animal's lives by simply choosing to not use real animal fur in his creations," said Wayne Pacelle, president and CEO of The Humane Society of the United States. "His dedication to promoting compassionate fashion and exposing the cruelty behind the fur industry make him a natural partner for The Humane Society of the United States." 

<p>Jay McCarroll rocketed to fame during the first season of Bravo's "Project Runway" where he was crowned "America's Next Top Designer."  His sharp wit and colorful humor made him a favorite of viewers, but his undeniable creative talent cemented the victory.  McCarroll's popularity on "Project Runway" also made him the star of his own TV special, "Project Jay." 

<p>More than 50 million animals are killed every year for their fur.  Recent investigations of the fur trade in China-the top exporter of fur garments to the United States-have exposed animals being skinned alive and dogs and cats killed by the millions.  Furbearing animals in the United States are killed by techniques that include anal and genital electrocution, neck-breaking, and drowning.  

<p>"The HSUS applauds Jay McCarroll and other leading designers and retailers-such as Ralph Lauren, Stella McCartney, Marc Bouwer, H&M, Zara and J.Crew-for pledging not to use real animal fur in their collections," added Pacelle. "These humane leaders in the fashion industry are making a real difference in animals' lives."
