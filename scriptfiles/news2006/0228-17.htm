<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->WASHINGTON - February 28 - Congressman Dennis J. Kucinich (D-OH) issued the following statement today on President Bush's interview with ABC News' World News Tonight:

<P>"The President now says he does not believe there is going to be a civil war in Iraq.  Put that right up there with his Administration's other greatest hits such as  'mission accomplished', 'we would be greeted as liberators', 'bring it on' or 'Iraqi oil will pay for reconstruction.'

<P>"Can he be so far out of touch that he actually does not know that the United States is already trapped in a civil war in Iraq?  And it is President Bush who helped to create it!  

<P>"The invasion and occupation of Iraq has been an illegal, foreign policy disaster for the US and for the people of Iraq. The ABC interview is another in a long campaign of disinformation and misinformation about the war.  It is time for the truth.  The truth is the United States cannot stay in Iraq any longer."
