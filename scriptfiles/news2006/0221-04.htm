<p>WASHINGTON - February 21 - "While President Bush is viewing the work of the nearly-laid-off employees of the National Renewable Energy Lab in Colorado today, it would make more sense for him to visit the nuclear waste facilities and polluting oil
refineries that would proliferate under his policies.   Admitting that our
oil addiction threatens our national security and our economy should be an impetus for putting existing smart energy solutions in place now to begin breaking that addiction.  But overall the President has refused to put the money where his mouth was--the President's Budget calls for more oil and gas drilling and less conservation and energy efficiency.

<p>"We should not let the bones now thrown by the Bush Administration toward renewable energy obscure its more significant actions -- such as outright opposition to a renewable energy standard in last year's energy bill.

<p>"America can meet its energy needs through aggressive energy efficiency, renewable energy like solar and wind power, and responsible additions to supply.  Every dollar invested in renewables and efficiency makes America more secure without making our families less safe or saddling future generations with debt.  We can meet our energy needs and have a clean and healthy world without nuclear power and the destruction of special places. America deserves a safer, cleaner, and cheaper energy future.

<p>"While President Bush's speeches focus on research for renewable energy, different priorities are reflected in his proposed budget
which:

<p>
<ul>
<li>includes eight billion dollars in anticipated revenues to be realized
through the sale of oil leases in the           Arctic National Wildlife
Refuge;<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>increases oil and gas drilling on Bureau of Land Management lands;<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>pumps more money to study expanding oil and gas development in
deepwater areas off the outer continental shelf;<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>cuts $113 million from Dept of Energy conservation programs and there
is no increased funding for conservation        research, development and
demonstration;<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>cuts by a third the Weatherization Assistance Program, which helps
low-income Americans reduce energy              consumption by improving
their home's energy efficiency;<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>since 2002 has reduced overall energy efficiency by 32 percent.</li>
</ul>     
<p>"When you have an addiction you don't say 'I'll try to kick the habit in 10 or 20 years' or look for a new fix.  By investing in implementing modern technology now, America could cut its dependence on dirty fossil fuels while saving consumers money, preserving treasured places, and keeping Americans safer.  The Bush administration had the opportunity to support a national renewable energy standard last year, but instead opposed its inclusion in the energy bill.

<p>"An energy policy that puts our families ahead of corporate lobbyists would invest in smarter technology to lower energy bills and create jobs, invest in renewable energy and energy efficiency, and raise fuel economy standards to save more oil than the United States currently imports from the entire Persian Gulf or could ever take out of the Arctic Refuge. We don't need to put the health and safety of our families at risk or sacrifice our most treasured lands and coasts to meet our nation's energy needs.  There are better, cleaner, and cheaper energy solutions that can be used to meet our energy needs and protect the environment."
