<p>WASHINGTON - APRIL 25 - The Organic Consumers  Association (OCA) will be joining with other social and  environmental justice groups and tens of thousands of people in  New York City on April 29. &quot;We feel that it is important to have  a presence in New York City on the 29th and that climate change  and the environment are becoming increasingly important issues  for us to speak up about. If the organic community does not unite  its forces with the anti-war movement and with the movements for  environmentalism and social justice then we are not going to make  any changes.&quot; says Ronnie Cummins, executive director of the  Organic Consumers Association.</p>
<p>   OCA will have a table at the Peace and Justice Festival. The  Peace and Justice Festival is a grassroots festival that will  occur at the culmination of the march on April 29; it will take  place at Foley Square from 1 to 6 PM.</p>

<p>   With the effects of increasing global warming being felt  nearly everywhere from New Orleans to Antarctica, OCA is saying  that it is time to take this threat seriously.  &quot;It is past time  that action was taken to reduce climate change and environmental  destruction. Some people might ask, 'why is this an issue for the  organic movement?' For one, twenty-five percent of greenhouse  gasses in the U.S. are generated by industrial agriculture and  long-distance food transportation. We need to switch over to  sustainable agriculture if we are going to slow down and stop the  accelerating climate chaos. There is $20 billion in annual  subsidies going to polluting industrial agriculture and intensive  confinement farming, and that's money that needs to be shifted to  farmers who are transitioning to organic, adopting renewable  energy practices, and developing local and regional markets,&quot;  says Cummins.</p>
<p>   As the dangers of climate change become clearer to the public,  so are the links between what we consume and the environmental  impact of those choices.  &quot;When you buy organic, you're buying  food that was grown without the use of petroleum based  pesticides, herbicides, and fertilizers and when you are buying  local, you are buying food that didn't generate excess greenhouse  gasses through long distance transportation. Consumers are  becoming more aware of these things and thinking about them when  they decide what to purchase. The conscientious consumer is an  increasing force in the marketplace with ten cents of every  grocery store dollar in the United States ($45 billion annually)  being spent on products labeled as organic or natural, and with  the market for healthier and more sustainable food and consumer  items growing rapidly, about 20 percent or more per year. Now it  is time to use our numbers, not just in purchasing, but also in  calling for change, and calling for real action to be taken on  environmental issues such as climate change,&quot; says Cummins.
