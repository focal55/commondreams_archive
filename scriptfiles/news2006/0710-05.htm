<p>WASHINGTON - July 10 - In a week of actions starting on Monday, July 10, thousands of nurses, construction workers, miners and other workers will march to regional Labor Board offices and worksites to demand that they not be denied their worker rights and union protections. This is the first time that such a set of concerted actions has focused on the Bush Labor Board’s decisions. 

<p>The workers have their eyes on three cases currently pending at the NLRB that are often referred to as the “Kentucky River” cases. By broadening the legal definition of “supervisor,” these cases significantly strip workers of their existing contract protections and deny even more their right to organize reversing decades of worker protections. At stake are collective bargaining rights for hundreds of thousands of workers who could be reclassified as supervisors and therefore not eligible for union protection under federal law. 

<p>“At a time when America isn’t working the way it should for working people, the implications of losing union protections run deep for them,” said AFL-CIO Organizing Director Stewart Acuff. He points out that if workers lose their protections as “employees” under federal law, they may be fired or otherwise disciplined for union activity. They’ll lose the freedom to choose to join or remain a member of a union. And they will lose their ability to have a voice on the job. 

<p>In recent decisions, the Bush-appointed National Labor Relations Board has taken away workers’ protections and workers’ rights, including the rights of disabled workers, temporary employees and graduate employees. 

<p>The nurses at the rallies will say that union membership provides a voice on the job and the protections needed to be effective patient advocates. “A nurse with a union works with confidence to make tough calls and be a strong patient advocate on the hospital floor,” said Margaret Shanks, RN, from the Children's National Medical Center who is represented by DCNA/UAN. “Strong patient advocates need a strong voice to stand up to those who put the bottom line before patient care.” 

<p>Even foremen on construction jobs who work with a team of workers could lose their union rights under a broad definition of “supervisor.” That means thousands of painters, welders, sheet metal workers, plumbers, electricians and others could lose their right to be in a union.
