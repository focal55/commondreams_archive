<p>MINNEAPOLIS, Minnesota - June 15 - 
<p><b>WHAT:            <br>
</b>Briefing to introduce the new Institute for Energy and Environmental Research (IEER) publication, Insurmountable Risks: The Dangers of Using Nuclear Power to Combat Global Climate Change, the first full-length book to detail the risks associated with reviving the nuclear industry as part of efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  
 
<p><b>WHO:              <br>
</b>Dr. Brice Smith, Senior Scientist at IEER and author of Insurmountable Risks, holds a Ph.D. in physics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He has authored or coauthored works on nuclear waste management, uranium enrichment technologies, and the economics of wind power
 
                        <br>
<br>
Dr. Arjun Makhijani, president of IEER, holds a Ph.D. in engineering from the University of California at Berkeley. He has produced many reports on nuclear issues over the past twenty-five years and is the principal author of the first study on energy conservation potential in the U.S. economy.

<p><b>WHEN:            <br>
</b>Tuesday, June 20, 2006 -- 9:30 am
 
<p><b>WHERE:          <br>
</b>Zenger Room, National Press Club, 529 14th Street, NW, Washington, DC
 
<p><b>WHY:              <br>
</b>Proponents increasingly argue that more nuclear reactors must be built and existing plants kept in operation to limit climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel combustion in generating electric power.  
 
<p>While nuclear power does emit lower levels of greenhouse gases than coal or natural gas fired plants, there is no lack of alternative low-carbon dioxide energy sources.  The important questions are the comparative costs among fuel sources and the associated environmental, health, and security impacts.  
 
<p>For nuclear power to make a meaningful contribution to reducing carbon dioxide emissions, 1,000 to 2,500 reactors would have to be online globally by mid-century.  Insurmountable Risks details the costs of nuclear power as a means of reducing carbon dioxide emissions, the potential for catastrophic accidents from opening reactors at the rate of one every one or two weeks, and the likelihood of proliferation and terrorist attacks from constructing such a large number of reactors.  Drs. Smith and Makhijani will also explain economically viable alternatives to avoid these serious vulnerabilities.
