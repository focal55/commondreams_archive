<p>WASHINGTON - June 28 - Earlier today, Citizens  for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) released an  ethics complaint against Rep. Charles Taylor (R-N.C.). CREW also  sent copies of the complaint to the Department of Justice, Public  Integrity Section and to the U.S. Attorney for the Western  District of North Carolina. Last fall, CREW named Rep. Taylor one  of the 13 most corrupt members of Congress.</p>
<p>   CREW is asking that a member of the House forward the  complaint against Rep. Taylor to the House Committee on Standards  of Official Conduct, better known as the House Ethics Committee.  CREW is not submitting the complaint to the Ethics Committee  directly because outside groups are barred from filing  complaints. The rules allow a member of the House to certify that  CREW's complaint has a good faith basis and forward the complaint  to the Ethics Committee, stating that the complaint merits the  Committee's consideration.</p>
<p>   Among other things, the complaint alleges that Rep. Taylor may  have engaged in the crimes of conspiracy to commit bank fraud,  bribery and honest services fraud. It also alleges that he  violated numerous House ethics rules including: the prohibition  on members from receiving anything of value from anyone seeking  official action from the House, the prohibition on conduct not  reflecting creditably on the House, and the prohibition on banned  fiduciary relationships. </p>
<p>   The conspiracy allegations stem from Rep. Taylor's long-time  friend and political supporter, Charles Cagle's 2001 guilty plea  to bank fraud for borrowing $1.3 million from Rep. Taylor's bank,  Blue Ridge Savings and Loan. Hayes C. Martin, the former  president of Blue Ridge and former treasurer for Rep. Taylor's  campaign committee, pleaded guilty to bank fraud for making the  loans to Cagle. Both Cagle and Martin stated that Rep. Taylor was  involved in making the fraudulent loans. Rep. Taylor's role in  the fraud was never investigated.</p>
<p>   CREW also alleges that by accepting campaign contributions  from General Electric in apparent direct exchange for support of  legislation delaying a clean-up of the Hudson River, and from the  Saginaw Chippewa Indian tribe in return for writing a letter with  Sen. Conrad Burns (R-Mont.) the Department of the Interior  requesting an appropriation for the tribe, Rep. Taylor may have  accepted a bribe and violated House rules prohibiting Members  from receiving anything of value from those seeking official  action and prohibiting the dispensation of special favors.</p>
<p>   Finally, the complaint alleges that by owning Blue Ridge  Savings and Loan and a Russian bank, the Commercial Bank of  Ivanovo, Rep. Taylor is violating House rules prohibiting members  from providing services involving fiduciary relationships.</p>
<p>   CREW's Executive Director Melanie Sloan stated, "It is past  time for the House Committee on Standards of Official Conduct to  investigate whether Rep. Taylor's role as bank owner conflicts  with his role as a member of Congress and whether he has used his  official position for his financial benefit." Sloan continued,  "In addition, the Department of Justice should investigate why  the U.S. Attorney for the Western District of North Carolina  never investigated Rep. Taylor's role in the Cagle loans. It  appears that Rep. Taylor avoided indictment in that case because  he is a powerful Member of Congress. The Department of Justice  has stated that investigating public corruption is a priority.  This case gives the Department a chance to stand behind its  words." </p>
