<p>WASHINGTON - April 19 - This Earth Day, April  22, World Wildlife Fund (WWF) -- the largest conservation  organization in the world -- challenges everyone to try some of  these simple actions that can make a big difference. </p>
<p>   1. Don't leave the water running. Turn off the water when  brushing your teeth or washing the car.  Fresh water is one of  our most precious natural resources. </p>
<p>   2. Flick off the light when you leave the room. Power plants  burn fuels to create energy for your light bulb. Burning fuel  makes smog that pollutes the air and adds to global warming. The  less energy you use the less they need to make.  Plus you'll save  on your energy bill. </p>
<p>   3. Print on both sides of the page at work. It's easy to  change your printer settings -- you'll use half the paper and  save trees. </p>
<p>   4. Wash your clothes in warm or cold water. It works just as  well as hot in your washing machine and cuts back on energy use.</p>
<p>   5. Ditch the paper cups. Bring in a glass to keep at work  instead of using the paper ones by the water cooler. </p>
<p>   6. Use the right settings on your appliances. Many appliances,  like your dishwasher and refrigerator, come with energy-saving  settings. Make sure they're turned on. </p>
<p>   7. Turn off your computer at the end of the day. A monitor  left on overnight uses enough energy to print 5,300 copies. </p>
<p>   8. Give your loose change to an environmental charity. After  checkout at the supermarket, instead of tossing the coins into  your pocket drop them into a Coinstar Center(r) to donate to WWF.  Just select the &quot;donate&quot; option from the menu and choose WWF as  the charity. There's probably a machine right in the store so  it's an easy stop on your way out.  </p>
<p>   9. Pay attention to labels. Buy paper items with the  &quot;recycled&quot; emblem over the ones without.  Also, look for the  Energy Star symbol when buying new appliances.  </p>
<p>   10. Sign up for an e-newsletter. Get updates on environmental  issues and solutions emailed to you and glance through at your  leisure. The WWF e-newsletter is easy to sign up for and comes  out once a month, so it won't crowd your inbox.
