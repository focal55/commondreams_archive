<p> WASHINGTON - June 15 - MoveOn members responded overnight with an outpouring of contributions to extend a TV ad buy critical of U.S. Representative Thelma Drake (R, VA-2) in the wake of nationally coordinated GOP pressure on TV stations to censor ads critical of Republican incumbents. 

 

<p>Cox Cable TV in Virginia Beach VA took down the ad, but other stations continue to run it. Cox executives have so far refused to explain what they found objectionable in the ad, but according to Federal Election Commission records, the company’s spokesperson and one of its top executives are also Drake campaign contributors.

 

<p>The Republican effort seeks to protect vulnerable GOP House members by censoring a series of damaging TV ads linking those members to charges of corruption.  The most recent MoveOn.org Political Action ad accuses four House Republicans – Representatives Drake, Chocola, Pryce and Nancy Johnson--of voting to protect war profiteers like Halliburton while accepting campaign contributions from defense contractors, at a time when many of our troops lacked body armor.  

 

<p>“When the GOP doesn’t want you to hear about corruption in their own party and their buddies at Halliburton, they will go to any length to have the truth silenced,” said Eli Pariser.  “They are running a campaign of intimidation against American democracy and as our members have clearly shown, we are ready to fight back.”

 

<p>MoveOn officials have obtained virtually identical letters sent by Republican candidates to TV stations in three states threatening legal action for airing MoveOn TV ads.  

 

<p>On June 9th the RNC released a district by district “Fact Sheet” detailing local media coverage and suggested talking points tailored to counter the MoveOn ads, revealing their strategy of coordinated intimidation. 

 

<p>Below is a sample of two letters sent from Representatives Chocola and Drake:

 

<p><b>Chocola for Congress: </b>These ads attack Congressman Chocola personally for what MoveOn.org claims to be a variety of improprieties and in particular seek to cast him in a false light by accusing him being “caught red-handed.” These ads are reckless, malicious and false, casting Mr. Chocola in a false light by accusing him of unsubstantiated criminal conduct. We also believe the republication of theses allegations by your organization of these ads knowing, as outline below, of the false nature of these ads subjects your organization to the same potential liability for defamation as MoveOn.org.

 

<p><b>Drake for Congress:</b> These ads attack Congressman Drake personally for what MoveOn.org claims to be a variety of improprieties and in particular seek to cast him in a false light by accusing her being “caught red-handed.” The newest ad attacks Congresswoman Drake personally for allegedly protecting war profiteers and goes on to implicitly accuse the Congresswoman of taking bribes. These ads are reckless, malicious and false, casting Ms. Drake in a false light by accusing him of unsubstantiated criminal conduct. We also believe the republication of theses allegations by your organization of these ads knowing, as outline below, of the false nature of these ads subjects your organization to the same potential liability for defamation as MoveOn.org.

 

<p>New Federal Elections Commission (FEC) data also point to conflict of interest concerns regarding several Time Warner and Cox executives who contributed to GOP candidates, including those targeted by the ads.

 

<p>Members of MoveOn.org Political Action confronted Cox Cable and Time Warner executives yesterday at the company’s headquarters for censoring the latest in a series of “Caught Red-Handed” TV ads that accuse Representatives Thelma Drake and Deborah Pryce of voting to protect defense contractors like Halliburton that defrauded the US military.  To view a copy of the ad, visit www.moveon.org.

 

<p>“Let me get this straight:  First, the GOP gets exposed for protecting war profiteers like Halliburton and now executives at Cox and Time Warner – who censored our TV ads -  are exposed giving money to the GOP…if that isn’t the definition of political back-scratching, I don’t know what is,” said Eli Pariser, Executive Director of MoveOn Political Action.

 

<p>MoveOn representatives hand delivered complaints filed with the local franchising authorities and the Federal Communications Commission Enforcement Bureau to the company executives today.

 

<p>Since 2002, recent Cox VP and Hampton Roads manager, Franklin R. Bowers, has contributed   $5,500.00 to Drake and other Virginia GOP candidates.  Currently, Bowers is President of Virginia Tel-Com, a Cox subsidiary.  

 

<p>New Federal Election Commission records show that a second Cox official, company spokesman Tom Prevette, also contributed $1,250 to Drake and other Republican campaigns.  

 

<p>In Ohio, since 1995, Time Warner Columbus Division President Rhonda Fraas and former President Terry O’Connell have contributed $2,625.00 to GOP candidates.  

 

<p>Local Virginia Beach resident and MoveOn member Guy Sturino expressed disappointment in the decision by Cox to pull the ad.  “This ad was made possible by MoveOn’s members – including the 3,100 in Representative Drake’s district who just want to get the truth out,” said Sturino.  “There’s enough corruption in Congress and the last thing we need is for Cox executives to assist it.”
