<p>WASHINGTON - July 26 - <SPAN>Today the Government Accountability Office released a report that sharply criticizes the Environmental Protection Agency's record on air toxics control.&nbsp; The report concludes, in particular, that EPA has failed to take action on scores of specific pollution control measures that the Clean Air Act required the agency to complete several years ago. <A

<p>For over a decade, Earthjustice has represented a variety of environmental, public health and community groups in litigation challenging EPA's failure to implement the Clean Air Act's air toxics provisions.  The following is a statement by Earthjustice attorney James Pew:

<p>"The GAO report reflects the sad reality that this EPA is unwilling to control the health risks presented by toxic air emissions.  It confirms EPA has left many categories of smaller industrial sources entirely uncontrolled, even though the agency has acknowledged these sources to be the worst contributors to America's toxic urban air.  EPA's own studies show that the uncontrolled pollution from these sources create unacceptable risks of cancer and other disease.

<p>"The GAO report also confirms EPA's striking disregard for the authority of Congress.  In 1990, Congress passed a law requiring EPA to set standards controlling urban toxic pollution within ten years, by November 15, 2000.  More than 75 percent of these standards have yet to be issued.  Thanks to EPA's neglect, millions of Americans are exposed to high levels of risk for cancer and other disease that should have been abated years ago.

<p>"The GAO report states the obvious: EPA needs to set priorities, establish timelines, and develop a plan to get adequate funding for air toxics control.  But EPA also needs to spend taxpayer dollars that Congress entrusts to it on the tasks that Congress set.  Amazingly, while EPA has neglected Congressional mandates to address air toxics, the agency has spent resources freely on entirely discretionary activities that do nothing whatsoever to benefit public health or the environment.  A list of twelve examples is attached.  By diverting taxpayer dollars away from the tasks that Congress set and toward the current administration's anti-environmental agenda, EPA has betrayed the public trust.  It is deplorable that Americans will be sickened literally as well as figuratively by this agency's conduct."
