<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --> NEW YORK - September 20 - Spending on television advertising more than tripled in the 
final week of Washington’s contentious Supreme Court campaigns, making it second 
only to Alabama as the costliest judicial air war in the nation so far this 
year, said two national watchdog groups. By September 17 three interest groups 
had spent a total of $791,980 on TV ads. A week earlier, spending on television 
ads had amounted to $227,723. 
<P>All of the television advertising appeared in the contentious campaign 
between Chief Justice Gerry Alexander and challenger John Groen, though neither 
candidate’s campaign committee paid for the television ads. Instead, interest 
groups dueled on the air, with groups supporting Groen and opposing Alexander 
outspending the opposition more than four to one. "It’s Time for a Change"-- a 
political action committee affiliated with the Building Industry Association of 
Washington-- and "Americans Tired of Lawsuit Abuse"-- a national interest group 
based in Virginia-- spent a total of $638,907 to run three television ads 
attacking Alexander. On the other side, "Citizens to Uphold the Constitution"-- 
a coalition of labor, environmental, tribal, and trial lawyers-- spent $153,073 
to run one ad opposing Groen.</P>
<P>"Given that three special interest groups, rather than the candidates, served 
as the chief messengers of the campaign on television, it is little surprise 
that the tone and tenor of Washington’s Supreme Court races reached a new low," 
said James Sample, Associate Counsel at the Brennan Center for Justice. 
Washington’s 2004 Supreme Court election featured only $66,127 in television 
advertising. That advertising, which was paid for by a candidate’s campaign, was 
positive in tone – a sharp contrast to 2006.</P>
<P>One ad run by "It’s Time for a Change" accused Alexander of inappropriately 
supporting Justice Bobbe Bridge after she was arrested for drunk driving. The 
implication was that Alexander was more interested in protecting a friend than 
in upholding justice. </P>
<P>Another ad sponsored by "Americans Tired of Lawsuit Abuse" featured a woman 
whose son was murdered saying, "The <I>Andress</I> decision let my son’s killer 
walk free…..if Justice Alexander hadn’t voted for this decision, this wouldn’t 
have happened." The ad did not mention that four other justices voted with 
Alexander.</P>
<P>An ad opposing Groen, sponsored by "Citizens to Uphold the Constitution," 
says, "John Groen and far right extremists are trying to buy our Supreme Court. 
So extreme they gut protections for our clean air and water. They oppose stem 
cell research and a woman’s right to choose." Groen said he has never taken a 
position on any of the issues mentioned.</P>
<P>"The kind of mudslinging we have seen in Washington has no place in any 
political race, but it certainly should not appear in a campaign for a seat on 
the state’s highest court," said Bert Brandenburg, executive director of Justice 
at Stake. "When political ads demand that courts answer to interest groups 
instead of being fair and impartial, public confidence in the judiciary is put 
at risk," he added. </P>
<P>This year Washington is second only to Alabama in television spending on 
Supreme Court races. Leading up to the Alabama Republican primary in June, six 
candidates and one interest group spent a total of almost $2.7 million on 
television advertising. Television advertising for Alabama’s general election 
began last week, when challenger Sue Bell Cobb took to the airwaves. </P>
