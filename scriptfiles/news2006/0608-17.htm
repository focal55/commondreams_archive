<p>Two women peace prize winners—Jody Williams from the United States and Shirin Ebadi from Iran — are this week leading a delegation of 10 civil society organizations from both countries. The organizations work on children’s rights, landmines, nuclear power, human rights, women and disarmament issues. They will meet with government representatives of the IAEA Board of Governors and IAEA officials.  They will also promote greater exchange between Iranian and U.S. non-governmental organizations. 

 

<p>Olson, from NIRS, and Woods, from IPS, are participating in the trip as are delegates from the Feminist Majority Foundation, American Friends Service Committee, Global Fund for Women, Women’s International League for Peace and Freedom and Greenpeace International. Williams, Olson and Woods will be available to discuss the outcomes of these meetings at the press conference.

 

<p>Ebadi and Williams belong to the Nobel Women’s Initiative, a new project of women Nobel Peace Prize Laureates that includes: Jody Williams (U.S. 1997), Shirin Ebadi (Iran, 2003), Wangari Maathai (Kenya, 2004), Rigoberta Menchu Tum (Guatemala, 1992) and Betty Williams (Ireland, 1976).

 

<p>Williams was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in recognition of her work with the International Campaign to Ban Landmines to eliminate anti-personnel landmines.  Ebadi, a lawyer, received the award for her tireless efforts to promote human rights, in particular, the rights of women, children, and political prisoners in Iran.
