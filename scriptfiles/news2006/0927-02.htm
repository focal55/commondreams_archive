<p>WASHINGTON - September 27 - The following are  statements on California's new law to reduce heat-trapping  emissions:</p>
<p>   &quot;The ice is melting on U.S. global warming policy. California  is thawing the freeze on climate action, casting the White House  adrift. Today, California joins the rest of the industrialized  world in the fight against global warming. Of course, the state  has only just reached the starting line. The next few years will  be California's opportunity to develop a precedent-setting  program to reduce emissions and grow the economy. Strong policies  will be measured by real reductions, incentives for innovation,  and cross-border collaboration.&quot;</p>
<p>   -- Jason Mark, California Director, Union of Concerned  Scientists</p>
<p>   &quot;This law restores our faith that sound science can spur  strong policies. California has a lot to lose from global warming  and a lot to gain from climate action. Policymakers are heeding  the call to action from climate scientists. Scientists throughout  the state have linked global warming to poorer air quality, a  sharp rise in extreme heat, a less reliable water supply, more  dangerous wildfires, rising sea levels, and expanding risks to  agriculture. The state must continue its scientific research  program to identify the risks that can be avoided and help us  prepare for the changes that are already underway.&quot;</p>
<p>   -- Dr. Amy Lynd Luers, Climate Impacts Scientist, Union of  Concerned Scientists</p>
