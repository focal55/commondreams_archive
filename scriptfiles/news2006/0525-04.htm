<p>WASHINGTON - May 25 - Congressman Dennis J. Kucinich (D-OH) gave the following speech today on the House floor during debate on legislation to open up Alaska’s Artic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) to drilling
<p>“In the book of Genesis, Esau, hungry believing he was about to die, sold his birthright to Jacob for a pot of red stew.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“The Alaska National Wildlife Refuge is the birthright of the G’witchen tribe as well as a national treasure of natural beauty.&nbsp; Are we, like Esau, about to sell our birthright to the corporations for a mess of oily pottage</p>
<p>“Are we ready to despoil our natural heritage in search of liquid fool’s gold</p>
<p>“It is time for new thinking.&nbsp; Instead of the oil companies taking over ANWR for drilling, we ought to be talking about taking over the oil companies.&nbsp; They have gouged the American people.&nbsp; They control our politics.&nbsp; They have ignored the growing global environmental crisis. The lust for oil has put us on a path to war. </p>
<p>&nbsp;“It is time for new thinking.&nbsp; We should be talking about a windfall profits tax, breaking up the oil monopolies, or even taking over the oil companies, not sacrificing ANWR.</p>
<p>“Esau thought his birthright didn’t mean much.&nbsp; Will we, like Esau, come to regret that we have never claimed our right to control over our own natural resources, our own environment, our own nation?”</p>
