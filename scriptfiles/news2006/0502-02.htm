<p>WASHINGTON - May 2 - For the fourth year,  Parents, Families and Friends of Lesbians and Gays (PFLAG)  members will take to Capitol Hill with family photos in hand as  part of their Bringing the Message Home campaign to meet with  legislators to lobby them for support on legislation that  promotes equality for their gay, lesbian, bisexual and  transgender (GLBT) loved ones and to fight the Federal Marriage  Amendment. </p>
<p>   They will also use the opportunity to honor three members of  Congress -- Rep. Barney Frank (D-Mass.), Rep. Tammy Baldwin (D- Wis.) and retiring Rep. Jim Kolbe (R-Ariz.) - for their courage  to be out and open legislators. </p>
<p>   &quot;This event is a time for elected officials - many of whom are  facing a vote on June 5 on the discriminatory Federal Marriage  Amendment - to see the faces of their constituents and see in a  very real way that we are about family values, too,&quot; said Jody M.  Huckaby, PFLAG's executive director. &quot;One of our core family  values is simple, basic equality for all of our family members,  and we want our legislators to understand what it means. That's  what this day is about.&quot; </p>
<p>   PFLAG members will be using the fourth edition of PFLAG's  Bringing the Message Home campaign toolkit, a guide to some of  the organization's key issues in real-world terms. Legislation  included in the 2006 edition includes bills related to marriage  equality, hate crimes, the military, discrimination in the  workplace, safe schools, and immigration. </p>
<p>   Collectively, PFLAGers will make more than 50 visits during  the day on May 4. Meanwhile, PFLAG members nationwide are  scheduling in-district lobby visits as part of the campaign that  spans from Mother's Day to Father's Day, adding hundreds of  additional meetings with legislators to the list. </p>
<p>   Following the Lobby Day event, PFLAG is hosting a Capitol Hill  reception to honor three openly gay and lesbian members of  congress for their courage. They include Rep. Barney Frank (D- MA), Rep. Tammy Baldwin (D-WI) and Jim Kolbe (R-AR). </p>
<p>   &quot;These legislators have set a tremendous example for all  Americans through their basic honesty and personal integrity and  they serve as powerful role models, particularly for our GLBT  young people. By virtue of being out, they send a message to  everyone that GLBT people are everywhere, come from every kind of  city and region, represent different political parties, and take  on different issues, but all united for equality.&quot; </p>
