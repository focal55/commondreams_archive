<p>WASHINGTON - January 24 - The American Civil Liberties Union today expressed its 
disappointment with the party-line approval of the nomination of Judge Samuel A. 
Alito, Jr. to be the new associate justice on the Supreme Court, and urged the 
full Senate to reject his confirmation. </P>
<P>The following can be attributed to Caroline Fredrickson, Director of the ACLU 
Washington Legislative Office:</P><P>"The American people deserve a nominee whose loyalty lies with the 
Constitution and not the whims of the president. Judge Alito&#8217;s record has shown 
an alarming and undue deference to executive powers. His legal and judicial 
philosophy shows a jurist who is all too willing to acquiesce to the harmful, 
and possibly illegal, demands of an executive branch set on extending its reach 
and power.</P><P>"At a time when the president and his surrogates are claiming unprecedented 
authority to break the rules, the nation&#8217;s highest court must uphold our 
fundamental civil liberties and freedoms, and recognize and sustain the balance 
of powers essential to our government. Judge Alito would upset that balance, to 
the detriment of our personal freedoms and privacy.<!-- #EndEditable -->
