<p>WASHINGTON - November 3 - From today's headlines,  says gay activist Mike Rogers, &quot;it seems quite possible that  closeted gay men have been holding the top jobs in both the anti- gay Republican party and the anti-gay national evangelical  Christian movement.&quot; 
<p>   It was announced Thursday that Rev. Ted Haggard of Colorado  Springs, Colo., president of the 30 million-member National  Association of Evangelicals and a leader in the get-out-the-vote  effort for Republicans, has resigned his national post, after a  male prostitute alleged on Denver television that Haggard  repeatedly paid him for gay sex for three years.</p>

<p>   Rogers, who has spent years documenting and exposing the  hypocrisy of closeted gay politicians, today called on another  Colorado Springs-based evangelical leader, James Dobson of Focus  on the Family, to join him in investigating whether the leaders  involved have been truthful and to demand new answers from them.</p>
<p>   &quot;It is time for everyone in America to realize that the two  leading anti-gay forces in America -- the Republican National  Committee and the National Association of Evangelicals -- could  quite possibly have been under the leadership of closeted gay men  themselves,&quot; Rogers said.</p>
<p>   Rogers, the nation's top gay activist blogger and president of  the group Proud of Who We Are -- <a href="http://releases.usnewswire.com/redir.asp?ReleaseID=75648&Link=http://www.proudofwhoweare.org">http://www.proudofwhoweare.org</a> - - on Tuesday released what has become one of the most-watched  videos on YouTube, an ad parody about the hypocrisy of Republican  National Committee Ken Mehlman. </p>
<p>   Mehlman remains on the job marshalling evangelicals in the  GOP's vaunted &quot;72-hour strategy&quot; to drive right-wing voter  turnout against the &quot;pro-homosexual agenda,&quot; although Mehlman  deflected a question about his own sexual identity as recently as  10 days ago on camera.</p>

<p>   Also on Rogers' blog -- <a href="http://releases.usnewswire.com/redir.asp?ReleaseID=75648&Link=http://www.blogActive.com">http://www.blogActive.com</a> -- is the  video of his question to Mehlman, at a Capitol Hill fundraiser on  Oct. 23, about whether Mehlman's conflicting answers about his  sexual identity might affect social conservatives' turnout at the  polls. </p>
<p>   Awareness of the potential political impact is growing in the  mainstream media. On MSNBC's Decision 2006 program Wednesday,  political analyst Sascha Burns said, &quot;the evangelicals have  started to think that the reason their social agenda's gotten  blocked ... is because of radical gay Republicans at the top of  the party.&quot; See <a href="http://releases.usnewswire.com/redir.asp?ReleaseID=75648&Link=http://www.youtube.com/watch?vequalmTnjaar4jak">http://www.youtube.com/watch?vequalmTnjaar4jak</a></p>
<p>   The Christian Defense Coalition put out a news release  Wednesday in which its director, Rev. Patrick J. Mooney states,  &quot;If Republicans lose the House or Senate, they only have  themselves to blame. They have failed to energize and empower  faith and value voters which provide a critical base of support  for the Republican Party. Many evangelicals I have talked with  feel used and taken for granted by the Republican Party. Their  feeling is the Republican Party courts them during elections and  then abandons and ignores them after the election is over.&quot; See  <a href="http://releases.usnewswire.com/redir.asp?ReleaseID=75648&Link=http://www.christiannewswire.com/news/197951383.html">http://www.christiannewswire.com/news/197951383.html</a></p>

<p>   The video produced by Rogers this week parodies Mehlman's  hypocrisy and his role in the NRC's now-notorious &quot;call me&quot; ad  against Rep. Harold Ford, the Democratic candidate for Senate in  Tennessee. The parody ad features a young man in a tank top  inviting Mehlman to &quot;call me.&quot; By Wednesday morning, a day after  its release, it was the No. 4 Top-Rated Video among all videos on  YouTube. See <a href="http://releases.usnewswire.com/redir.asp?ReleaseID=75648&Link=http://www.youtube.com/watch?vequalaxJ67DOHpXQ">http://www.youtube.com/watch?vequalaxJ67DOHpXQ</a></p>
<p>   The website of the National Association of Evangelicals that  Haggard headed until Thursday says, &quot;homosexual activity, like  adulterous relationships, is clearly condemned in the  Scriptures...an abomination...a degrading and unnatural  passion...a sin that, if persisted in, brings grave consequences  in this life and excludes one from the Kingdom of God.&quot; <a href="http://www.nae.net/index.cfm?FUSEACTIONequaleditor.page&pageIDequ%20al303&IDCategoryequal8">Click here.</a> </p>

<p>   It also claims that, &quot;the degradation of moral absolutes has  led to recent debates over same-sex marriage.&quot; Haggard has been a  vocal backer of a proposed amendment to the Colorado constitution  that defines marriage as between one man and one woman, on the  ballot next Tuesday. He resigned his national position Thursday  afternoon, and said he would take a leave from pastoring his  14,000-member megachurch in Colorado Springs.</p>
