<p>NEW YORK  - July 10 -  Documents obtained by the 
American Civil Liberties Union under the 
Freedom of Information Act 
show that military commanders in Afghanistan 
requested in January 2003 
that the Defense Department clarify which 
interrogation methods could 
be used against prisoners held by U.S. forces, but 
that senior Defense 
Department officials ignored the request.&nbsp; The ACLU 
released some 
of the government documents last week and, after review, released 
the 
remainder today.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <BR>
&nbsp;<BR>"It is the 
Defense Desaid Jameel 
Jaffer, an ACLU 
attorney.&nbsp; "But as these documents show, the Defense Department allowed abusive interrogation practices to flopartment's responsibility to ensure that prisoners are 
treated 
humanely, as the Geneva Conventions require," urish."<BR>
&nbsp;<BR>The documents, which 
include the report of Vice 
Admiral Albert T. Church, who was tapped to conduct a 
comprehensive 
review of Defense Department interrogation operations, reveal new 

details in how several systemic failures in the chain of command 
manifested 
themselves, including:<BR>&nbsp;<BR><STRONG>Improvised 
Interrogation and "Silence as 
Consent"</STRONG><BR>&nbsp;<BR>According 
to the Church report, military commanders in 
Afghanistan sought 
clarification from United States Central Command (Centcom) 
and the 
Joint Chiefs of Staff, describing interrogation techniques then being 

employed and recommending that the techniques be approved as official 
policy in 
Afghanistan.&nbsp; <BR>&nbsp;<BR>Some of the techniques in 
the request had been 
approved by the Secretary of Defense exclusively 
for use at Guant&#225;namo; some had 
since been rescinded altogether.&nbsp; 
When senior officials failed to respond 
as to whether those techniques 
were appropriate, the ground command in 
Afghanistan subsequently 
adopted their own techniques as policy on the theory 
that "silence is 
consent."&nbsp; <BR>&nbsp;<BR><STRONG>Unclear Guidelines As to What 

Constitutes "Sleep Deprivation"</STRONG> <BR>&nbsp;<BR>According to a 
report by Brigadier 
General Richard Formica, as late as May 2004 
Coalition Joint Task Force-7 was 
operating under a set of rules that 
had been approved by Gen. Sanchez in 
September of 2003, but rescinded a 
month later.&nbsp; The September order 
included approval of the use of 
military dogs, stress positions, sleep 
adjustment and environmental 
manipulation.&nbsp; All of these techniques were 
rescinded in an 
October memo.&nbsp; <BR>&nbsp;<BR>The new documents reveal that 
an 
officer on the ground tried to confirm the policy in February 2004, asking of 
the September Sanchez memo "Can you verify that this is a valid, signed 
policy? 
If not, can you send me (or steer me toward) the current 
policy?" The officer 
received a reply that consisted of a copy of the 
signed September memo and no 
mention of the October memo.&nbsp; It 
wasn't until May 21, 2004 that, after some 
media attention, "anyone in 
[the unit] became aware that the 14 Sep 03 policy 
had been superceded." 
Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld later approved "sleep 
adjustment" but not 
"sleep deprivation," which was defined as "keeping detainee 
awake for 
more than 16 hours or allowing a detainee to rest briefly and then 

repeatedly awakening him, not to exceed four days in 

succession."
<P></P>

<UL><LI>One commander at Guant&#225;namo came up with his own 
definition of 
sleep deprivation&nbsp; - "I define 'sleep deprivation' as keeping 
a 
detainee awake continuously for five or six day's [sic] straight."</LI><LI>
Based on the advice of military lawyers and an United States Army Ranger 
course 
in which soldiers were subjected to days that lasted for 20 
hours, a unit devised 
its own policy on how long detainees could be 
interrogated. "If it was okay to 
subject our soldiers to twenty-hour 
days, then in our mind's [sic] it was okay 
to subject the terrorists to 
twenty-hour interrogations."</LI><LI>
In at least one instance, a 
detainee was interrogated for 20 hours 
every day for almost two months.</LI></UL>
<P><STRONG>Lack of Guidelines and Enforcement</STRONG> <BR>&nbsp;<BR>Evidence in 
the 
Church Report also suggests that in developing techniques, 
interrogators 
interpreted the rules extremely broadly.&nbsp; In 
particular, Alpha Company, 
519th MI Battalion developed a variety of 
techniques that went well beyond those 
authorized.&nbsp; Some of these 
techniques, including stress positions, were 
similar to those 
authorized by the Secretary of Defense in December 2002 for use 
at 
Guant&#225;namo.&nbsp; Loopholes in the language and lack of oversight allowed 
these practices to continue.&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;</P>
<UL><LI>In an investigation in which Marines 
were ordered by a superior 
officer to strip detainees and take their money, an 
investigator stated 
that, "the alleged conduct is a pattern of abuse of 
detainees in direct 
contravention to the Marine policy of 'No Better Friend, no 
worse 
enemy,' as well as the law of war. A Senior Naval Officer's conduct of 

publicly humiliating these Iraqis clearly jeopardized the Battalion's 
mission 
and the Battalion's standing with the public....these acts 
could have been a 
"tipping point" resulting in hostility against 
coalition forces."</LI><LI>
A detainee 
named Awayed Wanas Jabar died in U.S. custody in Iraq 
after having his legs tied 
to the bars of a window and a strap of 
engineer tape tied tightly around his 
midsection. A preliminary inquiry 
stated that, "His position resembled that of a 
person who had been 
crucified." According to one Marine, the detainee seemed 
"exhausted, 
with his entire bodyweight appearing to be supported by the strap 

around his midsection."&nbsp; Jabar remained in that position for at 
least an 
hour and a half and died approximately 15 minutes after the 
tape was cut.&nbsp; 
Because no autopsy was conducted, an investigation 
was unable to conclude if the 
cause of death was 
asphyxia.&nbsp;&nbsp;</LI></UL>

<P>The Church Report also identified several cases in which medical personnel 
failed to act after witnessing behavior that should have led them to 
suspect 
detainee abuse. The report found two cases where military 
physicians in Bagram 
reported no evidence of trauma when subsequent 
autopsies found severe soft 
tissue injuries.&nbsp; In one instance in 
Iraq, military physicians documented 
concerns about possible detainee 
abuse in a memorandum dated six months after 
the detainee's 
death.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>"These documents further confirm that 
systemic 
command failures led to the widespread abuse of detainees held in U.S. 

custody abroad," said ACLU staff attorney Amrit Singh.&nbsp; "Only an 
independent investigation into detainee abuse can be trusted to hold 
relevant 
officials accountable for such failures."<BR>&nbsp;<BR>The 
full Church Report, 
along with other documents released to the ACLU, is
