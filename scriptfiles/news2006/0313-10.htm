<p>WASHINGTON - March 13 - In the aftermath of the 
African Union (AU) Peace & Security Council meeting on Darfur last 
Friday, Africa Action today expressed its deep concern regarding the 
ongoing failure of the international community to take steps to address 
the immediate security needs on the ground in western Sudan. As the 
genocide continues in Darfur, Africa Action asserts that the inadequacy 
of U.S. and international efforts to respond to this crisis contributed 
to the AU's decision to merely extend its own beleaguered operation in 
that region, and reveals a deep failure to assert the global 
responsibility to protect the people of Darfur.

<p>Salih Booker, Executive Director of Africa Action, said today, "By 
deferring to the Government of Sudan on the timing and the terms of a UN 
operation in Darfur, the African Union and the larger international 
community are essentially granting veto power to the very author of this 
genocide. It is deeply disturbing to consider the degree to which this 
dynamic, and Khartoum's increasing audacity, have been facilitated by 
Washington's relationship with the government of Sudan and by the 
successive failures of the international community to hold Khartoum 
accountable for the crisis in Darfur."

<p>Africa Action notes that the Communique from Friday's AU meeting 
expressed support "in principle" for a transition from its own mission 
in Darfur to a United Nations (UN) peacekeeping operation, essentially 
reiterating its January statement to the same effect, but agreeing on no 
firm plan for such a transition nor on immediate measures to protect the 
people of Darfur. For the last two years, the AU mission in Darfur has 
lacked the capacity, the troop strength and the mandate to stop the 
genocide, and there are no indications that this will change in the 
coming months.

<p>Ann-Louise Colgan, Director of Policy Analysis & Communications at 
Africa Action, said today, "The recent consensus around the need for a 
robust international protection force in Darfur cannot be trumped by the 
manipulations of the government of Sudan. The U.S. and the international 
community must prioritize the people of Darfur, and must expend every 
effort to overcome the obstacles to a UN force on an urgent basis, 
asserting the responsibility to protect and establishing the precedent 
that genocide will not be tolerated."

<p>Marie Clarke Brill, Director of Public Education & Mobilization at 
Africa Action, said today, "The need for international action to protect 
the people of Darfur is clear, and this continues to be a rallying 
principle for growing numbers of Americans. The pressure of recent weeks 
and months has forced new action on Darfur but the only important 
measure of any new action is the level of protection it brings to the 
people of Darfur. Until the reality on the ground changes, people across 
the country will continue to assert this urgent priority."

<p>Africa Action notes the AU's focus on the importance of a peace 
agreement on Darfur being concluded in Abuja, Nigeria, where talks 
continue in their seventh round. But the organization notes that an 
international peacekeeping presence in Darfur cannot wait six months, 
and emphasizes that such a presence can enhance the possibility for such 
an agreement by maintaining the cease fire and establishing a climate of 
security in Darfur. Africa Action also notes the need for the United 
Nations to proceed as quickly as possible beyond the stage of 
contingency planning on Darfur toward a formal commitment to establish a 
peacekeeping presence in Darfur.
