<p>   An unprecedented series of indictments alleging war crimes and  crimes against humanity, in five separate areas, on moral,  political, and legal grounds, will be delivered by a citizens'  tribunal to President Bush at the front gate of the White House  this Tuesday, January 10th.</p>
<p>   Named in the indictments are: President of the United States  George W. Bush, Vice President Richard Cheney, Secretary of  Defense Donald Rumsfeld, U.S. Army Lieutenant General Ricardo  Sanchez, U.S. Army Major General Geoffrey Miller, Attorney  General Alberto Gonzales, et al.</p>
<p>   The indictments will be delivered to the White House by:  Retired CIA analyst Ray McGovern, authors William Blum and Larry  Everest, Code Pink, Mike Hersh (Progressive Democrats of  America/After Downing Street), Kevin Zeese (Director, Democracy  Rising; candidate for U.S. Senate in Maryland), Travis Morales  (World Can't Wait -- Drive Out the Bush Regime) and others TBA.</p>
<p>   A press conference will follow delivery of indictments, which  will also be delivered to the Department of Justice.</p>

<p>   The indictments result from preparatory work and testimony  presented in New York City in October 2005, before the  International Commission of Inquiry on Crimes Against Humanity  Committed by the Bush Administration which featured former UN  envoy to Iraq Denis Halliday, Guantanamo prisoners' lawyer  Michael Ratner, and former State Department officer Ann Wright.  The Commission's second tribunal will be held at Riverside Church  and the Columbia University Law School in New York, January 20- 22. Witnesses will include Brig. Gen. Janis Karpinski, former  British ambassador Craig Murray, and former arms inspector Scott  Ritter, among many more.   The indictments allege war crimes and  crimes against humanity authorized by the Bush Administration in  relation to:</p>
<p>   1) Wars of Aggression, particular reference to Iraq and  Afghanistan;</p>
<p>   2) Torture and Indefinite Detention;</p>
<p>   3) Destruction of the Global Environment, particular reference  to distortion of science and obstruction of international efforts  to stem global warming;</p>
<p>   4) Attacks on Global Public Health and Reproductive Rights,  particular reference to the potentially genocidal effects of  enforcing abstinence only, global gag rule, distortion of  science, and restriction of generic drugs; and</p>
<p>   5) Failure of Bush administration, despite foreknowledge, to  protect life during and after Hurricane Katrina.</p>

<p>   Appended to these indictments will be the demand for  investigation of the war crimes of Tony Blair and George Bush  submitted by prominent British citizens to the UN Secretary  General and the UK Attorney General.</p>
<p>   The commission was organized by the Not in Our Name Statement  of Conscience and is endorsed by: Center for Constitutional  Rights, National Lawyers Guild, After Downing Street.org and  others, including Former Sen.
