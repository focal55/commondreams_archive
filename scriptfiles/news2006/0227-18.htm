<p>AUSTIN, Texas - February 27 - Green Mountain Energy Company, one of the nation's leading retail providers of cleaner electricity products, announced today that the company is expanding its business with the launch of <a href="http://www.greenmountain.com/eMission">eMission Solutions</a> , a portfolio of carbon reduction services for commercial and institutional sector clients looking to improve their environmental position. <br />
<br />
“With climate change, high energy costs, environmental concerns and increased focus on sustainable business practices by institutional investors, customers and other stakeholders at the forefront of today’s global mind-set, businesses are increasingly looking for ways to reduce their impact on the environment,” said Gillan Taddune, chief environmental officer for Green Mountain Energy Company and head of the eMission Solutions division. “Our experience and relationships put us in a unique position to offer carbon management solutions designed for next generation businesses.”<br />
<br />
<b>eMission Solutions</b><br />
eMission Solutions includes a wide range of carbon reduction products and services including Renewable Energy Credits (RECs), forest sequestration projects, LEED consulting and other carbon reduction strategies. These products will allow companies to reduce their carbon footprint and offset the carbon emissions associated with business activities like transportation, production, electricity usage, and employee commuting and air travel.<br />
<br />
<b>Chicago Climate Exchange</b><br />
In support of this new initiative, Green Mountain Energy Company has recently joined the Chicago Climate Exchange (CCX), a voluntary, multi-sector market for reducing and trading greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. CCX represents the first legally binding commitment by a cross-section of North American corporations, municipalities and other institutions to establish a rules-based market for reducing all six greenhouse gases. CCX enables members to receive credit for reductions, and to buy and sell credits to determine the most cost-effective means of achieving emission reductions.<br />
<br />
Michael Walsh, senior vice president of Chicago Climate Exchange, said, “eMission Solutions is a great example of the creative environmental actions that can leverage CCX’s organized emission reduction market. We congratulate Green Mountain Energy on the launch of this entrepreneurial initiative.”<br />
 <br />
<b>American Forests</b><br />
In addition, Green Mountain Energy Company is expanding its ongoing partnership with American Forests to offer customers the opportunity to reduce their carbon footprint through supporting forest sequestration projects. Forests are an important part of climate change solutions because of their capacity to store, or “sequester”, carbon.<br />
<br />
"We have partnered with Green Mountain Energy Company for over five years on various projects and are excited to work together on this new initiative," said Deborah Gangloff, executive director, American Forests. "Together we will help companies realize the value of forest sequestration in their carbon reduction plans."<br />
<br />
<b>Leading by example</b><br />
Since its inception, Green Mountain Energy Company has worked to lead by example. As part of its corporate commitment to sustainable business practices, the company participates in the Environmental Protection Agency's "Climate Leaders Program" and, through a variety of projects, has taken the impressive step of making its business operations carbon neutral. The company is also a member of Ceres, a national network of investment funds, environmental organizations and other public interest groups working to advance environmental stewardship on the part of businesses. As a Ceres company, Green Mountain Energy has since 2000 published an annual report of its environmental practices. A copy of the most recent report can be found online at <a href="http://www.greenmountain.com/about/environment">www.greenmountain.com/about/environment</a>.<br />
