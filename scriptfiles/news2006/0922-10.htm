<p>WASHINGTON - September 22 - Statement by Tom Kiernan, President, National Parks Conservation Association

<p>National Parks Conservation Association (NPCA) President Tom Kiernan today hailed the Grand Teton Transportation EIS decision as a “studious, thoughtful, and visionary plan that leads with protecting park resources while providing for a future of exciting visitor opportunities to enjoy this magnificent park.”  

<p>“As national parks across the country are working to relieve traffic congestion while protecting park resources and ensuring enjoyable visitor experiences, this example at Grand Teton could easily serve as a model nationwide,” Kiernan stated. 

<p>“In the early stages of this EIS, NPCA suggested a more ambitious program for both pathways and transit than this decision today ultimately offers. Frankly, the park has done an excellent job of integrating good science and a thoughtful, learn-as-we-go approach into this new alternative and we are supportive of this scaled-back but substantive and significant proposal,” Kiernan said.   

<p>Kiernan commended the “leadership of Senator Thomas in encouraging a thoughtful community discussion and providing congressional support for a sound, forward-looking proposal. Craig Thomas is the national congressional leader looking to preserve our parks for the future; from the beginning the senator has encouraged the park and the community to work together to generate a plan that protects Grand Teton and provides visitors and the local community with new options for enjoying the park.”   

<p>"Today the National Park Service has done well for the park, the community and the country by delivering a plan that will safely welcome hikers, bikers, and parents with strollers to Grand Teton National Park for generations to come. They’ve listened to public concerns, gathered great information, and this thoughtful, balanced proposal by park professionals shows that the Park Service is planning with the future of the parks in mind," Kiernan concluded.
