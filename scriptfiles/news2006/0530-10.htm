<p>WASHINGTON - May 30 - The American Civil Liberties Union today applauded House 
Judiciary Committee Chairman F. James Sensenbrenner (R-WI) for holding a hearing 
to examine the constitutionality of the recent search of the Capitola Hill 
office of Congressman William Jefferson (D-LA) by federal agents, and renewed 
its call for the committee to hold hearings on other searches and conduct of the 
Bush administration that ignore the rule of law.

</P>
<P>The following can be attributed to Caroline Fredrickson, Director of the ACLU 
Washington Legislative Office:</P>
<P>"While no one is above the law - neither a president nor a member of Congress 
- the executive&#8217;s search of a congressional office, even with a warrant, could 
have the effect of chilling congressional oversight of administration conduct. 
We applaud Chairman Sensenbrenner for examining this issue, and we urge him to 
call hearings on the many examples of the administration&#8217;s abuse of power.</P>
<P>"From warrantless NSA wiretapping, to obtaining phone call information about 
millions of Americans, to the practice of rendering individuals to countries 
known to engage in torture, this administration has consistently abused the 
power of the executive branch and demonstrated a disdain for Congress and the 
rule of law. The Constitution and our laws are not mere advice to the president; 
they are rules by which the government must abide.</P>
<P>"As Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, Congressman Sensenbrenner can 
seek to compel administration officials to testify on these gross violations of 
privacy and fundamental freedoms. The recent search of one congressional office 
by federal law enforcement officials has made some members of Congress keenly 
aware of the White House&#8217;s extraordinary claims of executive power. We hope that 
this outrage and concern, which hits home for lawmakers, extends to the millions 
of Americans whose call information and conversations have been monitored by the 
National Security Agency without a court order. Congress must put an end to the 
administration&#8217;s stonewalling and investigate these gross abuses of 
power."</P></p>
