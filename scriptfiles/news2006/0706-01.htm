<p>WASHINGTON - July 6 -
<p> <b>When</b>: Thursday, July 6, 2006<br>
<b>Where</b>: In Front of the White House, Penn. Avenue between 15th and 17th  

<p>At 10:30am, right before Prime Minister Stephen Harper of Canada meets with President Bush, fasters will demonstrate in front of the White House to request Canada become a refuge for US soldiers who refuse to serve in the Iraq war.  There are several hundred U.S. soldiers who have gone to Canada to avoid the war in Iraq, and so far, but the Canadian government has not granted them refugee status. We are calling on the Canadian prime minister to reclaim the policy of former Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau who said that Canada should be a refuge from mlitarism.

<p>At 12:00pm, fasters will write birthday wishes on empty plates and make a giant greeting card to mark the President’s 60th birthday and call for the troops to come home from Iraq. They will take their birthday offerings to the White House gate.

<p>Organized by CODEPINK: Women for Peace, a group of long-term fasters launched a historic hunger strike against the war in Iraq on July 3, 2006. They will continue to stand outside of the White House until August 15, when they will move to Camp Casey in Crawford, TX.
 
<p>The organizers call on a long history of fasts for political purposes, claiming their place among the Suffragettes, Mahatmas Gandhi and Cesar Chavez.  

<p>Diane Wilson, who has engaged in several hunger strikes in her history as an environmental activist, says she will not set an end date to her fast. “My goal is to bring the troops home. I don’t know how long I can fast, but I’m making this open-ended,” she says.  “I plan to take this as far as I’ve ever taken anything in my 58 years. I fear our future is at stake, and I’m ready to make a major sacrifice.” 
 
<p>Over 3000 celebrities, veterans, mothers, and concerned citizens across the country are also participating in a rolling fast over the summer, fasting as long as they are able and then passing the fast from person to person.  Many will fast in solidarity from their hometowns, urging local leaders to stand for peace. Fasters include musicians Willie Nelson and Michael Franti, actors Danny Glover, Sean Penn and Susan Sarandon, Gulf War vet Michael McPherson, writer Alice Walker, and labor leader Dolores Huerta.  

<p>The rolling fast will last until September 21, International Peace Day, when activists around the country will initiate a week of nonviolent actions against the war as part of the Declaration of Peace.
