<p>GENEVA - March 22 - Greenpeace today welcomed the 
decision of the Brazilian Environment Protection Agency IBAMA to fine 
Swiss Agro-Biotech multinational Syngenta  one million reais (386 000 
euros) for conducting  illegal field trials of GE soy in a buffer zone 
around the Iguacu Falls World Heritage Site. The organisation is 
confident that  a judicial order for the destruction of the genetically 
engineered plants will also be issued in due time. IBAMA' s decision was 
announced today at the UN Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) 
taking place in Curitiba, Brazil.

<p>"This decision sounds a clear warning to agro-biotech firms intent on 
putting economic interests ahead of biosafety and enforces respect for 
biodiversity and protected areas," said Greenpeace International's 
Doreen Stabinsky from the field site. " The announcement is right  on 
the mark and makes a mockery of Syngenta's denial last week that it had 
acted illegally. It confirms the legitimacy and necessity of the 
occupation of the field by local peasants."

<p>National law in Brazil expressly prohibits the planting of GMOs in 
conservation areas as well as buffer zones around those areas, based on 
the precautionary principle.  Syngenta's GE soy field trials were found 
six kilometres from the park, however national law requires a buffer 
zone of at least ten kilometres.

<p>Greenpeace is an independent, campaigning organisation which uses 
non-violent, creative confrontation to expose global environmental 
problems, and to force solutions essential to a green and peaceful future.
