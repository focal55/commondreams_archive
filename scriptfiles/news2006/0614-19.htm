<p>WASHINGTON - June 14 - On this day of infamy, an agrarian revival in the middle of urban 
impoverishment was stamped out by a developer whose price was met by the 
City of Los Angeles but whose obstinacy prevailed all the way to the 
bulldozers he hired to destroy the carefully cultivated little gardens.

<p>The developed has acquired a 14 acre albatross. His destructive behavior 
is only the opening chapter in a struggle to reacquire this nationally 
famous demonstration of community self-reliance - the largest urban farm 
in America. Between the expected citizen mobilization and the pending 
legal actions, the developer will have a busy summer. Any corporation 
showing any interest in building a warehouse there will have to reassess 
the present valuation of its corporate trademarks and good will.
