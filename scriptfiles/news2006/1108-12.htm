<p>WASHINGTON - November 8 - Nancy Keenan, president of NARAL Pro-Choice America, praised the voters of Arizona for electing pro-choice-endorsed candidates Harry Mitchell (5th District) and Gabrielle Giffords (8th District) over anti-choice opponents.</P>
<P>"Arizona's pro-choice pick-ups are a sign that voters are tired of the divisive attacks on women's reproductive freedom," Keenan said. "They want leaders like Mitchell and Giffords who will defend our constitutional rights, while uniting behind commonsense, common-ground proposals, like better access to birth control, that would prevent unintended pregnancies and reduce the need for abortion."</P>
<P>NARAL Pro-Choice America contacted an average of 54,000 households in each of these two highly competitive congressional districts and spent nearly $400,000 on independent expenditures, including voter identification, polling, persuasion mail pieces, online alerts, and phone calls against six-term anti-choice incumbent Rep. J.D. Hayworth (5th District) and anti-choice candidate Randy Graf in the 8th District. This investment is on top of the $20,000 in PAC contributions NARAL Pro-Choice America contributed directly to the pro-choice House candidates' campaigns.</P>
<P>NARAL Pro-Choice America, the nation's largest non-partisan pro-choice political organization, capitalized on the public's call for change with a comprehensive $2.5 million political program, which included independent expenditures in congressional races, direct contributions to candidates, and contributions to the efforts to defeat anti-choice ballot measures. The organization's one-million-strong network of member activists built on these financial investments by phone banking and going door-to-door on behalf of pro-choice candidates across the country. </P>
