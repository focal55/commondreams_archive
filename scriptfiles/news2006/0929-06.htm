<p>WASHINGTON - September 29 - Citizens for  Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) sent a letter  today to the House Committee on Standards of Official Conduct,  better known as the ethics committee, asking for an investigation  into Rep. Mark Foley's (R-Fla.) emails to a 16-year-old former  House page.</p>
<p>   Yesterday, ABC News reported that, using a personal email  account, Rep. Foley sent a number of emails to a former page. The  emails asked the page his age, how school was and what he wanted  for his birthday. Rep. Foley also requested the boy's photograph.</p>
<p>   In 1983, the House censured two members of Congress, Reps. Dan  Crane (R-Ill.) and Gerry Studds (D-Mass.) for having sexual  relationships with pages. In 1990, the ethics committee publicly  disapproved of the conduct of Rep. Gus Savage (D-Ill.), who had  made sexual advances to a Peace Corps volunteer. In all three  cases, the ethics committee relied on the House rule prohibiting  conduct that does not reflect creditably on the House.</p>
<p>   Based on these precedents, CREW asked the ethics committee to  investigate Rep. Foley's E-mails to the former page.</p>
<p>   Melanie Sloan, executive director of CREW said today, &quot;The  House of Representatives has the responsibility to protect  teenagers who come to Congress to learn about the legislative  process. The ethics committee has a moral obligation to  investigate any allegation that a page has been subjected to  sexual advances by a member of Congress and, should the  allegations prove true, take swift action to punish the  offender.&quot; Sloan continued, &quot;The ethics committee should  determine whether Rep. Foley's emails to the former page were  improper.&quot;</p>
<p>   CREW's letter and Rep. Foley's e-mails are available at  <a href="http://releases.usnewswire.com/redir.asp?ReleaseID=73456&Link=http://www.citizensforethics.org">http://www.citizensforethics.org</a>.</p>
