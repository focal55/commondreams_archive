<p>WASHINGTON - March 21 - At this morning's news conference, responding to a question from 
journalist Helen Thomas about the real reason for initiating the Iraq 
war, President Bush said: "I didn't want war. ... No president wants 
war. ... And the world said, 'Disarm, disclose or face serious 
consequences.' And therefore, we worked with the world. We worked to 
make sure that Saddam Hussein heard the message of the world. And when 
he chose to deny the inspectors, when he chose not to disclose, then I 
had the difficult decision to make to remove him." [See:

    Elizabeth de la Vega wrote "The White House Criminal Conspiracy," 
the cover story in a recent issue of The Nation magazine. She has 
recently retired after serving more than 20 years as a federal 
prosecutor in Minneapolis and San Jose. She said today: "Since the 
beginning of the Bush administration's campaign to invade Iraq, veteran 
reporter Helen Thomas has been a modern day Diogenes in search of an 
honest man -- an honest answer -- about the reasons and basis for our 
unprovoked attack on a country 8,000 miles away. President Bush's 
statement today -- that we attacked because Saddam Hussein refused to 
allow inspections -- was untrue when we started the war and it is untrue 
today. The UN inspectors were urging the president to allow the 
inspections to continue, but the president announced that they should 
leave, because we were going to bomb the country in 48 hours. The 
president is engaged in an ongoing fraud and our elected representatives 
are allowing him to get away with it."

the new book "Challenging Empire: How People, Governments, and the UN 
Defy U.S. Power." She said today: "Bush's answer to Helen Thomas frames 
almost all of his central lies about the origins of the Iraq war. He 
claims that Saddam Hussein kept UN inspectors out, when in fact the 
inspectors were on the ground in Iraq and the heads of both UN 
inspection teams indicated that they were getting full compliance. Bush 
says he 'didn't want war,' but he and many in his administration had 
looked for excuses to go to war with Iraq even before they came into 
office and certainly officially beginning Sept. 12 [2001]. Bush says 'I 
had the difficult decision to make,' but that was not Bush's decision to 
make. The UN followed the mandate of its Charter and refused Bush's 
demand for war. Bush's unilateral decision represents a complete 
abandonment of the UN Charter and international law, not to speak of the 
overwhelming opinion of the people of virtually every country in the world."
