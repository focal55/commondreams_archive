<p>NEW YORK - October 9 - The Center for Constitutional Rights (CCR) is proud to announce its acceptance of the third LennonOno Grant for Peace.  Founded by Yoko Ono in honor of the peace activism of John Lennon, the $50,000 award is given to two recipients every two years. Past winners have included investigative journalist Seymour Hersh, and Israeli artist Zvi Goldstein and Palestinian artist Khalil Rabah. CCR will be honored alongside Doctors Without Borders, the first organizations to receive the award.

 

<p>Ms. Ono chose CCR for its 'tireless' work to establish a 'more peaceful' world, particularly its 2004 Supreme Court victory in Rasul v. Bush, which established that detainees held at Guantánamo Bay were still entitled to the right of habeas corpus. That right is a vital check on the power of the President to unilaterally declare anyone anywhere in the world an 'enemy combatant' and, in the case of non-U.S. citizens, detain them indefinitely without access to a court of law. In the wake of the recent suspension of habeas corpus by the U.S. Congress, CCR has been the first organization to file new cases challenging the expansion of the unilateral executive. CCR's Mohammed v. Rumsfeld is the first case filed on behalf of detainees at Bagram Air Force Base in Afghanistan, while Khan v. Bush is the first case filed on behalf of a former ghost detainee held in secret CIA detention.

 

<p>CCR President Michael Ratner, who will accept the award at a special ceremony in Reykjavík  today said: "CCR is proud to accept the LennonOno grant for peace, and we will continue to defend the defenseless and struggle for a more peaceful world."
