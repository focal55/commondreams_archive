<p>WASHINGTON - August 16 - Congressman Dennis J. Kucinich (D-OH) issued the following statement today on news accounts that July was the deadliest month for Iraqi civilians since the start of the war in Iraq:

<p>"Iraq is not spiraling into a civil war. Iraq is already mired in a deadly civil war with US troops, and innocent Iraqis, caught in the crosshairs. The civil war in Iraq cannot and will not be won by the Administration's military occupation of Iraq. 

<p>"Today's news that July was the deadliest month for innocent civilians, since the start of the war, only further proves that over three years since the start of the Administration's ill-advised and misguided war and occupation of Iraq, the situation on the ground is getting worse, not better. 

<p>"According to recently released figures, more than 110 Iraqi civilians were killed a day in July and more than 3,438 were killed during the month of July. This represents a 9 percent increase from June and almost double the toll from January. 

<p>"These gruesome totals demonstrate the complete and total failure of the Administration's Iraq policy. The US is not, and will not, 'win in Iraq' if we continue on this course. 

<p>"The sad irony of this Administration's policy is that, in the name of fighting terrorism, we are actually creating terrorists. 

<p>"Our continued occupation of Iraq is not only counterproductive, but fuels the civil war. We must immediately end the occupation of Iraq and bring our troops home with the honor and dignity they deserve."
