<p>WASHINGTON - September 28 - <p>September 28, 2006</p>
        <p>Mr. President, I oppose the Military Commissions Act. </p>
        <p>Let me be clear: I welcome efforts to bring terrorists to justice. 
          It is about time. This Administration has too long been distracted by 
          the war in Iraq from the fight against al Qaeda. We need a renewed focus 
          on the terrorist networks that present the greatest threat to this country. 
        </p>
        <p>But Mr. President, we wouldn&#8217;t be where we are today, five years 
          after September 11 with not a single Guantanamo Bay detainee having 
          been brought to trial, if the President had come to Congress in the 
          first place, rather than unilaterally creating military commissions 
          that didn&#8217;t comply with the law. The President wanted to act on 
          his own, and he dared the Supreme Court to stop him. And he lost. The 
          Hamdan decision was an historic rebuke to an Administration that has 
          acted for years as if it were above the law. </p>
        <p>Finally, only because he was essentially ordered to do so by the Supreme 
          Court, the President has agreed to consult with Congress. I would have 
          hoped that we would take this opportunity to pass legislation that allows 
          us to proceed in accordance with our laws and our values. That is what 
          separates America from our enemies. These trials, conducted appropriately, 
          have the potential to demonstrate to the world that our democratic, 
          constitutional system of government is our greatest strength in fighting 
          those who attacked us. </p>
        <p>And that is why I am saddened that I must oppose this legislation. 
          Because, Mr. President, the trials conducted under this legislation 
          will send a very different signal to the world, one that I fear will 
          put our own troops and personnel in jeopardy both now and in future 
          conflicts. To take just a few examples, this legislation would permit 
          an individual to be convicted on the basis of coerced testimony and 
          hearsay, would not allow full judicial review of the conviction, and 
          yet would allow someone convicted under these rules to be put to death. 
          That is simply unacceptable. We would not stand for another country 
          to try our citizens under those rules, and we should not stand for our 
          own government to do so, either.</p>
        <p>Not only that, this legislation would deny detainees at Guantanamo 
          Bay and elsewhere&#8212;people who have been held for years but have 
          not been tried or even charged with any crime&#8212;the ability to challenge 
          their detention in court. Among its many flaws, this is the most troubling&#8212;that 
          the legislation seeks to suspend the Great Writ of habeas corpus. </p>
        <p>The legislation before us is better than that originally proposed by 
          the President, which would have largely codified the procedures the 
          Supreme Court has already rejected. And that is thanks to the efforts 
          of some of my Republican colleagues for whom I have great respect and 
          admiration.</p>
        <p>But this bill remains deeply flawed, and I cannot support it. </p>
        <p>One of the most disturbing provisions of this bill eliminates the right 
          of habeas corpus for those detained as enemy combatants. I support an 
          amendment by Senator Specter to strike that provision from the bill. 
          I ask unanimous consent that my separate statement on that amendment 
          be put in the record at the appropriate point.</p>
        <p>Habeas corpus is a fundamental recognition that in America, the government 
          does not have the power to detain people indefinitely and arbitrarily. 
          And that in America, the courts must have the power to review the legality 
          of executive detention decisions. </p>
        <p>Habeas corpus is a longstanding vital part of our American tradition, 
          and is enshrined in the U.S. Constitution. </p>
        <p>As a group of retired judges wrote to Congress, habeas corpus &#8220;safeguards 
          the most hallowed judicial role in our constitutional democracy &#8211; 
          ensuring that no man is imprisoned unlawfully.&#8221; </p>
        <p>Mr. President, this bill would fundamentally alter that historical 
          equation. Faced with an executive branch that has detained hundreds 
          of people without trial for years now, it would eliminate the right 
          of habeas corpus.</p>
        <p>Under this legislation, some individuals, at the designation of the 
          executive branch alone, could be picked up, even in the United States, 
          and held indefinitely without trial and without any access whatsoever 
          to the courts. They would not be able to call upon the laws of our great 
          nation to challenge their detention because they would have been put 
          outside the reach of the law. </p>
        <p>Mr. President, that is unacceptable, and it almost surely violates 
          our Constitution. But that determination will take years of protracted 
          litigation. </p>
        <p>Mr. President, why would we turn our back on hundreds of years of history 
          and our nation&#8217;s commitment to liberty -- particularly when there 
          is no good reason to do so? We should be working to provide a lawful 
          system of military commissions so that those who have committed war 
          crimes can be brought to justice. We can do that quite well without 
          denying one of the most basic rights guaranteed by the Constitution 
          to those held in custody by our government.</p>
        <p>Some have suggested that terrorists who take up arms against this country 
          should not be allowed to challenge their detention in court. But that 
          argument is circular &#8211; the writ of habeas allows those who might 
          be mistakenly detained to challenge their detention in court, before 
          a neutral decision-maker. The alternative is to allow people to be detained 
          indefinitely with no ability to argue that they are not, in fact, enemy 
          combatants. Unless any of my colleagues can say with absolute certainty 
          that everyone detained as an enemy combatant was correctly detained 
          &#8211; and there is ample evidence to suggest that is not the case 
          &#8211; then we should make sure that people can&#8217;t simply be locked 
          up forever, without court review, based on someone slapping a &#8220;terrorist&#8221; 
          label on them.</p>
        <p>There is another reason why we must not deprive detainees of habeas 
          corpus, and that is the fact that the American system of government 
          is supposed to set an example for the world, as a beacon of democracy. 
          And this provision will only serve to harm others&#8217; perception 
          of our system of government.</p>
        <p>Mr. President, a group of retired diplomats sent a very moving letter 
          explaining their concerns about this habeas-stripping provision. Here 
          is what they said: &#8220;To proclaim democratic government to the rest 
          of the world as the supreme form of government at the very moment we 
          eliminate the most important avenue of relief from arbitrary governmental 
          detention will not serve our interests in the larger world.&#8221;</p>
        <p>Many, many dedicated patriotic Americans share these grave reservations 
          about this particular provision of the bill. </p>
        <p>They have reservations not because they sympathize with suspected terrorists. 
          Not because they are soft on national security. Not because they don&#8217;t 
          understand the threat we face. No. They, and we in the Senate who support 
          the Specter amendment, are concerned about this provision because we 
          care about the Constitution, because we care about the image that American 
          presents to the world as we fight the terrorists. Because we know that 
          the writ of habeas corpus provides one of the most significant protections 
          of human freedom against arbitrary government action ever created. If 
          we sacrifice it here, we will head down a road that history will judge 
          harshly and our descendants will regret.</p>
        <p>Mr. President, we must not imperil our proud history. We must not abandon 
          the Great Writ. We must not jeopardize our nation&#8217;s proud traditions 
          and principles by suspending the writ of habeas corpus, and permitting 
          our government to pick people up off the street, even in U.S. cities, 
          and detain them indefinitely without court review. That is not what 
          America is about. </p>
        <p>Unfortunately, the suspension of the Great Writ is not the only problem 
          with this legislation, nor is it the only instance where the legislation 
          goes beyond establishing military commissions to include unnecessary 
          provisions with deeply troubling results. </p>
        <p>The Administration has spoken about the need for this legislation to 
          bring clarity to the War Crimes Act, which makes it a crime to violate 
          Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions. It has proposed that we 
          specifically list the actions that would be considered crimes under 
          that law. On the face of it, that certainly sounds sensible. But when 
          you look at this legislation, you realize that the modification it makes 
          only muddies the waters. Not only that, it does so retroactively.</p>
        <p>The key problem is in the definition of &#8220;cruel or inhuman&#8221; 
          treatment. This is a critical definition because it is the provision 
          that determines which coercive interrogation techniques amount to crimes 
          under U.S. law. But because of the complex structure of this section, 
          it is very difficult to understand what the new definition would criminalize, 
          and I am concerned that any ambiguity may be interpreted too narrowly 
          by some. The definition incorporates several terms that in turn have 
          their own separate definitions, and it even has one new definition that 
          doesn&#8217;t go into effect until the date of enactment, even though 
          the rest of the amendments to the War Crimes Act are made retroactive 
          to 1997. Frankly, Mr. President, the new prohibition is extremely unclear. 
          And we have already heard different interpretations of it from Senators 
          and Administration officials who negotiated the language. If our goal 
          is to give unambiguous guidance to our personnel, and the courts, this 
          does not do it. </p>
        <p>The way the provision is drafted, it even seems designed to grant immunity 
          to senior officials who authorized coercive interrogation techniques.</p>
        <p>Mr. President, we should just follow the approach originally endorsed 
          by the Senate Armed Services Committee, which would have applied the 
          language of the McCain amendment. </p>
        <p>Mr. President, I am also very concerned about the definition of unlawful 
          enemy combatant that is included in this legislation, and about the 
          corresponding issue of the jurisdiction of the military commissions.</p>
        <p>Mr. President, this legislation has been justified as necessary to 
          allow our government to prosecute Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and other dangerous 
          men recently transferred to Guantanamo Bay. Yet if you look at the fine 
          print of this legislation, it becomes clear that it is much, much broader 
          than that. It would permit trial by military commission not just for 
          those accused of serious terrorist crimes, but also individuals, including 
          legal permanent residents of this country, who are alleged to have &#8220;purposefully 
          and materially supported hostilities&#8221; against the United States 
          or its allies. </p>
        <p>This is extremely broad, and key terms go undefined. And by including 
          hostilities not only against the United States but also against its 
          allies, the bill allows the U.S. to hold and try by military commission 
          individuals who have never engaged, directly or indirectly, in any action 
          against the United States. </p>
        <p>Not only that, but the bill would also define as an unlawful enemy 
          combatant subject to trial by military commission, anyone who &#8220;has 
          been determined to be an unlawful enemy combatant by a Combatant Status 
          Review Tribunal or another competent tribunal established under the 
          authority of the President or the Secretary of Defense.&#8221; This 
          essentially grants a blank check to the executive branch to decide entirely 
          on its own who can be tried by military commission. </p>
        <p>If we are going to establish military commissions outside of our traditional 
          military and civilian justice systems, at a minimum we should explicitly 
          limit their application to the worst of the worst, those who pose a 
          serious threat to our country. We shouldn&#8217;t leave it up to just 
          one branch of government to make these incredibly important decisions.</p>
        <p>Mr. President, the bulk of this legislation concerns the structure 
          and process of military commissions. Although we heard from many witnesses 
          at congressional hearings this summer that we should hew as closely 
          as possible to the long-established military system of justice, this 
          bill instead essentially starts from scratch and creates a whole new 
          structure. It does so despite Justice Kennedy&#8217;s wise advice in 
          his concurrence in Hamdan, where he said: &#8220;The Constitution is 
          best preserved by reliance on standards tested over time and insulated 
          from the pressures of the moment.&#8221; </p>
        <p>For example, this legislation creates a presumption for the admissibility 
          of hearsay evidence. Now, it is true that because of the exigencies 
          of war and active combat situations, hearsay rules may need to be structured 
          differently than they are in our criminal courts, but the rules laid 
          out in the UCMJ are drafted to handle these same exigencies. While there 
          may need to be some adjustments to the UCMJ hearsay rules, we need not 
          discard them altogether. </p>
        <p>The presumption against hearsay is a fundamental protection built into 
          our existing legal structures to ensure that proceedings yield a just 
          and fair result. Yet in this provision and elsewhere, the legislation 
          erodes such protections&#8212;going far beyond what is allowed in the 
          military system&#8212;and without justification. </p>
        <p>Even more disturbing is that the bill appears to permit individuals 
          to be convicted, and even sentenced to death, on the basis of coerced 
          testimony. According to the legislation, statements obtained through 
          cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment, as long as it was obtained prior 
          to December 2005 when the McCain amendment become law, would apparently 
          be admissible in many instances in these military commissions. </p>
        <p>Now, it is true that the bill would require the commission to find 
          these statements have sufficient reliability and probative value. But 
          why would we go down this road of trying to convict people based on 
          statements obtained through cruel, inhuman, or degrading interrogation 
          techniques? Either we are a nation that stands against this type of 
          cruelty and for the rule of law, or we are not. We can&#8217;t have 
          it both ways.</p>
        <p>The idea that coerced statements can be used as long as they were obtained 
          long enough ago is appalling. It seems to assume that there was a lack 
          of clarity in the law prior to December 2005. In fact, there was great 
          clarity, until this Administration decided to invent a narrow definition 
          of torture that had never been used or accepted anywhere in the civilized 
          world. The McCain amendment was needed to get this Administration to 
          return to the law. It was a repudiation of the legal theories of the 
          infamous Bybee memo, which the Administration even said it was withdrawing 
          once it was publicly revealed. Its enactment should not now be used 
          as a dividing point before which evidence obtained through cruel and 
          inhuman treatment can be used in court. </p>
        <p>At times of great adversity, the strength of a nation&#8217;s convictions 
          is tested and its true character revealed. If we sacrifice or qualify 
          our principles in the face of the tremendous challenge we face from 
          terrorists who want to destroy America, we will be making a terrible 
          mistake. If we cloak cruel or degrading interrogations done in the name 
          of American safety with euphemisms like &#8220;alternative techniques,&#8221; 
          if we create arbitrary dates for when differing degrees of morality 
          will apply, we will have betrayed our principles and ourselves. </p>
        <p>Statements obtained through such techniques should not be admissible, 
          even against the most vicious killers in the world, in proceedings held 
          by the government of the United States of America. Period. </p>
        <p>Mr. President, in sum, this legislation is very troubling and in many 
          respects legally suspect. I fear the end result of this legislation 
          will only be more delay. It will surely be subject to further legal 
          challenge, and may squander another four or five years while cases work 
          their way through the courts again. </p>
        <p>We can and must fight terrorism aggressively without compromising fundamental 
          American values. We must remember what the Army Judge Advocate General 
          told me at a Judiciary Committee hearing this summer: that the United 
          States should set an example for the world, and that we must carefully 
          consider the effect on the way our own soldiers will be treated. </p>
        <p>Mr. President, in closing let me do something I don&#8217;t do very 
          often &#8211; and that is quote John Ashcroft. According to the New 
          York Times, at a private meeting of high-level officials in 2003 about 
          the military commission structure, then-Attorney General Ashcroft said: 
          &#8220;Timothy McVeigh was one of the worst killers in U.S. history. 
          But at least we had fair procedures for him.&#8221; How sad that this 
          Congress would seek to pass legislation about which the same cannot 
          be said. </p>
