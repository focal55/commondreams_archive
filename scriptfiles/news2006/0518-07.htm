<p>WASHINGTON - May 18 - <p align="center"><b>&#8216;This shameful election-year ploy puts the 
Senate one step closer to a vote that threatens to write discrimination 
into the U.S. Constitution,&#8217; said Human Rights Campaign President 
Joe Solmonese.</b></p>

<p>Human Rights Campaign President Joe 
Solmonese made the following statement as the Federal Marriage Amendment 
(S.J. Res. 1) was marked up today by the Senate Judiciary Committee.</p>

<p>&#8220;This shameful election-year ploy puts the Senate one step 
closer to a vote that threatens to write discrimination into the U.S. 
Constitution,&#8221; said Solmonese. &#8220;Today&#8217;s vote served 
only to divide Americans, not help us with our collective challenges. As 
this amendment nears a vote on the Senate floor, it&#8217;s critical 
that fair-minded Americans speak up and speak out against discrimination 
in the Constitution.&#8221;</p>

<p>With less than 24 hours&#8217; notice, the Senate Judiciary Committee 
moved the markup from a public hearing room to a restricted-access room 
in the Capitol. The President&#8217;s Room is not open to the public and 
does not even have enough chairs for every senator on the committee to 
sit.&#160;</p>

<p>Solmonese continued, &#8220;Using the constitutional amendment 
process as a political tool is bad enough, but doing it behind closed 
doors is appalling.&#160;The U.S. Senate shouldn&#8217;t be playing fast 
and loose with our most fundamental freedoms.&#8221;</p>

<p>In 2004, the Senate and House both fell far short of the two-thirds 
vote necessary to send the amendment to the states for ratification. In 
the Senate, the vote against cloture was 50 to 48, with six Republicans 
voting no. The Republicans who opposed cloture were Sens. Ben Campbell, 
R-Colo.; Lincoln Chafee, R-R.I.; Susan Collins, R-Maine; John McCain, 
R-Ariz.; Olympia Snowe, R-Maine; and John Sununu, R-N.H.&#160;In the 
House, the vote was 227 to 186.&#160;</p>

<p>Many prominent Republicans and conservatives expressed opposition to 
the amendment in 2004, including Vice President Dick Cheney, Arlen 
Specter, Rudy Guiliani, Chuck Hagel, David Dreier, George Pataki, Bob 
Barr, Alan Simpson, George Will and David Brooks. This year, those 
numbers increased to former Sen. John Danforth who called the amendment 
&#8220;silly&#8221; and &#8220;contrary to basic Republican 
principles.&#8221; First Lady Laura Bush was recently quoted as saying, 
&#8220;I don&#8217;t think it should be used as a campaign tool, 
obviously.&#8221; McCain has repeatedly reaffirmed his opposition to the 
amendment. And today Will again restated his opposition by lauding 
Sununu&#8217;s vote against the amendment as a vote against the 
&#8220;federal usurpation of the traditional state responsibility for 
marriage law,&#8221; saying that it &#8220;affirmed the value of 
cultural federalism.&#8221;</p>

<p><i>The Human Rights Campaign is the largest national lesbian, gay, 
bisexual and transgender political organization with members throughout 
the country. It effectively lobbies Congress, provides campaign support
