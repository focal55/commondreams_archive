<p>WASHINGTON - November 8 - Just one day after millions of women and men cast their votes to 
            determine the direction of this country, nine Supreme Court justices 
            will consider the constitutionality of the United States' first 
            abortion procedures ban -- a ban enacted by the Bush administration 
and its friends in Congress. 
<P>On Wednesday, Nov. 8, the Supreme Court will hear oral arguments 
            in <EM>Gonzales v. Carhart</EM> and <EM>Gonzales v. Planned 
            Parenthood</EM>. Both cases address the deceptively-named "partial 
            birth abortion" ban that George W. Bush signed into law on Nov. 5, 
            2003, while surrounded by a group of grinning legislators -- not one 
            of them a woman. </P>
            <P>A Nebraska law identical in effect to the federal ban was struck 
            down by the Supreme Court in 2000 because it didn't protect women's 
            health. Soon we will learn whether the court's two newest members -- 
            Chief Justice John Roberts and Associate Justice Samuel Alito -- are 
            as devoted to precedent as they say they are, or whether their 
            visceral opposition to abortion will lead them to overturn a clear 
            precedent after only six years. </P>
            <P>One of the cases, <EM>Gonzales v. Carhart</EM>, concerns the same 
            doctor, the same state, and the same issues as did <EM>Stenberg v. 
            Carhart</EM> in 2000, when Dr. Leroy Carhart challenged a Nebraska 
            law that banned certain vaguely-defined abortion procedures without 
            including any exception for a woman whose health is at risk. </P>
            <P>The Court's narrow 5-4 opinion in that 2000 case found the law 
            unconstitutional. The outcome in the cases being argued this week 
            could be different without retired Justice Sandra Day O'Connor on 
            the bench. O'Connor cast the deciding vote in the Nebraska case and 
            was replaced earlier this year by abortion opponent Alito.</P>
            <P>The precedent set by <EM>Stenberg</EM> in 2000 was the reason 
            three federal appeals courts declared the federal ban 
            unconstitutional as well. But the Bush administration has pressed on 
            with appeals to the Supreme Court by Attorney General Alberto 
            Gonzales.</P>
            <P>Not only will we find out whether our new justices are committed 
            to "stare decisis" and settled law -- as Roberts and Alito assured 
            senators they were -- but we will also see whether their opposition 
            to abortion means they will force physicians to violate their 
            Hippocratic oath, putting the desire of conservatives in Congress to 
            control women's bodies above a doctor's medical duty to put their 
            patients' health first. </P>
            <P>This isn't the first time Congress has tried to practice medicine 
            without a license, but if this ban is upheld, it will be the first 
            time the Supreme Court has allowed them to do so. The court's line 
            of questioning on Nov. 8, and its eventual ruling on the federal 
            abortion procedures ban, could signal the fate of women's 
            reproductive rights in the United 
States.</P><!-- #EndEditable -->
