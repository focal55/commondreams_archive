<p>WASHINGTON - March 1 - At the conclusion of the 
U.S.' month-long presidency of the United Nations (UN) Security Council, 
Africa Action today condemned the failure of the U.S. to use that 
opportunity to gain support for new international action to address the 
ongoing genocide in Darfur, Sudan. Despite the authorization of 
contingency planning for a possible future UN peacekeeping operation in 
Darfur, and despite rhetorical commitments by the Bush Administration to 
promoting urgent action on Darfur, February passed without any concrete 
response to the immediate need for protection for civilians and 
humanitarian operations in Darfur.

<p>Salih Booker, Executive Director of Africa Action, said today, "Eighteen 
months have passed since the Bush Administration acknowledged that 
genocide was taking place in Darfur, and the U.S. has yet to demonstrate 
the political will to stop this genocide. Apparently the Bush 
Administration considers it tolerable for genocide to continue in 
Darfur, as it was in Rwanda. The people of Darfur have been abandoned to 
a double standard that makes genocide acceptable in Africa."

<p>As the situation in Darfur continues to deteriorate, and a growing 
crisis on the border with Chad threatens regional stability, Africa 
Action emphasized the urgent need for a UN peacekeeping force with a 
Chapter 7 mandate to be deployed to Darfur immediately to address the 
security needs on the ground.

<p>Ann-Louise Colgan, Director of Policy Analysis & Communications at 
Africa Action, said today, "The U.S. must work at every level to promote 
a Security Council resolution authorizing a robust UN mission in Darfur 
without delay. New reports of strong opposition to a UN force from the 
government of Sudan are a cause for grave concern, and the U.S. must 
redouble its diplomatic efforts, and work with the African Union, to 
ensure broad and committed international support for a UN mission for 
Darfur."

<p>Marie Clarke Brill, Director of Public Education & Mobilization at 
Africa Action, said today, "Public pressure moved the Administration to 
focus on Darfur in February, and statements from the President and 
senior U.S. officials signaled a new commitment to addressing this 
crisis. But we are still waiting for action that will change the reality 
on the ground in Darfur. Activists across the country who were engaged 
during February will continue to escalate pressure in the coming weeks 
to ensure the passage of a Security Council resolution authorizing a UN 
peacekeeping mission for Darfur."
