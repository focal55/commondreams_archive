<p>WASHINGTON - March 14 - Last week, the 
Food and Drug Administration heard testimony from the American Red 
Cross, the American Association of Blood Banks and America&#8217;s Blood 
Centers that the ban on blood donations from men who have had sex with 
men since 1977 should be lifted. Human Rights Campaign President Joe 
Solmonese released the following statement:

<p>Twentieth century prejudice shouldn&#8217;t keep us from 21st century health standards. 
Our nation&#8217;s leading blood services organizations agree that there 
is no rational justification for treating gay and bisexual men different 
than straight men. Given modern testing and the fact that anyone can be 
vulnerable to infection, there is no medical or scientific rationale for 
this discriminatory policy.

<p>Natural disasters like 
Hurricane Katrina and the threat of catastrophic terrorist attack make 
our nation&#8217;s need for a robust and safe blood supply even more 
acute. The real public health threat is closing the door on countless 
numbers of men who selflessly want to donate blood. The Food and Drug 
Administration should heed the advice of the Red Cross and other groups 
and put science and our nation&#8217;s security over misguided 
prejudice. Additionally, the American Red Cross, the American 
Association of Blood Banks and America&#8217;s Blood Centers should be 
applauded for this fair-minded and scientific approach to ensuring a 
stable and safe blood supply for those in need.&#8221;

<p>The Human Rights Campaign is 
the largest national lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender political 
organization with members throughout the country.&#160;It effectively 
lobbies Congress, provides campaign support and educates the public to 
ensure that LGBT Americans can be open, honest and safe at home, at work 
and in the community.<!-- #EndEditable -->
