<p>WASHINGTON - November 1 - An internal <a href="images/ABCmemo.pdf" title="">memo</a> from <span class="media_outlet">ABC Radio Networks</span> to its affiliates reveals scores of powerful sponsors have a standing order that their commercials never be placed on syndicated <span class="media_outlet">Air America</span> programming that airs on <span class="media_outlet">ABC</span> affiliates. <br />

<br />
The October 25 memo was provided to FAIR by the <span class="media_outlet">Peter B. Collins Show</span>, a syndicated radio show originating on the West Coast. <br />
<br />
Headlined "<span class="media_outlet">Air America</span> Blackout" and addressed "Dear Traffic Director"&#8212;referring to the radio station staffer who coordinates  programming and advertising&#8212;the memo gives the following order to affiliates:<br />
<br />
<div class="sideindent">Please be advised that Hewlett Packard has purchased schedules with <span class="media_outlet">ABC Radio Networks</span> between October 30th and December 24th, 2006. Please make sure you blackout this advertiser on your station, as they do not wish it to air on any <span class="media_outlet">Air America</span> affiliate.</div><br />

<br />
The directive then advises <span class="media_outlet">ABC Radio Network</span> affiliates to take note of a list of other sponsors who do not want their programming to run during <span class="media_outlet">Air America</span> programming. <br />
<br />
<div class="sideindent">Please see below for a complete list of all advertisers requesting that NONE of their commercials air within Air America programming.</div> <br />
<br />
The <a href="images/ABCmemo.pdf" title="">list</a>, totaling 90 advertisers, includes some of largest and most well-known corporations advertising in the U.S.: Wal-Mart, GE, Exxon Mobil, Microsoft, Bank of America, Fed-Ex, Visa, Allstate, McDonald's, Sony and Johnson &amp; Johnson. The U.S. Postal Service and the U.S. Navy are also listed as advertisers who don't want their commercials to air on <span class="media_outlet">Air America</span>.<br />

<br />
The <span class="media_outlet">ABC</span> memo is evidence of the potentially censorious effect that advertisers' political preferences can have on the range of views presented in the media. When Al Gore proposed launching a progressive TV network, a <span class="media_outlet">Fox News</span> executive told <span class="media_outlet">Advertising Age</span> (10/13/03): "The problem with being associated as liberal is that they wouldn't be going in a direction that advertisers are really interested in.... If you go out and say that you are a liberal network, you are cutting your potential audience, and certainly your potential advertising pool, right off the bat." (See <span class="media_outlet">Extra!</span>, <a href="index.php?page=2595" title="">11-12/03</a>.)<br />
<br />

FAIR's call to the <span class="media_outlet">ABC</span> contact person listed on the memo, to ask if similar "blackout" lists exist for other shows, including conservative-leaning programs, has not been returned. <!-- #EndEditable -->
