<p>WASHINGTON  - September 8 - The American Civil Liberties Union today joined with Citizen 
Against Government Waste and the Cato Institute to oppose the Western Hemisphere 
Travel Initiative (WHTI). The WHTI will require all travelers, including 
American citizens, to have a passport or other "appropriate security document" 
to enter or re-enter the United States from countries within the Western 
Hemisphere, including Canada and Mexico.</P>
<P>"We do not dispute the government&#8217;s need to secure the borders, but policies 
must make sense, provide security and be effective: the WHTI fails on all three 
points," said Timothy D. Sparapani, an ACLU Legislative Counsel. "The WHTI will 
not improve our national security, but it will undermine the privacy of law 
abiding Americans and create an ideal target for identity thieves. We urge 
Congress and the administration to revisit this faulty plan."</P>
<P>The WHTI was mandated by the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act 
of 2004, and is slated to roll out in 2008. CAGW today issued a report outlining 
the shortcomings of the WHTI program.</P>
<P>The ACLU noted that no privacy protections exist regulating the sharing of 
information collected under WHTI or what information the new "appropriate 
security documents" would store. The WHTI would vastly expand the use of 
unproven biometrics such as facial recognition and create a tracking database 
that could be linked to private information. The WHTI doesn&#8217;t explicitly 
prohibit how the information can -- and can&#8217;t -- be used, leaving Americans 
vulnerable to invasions of their privacy.</P>
<P>Recent security breaches have shown that storing vast information in a single 
database is especially precarious and a ripe target for identity thieves. Any 
new identification document will likely contain radio frequency identification 
(RFID) technology, similar to that contained in new passports. Studies have 
shown that identity thieves, with the appropriate resources, can easily "skim" 
and clone the information contained in those documents.</P>
<P>In addition to the privacy concerns, estimates predict a loss of hundreds of 
millions of dollars from the American economy due to decreased cross-border and 
border-state commerce as a result of the WHTI. According to the Conference Board 
of Canada, our economy could lose up to $1.5 billion in money spent by Canadian 
tourists and lose up to 3.5 million Canadian tourists during the first year of 
WHTI alone.</P>
<P>"At its core, the WHTI only gives the illusion of security," Sparapani added. 
"Terrorists, smugglers and undocumented immigrants could still find ways to 
enter the country or obtain false documents. The privacy of Americans should not 
be compromised under a failed program."</P><!-- #EndEditable -->
