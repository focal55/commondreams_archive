<p>WASHINGTON - February 15 - Congressman Dennis J. Kucinich (D-OH), today, introduced a Resolution of Inquiry demanding all documents pertaining to contracts that the United States government has signed with the intent to 'sell' the war in Iraq.  

<p>Kucinich's resolution directs the President, Secretary of State and Secretary of Defense, "provide the House of Representatives certain documents in their possession relating to any entity with which the United States has contracted for public relations purposes concerning Iraq."

<p>Kucinich's resolution follows reports that companies such as the Rendon Group and the Lincoln Group were hired by the Administration to 'sell' the war in Iraq to the American public.

<p>"The taxpayers of this country have a right to know whether or not their tax dollars were, or are, being used to manipulate the news, falsify intelligence or mislead the public," stated Kucinich. "Very serious questions have been raised about these contracts, Congress has a Constitutional responsibility to provide oversight."

<p>A Resolution of Inquiry is a rare House procedure used to obtain documents from the Executive Branch. Under House rules, Kucinich's resolution is referred to committee, and action must be taken in committee within 14 legislative days.

<p>"This Congress has been negligent in its oversight of this Administration and their misguided war policy," continued Kucinich. "The American public, and the Congress, have a right to know to what lengths this Administration went to, and continued to use, to sell the war to the public."
