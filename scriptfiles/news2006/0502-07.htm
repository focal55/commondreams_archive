<p>WASHINGTON - May 2 - More than 10 murder-suicides, almost all by gun, occur each week in 
        the United States, according to <a href="http://www.vpc.org/studies/amroul2006.pdf">American Roulette: Murder-Suicide in the 
        United States</a>, (<a href="http://www.vpc.org/studies/amroul2006.pdf">http://www.vpc.org/studies/amroul2006.pdf</a>) a new study 
        by the Violence Policy Center (VPC). The study used a national news clipping 
        service and Internet survey tools to collect incidents nationwide from 
        January 1, 2005, through June 30, 2005, and is one of the largest and 
        most comprehensive studies ever conducted on murder-suicide. During this 
        six-month period, at least 591 Americans died in 264 murder-suicides, 
        and almost all murder-suicides (92 percent) involved a firearm. Using 
        these figures, the VPC estimates that nearly 1,200 Americans die each 
        year in murder-suicides. Additional study findings include-- </p>
      <ul>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Six states had 
          more than 10 murder-suicides in the six-month study period: Pennsylvania 
          (18); Texas (18); California (17); Florida (15); North Carolina (14); 
          and, Tennessee (11).<br>
          <br>
          </font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Ninety-four percent 
          of the offenders in murder-suicides were male. <br>
          <br>
          </font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Seventy-four percent 
          of all murder-suicides involved an intimate partner (spouse, common-law 
          spouse, ex-spouse, or boyfriend/girlfriend). Of these, 96 percent were 
          females killed by their intimate partners. <br>
          <br>
          </font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Most murder-suicides 
          with three or more victims involved a “family annihilator”—a subcategory 
          of intimate partner murder-suicide. Family annihilators are murderers 
          who kill not only their wives/girlfriends and children, but often other 
          family members as well, before killing themselves. <br>
          <br>
          </font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Forty-seven children 
          and teens under the age of 18 were murdered in murder-suicides. <br>
          <br>
          </font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Most murderers 
          in murder-suicides are older than their victims. <br>
          <br>
          </font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Seventy-five percent 
          of murder-suicides occurred in the home. </font></li>
      </ul>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">VPC Legislative Director 
        Kristen Rand states, “Murder-suicide wreaks havoc on hundreds of American 
        families each year. Much more needs to be done to understand and prevent 
        murder-suicide. One key aspect of prevention is reducing access to firearms, 
        by far the weapon of choice in murder-suicide.” </font></p>
