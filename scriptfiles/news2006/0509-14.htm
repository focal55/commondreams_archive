<p>WASHINGTON - May 9 - A US District Court in the District of Columbia ruled yesterday that former Guantanamo detainees can proceed with their claims against Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld and high ranking military officers for intentional violations of their rights to practice their religion.  The litigation was brought on behalf of four British citizens, who were released without charge from Guantanamo in 2004, by the Washington law firm of Baach Robinson & Lewis working with the New York-based Center for Constitutional Rights.  The former detainees sued Secretary Rumsfeld and the others in October 2004 under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act ("RFRA"), which prohibits US government officials from interfering with any person's free exercise of his religious beliefs.  The suit seeks $10 million in damages and charges that the Pentagon chain of command authorized and condoned torture and other mistreatment.

 

<p>Yesterday, Judge Ricardo M. Urbina rejected the government officials' arguments that the detainees' claims under RFRA should be dismissed.  He ruled that the detainees' claims that they were mistreated in the practice of their religion and that government officers took deliberate steps to violate their religious faith and prevent them from practicing their religion during their incarceration at the Guantanamo Naval Base could proceed under the RFRA, a 1993 law that substantially restricts the ability of government officers to take actions that interfere with individual religious liberty. 

<p>Judge Urbina's 22-page decision states that the detainees' complaint alleges that US government officials committed a "direct affront to one of this nation's most cherished constitutional traditions."   According to the decision, the language of RFRA itself, not to mention the "basic principles of morality and human dignity," should have put Secretary Rumsfeld and the rest of the government officials on notice that their conduct was illegal.   


<p>"Mr. Rasul and the other plaintiffs in this case were denied basic rights to worship as part of a systematic attempt to denigrate them as human beings.   Thankfully, United States law strictly prohibits government officers from engaging in this sort of behavior.  Judge Urbina's decision sends a strong message that Secretary Rumsfeld and the Generals who implemented these policies will be held accountable,"  said Eric Lewis, lead lawyer for the detainees.

 

<p>"Judge Urbina has upheld the cherished American tradition that courts are duty bound to review outrageous and illegal actions even if those actions are undertaken by U.S. officials, even if they are claimed to be a part of the "war on terror" and even if they are committed offshore in such places as Guantánamo.  We are grateful that traditional American values have been upheld by an American court."

 

 

<p>Judge Urbina had earlier dismissed claims brought under the Geneva Conventions and the US Constitution.
