<p>WASHINGTON - July 14 - <br>


<b><a href="mailto:mike@thenation.com">STEPHEN F. COHEN</a></b><br>

<b><a href="mailto:kat@thenation.com">KATRINA VANDEN HEUVEL</a></b><br>

    Available for a very limited number of interviews, Cohen is 
professor of Russian studies at New York University and author of the 
book "Failed Crusade: America and the Tragedy of Post-Communist Russia."
<p>Katrina vanden Heuvel is editor of The Nation and, with Cohen, 
author of the book "Voices of Glasnost: Conversations With 
Gorbachev's Reformers."
<p>Cohen wrote a recent cover story for The Nation titled "The New 
American Cold War," which began: "Contrary to established opinion, 
the gravest threats to America's national security are still in 
Russia. They derive from an unprecedented development that most U.S. 
policy-makers have recklessly disregarded, as evidenced by the 
undeclared cold war Washington has waged, under both parties, against 
post-Communist Russia during the past fifteen years." The article and 
an interview of Cohen by Charlie Rose are at:

<p><b><a href="mailto:jbecker@bard.edu">JONATHAN BECKER</a></b>, <a href="http://www.bard.edu/globalstudy" target="_new">http://www.bard.edu/globalstudy</a><br>
Becker is dean of International Studies at Bard College and 
author of the book "Soviet and Russian Press Coverage of the United States." 
<p>He wrote in his new piece "<a href="http://www.theglobalist.com/StoryId.aspx?StoryId=5496" target="_new">Bush and Putin as Leaders: The Ties 
That Bind</a>": 
"America and Russia are undergoing a convergence of sorts. However, 
rather than Russia adopting liberal democracy, the United States may 
be moving closer to a Russian notion of managed democracy. ... Both 
presidents are identified with the fight against terror -- and their 
leadership credentials are inextricably intertwined with that fight."
