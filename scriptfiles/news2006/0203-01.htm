<p>WASHINGTON - February 3 - Congressman Dennis J. Kucinich (D-OH) issued the following statement today on the Administration's request for an additional $70 billion mostly for the war in Iraq:

<p>"Congress should reject the Administration's latest request. It is time to stop finding our ill advised, ill planed and counterproductive war and occupation of Iraq. 

<p>"The Administration entire war policy has been a failure. It is far past time for Congress to say enough is enough. At the expense of vital domestic needs such as health care, education and Gulf Coast recovery, American taxpayers have already paid over $250 billion for the President's war of choice.

<p>"Iraq has held three elections and is now a sovereign nation. Meanwhile, our troops are caught in the middle of a civil war that our own generals say cannot be won by military force. To funnel more money into this failed misadventure would serve only to throw good money after bad. 

<p>"Congress should not serve as a rubber stamp of this Administration's failed policies.  Congress should reject this Supplemental request, along with the Administration's failed policy in Iraq, and work to bring all our troops home."
