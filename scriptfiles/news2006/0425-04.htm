<p>WASHINGTON - APRIL 25 - The multimillion- dollar lobbying effort to repeal the federal estate tax has been  aggressively led by 18 super-wealthy families, according to a  report released today by Public Citizen and United for a Fair  Economy at a press conference in Washington, D.C. The report  details for the first time the vast money, influence and  deceptive marketing techniques behind the rhetoric in the  campaign to repeal the tax.</p>
<p>   It reveals how 18 families worth a total of $185.5 billion  have financed and coordinated a 10-year effort to repeal the  estate tax, a move that would collectively net them a windfall of  $71.6 billion.</p>
<p>   The report, available at <a href="http://releases.usnewswire.com/redir.asp?ReleaseID=64520&Link=http://www.citizen.org">http://www.citizen.org</a> , profiles the  families and their businesses, which include the families behind  Wal-Mart, Gallo wine, Campbell's soup, and Mars Inc., maker of  M&amp;Ms. Collectively, the list includes the first- and third- largest privately held companies in the United States, the  richest family in Alabama and the world's largest retailer.</p>
<p>   These families have sought to keep their activities anonymous  by using associations to represent them and by forming a massive  coalition of business and trade associations dedicated to pushing  for estate tax repeal. The report details the groups they have  hidden behind -- the trade associations they have used, the  lobbyists they have hired, and the anti-estate tax political  action committees, 527s and organizations to which they have donated heavily.</p>
<p>   In a massive public relations campaign, the families have also  misled the country by giving the mistaken impression that the  estate tax affects most Americans. In particular, they have used  small businesses and family farms as poster children for repeal,  saying that the estate tax destroys both of these groups. But  just more than one-fourth of one percent of all estates will owe any estate taxes in 2006. And the American Farm Bureau,  a member of the anti-estate tax coalition, was unable when asked  by The New York Times to cite a single example of a family being  forced to sell its farm because of estate tax liability.</p>
<p>   &quot;This report exposes one of the biggest con jobs in recent  history,&quot; said Joan Claybrook, president of Public Citizen. &quot;This  long-running, secretive campaign funded by some of the country's  wealthiest families has relied on deception to bamboozle the  public not only about who must pay the estate tax, but about how repealing it will affect the country.&quot;</p>
<p>   Said Lee Ferris, senior organizer for estate tax policy at  UFE, &quot;It's time for the majority of Americans who support the  estate tax to speak out, and not let a handful of wealthy  families sway Congress to twist the tax laws for their own  benefit. Polls now show that most Americans support this tax and the revenue it yields to pay for vital services, especially  given our nation's huge deficit.&quot;</p>
<p>   While they extol the hard work of individual farmers and small  businesses, most of the 18 families have been wealthy for  generations; only five still include the people who first earned  the family fortune. Members of the families are far less likely  than most Americans to have paid taxes on their wealth; to a  large extent, that wealth lies in assets that have appreciated  but, unlike paychecks, have never been taxed.</p>
<p>   These super-rich families have spent millions in personal  wealth and used their companies' resources and lobbying power in  repeated attempts to influence members of Congress to repeal the  tax. They have financed groups who have launched multimillion- dollar attack ads against Republican and Democratic senators  alike, including former Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.) and Sens. Max Baucus (D-Mont.), Olympia Snow (R- Maine), Blanche Lincoln (D-Ark.), Mark Pryor (D-Ark.), Lincoln  Chaffee (R-R.I.) and Kent Conrad (D-N.D.).</p>
<p>   The stakes of the campaign are great, not only for the super- wealthy families, but for the public. If the families' repeal bid  succeeds, it will cost the U.S. Treasury a trillion dollars in  the first decade -- roughly what it would cost to provide health  insurance for every uninsured person in the United States.</p>
<p>   &quot;The estate tax should be regarded as just paying back to the  country for all the wonderful things it's made possible for the  people who have that wealth,&quot; said Bill Gates Sr. in an audio  statement played at the press conference. &quot;I don't think there's  any great societal goal being served by inherited wealth. And  certainly there's no sensible argument that I can think of for insisting on being able to pass the last penny of  $100 million on to your three kids.&quot;</p>
<p>   Added Elizabeth Letzler, an investment manager from New York  who will be subject to the estate tax and who spoke at the press  conference, &quot;The current estate tax structure should permit any  wealthy household to pass on a legacy of financial security,  education and family heirlooms to the next generations.&quot; She  challenged the families showcased in the report: &quot;Do something spectacular during your life-time investing in the  social welfare and well-being of the children and grandchildren  at the bottom of the pyramid.&quot; Her daughter Stephanie, also in  attendance, said, &quot;If keeping the estate tax means a step closer  to a debt-free treasury, a step closer to improved health care,  Social Security, education, and every other program that makes me proud to be an American, show me where to sign the  check.&quot;</p>
<p>   Paul Newman, actor and founder of Newman's Own food company,  agreed in a separate statement: &quot;For those of us lucky enough to  be born in this country and to have flourished here, the estate  tax is a reasonable and appropriate way to return something to  the common good. I'm proud to be among those supporting  preservation of this tax, which is one of the fairest taxes we have.&quot;</p>
