<p>WASHINGTON  - February 24 - Green Party activists and elected Greens in Wisconsin and Oregon are leading efforts to pass resolutions against the continued occupation of Iraq at town and city levels.&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="navigate">In California, Greens have helped introduce municipal resolutions calling for impeachment of President Bush for various abuses of power, including his decision to launch the invasion of Iraq based on deceptive evidence.</p>

              <p class="navigate">OREGON: On Tuesday, February 21, the Corvallis City Council became the first city government in Oregon to adopt a resolution calling for withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq.<br>
              <br>
              The motion passed with a 7-2 vote, under the leadership of a coalition of local Greens and Democrats working towards a common goal.  Members of the Oregon Pacific Green Party thanked Bart and Leah Bolger, two military veterans who led the effort on the Democrat side, and to Matt Donohue and George Grosch who coordinated the Green effort.  The text of the strongly worded resolution has been placed at &lt;<a href="http://www.ci.corvallis.or.us">http://www.ci.corvallis.or.us</a>&gt;.<br>

            <p class="navigate">WISCONSIN: 32 towns, villages and cities throughout Wisconsin will have a "Bring the Troops Home" question on the ballot on April 4.  Milwaukee will be the 33rd to vote on a similar resolution in November, 2006.<br>
              <br>
              Coalitions of Greens, Independents, Democrats, church groups, and peace and justice groups formed all over the state to collect the necessary petitions.  Their efforts were coordinated by the Wisconsin Green Party and the Wisconsin Network for Peace and Justice.  For a list of municipalities where voters will decide on the 'Bring Our Troops Home' question, as well as details and contact information, visit &lt;<a href="http://www.wnpj.org/homenow">http://www.wnpj.org/homenow</a>&gt;.<br>
              <br>
              The Republican Party in Wisconsin has formed a PAC to fight the initiatives.  Wisconsin Greens, concerned that there are fewer limits on campaign financing for such initiatives, are investigating whether federal tax money is being used for the
              prowar campaign.

              <p class="navigate">CALIFORNIA: On February 7, the City of San Francisco, with leadership from Supervisor and Rules Committee chair Ross Mirkarimi (Green) and other members of the Board of Supervisors, began consideration of a resolution calling for a full investigation, and impeachment or resignation of President Bush and Vice President Cheney.  On February 16, the Rules Committee recommended full board approval of a resolution from the Board of Supervisors calling for impeachment.<br>
              <br>
              In January, the City Council of Arcata passed a resolution demanding the impeachment or resignation of President Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney, citing violations of international and constitutional law.  The Resolution was written and brought before the council by Council members Dave Meserve and Harmony Groves, both Green Party members.
