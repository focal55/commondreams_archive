<p>WASHINGTON  - June 20 - The Human Rights Campaign proudly announced its support of a new Maurice Jamal film, Dirty Laundry, that is being called “groundbreaking” and “historically significant” for its candor in confronting a story of an African-American son returning home to deal with being out to his family and his church. HRC is a national sponsor of sneak preview screenings for the film across the country. 

<p>“This Maurice Jamal independent film chronicles one man’s story, but speaks to thousands of conversations happening in families across this country,” said Human Rights Campaign President Joe Solmonese. “We are extremely honored to play a role in supporting a film that openly and honestly brings to the screen issues of being out as a gay African-American man. At the end of the day, this film will sparks more conversations that will lead to the changing of hearts and minds.”

<p>Dirty Laundry is a modern-day prodigal son story with a twist. The film follows the Davis family, a traditional southern family dealing with the return of prodigal son, Patrick (Rockmond Dunbar). After 10 years, Patrick has returned to discover a secret that could rock his seemingly perfect life as a New York magazine writer.

<p>“I am so excited to be working with the Human Rights Campaign on the tour of my new film, Dirty Laundry. The film presents a view of an African-American family that we've never seen before. It's about sexuality, family, faith and redemption. It's great that the Human Rights Campaign recognized how universal this story and those themes are. From my work with their Historically Black Colleges and Universities program to Dirty Laundry they are making wonderful strides in our community,” said Maurice Jamal, writer/director of Dirty Laundry and The Ski Trip.

<p>The film comes from the creators of last year’s hit, The Ski Trip, currently airing on the Logo network. Once again, writer/director Jamal (Chappelle’s Show, Make My Day) tackles uncharted territory with his unique brand of comedy and drama. “[Jamal] is quickly becoming an important fixture in the American cinematic landscape,” said author Keith Boykin, host of BETJ’s “My Two Cents.”

<p>Dirty Laundry is currently set for previews in the following cities and festivals: Boston (June 16); New York City — Urban World Film Festival (June 22); San Francisco — International Gay and Lesbian Film Festival (June 23); Los Angeles — 24th Annual L.A. Gay and Lesbian Film Festival (July 15); Chicago — Gay Games (July 18); Miami — American Black Film Festival (July 20-23); New York City — Ebony’s Hollywood in Harlem Film Festival; Dallas — Black Academy of Arts and Letters (Aug. 26); Atlanta — In the Life Atlanta Film Festival (Sept. 2); New Orleans (Sept. 23).

<p>Press interested in attending any of the screenings above must RSVP by calling 917/334-2117 and identifying yourself as a member of the press. For more information on the film and the Human Rights Campaign’s involvement visit www.hrc.org/dirtylaundry.
