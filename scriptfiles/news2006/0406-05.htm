<p>LONDON - April 6 - Greenpeace today exposed the role played by 
McDonald's in the destruction of the Amazon rainforest. (1)

<p>As part of a new campaign to tackle the latest threat to the Amazon, 
Greenpeace has completed a year-long undercover investigation into the 
global trade in Amazon soya. The findings are today published in a new 
report, Eating up the Amazon (2).  Using satellite images, aerial 
surveillance, previously unreleased government documents and 
on-the-ground monitoring, Greenpeace traced soya from criminal 
rainforest destruction to McDonald's restaurants and to supermarkets 
across Europe.

<p>In response, this morning dozens of seven-foot-tall chickens invaded 
McDonald's restaurants across the UK and chained themselves to chairs. 
Scores of McDonald's around the country, including Leicester Square, 
London, were also fly-posted overnight with images of Ronald McDonald 
wielding a chainsaw.  In Munich, Germany, protestors also gathered at 
McDonald's European environmental affairs headquarters and called on the 
company to stop destroying the Amazon rainforest.

<p>Greenpeace forests campaign co-ordinator, Gavin Edwards, said: "Fast food giants like McDonald's are trashing the Amazon for cheap 
meat. Every time you buy a Chicken McNugget you could be taking a bite 
out of the Amazon."

<p>Three US commodities giants, Archer Daniels Midland, Bunge and Cargill, 
which control most of Europe's soya market (3), are fuelling the 
rainforest destruction to grow feed for animals in Europe. Cargill, 
which is leading the invasion, has done deals with unscrupulous farms 
that have illegally grabbed and deforested areas of public and 
indigenous land. Some have even used slave labour.

<p>Cargill has illegally built its own port in the heart of the Amazon, 
from which it exports the soya to the Cargill terminal in Liverpool, UK. 
>From there, the soya goes to Cargill-owned food producer, Sun Valley,
which feeds the soya to the chickens it uses to make McNuggets, which it 
distributes to McDonald's restaurants across Europe.

<p>A recent report in scientific journal Nature (4) warned that 40% of the 
Amazon will be lost by 2050 if current trends in agricultural expansion 
continue, threatening biodiversity and seriously contributing to climate 
change. Soya monocultures also rely heavily on toxic chemicals, and some 
also grow genetically engineered soya in the Amazon.

<p>Edwards added: "This crime stretches from the heart of the Amazon across 
the entire European food industry. Supermarkets and fast food giants, 
like McDonald's, must make sure their food is free from the links to the 
Amazon destruction, slavery and human rights abuses."

<p>Greenpeace is an independent, campaigning organisation that uses 
non-violent, creative confrontation to expose global environmental 
problems, and to force solutions essential to a green and peaceful future.



<p>Notes to Editors:

<p>(1) Greenpeace has documentary evidence that proves the following:
<p>
<ul>
<li>The soya from Amazon farms is exported from Santarém to Europe, along 
with non-Amazon soya. Cargill exported over 220,000 tonnes of Brazilian 
soya from Santarém to Liverpool in the UK from March 2005 to February 2006.</li>
<li>Greenpeace has tracked Santarém soya from Cargill's Liverpool facility 
to an animal feed producer whose chickens are processed into Chicken 
McNuggets and other products by Sun Valley. Senior Sun Valley staff told 
Greenpeace 25% of their chicken feed comes from Cargill's Liverpool 
facility.</li>
<li>Sun Valley supplies chicken to McDonald's across Europe</li>
<li>Through separate McDonald's business units in Wolverhampton and 
Orleans in France, Sun Valley is McDonald's largest poultry supplier in 
Europe, producing half of all chicken products used by McDonald's across 
Europe.</li>
<li>In a meeting last week between Greenpeace and McDonald's, the company 
did not deny that their chicken is fed on Amazon Soya. Greenpeace first 
asked McDonald's to account for their chicken feed three months ago. </li>
</ul>

A shorter crime file, based on the report: 
<a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/international/press/reports/amazon-soya-crime-file">http://www.greenpeace.org/international/press/reports/amazon-soya-crime-file</a><p>(3) Cargill, together with Archer Daniels Midland (ADM) and Bunge, 
controls 60% of soya production in Brazil and more than three-quarters 
of Europe's soya crushing industry that supplies soya meal and oil to 
the animal feed market.
