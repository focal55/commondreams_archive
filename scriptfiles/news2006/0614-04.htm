<p> WATKINS GLEN, New York - June 14 - The Unites  States Department of Agriculture (USDA) has finally admitted that  the U.S. may have its own variant of mad cow disease after  confirming two cases of mad cow disease reported in Texas and  Alabama were atypical strains of the disease. The Agency can no  longer dismiss the scientific research published in 1993 by Dr.  Richard Marsh of the University of Wisconsin that warned about  &quot;the presence of an unrecognized BSE-like disease in the United  States.&quot;</p>
<p>   &quot;Rather than heeding the evidence presented by scientists like  Dr. Richard Marsh, the USDA chose to ignore it,&quot; said Gene  Bauston, president and co-founder of Farm Sanctuary. &quot;We are  concerned that the USDA adopted a 'don't look, don't find'  approach and that an undetected disease has been incubating and  spreading as a result.&quot;</p>
<p>   Dr. Jean-Philippe Deslys, a scientist at NeuroPrion and expert  about mad cow disease, identified some possible explanations for  the new variant. He outlined several scenarios in the  agribusiness newsletter, &quot;Meatingplace.com&quot;: &quot;that the 'classic'  BSE infection has mutated, much like a virus; that these cases  are linked to scrapie in sheep or are truly spontaneous like most  CJD (Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease) cases in humans and present  little or no infective risk; or most ominously, that a new  pattern of infectivity has emerged and may not be identified for  years.&quot;</p>
<p>   Agribusiness and government spokespersons want to assume the  least risky scenario, says Farm Sanctuary. They hope that the  Texas and Alabama findings are &quot;spontaneous cases,&quot; which are  believed to naturally afflict approximately one in one million  cattle. There is no legitimate scientific basis for that  assumption. Bauston states, &quot;Rather than dismissing a mounting  bed of troubling evidence, the USDA needs to carefully  investigate it, and deal with this issue openly and honestly.&quot;</p>
<p>   Downed animals, those too sick to stand, are among the most  likely to be afflicted with mad cow disease or a variant of it.  Farm Sanctuary has campaigned to ban the sale of downed animals  since 1986. In 1998, Farm Sanctuary petitioned the USDA to ban  downed animal slaughter. The USDA formally denied the petition in  1999. Farm Sanctuary then filed a lawsuit to ban downed animals.  The case was dismissed, but a federal appellate court reinstated  the case on Dec. 16, 2003, about one week before mad cow disease  was discovered in the U.S. After this discovery, the USDA  published an emergency rule banning the processing of downer  cattle, but excluding all other downed animal species (e.g.  pigs). At the time, the USDA suggested that a final rule would be  forthcoming, but to date, no final rule has ever been issued  despite widespread public and Congressional support for such a  policy. Since this time, and with every new case of mad cow  disease announced in the U.S., Farm Sanctuary has reiterated its  call for a permanent ban on all downed animals entering the human  food supply.</p>
<p>   Farm Sanctuary is the nation's leading farm animal protection  organization. Since incorporating in 1986, they have worked to  expose and stop cruel practices of the &quot;food animal&quot; industry  through research and investigations, legal and legislative  actions, public awareness projects, youth education, and direct  rescue and refuge efforts. Their shelters in Watkins Glen, N.Y.,  and Orland, Calif., provide lifelong care for hundreds of rescued  animals, who have become ambassadors for farm animals everywhere  by educating visitors about the realities of factory farming.
