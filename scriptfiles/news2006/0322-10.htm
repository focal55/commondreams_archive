<p>WASHINGTON - March 22 - The National Gay and Lesbian Task Force applauds Equality Utah, a grassroots, statewide political advocacy organization that promotes lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) equality, for its work to successfully turn back several anti-LGBT bills introduced in the 2006 Utah Legislature.

<p>Only one of the five bills opposed by Equality Utah was passed by the Legislature, and that measure — which would have blocked courts from granting caretaking rights to non-biological parents (in turn hurting many nontraditional families, including LGBT families) — was vetoed late last night by Gov. Jon Huntsman Jr.

<p><b>Statement by Matt Foreman, Executive Director, National Gay and Lesbian Task Force</b>
<p>"The dogged determination of our grassroots ally Equality Utah, its executive director Mike Thompson, and all Utahans who took action against the discriminatory, anti-LGBT bills put forth in the Utah Legislature is extraordinary, and serves as a model to us all. Congratulations on this amazing success. This is a tremendous day for all Utahans — and all Americans — who support fairness and equality."
