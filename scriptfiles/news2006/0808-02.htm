<p>WASHINGTON - August 8 - <p><b>What: </b><br>
NOW President Kim Gandy will be in Connecticut today campaigning for Ned Lamont for United States Senate. The leader of the nation's leading women's rights organization will be talking with Connecticut women about why Ned Lamont is the best candidate for women, and why the National Organization for Women was the first national organization to endorse him. 
<p><b>When:<br>
</b> Tuesday, August 8th 
<p><b>Where:</b> <br>
Greater Hartford and central Connecticut. 



<p>"Ned Lamont knows what is at stake for women if the Administration and Congress continue on their current disastrous course. He understands the issues that concern women every day -- from education to health care to reproductive rights to the war in Iraq -- and he's strong enough to stand up for those principles despite enormous pressure from the extremists and the hawks in Congress," said Gandy.

<p>"Ned Lamont knows that allowing Samuel Alito's Supreme Court confirmation vote to proceed in the Senate has put Roe v. Wade in extreme jeopardy. We needed a strong voice for reproductive rights in the Senate then, and we will need it in the future. That's why NOW PAC is working for Ned Lamont."

<p>To interview Ms. Gandy or learn more about her schedule, call Mai Shiozaki, cell 202-641-1906 or 202-641-1902.
