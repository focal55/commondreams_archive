<p>WASHINGTON - July 13 -    
    



On July 17, 2006, a delegation of more than 200 people from throughout the United States will re-enter the United States after traveling to Cuba, challenging U.S. laws that impinge on U.S. citizens’ constitutional freedom to travel to the island.  They have been on the island since July 2, and are crossing the U.S.-Canada border on the 17th.  This year’s challenge takes on added significance in the wake of the unprecedented government response to last year’s travel challenges; upon returning from the island, nearly 200 participants received letters from the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets and Control (OFAC) requesting personal and group information, and threatening fines. This is the first time that letters were sent en masse to travel challengers. Although travel to Cuba has been restricted since 1961, not until now has the U.S. government taken such a harsh stance.

<p>The travel challenge comes at a time of renewed tension between the two countries’ governments.  This week, the U.S. State Department group Commission for Assistance to a Free Cuba released a report that urges the U.S. government to intervene in the event of Castro’s death or ouster.  The report recommends creating an $80 million fund to promote U.S. programs in Cuba, and an annex to the report includes proposals on how the U.S. government could undermine Castro.  Cuban officials are incensed at the report, likening it to a declaration of war.  In the midst of this standoff, 200 U.S. citizens will travel to Cuba to meet with regular Cubans, hear their perspectives on the matter, and deliver humanitarian aid.  This trip is illegal under U.S. law.
    
<p>U.S. citizens have been prevented from traveling to Cuba since 1961. The travel restrictions were lifted under the Carter administration in 1977, and then re-imposed under President Reagan in 1982. In the past 2 years, the Bush administration tightened the travel restrictions, eliminating many licenses for nonprofit groups that were able to bring Americans to Cuba legally and cutting the number of visits Cuban Americans are allowed to make to the island to one visit every three years.
    
<p>“It is the Constitutional right of every American to travel to where they please without permission from the U.S. government. This ban is antiquated and not only violates the rights of Americans but also hurts Cubans, who are already suffering under a U.S. embargo that causes shortages of food, medicine and other important supplies,” said Bonnie Massie of the Venceremos Brigade. Venceremos Brigade is organizing the travel challenge caravan through Canada. A separate caravan, organized by the interfaith group Pastors for Peace, will travel through Mexico.  

<p>Of the OFAC warning she received, Tshaka Barrows of Oakland California, a repeat traveler, said that “the letters we received last year have inspired us to return.  The U.S. government doesn't want the public at large to know what they are wasting our tax dollars on.  It's time to call their bluff."
    
<p>The effects of U.S. policy on Cuba reaches far beyond travel.  After Hurricane Katrina, Cuba offered 1500 bi-lingual doctors as a good faith gesture.  The United States declined.  Cuba Currently has over 20,000 doctors serving for free around the world, more than the World Health Organization. 
     
<p>Similar travel restrictions do not apply to other communist countries.  U.S. citizens are allowed by our government to visit China and Vietnam, among others.
