<p>WASHINGTON - October 27  - 
<p><a href="http://www.co.leon.fl.us/elect" target="_new"><strong>Ion Sancho</strong></a>, <a href="mailto:ion@leoncountyfl.gov">ion@leoncountyfl.gov</a>: Available for a limited number of interviews, Sancho is elections 
supervisor for Leon County in Florida. He said today: "Florida's new 
statewide voter registration database may result in thousands of 
Floridians not being allowed to vote despite their good-faith efforts to 
register to vote. The three previous efforts by Florida Secretaries of 
State to create accurate databases determining the eligibility of 
voters, in 1998, 2000, and 2004, were abysmal failures. We'll all find 
out how good this database is on November 7, 2006." Sancho will be in 
New York City on Sunday and Monday.

<p>See: "<a href="http://www.floridatoday.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20061025/BREAKINGNEWS/61025039/1086" target="_new"><i>Documentary to Examine Ballot Security</i></a>" in Florida Today: 


<p><strong><a href="http://www.brennancenter.org" target="_new">Justin Levitt</a></strong>, <a href="mailto:justin.levitt@nyu.edu">justin.levitt@nyu.edu</a>: 
    Associate counsel with the Democracy Program at the Brennan Center, 
Levitt said today: "We remain concerned that problems with the voter 
rolls will impact eligible citizens, and we urge voters who encounter 
problems at the polls to persevere in the face of administrative 
difficulties. People should not be discouraged if their names are not 
found in the poll book -- at a minimum, they should demand a provisional 
ballot.

<p>"For the first time this year, each state is required to have a 
computerized statewide voter list, replacing what had been local lists 
of varying quality. These new systems are extremely large and extremely 
complex, and were put together at an aggressive pace; as with any 
complex technology project, there could well be glitches in the first 
big test this election.

<p>"Moreover, particular state procedures are likely to cause problems 
for some voters. For example, eligible citizens may have problems 
getting on the rolls in states like North Carolina or South Dakota, 
which require that a voter's registration information match information 
on the motor vehicles or Social Security database before the voter can 
be registered to vote. Typos and other inconsistencies could prevent 
eligible voters from getting on the rolls. The Brennan Center 
successfully litigated a case in Washington state on this issue, but 
problems remain elsewhere around the country. In Florida, if 
registration information doesn't 'match,' the voter must vote a 
provisional ballot, and return to the office of the county supervisor 
within three days with documentary proof of a driver's license or Social 
Security number. And states like Ohio have not publicized their 
practices, and could well be implementing versions of these 'no match, 
no vote' rules.

<p>"Other procedures may create problems with purges of eligible 
citizens. As states consolidate local lists statewide, they are also 
attempting to remove duplicate or ineligible entries, on a greatly 
expanded scale. Such cleaning is laudable, but must not sweep eligible 
voters out in the process. We remain concerned that purges undertaken 
without public scrutiny, and under pressure from federal officials, may 
cause eligible citizens to be struck from the lists. Given that most of 
these purges are poorly publicized, we may only find out about the 
problems with the purges for the first time on Election Day."

<p><a href="http://www.freepress.org/index2.php" target="_new"><strong>Harvey Wasserman</strong></a>, <a href="mailto:harvey@freepress.org">harvey@freepress.org</a>: Wasserman co-authored the book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1595580697?tag=commondreams-20/ref=nosim" target="_new">"What Happened in Ohio?"</a> and has 
co-written the recent piece "Will Ken Blackwell find the ways to steal 
Ohio 2006 as he did in 2004?" which states: "Since 2000, under 
Blackwell's supervision, Boards of Elections in Cincinnati, Columbus, 
Cleveland and Toledo have eliminated some 500,000 voters from their 
registration rolls. Nearly all are in heavily Democratic urban areas. In 
a state where some 5.6 million people voted for president in 2004, this 
represents nearly 10 percent of the electorate."
