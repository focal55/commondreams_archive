<p>WASHINGTON - November 2 - Congressman Dennis J. Kucinich (D-OH), today, sent a bipartisan Ohio delegation letter to Lockheed Martin Corp. CEO Robert Stevens urging Lockheed to hire local workers for contract and subcontract work the company will be doing for NASA Glenn.

<p>The letter, the latest bipartisan effort led by Kucinich for NASA Glenn, was signed by Reps. Kucinich (D-OH), LaTourette (R-OH), Ryan (D-OH), Regula (R-OH), Tubbs Jones (D-OH), Hobson (R-OH), Kaptur (D-OH), Brown (D-OH), Chabot (R-OH), Strickland (D-OH), Schmidt (R-OH) Tiberi (R-OH), Oxley (R-OH), Pryce (R-OH), Turner (R-OH), Gilmore (R-OH).</p>
<p>Despite the election year partisanship that has overtaken Washington and Ohio, Kucinich has been able to unite the Ohio delegation, from North to South, to protect NASA Glenn and its workers. </p>
<p>“I want to thank my colleagues for joining me in this effort,” stated Kucinich. “I will continue to work with all my colleagues to ensure NASA Glenn workers are protected and NASA Glenn remains a strong and vital part of NASA’s long-term plans.”</p>
<p>The Kucinich letter, sent today, states:</p>
<p>Mr. Robert Stevens<br>Chief Executive Officer<br>Lockheed Martin Corporation<br>6801 Rockledge Drive<br>Bethesda, MD 20817</p>
<p>Dear Mr. Stevens: </p>
<p>We, the members of Ohio’s Congressional delegation, congratulate you and the employees of Lockheed Martin on being awarded the NASA contract for Project Orion, also known as the Crew Exploration Vehicle.&nbsp; As home to the NASA Glenn Research Center, Ohio will serve a critical role in the management of Project Orion.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>Ohio has a skilled labor force and manufacturers that have previously proven themselves on multiple NASA flight projects.&nbsp; When combined with NASA Glenn’s experienced federal workforce and world-class facilities, Ohio is a clear choice for the location of additional contract and sub-contract work in the design, development, manufacturing and testing of major elements of Orion.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Moreover, Ohio is eager to host a portion of these operations.&nbsp; We understand that NASA and Lockheed Martin are completing work plans that will finalize locations for operations associated with the Orion Project.&nbsp; We hope you will work with Ohio’s public and private sector representatives in the coordination of your planning.&nbsp; We greatly appreciate your attention on this matter, and look forward to working with you in furthering the mission of NASA and Project Orion in Ohio.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
