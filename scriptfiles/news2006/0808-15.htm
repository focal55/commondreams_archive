<p>WASHINGON - August 8 - Two human rights groups today 
				commended the UN Secretary-General's continued attention to the 
				need for accountability for past human rights crimes in 
				Timor-Leste, but called his proposals to the Security Council 
				&quot;inadequate.&quot; </p>
				<p align="left">The East Timor and Indonesia Action Network 
				(ETAN) and <a target="_blank" href="http://tapol.gn.apc.org/">
				TAPOL, the Indonesia Human Rights Campaign</a>, said that the 
				recently-released
				<a target="_blank" href="http://www.unotil.org/UNMISETwebsite.nsf/p9999/$FILE/JRRPT.pdf">
				report by the Secretary-General on justice and reconciliation 
				for Timor-Leste </a>offers only modest proposals to deal with 
				the lack of accountability for human rights crimes committed in 
				Timor-Leste in 1999 and ignores pre-1999 crimes entirely. </p>
				<p align="left">“We welcome the Secretary General's continued 
				attention to the need for justice for the East Timorese. 
				Unfortunately, however, he demonstrates a reluctance to 
				discharge the UN’s special responsibility for justice for 
				Timor-Leste since Indonesia invaded in 1975,” said Paul Barber, 
				advocacy officer of TAPOL. “His recommendations are almost 
				entirely dependent on the judicial systems and political will of 
				Indonesia and Timor-Leste. This continues a strategy that has 
				manifestly been shown to fail.” </p>
				<p align="left">&quot;The UN should be taking more forceful actions 
				toward accountability,” said John M. Miller, National 
				Coordinator of ETAN. “Indonesia has ignored repeated calls to 
				cooperate with international efforts to achieve justice. The 
				government of Timor-Leste, wary of its dominant neighbour, 
				remains reluctant to demand that the Indonesian organizers and 
				perpetrators of crimes against humanity be held accountable.&quot;
				</p>
				<p align="left">The SG’s report calls for the revival of 
				international support for investigations and indictments of 
				serious crimes committed in 1999, when Timor-Leste voted for 
				independence, but specifically rules out the resumption of the 
				prosecutorial component of the UN-established Serious Crimes 
				Unit in Timor-Leste. It notes that a substantial number of 
				crimes committed in 1999 have yet to be investigated or 
				prosecuted and over 300 of those already indicted are in 
				Indonesia, out of the reach of Timor-Leste's courts. </p>
				<p align="left">&quot;Internal reconciliation within Timor-Leste and 
				completion of investigations into the crimes of 1999 are 
				important to establishing the groundwork for future 
				prosecutions, but these efforts must have adequate resources to 
				finish the job,&quot; said Miller. &quot;Relying on voluntary 
				contributions, as recommended, may leave the job incomplete yet 
				again.&quot; The report calls for a &quot;solidarity fund... for the 
				purpose of funding a community restoration programme and a 
				justice programme in Timor-Leste.&quot; </p>
				<p align="left">&quot;The report calls for the Security Council to 
				endorse the findings of the
				<a href="http://www.etan.org/etanpdf/pdf3/N0542617.pdf">
				Commission of Experts</a> (COE), but fails to address most of 
				its recommendations and those of Timor-Leste's
				<a href="http://etan.org/news/2006/02indo.htm">Commission for 
				Reception, Truth and Reconciliation</a> (CAVR), including its 
				call that a UN-backed serious crimes process investigate 
				exemplary pre-1999 cases,&quot; said Barber. </p>
				<p align="left">The Secretary-General's report was requested by 
				the Security Council in September 2005. In it the SG provides 
				his views on the reports of his COE and the CAVR , as well as on 
				the creation of the joint Timor-Leste-Indonesia Commission of 
				Truth and Friendship (CTF). The SG report includes 
				recommendations on the issue, some of which may be included in 
				the next UN mission to Timor-Leste now under consideration by 
				the Security Council. </p>
				<p align="left">&quot;The SG while endorsing the findings of the COE 
				concerning the inadequacies of Indonesia's Ad Hoc Court, would 
				put only the mildest pressure on Indonesia to prosecute suspects 
				in Indonesia or to cooperate with Timorese or international 
				efforts,&quot; said Barber. “Experience has shown that this is not a 
				credible solution to the problem.” </p>
				<p align="left">The report acknowledges both governments’ 
				reluctance to pursue prosecutions of Indonesian officials and 
				recommends that the Security Council ”welcome&quot; the CTF despite 
				its serious shortcomings, including its ability to recommend 
				amnesties, but not prosecutions. </p>
				<p align="left">“The Council should not offer its support to the 
				CTF at least until its terms of reference are strengthened to 
				conform with international standards on accountability and the 
				denial of impunity,” said Miller. </p>
				<p align="left">The COE reported on the Serious Crimes process 
				in Timor-Leste and was particularly harsh in its criticism of 
				the proceedings of Jakarta's ad hoc human rights court. The COE 
				expressed reservations about the CTF and called for giving 
				Indonesia a limited period of time to credibly prosecute senior 
				military officials who had already been indicted in Timor-Leste; 
				the COE called for the creation of an international tribunal 
				should Indonesia fail to do so. </p>
				<p align="left">The CAVR, an independent Timorese body which 
				began work under the UN administration, issued its 2,500-page 
				report on 31 October 2005. Its report covered human rights 
				violations from 1974-1999. The CAVR also endorsed an 
				international tribunal, as well as calling for reparations from 
				countries, including the permanent members of the Security 
				Council, which backed Indonesia's invasion and occupation. The 
				CAVR called for wide dissemination and discussion of its report 
				throughout the UN, as well as among member states including 
				Indonesia. The CAVR report states “Egregious as they were, 
				however, the crimes committed in 1999 were far outweighed by 
				those committed during the previous 24 years of occupation…” The 
				SG's report praised international assistance to help the post-CAVR 
				Technical Secretariat distribute the report’s findings within 
				Timor-Leste. </p>
				<p align="left">On July 21, three coalitions of NGOs concerned 
				with the transitional justice process in Timor-Leste, wrote the 
				Secretary-General that &quot;severe shortcomings of the local and 
				international justice processes have helped to create a culture 
				of impunity in which a range of actors believe they can, in 
				effect, get away with murder and other crimes,&quot; and called for a 
				reconstitution of the Serious Crimes process.
				<a href="http://etan.org/news/2006/07justice.htm">The letter</a> 
				was signed on behalf of the Timor-Leste National Alliance for an 
				International Tribunal; the Australian Coalition for 
				Transitional Justice in East Timor and the International 
				Federation for East Timor, which includes both TAPOL and ETAN.
				</p>
				<p align="left">ETAN, based in the U.S., advocates for 
				democracy, justice and human rights for Timor-Leste and 
				Indonesia. ETAN supports an international tribunal to prosecute 
				crimes against humanity committed in Timor-Leste from 1975 to 
				1999 and for restrictions on U.S. military assistance to 
				Indonesia until there is genuine reform of its security forces.
				</p>
				<p align="left">The British-based TAPOL - which means political 
				prisoner in Indonesian - was founded in 1973 and is a leading 
				English language authority on the human rights situation in 
				Indonesia and Timor-Leste.</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
