<p>MADISON, Wisconsin - December 14 - <font size="2" face="Arial">A record nine wolves, including four that were wearing radio collars, were killed during this year’s gun deer hunting season, prompting conservation groups to contribute to the reward fund for information leading to the arrest of the persons responsible for these illegal killings. The Timber Wolf Alliance is contributing $1,000, and Defenders of Wildlife is offering an additional $1,000 per incident, on top of the $2,000 reward from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Wolves are protected under the Endangered Species Act, and federal law prohibits killing wolves in Wisconsin. </font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">"These killings mar an otherwise positive conservation story in a state that is proud of its natural heritage," said Adrian Wydeven, conservation biologist with the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (DNR). "The wolf's recovery here in Wisconsin is truly a success story, and now it seems we’re taking a step backwards with these killings."</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">According to state and federal wildlife officials, this year's gun deer hunting season has brought a dramatic increase in the number of wolf shootings. Before this year, the record number of wolves killed in a single hunting season was five, in 2002. Last year, two wolves were reported killed, and in 2004 just one was shot.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">"We've seen almost twice as many wolves killed this year, compared to 2002," said Gina Schrader, conservation associate with Defenders of Wildlife. "Our children deserve to inherit a world where wolves roam the wild, places where wildlife persists without persecution."</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Wolves were nearly eliminated from Wisconsin after years of predator control bounties and habitat loss. With the help of federal protections, wolf populations have rebounded. Today, wildlife officials estimate that there are 465 wolves in 115 packs across the state; however, it is still against the law to take a Wisconsin wolf.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">"By posting rewards, we are telling the citizens of Wisconsin that we take illegal wolf killings very seriously," said Pam Troxell, coordinator of the Timber Wolf Alliance.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Defenders of Wildlife's contribution comes from its Endangered Species Reward Fund, established in 1997 to bring illegal predator-killers to justice. The Timber Wolf Alliance's contribution comes from private donations.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Tips on the wolf killings can be made anonymously through the Wisconsin DNR by calling 1-800-847-9367. For more information, please visit the Wisconsin DNR website.</font></p>
