<p>WASHINGTON - June 28 - <p>   WHAT:   Peace is Patriotic Rally.  The Granny Peace Brigade, a  group of 18 patriotic grandmothers aged 60-91, who were arrested  and sent to jail in October for trying to enlist themselves at a  military recruiting station in peaceful protest of the Iraq war,  are on an historic trek from NYC to DC.  They are making this  arduous journey to help citizens along the way visibly and  audibly demand that the troops be brought home now.</p>
<p>   Peace Grannies of Sandy Spring, five of whom were arrested in  February at a peaceful anti-war protest, will welcome the NY  grannies in a special ceremony.  One of the local grannies is  Irene Mensalves, 102 years old.</p>

<p>   The rally will also include musical performances by the Granny  Peace Brigade (one of whom is a Broadway choreographer); a speech  by Donna Edwards, a candidate challenging Rep. Al Wynn in the  Democratic primary; and the kick-off of Montgomery County's Peace  Voter Pledge Campaign.</p>
<p>   WHEN: Sunday, July 2, 3 to 5 p.m.</p>
<p>   WHERE:  Sandy Spring Friends Meeting House Grounds, 17715  Meetinghouse Road, Sandy Spring, MD</p>
<p>   WHO: Sponsored  by PeaceAction Montgomery and the Peace  Committee of the Sandy Spring Friends Meeting.</p>
<p>   PHOTO OP &amp; VISUALS:  Grandmothers in wheelchairs, with canes  and banners continue their &quot;march&quot; against the Iraq War from New  York
