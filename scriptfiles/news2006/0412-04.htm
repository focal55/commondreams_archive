<p>WASHINGTON - April 12 - Citizens for  Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) has prepared an  ethics complaint against Rep. William Jefferson (D-La.) regarding  his role in a conspiracy and bribery scheme as well as for  misusing federal resources in the wake of hurricane Katrina. Last  fall, CREW named Jefferson as one of the 13 most corrupt Members  of Congress. </p>
<p>   CREW is asking that a Member of the House forward the  complaint against Rep. Jefferson to the House Committee on  Standards of Official Conduct, better known as the House Ethics  Committee. CREW is not submitting the complaint to the Ethics  Committee directly because outside groups are barred from filing  complaints. The rules allow a Member of the House to certify that  CREW's complaint has a good faith basis and forward the complaint  to the Ethics Committee, stating that the complaint merits the  Committee's consideration. </p>
<p>   CREW based much of its complaint on information revealed in  the plea agreement of Rep. Jefferson's former legislative  assistant, Brett Pfeffer. In court documents, Pfeffer stated that  in 2004, he was employed as President of an investment company  and worked with Rep. Jefferson and another company, iGate Inc.,  to market high-speed internet and broadband services in Nigeria.  Rep. Jefferson apparently agreed to use his position as a Member  of Congress to promote the Nigerian deal in return for favors  bestowed upon his family members. In addition, Jefferson received  significant campaign contributions from iGate's CEO, Vernon  Jackson, and Jackson's wife. Jackson and iGate also made campaign  contributions to Rep. Jefferson's daughter, Louisiana state Rep.  Jalila Jefferson-Bullock. </p>
<p>   In order to further a deal in Ghana similar to the Nigerian  deal, Rep. Jefferson traveled to that country with official  staff, a member of his extended family and an employee of  Pfeffer's. He again used his official position to promote the  deal, in exchange for a percentage of the Ghanian company and a  position within that company for his family members. </p>
<p>   Finally, Rep. Jefferson improperly used federal resources  during the mayhem following Hurricane Katrina by using National  Guard troops to check on his home and retrieve some of his  belongings. </p>
<p>   "Rep. Jefferson's conduct shows a blatant disregard for the  rule of law and the integrity of the House of Representatives."  Melanie Sloan, executive director of CREW, said today. "We urge a  member of the House to ignore the long-standing ethics truce and  file CREW's complaint with the House Ethics Committee today." </p>
<p>   A copy of CREW's complaint is available on its website,  <a href="http://releases.usnewswire.com/redir.asp?ReleaseID=63941&Link=http://www.citizensforethics.org">http://www.citizensforethics.org</a>. </p>
