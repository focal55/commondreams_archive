<p>WASHINGTON - August 22 - On August 22, 2006, Iran formally responded to a proposal from the P5+1 (Britain, China, France, Russia, United States + Germany) seeking to resolve the dispute over the country’s nuclear program. What does Iran’s response mean for the future of negotiations? Was the proposal from the P5+1 fair and adequate? How is the United Nations Security Council likely to respond?
