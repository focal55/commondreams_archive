<p>NEW YORK - March 22 - Today a three-judge panel heard arguments from attorneys representing Guantánamo detainees in the District of Columbia Circuit Court of Appeals (Al Odah v. United States of America and Boumediene v. Bush). They asked the panel to reject the Government's effort to have the cases dismissed. CCR won the Supreme Court case establishing the detainees' right to challenge their detention in U.S. court (Rasul v. Bush), and currently oversees more than 500 pro-bono attorneys representing the detainees.

 

<p><b>Barbara Olshansky</b>, CCR Deputy Legal Director who attended oral arguments today stated:

 

<p><i>Despite the governments effort to the contrary, I feel that the Court understood the great importance of preserving the writ of habeas corpus. Their questions about ensuring the Courts ability to consider factual evidence of innocence made clear that justice is their true concern.
</i>
<p>Olshansky expects a ruling from the Court in the next few weeks.

 

<p>According to recent estimates, the government is currently detaining about 490 prisoners at the Guantánamo Bay prison camp. CCR is working around the clock to achieve their release to freedom or a fair trial.
