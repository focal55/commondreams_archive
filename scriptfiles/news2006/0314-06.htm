<p>WASHINGTON - March 14 - A massive outcry in defense of water for people and the planet is brewing. As
official governmental bodies, influential world players such as the World Bank and the
International Monetary Fund, and some of the largest global water and energy
corporations prepare for the Fourth World Water Forum in Mexico City, grassroots
organizations are creating an alternative space to hear the voices of people who have been
shut-out of the “official” Forum.
<p>Between March 14th and March 22nd, thousands of people will join open forums,
seminars, workshops, protests and cultural events to defend the fundamental human right
to clean, affordable water. These events call for water to be recognized as part of the
global commons and call for new visions of community and public management of water.
According to Anil Naidoo from the Council of Canadians, "Planning these
alternative events has really been a democratic process. Groups from all parts of society,
from all parts of the globe, have pooled their energy and resources – many diverse
perspectives have not only been included in the events but just as importantly, in the
process.” The Council of Canadians has been a leader in the international effort to
organize alternative events.
<p>Rallies in Defense of Water have been organized by and for indigenous and
campesino organizations, community groups, human rights groups, academics, trade
unions, students, grassroots organizations, women’s groups, public health advocates, and
social movements from within Mexico. The events highlight the voices of those who face
a dire global water crisis daily - a lack of adequate sanitation, rising water rates, and
displacement from dams. However, many of these communities have successfully built
an alternative vision that puts health and human rights before profits, and they have built
local, community-based institutions to defend this vision.
<p>Unfortunately, few of these institutions, groups and visions are represented inside
the Fourth World Water Forum. International groups have been shocked by the lack of
cooperation on behalf of the Fourth World Water Forum and the Mexican government to
incorporate alternative viewpoints in the program and activities of the official planning.
The Fourth World Water Forum is dominated by corporate interests, North
American and European governments, agencies and international financial institutions.
Despite rhetoric of participation and inclusion, the registration fee of $240-$600 US
dollars excludes public participation at the Forum. International activists have faced a
lack of support from both conference convenors and the Mexican government in
obtaining visas, effectively excluding activists from attendance.
<p>In contrast, private corporations and groups such as the World Water Council
have played a strong role in the conference planning. The Council is a private think tank
headed by the CEO of a subsidiary of the transnational water giant Suez. Conference
convenors have continued to promote privatization, despite numerous examples of
private sector failures over the past year, from Argentina to Bolivia, and community
opposition to private sector involvement.
<p>“Over the last 10 years, the privatisation of water has been a disaster for the
world’s poor – causing rate hikes, poor service, and water cutoffs. The movers and
shakers within the Fourth World Water Forum need to hear from those civil society
groups around the world who have been struggling against the corporate control of water
resources,” says Tamsyn East from the World Development Movement, which has been
fighting European governments who promote privatization around the world.
<p>Because of these failures, international grassroots activists present at the
alternative events have a deep and growing revulsion to any attempts to place control
over water in the hands of transnational corporations, governments and international
organizations. Activists have seen the failure of these global water players to secure the
fundamental human right of safe, clean, affordable water for all.
<p>Rallies in Defense of Water condemn the Fourth World Water Forum for
promoting water as a negotiable commodity to be bought and sold on the international
marketplace. The alternative events condemn the exclusionary nature of the official
Forum. In response and offering a truly democratic alternative, international grassroots
activists are bringing together people from across the world to defend water as a common
good and a public trust for all people and for the planet.
<p>The Mexican movement, Asamblea Nacional en Defensa del Agua y la Tierra y
en contra de su privatización has spearheaded the organizing efforts in Mexico City.
"The Fourth World Water Forum says its theme is "local actions," but they have not even
helped local groups right here in Mexico, the host country, participate. There is an urgent
need to create alternative spaces for groups to express their struggles and solutions," says
Brenda Rodríguez, the spokeswoman of Coalición de Organizaciones por el Derecho de
Agua, which is a founder and active member of the Asamblea.
