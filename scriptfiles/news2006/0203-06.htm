<p>WASHINGTON - February 3 - MoveOn.org Political Action will launch a nationwide TV ad campaign on Monday accusing President Bush of breaking the law by wiretapping American citizens without warrants. The ad draws a parallel between Bush's actions and those of former President Nixon.  It quotes Nixon's Watergate self-defense: &quot;When the President does it, that means it's not illegal.&quot;</p>
<p>   The group will call for a special prosecutor to investigate the wiretap program, citing Attorney General Alberto Gonzales' conflict of interest.  Gonzales has made numerous television appearances defending the President's right to eavesdrop on Americans at home without warrants. He is scheduled to testify in defense of the program in front of the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee on Monday.</p>
<p>   &quot;No one is above the law, not even the President,&quot; said Eli Pariser, executive director of MoveOn Political Action. &quot;As Richard Nixon discovered, that's not the way our country works.&quot;</p>
<p>   &quot;The President already has the legal authority to wiretap terrorists and we, like most Americans, support that. But the President acted beyond that authority and broke the law. If he believes he needs additional authority, he should go to Congress for it,&quot; Pariser added.</p>
<p>   &quot;MoveOn members are pleased to join prominent conservative Republicans, including Bob Barr and Grover Norquist, who have also said that the President is breaking the law,&quot; Pariser concluded.</p>
