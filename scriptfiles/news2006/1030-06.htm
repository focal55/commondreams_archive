<p>WASHINGTON - October 30 - Approximately 325 Amnesty International USA (AIUSA) activists  and supporters will gather this weekend for AIUSA's 2006 Southern  Regional Conference, &quot;Bringing Human Rights Home.&quot; The conference  will take place at the Radisson Hotel at the New Orleans Airport  November 3-5.
<p>   &quot;We are having this year's conference in the great city of New  Orleans to stand in solidarity with the people of the Gulf who  are still demanding their human rights in the wake of Hurricane  Katrina,&quot; said Jared Feuer, Director of AIUSA's Southern Regional  Office.   &quot;This weekend will be about informing and inspiring our  members regarding pressing domestic and international human  rights abuses facing our world today, from Darfur, to Guantanamo,  to New Orleans.&quot;</p>
<p>   Conference sessions will address topics including torture,  violence against women, the crisis in Darfur, working with trauma  survivors and economic, social and cultural rights. On Saturday  morning there will be a post-Katrina Solidarity Bus Tour and  panel on the human rights crisis in the Gulf. The tour through  New Orleans will be guided by local community members and have an  advocacy component.
