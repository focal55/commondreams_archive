<p>WASHINGTON - March 10 - Human Rights Campaign President Joe Solmonese made the following statement today regarding news that the Boston Catholic Charities was halting its adoption program because of a state law allowing children in need of a home to be adopted by gay and lesbian parents.

<p>“Denying children a loving and stable home serves absolutely no higher purpose,” said Solmonese. “These bishops are putting an ugly political agenda before the needs of very vulnerable children. Every one of the nation’s leading children’s welfare groups agrees that a parent’s sexual orientation is irrelevant to his or her ability to raise a child. What these bishops are doing is shameful, wrong and has nothing to do whatsoever with faith.”

<p>The Human Rights Campaign is the largest national lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender political organization with members throughout the country. It effectively lobbies Congress, provides campaign support and educates the public to ensure that LGBT Americans can be open, honest and safe at home, at work and in the community.
