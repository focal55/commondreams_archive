<p>   <b>WHAT: </b>Center on Budget and Policy Priorities Conference Call:  JOINT TAX COMMITTEE ESTIMATE UNMASKS GIMMICK PLANNED FOR USE IN  TAX-CUT BILL: Approach Would Add New Tax Cuts to &quot;Pay For&quot; Other  Tax Cuts </p>

<p>   <b>WHO: </b></p>
<p>   -- Robert Greenstein, executive director, CBPP </p>
<p>   -- Joel Friedman, senior fellow, CBPP </p>
<p>   The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities will hold a  conference call briefing on Wednesday, April 26 at 12 p.m. (ET)  to discuss two significant budget gimmicks that the Congressional  Leadership plans to place in the forthcoming conference report on  the tax reconciliation bill.  Senate rules bar reconciliation  bills that increase long-term deficits.  The gimmicks, which rest  on timing shifts, would make it appear as though the bill would  not enlarge long-term deficits when that is precisely what the  bill would do. </p>
<p>   Further, the gimmicks themselves are tax cuts which raise  revenue in the short run but lose larger amounts of revenue in  the long run.  Thus, the conference reports would be adding tax  cuts to pay for other tax cuts. </p>
<p>   The conference call briefing will include examination of a  Joint Tax Committee estimate that has just come to light, and  that shows the gimmicks to be cynical attempts to mask the  legislation's long-term impacts. </p>
<p>   The briefers also will explain that use of the gimmicks poses  a basic test of integrity for Senate Budget Committee chairman  Judd Gregg, who will rule on whether the bill should be  acknowledged to increase long-term deficits or whether to  maintain there is no such effect despite the fact that all  analysts know otherwise.  Senator Gregg has been outspoken of  late about Congress' willingness to manipulate budget rules to  increase spending and enlarge deficits.  Will he take a  consistent stand with respect to efforts to manipulate budget  rules to pass deficit-financed tax cuts, or will he now bend the  rules himself? </p>
<p>   After opening remarks, the panelists will take questions. </p>
