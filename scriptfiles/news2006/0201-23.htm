<p>WASHINGTON - February 1 - As President Bush touted the benefits of free trade in his State of the 
Union address, protests filled the streets of San Salvador on January 31 
in the latest of a string of events demonstrating the continued failure 
of the US-Dominican Republic-Central America Free Trade Agreement 
(DR-CAFTA). The Bush Administration had hoped to celebrate the 
implementation of CAFTA on January 1, but was forced to delay the start 
date until at least February. Now, even hopes of a March 1 date seem 
remote, and social movements are reinvigorated in their struggles to 
continue mobilizing against the worst aspects of the agreement, and to 
ultimately thwart the implementation process.

<p>In recent weeks the US Trade Representative has been insisting that the 
six countries involved in the agreement go beyond the original 
provisions, especially in the areas intellectual property rights and 
sanitary regulations. In particular, US-based pharmaceutical companies 
have demanded legal changes in the Central American countries that would 
prevent generic drug companies from manufacturing low-cost medicines. 
The government of Guatemala has been particularly adamant in opposing 
such measures, and the vice-president has gone as far as to threaten to 
pull the country out of CAFTA if the USTR does not let up. Then, in 
mid-January the Bush administration added plant and animal health 
reforms to the mix of changes they are demanding before implementation, 
pushing Central American countries to eliminate domestic health 
regulations for U.S. meat exports.

<p>"Clearly the Administration believes they have these countries backed in 
to a corner and is taking advantage of the situation to leverage even 
more benefits for U.S. corporations," said Andrew de Sousa of the 
Network in Solidarity with the People of Guatemala (NISGUA). "The costs 
for Central Americans will be very high, and thus people continue to 
resist"

<p>In El Salvador, the controversial legal reforms have already been 
approved by the Legislative Assembly, reviving the anti-CAFTA movement 
that had grown in strength since the agreement was introduced in 2002.

<p>"Any country negotiating with the Bush Administration right now should 
be wary of signing an agreement, given the example of consistently 
shifting the finish line for CAFTA in order to appease corporate 
supporters. There is no reason to believe they will not pull the same 
stunt with Peru, Panama, Colombia, or Ecuador," said Tom Ricker of the 
Quixote Center.

<p>On January 22 Presidents from the five Central American countries met to 
discuss CAFTA and also agreed to open a new regional facility for 
anti-terrorism and counter-narcotics monitoring in Guatemala. The 
facility would accompany a new US-sponsored police school (the 
International Law Enforcement Academy or ILEA) that is expected to open 
this year in El Salvador. Said Burke Stansbury of the Committee in 
Solidarity with the People of El Salvador (CISPES), "The rise in US 
military aid and influence to Central America is clearly essential to 
the strategy of expanding corporate trade, and these new military 
facilities demonstrate a move towards combating increased popular 
resistance with force."
