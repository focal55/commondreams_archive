<p>WASHINGTON  - November 13 - Senators Susan Collins (R-ME) and Russ Feingold 
          (D-WI) along with a number of their Senate Colleagues, have introduced 
          legislation to extend the term of the Special Inspector General for 
          Iraq Reconstruction (SIGIR). Without this legislation, the SIGIR&#8217;s 
          term would expire next year, on October 1, 2007. The Senators&#8217; legislation would enable the SIGIR to continue his critical oversight 
          work until late 2008.
<p> Specifically, the legislation, which the Senators will try to move 
          during the lame duck session of Congress, would reinstate the SIGIR&#8217;s 
          previous termination schedule of ten months after 80 percent of funds 
          for Iraq reconstruction have been expended. A recently enacted defense 
          spending bill includes a provision that would end the SIGIR&#8217;s 
          oversight responsibilities next year. The Senators believe that the 
          work of the SIGIR&#8217;s office, led by Stuart Bowen, is critical and 
          has effectively rooted out millions of dollars of waste, fraud, and 
          abuse, and therefore, must be continued.</p>
          
        <p> Senator Collins said, &#8220;There is no question that the Special 
          Inspector General's office has proven to be a much-needed watchdog, 
          auditing reconstruction contracts in Iraq and spotlighting numerous 
          cases of waste, fraud, and abuse. We must keep the watchdog on the job. 
          This office is responsible for providing the American taxpayer a benefit 
          of more than $25 for every dollar it has spent on oversight and investigations. 
          Its work has resulted in indictments and convictions of individuals 
          who ripped off the taxpayer. It is inconceivable that we would remove 
          this aggressive oversight while the American taxpayer is still spending 
          billions of dollars on Iraq reconstruction projects.&#8221;</p>
          
        <p> Senator Feingold said, &#8220;We're introducing this bill to prevent 
          the SIGIR from being prematurely shut down and to ensure that U.S. taxpayer 
          dollars for Iraq reconstruction efforts will not be vulnerable to even 
          more waste, fraud and abuse,&#8221; Feingold said. &#8220;Without this 
          commonsense, bipartisan legislation, Americans will not know where billions 
          of their taxpayer dollars are going in this costly war.&#8221;</p>
          
        <p> The SIGIR&#8217;s office is responsible for oversight of approximately 
          $32 billion in Iraq reconstruction contracts and grants. As a result 
          of his work, the SIGIR estimates that the financial impact of his audits, 
          investigations, and inspections, is approximately $1.87 billion, far 
          exceeding the offices expenses of $72 million.</p>
          
        <p>The SIGIR&#8217;s office has issued 73 audit reports and 65 project 
          assessments, and the office&#8217;s work has resulted in the arrest 
          of five people, and the convictions of four, with more than $17 million 
          in assets seized. </p>
          
        <p> Additional cosponsors of the bill include Senators Joseph Lieberman, 
          (D-CT), Patrick Leahy (D-VT), Robert Byrd (D-WV), Carl Levin (D-MI), 
          Joe Biden (D-DE), Maria Cantwell (D-WA), Norm Coleman (R-MN), John Kerry 
          (D-MA), Ken Salazar (D-CO), Tom Coburn (R-OK), John Sununu (R-NH), Edward 
          Kennedy (D-MA), Frank Lautenberg (D-NJ), Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), Byron 
          Dorgan (D-ND), and Ron Wyden (D-OR).</p>
