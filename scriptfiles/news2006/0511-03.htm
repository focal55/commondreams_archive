<p>   Background: A government crackdown in Ethiopia, following a  wave of political unrest, has left opposition politicians,  journalists, intellectuals and aid officials behind bars since  November 2005.   Among the 150 political prisoners detained is  Daniel Bekele, the policy manager for Action Aid International in  Ethiopia.  Bekele is also the Ethiopia representative of the  Global Call for Action Against Poverty (GCAP).  </p>
<p>   Two weeks ago, a high level delegation of African civil  society leaders went to Ethiopia to raise concerns about the  deteriorating human rights situation in Ethiopia and the fate of  political detainees.  </p>
<p>   Today, members of this delegation, alongside the daughter of  the president of Ethiopia, will meet with the newly-formed  Congressional Ethiopia Caucus to discuss the growing concerns  regarding human rights violations in Ethiopia, and to demand the  release of political prisoners.</p>
<p>   A closed discussion of top NGO leaders will follow tomorrow at  3 p.m. at the TransAfrica Forum.  Members of the media are  invited to attend.</p>
