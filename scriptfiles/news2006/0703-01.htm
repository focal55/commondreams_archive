WASHINGTON - July 1 - Congressman Dennis J. Kucinich (D-OH) issued the following statement today: 

<p>"On February 17, 2002, over four years ago, in Southern California, I gave a speech entitled, 'A Prayer for America.'  In that speech, I outlined my concern about the Bush Administration acting above the law, without regard for the Constitution and with virtually no oversight from Congress. Sadly, four and half years after I gave that speech all of what I said has come true. 


<p>"In yesterday's Supreme Court ruling on upholding the provisions of the Geneva Convention relative to prisoners at Guantanamo Bay, Justice Breyer wrote, 'Congress has not issued the executive a blank check'  


<p>"I have said from the beginning that his Administration has used 9/11 to act above the law and outside the Constitution. The so call 'War on Terror' has become a War of Errors" 


<p>"From Iraq to Afghanistan, from illegal domestic spying to snooping into people's banking records, from North Korea to Iran, from Gitmo to Abu Ghraib at every turn this Administration has failed the American people, made our nation less safe, and has operated with contempt for the Constitution, dismissing the most basic principles of our democracy. Finally the Supreme Court has taken a step towards reining in an Imperial President. 


<p>"Four and half years ago, the direction America was headed was plain to see and that's why I wrote 'A Prayer for America.' My call then was for guiding our nation in a new direction in which we faced the challenges of terrorism in a way that brings us peace, security and preserves our democracy.  I called then for an America that comes together for our greater aspirations, not one divided against itself.


<p>"Today my words still ring true. It is not to late to take a new direction."
