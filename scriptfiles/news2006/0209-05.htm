<p> TALLAHASSEE, Florida - February 9 - Last week, a  psychologically disturbed woman returned to the Southern  California U.S. postal facility where she had worked and killed  six former co-workers. </p>
<p>   Yesterday, members of the Florida House Judiciary Committee  tabled a bill that would mandate the businesses allow employees  to have loaded firearms in their cars on company property, saying  it &quot;needed more work,&quot; according to the Associated Press. </p>
<p>   &quot;Needs more work?&quot; said Dana Quist, President of the Florida  Million Mom March chapter.  &quot;What this bill needs is a stake in  its heart.&quot; </p>
<p>   The bill is HB 129.  The Florida Chamber of Commerce and other  business community leaders have announced opposition to the bill.
