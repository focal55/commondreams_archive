<p>WASHINGTON - May 25 - This Memorial Day  Weekend, Gold Star families whose loved ones died as a result of  the war in Iraq, who are members of Military Families Speak Out's  chapter Gold Star Families Speak Out, are available for  interview. </p>
<p>   President Bush said, in remarks at the National Restaurant  Association Convention in Chicago on May 22, &quot;...the hardest job of  the President is to meet with families of the fallen. And it's a  -- it's my duty. But almost to a person, they say, whatever you  do, Mr. President, complete the mission, lay the foundation of  peace so my child had not died in vain. And I give them that  assurance every time I meet with them.&quot;  In fact, many Gold Star  families say otherwise. </p>
<p>   &quot;It serves no purpose to have more and more servicemen and  women die in an unjust and unjustifiable war, and have more  families experience the unbearable and unending pain that my  family has experienced,&quot; explained Celeste Zappala, mother of  Sgt. Sherwood Baker, the first Pennsylvania National Guardsman to  die in combat since World War II. Sgt. Baker was killed in action  in Baghdad on April 26, 2004 while guarding the Iraq Survey Group  as they searched for non-existent weapons of mass destruction. </p>
<p>   Elaine Johnson, who met with President Bush following the  death of her son Darius Jennings on November 2, 2003 in Iraq and  challenged him on his war policy, stated, &quot;The best way to honor  the memory of Darius and all of our loved ones is to end this  war, bring our troops home now and take care of them when they  get here.&quot; </p>
<p>   AVAILABLE FOR INTERVIEW: </p>
<p>   Members of Military Families Speak Out's chapter Gold Star  Families Speak Out whose loved ones have died as a result of the  war in Iraq are available for interview over Memorial Day  Weekend. To schedule an interview, contact Katya Kruglak, 703- 304-5075, or Nancy Lessin, 617-320-5301. </p>
