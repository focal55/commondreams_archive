<p>WASHINGTON - February 9 - Appearing before the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and 
Transportation, the American Civil Liberties Union today urged Congress to end 
two fatally flawed, airline passenger pre-screening systems operated by the 
Transportation Security Administration (TSA): Secure Flight and the Registered 
Traveler program. Both programs make America less safe while violating 
travelers&#8217; civil liberties.</P>
<P>"Commercial data can tell you if a person might be a credit risk, but it 
cannot predict whether he or she will commit an act of terror at a future date," 
said Timothy D. Sparapani, an ACLU Legislative Counsel. "Basing our aviation 
security on this faulty premise is as unwise as relying on alchemy or astrology. 
Secure Flight and Registered Traveler have wasted nearly $200 million in public 
funds, countless human hours, and have undergone several name changes and 
repeated, unsuccessful reformulations of their underlying proposals. None of 
this changes the fact that TSA has misdirected its limited resources toward 
programs that not only make us less safer, but make us less free."</P>
<P>Sparapani appeared today before the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, 
and Transportation as that panel heard from the government and experts regarding 
the TSA&#8217;s aviation passenger pre-screening programs. Both Secure Flight and 
Registered Traveler are based on the dubious premise that information about 
someone&#8217;s past credit history can accurately predict whether they may commit a 
future act of aviation terrorism. Moreover, these programs assume that 
terrorists would book tickets and board flights using their own names or known 
aliases.</P>
<P>However, in 2003 alone, the Federal Trade Commission estimated that nearly 10 
million people, or 4.6 percent of the adult population, were victims of some 
form of identity theft. With such a faulty foundation, the ACLU argued, the 
structure of both programs is bound to fail. This programmatic weakness leads to 
what security experts dub "False Negatives," or an inability to detect actual 
terrorists.</P>
<P>Additionally, many innocent Americans have already been wrongly tagged on 
government maintained "no-fly" lists. Little information is available on how 
these lists are maintained, and the redress process is almost non-existent. If 
both Secure Flight and Registered Traveler are launched, there are also serious 
concerns that the government would be creating centralized databases that are 
filled with misinformation and potential targets for identity thieves.</P>
<P>Sparapani said that Congress must revoke TSA&#8217;s authority to proceed with both 
programs, and could instead empower the TSA to redirect those funds to buy new 
technologies that will effectively screen all luggage and cargo for weapons, 
including plastic explosives.</P>
<P>"Secure Flight and Registered Traveler pose unacceptable risks to security, 
civil liberties and privacy," added Sparapani. "Congress must reject these 
programs, as it has done in the past. Aviation security must rely on proven 
methods, and not ineffective programs that threaten our most private 
information."</P>
