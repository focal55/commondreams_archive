<p>DENVER, Colorado - APRIL 25 - Friends of the Earth International and 
local communities from Peru, Ghana and Indonesia demand that US-based 
mining giant Newmont stop poisoning the drinking water around its mining 
operations.

<p>Representatives from Peru and Ghana will bring this message to Newmont 
CEO Wayne Murdy during the company’s shareholder meeting today in 
Denver, Colorado (US).


<p>PERU<br>

In Choropampa in Peru 400 people were hospitalized after mercury, a 
toxic metal and mining by-product, was spilled in the environment near a 
Newmont gold mine in 2000. The company did not agree to local demands 
for an independent health impact study. At La Apalina, the company 
closed an irrigation channel that is crucial for the survival of local 
farmers. “Water is the source of life. To deprive poorest people of this 
right so that a few people can get rich, is one of the gravest sins that 
Newmont is committing in the Northern Andes of Peru,” says Father Marco 
Arana of the Peruvian organization Grufides.

<p>INDONESIA<br>

In Indonesia, the Ministry of Environment commissioned an investigation 
about pollution around a Newmont mine in the Buyat Bay area in 2004. 
Drinking water for the local community contained up to three times the 
legally allowed amount of mercury, a toxic metal and mining by-product, 
and the amount of arsenic, which is also toxic, exceeded legal norms. 
High concentrations of mercury and arsenic were detected in the Buyat 
Bay seabed. Health problems such as skin diseases, tumors and birth 
defects have become more and more frequent. In August 2004, 23 people 
were hospitalized and had to undergo surgery.

<p>GHANA<br>

Newmont’s operations in Ahafo, even at the construction stages, have 
impacted negatively on water availability in the area. “The construction 
of a dam on river Subri has deprived many communities of access to 
drinking water and for water-based livelihoods. The dam has left the 
river Subri almost dead and the disposal of fecal matter into river 
Asuopre has rendered it unsafe for use by communities.” says Daniel 
Owusu-Koranteng of the Wassa Association of Communities Affected by 
Mining (WACAM) in Ghana. The water situation of the communities is 
expected to worsen when Newmont starts its mining operations.


<p>Newmont refused to address many complaints by locals in the cases 
mentioned above but also in other countries. Demands for independent 
research were ignored and promises made at last year’s shareholder 
meeting have been broken. The company merely responds with Public 
Relations activities to explain how environmentally friendly its 
operations supposedly are.

<p>Friends of the Earth International, the Indigenous Support Network and 
the Fourth World Centre for Indigenous Law and Politics (both from the 
University of Colorado in Denver) have invited Mr. Daniel 
Owusu-Koranteng, from WACAM in Ghana, and Father Marco Arana, from 
Grufides in Peru, to Denver where they presented the impacts mining on 
indigenous people in their countries at the conference "The Real Price 
of Gold?" on April 24, 2006.

<p>On April 25, they will attend the Newmont shareholder meeting and meet 
Newmont officials. They will ask Newmont to stop poisoning drinking 
water and stress the need for independent research and monitoring of 
Newmont’s performance in guaranteeing water quality around its 
operations worldwide.

<p>‘These examples show that local communities around the world are not 
properly protected against companies like Newmont and their destructive 
mining activities. Local people are often negatively affected and most 
of the time they don’t want giant mining operations in the first place. 
Affected people need to get better rights to protect their environment 
and their health. If needed, they must be able to take a company like 
Newmont to court in the US for crimes committed in other parts of the 
world,” says Paul de Clerck from Friends of the Earth International

<p>A reduction of mining globally is needed to ensure a sustainable 
livelihood for local communities and a sustainable use of natural 
resources. Worst practices should be immediate halted, especially 
cyanide heap leach gold mining and submarine and riverine tailings 
disposal.
