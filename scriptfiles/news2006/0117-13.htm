<p>NEW YORK  - January 17 - Saying that the Bush administration&#8217;s illegal spying on Americans 
must end, the American Civil Liberties Union today filed a first-of-its-kind 
lawsuit against the National Security Agency seeking to stop a secret electronic 
surveillance program that has been in place since shortly after September 11, 
2001.&nbsp;
<P>&#8220;President Bush may believe he can authorize spying on Americans without judicial or Congressional approval, but this program is illegal and we intend to put a stop to it,&#8221; said ACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero. &#8220;The current surveillance of Americans is a chilling assertion of presidential power that has not been seen since the days of Richard Nixon.&#8221;</P>
<P>The lawsuit was filed on behalf of a group of prominent journalists, 
scholars, attorneys, and national nonprofit organizations (including the ACLU) 
who frequently communicate by phone and e-mail with people in the Middle 
East.&nbsp; Because of the nature of their calls and e-mails, they believe their 
communications are being intercepted by the NSA under the spying program.&nbsp; 
The program is disrupting their ability to talk with sources, locate witnesses, 
conduct scholarship, and engage in advocacy.&nbsp; The program, which was first 
disclosed by The New York Times on December 16, has sparked national and 
international furor and has been condemned by lawmakers across the political 
spectrum.&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR><BR>In addition to the ACLU, the plaintiffs in 
today&#8217;s case are:&nbsp; </P>
<P><STRONG><EM>Authors and journalists</EM></STRONG> James Bamford, Christopher Hitchens and Tara 
McKelvey</P>
<P><STRONG><EM>Afghanistan scholar</EM></STRONG> Barnett Rubin of New York University&#8217;s Center on 
International Cooperation and democracy scholar Larry Diamond, a fellow at the 
Hoover Institution </P>
<P><EM><STRONG>Nonprofit advocacy groups</STRONG></EM> NACDL, Greenpeace, and Council on American Islamic 
Relations, who joined the lawsuit on behalf of their staff and membership</P>
<P>"The prohibition against government eavesdropping on American citizens is 
well-established and crystal clear,&#8221; said ACLU Associate Legal Director Ann 
Beeson, who is lead counsel in <EM>ACLU v. NSA</EM>.&nbsp; &#8220;President Bush's claim that 
he is not bound by the law is simply astounding. Our democratic system depends 
on the rule of law, and not even the president can issue illegal orders that 
violate Constitutional principles.&#8221;</P>
<P>According to news reports, President Bush signed an order in 2002 allowing 
the NSA to monitor the telephone and e-mail communications of "hundreds, perhaps 
thousands, of people inside the United States" with persons abroad, without a 
court order as the law requires.&nbsp; Under the program, the NSA is also 
engaging in wholesale datamining by sifting through millions of calls and 
e-mails of ordinary Americans.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Journalist James Bamford, a plaintiff and one of the world&#8217;s leading experts 
on U.S. intelligence and the National Security Agency, said that &#8220;the spying 
program removes a necessary firewall that would prevent the kind of government 
abuse seen during the Watergate scandal.&#8221; Bamford was threatened with 
prosecution in the 1970s as he prepared to disclose unclassified details about 
illegal NSA spying on Americans in his book, The Puzzle Palace. </P>
<P>In the legal complaint filed, the ACLU said the spying program violates 
Americans&#8217; rights to free speech and privacy under the First and Fourth 
Amendments of the Constitution.&nbsp; </P>
<P>The ACLU also charged that the program violates the Constitution because 
President Bush exceeded his authority under separation of powers 
principles.&nbsp; Congress has enacted two statutes, the Foreign Intelligence 
Surveillance Act and Title III of the federal criminal code, which are &#8220;the 
exclusive means by which electronic surveillance. . . and the interception of 
domestic wire, oral, and electronic communications may be 
conducted.&#8221;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in the Eastern District of 
Michigan, seeks a court order declaring that the NSA spying is illegal and 
ordering its immediate and permanent halt.&nbsp; Attorneys in the case are 
Beeson, Jameel Jaffer, and Melissa Goodman of the national ACLU Foundation, and 
Michael Steinberg of the ACLU of Michigan.The lawsuit names as defendants 
the NSA and Lieutenant General Keith B. Alexander, the current the Director of 
the NSA.&nbsp; </P>

sheets on the case law and on the NSA spying program, and links to statements
