<p>WASHINGTON - September 14 - 
<p>MICHAEL RATNER, via Mahdis Keshavarz, <a href="mailto:mahdis@riptideonline.com">mahdis@riptideonline.com</a>, 
<a href="http://ccr-ny.org" target="_new">http://ccr-ny.org</a><br>
    Ratner is president of the Center for Constitutional Rights, which 
is holding a news conference in D.C. today with family members of 
Guantanamo detainees. He will discuss the two bills proposed by 
President Bush and Senator Warner to legislate military commissions.
<p>Ratner said today: "However problematic the [proposed military] 
commissions are, they are a distraction from the most dangerous 
provisions that would strip detainees of their right to challenge the 
legality of their detention. Attorneys for the detainees and other human 
rights observers and politicians have expressed grave concern that if 
either bill passes as currently written, it would prevent anyone taken 
into U.S. custody -- anywhere in the world, past, present or future, 
innocent or not -- from ever having their case heard in a court of law. 
This goes against every principle this country was founded on."
<p>The Center for Constitutional Rights is today releasing a report, 
"Faces of Guantanamo," which profiles men currently detained at Guantanamo.

<p>RAY McGOVERN, <a href="mailto:rrmcgovern@aol.com">rrmcgovern@aol.com</a><br>

    McGovern was a 27-year career analyst with the CIA and a member of 
the steering committee for Veteran Intelligence Professionals for 
Sanity. He said today: "The courts have held that many of Bush's 
policies are illegal. How does Congress respond to this? By being legal 
enablers and moving to draft legislation to make these policies legal -- 
though they would still, for now, be unconstitutional. The Specter bill 
gives the President carte blanche. It abolishes all limits on the 
president's power to eavesdrop on U.S. citizens, it embraces the most 
radical 'unitary executive' theories of executive power, and attempts to 
destroy the possibility of judicial review of the president's behavior."
<p>McGovern added: "The most prominent individual being moved to 
Guantanamo is Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, whom the 9/11 Commission report 
labels the 'mastermind of the 9/11 attacks.' The Commission report noted 
that his 'animus toward the United States stemmed not from his 
experiences there as a student, but rather from his violent disagreement 
with U.S. foreign policy favoring Israel.' We have to ask: did they hate 
us, or our policies?"
<p>McGovern spoke yesterday at Camp Democracy, a grassroots gathering 
at the National Mall, near the White House. Video of McGovern and other 
material is available
