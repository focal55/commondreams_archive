<p>GULFPORT, Mississippi - August 28 - International  humanitarian agency Oxfam America raised concern today that out  of the $3 billion allocated for rebuilding homes damaged by  Hurricane Katrina along Mississippi's Gulf Coast, fewer than 30  households saw any of that assistance this week when the first  round of checks went out. Oxfam America called on Mississippi  state officials to immediately change course and work with  community leaders to develop a comprehensive housing recovery  plan by the end of September that meets the needs of the region's  poorest residents.</p>
<p>   The $3 billion homeowner assistance plan is part of the  federal rebuilding program designed to address the massive  housing crisis now sweeping the Gulf Coast as a result of  Katrina. Mississippi waived many of the program requirements --  including rules that would have guaranteed low-income households  a fair share of the assistance -- so that homeowners could get  the aid faster.</p>
<p>   &quot;In a state where 60,000 homes suffered severe damage, only  around 30,000 households were eligible for the initial program,  and now less than three dozen checks have gone out,&quot; said Oxfam  America's Minor Sinclair, director of its U.S. regional programs.  &quot;Very few families will have made any progress by Katrina's first  anniversary. People are stranded in gutted-out houses,  overcrowded trailers, and slipping deeper into debt, with no real  help in sight.&quot;</p>
<p>   Even if distribution dramatically accelerates, people have  already waited a whole year. Further, tens of thousands of  homeowners and renters are not eligible -- and there is still no  plan to get them back into homes. At a town hall meeting  organized by Oxfam America and the National Association for the  Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) and attended by more than  450 people in Gulfport Saturday night, residents repeatedly  questioned government policies that ignored their dire living  conditions while sitting on a multi-billion dollar aid package. </p>
<p>   &quot;As early as December, community groups raised questions about  who would be eligible for the homeowner's assistance and six  months ago, Oxfam America raised that red flag in a report  examining the state recovery plans,&quot; said Sinclair. &quot;When the  governor's office asked for input, it got swamped with letters  from residents lodging their concerns. That fear has now become a  reality.&quot;</p>
<p>   A host of problems have contributed to the limited reach of  this first phase of the program, including mixed messages from  government agencies, confusion about who was eligible for funding  and cumbersome paperwork. But these hurdles are no excuse for  keeping tens of thousands of hurricane survivors in limbo.</p>
<p>   &quot;One year after Katrina, affordable housing has been  completely neglected. The state sacrificed equity for expediency,  and now Mississippi has neither,&quot; said Mississippi Center for  Justice's Reilly Morse, referencing numbers cited by a  Mississippi Development Authority (MDA) spokesperson in a Los  Angeles Times story. The spokesperson said about two dozen checks  have been sent to households on the eve of the one-year  anniversary. &quot;The MDA must accelerate phase two of assistance if  they want to deliver any help to people by Christmas.&quot;</p>
