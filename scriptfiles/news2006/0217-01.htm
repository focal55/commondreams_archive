<p>MINNEAPOLIS - February 17 - The Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy (IATP) announced today that starting in April, Alexandra Spieldoch will be its new Director of the Trade and Global Governance Program.
<p>“We are very lucky to have Alexandra direct our trade team,” said IATP President Mark Ritchie. “She brings a wealth of international experience, both in analyzing the impact of trade on sustainable development, and working within national and international networks to effect change.”
<p>Before coming to IATP, Alexandra co-directed the Gender, Trade and Development (GTD) Project at the Center of Concern in Washington, D.C. She also served as the Global Coordinator for the International Gender and Trade Network (IGTN) secretariat.
<p>“IATP is a leading voice in its advocacy for sustainable rural livelihoods, not only at the local and national level, but globally where international rules are being designed,” said Spieldoch. “I am excited to join the Trade and Global Governance team and to build on our efforts to re-shape U.S. farm policy and global trade rules toward a more sustainable, fair trade system.”
<p>Alexandra received an M.A. in International Policy from the Monterey Institute of International Studies. Her B.A. is from Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri with a major in English and French literature. She has studied at the University of Buenos Aires, Argentina and lived on and off in Normandy, France for almost two years.
<p>Alexandra will manage staff in IATP’s headquarters in Minneapolis, as well as the IATP’s Trade Information Project in Geneva. She will take over as director of the program from Sophia Murphy, who will continue to work for IATP in Australia as a Senior Trade Associate.
<p>“We are very excited to have Alexandra’s expertise and strategic thinking,” said Murphy. “Alexandra’s experience in reaching out to many different networks in different regions of the world will greatly strengthen IATP’s work as we continue our research and advocacy for fair and more sustainable trade.”

<p>The Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy works globally to promote resilient family farms, communities and ecosystems through research and education, science and technology, and advocacy.
