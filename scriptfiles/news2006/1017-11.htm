<p>WASHINGTON - October 17 -  The Gay & Lesbian Leadership Institute will hold its annual Leadership Conference in Houston, Texas, Nov. 16 to 19, the group said today. The meeting of openly gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender elected and appointed officials and community leaders will hear from top political professionals about the outcome of the 2006 elections and the outlook for the political season ahead. Gov. Howard Dean, chairman of the Democratic National Committee, is set to give the Friday keynote address, and Rep. Barney Frank (D-Mass.) will address the conference on Saturday.

<p>"This is a critical time for openly gay leaders. Mark Foley cannot become the face of gay elected officials," said Chuck Wolfe, president and CEO of the Leadership Institute. "LGBT leaders and others in politics will come together to share their ideas and strategies about emerging from an era where our lives are used as a political wedge issue."

<p>Other panelists and speakers include:

<p>-- Matt Foreman, National Gay and Lesbian Task Force

<p>-- Kate Kendall, National Center for Lesbian Rights

<p>-- H. Alexander Robinson, National Black Justice Coalition

<p>-- Volker Beck, Member of Parliament, Germany

<p>-- Pam Spaulding, Pam's House Blend Blog

<p>-- Jason Bellini, CBS News on Logo (moderator)

<p>-- Ari Shapiro, National Public Radio (moderator)

<p>-- Rosanna Flamer-Caldera, International Lesbian and Gay Association

<p>-- And numerous local and state elected and appointed officials

<p>The Leadership Institute will also hold its renowned Campaign & Candidate Training Nov. 15 to 18 in Houston. The training is an intense four-day workshop designed to prepare openly LGBT leaders and campaign workers to run a campaign. Dallas County Sherriff Lupe Valdez, a graduate of the training, said it "provided the guidance, skills and support I needed to run for a seat that no Democrat had won in more than 25 years -- and no woman had ever won."
