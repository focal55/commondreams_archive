<p>WASHINGTON - July 10 - In a letter sent today  to the House Ethics Committee, Democracy 21 President Fred  Wertheimer called for an investigation into whether Rep. John  Doolittle (R-Calif.) violated House ethics rules by intervening  in two case-specific matters pending at the Department of the  Interior in support of lobbyist Jack Abramoff's tribal clients  during the same period that a company owned by Rep. Doolittle's  wife received payments from Abramoff's law firm, which inured to  the personal financial benefit of Rep. Doolittle's family.</p>
<p>   The Democracy 21 letter specifically noted the close proximity  in time between the interventions at the Interior Department by  Rep. Doolittle, which benefited Abramoff's clients, and the  receipt by Rep. Doolittle's family of personal financial benefits  from Abramoff's law firm.</p>
<p>   The Democracy 21 letter also called on the Ethics Committee to  investigate whether the services provided by the company of Julie  Doolittle, Rep. Doolittle's wife, to Abramoff's law firm during the periods from August 2002 to January 2003, and from July 2003  to February 2004, were commensurate with the fees of some $67,000  paid by the law firm to Julie Doolittle's company during those  periods.</p>
<p>   Democracy 21 also today forwarded a copy of its House Ethics  Committee letter to the Public Integrity Section of the Justice  Department and called for an investigation of whether Doolittle's  activities may have violated criminal statues.</p>
<p>   Today's letter to the House Ethics Committee followed a  previous letter sent by Democracy 21 to the Ethics Committee on  June 23 that called for an investigation into other activities  engaged in by Rep. Doolittle. These matters included:</p>
<p>   Whether Rep. Doolittle violated House ethics rules, including  the rules that prohibit a House member from converting any  campaign funds under the member's control to personal use,  through his arrangement with his wife's company whereby  Doolittle's campaign committee and his leadership PAC paid more  than $200,000 in percentage-based commission fees to his wife's  company for fundraising services; and</p>
<p>   Whether Rep. Doolittle's official actions to help provide  businessman Brent Wilkes' company with $37 million in &quot;earmarked&quot;  federal funds were undertaken in connection with, or created the  appearance that they were undertaken in connection with,  contributions made by Wilkes and his associates to Doolittle's  campaign committee and leadership PAC, resulting in fundraising  fees paid to his wife's company, in violation of House ethics  rules.</p>
<p>   &quot;As set forth in our letters, the Doolittle case provides  another clear test of whether the House Ethics Committee is going  to take seriously its responsibilities to ensure that House  Members comply with House ethics rules,&quot; Wertheimer stated.</p>
<p>   &quot;The Doolittle case also raises the important issue of whether  the House Ethics Committee is going to allow Members to convert  campaign funds from their campaign committees and leadership PACs  to personal use, in violation of specific prohibitions in the  House ethics rules, and thereby provide a license for wholesale  abuse of these rules by House members,&quot; Wertheimer stated.</p>
<p>   Copies of the letters sent today to the House Ethics Committee  and the Justice Department and a copy of the June 23 letter to  the House Ethics Committee are available at  <a href="http://releases.usnewswire.com/redir.asp?ReleaseID=68955&Link=http://www.democracy21.org">http://www.democracy21.org</a>.
