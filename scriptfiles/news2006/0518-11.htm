<p>WASHINGTON - May 18 - <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Reports 
        of plans by the National Rifle Association (NRA) to launch a nationwide 
        campaign today targeting Mayors and Police Chiefs to pledge to never confiscate 
        firearms in the wake of a natural disaster or terrorist attack will only 
        validate the extremist views of the anti-law enforcement fringe of the 
        pro-gun movement, the Violence Policy Center (VPC) warned today. </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The VPC warned that 
        the NRA was returning to the fear tactics it had embraced in the early 
        1990s during the Clinton Administration, when the organization adopted 
        the language of the anti-government militia movement, warning that "The 
        Final War Has Begun," calling federal agents <a href="../jackboot.htm">"jack 
        booted government thugs"</a> and "storm troopers," and comparing the FBI 
        to goose-stepping Nazis. The NRA abandoned the campaign after former NRA 
        member Timothy McVeigh blew up the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in 
        Oklahoma City in April 1995, killing 168 people. </font> 
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">VPC Executive Director 
        Josh Sugarmann states, "The NRA is expert at exploiting high-profile events 
        involving alleged infringement of their perceived `freedoms' as red meat 
        to motivate the pro-gun hard core. To raise money and retain the support 
        of this faction of activist gun owners, the NRA is willing once again 
        to place America's law enforcement and public officials at risk." In a 
        November 2005 interview with <i>National Journal</i>, NRA Executive Vice 
        President Wayne LaPierre said of the organization's focus on police actions 
        during Hurricane Katrina: "This will probably mint money for us." </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Written attacks on 
        law enforcement are common on pro-gun web sites and discussion forums. 
        A web site—<a href="http://www.keepandbeararms.com">www.keepandbeararms.com</a>—owned 
        by the Second Amendment Foundation, which filed a suit against the City 
        of New Orleans with the NRA challenging gun confiscations during Katrina, 
        regularly has posted comments attacking law enforcement. The web site 
        has a section titled "The Authorities" which features alleged government 
        intrusions on gun ownership and police misconduct. Posts on the site that 
        appeared following Hurricane Katrina and reports of weapon confiscations 
        included: </font>
<ul>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> "I do not care 
          who you are, or what authority you claim to possess. If you attempt 
          to disarm me, I will kill you. It is becoming increasingly clear that 
          the government will use any tragedy or excuse to violate our rights 
          and further expand their totalitarian regime....When the government 
          begins to violate the rights of citizens under the auspices of keeping 
          order, hunt down and kill all who follow such illegal orders. Only in 
          this way will liberty prevail." <br>
          <br>
          </font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> "It was obvious 
          that the lawyer in question [who said that he would not give up his 
          guns, but later did] was talk talk talk, and not shoot shoot shoot." 
          <br>
          <br>
          </font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> "Twenty JBT's 
          [jack-booted thugs] outside your house may be bullet proof but they're 
          not fire proof." <br>
          <br>
          </font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"I hear that some 
          JBTs [jack-booted thugs] enjoy cocktails after work. One cocktail they 
          wouldn't enjoy would be a molotov cocktail." <br>
          <br>
          </font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The question is 
          simple: would you give the cops a piece of crap gun to send them on 
          their way. Or would you be willing to ambush the cops at your door and 
          then have to leave your home and family to go on the run. Would you 
          be willing to stay and fight and be killed. Or do you have people on 
          your street that would be willing to fight and put the cops in a cross 
          fire keeping them out of the area. The big question would you be ready 
          to die in a gun battle." <br>
          <br>
          </font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"From my upstairs 
          window, I can cover the front yards of three neighbors. I make head 
          shots at that range freehand all the time. With .223 fmj [full-metal 
          jacket] and up, vest penetration shouldn't be a problem, either." <br>
          <br>
          </font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"I have read several 
          accounts, that if it were me, there would have been gun play. I don't 
          say that lightly, however, I would not willingly be illegally disarmed 
          and/or have my dogs shot. I may go down, but I guarantee that I would 
          take more than one of the bastards with me. It is not too much of a 
          stretch with superior weapons to take down a few rogue police. I would 
          seriously try and avoid a confrontation with the military. For one thing, 
          they do not have an agenda, and for another they will have superior 
          firepower and numbers." <br>
          <br>
          </font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"I will let the 
          government (city, state, or federal) take my firearms one round at a 
          time, after a good sight picture and trigger squeeze. Give me liberty 
          or give me DEATH!!! </font></li>
</ul>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Adds Sugarmann, "The 
        NRA calls this week's convention a meeting of ‘Freedom's 2nd Army.' It 
        is now clear who this army's enemy is: law enforcement and public officials."</font>
