<p>NEW YORK - September 13 - Citizens for  Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) announced today  that it is adding former Deputy Secretary of State Richard L.  Armitage to the lawsuit filed by Valerie Plame Wilson and Joseph  C. Wilson against I. Lewis &quot;Scooter&quot; Libby, Karl Rove and Vice  President Richard Cheney. CREW represents the Wilsons in the  litigation.</p>
<p>   A new book by Michael Isikoff and David Corn, 'Hubris: The  Inside Story of Spin, Scandal and the Selling of the Iraq War',  discloses that Armitage was the first administration official to  reveal that Valerie Wilson worked for the CIA. Armitage told this  information to reporters Bob Woodward and Robert Novak. Armitage  has since confirmed his role and has admitted that he learned  that Ms. Wilson worked for the CIA from classified documents.  Novak has also confirmed Armitage as his initial source.</p>
<p>   As a result of Armitage's disclosures of this information and  the resulting publication of Mrs. Wilson's CIA employment, Mr.  and Mrs. Wilson suffered gross invasions of their privacy and  Mrs. Wilson lost the ability to continue working as a covert CIA  officer.  Armitage is being sued for violating the Wilsons'  constitutional right to privacy, Mrs. Wilson's constitutional  right to property, and for committing the tort of publication of  private facts.</p>
<p>   CREW's executive director Melanie Sloan said today, &quot;The  addition of Armitage as a defendant in no way reduces the  culpability of the three original defendants. Separate and apart  from Armitage's actions, Libby, Rove and Cheney engaged in an  intentional and malicious conspiracy to expose Mrs. Wilson's  identity as a covert operative for the CIA in order to punish Mr.  Wilson for his public statements about the President's  justifications for the war against Iraq.&quot;  Sloan continued, &quot;this  case was and remains about one issue -– the abuse of government  power.&quot;</p>
