<p>WASHINGTON - August 11 - The American Civil Liberties Union and the National Abortion 
Federation (NAF) today submitted a friend-of-the-court brief in the U.S. Supreme 
Court calling on the Court to protect women&#8217;s health when it hears argument next 
term in a challenge to the Federal Abortion Ban. Both groups urged the Supreme 
Court to affirm lower court decisions striking down the ban. </P>
<P>&#8220;The Federal Abortion Ban prohibits abortions as early as 13 weeks in 
pregnancy that doctors say are safe and among the best to protect women&#8217;s 
health,&#8221; said Vicki Saporta, NAF President and CEO. &#8220;We hope that the Supreme 
Court will recognize the danger this ban poses to women&#8217;s health and allow 
doctors to continue to make appropriate medical decisions.&#8221; </P>
<P>The Supreme Court is set to review two challenges to the Federal Abortion Ban 
- called the Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act by its sponsors - during the 
2006-2007 term: <EM>Gonzales v. Carhart</EM>, brought by the Center for Reproductive 
Rights on behalf of Dr. LeRoy Carhart and three other physicians and decided by 
the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit in July 2005, and <EM>Gonzales v. 
Planned Parenthood Federation of America</EM>, brought by Planned Parenthood 
Federation of America on behalf of its affiliates throughout the country and 
decided by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in October 2005. Both 
circuit courts held the ban unconstitutional. </P>
<P>A third challenge to the Federal Abortion Ban, <EM>NAF v. Gonzales</EM>, was brought 
by NAF and seven individual physicians, represented by the ACLU, Wilmer Cutler 
Pickering Hale and Dorr LLP, the ACLU of Illinois, and the New York Civil 
Liberties Union. In January 2006, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second 
Circuit affirmed that the ban requires a health exception and asked for further 
legal briefing to determine how to remedy the violation. That case is now on 
hold as the other two cases go to the Supreme Court. </P>
<P>&#8220;Decisions involving pregnancy and medical care are among the most serious a 
woman will make in her life,&#8221; said Talcott Camp, Deputy Director of the ACLU 
Reproductive Freedom Project. &#8220;These are personal decisions for a woman, her 
family, and her doctor to make and such decisions should not be mandated by 
politicians.&#8221; </P>
<P>Medical groups, including the American College of Obstetricians and 
Gynecologists, oppose the federal ban. </P>
<P>Congress passed the federal ban and President Bush signed it into law in 
2003, despite the numerous court decisions striking down similar state bans, 
including a decision in 2000 by the Supreme Court in Stenberg v. Carhart. Courts 
have consistently struck down the bans for two reasons: their broad language 
prohibits abortions as early as 13 weeks in pregnancy, and they lack exceptions 
to protect women&#8217;s health. </P>
<P>NAF is the professional association of abortion providers in the United 
States and Canada. NAF members care for more than half the women who choose 
abortion each year in the United States and work at clinics, doctors' offices, 
and hospitals throughout the country, including premier teaching hospitals. </P>
<P>The ACLU is our nation's guardian of liberty, working daily in courts, 
legislatures and communities to defend and preserve the individual rights and 
liberties guaranteed to every person in this country by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States. </P>
