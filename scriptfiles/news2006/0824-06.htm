<p>WASHINGTON - August 24 - On Wednesday, Aug. 30, at noon ET, the AFL-CIO will hold a Labor Day press briefing to detail its $40 million member mobilization campaign in the most important mid-term election in generations for working families.  Major advances in the AFL-CIO's political program -- including increases in the number of voters it turns out in many competitive races and new targeting and turnout techniques --will make its role especially important, and possibly decisive, in the outcome of this November's elections.
<p>   The 2006 mid-term mobilization is the largest in the AFL-CIO's history, engaging more than 12.4 million voters in 21 top tier states.  The AFL-CIO is actively engaged in 21 governor's races, 15 Senate races and more than 50 House races. </p>
<p>   At Wednesday's press briefing, new polling and other information will be presented on workers' issues.  AFL-CIO President John Sweeney will also outline union movement advances and plans to make America work for working people on issues such as the minimum wage, health care, retirement security and the freedom to form unions.</p>
<p>   Tele-conference will be available for those reporters unable to attend in person      </p>
<p>WHO:</p>
<p>   -- John J. Sweeney, AFL-CIO President </p>
<p>   -- Karen Ackerman, AFL-CIO Political Director </p>
<p>   -- Guy Molyneux, Peter D. Hart Research Associates Inc.                       </p>
