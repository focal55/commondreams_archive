<p>PITTSBURGH - March 14 - The American Civil Liberties Union and the ACLU of Pennsylvania 
today released new evidence that the Federal Bureau of Investigation is 
conducting investigations into a political organizations based solely on its 
anti-war views. </P>
<P>Two documents released today reveal that the FBI investigated gatherings of 
the Thomas Merton Center for Peace &amp; Justice just because the organization 
opposed the war in Iraq.&nbsp; Although previously disclosed documents show that 
the FBI is retaining files on anti-war groups, these documents are the first to 
show conclusively that the rationale for FBI targeting is the group's opposition 
to the war.</P>
<P>&#8220;It makes no sense that the FBI would be spying on peace activists handing 
out flyers,&#8221; said Jim Kleissler, Executive Director of the Thomas Merton Center 
for Peace &amp; Justice.&nbsp; &#8220;Our members were simply offering leaflets to 
passersby, legally and peacefully, and now they&#8217;re being investigated by a 
counter&#8211;terrorism unit.&nbsp; Something is seriously wrong in how our government 
determines who and what constitutes terrorism when peace activists find 
themselves targeted.&#8221; </P>
<P>According to the documents released today, the FBI initiated a classified 
investigation into the activities of the Thomas Merton Center, noting in a 
November 2002 memo that the center &#8220;holds daily leaflet distribution activities 
in downtown Pittsburgh and is currently focused on its opposition to the 
potential war on Iraq.&#8221;&nbsp; The synopsis of the document is provided to 
&#8220;report results of investigation on Pittsburgh anti-war activities.&#8221;&nbsp; The 
FBI memo points out that the Merton Center &#8220;is a left-wing organization 
advocating, among many political causes, pacifism.&#8221;&nbsp; </P>
<P>&#8220;All over the country we see the FBI monitoring and keeping files on 
Americans exercising their First Amendment rights to free expression,&#8221; said Mary 
Catherine Roper, a staff attorney with the ACLU of Pennsylvania.&nbsp; &#8220;These 
documents show that Americans are not safe from secret government surveillance, 
even when they are handing out flyers in the town square &#8211; an activity clearly 
protected by the Constitution.&#8221;</P>
<P>The documents come to the ACLU as a result of a national campaign to expose 
domestic spying by the FBI and other government agencies.&nbsp; The ACLU has 
filed Freedom of Information Act requests in 20 states on behalf of more than 
150 organizations and individuals.&nbsp; In response to these requests, the 
government has released documents that reveal monitoring and infiltration by the 
FBI and local law enforcement, targeting political, environmental, anti-war and 
faith-based groups.&nbsp; </P>
<P>&#8220;From the FBI to the Pentagon to the National Security Agency this 
administration has embarked on an unprecedented campaign to spy on innocent 
Americans,&#8221; said Ann Beeson, Associate Legal Director of the national 
ACLU.&nbsp; &#8220;Investigating law-abiding groups and their members simply because 
of their political views is not only irresponsible, it has a chilling effect on 
the vibrant tradition of dissent in this country.&#8221; </P>

released today as well as profiles of members of the Thomas Merton Center is
