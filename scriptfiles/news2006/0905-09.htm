<p>AMSTERDAM - September 5 - 
      Greenpeace International released findings today that show illegal genetically engineered (GE) rice from China has contaminated food products in France, Germany and the UK. Greenpeace International has notified authorities that the illegal GE rice poses serious health risks and calls upon European governments to take immediate action to protect consumers.<br>
<br>
Greenpeace offices and Friends of the Earth in the UK tested samples of
rice products such as vermicelli, rice sticks and other processed
foods. Five positive samples were found containing an illegal GE not
approved anywhere in the world. However this could be the tip of the
iceberg with rice products included in everything from baby food to
yoghurt. (1) <br>
<br>
"These findings are shocking and should trigger high-level responses",
said Jeremy Tager, GE rice campaigner, Greenpeace International.
"Consumers should not be left swallowing experimental GE rice that is
risky to their health."<br>
<br>
The illegal GE rice, genetically engineered to be resistant to insects,
contains a protein or fused protein (Cry1Ac) that has reportedly
induced allergic-like reactions in mice (2). Three independent
scientists with expertise in the field of GE and health have issued a
statement backing the health concerns raised by Greenpeace
International. (3) <br>
<br>
Greenpeace International is calling for immediate worldwide recall,
measures to ensure no further contaminated rice enters the EU and the
urgent implementation of a preventative screening system for countries
with high contamination risks. Demanding GE free certification for food
from countries that grow and produce GE crops is reasonable, cost
effective, and necessary to protect Europe's consumers.<br>
<br>
This recent rice contamination in China began with field trials; the
rice is not currently approved for commercial growing because of
mounting concerns over its safety. Yet an investigation by Greenpeace
in 2005 showed that research institutes and seed companies in China had
been illegally selling unapproved GE rice seeds to farmers. (4)<br>
<br>
"Innocent consumers again become the victims of the GE industry's
'contamination first' strategy", says Tager.&nbsp; "A group of rogue
scientists pushing for the approval of GE rice in China, leaked the
illegal seeds to the market and have created major genetic
contamination", said Tager. Just two weeks ago, the US commercial rice
supply was contaminated with an illegal GE rice developed by Bayer. The
contamination is believed to be rife - despite the fact that the rice
never moved beyond open field trials.&nbsp; Already two ships have been
detained and the EU and Japan have imposed testing and certification
requirements on US rice.&nbsp; "Once illegal GE crops are in the food
chain, removing them takes enormous effort and cost. It is easier to
prevent contamination in the first place," concluded Tager.<br>
<br>
Greenpeace campaigns for GE-free crop and food production that is
grounded in the principles of sustainability, protection of
biodiversity and providing all people to have access to safe and
nutritious food. Genetic engineering is an unnecessary and unwanted
technology that contaminates the environment, threatens biodiversity
and poses unacceptable risks to health.<br> </p> <p><b>Notes to Editor</b></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0px;">(4) Further testing indicated that the whole food chain had been contaminated, with the most recent case being the contaminated Heinz rice cereal products in Beijing, Guangzhou and Hongkong. The Chinese government, in the wake of the situation, reportedly punished seed companies and destroyed illegally grown GE rice.</p>
