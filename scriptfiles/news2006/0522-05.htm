<p>WASHINGTON - May 22 - <p>   News Advisory:</p>
<p>   The Center for International Policy, with the participation of  the Latin American Working Group, the Washington Office on Latin  America, Church World Service and the National Council of the  Churches of Christ, invites media to a press conference to discuss  the counterproductive nature of the Commission for Assistance to  a Free Cuba, which is based on the assumption that the Castro  regime is on its last legs and that the U.S. will play a role in  overseeing Cuba's transition to democracy in the post-Castro  period. </p>
<p>   The Commission will shortly be coming forward with new  recommendations, which are likely to be as unrealistic as the  earlier ones, adopted by President Bush in May 2004. Instead of  positing helpful exchanges, the previous recommendations  accomplished only the severe limitation of travel by Cuban- Americans, thus causing further suffering to Cuban families; the  cut back on travel in general, including the travel of religious  groups to and from Cuba; and the virtual elimination of academic  exchanges. Yet, in earlier cases (say, in the Soviet Union and  Eastern Europe), the U.S. had felt that such people-to-people  contacts were an important means of communicating the message of  American democracy. It is especially difficult to understand why  contacts with religious groups have been restricted. </p>

<p>   Meanwhile, while the U.S. is working unilaterally to isolate  the island, Cuba has new economic partners in Venezuela and China  and possibly a large new oil field off its north coast. Cuba is  far from isolated and there are no indications that the Cuban  economy is on the verge of collapse.   </p>
<p>   WHEN: May 25, 9 a.m. through 11 a.m.</p>
