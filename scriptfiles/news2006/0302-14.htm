<p>WASHINGTON - March 2 - Congressman Dennis J. Kucinich (D-OH) gave the following speech today on the House Floor: 

<p>"I would like to call to the attention of the House the juxtaposition of two news stories: 

<p>"One, relating to 9/11, that states, the federal officials were repeatedly warned in the months before the September 11th, 2001 terror attack that Osama bin Laden and Al-Qeada were planning to hijack planes and use them for suicide missions accord to a new report that the Bush Administration has been suppressing. 

<p>"And this, from the front page of today's Washington Post, a newly leaked video recorded of a high level government deliberation the day before Hurricane Katrina hit shows disaster officials emphatically warning President Bush that the storm posed a catastrophic threat to New Orleans and the Gulf Coast and a grim faced Bush personally assuring state leaders that his Administration was fully prepared to help. 

<p>"Do we see a pattern here? September 11th and Katrina--they knew something was going to happen and they did not act. They knew that if we invaded Iraq that we looking at a disaster. They know that global climate change poses a threat to the entire planet and they have not acted. 

<p>"A pattern of recklessness, indifference, and callousness, the implications of which have been deadly."
