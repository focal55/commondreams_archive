<p>WASHINGTON - February 2 - "Even when pressed by the demands of inner truth, men do not easily assume the tasks of opposing their government's policy, especially in a time of war. But there comes a time 
when silence is betrayal." 
--- The Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. 




<p>We, members of the undersigned organizations, seek a progressive Democrat to run for U.S. Senate against incumbent Senator Dianne Feinstein in the California Democratic primary on June 6, 2006. 

<p>We aspire to build enduring world peace through the world rule of law. We oppose unilateral and pre-emptive war -- illegal under both the UN Charter and US Constitution -- and know that it diminishes rather than protects our true national security. We believe that we are both citizens of the United States and citizens of the world, and that our national patriotism must be transcended by a larger and nobler planetary patriotism. 

<p>We seek to reverse growing economic inequality, both around the block and around the world. We maintain that health care ought to be not a commercial commodity, but a fundamental right -- and that publicly funded universal health care is the way to bring that about. We find few things more irresponsible than burdening the taxpayers of the future with the debts of the present -- debts caused primarily by a bloated military establishment, needless tax cuts for the rich, and policies of perpetual war. We disagree with Ronald Reagan's assertion that "government is not the solution to our problems," and believe that government exists to proactively improve the human condition. 

<p>We fiercely defend our freedom of speech, our freedom of conscience, and our freedom to talk with one other without our government listening in. We do not confuse dissent with disloyalty. We insist that challenging our political leaders is not only not "reckless" -- as the president and vice president have repeatedly claimed -- but is instead the soul of patriotism. 

<p>In its November 28th edition, THE NATION magazine proclaimed that it "will not support any candidate for national office who does not make a speedy end to the American war in Iraq a major issue." The firebrand labor activist Jonathan Tasini is challenging New York Senator Hillary Clinton in the Democratic primary there -- motivated largely by her timidity on the war. The businessman Ned Lamont is challenging Connecticut Senator Joe Lieberman in the Democratic primary there -- motivated largely by his unwavering support for the war. And here in California, a grass roots rebellion against a Democratic Party establishment that has failed to lead has both moved Congresswoman Jane Harman's position on the war and led directly to House minority leader Nancy Pelosi's embrace of Congressman Jack Murtha's trenchant call for a rapid "redeployment" out of Iraq. 

<p>All of us support these kinds of progressive initiatives. None of us feel we can do any less. 

<p>Senator Feinstein rarely articulates anything like the bedrock progressive values we claim for ourselves above. She is a corporate Democrat, an establishment Democrat, a politics-as-usual Democrat. She has voted repeatedly for the Bush tax cuts, which overwhelmingly benefit those few Americans in her own tax bracket. She voted for CAFTA, which sacrifices the interests of workers on the altar of capital mobility. She helped lead the charge on banking deregulation in the 1990s, leading to financial disaster for many working Californians. She voted for the 2003 Medicare drug legislation, which provides huge windfalls for drug companies but does little more than confuse our senior citizens. She voted for the Patriot Act, one of the biggest threats to our civil liberties since the dawn of the republic. She consistently fails to challenge seemingly limitless U.S. military expenditures -- larger now than the military budgets of all other nations combined. She has never acknowledged the hypocrisy behind our nuclear double standard. Her husband's business enterprises have secured hundreds of millions of dollars in defense contracts for her family. And in one of the most invidious political remarks in recent memory, she blamed Gavin Newsom's courageous stand on gay marriage for the re-election of George Bush. 

<p>Most importantly for us at this critical juncture in American history, she voted for the Iraq war -- a towering fiasco generating a bottomless well of resentment that will haunt us for decades to come. And in the face of the mushrooming movement to bring a swift and just end to that fiasco, her silence has been deafening. 

<p>A number of Democratic officeholders here in California, past and present, have shown themselves to be the kind of progressive leaders we'd like to see represent us in the U.S. Senate. These include Jackie Goldberg, Tom Hayden, Paul Koretz, Sheila Kuehl, Barbara Lee, Gavin Newsom, Hilda Solis, Maxine Waters, and Lynn Woolsey. A number of authors and activists who have toiled in the vineyards of justice and peace also spring to mind. These include Ed Asner, Warren Beatty, George Clooney, Mike Farrell, Robert Greenwald, Dolores Huerta, Arianna Huffington, Mimi Kennedy, Rob Reiner, Tim Robbins, Susan Sarandon, and Martin Sheen. And a bid by Cindy Sheehan, the brave mother of a brave son lost forever to the dogs of war, would immediately generate enormous attention nationwide.

<p>We reject the notion that challenging a Democratic incumbent is somehow a treacherous act for a Democrat. Most of our Democratic members will undoubtedly support Senator Feinstein in the November 2006 general election if she wins the June 2006 primary. But this U.S. Senate seat comes before us only once every six years. The winner will hold it until 2013. The turnover rate for incumbents in Congress has come to resemble that in the old Soviet Politburo. And an election campaign is one of the few vehicles in any democracy for a vigorous policy debate. For Senator Dianne Feinstein, this is likely our last democratic moment. 

<p>We hope our initiative will push Senator Feinstein toward more progressive positions if she does in fact win another term. We hope it will force her -- and the party establishment -- to stop taking us for granted. We hope it will help to intensify the growing national antiwar movement. And we hope it will send a resounding message across our great land that California can offer a shining vision of the America we can become. 

<p>And who knows? An insurgent candidate might even win! And California might then find itself represented for many years to come by another Paul Wellstone, or another Teddy Kennedy, or even another "Fighting Bob" LaFollette -- who fought so fearlessly against both the First World War and the great assaults on our civil liberties that accompanied it. Such potential giants might well be waiting in the wings today. But we'll never know unless they step forward. 

<p>In 1968 the liberal advocacy group Americans for Democratic Action, led by Allard Lowenstein, doggedly sought a peace candidate to enter the Democratic primary race against President Lyndon Johnson. Those efforts led directly to the presidential candidacies of Eugene McCarthy and Bobby Kennedy. Neither man obtained the office he sought. But their campaigns, along with the exertions of millions of extraordinary citizens, led directly to the end of an unwise and unjust war. 

<p>Four long decades later, we crave a similar unfolding of history. Who will answer our call?
