<p>DAVID MacMICHAEL, <a href="mailto:dmacm@adelphia.net">dmacm@adelphia.net</a>, 
<a href="http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=David_MacMichael%20" target="_new">http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=David_MacMichael
</a>
<p>A disabled veteran of 10 years active Marine Corps service in 
Korea, MacMichael was a Defense Department consultant from 1965 to 
1969 in Southeast Asia. During most of that period he was attached to 
the office of the Special Assistant for Counter-Insurgency at the 
U.S. Embassy in Bangkok. In that capacity he reviewed classified 
reports from the U.S. mission in Vietnam.
<p>MacMichael said today: "The recent events revealed at Haditha in 
Iraq are, far from being an aberration, firmly within the tradition 
of American military operations. That the Haditha massacre involved 
U.S. Marines saddened this former Marine officer who more than 50 
years ago commanded a company of the Third Marines, the same regiment 
involved in this episode. However, it did not particularly surprise him."

<p>AARON GLANTZ, <a href="mailto:aaronfglantz@yahoo.com">aaronfglantz@yahoo.com</a>, <a href="http://www.aaronglantz.com%20" target="_new">http://www.aaronglantz.com
</a>
<p> Glantz is author of the book "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000BOB2NE/commondreams-20?creative=327641&camp=14573&adid=1303EGYHVSQE60EQ7K58&link_code=as1" target="_new">How America Lost Iraq</a>" and 
co-author of the recent articles "Multiply Haditha By Thousands" and 
"Basra Explodes." His recent articles are co-written with Alla 
Hassan, who is in Iraq.
<p> Glantz said today: "Such incidents are all too common in 
U.S.-occupied Iraq. I've reported on similar episodes during my time 
as an unembedded journalist there. Like many Iraqis I am upset but 
not surprised by recent reports."
<p>Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki recently stated: "The crime 
and misery of Haditha is a terrible crime where women and children 
were eliminated." Adding that violence against civilians is "common 
among many of the multinational forces," the new Iraqi prime minister 
stated many U.S. troops had "no respect for citizens, smashing 
civilian cars and killing on a suspicion or a hunch."
