<p>WASHINGTON - April 12 - Toxic releases to U.S. waterways increased by 10% between 2003 and 2004, pollution, according to U.S. PIRG’s analysis of Toxics Release Inventory data released today. In total, U.S. facilities released more than 4.25 billion pounds of toxic chemicals to air, water, and land in 2004, an overall decrease from 2003.   

 

<p>“The good news is that overall decreases show that the TRI program works,” said U.S. PIRG Environmental Health Advocate Meghan Purvis.  “But the increase in toxic water pollution shows that, now more than ever, Congress must act to pass the Clean Water Authority Restoration Act, and protect all U.S. waterways.”

 

<p>U.S. PIRG examined the TRI data for increases or decreases in pollution from 2003 to 2004.  For example, pollution in Maine increased 13.1% between 2003 and 2004, and pollution in Arizona increased 17.6%.  The largest increase at the state level was 43% in Washington state.  The table at the end of this release shows changes from 2003 to 2004 for each state.

 

<p>“Unfortunately, this may be one of the last years when the public gets a complete picture of toxic pollution,” said Purvis.  “If EPA’s proposal to gut the program moves forward, the public won’t receive this kind of detailed local information in the future.”

 

<p>EPA Administrator Stephen Johnson proposed changes to the Toxics Release Inventory Program (TRI) in October 2005 that will significantly decrease the information that the public and state and local officials have about harmful chemicals released into water, air, and land.  These changes to the Toxics Release Inventory (TRI) would be three-fold:

<p>
<ul>
<li>A rule to propose that companies be allowed to release ten times as much pollution before they are required to report their releases;</li>
<li> A rule that would allow companies to withhold information about some of the most dangerous chemicals, such as lead and mercury;</li>
<li>A notification to Congress that Administrator Johnson intends to release a rule next fall to change the frequency of reporting to the program from every year to every other year.</li>
</ul>
<p>EPA received more than 100,000 public comments on its proposed rule, and initial analysis shows that the vast majority oppose the changes.

 

<p>The TRI program is a pollution disclosure program.  Since 1987, companies have been required to report toxic releases to air, land, and water, as well as toxic waste that is treated, burned, recycled, or disposed of.  Approximately 26,000 industrial facilities report information about any of the 650 chemicals in the program.

 

<p>The Toxics Release Inventory has been credited with a wide range of successes.  Since the TRI program began, disposals or releases of the original 299 chemicals tracked have dropped 57% percent.  A U.S. PIRG Education Fund analysis showed that releases of chemicals linked to health effects have decreased as well.  Between 1995 and 2000, releases to air and water of chemicals known to cause cancer declined by 41 percent.

 

<p>More than 230 organizations, including environmental groups, public health groups, religious organizations, investment groups, and professors have opposed these changes.  In addition, twelve Attorneys General, state legislators and state regulators from across the country have weighed in to oppose these changes.

 

<p>“U.S. PIRG calls on Congressional champions to defend this right-to-know program,” said Purvis.  “EPA is on the wrong track, and Congress must redirect their attention toward reducing pollution and protecting public health.”
