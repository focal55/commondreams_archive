<p>WASHINGTON - February 24 - This Tuesday, an unlikely coalition of left and right, non-profits and small businesses, and Internet advocacy groups will hold a national telephone news conference call to announce an unprecedented combined campaign against AOL’s new “pay-to-send” email proposal – which amounts to an “email tax.” 

 

<p>Under AOL’s recently announced “certified email” proposal, large emailers willing to pay an "email tax" can bypass spam filters and get guaranteed access to people's inboxes—with their messages having a preferential high-priority designation. Charities, small businesses, civic organizing groups, and even families with mailing lists will have no guarantee that their email will be delivered unless they are willing to pay the "email tax" to AOL.
<p>AOL's proposed pay-to-send system is the first step down the slippery slope toward dividing the Internet into two classes of users—those who get preferential treatment and those who are left behind. The Internet is a force for democracy and economic innovation because it is open to all Internet users equally – AOL’s “email tax” would create an unleveled playing field and harm the Internet forever. 

 

<p>Tuesday’s 1pm EST conference call will be co-hosted by Internet free speech advocates the Electronic Frontier Foundation and media policy group Free Press.  Participants will include Craig Newmark of Craigslist and representatives from the Gun Owners of America, MoveOn.org Civic Action, and the Association of Cancer Online Resources. Dozens of other concerned groups will be announced on the call as members of the coalition, and details about the campaign will be announced on the call.
