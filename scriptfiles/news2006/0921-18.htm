<p>WASHINGTON - September 21 -Sen. Debbie Stabenow  (D-Mich.), and Rep. Jan Schakowsky (D-Ill.), joined Campaign for  America's Future co-director Roger Hickey and Americans United  communications director Brad Woodhouse on a conference call with  reporters today urging Congress to fix the harmful coverage gap  in the Medicare Part D prescription drug plan that this week will  cause the average Part D enrollee to lose coverage for their  prescription drugs.</p>
<p>   This gap in prescription drug coverage, popularly known as the  &quot;donut hole,&quot; denies coverage to individuals with annual drug  costs exceeding $2,250. Seniors and the disabled must pay nearly  $3,000 in out-of-pocket drug costs on top of costly monthly  premiums to regain coverage for the rest of the year. Outraged  citizens around the country have organized protests, petitions  and an innovative YouTube.com campaign urging Congress to  eliminate the donut hole. </p>
<p>   According to a new report released today by the House Ways and  Means Committee Democrats, about 7 million Americans in stand- alone prescription drug plans are at risk of falling into the  donut hole. This is in addition to the nearly 6 million Americans  with Medicare Advantage plans, most of which are also at risk of  falling into the donut hole. Campaign for America's Future has  found that the average Part D enrollee will lose coverage this  Friday, Sept. 22.</p>
<p>   A new report by Campaign for America's Future, released by  participants on the call today, details how the donut hole and  the other harmful provisions of Medicare Part D stem from  conservative policies bent on shrinking indispensable government  services and outsourcing government responsibility to the private  sector. </p>
<p>   &quot;This costly, confusing and corrupt prescription drug plan  written by and for the pharmaceutical and insurance companies  exemplifies the conservative ideology of governance -- outsource  essential government services to corporate cronies and pass the  bill on to the taxpayers,&quot; said Hickey on today's call. </p>
<p>   As a result, millions of seniors caught in the donut hole will  go to the pharmacy this fall and be forced to pay thousands of  dollars for prescriptions. </p>
<p>   &quot;Seniors in Michigan and around the country are stunned to  learn they are falling into Medicare's donut hole -- a gap in  coverage that will have them scrambling to pay thousands of  dollars for prescriptions they thought would be covered,&quot; said  Sen. Stabenow.  &quot;It didn't have to be this way, but  unfortunately, this Medicare prescription drug program was  created for the drug companies and not for seniors.&quot;</p>
<p>   Just as the gap in coverage is hitting Americans hardest, The  Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) has  launched a $10 million ad campaign via the Chamber of Congress to  help vulnerable members of Congress who voted for the Medicare  Part D prescription drug program. The pharmaceutical industry,  which helped write Part D, is recording record profits thanks to  the new program, and has already funneled more than $12.7 million  to largely Republican candidates in the 2006 election cycle.</p>
<p>   &quot;The Bush administration pushed through this sham of a  Medicare prescription drug benefit saying that it would help  seniors and people with disabilities,&quot; said Rep. Schakowsky, who  is the chief deputy Democratic whip. &quot;But, what we got was a plan  that shifts costs to seniors and people with disabilities while  padding the profit margins of drug and insurance companies.&quot; </p>
<p>   Since the Medicare Part D prescription drug plan was passed in  2003, there have been three amendments introduced in the House of  Representatives and one amendment introduced in the Senate  authorizing Medicare to use its bulk purchasing power to  negotiate the price of drugs, thereby reducing the cost of the  program and providing Congress with the funds to fill in the gap  in coverage. All four amendments have been rejected along  partisan lines.</p>
<p>   &quot;Because the drug companies' interests were put ahead of  seniors, taxpayers are paying a Cadillac price for a Pinto  prescription drug benefit for seniors.  Part D must be fixed to  provide a real prescription drug benefit that puts seniors  first,&quot; said Brad Woodhouse, spokesman for Americans United. </p>
<p>   The Campaign for America's Future is circulating an online  petition demanding that Congress fix Medicare's Part D disaster  immediately. Thousands have signed the petition and many are  responding to an innovative e-mail campaign to get citizens to  post videos on <a href="http://releases.usnewswire.com/redir.asp?ReleaseID=72931&Link=http://www.youtube.com">http://www.youtube.com</a> showing how they would get  rid of the donut hole. The Campaign for America's Future and  Americans United also recently launched an effort to destroy  nearly 70,000 donut holes outside members' offices - 1 for each  of the 100 seniors who are expected to fall into the &quot;donut hole&quot;  in coverage. And this week, thousands of Americans are  participating in more than 50 events across the country conducted  by Americans United. </p>
