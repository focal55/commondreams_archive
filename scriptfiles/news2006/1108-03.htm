<p>WASHINGTON - November 8 - Tonight we saw a historic voter uprising, prompted by the disaster in Iraq.  Voters have rejected the Bush administration, and given Democrats a mandate to lead the nation out of this quagmire.  This election should put the Bush administration on notice that we need a timetable for a responsible exit.

 

<p>We congratulate Speaker Pelosi for leading the charge. Tonight’s wins in Ohio, Kentucky, and New Hampshire prove that candidates do not need to sacrifice their principles to win – that voters rally around bold progressive leaders.

 

<p>In races around the country, MoveOn members made an unprecedented effort to get out the facts and get out the vote.  A few of the critical numbers:

 

<p>
<ul>
<li>$27 million in hard dollars raised – with $25 million focused on the House.  Average donation: $45. </li>
</ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Over 7 million person-to-person calls to drop-off voters in 50 swing districts, plus the major Senate races, through our Call for Change program.  More volunteers than in 2004 – a whopping 181,000.  In most cases, the number of calls into the winning districts far outstripped the winning margin. </li>
<li>$4 million on “red-handed” ads to target nine second and third-tier races.  Of the nine we’ve targeted, we’ve contributed to victories in five. Our ads exposed the special-interest money candidates took from oil companies, drug companies, and war profiteers early in these races. </li>
</ul>
<p>In the months ahead, we will focus on turning this mandate for change into action on the issues our members – and the nation – care about most: a responsible exit from Iraq, health care coverage, clean energy, and a fair democratic system.  

 

<p>Our members have worked for six years to create this change.  We’re glad this day has finally come.

 

<p>We’ve attached a list of the numbers of calls our members made in the districts that won the House.
