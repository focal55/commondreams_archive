<p>POLAND - May 18 - Greenpeace welcomed the ban on the sale of genetically engineered (GE)
seeds, which was approved yesterday by the President of Poland Lech
Kaczynski. The signing by the President was the final step for the GE
ban to come into force, the legislation was approved by both chambers
of the Polish Parliament in previous weeks. <br>
<br>
One of the amendments of the new act states that, "genetically
engineered varieties will no longer be registered in the National Seeds
Catalogue", another adds that trading of GE seeds is forbidden within
Polish territory. These regulations constitute a big step forward in
order to keep the country's agriculture completely free of GE crops. <br>
<br>
"This decision by the Polish President shows that political decision
makers are at last taking into account the serious perils connected
with planting of GE crops, these crops are not needed and pose a grave
danger to the environment, consumers and farmers' livelihoods," said
Maciej Muskat, Greenpeace GE campaigner in Poland. "The Government has
kept their word to Polish voters, farmers and environmentalists and
implemented this ban - a promise that was given prior to the last
election."<br>
<br>
The ban is a clear political signal that directly contravenes the
recent WTO ruling, the verdict declared EU member states national bans
on GE organisms are in breach of the rules of free trade. "Poland has
implemented this GE seeds ban in defiance of bullying from both the
European Commission and the WTO," said Mr Muskat.<br>
<br>
There are now 12 GE organism bans in seven EU countries, more than in
2003 when the US presented its case against the EU to the WTO. The
Polish announcement is a blow to US agro-chemical giants, as Poland is
the second biggest agricultural food producer in the EU.<br>
<br>
"Greenpeace will continue to work with and encourage other countries to
follow the Polish example, which has put environmental concerns and
sustainable agriculture above the profits of agro-chemical
conglomerates." Concluded Mr Muskat.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
