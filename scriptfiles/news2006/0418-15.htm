<p>WASHINGTON - April 18 - Global warming is an especially hot topic this Earth Day, and all over America, mayors are flexing their muscle to demonstrate what they can do to help solve the problem.

<p>"There are many reasons to be hopeful this Earth Day," said Carl Pope, Sierra Club Executive Director.  "Right now, the real leaders on global warming solutions can be found in America's cities and town halls. And these local energy solutions--like hybrid fleets, solar and wind power, and energy efficiency--are not only better for our environment, they save taxpayer dollars at the same time."

<p>The Sierra Club has launched a "Cool Cities" Campaign, encouraging mayors to take decisive action to curb global warming, lower energy bills, save taxpayer dollars, and protect our environment. Beginning with Seattle Mayor Greg Nickels, more than 220 mayors representing 43 million Americans have signed the U.S. Mayors Climate Protection Agreement to reduce global warming carbon-dioxide pollution in their cities. A complete map of all the cities is available at http://sierraclub.org/coolcities/

<p>The mayors have promised to cut global warming emissions by taking three bold steps - switching their municipal fleets to hybrid cars, employing energy efficient technologies in the delivery of city services and raising the percentage of energy they use from renewable sources such as wind and solar.

<p>Mayors are taking action in every region of the country, with steps as varied as they are inspiring.  Charlotte, North Carolina is converting its municipal fleet to hybrid cars.  Salt Lake City is upgrading its traffic lights with more efficient bulbs, saving 500 tons of heat trapping gas, and over $50,000 a year on the city's energy bill.  In Twin Falls, Idaho local officials are making the city's 11 schools more energy efficient and saving $3.5 million in the process. The local utility in Waverly, Iowa is paying farmers to install wind turbines on their land. And there are even more examples at http://sierraclub.org/coolcities

<p>"This Earth Day, there is a better way. The Cool Cities program is proving that we can stop global warming one city at a time," added Pope.

<p>AVAILABILITY: To speak with some of the Mayors who are shaping this national trend, please contact Orli Cotel at (415) 977-5627
