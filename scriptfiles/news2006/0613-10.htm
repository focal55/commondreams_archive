<p>WASHINGTON - June 13 - On the eve of Colombian President Álvaro Uribe Vélez's first visit to Washington since his recent re-election, Amnesty International called on President Bush and Secretary of State Rice to confront President Uribe regarding specific human rights violations committed by the Colombian Security Forces and to ask Uribe to provide information about how civilian authorities are investigating and prosecuting these cases. Killings and threats by paramilitaries in Colombia continue today, despite a government-sponsored "demobilization" process that is supposed to end this year. 

<p>"It's the Bush administration's duty to challenge Colombia on its poor human rights performance -- especially since the United States is funding their military to the teeth," said Curt Goering, Senior Deputy Executive Director of Amnesty International USA (AIUSA). "American tax dollars should not bankroll a blank check written to the Colombian Security Forces." 

<p>Amnesty International has reported eight death threats in the past two months issued to Colombian human rights defenders and NGOs by army-backed paramilitaries, some of which appear to be entirely new groups like the one calling itself "Autodefensas Unidas Nueva Generacion" or "Self-Defense Forces - New Generation." Amnesty International urges President Bush and Secretary Rice to discuss these matters with President Uribe in detail. 

<p>President Uribe's meetings in Washington on Wednesday come on the heels of the recent Department of State decision to certify that Colombia is making progress on human rights criteria, a step that allows continued U.S. military aid. The decision came just one business day after President Uribe was re-elected in Colombia on May 28, 2006, thus appearing to be a congratulatory gift from the United States. Amnesty International was deeply disappointed by the re-certification, which came in the face of new allegations of rights abuses committed by the security forces. 

<p>One week later, however, the U.S. Senate challenged the Bush administration's decision, putting a hold on $12.5 million of the aid in response to the certification, which had been made without adequate consultation with Congress and despite the ongoing reports of rights abuses. 

<p>"Amnesty International has supplied the administration with a wealth of information regarding reports of human rights violations committed by the Colombian military," said Eric Olson, Acting Director of Government Relations at AIUSA. "It's time they use these facts to confront President Uribe." 

<p>Amnesty International has called for a complete cessation of military aid to Colombia since 1994, due to the abysmal human rights record of the security forces and their ongoing collusion with paramilitaries.
