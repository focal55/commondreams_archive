<p>NEW YORK - May 11 - From May 11th to 16th, US conscientious 
objectors (CO's) and CO's from around the world 
will gather in New York City and Washington DC 
for Operation Refuse War, a week of conferences, 
demonstrations, and actions in celebration of 
International Conscientious Objectors Day, May 15th.

<p>Operation Refuse War will be an opportunity for

strategies and build community. Participants are

within the anti-war movement. In addition, 
Operation Refuse War will bring together

activities in a country where conscientious 
objectors face persecution or harassment. 
Previous locations have included the Balkans in 
2002, Israel in 2003, Chile in 2004, and Greece 
in 2005. In addition, a similar gathering of 
conscientious objectors has been held each year 
in Washington, DC to forward the rights of 
conscientious objectors in the United States. 
This year, CO's from the US and other countries 
will meet together to strengthen their common efforts.
