<p>WASHINGTON - December 1 - Irene Khan, Secretary General of Amnesty International, is to lead a mission to Lebanon and Israel and the Occupied Territories (including the West Bank and the Gaza Strip) to discuss human rights issues with members of the government and civil society.<br>
<br>
	Announcing the mission, Irene Khan said: &quot;This visit comes at a critical time where principled leadership is of the upmost importance. <br>
<br>
	&quot;During this climate of heightened tensions in Lebanon there is a risk that human rights could be trampled.<br>
<br>
	&quot;The conflict in Israel and the Occupied Territories is one of the most entrenched in the world: following the recent violence in Gaza, a fragile cease-fire has created a small opening for leaders to review their strategies and find a way forward. <br>
<br>
	&quot;As European governments prepare to discuss this conflict at the European Summit on 15 December, Amnesty International is calling for urgent attention to the long-standing human rights concerns.&quot;<br>
