<p> FRIGATE BAY, St. Kitts - June 20 - The  conservation community stood together today on the Marriott  Resort beach in St. Kitts, when 10 Greenpeace activists were  arrested as they landed on the beach in inflatable boats and  attempted to plant cardboard whale tails into the sand.  International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW) representatives were  present to show support for Greenpeace's peaceful demonstration  and for global whale conservation.</p>
<p>   The demonstration came on the last day of the 58th meeting of  the International Whaling Commission (IWC) taking place June 16 -  20 at the Marriott Resort in St. Kitts. Just yesterday, the IWC  passed a resolution by consensus stating that, &quot;the Commission  and Contracting Governments support the right to legitimate and  peaceful forms of protest and demonstration.&quot; St. Kitts and Nevis  was the only country which chose to take a reservation out on the  resolution.</p>
<p>   Patrick Ramage of IFAW was on the beach with Greenpeace and  said, &quot;IFAW is proud to be standing shoulder to shoulder with  Greenpeace in this campaign. The Greenpeace action today is  heroic, and draws attention to the fact that even while we win on  the vote count inside the IWC meeting, whales are being killed  out in the open sea by Japan, Iceland and Norway; and IFAW,  Greenpeace and other organizations of conscience are going to  continue to highlight and oppose this.&quot;</p>
<p>   IFAW is calling on IWC members to take a strong stand against  commercial whaling at this year's meeting of the International  Whaling Commission.
