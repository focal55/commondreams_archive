<p>NEW YORK   - April 20 - The American Civil Liberties Union today announced the filing of 
two friend-of-the-court briefs supporting its lawsuit challenging the National 
Security Agency&#8217;s illegal domestic spying program. One brief was submitted on 
behalf of six prominent leaders of the nation&#8217;s business community and the other 
by five leading civil rights organizations.
<P>&#8220;We stand today as Americans from many different walks of life, united in 
defense of our Constitution and the rule of law,&#8221; said Anthony D. Romero, 
Executive Director of the ACLU.&nbsp; &#8220;We welcome the support of business 
leaders and civil rights advocates who recognize that warrantless spying on 
Americans is harmful to our democracy and detrimental to our reputation in the 
global community.&#8221;</P>
<P>The signers of the civil rights friend-of-the-court brief are the <STRONG>National 
Association for the Advancement of Colored People</STRONG> (NAACP); <STRONG>American-Arab 
Anti-Discrimination Committee</STRONG>; <STRONG>Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund</STRONG>; 
<STRONG>United for Peace and Justice</STRONG>; and the <STRONG>Japanese Americans Citizens League</STRONG>.</P>
<P>Signing onto the business leaders&#8217; friend-of-the-court brief are: </P>
<P><STRONG>Michael Kieschnick</STRONG>, President, Chief Operating Officer, and a co-founder of 
Working Assets Funding Service, Inc., a telecommunications, credit card, and 
media company with over $100 million in annual revenue; </P>
<P><STRONG>Mal Warwick</STRONG>, founder and Chairman of Mal Warwick &amp; Associates, Inc., a 
leading provider of fundraising and marketing consulting services for domestic 
nonprofit organizations;</P>
<P><STRONG>Ronald Algrant</STRONG>, Senior Vice President of International Sales at HarperCollins 
Publishers and former Chair of the Freedom to Publish Committee of the American 
Association of Publishers;&nbsp; </P>
<P><STRONG>Adam Kanzer</STRONG>, General Counsel and Director of Shareholder Advocacy of Domini 
Social Investments.&nbsp; Domini is an investment firm that manages over $1.8 
billion in assets for its individual and institutional 
investors;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P><STRONG>Peter Strugatz</STRONG>, President of Strugatz Ventures, Inc., a private equity 
investment firm, and is the founder and co-CEO of IceStone LLC, a leading 
manufacturer of sustainable home building products; and,&nbsp; </P>
<P><STRONG>Joe Sibilia</STRONG>, President and CEO of Meadowbrook Lane Capital, an investment 
bank whose principals have over $17 billion worth of transaction 
experience.&nbsp; MBLC provides a wide range of investment banking and other 
financial and strategic services for its clients and owns a controlling interest 
in CSRwire, a global news distribution and resource service.</P>
<P>In their brief, the civil rights organizations pointed to decades of spying 
on Americans --&nbsp; including members of their organizations -- that was 
halted only after a congressional investigation in the 1970&#8217;s exposed the 
abuses. The groups said they believed the current NSA spying program &#8220;exhibits 
the same unchecked executive power that led to abusive surveillance of civil 
rights advocates and others in the past and circumvents the statute enacted 
specifically to prevent such surveillance from reoccurring.&#8221;&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>The brief signed by leaders in the business community highlighted the 
importance of confidential communications and trust in American democratic 
values to economic growth. &#8220;In order for this country&#8217;s international and 
domestic commerce to continue to thrive, it is imperative that the United States 
be perceived on the world stage as rigorously upholding its own laws, 
particularly with respect to the confidentiality of telephonic and electronic 
communications,&#8221; they said in their brief.&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>Since 2001, the NSA has been secretly intercepting the phone and e-mail 

communications of Americans without first obtaining judicial approval. According 
to the ACLU, the NSA spying program authorized by President Bush violates the 
free speech and privacy rights of innocent Americans and jeopardizes the free 
flow of information that is essential to democracy and that thousands of 
businesses, journalists and lawyers depend on for their livelihood.&nbsp; Under 
the program, the NSA is also engaging in wholesale datamining by sifting through 
millions of calls and e-mails of ordinary Americans. Saying that the Bush 
administration&#8217;s illegal spying on Americans must end, the ACLU filed its 
lawsuit against the NSA in January of this year.&nbsp; </P>
<P>The ACLU lawsuit was filed on behalf of a group of prominent journalists, 
scholars, attorneys, and national nonprofit organizations (including the ACLU) 
who frequently communicate by phone and e-mail with people in the Middle 
East.&nbsp; Because of the nature of their calls and e-mails, they believe the 
program is disrupting their ability to talk with sources, locate witnesses, 
conduct scholarship and engage in advocacy.&nbsp; The spying program has sparked 
national and international furor and has been condemned by lawmakers across the 
political spectrum.&nbsp; <BR>&nbsp;<BR>The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District 
Court in the Eastern District of Michigan, seeks a court order declaring that 
the NSA spying is illegal and ordering its immediate and permanent halt.&nbsp; 
Attorneys in the case are Ann Beeson, Jameel Jaffer and Melissa Goodman of the 
national ACLU, and Michael Steinberg of the ACLU of Michigan.&nbsp; The civil 
rights organizations are represented by Jonathan Hafetz of the Brennan Center 
for Justice.&nbsp; The business leaders are represented by Theresa A. Chmara at 
Jenner &amp; Block, LLP.</P>
<P>The government&#8217;s opposition brief is due May 19, to which the ACLU will 
respond May 26.&nbsp; Oral arguments are currently scheduled for June 
12.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>

sheets on the case law and on the NSA spying program, and links to statements
