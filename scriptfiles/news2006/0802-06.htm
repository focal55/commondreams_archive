<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON - August 2 - Detectives in San Diego arrested a 24-year-old man and two teenage boys in connection with Saturday&#8217;s attacks on six men outside the LGBT pride festival in San Diego's Balboa Park. According to media reports, the suspects will face charges of attempted murder with a hate crime enhancement and assault with a deadly weapon. The assailants allegedly attacked the victims with baseball bats and a knife while taunting them with anti-gay epithets. One of the victims remains hospitalized with a fractured skull.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Statement by Matt Foreman, Executive Director<br>
National Gay and Lesbian Task Force</strong></font></font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#8220;The hatred fueling these terrible attacks is not innate; it is learned. And who is teaching it? Leaders of the right wing, who use their vast resources, media networks and affiliated pulpits to blame lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people for all the ills of society. We have witnessed years of anti-LGBT organizing in California, and violence is an obvious and potent outgrowth of such malicious activity. It poisons culture and inspires some to believe that it is open season on lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people.</font></font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#8220;Our thoughts are with the men who were attacked and their families during this difficult time, and we stand in solidarity with San Diego's LGBT community in denouncing this violence and in working to build a safer world for all people.&#8221;</font><!-- #EndEditable -->
