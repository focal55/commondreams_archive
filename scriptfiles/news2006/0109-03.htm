<p>WASHINGTON - January 9 - Earlier today, Citizens  for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) filed a  complaint with the Department of Justice against Congressman  Jerry Lewis (R-CA), Chairman of the House Appropriations  Committee, and a possible contender for House Majority Leader.  The complaint asks the Attorney General to have the Public  Integrity Section initiate an investigation into the relationship  between Rep. Lewis and lobbyist Bill Lowery and Mr. Lowery's  firm, Copeland Lowery Jacquez Denton & White.</p>
<p>A recent story in the San Diego Union-Tribune asserts that Rep.  Lewis, as Chairman of the powerful House Appropriations  Committee, has approved hundreds of millions of dollars in  federal projects for Lowery's clients. In apparent return,  Lowery, his partners, and his firm's clients have donated 37  percent of the $1.3 million that Rep. Lewis's political action  committee has received over the past six years. </p>
<p>   In addition, at least one staffer has moved back and forth  between Rep. Lewis's and Lowery's offices: Jeffrey Shockey left  Rep. Lewis's employ in 1999 after which he joined Lowery's  lobbying firm. He remained with the firm until 2005, when he left  to return to work for Rep. Lewis. When he left, Lowery's firm  hired Shockey's wife, Alexandra, to represent some of her  husband's old clients, with the result that on behalf of her  husband's former partners, she now lobbies staffers who work for  her husband.</p>

<p>   Melanie Sloan, CREW's executive director, urged Attorney  General Gonzales and Public Integrity Chief Noel Hillman to  immediately commence an investigation into the Lewis/Lowery  relationship, stating, "it is a little Duke Cunningham mixed with  a lot of Jack Abramoff: Rep. Lewis doles out earmarks a la  Cunningham and Lowery plays Abramoff, offering an unending stream  of campaign contributions." Sloan continued, "Corruption in  Congress does not end with Tom DeLay or Jack Abramoff. There is  not just one scandal, but a host of unethical activities that  need to be investigated." </p>
<p>   CREW is seeking a Department of Justice investigation, in  part, because the House Ethics Committee has abdicated its  responsibility to police and investigate the conduct of Members  of the House of Representatives, leaving only the Department of  Justice to stand between the integrity of Congress and the rule  of cronyism and opportunism. </p>
