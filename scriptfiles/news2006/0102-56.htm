<p>WASHINGTON - January 2 - The U.S. Army is attempting to compel testimony from journalists for the 
prosecution of 1st Lieutenant Ehren Watada, the first commissioned 
officer to publicly refuse to deploy to Iraq.

<p>Independent journalist Sarah Olson has been subpoenaed to testify at a 
Jan. 4 pre-trial hearing and a February court-martial about her May 2006 
interview with Lieutenant Watada. Independent journalist Dahr Jamail is 
also on the prosecution's witness list to discuss his reporting on a 
speech given by Lieutenant Watada at an August 2006 convention. 
Information on their positions is available at: <a href="http://www.freepresswg.org">http://www.freepresswg.org</a><p>Watada is charged with one count of missing troop movement and four 
counts of conduct unbecoming an officer. Each of the four conduct 
charges relate to statements Watada made to the press. If convicted, 
Watada could spend up to four years in prison for his political statements.

<p>The following are available for interviews:

</a>DAVID GREENE, (Olson's attorney), <a href="mailto:dgreene@thefirstamendment.org">dgreene@thefirstamendment.org</a>
<p> Olson is an independent journalist and radio producer who has 
covered Iraq war veterans since 2003. She interviewed Lieutenant Watada 
in May regarding his decision to refuse to deploy to Iraq. She just 
wrote the piece "Why I Object to Testifying Against Lt. Watada" for 
Editor & Publisher. See: 
<a href="http://www.editorandpublisher.com/eandp/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003526248">http://www.editorandpublisher.com/eandp/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003526248</a><p> She said today: "I object to the Army's attempts to force my 
participation in their prosecution of political speech. This subpoena 
threatens to turn journalists into government investigators, erodes 
press neutrality, and ironically asks a journalist to build a case 
against press freedom and the First Amendment. These actions would have 
a profound chilling effect on dissenting voices in the United States." 
Her interview with Watada, "First Officer Announces Refusal to Deploy to 
Iraq," is available at: <a href="http://www.truthout.org/docs_2006/060706A.shtml">http://www.truthout.org/docs_2006/060706A.shtml</a><p>DAHR JAMAIL, <a href="mailto:mail@dahrjamailiraq.com">mail@dahrjamailiraq.com<br>
</a>DAN SIEGEL, (Jamail's attorney), <a href="mailto:dansiegel@aol.com">dansiegel@aol.com</a> <a href="http://www.dahrjamailiraq.com/hard_news/archives/newscommentary/000453.php">http://www.dahrjamailiraq.com/hard_news/archives/newscommentary/000453.php</a>
<p> Jamail is an independent journalist who included a speech given by 
Watada, at a convention in August 2006, in a news commentary posted on 
the Internet. Portions of the speech are being used by the prosecution 
to charge Watada with conduct unbecoming of an officer.
<p>  Jamail, who reported from Iraq for more than eight months, is on the 
witness list of the prosecution and may be called to testify as part of 
the prosecution. Jamail said today: "Forcing journalists to testify 
against their sources in a military court threatens to silence public 
dissent and fair press coverage. A free and fair press is the lifeblood 
of democracy. Without the ability of the press to adequately report 
dissenting perspectives on the occupation of Iraq, it is reduced to 
transcribing government and military press releases."
