<p>NEW MARKET, Tennessee    - July 6 - 

As the death toll of US troops 
in Iraq tops 2,500, and the nation turns 230, a 
diverse gathering of Americans under 30 will 
gather to strategize about building their 
generations' movement to end the war in Iraq at 
the historic Highlander Center in rural Tennessee.

<p>From July 7-9, young members of Iraq Veterans 
Against the War, student peace activists, and 
youth leaders from across the nation will meet 
together at the historic Highlander Center, site 
of key leadership gatherings of the Civil Rights 
movement in the 1950s and 60s. Representing more 
than 20 key progressive youth organizations, 
participants in the "STORY Collaborative to End 
the War" are working to redefine what their 
"peace movement" looks like. Building diverse 
alliances led by youth and young Veterans, these 
savvy young activists are using new media, 
digital story telling, and cultural strategies to send their peace message.

<p>"Young people today are up against some major 
challenges, including putting an end to this 
illegal war that is morally and fiscally 
bankrupting our country, and impacting our entire 
generation," said Katie Joaquin, an organizer of 
the STORY Collaborative from Oakland, CA. "We are 
converging at Highlander to share our stories - 
from personal accounts of Fallujah to kicking 
Army recruiters off our campuses - and, as young 
people who are inheriting the 'war on terror', we 
are strategizing about how to build a real future of peace and justice."

<p>The STORY Collaborative is a partnership of Iraq 
Veterans Against the War, the War Resisters 
League, and the Student Farmworker Alliance, 
convened by the STORY program (Strategy, Training 
and Organizing Resources for Youth) at 
smartMeme-a progressive multi-issue strategy 
organization. This unique alliance has tapped 
into diverse youth based constituencies from 
coast to coast and is using new communications 
strategies to organize the next generation of the 
peace movement. Participants are coming from 
California, Oregon, Washington, Arizona, North 
Carolina, Illinois, Iowa, Maryland, New 
Hampshire, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, New York, 
Vermont, Massachusetts, and Puerto Rico.

<p>Through digital story telling strategies, and 
using personal media tools like ipods, myspace, 
and cell phone camcorders, STORY Collaborative 
participants are documenting their experiences on 
the y(our) story online blog pages at 
changingthestory.org/iraq. As the collaborative 
convenes, youth and young veterans will be using 
this web space to continue their dialogue and 
share their insights and stories with their peers.

<p>"We are the echo-boom, Millennial generation and 
we are online, networked, and have a lot to say 
about the atrocity that is the war in Iraq," said 
Stephen Funk, a young Conscientious Objector from 
San Francisco. "We are students, war resisters, 
veterans, artists, visionaries, media makers, 
bloggers, bike riders, baristas, and 
storytellers. We are part of military families. 
We are part of Immigrant families. We are the new 
face of the peace movement and we are getting 
together to, talk strategy, share our stories, 
make music, create and collaborate to end the war in Iraq."

<p>The STORY Collaborative to End the War strategy 
retreat runs July 7-9, 2006. More information at:
