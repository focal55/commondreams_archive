<p>WASHINGTON - November 27 - The American Civil Liberties Union today applauded the Justice 
Department&#8217;s Inspector General for opening an investigation into the 
department&#8217;s role in the warrantless wiretapping program conducted by the 
National Security Agency. The White House agreed last week to give the Office of 
the Inspector General (OIG) the security clearances necessary to conduct the 
inquiry.</P>
<P>In a letter to the House Judiciary Committee, Glenn Fine, the Justice 
Department&#8217;s Inspector General, said that his office has "decided to open a 
program review that will examine the Department&#8217;s controls and use of 
information related to the program and the Department&#8217;s compliance with legal 
requirements governing the program.</P>
<P>The following may be attributed to Caroline Fredrickson, Director of the ACLU 
Washington Legislative Office</P>
<P>"We welcome this long overdue move and urge the OIG to seek the hidden truths 
about this program. We applaud Inspector General Fine for his perseverance in 
pushing for this investigation and hope it will be comprehensive and free from 
political pressure. No one, not even the president, is above the law</P>
<P>"While the OIG carries out this investigation, lawmakers in Congress must 
conduct their own oversight regarding this illegal program. They must also 
reject any attempt to sanction this unconstitutional program or provide immunity 
to those telecommunications companies that violated the law when they gave our 
private information to the government without judicial approval. The American 
people deserve to know who among us has been spied on without a warrant."
