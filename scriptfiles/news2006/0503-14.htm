<p>WASHINGTON - May 3 - The following is a  statement by People For the American Way Voters Alliance  President Ralph G. Neas, on North Carolina Republican  congressional candidate Vernon Robinson: </p>
<p>   &quot;There is no room in mainstream politics for Vernon Robinson's  bigotry and scapegoating. The Republican National Committee  should immediately repudiate his tactics, demand that he pull his  current radio ad  ( <a href="http://releases.usnewswire.com/redir.asp?ReleaseID=65109&Link=http://vernonrobinson.com/media/miller_mariachi.mp3">http://vernonrobinson.com/media/miller_mariachi.mp3</a> ),  and withhold all forms of support and urge Republicans to do the  same.</p>
<p>   &quot;It may be tempting to dismiss Robinson as a fringe candidate,  but he just successfully fended off two primary challengers and  his prolific fundraising makes him a credible threat. In 2004 he  raised nearly $3 million -- more than any other candidate in a  crowded field -- in an unsuccessful bid for Congress.</p>
<p>   &quot;His disgusting and incendiary ads during that campaign  secured him airtime on conservative talk radio and Fox News,  enabling him to tap a narrow but lucrative niche of intolerant  Americans. He has also received backing from the anti-immigration  lobby, including Congressman Tom Tancredo's Team America PAC and  Phyllis Schlafly's Eagle Forum PAC.</p>
<p>   &quot;Ken Mehlman and Republican leaders have a choice to make. Is  their party open to all Americans or is it the party of  scapegoating and bigotry?</p>
<p>   &quot;Despite nascent efforts by the RNC to reach out to minorities  and gays and lesbians, the party continues to look the other way  whenever it benefits from intolerance, which is quite often. If  the RNC continues its silence on Robinson it will prove that the  party is still trying to have things both ways.&quot;</p>
