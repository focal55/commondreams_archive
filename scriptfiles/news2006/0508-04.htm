<p>WASHINGTON - May 8 - With recent attention  focused on lobbying reform in Congress, two public interest  groups today called for an investigation into how former Rep.  Billy Tauzin, R-La., now head of the drug manufacturing  companies' lobby in Washington, inserted language into the drug  benefit bill to help big drug companies while he was negotiating  to land a $2 million per year job as president of PhRMA.</p>
<p>   Rep. Marion Berry, D-Ark., who served with Rep. Tauzin on the  Medicare Conference Committee, joined leaders from the two groups  - the Campaign for American's Future and Americans United - on a  conference call with reporters today to discuss a new report of  scandals surrounding the Medicare Part D prescription drug  program.</p>
<p>   The Campaign for America's Future released a report today that  chronicles how Rep. Tauzin, R-La., former chair of the  Congressional committee overseeing the passage of Part D, worked  hard to prohibit Medicare from negotiating with drug companies to  achieve lower prices for seniors.</p>
<p>   &quot;The Republican leaders on the committee paid more attention  to the pharmaceutical and insurance companies who contributed  millions of dollars to their campaigns than the needs of our  seniors,&quot; said Rep. Berry. &quot;There were even times when these  leaders shut my Democratic colleagues and I out of the room  during critical moments in this debate.&quot;</p>
<p>   Campaign for America's Future co-director Roger Hickey joined  Rep. Berry to release the report on today's call, noting that the  failure to negotiate prices cost Part D an extra $80 billion  annually.</p>
<p>   &quot;Part D took billions of tax dollars that could have provided  a comprehensive, guaranteed senior citizen drug benefit and put  them into the pockets of the pharmaceutical companies,&quot; said  Hickey. &quot;The consequences of his misconduct dwarfs villains like  Cunningham and Abramoff.&quot;</p>
<p>   American's United communications director Brad Woodhouse also  joined Rep. Berry and Hickey on today's call. Woodhouse called  Part D a &quot;sell-out to pharmaceutical manufacturers.&quot;</p>
<p>   &quot;Part D prohibits Medicare from using its bulk-buying power to  negotiate lower drug prices and denies senior citizens the choice  of a prescription drug benefit direct from Medicare,&quot; said  Woodhouse. &quot;Part D is better for industry than it is for  pharmacists, senior citizens or patients.&quot;</p>
<p>   Today's report examines the drug companies' $87 million in  federal campaign contributions between 1998 and 2005, including  $1.5 million to George Bush. Fully 69 percent of industry  contributions went to Republicans. Tauzin himself received  $218,000 in drug money between 1989 and his departure.</p>
<p>   Former Medicare chief Thomas Scully also receives scrutiny in  the report. Scully received an &quot;ethics waiver&quot; from the Bush  administration permitting him to hunt for his next job while  actively negotiating Part D on behalf of the administration. He  immediately left the administration to become a health industry  lobbyist.</p>
