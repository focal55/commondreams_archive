<p>GUANTANAMO - January 10 - The U.S. military commission 
hearing the case of a Canadian teenager due to start today at 
Guantánamo Bay should take into account that he was only 15 years old 
at the time of his alleged offense, Human Rights Watch said today. U.S. 
authorities are prosecuting the youth, Omar Khadr, now 19, for allegedly 
killing a U.S. soldier in Afghanistan in 2002. The Pentagon refused to 
recognize his juvenile status when he was apprehended and during his 
detention, raising concerns that it will not take his age into account in 
conducting the military hearing. 

<p>"The U.S. government ignored Khadr's rights as a child throughout his 
detention," said Jo Becker, advocacy director of the Children's Rights 
Division at Human Rights Watch. "The military commission should not 
do the same."   
  
<p>The Pentagon violated international juvenile justice standards by 
refusing to separate Khadr from adult detainees, to provide him with 
opportunities for education or to allow him direct contact with his family 
during his detention at Guantánamo. International standards require the 
use of detention only as a last resort, as well as a prompt determination 
of all cases involving children, yet Khadr was held at Guantánamo for 
more than three years before being charged. Khadr's attorneys claim that 
he was tortured at Guantánamo.   
  
<p>Khadr's detention also violated international law relating to the 
treatment of former child soldiers. Khadr is one of an unknown number 
of Guantánamo detainees who were apprehended as children for alleged 
participation in armed activities. Under a treaty banning children under 
the age of 18 from participating in armed conflict, ratified by the United 
States in 2002, the U.S. is obliged to assist in the demobilization and 
rehabilitation of former child soldiers within its jurisdiction. In 2004, the 
Pentagon released from Guantánamo three children, believed aged 
between 13 and 15 at the time of their capture, to rehabilitation programs 
operated by UNICEF in Afghanistan. However, it refused to consider 
Khadr and other child detainees under the age of 18 for similar 
rehabilitation programs, or to provide them with special protection at 
Guantánamo. The Pentagon has also refused to confirm the number of 
Guantánamo detainees who were under 18 when first detained.   
  
<p>International standards recognize that children under 18 are a 
particularly vulnerable group and entitled to special care and protection 
because they are still developing physically, mentally and emotionally. 
In its March 2005 decision abolishing the use of the death penalty for 
crimes committed before age 18, the U.S. Supreme Court found that 
juveniles are "categorically less culpable" than adult criminals. Recent 
findings in the field of neuroscience have confirmed striking differences 
between the brains of adolescents and those of adults, finding that 
adolescents are less able to control impulsive behavior or weigh the 
long-term consequences of their actions.   
  
<p>Because of children's relative immaturity and unique capacity for 
rehabilitation, international law emphasizes rehabilitation and social 
reintegration as a primary focus for all proceedings involving children. 
Trials of child offenders should take place before authorities trained in 
juvenile justice standards, should protect the best interests of the child 
and consider a range of sentencing options that will prepare the child to 
re-enter society.   
  
<p>Human Rights Watch reiterates its concerns that the military 
commissions created by the United States to try detainees for war crimes 
and related offenses fall far short of international standards for a fair 
trial.
