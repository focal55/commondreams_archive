<p>WASHINGTON - September 27 - U.S. Senators Russ Feingold (D-WI) and John 
          Kerry (D-MA) have introduced a resolution calling on state and local 
          governments to have back-up systems in place on election day to ensure 
          that every eligible voter who wants to vote is able to. The Senators&#8217; Sense of the Senate resolution notes the difficulties that voters in 
          many states have experienced with new voting technology and urges states 
          to do whatever is necessary to ensure that voters are actually able 
          to cast a vote on November 7, 2006, including providing emergency paper 
          ballots in the event of a voting machine failure. 
<p>&#8220;We cannot allow the American people to lose faith in the most 
          fundamental aspect of our democratic system &#8211; the right to vote,&#8221; 
          Feingold said. &#8220;Some of the problems we saw this year, like voters 
          in Maryland being told to come back later because the machines weren&#8217;t 
          working, are simply unacceptable. A back-up plan as simple as having 
          emergency paper ballots on hand is essential to preventing election 
          day disasters.&#8221;</p>
          
        <p>Kerry said, &#8220;It&#8217;s a disgrace that a Congress and an Administration 
          which talks about exporting democracy around the world ignores the challenges 
          of our own democracy right here at home. We have seen American citizens 
          disenfranchised in our elections for the simple reason that no effective 
          back up system was in place. That&#8217;s a national scandal. But here 
          we are, 42 days away from another election, and Congress has again dragged 
          its feet even after we mobilized 35,000 citizens to demand a hearing 
          for our Count Every Vote Act, even after what we saw just this month 
          in Montgomery County. We need emergency action now. That is why I am 
          co-sponsoring the Dodd-Boxer legislation to provide emergency paper 
          ballots and that is why Russ Feingold and I are introducing our resolution 
          today demanding election day back-up plans. We have a duty to ensure 
          that no citizen will be denied the right to vote in 2006.&#8221;</p>
          
        <p>Feingold and Kerry are also co-sponsoring legislation with Senators 
          Barbara Boxer (D-CA) and Christopher Dodd (D-CT) to help states make 
          paper ballots available in case of election day problems with electronic 
          voting machines. Feingold and Kerry introduced the resolution ahead 
          of Congress&#8217; adjournment for the 2006 elections. With the problems 
          some voters have already experienced during primary elections this year, 
          the senators believe the Senate should be on record supporting state 
          efforts to be prepared in the event of problems on Election Day. Earlier 
          this month, problems with new voting technology were reported in a number 
          of primaries around the country. </p>
