<p>WASHINGTON - June 26 - Human Rights Campaign President Joe 
Solmonese sent the following letter to the 203 members of the 
Pennsylvania House of Representatives, who are considering an amendment 
that would put discrimination into the state constitution and deny 
critical protections to thousands of Pennsylvania families.</p>

<blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<p>June 26, 2006</p>

<p>Members of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives<br>
Main Capitol Building<br>
Harrisburg, PA 17120-0028</p>

<p>Dear Honorable State Representative,</p>

<p>Pennsylvanians deserve a Constitution that protects all families, not 
one that separates out a group of your constituents for 
discrimination.</p>

<p>As you consider House Bill 2381, I am urging you on behalf of our 
more than 32,000 members and supporters in Pennsylvania to vote against 
discrimination and vote against H.B. 2381, or any amendment denying 
legal recognition to unmarried couples.</p>

<p>The Pennsylvania Constitution was created to expand rights, not take 
them away. This vote is motivated by anti-gay politics and it&#8217;s 
wrong.</p>

<p>Furthermore, this amendment could have sweeping consequences for the 
protection of civil rights of all Pennsylvanians. Once a Constitution is 
amended to take rights away from a group of people, it sets a dangerous 
precedent for everyone.</p>

<p>We should join with the U.S. Congress and eight state legislatures 
&#8212; Alaska, Illinois, Iowa, Maryland, Minnesota, New 
Hampshire,&#160;Washington and&#160;West Virginia&#160;&#8212; that have 
defeated discriminatory amendments this year already. In New Hampshire, 
82 Republicans in the House voted down the measure. Another three states 
are likely to defeat discriminatory marriage amendments by the end of 
the year.</p>

<p>Pennsylvania U.S. Sen. Arlen Specter&#8217;s vote against moving 
forward with an amendment to the U.S. Constitution this spring not only 
reversed his position from two years ago, but also puts him on the right 
side of history. Our elected officials must vote with a deep commitment 
to protect all of their constituents, not use a group of them as 
political pawns.</p>

<p>I urge you to reject the politics of discrimination, division and 
fear. Anything that treats gay and lesbian families as second-class 
citizens is inexcusable and un-American.</p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>Joe Solmonese<br>
<i>President of the Human Rights Campaign, the nation&#8217;s largest 
civil rights organization working to achieve gay, lesbian, bisexual and 
transgender equality</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Pennsylvania House passed an amendment that would deny not only 
marriage but also civil unions and domestic partnership benefits on June 
6, 2006, by a 136-61 vote. The Senate amended the language of the bill, 
removing the ban on civil unions and domestic partnerships, a maneuver 
that angered the extreme right. That version passed the Senate by a 
38-12 vote. The House is now considering that bill.</p>
