<p>WASHINGTON - November 8 - Working people across this country have spoken.&#160; By voting to change the leadership of Congress, and electing eight new pro-worker governors, they have said enough is enough.&#160;
<p>It&#8217;s important for the winning candidates to remember that this election is not just an accomplishment &#8211; it&#8217;s an opportunity. It&#8217;s a chance to put working people back at the center of the agenda for our country.&#160;</p>

<p>Today we celebrate, but tomorrow we go to work.&#160; While corporate CEOs make more and more money, the average worker has seen her wages go down and her health care costs go up.&#160; This election represents progress, but we still have a long way to go to give our children the future they deserve.</p>

<p>Yesterday, more progressive voices were heard.&#160; But today in Houston, striking janitors still make $21 a day with no health care and no benefits.&#160; We can&#8217;t rest until they and other workers across this country no longer have to struggle just to provide the basics for their families.</p>

<p>To Republicans, Democrats, and Independents, our message is the same:&#160; No more empty promises, no more rhetoric.&#160; Working people have put you in office, and we will hold you accountable if you don&#8217;t start working for us.</p>

<p>Congress has a lot of work to do to put the interests of working families first.&#160; We&#8217;re going to hold them to this standard.&#160; All elected officials need to know that today is only the first step on a long road to restoring the American Dream.&#160;</p>

<p>Working people have sent the message about what they want:&#160; quality, affordable health care; good jobs that can provide for a family; and retirement with dignity.&#160; The question now is whether our elected officials will listen and take action.<!-- #EndEditable -->
