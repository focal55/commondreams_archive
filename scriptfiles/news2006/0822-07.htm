<p>TACOMA, Washington - August 22 - In a military 
justice case that has drawn wide attention, the American Civil Liberties Union 
of Washington is backing the free speech rights of a soldier facing court 
martial for refusing to serve in the war in Iraq. The ACLU today submitted a 
friend-of-the-court brief contending that Lt. Ehren Watada should not be 
punished for his public statements expressing legal and moral objections to the 
war in Iraq. </P>
<P>The military is holding a hearing 
on August 17 to determine whether to go forward with court martial proceedings 
against Watada. The ACLU takes no position on his challenge to the lawfulness of 
the orders to report for duty in Iraq.</P><P>&#8220;Soldiers should not be 
court-martialed for explaining their views on important political issues when 
doing so does not adversely affect military functioning. Lt. Watada was 
exercising his free speech rights as a citizen in a democratic society,&#8221; said 
Kathleen Taylor, Executive Director of the ACLU of Washington. </P><P>Ehren&nbsp;Watada 
enlisted in the army after finishing college because he wanted to aid his 
country after the September&nbsp;11 terrorist attacks.&nbsp; He has been deployed in Afghanistan and 
Korea, and has received good reviews for his service.&nbsp; Lt. Watada became convinced that the war 
in Iraq is unlawful and that he has a duty as an officer not to participate in 
it. When he learned that his unit was to be deployed to Iraq, he made requests 
to be transferred elsewhere, but they were denied. In early June, he discussed 
his views on the war publicly, holding a press conference and speaking to 
individual reporters.&nbsp; On June 22, 
he refused to board the bus for his deployment to Iraq.&nbsp; </P><P>In addition to charges against 
Lt. Watada for refusal to report to duty, the military is seeking to penalize 
Lt. Watada for statements he made to reporters expressing his objections to the 
United States&#8217; involvement in the war in Iraq (see below). He is being charged 
with violating two articles of the Uniform Code of Military Justice: Article 88, 
which prohibits use of &#8220;contemptuous words&#8221; against the President and other top 
governmental officials; and Article 133, which prohibits &#8220;conduct unbecoming an 
officer&#8221; &#8211; that is, behavior which dishonors or disgraces an officer or 
&#8220;seriously compromises the officer&#8217;s character as a gentleman.&#8221; 
</P><P>The purpose of Lt. Watada&#8217;s 
public remarks was to explain the motivations for his actions. While one may 
disagree with Lt. Watada&#8217;s opinions on the war&#8217;s legality, the ACLU said in 
legal papers, his expression of those opinions reflected his deeply felt beliefs 
and showed a seriousness of purpose and high moral character. In speaking his 
mind, Lt. Watada expressed sharp disagreement with government policies and the 
actions of the President, but he did not use contemptuous language and did not 
behave in a dishonorable manner.</P><P>The following are the statements 
for which Lt. Watada is facing court martial:</P><P>Statement 1:&nbsp; &#8220;I could never conceive of our leader 
betraying the trust we had in him &#8230;. As I read about the level of deception the 
Bush administration used to initiate and process this war, I was shocked.&nbsp; I became ashamed of wearing the 
uniform.&nbsp; How can we wear something 
with such a time-honored tradition, knowing we waged war based on a 
misrepresentation and lies?&nbsp; It was 
a betrayal of the trust of the American people.&nbsp; And these lies were a betrayal of the 
trust of the military and the Soldiers&#8230;.But I felt there was nothing to be done, 
and this administration was just continually violating the law to serve their 
purpose, and there was nothing to stop them&#8230;.Realizing the President is taking 
us into a war that he misled us about has broken that bond of trust that we 
had.&nbsp; If the President can betray my 
trust, it&#8217;s time for me to evaluate what he&#8217;s telling me to do.&#8221; 
</P><P>Statement 2:&nbsp; &#8220;I was shocked and at the same time 
ashamed that Bush had planned to invade Iraq before the 9/11 attacks.&nbsp; How could I wear this [honorable] 
uniform now knowing we invaded a country for a lie?&#8221;&nbsp; </P><P>Statement 3:&nbsp; &#8220;It is my conclusion as an officer of 
the Armed Forces that the war in Iraq is not only morally wrong but a horrible 
breach of American law&#8230;.As the order to take part in an illegal act is 
ultimately unlawful as well, I must as an officer of honor and integrity refuse 
that order&#8230;.The wholesale slaughter and mistreatment of Iraqis is not only a 
terrible and moral injustice, but it&#8217;s a contradiction to the Army&#8217;s own law of 
land warfare.&nbsp; My participation 
would make me party to war crimes.&#8221; </P><P>The Army charges that the 
Statements 1 and 2 violated Art.&nbsp;88 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice 
(&#8220;Contempt Toward Officials&#8221;) and that all three statements violated 
Art.&nbsp;133 (&#8220;Conduct Unbecoming an Officer and Gentleman&#8221;).&nbsp; </P><P>ACLU of Washington Staff Attorney 
Aaron Caplan wrote the ACLU&#8217;s friend-of-the-court brief.</P><!-- #EndEditable -->
