<p>WASHINGTON - September 8 - <font face="Arial" size="2">A Government 
Accountability Office (GAO) report released today finds that recovery plans play 
an important role in the successful delisting of endangered species, reinforcing 
a position Defenders of Wildlife has long taken that emphasizes the need for 
comprehensive, science-based recovery strategies tailored to specific plants and 
animals. </font>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">"As the GAO report shows, recovery 
plans are vital tools that help biologists, stakeholders and landowners 
understand what needs to be done to recover a listed species effectively," 
stated Jamie Rappaport Clark, Executive Vice President of Defenders of Wildlife. 
"They outline the steps that need to be taken to halt a species decline and 
provide a roadmap for species recovery. They are an essential part of our 
efforts to implement the Endangered Species Act and recover endangered plants 
and animals."</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">The report, "Many Factors Affect the 
Length of Time to Recover Select Species," studied the length of time it takes 
to recover 31 species. It found that while recovery depends on a variety of 
factors, species with a recovery plan are more likely to recover. Other factors 
include the rate of reproduction, the presence of subspecies and the mitigation 
of primary threats. Of the 31 species studied in the report, 19 have been 
recently delisted, or are likely to be delisted within the next 25 years. The 
remaining 12 are likely to remain on the endangered species list for decades 
because the species are slow to reproduce, their habitat cannot be secured, or 
the biologists do not know enough about the threats facing them.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">"What this report’s findings do is 
reinforce the need to focus efforts on improving recovery provisions in the 
Endangered Species Act," stated Clark. "When recovery plans are in place, 
species are better protected and more closely managed. This means they are 
likely to come off the endangered species list more quickly. The report should 
also encourage stakeholders and landowners to assist service biologists in the 
recovery planning process knowing it works effectively."</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">"This report also serves as further 
proof that any serious Congressional attempt to reauthorize the Endangered 
Species Act needs to have species recovery guided by recovery plans," stated 
Clark. "Any rewrite without this provision as its centerpiece would likely not 
be as effective as it could be." </font></p><!-- #EndEditable -->
