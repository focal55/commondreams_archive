<p>WASHINGTON - August 8 - “It is a bad time to defend the status quo in America, and that’s why Democratic Senator Joe Lieberman and countless Republican incumbents running for re-election are having such a tough time.  The fact that a challenger such as Ned Lamont could have come from out of nowhere to a dead heat with a powerful, three-term Senator is a testament to the strength of the issues-- the Iraq war, our failed energy policy, our failing health care system--that are driving this campaign.

 

<p>People are tired of the Iraq War, sky-rocketing gas prices and out-of-control prescription drug costs. They want change. And that's not just true of Connecticut primary voters--it's true of a majority of Americans across the nation. 

 

<p>To move forward, America needs new leadership in Congress and the White House.  The 3.2 million members of MoveOn are committed to that goal.  And we see a blueprint for a broad Democratic victory this fall in Ned Lamont’s principled campaign.

 

<p>Whatever happens this evening, the Connecticut primary has put politicians on notice: if they’re covering for the Bush administration’s disasterous decisions, they’re going to be in trouble.

 

<p>What this challenge in Connecticut shows is that professional operatives in Washington DC no longer have a vice-grip on the political process.  As Jefferson and our nation’s founders intended, the voters do.”
