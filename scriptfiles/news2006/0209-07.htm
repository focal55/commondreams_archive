<p>WASHINGTON - February 9 - The American Civil Liberties Union expressed 
disappointment at the closed-door hearing held today by the Senate Select 
Committee on Intelligence on the warrantless spying by the National Security 
Agency. Attorney General Alberto Gonzales and General Michael Hayden, the deputy 
director of national intelligence, are expected to testify. The hearing 
coincides with revelations that the head of the Foreign Intelligence 
Surveillance Court (FISC) was warned that information illegally obtained by NSA 
may have been used to obtain wiretap warrants.</P>
<P align=justify>"Our democratic system relies on transparency and candor from 
the executive, and so far, we have seen neither," said Caroline Fredrickson, 
Director of the ACLU Washington Legislative Office. "The White House was quick 
to defend the program, but when pressed for the facts, it has refused to provide 
them. Congress must conduct oversight and let the American public know the 
answers to the critical questions surrounding this illegal program. An 
aggressive public relations campaign and secret hearings cannot restore the 
public&#8217;s confidence.</P>
<P align=justify>"Today&#8217;s revelations only further underscore the need to stop 
this illegal program," Fredrickson added. "Our legal system is based upon the 
Constitution. If courts are using evidence that is improperly obtained, we run 
the risk that legitimate threats to this country will go unpunished because 
crucial evidence has been ruled inadmissible. The warrantless NSA program 
undermines justice; adhering to the rule of law ensures that justice will be 
served properly."</P>
<P align=justify>The ACLU has challenged the legality of the program and called 
for a full and independent review of the warrantless spying by the NSA on 
Americans. Senate Judiciary Chairman Arlen Specter (R-PA) is drafting 
legislation to require the president to have the FISC review the program. House 
Judiciary Committee Chairman F. James Sensenbrenner (R-WI), who has yet to 
schedule a public oversight hearing on the program, sent the attorney general 
dozens of questions about the program on Wednesday. </P>
<P align=justify>Some lawmakers have suggested that Foreign Intelligence 
Surveillance Act needs to be modified. However, the ACLU believes that there is 
no need to change the existing law, but there is a need to properly enforce it. 
FISA specifically requires judicial review for the surveillance of domestic 
targets; the ACLU noted that the president took an oath to "faithfully execute 
the laws" and does not have the authority to choose which laws to follow.</P>
<P align=justify>Today&#8217;s <I>Washington Post</I> reported that twice in the past 
four years, Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly, the head of FISC, was warned by a 
Justice Department lawyer that information that was obtained through the 
warrantless NSA program may have been used to secure wiretap warrants from the 
secret court. Kollar-Kotelly has already expressed doubts about the legality of 
the warrantless wiretapping conducted by the NSA. According to the <I>Post</I>, 
at one point, her concerns lead to a temporary suspension of the program.</P>
<P align=justify>On Monday, Attorney Gonzales testified before the Senate 
Judiciary Committee, where he failed to answer basic questions from Senators 
about the program, sticking close to talking points and rhetoric rather than 
facts and figures. The ACLU said that concerns about the illegal NSA spying 
program remain, including: the number of Americans who have had their 
communications monitored or mined without a court order and how many resources 
have been wasted on this unlawful program. </P>
<P align=justify>On Wednesday, Congresswoman Heather A. Wilson (R-NM), chair of 
the House Intelligence Subcommittee on Technical and Tactical Intelligence, 
expressed "serious concerns" about the warrantless NSA domestic spying program, 
and called for a full congressional inquiry into the matter. The ACLU said that 
Wilson's stance underscores congressional frustration with the White House&#8217;s 
refusal to share information with a co-equal branch of government in violation 
of the plain language of laws passed by Congress. </P>
<P align=justify>Gonzales and Hayden briefed Wilson and other members of the 
House Intelligence Committee on Wednesday, but not all lawmakers were satisfied 
with the closed session. The ACLU also noted that the White House had failed to 
properly inform the House and Senate Intelligence Committees since the start of 
the program, as required by the law. The non-partisan Congressional Research 
Service agreed with the same assessment of Congresswoman Jane Harman (D-CA), the 
Vice-Chair of the House Intelligence Committee.</P><P align=justify>"We applaud those lawmakers, from both sides of the aisle, who 
have demanded the truth from the government," said Lisa Graves, ACLU Senior 
Counsel for Legislative Strategy. "The rule of law has been broken, and Congress 
and the public have a right to know. Effective and public oversight can be done 
without compromising state secrets. The administration must stop using national 
security as a blanket reason to keep their illegal activities hidden in the 
shadows."</P>
