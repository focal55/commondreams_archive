<p>WASHINGTON - August 29 - International aid  agency Oxfam America today called on President George Bush to  accelerate delivery of the promise he made to the nation one year  ago to confront with bold action generations of poverty that have  deprived residents on the Gulf Coast of the full array of  American opportunity, saying renewed commitment by public  officials at all levels of government, led by the Administration,  is required to ensure the region can build back better. </p>
<p>   &quot;On the anniversary of the costliest storm in U.S. history --  Hurricane Katrina -- our president and his administration owe it  to the people of the Gulf Coast to match their words with  action,&quot; said Oxfam America's Minor Sinclair, director of its  U.S. regional office. &quot;Billions of dollars allocated for the  recovery have yet to reach the region. And the way the housing  reconstruction rules are written now, tens of thousands of poor  homeowners and renters will never see a penny of that help.&quot; </p>
<p>   The group said a severe shortage of affordable housing is now  gripping the region because of the storm and poor governmental  policies from federal to local levels. Rents in some locations  have climbed 25 to 30 percent, squeezing the Gulf Coast's poorest  residents out of the market. The crisis could only worsen if the  18-month allowance on tens of thousands of FEMA trailers isn't  extended, the group said. If evicted, families sheltered in those  trailers will face a scramble for housing that the region is  entirely incapable of meeting.</p>
<p>   &quot;From the rural parishes of Louisiana to the poor urban  neighborhoods of Biloxi, Miss., decent, affordable housing must  be the foundation on which this recovery is built,&quot; said  Sinclair. &quot;Without homes, neither families nor the businesses  they support can return. Without people, without jobs, there will  be no Gulf Coast recovery.&quot;</p>
<p>   The impact of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita on rental housing  was immense. In Mississippi, 80 percent of the rental units in  the state's three coastal counties were damaged. And in  Louisiana, 40 percent of the homes that were destroyed or  severely damaged were rental properties. A total of 84,000 rental  units were damaged or destroyed in the state. Yet neither state  has a recovery plan that allocates nearly enough assistance to  replace these lost homes. In Louisiana, the Road Home plan only  covers 12.5 percent of the need.  In Mississippi, there is as yet  no plan to bring back affordable private rental units.  </p>
<p>   &quot;Ensuring that people have access to affordable housing that  is decent and convenient to jobs and schools is the first step in  helping them climb out of poverty,&quot; said Sinclair. &quot;This  administration talked about its duty to address a legacy of  inequality. Housing is the place it should start. And today is  the day it should lay the cornerstone.&quot; </p>
