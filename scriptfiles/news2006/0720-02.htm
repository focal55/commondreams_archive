<p>WASHINGTON - July 20 - The Government Accountability Project (GAP) applauds Senators Edward M. Kennedy (D-MA) and Jim Bunning (R-KY) for issuing a letter to Secretary of Energy Samuel Bodman, calling on the Department of Energy (DOE) to refrain from taking any action to implement a proposed dismantlement of the DOE Office of Environment, Safety and Health, until Congress has an opportunity to fully review and consider the proposal. Senators Kennedy and Bunning have been leaders in the effort to secure greater health and safety protections for DOE employees, including cosponsoring legislation to establish enforceable worker safety and health standards at DOE facilities and to compensate them for occupational illnesses. The letter can be viewed on GAP’s Web site at: <a href="http://www.whistleblower.org/doc/EH7.18.06.pdf%20" target="_new">http://www.whistleblower.org/doc/EH7.18.06.pdf

</a>
<p>“The DOE self regulates nuclear and worker safety for its 130,000 contractor employees and this plan will, contrary to DOE statements, significantly weaken oversight and diminish leadership in an area where DOE has historically failed” stated GAP Communications Director Dylan Blaylock. “We urge Secretary Bodman to follow the bipartisan counsel offered by Senators Bunning and Kennedy and cease any dismantlement until the DOE plan is made public and Congress can study it, and if necessary, hold hearings.”

<p>Numerous other letters from unions, organizations and politicians have been sent to the DOE, urging the stopping of ES&H’s dismantlement. Many of these letters appear on GAP’s Web site, <a href="http://www.whistleblower.org" target="_new">www.whistleblower.org</a>, including those sent by: Governors Bill Richardson (D-NM) and Christine Gregoire (D-WA); Sen. Jeff Bingaman (D-NM); Representatives John Dingell (D-MI), Bart Stupak (D-MI) and Ted Strickland (D-OH); Rep. Udall (D-NM); Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board; American Society of Safety Engineers; United Steelworkers Union; Building and Construction Trade Department; and three former heads of ES&H.
