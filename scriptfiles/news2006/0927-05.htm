<p>WASHINGTON - September 27 - In mid-June, Public Citizen, Common Cause and Public Campaign Action Fund asked all candidates registered with the Federal Elections Commission to sign a pledge that, if adhered to, will make a quantum leap toward removing the corrosive influence of money in politics and cleaning up Congress.
<p align="left">We call it the &#8220;Voters First&#8221; pledge because by signing it, candidates promise to put the interests of voters ahead of corporate moneyed interests &#8211; the interests that now pay huge sums of money to help congressional candidates get &#8211; or keep &#8211; their elected seats.</p>

<p align="left">As of this moment, 300 candidates have signed the pledge. You can find their names on a new interactive Web site that we have launched at&#160;<a href="http://www.votersfirstpledge.org/">VotersFirstPledge.org</a>.</p>

<p align="left">What did candidates pledge to support?</p>

<p align="left">By signing the &#8220;Voters First&#8221; pledge, they agreed to support legislation that accomplishes three critical goals:</p>

<p align="left">First, to make elections fair through campaign spending limits and public funding for all candidates who agree to take no private contributions.</p>

<p align="left">Second, to restore accountability by passing and enforcing meaningful new restrictions on gifts and travel from lobbyists and other powerful interests for members of Congress; and</p>

<p align="left">Third, to require full disclosure on the Internet of all lobbyists&#8217; contributions and any fundraising help members of Congress receive from lobbyists.</p>

<p align="left">These three actions are critical to putting democracy back in the hands of all citizens.</p>

<p align="left">Average citizens should be able to run for office without having to sell out to big moneyed interests or be millionaires themselves.</p>

<p align="left">Leveling the playing field is critical to holding our elected officials accountable to everyone and not just the interests of big business.&#160;</p>

<p align="left">What will we do now? We will be encouraging voters &#8211; millions of them &#8211; to contact candidates who have not signed and urge them to do so.</p>

<p align="left">More than a dozen national and state organizations have agreed to e-mail their members about the &#8220;Voters First&#8221; pledge and ask them to contact their representatives in the coming weeks. These e-mails will reach more than two million voters.</p>

<p align="left">We also will be encouraging our members to use an &#8220;activist toolkit&#8221; that contains tips on writing to candidates and sending letters to the editor; urges voters to make their voices heard at town hall meetings and campaign events; provides sample questions and materials about the &#8220;Voters First&#8221; pledge that voters can give to candidates; and provides fact sheets and information about national polling in support of clean elections, as well as information on successful public funding of elections in many states.</p>

<p align="left">The Web site contains an interactive map that allows the public to search by state and party affiliation to learn which candidates have signed the pledge.</p>

<p align="left">The site also has information about each candidate and allows activists to share stories about candidate responses to requests to sign the pledge.</p>

<p align="left">Because we get new signers each day, we will continue to provide updates of the number of signers periodically throughout October.</p>

<p align="left">Signing the pledge and supporting these crucial reform measures constitute a necessary first step in restoring faith and integrity in our democracy.</p>
