<p>WASHINGTON - February 23 - Today, NARAL Pro-Choice  America, the nation's leading advocate for personal privacy and a  woman's right to choose, called the passage by both houses of  South Dakota's legislature of a criminal ban on abortion  throughout pregnancy a monumental setback for women.</p>
<p>   &quot;The actions of the South Dakota legislature are a chilling  reminder of the lengths to which anti-choice lawmakers will go to  interfere in our most difficult and personal decisions,&quot; said  Nancy Keenan, president of NARAL Pro-Choice America.  &quot;This bill  contains an inadequate exception to protect a woman's life and no  other exceptions -- not for rape, not for incest, not even to  protect the woman's health. Clearly emboldened by President  Bush's judicial appointments, South Dakota has passed dangerous  and unconstitutional legislation that its supporters admit is a  direct attack on Roe v. Wade.  Rather than continuing these  unconstitutional assaults that threaten to endanger women's lives  and imprison doctors, these legislators should commit to enacting  commonsense legislation to prevent unintended pregnancy.&quot;</p>
<p>   With today's vote, the total abortion ban (HB 1215) has passed  both houses of the South Dakota legislature and now goes to anti- choice Gov. Mike Rounds, possibly as early as this week.  Gov.  Rounds, who has not indicated whether he will sign the bill, has  said that, &quot;(a)bortion ... should always be illegal.&quot;   </p>
<p>   Keenan continued, &quot;South Dakotans who cherish the fundamental  American values of freedom and personal responsibility must call  on Gov. Rounds to veto this egregious legislation.  We should  work to reduce the need for abortion, not continue to battle  about Roe v. Wade.&quot;
