<p>WASHINGTON - February 3 - The International Atomic Energy Agency is scheduled to continue to meet this weekend on the case of Iran. The following are available for interviews:<br />

<b><a href="mailto:vmjc1954@gmail.com">MORDECHAI VANUNU</a></b><br />
Vanunu revealed Israel's nuclear weapons arsenal in 1986, at which time he was jailed by the Israeli government. In April 2004, he was released from prison but continues to be under severe travel limits and other restrictions. He notes that while Iran is being accused of wanting to secretly develop nuclear weapons, "that is what Israel did 40 years ago." Israel, India and Pakistan have refused to sign the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, which Iran has signed. While the U.S. government has made many accusations about Iran and Iraq, it refuses to publicly acknowledge the existence of Israel's nuclear weapons arsenal, estimated at between 60 and several hundred warheads. Vanunu, who is in Jerusalem, has been frequently nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize. His next court date is scheduled for Feb. 9.<br />
