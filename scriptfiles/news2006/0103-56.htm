<p>WASHINGTON - January 3 - WakeUpWalMart.com,
America's campaign to change Wal-Mart, began the New Year by officially
announcing the group had achieved a series of record milestones during its
2006 "Hope for the Holidays" campaign, including reaching over 306,976
supporters as of Dec. 31, 2006. In stark contrast, Wal-Mart experienced its
worst holiday same-store sales performance in six years -- even worse than
last year's poor performance.
    <p>As a result of a mounting public image problem, worker unrest and
management woes, Wal-Mart's same store sales for December rose 1.6 percent
-- significantly lower than last year's disappointing 2.2 percent increase.
In fact, over the last six years, Wal-Mart's December same-store sales
performance has steadily declined from 8.0 percent in 2001 to 1.6 percent
in 2006. A breakdown of Wal-Mart sales performance between 2001 and 2006 is
below.
   <p> "Even with unprecedented price cutting, a November decline in
same-store sales, and an extremely low December comp, Wal-Mart faces the
harsh reality of another poor holiday season. Wal-Mart must wake up and
realize that the American people care about values, and want America's
largest employer to change for the better. The big question for Wal-Mart
this year is will 2007 finally be the year that Wal-Mart realizes its image
problem is now its business problem and it is time to wake up and do what
is right for America? We can only hope," said Paul Blank, campaign director
for WakeUpWalMart.com.
 <p>   During the last two months of 2006, WakeUpWalMart.com executed its most
ambitious and aggressive holiday campaign to date. The group's six-week
non- stop 2006 Hope for the Holidays campaign achieved new records in
grassroots support by building 1,172 events in 43 states, distributing over
400,000 flyers and holding actions such as candlelight vigils and press
conferences at over 925 Wal-Mart stores during the holiday season.
   <p> Wal-Mart's December Same-Store Sales Performance 2001-2006 (combined Wal-
Mart Stores & Sam's Club):

  <p>  -- 2006: 1.6 percent<br>

    -- 2005: 2.2 percent<br>

    -- 2004: 3.0 percent<br>

    -- 2003: 4.3 percent<br>

    -- 2002: 2.3 percent<br>
