<p>WASHINGTON - July 13 - Yesterday, a Connecticut trial court judge ruled thatsince same-sex couples in the state now have civil unions, they cannot demonstrate a sufficient harm from not having marriage. The ruling came from a trial court level, the same level court that had in years past ruled against the famous Massachusetts <i>Goodridge v. Department of Public Health</i> case, a case that eventually went on to win at the commonwealth’s highest court and became the first to grant full marriage equality to same-sex couples.

<p>“The case for full marriage equality in Connecticut continues despite this bump in the road,” said Human Rights Campaign President Joe Solmonese. “We knew the fight for marriage would neither be easy nor quick, but the country is on a clear trajectory toward equality and we must never give up until we reach that point. I look around and see so many positive advancements, from the foster care case in Arkansas to the movement of the American people 10 points in support of marriage fairness since 2004. It is incumbent upon us to continue the energy and dedication we have brought to this fight since day one.”
