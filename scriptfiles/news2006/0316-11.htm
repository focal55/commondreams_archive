<p>SILVER SPRING, Maryland - March 16 - Peace Action Education Fund (PAEF) will participate in at least 50 events in 15 states over the next week to bring our troops home and rebuild Iraq. These events are part of over 500 events in the United States called by United for Peace and Justice -- a coalition of over 1,300 groups -- and several hundred events outside the U.S.

<p>"George Bush's invasion of Iraq three years ago has cost this country dearly and it's time to bring the troops home and begin the healing. Bush's war has destroyed tens of thousands of lives, made the U.S. one of the most loathed countries in the world, and left Iraq in the midst of a civil war brought about by the occupation," said Kevin Martin, executive director of PAEF.

<p>"The U.S. House is poised to approve another $72 billion 'emergency supplemental' appropriation to further fund Bush's failure in Iraq. To begin the healing and to work towards peace, Congress should be demanding a troop withdrawal. The only 'emergency supplemental' budget should be to fund the urgent need to ensure the safe exit of our troops," concluded Mr. Martin.
