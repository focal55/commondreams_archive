<p>WASHINGTON - January 19 - Statement of Congressman Dennis J. Kucinich (D-OH) on indictments brought against employees and a contactor at the Davis Besse Nuclear Power Plant:
<p>“The alleged criminal acts by employees and a contactor of First Energy put the health and well being of millions of people in Northern Ohio at grave risk. </p>
<p>“The Government Accountability Office (GAO) has called the near catastrophic event at the Davis Besse Nuclear Power Plant, ‘the most serious safety issue confronting the nation’s commercial nuclear power industry since Three Mile Island’. </p>
<p>“I commend the work of United States Attorney Greg White, but the buck does not stop with a couple of mid-level managers and a consultant. Those at the top levels of First Energy must also be held accountable. From day one, First Energy executives have been more interested in protecting their bottom line then protecting public safety.&nbsp; </p>
<p>“Let’s be clear. The near fatal incident at the Davis Besse Nuclear Power Plant is not the fault of a ‘few bad apples’ but, the failure of an entire company and those responsible for running it. </p>
<p>“These indictments serve only to reinforce my call to revoke First Energy’s license to run a nuclear power plant. Even with these indictments, the root problem remains. First Energy has cultivated a culture of corner-cutting and reckless endangerment of public safety instead of a culture of safety.</p>
<p>“No one is above the law. I will continue to pursue this issue until all of those responsible for this near fatal disaster are held responsible and brought to justice.”</p>
