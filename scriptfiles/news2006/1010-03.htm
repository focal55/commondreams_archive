<p>WASHINGTON - October 10 - The United  States is lagging behind Europe in job creation, according to a report by the  Center for Economic and Policy Research. In the 1990s, the United States  developed a reputation as a &quot;jobs machine&quot; capable of creating jobs  at a far faster rate than Europe.&nbsp; However, between 2000 and 2005, U.S. employment grew more slowly than in  the European Union. 
<p class="regtext">The briefing paper, &quot;<em>Whatever Happened to the  American Jobs Machine?,</em>&quot; by economist John Schmitt, analyzed total job growth in the United States and the European  Union (EU-15) as measured by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and  Development (OECD). The OECD&rsquo;s data show that the American jobs machine is  ailing.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="regtext">To  read the paper, see: <a href="http://www.cepr.net/publications/jobs_machine_10_05_2006.pdf">http://www.cepr.net/publications/jobs_machine_10_05_2006.pdf</a></p>
<p class="regtext">&ldquo;I think most Americans would find it remarkable that France  actually created jobs at a faster rate than the United States did between 2000  and 2004,&quot; said Schmitt. &quot;In 2005, the United States finally managed to pull ahead of  France, but we still trail behind Europe as a whole.&quot; </p>
<p class="regtext">Since 2000, Spain, Ireland, Greece and Italy all have  managed to create jobs at a faster rate than the United States. The UK and  Belgium have matched U.S. job growth rates in the current decade through 2005.  France, Finland, and Sweden have trailed fairly closely behind the United  States. </p>
