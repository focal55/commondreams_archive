<p>WASHINGTON - December 5 - I'm delighted to be here with my partners in reform over the years. 
          We have fought many battles together over the past decade. And I think 
          we have some great opportunities in the next two years to make significant 
          progress on a number of issues of great importance to the fair functioning 
of our government.
<p>And as Senator McCain indicated, the first opportunity, of course, 
          is ethics and lobbying reform. I'm very pleased that the incoming speaker 
          of the House and now the incoming majority leader of the Senate have 
          decided not only to put these issues at the top of the
          agenda, but to make them the very first order of business.</p>
        <p>That's the right thing to do, because the election results and the 
          exit polls show that combating corruption in Congress must be a top 
          priority.</p>
        <p> The Congress that is about to conclude had a chance to face these 
          problems and enact strong reform. But the House and the Senate had extensive 
          hearings and considered legislation, but the leaders really believed 
          that the public didn't care about these issues, and they let it die. 
          But we found out on November 7th just how wrong they were.</p>
        <p>It's clear to all of us here that we must deal with ethics and lobbying 
          reform quickly, and we must take bold action. That is actually what 
          the public is demanding. And we ignore them again at our peril. I think 
          the new leadership in both the House and the Senate is ready to do this, 
          and I am already working with them.</p>
        <p>Let me just mention a couple of touchstones. Obviously I agree with 
          all of the things that Senator McCain was talking about. But let me 
          reiterate how we need an airtight lobbying gift ban -- airtight, no 
          ambiguity, no loopholes.</p>
        <p>We need to crack down, as Senator McCain said, on privately funded 
          travel. We need to make sure that anyone who uses a corporate jet for 
          any purpose pays the full charter rate for that flight.</p>
        <p>I think we need to stop the revolving door, not just by extending the 
          time of the cooling-off period, but by actually restricting lobbying 
          activities during that period, not just lobbying contact.</p>
        <p>And, yes, we need a tough, independent ethics enforcement process that 
          the American people can respect and trust.</p>
        <p>I am working on a bill that will include these components and will 
          be introduced on the very first day of the Congress. This bill will 
          set out the very best package of reforms, both our ethics rules and 
          the Lobbying Disclosure Act. And I hope it gives the American people 
          a way to measure the reforms that the Senate ultimately passes. </p>
        <p>And I look forward to working with my colleagues on that bill or other 
          bills as we always do. These six people were intimately involved with 
          every detail of the McCain-Feingold bill for many years and we do know 
          how to work together.</p>
        <p>And, finally, let me say -- and I feel grateful for Senator McCain 
          calling on me again to work with him -- that we're not done with campaign 
          finance reform either. It will be handled separately from a procedural 
          point of view. But we all said at the time that McCain-Feingold was 
          a must &#8211; an important improvement of the system, which it's been.</p>
        <p>But our 527 bill is more necessary than ever after the last election. 
          And I think the presidential public funding bill will get a lot of attention 
          as 2008 gets underway. We are ready to proceed with those bills as of 
          the beginning of the Congress as well.</p>
        <p>So, again, I truly enjoy working with this group and I think we can 
add to our list of successes.</p>
