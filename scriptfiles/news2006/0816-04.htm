<p>WASHINGTON - August 16 -  <span class="city">Manila</span>, <span class="country">Philippines</span> &#8212; 
      The Greenpeace ship MY Esperanza has arrived in the Philippines today, on the latest leg of her global Defending Our Oceans expedition to highlight the wonders and the environmental threats to the world's oceans and to campaign for the establishment of marine reserves.
</p>
    Scientists recognize the Philippine archipelago as the world's centre
of marine biodiversity, but the country's rich marine ecosystem is
severely threatened by pollution from diverse sources.<br>
<br>
"The oceans give our planet life but in return we are emptying them of
fish, heating them with climate change, and filling them with toxics
pollution," said Von Hernandez, Greenpeace Southeast Asia Campaign
Director. "In the Philippines, we find some of our important marine
ecosystems suffocating from pollution from industries, sewage, and
trash. Millions of Filipinos depend on these marine resources for
survival, yet we are destroying them at an alarming rate."<br>
<br>
This is the Esperanza's maiden voyage to the Philippines, in a journey
that started from an action packed face-off with Japanese whalers in
the Southern Oceans, to chasing pirate fishers in West Africa. The
Defending Our Oceans expedition aims for the establishment of a global
network of marine reserves, where 40 percent of the world's oceans is
protected from exploitation.<br>
<br>
In the Philippines, Greenpeace will campaign against plastics pollution
in Manila Bay and draw attention to the damage being caused by
Australian mining firm Lafayette's toxic spills in the marine ecosystem
of the South Eastern tip of Luzon. The Esperanza will also highlight
the country's successful implementation of a community-managed marine
reserve in Apo Island, which now provides food and income to the host
community, and will help promote it as a model for marine reserves
worldwide.<br>
<br>
The waters of the Philippines are home to over four hundred species of
coral, more than two thousand fish species and are an important area
for marine mammals, sea turtles, sharks and rays, including the whale
shark --the world’s biggest fish. However, a scientific study from 2005
(1) lists the Philippines as the most highly threatened centre of
unique marine species, citing the danger of mass extinction in a scale
similar to that of the destruction of the Brazilian rainforests.<br>
<br>
"The Philippine government acknowledges habitat degradation, pollution,
and destructive fishing as among the most pressing threats facing the
country's marine ecosystems," added Hernandez. "Yet the government's
clear bias towards exploitation, as shown by its all-out support for
destructive mining operations which impact on marine life, proves that
the government itself has become part of the problem."<br>
<br>
Greenpeace is an independent, campaigning organisation, which uses
non-violent, creative confrontation to expose global environmental
problems, and to force solutions essential to a green and peaceful
future.<br>
