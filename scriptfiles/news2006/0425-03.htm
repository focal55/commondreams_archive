<p>WASHINGTON - APRIL 25 - ONE: The Campaign to  Make Poverty History announced its new website today, continuing  an unprecedented campaign to reach and engage millions of  Americans in the fight against global AIDS and extreme poverty at  <a href="http://releases.usnewswire.com/redir.asp?ReleaseID=64518&Link=http://www.one.org">http://www.one.org</a>.</p>
<p>   &quot;For the first time in history, we have the ability to beat  global AIDS and extreme poverty, all we need is the will to do  it,&quot; said ONE CEO Paul Dioguardi.  &quot;These leaders are using their  time and technology to reach millions of Americans with a call to  do even more to save lives in Africa and the world's poorest  countries.&quot;</p>
<p>   The new site was designed by a volunteer team of industry  leaders from across the technology world.  Volunteers from  Microsoft and Adobe conceptualized and designed the new ONE.ORG  website, and development was completed by Adobe and Metaliq in  Adobe's Flash(r) and in HTML.  Akamai also provided ONE with  streaming technology that allowed for global on-demand capacity  for its new ONE &quot;Click Spot&quot; video on the homepage.</p>
<p>   The site collaboration came out 2004's TED Conference, where  lead singer of U2 and DATA (Debt, AIDS, Trade, Africa) co-founder  Bono won the TED Prize and made one of the prize's &quot;wishes&quot; that  technology leaders would step forward to help engage more than  one million Americans in the fight against global AIDS and  extreme poverty. </p>
<p>   To date, over 2 million people have joined ONE by visiting  ONE.ORG and the campaign has used the website to engage and  mobilize visitors in successful efforts to call for life-saving  global commitments for Africa and the world's poorest countries,  including 100 percent debt cancellation, increased effective  international assistance and universal access to education and  HIV/AIDS medicines.</p>
<p>   The ONE.ORG home page also features the new ONE &quot;Click Spot&quot;  and stars some of the biggest names in music and Hollywood,  including George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Tom Hanks, Jamie Foxx,  Cameron Diaz, Penelope Cruz, Gwen Stefani, Dave Matthews,  Coldplay, Sean &quot;P. Diddy&quot; Combs, 50 Cent and Bono.   In the spot,  each clicks their fingers to show that every three seconds, a  child dies of AIDS and extreme poverty-and that millions of  Americans have the power to come together as ONE and save lives  in Africa and the world's poorest countries.</p>
<p>   Today, over 1 billion people live on less than $1 a day, and  every day in Africa, HIV/AIDS kills 6,600 people, 8,500 people  are infected with the HIV virus and at least 1,400 newborn babies  are infected during childbirth. ONE is helping Americans raise  their voices as ONE against the emergency of AIDS and extreme  poverty, joining together to ask leaders to do more to save  millions of lives in the world's poorest countries. </p>
<p>   ABOUT ONE: THE CAMPAIGN TO MAKE POVERTY HISTORY: ONE  (www.one.org) is a new effort by Americans to rally Americans --  ONE by ONE -- to fight the emergency of global AIDS and extreme  poverty.  ONE is a coalition of 2 million people and over 70 of  the nation's leading relief, humanitarian and advocacy  organizations.
