<p>WATKINS GLEN, New York - November 2 - Instead of  eating a turkey this year, why not adopt one? That is the message  that Farm Sanctuary is spreading and word is catching on: More  than one thousand turkeys have been rescued though the  organization since 1986 and the annual Adopt-A-Turkey Project  continues to grow in popularity. This year, thousands of  compassionate citizens will &quot;adopt&quot; a turkey rescued by the  nation's leading farm animal protection organization.</p>
<p>   The Adopt-A-Turkey Project offers two ways for anyone to save  a turkey:</p>
<p>   1.) Sponsor &quot;adopt&quot; a turkey living at Farm Sanctuary's  Watkins Glen, N.Y., or Orland, Calif., shelters. For a one-time  adoption fee of $20, sponsors receive a color photograph of their  turkey, an adoption certificate and a year subscription to Farm  Sanctuary's quarterly newsletter. This sponsorship provides funds  for feed, bedding and veterinary care for the turkeys and helps  Farm Sanctuary encourage millions of people to celebrate a  compassionate Thanksgiving for all.</p>
<p>   2.) Home adopt and provide a safe, loving and permanent home  for two or more turkeys. Individuals interested in adopting  turkeys as companions must complete an adoption application. If  approved, adopters will be placed on Farm Sanctuary's Turkey  Express schedule.</p>
<p>   &quot;As consumers learn about the cruelties involved in raising  turkeys for Thanksgiving, more people are choosing compassionate  holiday alternatives,&quot; said Tricia Ritterbusch, communications  director at Farm Sanctuary. &quot;We encourage people to rethink  traditional holiday menus, opting instead for a delicious  cruelty-free Thanksgiving meal.&quot;</p>
<p>   Every year, nearly 300 million turkeys are raised and  slaughtered in the United States -- 45 million alone for  Thanksgiving. Most are slaughtered at only five months old, when  male turkeys (toms) weigh a massive 25 to 32 pounds and females  weigh 15 to 18 pounds. To meet consumer demand for white meat,  commercial turkeys have been bred to have abnormally large  breasts. As a result, the birds can not reproduce naturally and  the industry now relies on forced artificial insemination as the  sole means of reproduction. In addition, most factory-farmed  turkeys, comprising the vast majority of turkeys raised for  holiday dinners, have their beaks and toes amputated, because  they are allotted only three square-feet to live out their lives.</p>
