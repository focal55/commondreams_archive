<p>SAN FRANCISCO - December 18 - On Thursday, December 21, at 2 p.m., a federal judge in San Francisco will consider requests from media groups to unseal critical evidence in the Electronic Frontier Foundation's (EFF's) class-action lawsuit against AT&T.</p>

<p>EFF's suit accuses the telecom giant of collaborating with the National Security Agency (NSA) in illegal spying on millions of ordinary Americans. The sealed evidence includes a declaration by Mark Klein, a retired AT&T telecommunications technician, as well as several internal AT&T documents and portions of a declaration from EFF's expert witness. Some of the evidence was previously released in redacted form, while other evidence is still completely unavailable to the media and the public.</p>

<p>U.S. District Court Judge Vaughn Walker will also consider whether two state court lawsuits against AT&T and Verizon over NSA access to phone records, which were recently transferred to his courtroom, should be transferred back to state court.</p>

<p>WHAT: <br>
Hepting v. AT&T and other NSA telecommunications records lawsuits</p>

<p>WHEN: <br>
2 p.m. <br>
Thursday, December 21</p>

<p>WHERE: <br>
450 Golden Gate Ave., Courtroom 6 <br>
San Francisco, CA 94102</p>
