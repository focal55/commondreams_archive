<p>WASHINGTON - January 10 - Amid growing national concern over flaws with capital

punishment, the New Jersey Assembly Monday approved a one-year ban on

executions in the state and said it would study how the death penalty

is administered.

 

<p>If, as expected, the legislation is signed by New Jersey’s outgoing

governor by Monday, Jan. 16, New Jersey will become the first state

since executions resumed in the 1970s to enact legislation establishing 

a moratorium. Two other states – Illinois and Maryland – enacted

moratoriums as a result of executive orders but not as a result of

state legislative action.

 

<p>The bill passed Monday on a vote of 55 to 21 with two abstentions;

previously, it had passed the Senate on a strong bipartisan vote

of 30 to 6. NCADP helped its affiliate, New Jerseyans for Alternatives

to the Death Penalty, by mobilizing death penalty opponents in New

Jersey and urging them to contact their state senators.

 

<p>New Jersey’s action comes at a time when voters increasingly are

questioning whether innocent people are sentenced to death. Just

last month, the Houston Chronicle published an investigative series

strongly suggesting that a person executed in Texas, Ruben Cantu,

may well have been innocent. This week, DNA tests could show whether

Roger Keith Coleman of Virginia was innocent of the crime for which 

he was executed in 1992.

 

<p>“Across the country, people are becoming increasingly aware that the

death penalty risks executing the innocent and discriminates on the

basis of race, geography and whether one can afford a good lawyer,” 

said Diann Rust-Tierney, executive director of the National Coalition

to Abolish the Death Penalty. “New Jersey legislators are responding

to this growing awareness. No one wants an innocent person to 

spend even one day on death row, much less be executed.”

 

<p>Rust-Tierney noted that two other states, California and North Carolina,

have approved bills creating commissions that will study the death penalty.

She predicted that within the next two years a number of states will debate

abolition and moratorium bills, other death penalty reforms and bills

to examine capital punishment.
