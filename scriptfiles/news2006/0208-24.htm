<P>WASHINGTON - February 8 - America's fragile beaches and coastal waters are under growing congressional and administrative threats, including a renewed push to open up parts of Florida and Virginia’s coasts to destructive oil and gas drilling. Today the Bush administration released a 5-year offshore drilling plan today that would open up vast areas of the Lease 181 area in the Gulf of Mexico and anticipates opening areas off Virginia's coast and in Alaska's Bristol Bay that are currently protected by both &nbsp;Congressional moratoria and presidential deferrals. Senators Bill Nelson (D-FL) and Mel Martinez (R-FL) last week introduced legislation that would head off these threats by providing permanent protection for Florida’s coasts and extended protection for the remaining moratoria areas.<BR>
<br>
“Instead of undermining protections that America’s coasts have long enjoyed, the Sierra Club is urging Congress and the administration to move more in the direction of Senators Nelson and Martinez,” said Melinda Pierce, Sierra Club Offshore Drilling Specialist. “It’s time to shift the national debate on offshore drilling closer to securing permanent protection for America’s fragile coasts.”<BR>
<br>
The Sierra Club announced official support for the Nelson-Martinez bill today.<BR>The Minerals Management Service (MMS) today released its 5-year Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) planning document that details future leasing and development in areas of the Gulf as well as Alaska and the mid-Atlantic coast. The plan moves to aggressively lease vast new areas in 21 proposed lease sales. In addition, the plan assumes that areas off the Virginia coast would be available for development in the year 2011. They are anticipating that the Virginia state legislature would move to opt out of the&nbsp;current federal moratoria and that the President would nullify the present deferral which extends until 2012. Similarly, the document contemplates lifting the current presidential deferrals protecting Bristol Bay in Alaska.<BR>
<br>
Also today Senator Pete Domenici (R-NM) and others introduced their damaging plan for the development of the central and eastern Gulf of Mexico. The bill would open up nearly 4 million acres to oil and gas development. As chair of the Senate Energy Committee, he is expected to move that bill quickly to the floor for full Senate consideration.<BR>
<br>
“It is unfortunate that just a week after President Bush admitted the country is addicted to oil, his administration is moving to open up more of our treasured coasts to destructive drilling. So much for kicking the habit,” said Pierce. “We are equally disappointed to see Senator Domenici and others advocate legislation that further entrenches our dependence on drilling some of the most sensitive areas.”<BR>
<br>
In the face of these aggressive drilling proposals, Senators Nelson Martinez have introduced a bill that:<BR>
<br>
-- extends extend federal OCS moratoria on new oil and gas drilling until at least &nbsp;2020 -- provides permanent protection for Florida’s coasts and retires the 99 active leases in the Eastern Gulf<BR>
<br>
-- acknowledges that seismic testing is harmful to the environment and would ban the practice in the Florida exclusionary zone and it other moratoria areas<BR>
<br>
-- includes a Sense of the Senate that no new leasing shall take place in the Great Lakes.<BR>
<br>
In addition, the Sierra Club strongly supports securing revenues that would be used to repair coastal damage directly and indirectly caused by the oil and gas industry operations in the Gulf. &nbsp;The funds should be used for critically needed restoration of natural coastal systems as the first line of defense for future hurricanes.<BR>
<br>
“As we move forward, we hope that in addition to seeking permanent protection for our coasts, Congress will also make critical strides on the clean energy front, embracing energy efficiency, clean renewable sources of energy and making cars go farther on a gallon of gas,” said Pierce. “In the end, we don't need to sacrifice our beaches and coastal waters to meet America's energy needs.”
