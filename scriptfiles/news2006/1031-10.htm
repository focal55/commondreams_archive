<p>WASHINGTON - October 31 - The Campaign for  America's Future released a print ad today outlining how Rep.  Charles Taylor (R-N.C.) took contributions from corporate  interests and then voted to protect those special interests at  the cost of working families. The ad is part of a wide-ranging  public education campaign launched last week with a six-figure  media price tag. The campaign, which features print ads, direct  mailings, websites and pre-recorded phone messages, also focuses  on Reps. Don Sherwood (R-Pa.), Curt Weldon (R-Pa.), Rob Simmons  (R-Conn.), Heather Wilson (R-N.M.), Deborah Pryce (R-Ohio) and  Sen. Mike DeWine (R-Ohio).</p>
<p>   The campaign centers on how these members took campaign  contributions and free TV spots from the pharmaceutical and  insurance industries and then voted for the costly and confusing  Medicare Part D prescription drug plan. While the Veterans  Administration negotiates for lower drug prices, legislation  creating Part D expressly prohibits the government from  negotiating lower drug prices for seniors and the disabled. Part  D also includes a large gap in coverage, known as the &quot;donut  hole,&quot; for individuals who have more than $2,250 in drug costs  each year.   </p>
<p>   &quot;These members of Congress supported legislation giving  handouts to big campaign contributors at the expense of everyday  Americans,&quot; said Campaign for America's Future co-director Roger  Hickey. &quot;The campaign we're running highlights how these  lawmakers stuck seniors with higher prescription drug prices  while collecting large campaign contributions from the insurance  and pharmaceutical companies who benefited from their  legislation.&quot;  </p>
<p>   The Campaign for America's Future launched the first wave of  ads, direct mailings, recorded telephone messages and websites  last week, taking aim at Rep. Deborah Pryce (R-Ohio) and Sen.  Mike DeWine (R-Ohio).  The print and online ads describe the  members of Congress as voting &quot;to protect drug companies instead  of seniors.&quot;  </p>
<p>   The Campaign for America's Future has also set up websites to  display each representative's record. For example, at  <a href="http://releases.usnewswire.com/redir.asp?ReleaseID=75378&Link=http://www.ourfuture.org/taylor">http://www.ourfuture.org/taylor</a> citizens can learn how Rep.  Taylor voted on key legislation and the special interest  contributions that may have influenced these votes.
