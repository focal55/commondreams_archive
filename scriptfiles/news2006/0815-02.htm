<p>WASHINGTON - August 15 - Former CIA officer  Valerie Plame Wilson and her husband former Ambassador Joseph  Wilson announced today that they have engaged the non-profit,  public interest organization Citizens for Responsibility and  Ethics in Washington (CREW) as successor counsel and Joseph  Cotchett and Frank Pitre with the law firm of Cotchett, Pitre,  Simon &amp; McCarthy as trial counsel in their case against Vice  President Dick Cheney, his former Chief of Staff I. Lewis  &quot;Scooter&quot; Libby, top Presidential advisor Karl Rove and other  unnamed current and former administration officials. Erwin  Chemerinsky, professor at Duke University School of Law, will  continue to serve in the case as co-counsel. </p>
<p>   The Wilsons have filed a sweeping federal civil lawsuit  against the defendants for their involvement in intentionally  exposing Valerie Wilson's classified CIA status to reporters in  order to punish and seek revenge against Joseph Wilson for  publicly disputing statements made by President Bush in his 2003  State of the Union address justifying the war in Iraq. </p>
<p>   During this next phase of the litigation, the Wilsons will  work closely with their new legal counsel in their efforts to  uncover the truth surrounding the leak, to ensure all relevant  public officials are held accountable for their actions and to  deter similar offenses from being committed in the future.
