<p>WASHINGTON - January 31 - <i>Social Policy</i> magazine, a progressive quarterly journal with 30+ years publishing history, releases special feature on Organizing Wal-Mart.  

 

<p>The issue features work from all the key players in the movement against the superstore, including Paul Blank, Director of Wake-upWal-Mart.com, Jason Judd and Marisa Levine-Sabol of AFL-CIO’s Wal-Mart Campaign, and Celinda Lake, leading pollster and author of What Women Really Want: How American Women Are Quietly Erasing Political, Racial, Class, and Religious Lines to Change the Way We Live.  

 

<p>Wade Rathke, Editor-in-Chief and Publisher of Social Policy says “this feature is going to be a must in the toolbox of any one looking at Wal-Mart seriously and what it takes to make the company a corporate citizen rather than just a consumer giant.”

 

<p>Following the success of campaigns such as those launched by Wake-upWal-Mart.com, Wal-Mart Watch, and Brave New Films’ premiere week of Wal-Mart: The High Cost of Low Price, this issue comes at a time when organizers and activists are seeking low-term tools to keep consistent pressure on the Bentonville behemoth, with strategies and analysis from site fights to uncovering Wal-Mart’s hidden sourcing factories

<p><i>Social Policy</i> is a quarterly journal with 30+ years of publishing progressive exchange for the grassroots academic and activist community, now published jointly by the American Institute for Social Justice (AISJ) and The ACORN Institute.
