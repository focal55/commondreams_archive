<p>WASHINGTON  - August 9 - Supporters of the Cook County referendum on the November  ballot to allow resident to show their support for an assault  weapons ban will discuss the referendum plans Thursday, Aug. 10  at 10 AM.
<p>   They'll meet at the Cook County Morgue, 2121 West Harrison  Street, Chicago, IL.</p>

<p>   Scheduled attendees include Cook County Commissioner Larry  Suffredin and other Cook County Commissioners; Siretha Woods and  Denise Reed, the mothers of young Englewood assault weapons  victims; Tom Dart, Candidate for Sheriff Cook County; State  Representative Edward Acevedo; Jennifer Bishop, the State  Director for the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence; and  others.</p>
<p>   The referendum on the Cook County ballot in November will read  &quot;For the health and safety of children and the entire community,  shall the State of Illinois enact a comprehensive ban on the  manufacture, sale, delivery and possession of military-style  assault weapons and .50 caliber rifles?&quot;</p>
<p>   &quot;None of us ever want to visit the morgue,&quot; Bishop said.   &quot;It's not a place anyone wants to be - and if we had fewer  assault weapons on our streets, fewer of us would ever have to go  there.&quot;
