<p>BRUSSELS - June 8 - As NATO Defence Ministers prepare for today’s high level meeting on the future of the organisation,  twenty four Greenpeace activists, from Belgium, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Turkey and the UK, were arrested this morning after staging a protest at NATO’s Brussels Headquarters. The peace activists were demanding  the removal of the 480 US owned and controlled nuclear weapons from Europe, located in the six countries under the NATO nuclear sharing agreement. 

 

<p>At 6am this morning, a Greenpeace truck carrying a full size replica of a US B61 nuclear bomb blocked the entrance to NATO with activists bearing banners saying “Nukes out of NATO”. More activists entered the site draping banners over the  NATO symbol statue also calling for “Nukes out of NATO”. While others dropped a 2 meter square banner from the main building which repeated the message. 

 

<p>Sixteen years after the end of the cold war, 480[1] US Nuclear weapons remain in Europe, spread across Germany, Belgium, Italy, the Netherlands, Turkey and the UK under NATO agreements. Each has a destructive capacity of up to ten times that of the bomb that  destroyed Hiroshima, and have a combined power capable of wiping Europe off the map. Last week Greenpeace released opinion polls showing that a large majority of Europeans living in NATO US nuclear weapons host countries want to live in a nuclear weapons free Europe. [2]

 

<p>“Defence Ministers should today act on the fact that the people in NATO countries hosting US nuclear weapons want a nuclear weapons free Europe. Now is the time to make NATO in the 21st century free of 20th century nuclear weapons and policies,” said Greenpeace Disarmament Campaigner Donna Mattfield.

 

<p>Last week a report released by the Commission on Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMDC) chaired by Hans Blix included two recommendations that explicitly called for r the 480 US nuclear weapons to be removed to US soil. [3] The WMDC report provides great detail on the dangers of US nuclear weapons. The Commission also explains how these weapons impede international efforts to negotiate further nuclear reductions with Russia. 

 

<p>The governments of NATO countries have a direct role in shaping the organisation’s policy and can insist that these weapons be removed.  The US has been told to take their weapons home several times before: Canada, Greece, Denmark (Greenland) and Iceland are all now free of US nuclear bombs. [4] 

 

<p>“With all the debate over Iran’s nuclear intentions, countries must accept their own responsibility and role in de-escalating nuclear tensions in the Middle East. By removing US NATO nuclear weapons, European leaders have the opportunity to begin to address the concerns of their citizens, to strengthen the position of Europe in negotiations with the Middle East and Russia and take a real step towards achieving a nuclear  free,  peaceful future” concluded Mattfield.

<p>[2] Full poll results: http://www.greenpeace.org/international/press/reports/nuclear-weapons-in-europe-survey

<p>[3] WMDC RECOMMENDATION 21: “Russia and the United States should proceed to implement the commitments they made in 1991 to eliminate specific types of non-strategic nuclear weapons, such as demolition munitions, artillery shells and warheads for short-range ballistic missiles. They should agree to withdraw all non-strategic nuclear weapons to central storage on national territory, pending their eventual elimination. The two countries should reinforce their 1991 unilateral reduction commitments by developing arrangements to ensure verification, transparency and irreversibility.”

<p>WMDC RECOMMENDATION 22: “Every state that possesses nuclear weapons should make a commitment not to deploy any nuclear weapon, of any type, on foreign soil.”
