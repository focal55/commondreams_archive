<p>WASHINGTON - May 10 - Today more than 200  scholars, academics, commentators, and former U.S. government  officials issued a strong condemnation of the threat of U.S.  military action against Iran and called on the Bush  administration to enter into face-to-face negotiations with the  government in Tehran. </p>
<p>   In a letter sent to the White House Tuesday evening, the group  urges diplomacy to resolve concerns over the development of  nuclear materials that have magnified tensions between Iran and  the U.S. and global community. </p>

<p>   &quot;As the International Atomic Energy Agency has found no  evidence of research or diversion of materials toward atomic  weapons in Iran, concerns about future dual use of nuclear  technology ought to be addressed in face to face negotiations,&quot;  write the signatories and supporters, a diverse group of well  respected Middle East experts from around the world as well as  former U.S. officials and journalists. The letter warns that the  likely &quot;catastrophic regional and global consequences of  escalating this crisis will not serve the interests of the United  States, the course of democratic development in Iran, or the  cause of global peace.&quot; </p>
<p>   Among the signatories are Professors Juan Cole, Charles  Butterworth, Richard Falk, Ervand Abrahamian, Ahmad Sadri, and  Noam Chomsky. On Wednesday, several signatories of the letter  held a press conference in Washington to answer questions about  their position. &quot;We started the letter out of a sense of  frustration that the experts in the field were not being  consulted as the U.S. develops policy toward Iran,&quot; explained Professor Ahmad Sadri, who coordinated the project. &quot;This is the  same mistake the U.S. government made before going to Iraq. We're  saying don't do that again.&quot; </p>
<p>   The Friends Committee on National Legislation (FCNL), which  hosted the press conference, is a non-partisan Quaker lobby in  the public interest that has worked for more than 60 years to  support peaceful alternatives to war and other deadly conflicts  and promote nuclear disarmament. FCNL represents 26 Yearly  Meetings of the Religious Society of Friends (called Quakers).  FCNL speaks for itself and like-minded individuals. </p>
