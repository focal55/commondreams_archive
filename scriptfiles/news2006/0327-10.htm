<p> NEW YORK - March 27 - The Center for Justice &amp;  Democracy (CJ&amp;D) today condemned the U.S. Chamber of Commerce's  fifth annual state liability rankings report for its inexplicable  targeting for criticism every state in the Hurricane ravaged Gulf  Coast region, suggesting that these states are bad for  businesses.  </p>
<p>   The report, which, according to CJ&amp;D, is based on nothing more  than the views of corporate lawyers who defend corporate  wrongdoers, ranks the hardest-hit Gulf Region states among the  bottom 10 states: Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Texas.  As  one illustration of how completely erroneous such &quot;rankings&quot; are,  the same day the Chamber released its report, an economic survey  by Chicago-based Pollina Corporate Real Estate Inc., evaluating  businesses based on 26 factors, put Alabama as no. 5 in the  nation for business friendliness.</p>
<p>   &quot;At a time when the rest of the country is pulling for these  states to recover from devastating hurricanes, the U.S. Chamber  of Commerce has apparently decided this is a good time to trash  them with false information, adding to the misery of their  citizens and wreaking further havoc on their business  communities,&quot; said Joanne Doroshow, executive director of the  Center for Justice &amp; Democracy.  &quot;The U.S. Chamber of Commerce  needs to get back to its mission of helping promote good  businesses and stop attacking the very states and communities it  should be helping.&quot; </p>
<p>   CJ&amp;D also condemned the Chamber for focusing attacks on  several other states including Wisconsin, Illinois, and West  Virginia, all of which are doing well or better than they have in  recent years in terms of business climate.
