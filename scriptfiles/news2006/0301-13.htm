<p>LOS ANGELES – March 1 - As former New York City Mayor, Rudy Giuliani, begins to move ahead as the favored presidential candidate with Republican voters as indicated in a recent poll by WNBC/Marist, Director Kevin Keating’s shocking doc, “Giuliani Time,” will premiere in New York at the Landmark Sunshine on May 12, 2006, and widen thereafter.

<p>The documentary, which had a successful run at the Rotterdam and Vancouver International Film Festivals, examines TIME Magazine’s 2001 “Person of the Year”, former Mayor Rudy Giuliani, his policies and his so-called turnaround of New York City.  Utilizing a range of personalities and experts from high-level city officials to community activists, lawyers and politicians, Keating’s film analyzes Giuliani’s personal background, his record and the severe methods he employed to enforce the “Quality of Life” and “Zero Tolerance” campaigns in New York City.  

<p>The film’s carefully developed revelations are in direct contrast to the image portrayed by the <a href="http://www.draftrudygiuliani.com">Draft Rudy Giuliani for President Campaign</a> of Giuliani as the man “who held the city of New York together and helped strengthen America's resolve” as well as the mayor who “returned accountability to city government and improved the quality of life for all New Yorkers.  Under Mr. Giuliani's leadership, New York City became the best-known example of the resurgence of urban America.”

<p>“It’s in the bloodstream of New Yorkers,” says Wayne Barrett, Senior Editor of the Village Voice who was interviewed in the film. “And, apparently it is now even in the bloodstream of Americans, this mythology that Rudy Giuliani single handedly… superhero…conquered crime in New York City.”  “Giuliani Time” makes a significant contribution to the historical record by disclosing disturbing facts about Giuliani’s history that conscientious voters from across the political spectrum should take into consideration.

<p>The film began as an information video in 1998 when a prominent constitutional lawyer approached Keating’s video production company, K Video Productions.  He was concerned about the Giuliani administration’s restrictions on free speech and its fractious relationship with the media.  “The project started as a short film to explore the dynamics and tensions in issues around the First Amendment,” says Keating. “But as would be the case repeatedly over the following years, dramatic events unfolded around us, necessitating the need to render a comprehensive document of the time.”  The film was made over five years with three hundred hours of footage shot and three hundred hours of archival footage reviewed to create the feature length “Giuliani Time.”

<p>Variety Magazine calls the film a “top-notch” and “technically flawless” documentary.

<p>Cinema Libre Studio, the independent studio known for distributing socially conscious titles, will handle distribution.  “It is crucial that Americans are given access to as much factual information about their political leaders as possible in order to vote intelligently,” says Richard Castro, Head of Theatrical Distribution at Cinema Libre Studio.  “This film reveals a side of Rudolph Giuliani that most of us have been unaware of or afraid to publicly address.”

<p>The film will open in New York on May 12th and play in select theatres across the country.
