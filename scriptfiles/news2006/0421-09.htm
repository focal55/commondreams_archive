<p>NASHVILLE - April 21 - The American Civil Liberties Union today hailed a federal appeals 
court decision delaying Tennessee&#8217;s production of an anti-choice specialty 
license plate while the organization seeks U.S. Supreme Court review of a ruling 
upholding the plate as constitutional.
<P>&#8220;Tennessee must ensure that all residents can express their views equally,&#8221; 
said Hedy Weinberg, Executive Director of the ACLU of Tennessee.&nbsp; &#8220;The 
state cannot be in the business of limiting some speech while allowing other 
speech.&#8221;</P>
<P>The legislature twice rejected an amendment that would have authorized a 
&#8220;Pro-Choice&#8221; specialty plate.&nbsp; The law in question makes a &#8220;Choose Life&#8221; 
license plate available to motorists for an annual fee of $35 over and above the 
basic cost of registering a car in the state.&nbsp; Fifty percent of all funds 
raised, after expenses, will go to a private anti-choice organization called New 
Life Resources.</P>
<P>In March, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled against the ACLU and ruled 
that the anti-choice plate did not violate free speech rights.&nbsp; Earlier 
this month, the ACLU announced that it would appeal that decision to the U.S. 
Supreme Court and also asked the federal appeals court to postpone Tennessee&#8217;s 
production of the plate while the appeal is under 
consideration.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>&#8220;We are pleased that the court prevented the production of the plate while 
the case is under review,&#8221; said Brigitte Amiri, a Staff Attorney with the ACLU 
Reproductive Freedom Project. &#8220;We are hopeful that the Supreme Court will agree 
with our position that by only allowing an anti-choice plate, Tennessee has 
effectively silenced a viewpoint it disagrees with.&#8221; </P>
<P>Plaintiffs in the case include the ACLU of Tennessee, Planned Parenthood of 
Middle and East Tennessee, Inc., and three individuals.&nbsp; Lawyers on the 
case include Julie Sternberg, Carrie Flaxman, and Amiri with the ACLU 
Reproductive Freedom Project; Roger Evans of Planned Parenthood Federation of 
America; and Susan L. Kay, the ACLU of Tennessee Legal Committee Chair.</P>
<P>Today&#8217;s case is <EM>ACLU of Tennessee v. Bredesen</EM>, #03-1046.&nbsp; To learn more
