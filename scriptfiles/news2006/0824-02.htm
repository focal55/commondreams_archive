<p>NEW YORK - August 24 - While Planned Parenthood  of New York City (PPNYC) today welcomed the decision by the U.S.  Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to approve over-the-counter  status for Plan B emergency contraception (EC) for women 18 and  older, PPNYC expressed dismay at the scientifically baseless  restrictions that deny teenagers over-the-counter access to the  safe, effective method of backup birth control. </p>
<p>   Traci Perry, vice-president of Public Affairs for PPNYC, said,  &quot;After over 550 days of needless delay, we are pleased that the  FDA finally ended its foot-dragging on this issue and approved  Plan B for OTC access for women 18 and older. We remain, however,  troubled by the scientifically baseless restriction imposed on  teenagers. New York City has one of the highest rates of teen  pregnancy in the country -- anything that makes it harder for  teenagers to avoid unintended pregnancy is bad medicine and bad  public policy.&quot;</p>
<p>   Research shows that over-the-counter access to emergency  contraception does not increase or encourage sexual activity  among teens, and better access to proven prevention methods like  accurate sex education and emergency birth control are the best  ways to reduce the alarming rate of teen pregnancy in this  country. Planned Parenthood will continue to do all it can to  educate women of all ages about EC and help them access emergency  contraception.</p>
<p>   EC lowers the risk of pregnancy when started within 120 hours  of unprotected intercourse. The sooner EC is administered after  unprotected intercourse, the better it works, making timely  access critically important. Studies show that women do not use  EC as a regular method of birth control.</p>
