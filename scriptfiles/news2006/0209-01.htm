<p>WASHINGTON - February 9 - As Group of 8 (G-8) Finance Ministers prepare to meet this
weekend in Moscow with implementation of last year&#8217;s impoverished
country debt cancellation deal, energy security, and avian flu on their
agenda, Jubilee USA Network Thursday urged US Treasury Secretary John
Snow and other ministers present to address deadly delays to debt
cancellation proposed by the World Bank. <br>

&nbsp;<br>
<span style="font-weight;">&#8220;The credibility of G-8 Finance
Ministers is at stake this weekend in Moscow. They talked about a deal
to cancel debts of up to 38 countries last summer, but under the
proposal currently being considered by the World Bank, fewer than half
of these nations will see any relief two full years after the
agreement, and they&#8217;ll have to foot the bill,&#8221;</span> said Debayani
Kar, spokesperson for Jubilee USA Network. <span
 style="font-weight: ">&#8220;Impoverished people will pay the costs of
this delay in lost lives, denied health care, and education. G-8
ministers meeting this weekend must put an end to these deadly delays,&#8221;</span>
she said.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
The World Bank Executive Board will meet in February and March to
implement&nbsp; debt cancellation for those impoverished countries made
eligible under the terms of the July 2005 G-8 debt agreement, now
called the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI). This follows the
IMF Board&#8217;s approval of debt cancellation for 19 impoverished countries
this past December. There are three key issues that G-8 Ministers,
representing leading shareholders at the World Bank, must address: <br>
<ul>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">The Bank is proposing what
amounts to a 15-month delay for any additional countries to receive
cancellation beyond an initial 17 nations.</span> This new approach
will mean that countries that already qualify for the debt relief
program &#8211; such as Burundi, Cameroon, Guinea, Malawi, and Sierra Leone,
many of which are heavily burdened by HIV/AIDS &#8211; will now have to wait
until July 2007 at the earliest for debt cancellation &#8211; a full two
years after the G-8 summit was held in Gleneagles. </li>

  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">While IMF debt cancellation
provided cancellation of all debts through end-2004, the World Bank
proposal would only cover debts until end-2003.</span> For nations like
Cameroon and Malawi, combined with the delays they face, this will mean
even after &#8220;100% debt cancellation&#8221; to the World Bank, they will owe
millions in debts to the World Bank between 2004 and 2007. </li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Far too few countries get debt
cancellation under the current program.</span> In April, the World Bank
proposes to add 4 new countries to the HIPC Initiative &#8211; Haiti,
Eritrea, Kyrgyz Republic, and Nepal. But these nations &#8211; including
Haiti, the Western Hemisphere&#8217;s poorest nation &#8211; will face interminable
delays and in the case of Haiti will not see actual debt cancellation
until December 2009 because of the harmful economic conditions attached
to qualification for debt relief. Moreover, the fact that the World
Bank proposes to add only 4 nations, again demonstrates the utter
inadequacy of the HIPC framework. The UK government and leading
international charities have identified at least 60-70 countries that
would need 100% debt cancellation to meet the Millennium Development
Goals and many more nations require cancellation of odious and
illegitimate debts. The HIPC approach is clearly inadequate. </li>

</ul>
At the G-8 Ministers meeting, debt will be discussed alongside a focus
on energy security. Jubilee USA underscores the connection between
increased oil production in impoverished countries and increased debt
burdens resulting from new loans for production, which fuels climate
change and local environmental degradation. Jubilee USA intends to
continue to highlight the links between debt, oil, poverty, and climate
change, and the need for a shift to renewable, clean energy in the
coming months.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<span style="font-weight;">&#8220;Debt relief and energy security are
both fundamentally threatened by rising oil prices and our ongoing
addiction to oil. Freedom from debt ultimately means freedom from oil,&#8221;</span> said Steve Kretzmann, Executive Director of Oil Change International, a
member organization of Jubilee USA Network. <!-- #EndEditable -->
