<p>WASHINGTON - January 26 - On Monday, ExxonMobil is expected to announce a record-breaking
      annual profit of roughly $32 billion for 2005- the largest profit in
      the history of corporate America.  But despite record profits, the
      world's largest oil company has yet to pay a single penny in the
      damages they owe to the Alaskan fishermen whose livelihoods were
      destroyed by the 1989 Valdez oil spill.


<p>  On January 27th, Cordova's fisherman will come to San Francisco to
      demand that the company pays its fair share. The 9th U.S. Circuit
      Court of Appeals will hear oral arguments about whether the 30,000
      plaintiffs affected by the spill will get the $4.5 billion in
      punitive damages that was awarded to them-but never paid. Around 3000
      plaintiffs have died while waiting sixteen years for ExxonMobil to
      pay punitive damages which amount to small change for the company.

<p>  The emotional story of the Prince William Sound fishermen whose lives
      Exxon changed forever will be told February 9 at 8:30 PM EST/PST in
      the newest episode of Sierra Club Chronicles on <a href="http://www.worldlinktv.org/">Link TV</a>.  "The Day
      the Water Died" describes the largest oil tanker spill in American
      history - and how Exxon falsely promised they would pay for the
      damage.  Sixteen years later, local communities are still waiting for
      their lives to become "whole" again.  The full episode will be
      available for viewing and download for iPods at
<a href="http://www.sierraclubtv.org/">http://www.sierraclubtv.org/</a>
<p> B-roll of the fishermen reacting to the lawsuit and the town/port of
      Cordova is available at <a href="http://www.sierraclubtv.org/pressroom/">http://www.sierraclubtv.org/pressroom/</a>.
      Segments of "The Day the Water Died" can also be used in conjunction
      with promotion of the episode.  Please call for hard copies.
