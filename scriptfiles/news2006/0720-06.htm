<p>CHICAGO - July 20 - Amnesty International USA Midwest Regional Director Dori Dinsmore released the following statement today in response to special prosecutor Edward Egan's report on allegations of police abuse in Chicago in the 1970s and 1980s: 

<p>"Amnesty International welcomes the release of the special prosecutor's report -- but it's truly unfortunate that these allegations were not investigated more promptly. 

<p>Amnesty International issued a report in 1990 about police torture in Chicago; we received reports at the time that police from the Area 2 police station systematically tortured African American detainees between 1972 and 1986. In December 1990, Amnesty International wrote to both the Cook County States Attorney and to the US Attorney for the Northern District of Illinois, asking them to investigate the allegations. 

<p>Despite the allegations of torture, the authorities failed to act. The statute of limitations should not be allowed to block prosecution of crimes that are as grave as torture. The state of Illinois should amend its law so that there is no statute of limitations for cases of torture."
