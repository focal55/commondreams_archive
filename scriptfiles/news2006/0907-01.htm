<p>WASHINGTON - September 7 - Americans United for Separation of Church and State today blasted the House Judiciary Committee&#8217;s approval of a bill that would make it more difficult for Americans to challenge church-state violations in court.
<P>The so-called &#8220;Public Expression of Religion Act&#8221; targets those who stand up to church-state infringements by government officials. The measure, H.R. 2679, denies legal fees and out-of-pocket expenses to plaintiffs who win lawsuits under the First Amendment&#8217;s Establishment Clause, which bans the government from promoting religion. </P>
<P>The committee passed the bill on a voice vote today, and it is now headed to the House floor.</P>
<P>&#8220;It&#8217;s remarkable to me that at a time when our country faces so many serious issues, the Judiciary Committee has nothing better to do than pander to the Religious Right with this mean-spirited bill,&#8221; said the Rev. Barry W. Lynn, executive director of Americans United. &#8220;It&#8217;s another sad example of how this &#8216;do-nothing Congress&#8217; earned its name.&#8221;&nbsp; </P>
<P>Lynn charged that the bill erodes individual rights. Under current law, Americans whose church-state rights have been violated by the government are free to file lawsuits. If the lawsuits are successful, the law allows for the recovery of reasonable attorneys&#8217; fees and out-of-pocket expenses from the government. If H.R. 2679 were to become law, however, that will no longer be the case.</P>
<P>The measure is being touted by Religious Right groups as a way to discourage lawsuits challenging religious displays on public property.&nbsp;But, in fact, it is much broader than that and would deny reimbursement in conflicts ranging from government-sponsored religion in public schools to taxpayer funding for religious schools and other ministries.</P>
<P>Lynn said if the bill passes, it will set a precedent for Congress to deny attorneys&#8217; fees in other types of litigation. Currently, attorneys&#8217; fees are recoverable in a wide range of successful cases against the government involving constitutional and civil rights violations.</P>
<P>&#8220;This bill is nothing more than an attempt to scare people away from having their day in court,&#8221; Lynn said. &#8220;The House Judiciary Committee should be ashamed of itself for passing such a blatantly un-American scheme.&#8221; </P>
<P>Several national organizations that support civil rights and civil liberties have joined forces to oppose the measure.</P>
<P id=aboutau>Americans United is a religious liberty watchdog group based in Washington, D.C. Founded in 1947, the organization educates Americans about the importance of church-state separation in safeguarding religious freedom.</P>
