<p>NEW YORK - May 9 - Gourmet vegan cuisine takes  center stage on Saturday, May 20, 2006 as a host of stars join  Farm Sanctuary in New York City when the nation's leading farm  animal shelter and advocacy organization celebrates its 20th  anniversary at the 2006 Gala for Farm Animals. The event, co- chaired by long-time animal advocates Daryl Hannah and Heather  Mills-McCartney, brings together celebrity supporters, key  legislators and animal advocates to fete farm animals and those  working to protect these animals from suffering.</p>
<p>   The chefs at Cipriani Wall Street, accompanied by Jorge Pineda  and Angel Ramos from Candle Cafe and Candle 79, will prepare a  three-course gourmet vegan dinner while guests enjoy a celebrity- filled reception and a farm animal-inspired auction. Revered  animal activist and devotee of Candle Cafe and Candle 79, Heather  Mills-McCartney will present the New York institution with the  Leader in Compassionate Living Award for the restaurant's vision,  talent and commitment to farm animal welfare and delicious vegan  food. </p>
<p>   Gene Bauston, president and co-founder of Farm Sanctuary added  his support to Candle's award, &quot;Farm Sanctuary encourages  consumers to adopt a plant-based diet, and Candle Cafe makes it  possible. Their restaurants are leading a powerful movement in  New York City, and beyond, toward a more compassionate way of  living.&quot; </p>
<p>   Long-standing members of Farm Sanctuary, Candle Cafe and  Candle 79 founders Joy Pierson and Bart Potenza have played an  instrumental role in Farm Sanctuary's black-tie Galas since 2001,  when Joy served on the planning committee, providing expertise in  gourmet vegan cooking to chefs at the Plaza Hotel in New York and  the Beverly Hills Hotel in California. Then-Plaza Hotel Chef Mark  Felix was so inspired by his introduction to vegan cuisine and  Joy's coaching that he pledged not to serve cruel veal anymore  and went on to become a vegan culinary expert himself, and is  working on a vegan cooking show for television. </p>
<p>   At Cipriani Wall Street, hors d'oeuvres include curried seitan  satay skewers with mango chutney, baby artichokes a la Romana,  eggplant caviar rolatini, braised radicchio risotto, endive leaf  with avocado salad, assorted bruschetta, rosemary focaccia, vegan  sushi and Zucchini a la Cipriani. The gourmet three-course meal  will begin with handmade organic ravioli filled with eggplant  zucchini and seasonal herbs, finished with a light pomodoro  sauce. The main course consists of seitan marsalla with bundles  of haricot verts, tied with carrot ribbon and served with grilled  white polenta. An alternate main course of artichoke risotto will  be on offer, as well.  Desserts include a chocolate brownie with  pistachio ice cream, an apple tart with vanilla soy ice cream,  and vegan petit fours.</p>
<p>   After dinner treats include hand-crafted Soy Gelato and Fruit  Sorbetto donated by Blackwell's Organic. Committed to delicious  desserts that are &quot;better for your body, your soul and the  planet,&quot; Blackwell's Organic desserts are made only with organic,  fair-trade ingredients. Candle Cafe and Candle 79 will also host  a tasting booth filled with signature menu items.  In addition,  independent chef Laura Dardi will provide additional sweets  including coconut tapioca pudding in crispy filo cups with a  tropical fruit salsa, chocolate ganache cake with rasberry sauce  and vanilla bean creme anglaise, and citrus tarts in a short  bread crust with fresh berries and mint.</p>
<p>   Over 25 celebrities will be in attendance including David  Boreanaz, Dave Foley, Mariel Hemingway, Swoosie Kurtz, Moby, Eric  Roberts, Alicia Silverstone, Paul Sorvino, Loretta Swit, Debra  Wilson, and many more.
