<P>CONCORD, New Hampshire - February 8 - On Tuesday, February 7, six New Hampshire 
citizens were found guilty of criminal trespass for a sit-in at Senator 
Judd Gregg’s Concord office on June 2, 2005.  The six defendants were 
given a one-year suspended sentence of $200 and were called “people of 
conscience” by the presiding judge, Judge Sullivan.

<P>"We are pleased that our concern regarding Senator Gregg's 
continuing refusal to to meet with NH citizens about the Iraq war 
received a public hearing," said Don Booth, one of the defendants.

<P>The group was arrested on June 2 at Senator Judd Gregg’s office after 
having made approximately a dozen requests for a meeting and collecting 
hundreds of signatures in support of a meeting to discuss the Iraq war.

<P>During the trial, the judge heard an account of the long process by 
which citizens had attempted to secure a meeting with the Senator.  The 
efforts began on April 12, when a letter requesting a public meeting 
was delivered to the Senator’s offices in Washington, DC.  Two 
subsequent formal appeals were made, along with a nearly daily presence 
at the Senator’s Concord offices during May, 2005.  On May 6, citizens 
had a “read-in” at the Senator’s office at which they read the names of 
Iraqi and U.S. casualties.  They left the offices at 5pm without 
incident.

<P>On June 2, the six citizens decided to stay at the Senator’s offices at 
closing.  “We felt a tremendous sense of urgency that day,” says Eileen 
Reardon, one of the defendants.  “The Senator had been non-responsive 
to dialogue about the Iraq war for a month and a half, despite our 
respectful and repeated attempts. U.S. and Iraqi casualties were 
continuing to mount. We were compelled to wait to hear from the 
Senator.”

<P>While the prosecutor tried to refer to the defendants as “protesters,” 
their lawyer, Nick Brodich, closed by emphasizing that they had tried 
repeatedly to secure a meeting the Senator.  “The real issue,” says 
Anne Miller, one of the defendants and director of New Hampshire Peace 
Action, “is one of democracy as well as war. What recourse do citizens 
have when their elected representatives refuse to enter into discourse 
about crucial issues that affect us all?  What could be more important 
than having a robust dialogue about a war that has cost the state of 
New Hampshire over a billion taxpayer dollars, and 2,250 American 
lives?”

<P>Eileen Reardon of Keene, Anne Miller of Concord, Jessica Ellis of 
Belmont, Mary Lee Sargent of Bow, Lynn Chong of Sanbornton and Don 
Booth of Concord plan to resume their request for a meeting with the 
Senator.  Next month, eight more citizens will stand trial for the same 
offense from arrests at Senator Gregg’s Concord offices in December, 
2005.

<P>To date, over $236 billion has been spent on the war and 2,250 U.S. 
soldiers have been killed in Iraq.
