<p>SAN FRANCISCO - November 20 - Just as the holiday  season gets ready to kick into high gear, Consumers Union is  warning shoppers about the increasing number of credit card traps  that can trip up consumers and lead to spiraling debt.  To help  get out the message and mobilize support for reform, the group is  releasing &quot;It's Always Christmas Time (For VISA),&quot; an animated  satire that takes aim at abusive credit card fees and practices.</p>

<p>   &quot;You can find yourself buried in debt if you aren't careful to  avoid the credit card gotchas,&quot; said Michelle Jun, Staff Attorney  for Consumers Union.   &quot;Too many credit cards are designed to get  you in debt and keep you there.&quot;</p>
<p>   &quot;It's Always Christmas Time (For VISA)&quot; is a lighthearted take  on the unexpected fees, interest rate hikes, and misleading  contracts that are contributing to high credit card debt in the  U.S.  After viewing the animation, viewers can send an email to  Congress asking lawmakers to support credit card reforms.

<p>   Consumers enjoy few protections when it comes to credit cards  and there are an increasing number of ways they can be penalized  with fees or get stuck with higher interest rates:</p>
<p>   -- Universal default:  Your interest rate can skyrocket if  your credit score declines because of your behavior with other  creditors even if you always pay your credit card on time and  never miss a payment.   Some card issuers will raise your rate if  you inquire about a car loan or open a new credit card.  </p>

<p>   -- Change of terms:  Credit card terms keep changing.  Read  the fine print and chances are you'll find this disclosure:  &quot;We  reserve the right to change the terms (including the APRs) at any  time for any reason.&quot;  A fixed rate is fixed until the bank gives  you at least 15 days notice that it isn't.  If you want to keep  your account open, you'll pay the higher new rate on your  existing balance.</p>
<p>   -- Teaser rates:  That low rate you signed up for expires  suddenly and you end up paying more.  A temptingly low  introductory rate can climb to 30 percent or more.    </p>
<p>   -- Minimim payment:  If you pay the minimum payment every  month, you'll end up paying a lot more than what you charged and  you could be on the hook for a very long time.</p>
<p>   -- On time payment:  Card issuers are systematically mailing  statements closer to the due date, giving customers less  turnaround time.  You can be hit with a late fee even if the  payment is mailed on time.  The average fee for a late payment  has more than doubled in the past decade.   </p>
<p>   -- Double cycle billing:  Finance charges are usually  calculated using the average daily balance.  If you alternate  between paying off and carrying a balance, you'll end up paying  more interest.</p>

<p>   -- Cash advance/convenience checks:  The interest rates on  these are higher than your credit card.</p>
<p>   -- Penalty interest and fees:  Late payments can raise your  interest from 7 percent to 27 percent !  Rather than rejecting  charges that exceed your credit card limit, issuers today often  let them go through but then charge a hefty fee -- as high as  $39.</p>
<p>   -- Fees, fees, and more fees:  As if the penalties weren't  enough, you pay more fees for paying by phone or charging abroad.   You may have to pay a fee to receive what used to be free year- end summary statements.</p>
<p>   -- Balance transfer switcheroo:  Transferring a balance from  an account with a high APR to another one with a lower interest  rate could come at a high cost.  Any payments you make are  typically applied first to the lowest rate balance.  So while the  credit card company uses your payment to quickly pay off that 0  percent transfer balance, you are piling up interest on  purchases, at say, 18 percent.  Multiple balance transfers will  hurt your credit score.  </p>
<p>   A recent report by the General Accounting Office (GAO) found  that there are many types of credit card fees, and that they have  risen much faster than inflation.  It also finds that current fee  disclosures are difficult to understand, bury important  information, and often fail to convey to cardholders when late  fees would be charged and what actions could result in penalty  interest rates.  The report found that 35 percent of active  credit cardholders of the six largest issuers were charged at  least one penalty fee in 2005, averaging $33.64.  </p>
<p>   Consumers Union is urging Congress to pass reforms to rein in  abusive credit card practices, including banning universal  default, stopping card issuers from applying punitive interest  rates to the entire balance, and requiring better disclosure so  consumers understand the true cost of making only the minimum  payment.

<p>   &quot;Getting trapped in the jaws of credit card debt has become  alarmingly easy,&quot; said Jun.  &quot;Congress should not let another  year go by without acting to prohibit abusive credit card fees  and practices.&quot;</p>
