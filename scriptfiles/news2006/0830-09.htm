<p>   &quot;Farm Aid is a movement inspired by artists who generously donate their time and talent to play on the Farm Aid stage,&quot; said Farm Aid Executive Director Carolyn Mugar. &quot;Once again, we are proud to welcome to the Farm Aid stage such a diverse and talented lineup.&quot;</p>

<p>   Since its beginning, Farm Aid has traveled the country, supporting local organizations working to strengthen and promote family farms. From Washington State to Washington, D.C., Farm Aid has helped family farmers create a movement that increases the supply and demand for family farm-identified food. Farm Aid's vision is for family farmers to provide us all with good products -- food, fiber and alternative fuels -- that protect our land, our health and our environment.</p>

<p>   Willie Nelson, Neil Young and John Mellencamp organized the first Farm Aid concert in 1985 to raise awareness about the loss of family farms and to raise funds to keep farm families on their land. Dave Matthews joined the Farm Aid Board of Directors in 2001. Farm Aid raises awareness about the critical role of family farms and has raised more than $29 million to build and strengthen family farm food production. Between 1985 and 2005, 80 percent of Farm Aid's total expenditures was spent on programs to benefit family farmers, exceeding charity watchdog standards. Through public education, program activities and grants, Farm Aid promotes food from family farms and sustainable agriculture, fights factory farms, advocates for fair farm prices and provides disaster assistance and credit counseling to farm families.</p>
