BIOGRAPHY: Julius Arile (23) &#8211; Julius was the millionth person to sign the million faces petition for tough arms controls. After presenting the petition to Kenyan President Daniel Arap Moi, he has travelled to New York to present UN Secretary General Kofi Annan with the petition. <br>
His background: Julius was born in Chemengwa village, West Pokot District, Kenya, an area known for its armed conflicts between the Pokot and  Karamoja  and Sebei tribes of Uganda. Fighting constantly interrupted his basic education and, after finally finishing primary school aged 15, he became a cattle raider and fighter to restock his fathers' herd. Over time, he has lost countless friends and relatives in these attacks. In one dawn attack on his village, hundreds of villagers were killed, including Julius&#8217;s brother. <br>
In 2004, Julius&#8217;s life changed during the Annual Peace Race held in West Pokot when he decided to give up fighting and to trade his AK47 for a running kit. He won the 10 kilometre race in the warriors' category that year and has never looked back. Now he is based at a small training camp in Kapenguria where he is training with other athletes and he competes in national athletics competitions. He has also encouraged his friends and family to give up arms and take up athletics to generate income instead. <br>

<b>Note to editors: </b><br>
The UN review conference<b> </b>is first major UN small arms meeting since the UN Programme of Action on Small Arms and Light Weapons was signed by states in 2001.  It presents a major opportunity for progress that will save lives, specifically for states to sign onto global principles to control arms transfers. There are currently no comprehensive global standards for governments&#8217; regulations of arms exports. 1000 people are killed every day by small arms. <br>
<br>
The Control Arms Campaign -- a joint initiative by Amnesty International, Oxfam International and the International Action Network on Small Arms (IANSA) -- is calling for tough global controls on the arms trade that currently fuels human rights violations, escalates conflicts and increases poverty. The campaign is calling on governments to introduce global principles at this world conference and, later this year, to begin negotiations on a binding arms trade treaty to regulate the transfers of weapons and ensure they do not end up in the hands of human rights abusers.<br>
