<p>BATON ROUGE - September 22 - On the  anniversary of Hurricane Rita, the state of Louisiana is finally  poised to start expending the billions of federal dollars needed  to rebuild housing along the Gulf Coast, according to  international aid agency Oxfam America, but this critical  investment could miss the neediest communities if non-profit and  faith-based groups aren't assigned a significant role in its  distribution.</p>
<p>   Oxfam called on state officials to ensure that locally based  groups -- the only major drivers of the recovery to date --  continue to play a central part in the taxpayer-financed  reconstruction effort. ICF International, the global consultancy  firm, was recently awarded an $87 million contract to run  Louisiana's Road Home Housing Program. </p>
<p>   &quot;For 12 long months, it's been the non-profit and faith-based  groups that have helped the poor folks across coastal Louisiana,  not the federal or state government,&quot; said Davida Finger,  Louisiana state coordinator for Oxfam's Gulf Coast Emergency  Program. &quot;Whole neighborhoods are coming back to life because of  the unflagging efforts of these groups and to cut them out now  would be disastrous to the recovery of poor communities.&quot;</p>
<p>   As Louisiana moves forward with the Road Home program, it is  vital that it empowers -- and funds -- these groups to continue  with the essential work they have started. </p>
<p>   &quot;Through volunteer labor and donated materials, non-profit and  faith-based groups have led the rebirth of the coast,&quot; added  Finger. &quot;In a federal and state response known best for what  didn't work, why on earth would you ignore the one part that  did?&quot;</p>
<p>   Through its tireless appeal efforts, the Houma-based  Terrebonne Readiness and Assistance Coalition (TRAC) has helped  storm-battered residents retrieve close to $1 million in the FEMA  assistance that was their due. </p>
<p>   &quot;We've stepped in to assist folks navigate the flawed FEMA  process as the system just doesn't make sense to most people,&quot;  said Peg Case, director of TRAC. &quot;If we weren't doing FEMA appeal  work, our clients would have gotten nothing. It's important we  remain involved in the next phase of the recovery so that no one  is left out.&quot;</p>
<p>   In Phoenix, the Zion Travelers Cooperative Center has inspired  a whole community revival with its self-help message: &quot;Let us  arise and rebuild.&quot; And in Vermilion Parish, the Southern Mutual  Help Association has worked with hundreds of families and  volunteers to rebuild their homes. </p>
<p>   &quot;It is the understanding that local groups have of the  impacted communities that is truly invaluable,&quot; said Charlette  Minor, co-chair of the Louisiana Housing Economic and Community  Development Collaborative, a group poised to reach out to the  tens of thousands yet not registered for the Road Home program.  &quot;Only through capitalizing on local networks and experience can  the Louisiana plan have a chance of providing poor families a  real Road Home. Without our involvement, the most vulnerable  families will remain lost and shut out of the recovery.&quot;</p>
