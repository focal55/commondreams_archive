<p>RESEARCH TRIANGLE PARK, North Carolina - June 27 - The  non-profit Clean Air Watch today urged the Bush administration to  reject a push by the oil industry to inject politics into the  process for setting national clean air standards.</p>
<p>   &quot;Don't pollute this process with politics,&quot; said Clean Air  Watch President Frank O'Donnell.  &quot;And don't let the oil industry  or other big special-interest polluters -- or White House  political operatives -- interfere with the EPA's scientific  integrity.&quot;</p>
<p>   Clean Air Watch joined with the American Lung Association and  other clean-air advocates as EPA held a &quot;workshop&quot; in North  Carolina on a controversial plan to change the way in which EPA  sets clean air standards.</p>
<p>   O'Donnell noted that the national standards &quot;are the heart and  lungs of the Clean Air Act.  They form the life support for all  the specific cleanup programs under the Clean Air Act.&quot;</p>
<p>   Those standards are supposed to be set solely based on  science.  </p>
<p>   The oil industry and other special interests have argued in  court that economics -- which means politics -- should be a  factor in setting those standards.  But the Supreme Court  unanimously rejected that argument.</p>
<p>   Now, however, the EPA is considering a different tactic by the  oil industry to achieve the same end.  </p>
<p>   &quot;We expect you to protect the scientific integrity of the  standard-setting process,&quot; O'Donnell said. </p>
<p>   &quot;That means rejecting the oil company special-interest attempt  to win here what they lost at the Supreme Court -- their attempt  to corrupt the process with politics.&quot;</p>
