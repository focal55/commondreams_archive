<p>WASHINGTON - July 29 - <br>

"A majority of Americans and a majority of lawmakers in Washington say they support a minimum wage increase. Unfortunately, Republican leaders in Congress are using gimmicks and stall tactics to deny our lowest wage earners a needed raise.

<p>"Republican leaders must stop their gimmicks and allow a clean vote to increase the minimum wage to $7.25 without harmful amendments and unrealistic demands that will only hurt minimum wage earners more.

<p>"For the past decade, the minimum wage has remained stagnant at $5.15 an hour while prices at the supermarket and the gas pump have steadily increased, utility costs have soared, and politicians in Washington gave themselves eight pay raises.

<p>"The value of the minimum wage has fallen so low that it now takes a minimum wage earner a day and a half's pay just to fill up their gas tank to get to work for the week. That's more than a week's less pay for groceries, rent, health care, child care, and other necessary expenses each month.

<p>"It's time for Congress to stand up for hardworking Americans struggling to make ends meet on the minimum wage. We urge lawmakers to approve a minimum wage increase before Election Day when millions of workers will be casting their votes."
