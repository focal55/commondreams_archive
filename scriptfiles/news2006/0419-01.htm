<p>WASHINGTON - April 19 - Citizens for  Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) today filed a  Department of Justice (DOJ) complaint against Rep. Pete Sessions  (R-Texas) for official actions he may have taken on behalf of  disgraced lobbyist Jack Abramoff, as well as possible bribes he  may have accepted from a San Francisco defense technology  company.</p>
<p>   The complaint asks for the DOJ to immediately begin an  investigation into Rep. Sessions.</p>
<p>   Abramoff Ties</p>
<p>   CREW's complaint alleges that Rep. Sessions co-signed two  letters, one to former Attorney General John Ashcroft in 2001 and  another to former Interior Secretary Gale Norton in 2002, which  benefitted Mr. Abramoff's client, the Louisiana Coushatta.  One  month after his 2002 letter was sent, Rep. Sessions' political  action committee, PETE PAC, received $3,500 from the Louisiana  Coushatta and another $3,500 from other tribes with casinos.  Within 18 months, PETE PAC received $20,500 from tribes  associated with Abramoff.</p>
<p>   Rep. Sessions also traveled to Malaysia on an Abramoff- arranged trip with indicted public relations executive Michael  Scanlon, two lobbyists from Abramoff's firm Greenberg Traurig,  one of which, Tony Rudy has been indicted, and two other Members  of Congress, Dana Rohrabacher (R-Calif.) and Gregory Meeks (D- N.Y.). Prior to the trip, Rep. Sessions had shown no public  interest in Malaysia, but four months after the trip, Rep.  Sessions became an advocate for Malaysia by forming the Malaysia  Trade, Security and Economic Cooperation in the House with trip- mate Rep. Meeks.</p>
<p>   Promia Ties</p>
<p>   Additionally, Rep. Sessions promoted the interests of Promia,  a firm based in San Francisco that hired Session's former  communications director, Adrian Plesha, as vice president and  director of its Washington office. Mr. Plesha pleaded guilty to  felony charges related to FEC offences shortly after he began  working for Promia.</p>
<p>   Promia was able to garner a nearly $800,000 Navy research and  development contract in May, 2000 and Rep. Sessions, along with  Rep. Curt Weldon (R-Pa.), publicly worked to get an additional $8  million to Promia through a Department of Defense grant.</p>
<p>   In October 2000, the same month that Promia received $2  million from Trautman Wasserman &amp; Co., a New York venture capital  firm, Rep. Sessions received the maximum allowed -- $1,000 each,  from eight  Promia executives for his re-election campaign. In  2002, Promia gave $30,000 to PETE PAC. In total Promia and its  executives have contributed nearly $55,000 to Rep. Sessions since  2000 -- by far the largest contribution Promia has made to any  Member of Congress.</p>
<p>   &quot;Why would Rep. Sessions, who represents a northern Texas  district, work so hard for and receive so much cash from a San  Francisco firm?&quot; Melanie Sloan, executive director of CREW asked  today. &quot;The Department of Justice should open a criminal  investigation to determine whether the campaign contributions  Rep. Sessions received from Abramoff, the tribes and from Promia  executives were a quid pro quo for official actions.&quot;</p>
