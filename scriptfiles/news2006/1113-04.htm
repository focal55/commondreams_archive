<p>WASHINGTON  - November 13 - Green Party leaders challenged Democrats, whose victory in regaining Congress on Tuesday was
          largely a result of voters who wish for a quick end to the U.S. occupation of Iraq, and who seek a reversal of current
          foreign policy.
<p class="navigate">"Poll after poll showed that a clear majority of voters made their choice to vote Democrat because they oppose the war on Iraq," said Jody Grage, Treasurer of the Green Party of the United States.  "Poll after poll in Iraq revealed the same thing -- that the Iraqi people want the destruction and mass killing to stop, and want U.S. forces out of their country.  If Democrats have any sense of democracy, responsibility, or humanity, they will send President Bush a demand for immediate withdrawal of U.S. troops."</p>
          <p class="navigate"><b>Greens called on Democrats to adopt the following agenda:</b></p>
        <blockquote>
          <p class="navigate">Bring the troops home now: immediate withdrawal of U.S. military forces from Iraq; cancel further military spending for the occupation.</p>
          <p class="navigate">Launch a probe into the White House's fraudulent justifications for the invasion of Iraq; violations of the U.S. Constitution; no-bid contracts and giveaways to corporate war profiteers like Halliburton and Bechtel; violations of Geneva Conventions, especially the use of torture; suppression of scientific research about global warming.&nbsp;
          &quot;Democrats should initiate impeachment proceedings and press for criminal charges, to deter the Bush Administration's massive abuses of power from ever happening again," said Jeff Kravitz, California Green candidate for Congress (5th District) in the 2006 election and a professor of constitutional law.</p>
          <p class="navigate">Reaffirm the U.S.'s commitment to the Geneva Conventions and international law.</p>
          <p class="navigate">Demand that the U.S. sign on to the Kyoto protocols and begin renegotiation to address new scientific information
          about the threat of global warming and its growing role in international security.</p>
          <p class="navigate">Demand that the Bush White House cease threatening Iran and pursue negotiation; maintain pressure on Israel not
          to launch an attack on Iran.</p>
          <p class="navigate">Demand that the Bush White House press Israel to observe full human rights for Arab Israelis and end the illegal
          occupation of Palestinian lands and attacks on Palestinian people; and cut off arms shipments and military aid for
          Israel.</p>
          <p class="navigate">&quot;The Middle East crisis is headed towards further conflict and mass murder, as evidenced by the appointment of extremist Avigdor Lieberman, who advocates expelling Arab citizens, as Israel's Strategic Affairs Minister, and Israel's massacre on Wednesday of 18 Palestinian civilians, including eight children.  The attack topped off a week long siege and killing spree that claimed the lives of more than 80 Palestinians in Beit Hanoun in the Gaza Strip," said Aimee Smith, 2006 Green candidate for the U.S. House in Michigan's 15th District.  "Unfortunately, Democratic leaders in Congress like Hillary Clinton [N.Y.] and Nancy Pelosi [Calif.] are as much under the spell of AIPAC [American Israel Public Affairs Committee] as Republicans are."</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p class="navigate">Greens emphasized that all of the above agenda are necessary for global peace, security, and stability, and urged antiwar voters and organizations like MoveOn.org and United For Peace and Justice to keep pressure on Democrats in Congress.<br>
        <br>
        "If Democrats in Congress don't act within the coming months to end the occupation of Iraq and reverse U.S. policy on Iran and Israel, it'll prove that all the antiwar votes they received on November 7 will have been wasted on America's second war party," said Nan Garrett, Co-Chair of the Georgia Green Party and Spokesperson for the National Women's Caucus of the Green Party.<br>
