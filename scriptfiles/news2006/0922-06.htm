<p>WASHINGTON - September 22 - Larry Cox, Amnesty  International USA's executive director, issued the following  statement in response to the proposed agreement reached by  President Bush and Senate Republicans regarding detainee  legislation:</p>
<p>   &quot;Amnesty International is deeply disturbed by the proposed  compromise between Senate leaders and the White House on detainee  legislation. Without further clarification the legislation leaves  loopholes big enough to drive a Humvee through. The parties  appear to have negotiated themselves right back to the starting  line.  The core of the public debate between senior Republican  leaders and the administration largely hinged on the president's  ability to interpret the Geneva Conventions as he saw fit and as  he basically granted himself authority to do in the war on  terror.  Key Senators argued, rightly, that the Conventions must  stay intact.  Yet, in the alleged 'win-win' compromise, it  appears that the president can reinterpret the Conventions, amend  the War Crimes Act and even give a greenlight to treatment long- considered torture.  Without additional clarity, the proposed  agreement betrays American values of justice and long-held  agreements and obligations on basic humane treatment. There can  be no compromise for torture.</p>
<p>   This is not a time for electoral calculations on either side  of the aisle.  Winning or losing elections doesn't matter if the  price of victory is a profound betrayal of principle -- and, make  no mistake about it, the proposed legislation has that potential.   This bill could confirm America as a nation unbound by human  rights standards Americans lived by, fought for and promoted for  decades.&quot;</p>
<p>   Amnesty International has launched the &quot;America I Believe In&quot;  campaign because we believe that the United States is facing a  defining moment: the nation can continue to be one of the world's  leaders on human rights or lose its moral authority on fairness  and justice.  Some of the campaign activities have included  advertisements in major print and online publications and  personal calls and visits to congressional members.  Actually,  over the past week, Amnesty International members and other  citizens sent nearly 50,000 letters to Congress urging lawmakers  to keep the Conventions intact and not to cede the nation's  values.
