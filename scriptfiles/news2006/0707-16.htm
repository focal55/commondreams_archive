WASHINGTON - July 7 - 

<blockquote><i>"Because decisions being taken today could lock in investment and increase emissions for decades to come, it is important to act wisely now."</i><br> 
- G8 Communique on Climate Change, Clean Energy and Sustainable Development, Gleneagles, Scotland, 2005 
</blockquote>
<p>We, representatives of the next generation, have come together from around the world to fervently oppose the draft Plan of Action on Global Energy Security for the G8's St. Petersburg Summit in July 2006. We view the proposed plan of action, as detailed in documents leaked to the media, to be in direct contradiction to steps taken by the G8 in 2005 to address human induced global climate change and global poverty, and as such an outrageous abdication of leadership by the G8 leaders. From the most powerful political leaders on Earth, we demand better. 

<p>As youth, we will live with the decisions made by today's political leaders. In particular, we will be the ones most affected by unmitigated global climate change, the dangers of the proliferation of nuclear energy, and failures to address global poverty. We know that the global challenges of climate change and poverty demand our persistent efforts and as it is our future at stake with must voice our opposition and work to build new alternatives for the future. That's why we, as individuals, groups and networks, are working at local, regional and national levels to bring about practical and policy changes which will help address the problem of climate change. We are now coming together, as a global youth movement, to challenge you to take effective action at the global level. 

<p>The draft Plan of Action on Global Energy Security for the G8's St. Petersburg Summit emphasizes a "predict and provide" approach to energy demand, and defines energy security as being able to provide for growing energy demands through fossil fuels and nuclear energy. In particular, the document states an expectation for $17 trillion in investment in energy infrastructure over the coming decades. If this investment continues as proposed, with fossil fuels and nuclear energy, it will lock the world into a massive increase in greenhouse gas emissions that can only lead to dangerous and irreversible global climate change. The G8's own 2005 Communique on Climate Change, Clean Energy and Sustainable Development warned of this potential and urged leaders to avoid it. 

<p>Even if we continue at our current rate of extraction and use of oil, gas and coal the resulting carbon emissions would still be many times higher than the levels needed to keep global temperatures at 'safe' levels; yet the G8 document aims to "expand [the] hydrocarbon resource base in a way that would outpace its depletion". We are also deeply concerned that G8 leaders are giving a strong endorsement to unreliable, high-risk nuclear technology, including nuclear fuel cycle systems. Mindful of the tremendous social and environmental impacts remaining from the Chernobyl disaster, and concerned by the ineffectiveness of nuclear energy in combating climate change, the world needs no new reminders of the dangers of nuclear energy. 

<p>In today's world, it is impossible to discuss energy security apart from global climate change and global poverty. Any attempt at true energy security looks not to securing the extraction of energy resources from developing countries, but to clean, safe, renewable energy and the reduction of energy demand in the developed world, so that energy services can be made available to all whilst safeguarding our climate. We call for G8 leaders to adopt a new definition for energy security that recognizes these realities. 

<p>Investments in clean, safe, renewable energy and energy efficiency play only minor roles in the draft Plan of Action, yet these are the only solutions that can provide us with true energy security, a protected climate, and an end to global poverty. We have the opportunity today to change how we produce and use energy and in doing so create a safer, more equitable world We call for the G8 to greatly increase investments in clean, safe, renewable energy and energy efficiency, reverse its emphasis on fossil fuels and phase out all subsidies for fossil fuels and nuclear energy, and keep climate change and global poverty at the top of its agenda until these problems are solved.
