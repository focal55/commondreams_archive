<p>CHICAGO - March 16 - Yesterday's announcement  by police in Chicago that a gun trafficker under federal  investigation since last summer allegedly killed a 14-year-old  child in a blaze of assault weapon fire is further proof of the  need for local, state and Federal officials to take serious steps  to combat illegal gun trafficking. </p>
<p>   Carail Weeks purchased a firearm last July that was recovered  as the gun used in an armed robbery eight days later. Federal law  enforcement authorities traced the gun to Weeks, according to the  Chicago Tribune, who bought it from a dealership in Indianapolis  notorious for selling guns later recovered in crime. </p>
<p>   Had federal gun laws been stronger, Weeks may not have been  able to traffic that initial gun, or been able to purchase  multiple guns at a nearby gun store also notorious for selling  crime guns.  Certainly Weeks, a man who had been arrested  numerous times and who was using false identification, should not  have been able to purchase the Romanian WASR-10 assault rifle and  high-capacity magazine used to kill 14-year-old Starkesia Reed in  Chicago on March 3rd. </p>
<p>   Authorities know of at least two gun dealerships where Weeks  purchased firearms:  Don's Guns in Indianapolis and Brandi's in  Camby, Indiana.  Between them, Don's and Brandi's have sold  thousands of guns that were later traced to crimes. </p>
<p>   &quot;Another child has died who didn't need to die,&quot; said Jim  Brady, the former press secretary to President Reagan who was  wounded in an assassination attempt on the President 25 years ago  this month.  &quot;We need to strangle the illegal gun trade by  strengthening the hand of federal agents investigating these gun  traffickers, stopping people from buying multiple firearms, and  padlocking the doors of the worst gun dealers in America.&quot; </p>
<p>   There are a number of policies that could be enacted at the  federal, state and local level to stop illegal gun trafficking  and reduce gun violence.  Unfortunately, at the Federal level,  policy makers have actually taken steps that have made the  situation not only worse but also harder to detect.   Unfortunately, the Bush Administration and Congress have recently  implemented a number of measures that only help corrupt gun  sellers, such as requiring the destruction of background check  records and shielding corrupt gun sellers from scrutiny in the  civil courts. </p>
<p>   Among the steps that should be taken: </p>
<p>   -- Allow the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and  Explosives (ATF) to inspect federal firearms licensees more than  once a year.  Under current law, the ATF is limited to one  routine record keeping inspection of a federal firearms licensee  within a 12-month period. </p>
<p>   -- Allow ATF to fine gun sellers or suspend their federal  firearm licenses if they commit a crime. ATF generally may not  impose a fine or license suspension on gun dealers who violate  the law.  Instead, ATF may attempt to revoke a dealer's license,  but this gives ATF limited enforcement flexibility by requiring  an all-or-nothing approach - ATF can either begin a difficult  revocation proceeding or levy no administrative penalty at all.   One ATF Director testified, &quot; 1/8W 3/8hen we attempt to revoke  1/8a  dealer's 3/8 license, his remedies are such that it may go on for 2  or 3 years...&quot; </p>
<p>   -- Prohibit bulk sales of handguns.  Currently, federal law  does not limit the number of firearms that a person can purchase  in a single transaction.  So gun traffickers can buy dozens of  guns at a time.  And gun traffickers usually deal in handguns.   Though the gun lobby has worked to block more recent data, an  analysis of 1999 data showed that handguns comprised 78 percent  of all traced crime guns.  Congress should pass legislation  stopping large volume handgun sales so that gun traffickers  cannot amass the supply of guns they need to make their illegal  sales worthwhile. </p>
<p>   -- Change the reporting requirement for &quot;multiple sales,&quot;  which are a significant indicator of gun trafficking, so that gun  sellers must report &quot;multiple sales&quot; of two or more handguns  within 30 days, instead of the current five business day period.  Current federal law requires dealers to report to ATF any  &quot;multiple sales&quot; of two or more handguns that occur within five  consecutive business days.  This allows gun traffickers to buy a  handgun every sixth business day and still acquire a significant  number of handguns for illegal resale without any &quot;multiple sale&quot;  notification to law enforcement. </p>
<p>   Gun industry extremists, meanwhile, have been blocking the  Illinois legislature from banning AK-47s and their clones - the  type of gun used in the Reed homicide. Earlier this week,  Illinois gun industry lobbyist Richard Pearson said Chicago Mayor  Richard Daley was &quot;delusional&quot; for wanting to stiffen gun laws,  and the gun lobby has targeted Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich  for defeat in November for his support of the assault weapons ban  proposal. </p>
<p>   &quot;It is past time for the state to act to get these weapons off  the streets, and Illinois should set an example for Indiana to  follow,&quot; said Jennifer Bishop, Illinois State Director for the  Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence. </p>
<p>   As the nation's largest, non-partisan, grassroots organization  leading the fight to prevent gun violence, the Brady Campaign,  working with its dedicated network of Million Mom March Chapters,  is devoted to creating an America free from gun violence, where  all Americans are safe at home, at school, at work, and in our  communities. </p>
