<p>NEW YORK  - November 21 - The American Civil Liberties Union today released new Pentagon 
documents showing that counterterrorism resources were used to monitor American 
groups opposed to the war in Iraq and military recruitment. The ACLU is calling 
on Congress to investigate the widespread surveillance of political and 
religious groups by the Defense Department, the FBI and the Department of 
Homeland Security. 
<P>&#8220;There is increasing evidence that the Pentagon improperly targeted innocent 
Americans for surveillance,&#8221; said Ben Wizner, an ACLU staff attorney. &#8220;These 
documents send a chilling message that if you oppose the war, the military is 
watching you. That is simply un-American.&#8221;</P>
<P>The documents released today consist of nine reports from the Pentagon&#8217;s 
Threat and Local Observation Notice (TALON) database that describe as &#8220;threats&#8221; 
several planned demonstrations at military recruitment stations, including sites 
on college campuses. One report focuses on a planned protest at the Sacramento 
Military Entrance Processing Station by &#8220;a Sacramento chapter of a US domestic 
group.&#8221; According to the report, &#8220;this specific group is deeply into 
&#8216;counter-recruiting,&#8217;&#8221; and views the station &#8220;as their last chance to influence 
a decision to enlist.&#8221; Commanders of the Sacramento and San Jose stations were 
advised of the protests by the San Francisco Joint Terrorism Task Force. The 
report notes that &#8220;it appears this protest will most likely be peaceful, but 
some type of vandalism is always a possibility.&#8221; </P>
<P>An April 8, 2005 report lists planned protests by Veterans for Peace at nine 
different universities across the country. The source of the information, 
described as an active duty Army officer, states that &#8220;Veterans for Peace is a 
peaceful organization, but there is potential future protest could become 
violent.&#8221; </P>
<P>Another report, dated April 22, 2005, attempts to justify surveillance of 
Veterans for Peace by pointing to an altercation between a solider and an 
individual at a university anti-war rally in New Orleans. According to the 
report, the soldier mistakenly arrived at the campus demonstration and was 
confronted by the individual. A security officer instructed the soldier to leave 
the area. Although the organization had a permit for the rally, and it is 
unknown whether the individual was a student or a veteran, the TALON report 
claims that &#8220;Veterans for Peace should be viewed as a possible threat to Army 
and DoD personnel.&#8221; The report was shared with local army personnel, the New 
Orleans Police Department and the New Orleans Joint Terrorism Task Force.</P>
<P>&#8220;It is appalling that the Pentagon would label peace activists-including 
those of us who put our lives at risk defending this country-as potential 
threats,&#8221; said Michael T. McPhearson, Executive Director of Veterans for Peace. 
&#8220;The federal government should not be wasting valuable resources gathering files 
on peaceful protesters who disagree with the Bush administration&#8217;s 
policies.&#8221;&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>The documents come in response to a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit filed 
by the ACLU earlier this year after evidence surfaced that the Pentagon was 
secretly conducting surveillance of peaceful anti-war and counter-military 
recruitment groups, including Quakers and student groups. After public outcry, 
Deputy Secretary of Defense Gordon England announced in January that 
intelligence personnel would receive &#8220;refresher training on the policies for 
collection, retention, dissemination and use of information related to U.S. 
persons.&#8221; </P>
<P>So far Congress has failed to investigate how the Pentagon collected the 
information on innocent Americans, and which other agencies received these 
reports. In addition, Congress has yet to act on the hundreds of FBI documents 
previously obtained by the ACLU that show widespread surveillance by Joint 
Terrorism Task Forces of peace activists, religious groups, environmental groups 
and animal rights activists. </P>
<P>&#8220;Congress must shed light on this effort to spy on veterans and Quakers,&#8221; 
said Caroline Fredrickson, Director of the ACLU Washington Legislative Office. 
&#8220;We are pleased that new leaders have signaled a desire to get serious about 
congressional oversight. No American should ever be targeted for exercising his 
or her First Amendment rights.&#8221;</P>
<P>Other documents released today include a February 24, 2005 report on protests 
planned at three New York City recruiting stations by the War Resisters League, 
which advocates nonviolence as the method for creating a democratic society. The 
report includes guidelines from the protest organizers stressing that 
participants must agree not to engage in physical violence or verbal use and not 
to damage any property. Still, in the same report, a Department of Homeland 
Security agent warned that individual members of the group may favor &#8220;civil 
disobedience and vandalism.&#8221; The report indicates that the FBI Joint Terrorism 
Task Forces in Atlanta and New York were briefed on the planned protests.</P>
