<p>WASHINGTON / NEW YORK - June 12 - The Consumer Federation of
America (CFA) and American Express Company today reported initial findings of the first phase
of research on the effectiveness of consumer credit counseling. This research was undertaken by
the Georgetown University Credit Research Center using data supplied by ten leading consumer
credit counseling agencies.
<p>At a time when credit counseling agencies are experiencing both increased regulatory
scrutiny and greater demand, in part because the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 2005 requires
consumers who file for bankruptcy to receive credit counseling, CFA and American Express are
trying to better understand what aspects of counseling programs are most effective in reducing
consumer credit risk (as measured by changes in credit scores). In the first phase of the research,
ten participating agencies supplied archived data on nearly 60,000 of their clients who were
counseled during 2003 to the national credit reporting agency TransUnion.* The objectives for
this phase of the research included an analysis of client credit profiles and history at a point two
years following their counseling session to determine the impact of the counseling delivery
method (in-person and telephone) on client outcomes.

<p>"American Express is very pleased to partner with CFA in reaching a common goal of
identifying the best credit counseling practices to benefit consumers,” said Anand Joshi, vice
president, Collections Management and Strategy, American Express. “For decades, creditors
have supported the important work of consumer credit counseling agencies, and this research
allows for a more robust understanding of best practices." The company is funding the research
through grants issued to the participating agencies and to the Georgetown University Credit
Research Center.
<p>"CFA commends American Express for generously supporting this important research,"
said Stephen Brobeck, executive director of CFA, which is managing the project. "Debt-ridden
consumers, as well as all credit issuers and counseling agencies, will be the beneficiaries," he
added.
<p>The findings of the first year's research are broad but tentative, and point to areas where
additional research will be beneficial to better understand more detailed components of credit
counseling’s impact. As the study focuses on the experience of consumers at ten agencies that
emphasize client education, the results may not reflect the average experience of agency clients
across the country. "This represents the most thorough research on the topic, yet was limited by
the characteristics of data collected by agencies in the past," said principal researcher Dr. Michael
Staten. "In phase two of the research, the agencies will be collecting data on an array of new,
more specific variables related to program features and client characteristics," he added.
<p>The first phase of research is described in an accompanying report prepared by Dr. Staten.
Three of the more interesting preliminary findings are summarized below.
<p>The act of seeking counseling is a valuable "early warning" indicator of serious
financial trouble that facilitates timely intervention and assistance. Credit bureau
information available at the time of counseling often does not reflect private information that
many counseled clients possess regarding recent or impending negative changes to their financial
condition.
<p>"One implication of this finding is that delinquent borrowers could benefit if they receive
early assistance from credit counseling agencies," said Dr. Staten. “Because clients seeking credit
counseling have a real-time, private view of their financial situation, risk scores for these
borrowers underestimate the likelihood that they will have credit problems in the future. As a
result, creditors have limited indicators that such borrowers may need assistance. Effective credit
counseling agencies can help to identify borrowers who are in financial distress and focus
resources to help them improve their financial condition.”
<p>Telephone and face-to-face delivery of the initial counseling appear to generate
equivalent outcomes for consumers' creditworthiness measured two years later. This is true
both for clients who complete only an initial counseling session and those who enter debt
management programs (DMPs).

<p>"While some may find this result surprising, it does not, at this stage of our research, lead
to the conclusion that the two delivery methods are equally effective for all debtors," said Staten.
"In year two of the research, we will examine more specific client characteristics to learn if
certain types of debtors benefit more from one delivery method than from the other," he added.
The creditworthiness of consumers who participated in DMPs improved.
<p>Consumers who were recommended for a DMP by agencies and chose to start payments had a
significantly lower incidence of bankruptcy, as well as improved bankruptcy and delinquency
risk scores, over the two years following counseling than did those who were recommended for a
DMP and chose not to start.
<p>"This preliminary finding warrants more detailed follow-up research. It suggests that the
discipline of DMP participation for qualified individuals, coupled with ongoing interaction with
the counseling agency, helps clients improve their credit scores," said Dr. Staten. "In phase two
of the research, we will especially seek to understand the characteristics of those who are likely
to see the greatest benefit from participation in DMPs and, as a result, understand the size of the
impact," he added.
<p>The agencies that are participating in the study include: Auriton Solutions of Roseville,
Minnesota; ClearPoint Financial Solutions, Inc. of Richmond, Virginia; Consumer Credit
Counseling Service of Greater Atlanta, Inc.; Consumer Credit Counseling Service of Los
Angeles; Consumer Credit Counseling Service of Montana; Consumer Credit Counseling Service
of North Central Texas, Inc.; InCharge Debt Solutions of Orlando, Florida; LSS Financial
Counseling Service of Duluth, Minnesota; Novadebt of Freehold, New Jersey; and Money
Management International of Houston, Texas.
