<p>WASHINGTON - December 13 - Andrew L. Stern, International President of the nation’s largest health care union in North America, made the following statement today at a press conference held by Senator Ron Wyden (D-OR) to announce a new, comprehensive proposal to provide quality, affordable health care for all Americans:</p>

<p>"America, joined by the rest of the world, is living through a profound, transformative economic revolution as we change from a manufacturing to a finance, information, and service economy – muscle work to mind work-and from a national to an international economy.</p>

<p>“This is not our fathers’ and grandfathers’ economy.  More people went to work today in retail than manufacturing.  People will send 84 billion emails in this 24 hours period.  And the world produced last year more transistors than grains of rice, and the transistors cost less.</p>

<p>“Our employer based health care system is a relic of a national and industrial economy.  Today, America cannot compete in a global economy when we put the price of health care on the cost of our products, and our competitor nations do not.  It is a failed job creation, trade, and economic policy, not to mention the moral dimension of the uninsured and underinsured.</p>

<p>“It is time for fundamental, not incremental change, and Senator Wyden has a plan that is practical and principled, and sets down a moral test:  Why doesn’t every American have the right to the same health care as the President, the Vice President, 535 members of Congress, and 3 million Federal workers?</p>

<p>“On behalf of the 1.9 million members of SEIU and their families, and as the largest union of health care workers, we believe Senator Wyden has made a critical contribution to the debate that Congress must attend to next year.  Americans are sick and tired, and cannot afford to wait any longer for change.”</p>

<p>SEIU (Service Employees International Union), the fastest-growing union in North America and the largest health care union.  Stern has called for a fundamental reshaping of the nation’s health care system, recently challenging CEOs of the Fortune 500 to partner with SEIU to develop a new model that solves the health care crisis for American workers and businesses alike.  Stern’s commitment to the issue also led him to create SEIU's Americans for Health Care project, a grassroots network to make health care a top political priority in key states across the country. </p>
