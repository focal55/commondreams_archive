<p>WASHINGTON - February 14 - Traveling to Los Angeles from New York, Boston and other parts of the nation, members from September 11th Families for Peaceful Tomorrows, an organization composed of family members of those killed on September 11, 2001, will stand before the U.S. Bank Building recently identified as the target of a failed terrorist attack in 2002. This lauded organization will bear witness to the human cost of terrorism and renew its call for international cooperation, foreign policies based on principles of democracy and human rights, and dialogue around the underlying causes of terrorism as means of combating continuing threats of violence against the United States.

<p>The press conference will take place on the occasion of the group's fourth anniversary. They will announce plans to create a global network of victims of terrorism and war, a process which will culminate in a New York area gathering of 30 international representatives in the days leading up to September 11, 2006.

<p>Since its founding, members of Peaceful Tomorrows have made more than 400 speaking events in 28 states and 14 foreign countries, where they have made contact with a host of other civilian victims of terrorism and war, including families in Afghanistan and Iraq; victims of the cycles of violence in Israel and Palestine; family members of victims of the nightclub bombing in Bali and the train bombings in Madrid; family members of those killed in Oklahoma City; survivors of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki; those who survived the bombing of Guernica, Spain and Dresden, Germany; those affected by terrorism in Kenya, Cambodia, Chechnya, South Africa, Northern Ireland, Bosnia, Sri Lanka, Colombia, Guatemala and elsewhere.

<p>Peaceful Tomorrows will co-sponsor several events during the week with the Los Angeles chapter of the Nobel Peace Prize winning organization, Physicians for Social Responsibility. Peaceful Tomorrows has been nominated for the 2003 and 2004 Nobel Peace Prize.
