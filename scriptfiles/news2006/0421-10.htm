<p>NEW YORK - April 21 - Responding to the revelation that the Department of Homeland 
Security (DHS) has reached a secret agreement to share airline passenger data 
with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the American Civil 
Liberties Union today said it has asked the CDC to disclose details of the deal. 
<P></P>
<P>&#8220;The tracking of data on airline passengers, which can amount to building 
lifetime dossiers on Americans, has been a hotly debated issue for many years &#8211; 
and now we find out that two government agencies may have agreed, behind the 
public&#8217;s back, to share data,&#8221; said Barry Steinhardt, Director of the ACLU&#8217;s 
Technology and Liberty Project.&nbsp; &#8220;These agencies have no justification for 
instituting a major new data-sharing arrangement on this issue, with all of its 
implications for privacy, and keeping it hidden from public scrutiny and 
debate.&#8221;&nbsp; </P>
<P>The ACLU&#8217;s request for information was filed today as a Freedom of 
Information Act (FOIA) request for a copy of the memorandum and related 
information.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Disclosure of the secret agreement comes at a time when the CDC is proposing 
controversial regulations that would require the airlines to collect and turn 
over a broad array of personal information on air travelers.&nbsp; In formal 
comments about the draft regulations submitted in March, the ACLU called the 
proposal &#8220;a coercive data grab that will allow the unregulated data surveillance 
of hundreds of millions of Americans.&#8221;&nbsp; The surveillance of airline 
passengers through data collection has also been debated in the context of the 
government&#8217;s failed &#8220;CAPPS II&#8221; program and its current &#8220;Secure Flight&#8221; program &#8211; 
both of which purport to protect against terrorism by collecting information on 
millions of travelers. </P>
<P>The agreement was disclosed in comments on the CDC&#8217;s draft regulations by the 
Air Transport Association of America, which said that a written Memorandum of 
Understanding between the two agencies reportedly includes &#8220;provisions for data 
sharing, including allowing CDC access to passenger information.&#8221;&nbsp; </P>
<P>That deal, Steinhardt said, appears to violate an agreement between the 
United States and the European Union over the sharing of European passenger 
data.&nbsp; Under the agreement, the European Commission found that U.S. privacy 
protections were &#8220;adequate&#8221; to protect the privacy of Europeans under the E.U. 
legal standard (a finding that is currently being challenged by the European 
Parliament in the European Court of Justice).&nbsp; In return, DHS agreed that 
the passenger data would not be used for any purpose other than preventing acts 
of terrorism or other serious crimes.&nbsp; </P>
<P>&#8220;Once again, we are seeing that DHS cannot be trusted to exhibit restraint in 
the handling of personal information,&#8221; said ACLU Legislative Counsel Tim 
Sparapani.&nbsp; &#8220;They collect information, say they&#8217;ll use it for one purpose, 
and then they turn around and use it for another.&#8221;&nbsp; Added Steinhardt, &#8220;This 
provision violates not only the agreement with the European Union, but a core 
principle of privacy that is recognized around the world.&#8221;</P>
