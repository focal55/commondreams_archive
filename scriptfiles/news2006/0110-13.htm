<p>WASHINGTON - January 10 - The ONDCP is back on the road, trying to convince parents and teachers that costly, ineffective random student drug testing is the "silver bullet" to combat adolescent drug use.

<p>Organize a group to attend the summit near you, ask questions that will really put the drug war zealots on the spot, and arm yourself with literature that attendees can take home. Even if none of the summits are close enough for you to attend, you can still get involved by spreading the word.  Visit our toolkit for complete information on how to get involved.

<p>Meeting locations and dates are:

<p>Orlando, FL, January 19, 2006<br>

San Diego, CA, February 22, 2006<br>

Falls Church, VA, March 15, 2006<br>

Milwaukee, WI, April 25, 2006

<p>Drug testing is humiliating, costly and ineffective, but it's an easy anti-drug soundbite for the White House. Student testing breaks the trust between children and adults, and drives students away from extracurricular activities.  What's more, studies even show that student drug testing doesn't work to deter drug use. Read the story of how one student's life was turned upside down by drug testing.
