<p>NEW YORK - November 3 - In communities across the  country, voters could be subject to intimidation and a variety of  suppressive tactics meant to keep them from casting a ballot.  Demos, a national, non-partisan public policy center, published  the details of these potential challenges to voting rights in a  new briefing paper this week.</p>
<p>   The Voter Intimidation and Vote Suppression briefing paper,  part of Demos' Challenges to Fair Elections series highlighting  trouble spots and voting rights problems in the '06 election,  shows how campaigns to suppress voter turnout take a variety of  forms, are often mounted in communities of color, and that many  go unnoticed or unchallenged until after it is too late. Even  after many documented cases of vote suppression/voter  intimidation came to light in the last several elections, few  states have enacted clear and effective prohibitions against  these abuses.</p>
<p>   &quot;It's unfortunate that, in 2006, we need to be so concerned  with potential threats to an individual's right to vote from  partisan operatives,&quot; said Steven Carbo, senior director of the  Democracy Program at Demos. &quot;But with so many documented cases of  suppression and intimidation in 2004, and recorded abuses already  this year in primary elections, we must be as vigilant as ever.&quot;</p>

<p>   ---</p>
<p>   The Facts:</p>
<p>   Organized misinformation campaigns often target minority  communities in the run-up to Election Day.</p>
<p>   14,000 Latino residents in Orange Co., California, received a  letter in October 2006 warning that it was a crime for immigrants  to vote and cautioning that they could be jailed or deported if  they went to the polls in November. These are naturalized  citizens eligible to vote, as guaranteed by law.</p>
<p>   A fictitious &quot;Milwaukee Black Voters League&quot; distributed  fliers intended to suppress black voters in largely African- American neighborhoods in 2004. The fliers claimed that voters  could not cast a ballot if they had already voted that year or if  any family member had been found guilty of a crime. &quot;If you  violate any of these laws, you can get ten years in prison and  your children will be taken away from you,&quot; the flier warned.</p>

<p>   A memo on bogus letterhead of the Lake Co., Ohio, Board of  Elections was sent to local residents in 2004, stating that  registrations submitted through the Democratic Party and the  NAACP were invalid.</p>
<p>   A bogus advisory purported to be from the Franklin Co., Ohio,  Board of Elections in 2004 advised that Democrats were being  asked to vote on the day after the November election at their  regular polling places, due to heavy voter registration.  Republicans would vote on the actual election date. The targeted  area, Columbus' near east side, is predominantly African  American.</p>
<p>   Many states allow partisan operatives to selectively challenge  voters at the polls - sometimes resulting in challenges based on  voters' race, ethnicity or English-language skills.</p>
<p>   Nearly 50 Asian Americans were selectively challenged at the  polls as ineligible to vote in a majority-white, Alabama village  in August 2004. A Vietnamese American was running for office  there. According to his Anglo opponent, &quot;we figured if they  couldn't speak good English, they possibly weren't American  citizens.&quot;</p>
<p>   Native American voters were prevented from voting in South  Dakota's June 2004 primary after they were asked to provide photo  IDs, which were not required under state or federal law.</p>
<p>   Voters in African-American neighborhoods in Philadelphia were  systematically challenged in 2004 by men carrying clipboards and  driving sedans with magnetic signs designed to look like law  enforcement insignia.</p>

<p>   Partisans in Atkinson County, Georgia obtained a list of  Latino registered voters in 2004, and then used it to challenge  95 of the 121 people listed.</p>
<p>   The Ohio Republican party challenged approximately 35,000  registered voters from predominantly urban and minority areas in  late October 2004.</p>
<p>   Widespread challenges to voters' credentials in a current,  razor-thin Westchester Co., NY senate race have prompted  allegations that communities of color are being targeted.</p>
<p>   Partisan operatives often resort to &quot;dirty tricks&quot; in order to  depress the votes of the opposing party.</p>
<p>   Over 4,000 potential voters in Florida's Leon Co., all  students at Florida State and Florida A &amp; M universities,  discovered that their party registrations had been switched to  Republican and their addresses changed in 2004.</p>

<p>   Kerry-Edwards campaign workers in Marion Co., Ohio were  accused of making misleading phone calls in five Ohio counties in  2004, directing voters to cast ballots at the wrong polling  place.</p>
<p>   State agencies have been known to abuse their authority in  ways that can suppress the votes of identifiable communities.</p>
<p>   Florida was forced to abandon a purge of potential felons from  its voter rolls in 2004 after a news report revealed that the  removal list included thousands of eligible, primarily African- American voters.</p>
<p>   Students at Prairie View A &amp; M University in Texas, a  predominantly African-American school, were erroneously  challenged as ineligible to vote in local elections by the Waller  County district attorney in 2004.</p>
<p>   ---</p>

<p>   The Remedy:</p>
<p>   Ongoing voter intimidation and vote suppression reflect the  inadequacy of current legal standards and enforcement. States and  the federal government must adopt vigorous policies and  procedures for preventing these abuses.</p>
<p>   1. Arizona, Wisconsin and Missouri have embraced model  policies that can help outlaw voter intimidation and vote  suppression. They variously prohibit attempts to intimidate  voters, the spreading of false information about elections, and  efforts to deceive people about the time, place, or manner of  elections or voter qualifications. MN and WA also regulate  challenges to peoples' voter eligibility.</p>
<p>   2. Legislation introduced in 2005 by U.S. Senator Barak Obama  (D-Ill.), the Deceptive Practices and Voter Intimidation  Prevention Act, would enhance the investigation of deceptive  practices, establish harsh penalties for those found to have  perpetrated them, and establish a process for providing full and  accurate information to misinformed and intimidated voters.</p>
<p>   &quot;States can take several clear steps to ensure that all  eligible voters are afforded fair and full access to the voting  booth, and they can start by imposing meaningful penalties on  those who would suppress and intimidate the electorate,&quot; said  Brenda Wright, Managing Attorney at the National Voting Rights  Institute, an affiliate of Demos. &quot;We need to get tough on those  who attempt to abridge the voting rights of their fellow  citizens.&quot;</p>

<p>   (Previously published briefing papers in this series have  examined issues that include: voter ID/ proof of citizenship  requirements/fraud allegations; provisional ballots; ballot  access for disabled and language-minority voters; felony  disfranchisement laws; poll worker training; and the National  Voter Registration Act. Upcoming publications will examine: name  matching and voter registration databases; campaign finance; and  Election Day registration.)</p>
