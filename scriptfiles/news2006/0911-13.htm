<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">NEW YORK - September 11 - In a <span class="media_outlet">New York Times</span> article (<a href="http://www.democracyinaction.org/dia/track.jsp?key=183956116&url_num=16&url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/05/washington/05cnd-bush.html"  target="_blank" title="">9/6/06</a>)
on George W. Bush's September 5 speech concerning terrorism and Iraq,
reporters David Sanger and John O'Neil included a striking revision of
Bush's reasoning for going to war:</font></p>
<blockquote>
<div class="sideindent">
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span class="published-content-body">The possibility that Saddam Hussein might
develop 'weapons of mass destruction' and pass them to terrorists was
the prime reason Mr. Bush gave in 2003 for ordering the invasion of
Iraq.<br>
</span></font></p>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><span class="published-content-body">
Of course, the drive to war rested firmly on Bush's repeated and
emphatic claim that Hussein had already developed WMDs, which he
possessed and was prepared to use—a bogus claim that the mainstream media,
led by the <span class="media_outlet">Times</span>'
own Judith Miller, largely accepted as an article of faith and
bolstered with credulous reports based on faulty information. (See <span class="media_outlet">Extra!</span>, <a href="http://www.democracyinaction.org/dia/track.jsp?key=183956116&url_num=17&url=http://www.fair.org/index.php?page=1150"  title="">7-8/03</a>.) <br>
<br>
Bush's charges that Iraq concealed chemical and biological weapons were
unequivocal. "Iraq has stockpiled biological and chemical weapons, and
is rebuilding the facilities used to make more of those weapons," Bush
told the U.N. (9/12/02). <br>
<br>
"The Iraqi regime . . . possesses and produces chemical and biological
weapons. It is seeking nuclear weapons," Bush said in a speech in
Cincinnati (10/7/02). "We've also discovered through intelligence that
Iraq has a growing fleet of manned and unmanned aerial vehicles that
could be used to disperse chemical or biological weapons across broad
areas."<br>
<br>
"Intelligence gathered by this and other governments leaves no doubt
that the Iraq regime continues to possess and conceal some of the most
lethal weapons ever devised," Bush said in a March 17, 2003 address to
the nation.<br>
<br>
The <span class="media_outlet">New York Times</span>' editorial
page unskeptically accepted these claims and incorporated them into the
paper's own arguments. In a September 18, 2002 editorial, the paper
declared: <br>
</span></font></p>
<blockquote>
<div class="sideindent">
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span class="published-content-body">What really counts in this conflict...is the
destruction of Iraq's unconventional weapons and the dismantling of its
program to develop nuclear arms.... What makes Iraq the subject of
intense concern, as Mr. Bush noted, is Mr. Hussein's defiance of the
Security Council's longstanding instructions to dismantle Baghdad's
nuclear weapons program and to eliminate all its biological and
chemical weapons and the materials used to make them.<br>
</span></font></p>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><span class="published-content-body">
<br>
After the U.N. Security Council passed a resolution on inspectors returning to Iraq, the <span class="media_outlet">Times</span> editorialized (11/9/02): <br>
</span></font></p>
<blockquote>
<div class="sideindent">
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span class="published-content-body">The unwavering goal is to disarm Iraq,
enforcing a string of previous Security Council resolutions that
Baghdad has contemptuously ignored. The cost of letting that happen has
been diminished authority for the United Nations and a growing danger
that Iraq's unconventional weapons will be used in war or passed on to
terrorists. Mr. Bush has galvanized the Security Council to declare
that its orders must now be obeyed and those dangers eliminated.</span></font></p>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><span class="published-content-body"> <br>
When the inspectors returned, the paper stated (12/6/02), "Iraq has to
get rid of its biological and chemical arms and missiles and the means
to make them, and abandon its efforts to develop nuclear weapons." When
the inspectors failed to find any evidence of banned weapons, the <span class="media_outlet">Times</span> insisted (2/15/03): "The Security Council doesn't need to sit through
more months of inconclusive reports. It needs full and immediate Iraqi
disarmament. It needs to say so, backed by the threat of military
force." <br>
<br>
As the invasion approached, the editorialists endorsed (3/13/03)
British Prime Minister Tony Blair's six-point ultimatum to Iraq as the "last hope of forcing Saddam Hussein to disarm voluntarily." The first
point: "Mr. Hussein would have to acknowledge that he has hidden
unconventional weapons and pledge to stop producing or concealing such
weapons."<br>
 <br>
The <span class="media_outlet">New York Times</span>'
revision of the record, maintaining that Bush only presented Iraqi WMDs
as a "possibility," threatens to erase one of the most significant
chapters of recent history, in effect clearing the Bush
administration—and the <span class="media_outlet">Times</span>—of their role in misleading the country into war.<br>
