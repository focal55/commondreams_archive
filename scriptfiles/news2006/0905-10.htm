<p>WASHINGTON - September 5 - A new study released today by the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS) details a massive breakdown of security at the South Texas Project nuclear power plant near Houston, Texas. 
<p>According to the report, vehicles enter protected areas of the reactor unsearched, surveillance cameras don't work, and the cleaning staff has easy access to firearms. Security officers at the nuclear plant have alerted supervisors to these problems only to have their concerns ignored and the supervisors retaliate against them. 

<p>"The security officers at the South Texas Project are the first line of defense against terrorist attacks on this nuclear plant," said Dave Lochbaum, Director of the Nuclear Safety Project at UCS. "For too long, security officers have raised concerns about ineffective drills, deficient security posts and equipment, improper access controls, and unmitigated vulnerabilities through proper channels. Too often, their concerns only resulted in retaliation." 

<p>Security is provided at the plant by Wackenhut, a private security firm. UCS reviewed an extensive paper trail demonstrating that security officers at the plant have become targets for retaliation despite good faith efforts to fix the safety problems. The NRC must promptly investigate these concerns and insure all vulnerabilities are corrected. Congressman Edward Markey formally asked the NRC Chairman to investigate the matter and report back with the agency's findings. 

<p>"As long as these problems go unfixed, the public's safety is at risk," said Lochbaum. "Fortunately for the community around the South Texas Project plant, the security officers take their jobs too seriously to remain silent about lax security at their nuclear power plant. They should receive accolades, not harassment."
