<p>WASHINGTON  - November 2 - As the political  landscape shifts and more Republican races become competitive,  more than 80,000 MoveOn.org Political Action members are making 5  million phone calls to Democratic &quot;drop-off&quot; and Independent  voters. The members are mobilizing voters in the nation's most  competitive House and Senate races in order to increase  Democratic performance at the polls on Election Day.</p>
<p>   Call for Change is a &quot;liquid&quot; program. In the past week,  several races including MO-Sen, VA-Sen, NC-08, PA-04 and NY-25  were added to MoveOn's list of races where MoveOn members make  GOTV calls. &quot;On Oct. 19 we saw a poll that showed Tim Walz was  closing the gap. Within a few days, calls were pouring into  Minnesota's first district. That's what makes our program  'liquid,'&quot; said Eli Pariser, executive director of MoveOn.org  Political Action. </p>
<p>   Over 2.6 million calls have already been made -- including  over 138,000 Wednesday night alone. While many MoveOn members  call from the comfort of their own homes, the organization has  opened 39 campaign offices throughout the country. At each of  these offices, members who live in the area will make thousands  of phone calls through Election Day aimed at defeating the  Republican Congress.</p>
<p>   To see the &quot;Call for Change&quot; program, visit:  <a href="http://releases.usnewswire.com/redir.asp?ReleaseID=75588&Link=http://pol.moveon.org/nov06/practicegotv/call.html">http://pol.moveon.org/nov06/practicegotv/call.html</a> Log-In:  <a href="http://releases.usnewswire.com/redir.asp?ReleaseID=75588&Link=&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;&#58;&#106;&#111;&#117;&#114;&#110;&#97;&#108;&#105;&#115;&#116;&#115;&#64;&#101;&#108;&#105;&#112;&#97;&#114;&#105;&#115;&#101;&#114;&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;">&#106;&#111;&#117;&#114;&#110;&#97;&#108;&#105;&#115;&#116;&#115;&#64;&#101;&#108;&#105;&#112;&#97;&#114;&#105;&#115;&#101;&#114;&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;</a> / Password: journalist</p>
<p>   MoveOn's one-of-a-kind &quot;Call for Change&quot; technology allows  regular people to log onto <a href="http://releases.usnewswire.com/redir.asp?ReleaseID=75588&Link=http://www.callforchange.org">http://www.callforchange.org</a> and use  their home computers and phones to call targeted voters. MoveOn  utilizes consumer data and other &quot;micro-targeting&quot; methods to  ensure that millions of voter mobilization calls go to Democrats  and like-minded Independents who are infrequent voters.</p>
<p>   &quot;I'm so very grateful to Call for Change for affording me the  opportunity to serve in the democratic process,&quot; said Susan  Eppley User, a MoveOn member in Decatur, Ga. &quot;As a single working  mom of two girls under the age of six, I have very little time or  money to dedicate to my civic duty. The calling was easy, it  didn't take much time,&quot; User concluded.</p>
<p>   The organization projects over 80,000 members will make 5  million phone calls this election cycle-including over 802,050  calls on Nov. 7. Members will host nearly 4000 &quot;Call for Change&quot;  house parties this weekend and on Election Day.</p>
<p>   The offices are located in 25 states, including Arizona,  California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Illinois,  Indiana, Iowa, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Missouri,  Montana, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon,  Pennsylvania, Texas, Virginia, Washington State, Washington, D.C.  and Wisconsin. These offices will target vulnerable races  including Rep. Nancy Johnson (CT-5), Rep. Deborah Pryce (OH-15),  Rep. Thelma Drake (VA-02) and Rep. Chris Shays (CT-4)</p>
<p>   -- Media are invited to cover activities at these offices --  or this weekend's house parties. For exact locations, please call  Trevor Fitzgibbon at 202-246-5303 or Laura Gross and Alex Howe at  202-822-5200.</p>
<p>   The office locations were selected because thousands of MoveOn  members live in the selected areas and because the local  Republican incumbents are politically vulnerable due to  consistently voting for President Bush's failed agenda.</p>
<p>   &quot;It's time to end one-party Republican rule in Washington --  they've messed everything up,&quot; Pariser added. &quot;MoveOn has opened  39 offices in 25 states because we need to do everything we can  to hold the Bush Administration accountable and move America in a  new direction.&quot;</p>
<p>   Each office will implement the Call for Change phone program,  using cutting-edge targeting methods. Members will reach out to  Democrats and like-minded Independents who are infrequent voters  -- such as new registrants or those who voted in past  presidential elections but not congressional elections. Each  voter will get up to three phone calls: one in October, another  the weekend before the election, and a third on Election Day --  totaling 5 million calls nationally by Election Day.</p>
<p>   The program was tested in a special election in April and a  recent study reviewed by the nation's foremost scholar of voter  turnout shows these targeted calls boosted voter turnout more  than any volunteer phone bank ever studied.</p>
