<p>WASHINGTON - July 14 - In the midst of dramatically increasing violence in Iraq and the Middle East, as well as rising tensions with Iran and North Korea, Reps. Lynn Woolsey (D-CA) and John Conyers (D-MI) will join peace movement icon Tom Hayden in speaking to the 18th National Congress of Peace Action, to be held this weekend, July 14-16, at Wayne State University in Detroit, Michigan. All three are available for media interviews.
<p>Rep. Woolsey is a founder of the “Out of Iraq” caucus in the U.S. House of Representatives, the first member to offer legislation on troop withdrawal, and a strong advocate for non-proliferation. She will be giving a keynote speech at 1:30pm on Saturday, July 15 in Manoogian Hall (Warren and John C. Lodge Freeway).
<p>Rep. Conyers is a founder of the Congressional Black Caucus, a supporter of legislation to end the war in Iraq, and as ranking member of the House Judiciary Committee has been a leader in demanding accountability from the White House on the pre-war intelligence and justification for the Iraq war. He will be speaking and receiving a Lifetime Achievement Award immediately after Rep. Woolsey’s speech on Saturday.
<p>Tom Hayden was a founder of the Students for a Democratic Society, one of the seminal organizations of the “New Left” in the 1960s. He went on to become a California state legislator, and most recently a noted speaker, author, and analyst of U.S. foreign policy. He will be giving a keynote speech at 7:30pm on Friday, July 14 in General Lectures Hall (Warren and Anthony Wayne Drive).
<p>Media are invited to attend these sessions. To schedule interviews at other times, please call the Peace Action contacts at the numbers above.
