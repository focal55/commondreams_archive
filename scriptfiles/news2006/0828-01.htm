<p>WASHINGTON - August 28 -
<p>   WHEN: 11 a.m. PST, Monday, Aug. 28</p>
<p>   WHO: Jamie Court, president, Foundation for Taxpayer and  Consumer Rights (FTCR)</p>
<p>   WHERE: FTCR Offices, 1750 Ocean Park Blvd., Suite 200 Santa  Monica, Calif.</p>
<p>   Consumer advocate Jamie Court will call on state and federal  regulators to respond to an investigation by the Kansas City Star  that found oil companies' failure to install fuel pumps that  adjust for temperature costs Californians at least 3 cents for  every gallon in warmer weather. When the temperature of gasoline  rises above 60 degrees, the gasoline expands but pumps don't  account for the bigger volume and consumers receive less gasoline  than they should. The technology to adjust for temperature has  already been installed in Canada but domestic oil companies have  resisted because they made at least an extra $500 million in  profits per year in California due to failure to adjust for  gasoline temperature. Hawaii is the only state to adjust its  pumps for hotter gas.</p>
<p>   FTCR President Jamie Court will call for installation of  temperature sensitive pumps nationally and ask Gov.  Schwarzenegger to remove a top California official responsible  for defending the oil industry's current technology. Court will  point to Schwarzenegger's receipt of more than $2 million in oil  company contributions as reason for the governor to appoint a new  independent regulator and call for new pump technology.</p>
