<p>NEW YORK  - March 8 - Today attorneys with the Center for Constitutional Rights (CCR) responded to reports that Republican Senators reached an “accord” with the White House on proposed legislation to allow more warrantless domestic spying on Americans.  Legal Director Bill Goodman, a member of the legal team that filed CCR’s challenge to the NSA Program (CCR v. Bush), released this statement today:

 

<ul>“The NSA Domestic Spying Program violates the Constitution, and no backroom Republican deals can change the program’s illegality.  President Bush admitted to spying on Americans without warrants – in violation of the First and Fourth Amendments of the Constitution and federal law.  President Bush tried to use this illegal program to secretly grab power far beyond his Constitutional authority, and we are fighting his illegal actions in court.  

 

</ul><ul><p>The Administration hid the very existence of the illegal NSA Program from Congress and the public for over four years, and since it was revealed in December the Administration has refused to explain even its basic details – like how many Americans have been illegally spied upon.  There is no way Congress can legitimately pass more legislation on domestic spying until it: addresses the Administration’s past illegal conduct; holds officials who broke the law accountable; fully investigates the NSA Program; and hears public testimony from all the officials in President Bush’s Justice Department who challenged the program’s legality.

 

</ul><ul><p>We will continue our efforts to challenge the President’s illegal spying in federal court, and Congress must take action on the NSA Program’s illegality before it rushes to make deals for more warrantless spying on Americans.”
</ul>
 

<p>CCR is currently challenging the NSA Program in court (CCR v. Bush), and it has a long and effective record of protecting constitutional rights endangered by illegal Presidential actions.  CCR helped terminate illegal wiretapping by the Nixon Administration and brought the landmark 1972 Supreme Court decision establishing the illegality of warrantless domestic surveillance (United States v. United States District Court).
