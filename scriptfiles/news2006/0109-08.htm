<p>DETROIT, Michigan - January 9 - The national American Civil Liberties Union and the American Civil 
Liberties Union of Michigan appeared today before the U.S. Supreme Court to 
argue that police should not be able to use evidence found in a home if the 
officers did not meet the &#8220;knock and announce&#8221; requirement and therefore entered 
the home illegally. The ACLU is representing Booker T. Hudson, a Michigan 
homeowner. </P>
<P>&#8220;It&#8217;s undisputed that the police violated the Fourth Amendment by barging 
into Mr. Hudson&#8217;s home without &#8216;knocking and announcing,&#8217;&#8221; said David A. Moran, 
Assistant Professor at Wayne State University Law School and the ACLU 
cooperating attorney who argued the case before the Court. &#8220;The question is 
whether evidence should be suppressed in order to deter the police from 
violating the &#8216;knock and announce&#8217; requirement.&#8221;</P>
<P>According to the ACLU, Detroit police broke into Hudson&#8217;s home without 
knocking and announcing, as required by law.&nbsp; Once inside, the police found 
a small quantity of drugs and arrested Hudson for possession, which caused him 
to be placed on probation for eighteen months.&nbsp; Hudson's legal attempt to 
suppress the evidence found in his home on the basis of the &#8220;knock and announce&#8221; 
violation was denied because of a 1999 Michigan Supreme Court ruling that 
evidence found after such a violation was not eligible for suppression. </P>
<P>In a 1995 U.S. Supreme Court opinion Justice Clarence Thomas, writing for the 
Court, stressed that the &#8220;knock and announce&#8221; requirement protects the dignity 
of residents by allowing them a reasonable time to make themselves presentable 
before the police enter, and also protects private property by allowing 
residents an opportunity to open their door instead of having the doors 
destroyed by a police battering ram.&nbsp; <BR>&nbsp;<BR>&#8220;There is good reason 
for the 'knock and announce' requirement,&#8221; said Kary Moss, ACLU of Michigan 
Executive Director.&nbsp; &#8220;The courts have always placed a high priority on the 
rights of people within their own homes and the Michigan practice makes it too 
easy to completely disregard those rights.&nbsp; In our argument today we urge 
the Supreme Court to not allow policy to violate those rights with impunity.&#8221;&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;<BR>This issue has been disputed in courts across the 
country, but the Michigan Supreme Court&#8217;s position has been rejected by the 
highest state courts in Arkansas and Maryland and by the Sixth and Eighth 
Circuit Courts of Appeal. The Michigan Supreme Court's holding has been embraced 
by only the Seventh Circuit.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>A decision in <EM>Hudson v. Michigan</EM> is 
expected by June 2006. </P>
<P>In addition to Moran and Moss, Hudson is represented by Steven R. Shapiro of 
the national ACLU, Michael Steinberg of the ACLU of Michigan, Timothy O&#8217;Toole 
and Richard D. Korn. </P>
