<p>WASHINGTON - January 30 - The National Committee for Responsive Philanthropy 
            (NCRP) today decries the exclusion of Abramoff-type abuse of 
            foundations and nonprofits from the gamut of lobbying reform 
            legislation being debated on Capitol Hill. 
<P>"These legislative efforts ignore largely untraceable loopholes, 
            which if neglected in this round of lobbying reform, would leave the 
            charitable sector, Congress, and K Street ripe for more abuse and 
            illegal behavior," said Rick Cohen, executive director of NCRP. "The 
            Abramoff affair should be a clarion call to prevent politicians, 
            their campaign staff, and their K Street cronies from cloaking dirty 
            dealings behind charity and philanthropy," he continued. 
<P>The political abuse of charities&#8217; tax-exempt status erodes the 
            public&#8217;s trust in government as well as in the charitable sector, 
            two entities that have been charged to be fiscally responsible and 
            straightforward with public dollars. NCRP urges Congress to ensure 
            that comprehensive lobbying reform includes regulation and 
            disclosure of lobbyists&#8217; and politicians&#8217; charitable activities. 
            Immediate steps must be taken to expose the political misuse of 
            foundations, to improve the ethical workings of the lawmaking 
            process and restore trust in Congress, and to prevent future abuse 
            and mitigate the growing public distrust of the nation&#8217;s nonprofit 
            sector. 
<P>Based on NCRP&#8217;s monitoring of the Abramoff case (and others), we 
            call on lawmakers to incorporate into any and all legislation that 
            deals with lobbying reform the following: 
<UL>
              <LI><B>Full disclosure of donors and grants.</B> Any foundation or 
              charity established by or connected to members of Congress should 
              be required to disclose the source of its donations as well as a 
              detailed account of expenditures. Under federal law, the names of 
              donors to charities are protected from the public, but that rule 
              should not apply to tax-exempt groups founded by or affiliated 
              with lawmakers. Members of the House and Senate, even after 
              leaving public office, make and influence policy decisions that 
              affect every citizen; therefore, the public has a right to know 
              fully the interactions of politicians with lobbyists, especially 
              under the cover of nonprofits. 
              <P></P>
              <LI><B>Tighter ethics rules to govern lawmakers.</B> The growth in 
              the number of charities that operate as political fronts stems 
              from the 2003 repeal of a rule that barred House of 
              Representatives members from accepting reimbursement for travel 
              and lodging expenses in connection with charity events. Under the 
              current standards, lawmakers and their families can participate in 
              charity fundraising events without disclosing how much money they 
              or their charity receive. These standards allow for lobbyists to 
              buy face time and access to these lawmakers. 
              <P></P>
              <LI><B>Increased dollars for Internal Revenue Service oversight 
              and enforcement.</B> Many nonprofit leaders have urged state and 
              federal governments to step up enforcement of tax-exempt law, but 
              too few have done anything to press for more money to be channeled 
              to regulators. Now more than ever, the foundation excise tax needs 
              to be used for its original purpose: funding government oversight 
              of the tax-exempt sector. 
              <P></P>
              <LI><B>Better disclosure of financial transactions and donor 
              records among different types of nonprofit organizations (c3s, 
              c4s, 527s).</B> </LI></UL>
            <P>Cohen&#8217;s article in <I>Responsive Philanthropy</I>&#8217;s Fall 2004 
            issue, "Abramoff: Well- Connected to the Well-Heeled of the Right," 
            was one of the first to bring to light to Jack Abramoff&#8217;s abuse of 
            his Capital Athletic Foundation as a tool to funnel money from 
            various interest groups, including Native American tribes, to 
            himself, his colleagues and business partners, and prominently 
ranked lawmakers on Capitol Hill.<!-- #EndEditable -->
