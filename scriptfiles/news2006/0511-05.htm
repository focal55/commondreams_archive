<p>WASHINGTON - May 11 - The American 
Civil Liberties Union today decried Congress&#8217;s failure to support legislation 
that would have made emergency contraception available at all military health 
care facilities.&nbsp; In 2002, the 
Department of Defense removed the safe and effective contraceptive from its 
Basic Core Formulary, making it much less likely that the drug will be stocked 
on military bases.</P>
<P>&#8220;At 
a time when we are expecting so much from our women servicemembers, we must do 
everything we can to meet their basic health care needs,&#8221; said Caroline 
Fredrickson, Director of the ACLU Washington Legislative Office.&nbsp; &#8220;Making sure that military women can get 
emergency contraception will go a long way to meeting the important public 
health goal of reducing the number of unintended pregnancies and the need for 
abortion.&#8221; </P>
<P>In 
2002, the Department of Defense recognized the importance of making emergency 
contraception available to military women when it made the drug available by 
prescription at military health facilities.&nbsp; However, according to a recent press 
report, department officials removed, without explanation, the contraceptive 
from its Basic Core Formulary after only one month. </P>
<P>Yesterday, the ACLU, joined 
a broad coalition of women in the military, medical professionals, and advocates 
for women&#8217;s health and rights, and sent a joint letter urging members of 
Congress to support an amendment to the Fiscal Year 2007 National Defense 
Authorization Act (H.R. 5122) sponsored by Representatives Michael Michaud 
(D-ME) and Tim Ryan (D-OH).&nbsp; The 
Michaud-Ryan Amendment would have ensured that emergency contraception was again 
available by prescription at all military health facilities.&nbsp; Yesterday, the amendment was blocked in 
a House committee.</P>
<P>The 
letter pointed out that &#8220;increased access to emergency contraception will help 
meet the needs of those military women who are victims of sexual assault.&nbsp;&nbsp; A 2003 study found that 30 percent 
of female U.S. military veterans report having been raped or suffered a rape 
attempt during their military service, and military officials report that there 
were 2,374 reported cases of sexual assault among service members reported to 
military criminal investigators last year &#8211; a 40 percent increase from 2004.&#8221; </P>
<P>In 
addition to the ACLU, signatories to the letter include: The Miles Foundation, 
an organization that provides comprehensive services to victims of violence 
associated with the military, the American Jewish Committee, the National 
Association for Nurse Practitioners in Women&#8217;s Health, and the National Latina 
Institute for Reproductive Health.</P>
<P>&#8220;A 
military woman facing the tragedy of a sexual assault must not be twice 
victimized,&#8221; Fredrickson said.&nbsp; 
&#8220;Ensuring that she can get emergency contraception will enable her to 
prevent a pregnancy that could result form an assault; this is the least we can 
do.&#8221;</P>
<P>Major medical groups, 
including the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the American 
Medical Association, and the American Public Health Association, have all 
supported making emergency contraception more readily 
available.</P>
<P>Emergency contraception, 
often referred to as &#8220;the morning after pill,&#8221; prevents pregnancy after 
unprotected sex or contraceptive failure.&nbsp; 
This safe and effective birth control reduces the risk of pregnancy by as 
much as 89 percent if the first dose is taken within days of unprotected 
intercourse, but it is more effective the sooner it is taken. </P>
