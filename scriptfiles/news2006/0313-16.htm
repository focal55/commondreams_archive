<p>WASHINGTON - March 13 - Today, MoveOn Media Action Director Noah T. Winer congratulated The McClatchy Co. on its purchase of Knight Ridder Inc. and urged renewed commitment to strong watchdog journalism. 

 

<p>“We congratulate McClatchy on their purchase of Knight Ridder and remind them that there’s a right way and a wrong way to improve profits,” said Winer. “When the Tribune Company forced local newspapers to slash newspaper staff and abandon quality journalism, readers across the country rebelled. The right way to make profit is to engage in strong watchdog journalism – giving reporters the resources they need to dig for the truth, ask tough questions, and deliver real news that the public actually wants to buy and read. Wall Street may try to squeeze every penny from newspapers, but that’s a recipe for long-term financial disaster since customers will jump ship if the real stories aren’t covered.”

 

<p>Recently, MoveOn Media Action mobilized tens of thousands of readers against the Tribune Company’s decision to abandon quality journalism by slashing 800 newspaper jobs at 8 newspapers across the nation – spreading reporters too thin, and hurting their ability to practice strong watchdog journalism. MoveOn Media Action confronted Tribune CEO Dennis FitzSimons with petition signatures from 45,000 of his own customers opposing the news cuts during the Credit Suisse First Boston Media Week conference in New York.

<p>MoveOn Media Action is a project of MoveOn.org Civic Action – a 501(c)(4) distinct from MoveOn’s political action committee. MoveOn Media Action empowers regular people to reform the media and fight back when news organizations abandon their duty to practice strong watchdog journalism. It was formed because MoveOn members felt this was an important priority for the organization.
