<p>WASHINGTON - April 20 - <span class="BEX">Thirteen environmental and public health organizations are urging the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee to oppose the confirmation of William Wehrum to be Assistant Administrator for the Office of Air and Radiation at the Environmental Protection Agency &#40;EPA&#41;. The committee is expected to vote on his confirmation Wednesday, April 26.</span>
<p><span class="BEX">In a letter to all the members of the committee, the groups say Wehrum &quot;should not be entrusted with the responsibilities&quot; of that office because &quot;he has played a central role in developing and defending air pollution policies that weaken critical public health and environmental protection.&quot;</span></p>

<p><span class="BEX">For a copy of the letter, click </span><a href="http://docs.nrdc.org/legislation/leg_06042002a.pdf">here</a>.</p>

<p><span class="BEX">The letter was signed by the following groups: Citizens for Pennsylvania's Future, Environmental Integrity Project, Friends of the Earth, Global Community Monitor, League of Conservation Voters, National Environmental Trust, Natural Resources Council of Maine, Natural Resources Defense Council &#40;NRDC&#41;, Our Children's Earth Foundation, Physicians for Social Responsibility, Sierra Club, U.S. Public Interest Research Group, and Union of Concerned Scientists.</span></p>
