WASHINGTON - February 13 - Under pressure 
              from a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit, the Justice Department 
              on February 10 conceded in federal court that it could begin releasing 
              as early as March 3 the internal legal memos relied on by the Bush 
              administration in setting up the controversial National Security 
              Agency warrantless wiretapping program.</p>
            <p>The National Security Archive, along with the American Civil Liberties 
              Union (&quot;ACLU&quot;), this week joined the Electronic Privacy 
              Information Center in a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit against 
              the Department of Justice seeking to compel the immediate disclosure 
              of the internal legal justifications for the surveillance program. 
              The <a href="http://www.gwu.edu/%7Ensarchiv/news/20060213/Complaint.pdf" target="_blank">filing this 
              week by the Archive and the ACLU</a> was <a href="http://www.gwu.edu/%7Ensarchiv/news/20060213/Motion.Consolidate.pdf" target="_blank">consolidated</a> 
              with a suit <a href="http://www.gwu.edu/%7Ensarchiv/news/20060213/EPIC_complaint_doj.pdf">filed on January 
              19, 2006, by the Electronic Privacy Information Center (&quot;EPIC&quot;)</a> 
              that requested the federal court in Washington <a href="http://www.gwu.edu/%7Ensarchiv/news/20060213/EPIC_pi_motion_doj.pdf" target="_blank">to 
              issue a preliminary injunction</a> requiring the release 
              of relevant documents within 20 days-which Judge Henry H. Kennedy, 
              Jr. considered at a formal hearing today. </p>
            <p> The response of the news media to the revelation that the National 
              Security Agency (&quot;NSA&quot;) has engaged in warrantless domestic 
              surveillance was immediate and dramatic, as was the response of 
              Congress which just this week held the first hearing examining the 
              legality of the program. News reporting and Administration statements 
              over the last six weeks have disclosed that NSA began warrantless 
              eavesdropping prior to receiving formal approval from President 
              Bush; that the operation involves cooperation from American telecommunication 
              companies, which allowed the agency to tap &quot;directly into some 
              of the American telecommunication system's main arteries&quot;; 
              that the information gathered was turned over to other agencies, 
              including the Defense Intelligence Agency; and that some purely 
              domestic communications (which both originated and terminated in 
              the United States) were accidentally intercepted. </p>
            <p> The Archive's General Counsel Meredith Fuchs commented, &quot;There 
              are real secrets and convenient secrets. It may be convenient for 
              the NSA to run this program in secret, but that policy debate, and 
              consideration of the legality of the program, should be open.&quot; 
            </p>
            <p> The Archive submitted the FOIA request to the Department of Justice 
              on December 22, 2005. The Department of Justice agreed with the 
              Archive's contention that the request merits speedy processing, 
              but has failed to meet FOIA's statutory 20-day deadline for responses.</p>
            <p> The Archive has published an <a href="http://www.gwu.edu/%7Ensarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB178/index.htm">extensive 
              chronicle of the key historic documents about domestic intelligence 
              policy</a>, including many brought to light by the Church 
              Committee investigations of intelligence abuses, and a series of 
              National Security Agency documents from the 1990s released under 
              the Freedom of Information Act that describe the limits imposed 
by FISA and the Fourth Amendment on surveilling U.S. persons.<!-- #EndEditable -->
