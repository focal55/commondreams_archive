<p>WASHINGTON - February 1 - Calling for an &#x201C;overhaul&#x201D; of New York State&#x2019;s ethics laws, a coalition of civic groups urged Governor Pataki and New York&#x2019;s legislative leaders to embrace a package of reforms unveiled today.  The Brennan Center for Justice at NYU School of Law, Common Cause/NY, the League of Women Voters/N.Y.S. and the New York Public Interest Research Group (NYPIRG) released an <a href="../../programs/downloads/Final%20ethics%20report.pdf">analysis of New York&#x2019;s laws regulating ethics and lobbying</a> that proposed a series of reforms for New York based on reforms adopted by other states.
<p>In a <a href="http://www.brennancenter.org/programs/downloads/DearLegislatorsltr1-29-06.pdf">letter to the Governor and the leaders of both the Senate and Assembly</a>, the groups urged action on their proposal to close numerous current loopholes, expand the reach of existing ethics rules without burdening public officials with needless paperwork, and strengthen ethics enforcement. Covering 8 areas of reform, the proposal would, among other things:



<p>
<ol>
<li>Establish an independent state ethics commission with jurisdiction over statewide elected officials,
state officers and employees, legislators, and legislative employees.</li>
<li>Limit contributions from public contractors and lobbyists to end the “pay-to-play” practices of Albany. </li>
<li>Ban gifts to elected officials, state officers or employees, and candidates for those offices, with 
limited exceptions for de minimis items.</li>
<li>Ban honoraria paid to public officials, except those paid for private professional services at the rate 
charged by specialists in the relevant field.</li>
<li>Strengthen ban on use of campaign contributions for personal use.</li>
<li>Strengthen “revolving door” bans by extending them to political party officials and lengthening the 
period of prohibition for lobbying by legislative employees. </li>
<li>Improve existing financial disclosure requirements for public officers.</li>
<li>Require ethics training for lobbyists, the governor, legislators, legislative employees, and state agency officers and employees.</li>
</ol>
