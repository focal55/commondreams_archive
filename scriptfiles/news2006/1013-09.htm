<p>WASHINGTON / REYKJAVIK - October 13 - 
          President Ronald Reagan 
                and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev almost achieved a deal 20 
                years ago at the 1986 Reykjavik summit to abolish nuclear weapons, 
                but the agreement would have required &quot;an exceptional level 
                of trust&quot; that neither side had yet developed, according 
                to previously secret U.S. and Soviet documents posted today on 
                the Web by the National Security Archive of George Washington 
                University and presented on October 12 in Reykjavik directly to 
                Gorbachev and the president of Iceland</p>
              <p>The documents include Gorbachev's 
                initial letter to Reagan from 15 September 1986 asking for &quot;a 
                quick one-on-one meeting, let us say in Iceland or in London,&quot; 
                newly translated Gorbachev discussions with his aides and with 
                the Politburo preparing for the meeting, U.S. Secretary of State 
                George Shultz's briefing book for the summit, the complete U.S. 
                and Soviet transcripts of the Reykjavik summit, and the internal 
                recriminations and reflections by both sides after the meeting 
                failed to reach agreement.</p>
              <p>Archive director Thomas Blanton, 
                Archive director of Russia programs Dr. Svetlana Savranskaya, 
                and Pulitzer-Prize-winning biographer Dr. William Taubman presented 
                the documents to Gorbachev at a state dinner in the residence 
                of President Olafur Ragnar Grimsson of Iceland on October 12 marking 
                the 20th anniversary of the summit, which Grimsson commented had 
                put Iceland on the map as a meeting place for international dialogue.</p>
              <p>The documents show that U.S. analysis 
                of Gorbachev's goals for the summit completely missed the Soviet 
                leader's emphasis on &quot;liquidation&quot; of nuclear weapons, 
                a dream Gorbachev shared with Reagan and which the two leaders 
                turned to repeatedly during the intense discussions at Reykjavik 
                in October 1986. But the epitaph for the summit came from Soviet 
                aide Gyorgy Arbatov, who at one point during staff discussions 
                told U.S. official Paul Nitze that the U.S. proposals (continued 
                testing of missile defenses in the Strategic Defense Initiative 
                or SDI while proceeding over 10 years to eliminate all ballistic 
                missiles, leading to the ultimate abolition of all offensive nuclear 
                weapons) would require &quot;an exceptional level of trust&quot; 
                and therefore &quot;we cannot accept your position.&quot;</font></p>
              <p>Politburo notes from October 30, 
                two weeks after the summit, show that Gorbachev by then had largely 
                accepted Reagan's formulation for further SDI research, but by 
                that point it was too late for a deal. The Iran-Contra scandal 
                was about to break, causing Reagan's approval ratings to plummet 
                and removing key Reagan aides like national security adviser John 
                Poindexter, whose replacement was not interested in the ambitious 
                nuclear abolition dreams the two leaders shared at Reykjavik. 
                The documents show that even the more limited notion of abolishing 
                ballistic missiles foundered on opposition from the U.S. military 
                which presented huge estimates of needed additional conventional 
                spending to make up for not having the missiles.</font></p>

                  the Reykjavik summit meeting when Gorbachev proposed &quot;a

                  summit. The English translation includes underlining by Reagan 
                  himself, who marked the sentence accusing the U.S. of deliberately 
                  finding a &quot;pretext&quot; to &quot;aggravate&quot; relations, 
                  and the two sentences about making &quot;no start&quot; on implementing

                  on arms reduction.&quot;</font></p>

                  the Soviet leadership about Reagan's decision to accept Gorbachev's 
                  invitation to meet in Reykjavik on the condition that 25 Soviet 
                  dissidents including Yury Orlov and Nicholas Daniloff, accused 
                  of spying, are released. Gorbachev accepts the conditions and 
                  sets forth his main ideas for the summit. The Soviet position, 
                  according to him, should be based on acceptance of U.S. security 
                  interests, otherwise negotiations would be unproductive. Gorbachev 
                  is aiming at a serious improvement in U.S.-Soviet relations.</font></p>

                <p>This briefing memo from Shultz

                  classified as &quot;Secret/Sensitive,&quot; shows that the U.S. 
                  did not expect any actual agreement at Reykjavik, but rather, 
                  mere preparations for a future summit in the U.S. Shultz talks 
                  here about ceilings on ballistic missiles but fails to predict 
                  Gorbachev's dramatic agreements to 50% cuts and a process leading 
                  to the abolition of nuclear weapons. Ironically, Shultz says 
                  one of the U.S. goals is to emphasize progress &quot;without 
                  permitting the impression that Reykjavik itself was a Summit,&quot; 
                  when history now sees Reykjavik as in many ways the most dramatic

                for Reykjavik, 4 October 1986, 5 pp.</font></p>
              <blockquote>
                <p>Gorbachev explains his top priorities 
                  and specific proposals to the group charged with preparing for 
                  Reykjavik. He calls for preparing a position with a &quot;breakthrough 
                  potential,&quot; which would take into account U.S. interests 
                  and put strategic weapons, not issues of nuclear testing, at 
                  the forefront. Gorbachev's ultimate goal for Reykjavik-he reiterates 
                  it several times during the meeting-is total liquidation of 
                  nuclear weapons based on the Soviet 15 January 1986 Program 
                  of Liquidation of Nuclear Weapons by the Year 2000. Whereas 
                  Gorbachev sees the value in making concessions in hopes of achieving 
                  a breakthrough, his Politburo colleagues (including Chebrikov) 
                  warn him against using this word in the negotiations. In the 
                  evening Gorbachev gives additional instructions to Chernyaev 
                  on human rights and on the matter of Gorbachev's wife, Raisa 
                  Maksimovna, accompanying him to Iceland.</font></p>

                  future U.S. summit, Gorbachev was already planning major concessions 
                  and breakthroughs. Far from having to &quot;smoke&quot; Gorbachev 
                  out during the talks, Reagan would be faced with an extraordinarily

                  for the Reykjavik agenda. Notable is the very first item on 
                  the latter, which presupposes that the best they will achieve 
                  is some agreement on a number of ballistic missile warheads 
                  between the U.S. proposal of 5500 and the Soviet proposal of 
                  6400, rather than the radical cuts that wound up on the table

              <blockquote>
                <p>In this last Politburo session 
                  before the delegation departed for Reykjavik, Gorbachev goes 
                  over the final details of the Soviet proposals. He allows for 
                  the possibility that the meeting could be a failure, and suggests 
                  making &quot;concessions on intermediate range missiles,&quot; 
                  and French and British nuclear weapons. Gorbachev believes there 
                  should be no &quot;intermediate&quot; positions or agreements, 
                  driving for his maximum program even if concessions would have 
                  to be made. Shevardnadze sounds most optimistic predicting that 
                  the U.S. side could agree with the Soviet non-withdrawal period 
                  on the Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) treaty and on 50% cuts of 
                  the nuclear triad (missiles, bombers, submarines) and intermediate-range 
                  missiles.</font></p>

              <blockquote>
                <p>This side-by-side presentation 
                  of the official U.S. transcripts of the Reykjavik summit meetings 
                  and the Soviet transcripts as published in Moscow in 1993 and 
                  translated by the U.S. government's Foreign Broadcast Information 
                  Service puts the reader inside the bullet-proof glass over the 
                  windows of Hofdi House as Reagan, Gorbachev, their translators, 
                  and their foreign ministers discuss radical changes in both 
                  U.S. and Soviet national security thinking.</font></p>
                <p>The two sets of transcripts are 
                  remarkably congruent, with each version providing slightly different 
                  wording and detail but no direct contradictions. Reagan and 
                  Gorbachev eloquently express their shared vision of nuclear 
                  abolition, and heatedly debate their widely divergent views 
                  of missile defenses. For Reagan, SDI was the ultimate insurance 
                  policy against a madman blackmailing the world with nuclear-tipped 
                  missiles in a future where all the superpowers' missiles and 
                  nuclear weapons had been destroyed. Reagan comes back again 
                  and again to the metaphor of keeping your gas masks even after 
                  banning chemical weapons, but Gorbachev feels as if Reagan is 
                  lecturing him, and says &quot;that's the 10th time you talked 
                  about gas masks.&quot;</font></p>
                <p>For Gorbachev, SDI was a U.S. 
                  attempt to take the arms race into space and potentially launch 
                  a first-strike attack on the Soviet Union - the ultimate nightmare 
                  for Soviet leaders seared into their consciousnesses by Hitler's 
                  blitzkrieg. But Gorbachev's scientists had already told him 
                  that missile defenses could be easily and cheaply countered 
                  with multiple warheads and decoys even if the defenses ever 
                  worked (which was unlikely).</font></p>
                <p>The great &quot;what if&quot; 
                  question suggested by the Reykjavik transcripts is what would 
                  have happened if Gorbachev had simply accepted Reagan's apparently 
                  sincere offer to share SDI technology rather than dismissing 
                  this as ridiculous when the U.S. would not even share &quot;milking 
                  machines.&quot; If Gorbachev had &quot;pocketed&quot; Reagan's 
                  offer, then the pressure would have been on the U.S. to deliver, 
                  in the face of a probable firestorm of opposition from the U.S. 
                  military and foreign policy establishment. Working in the opposite 
                  direction in favor of the deal would have been overwhelming 
                  public support for these dramatic changes, both in the U.S. 
                  and in the Soviet Union, and especially in Europe.</font></p>
                <p>Perhaps most evocative is the 
                  Russian version's closing words, which are not included in the 
                  U.S. transcript. This exchange comes after Reagan asks for a 
                  personal &quot;favor&quot; from Gorbachev of accepting the offer 
                  on SDI and ABM, and Gorbachev replies by saying this is not 
                  a favor but a matter of principle. The U.S. version has Reagan 
                  standing at that point to leave the room and a brief polite 
                  exchange about regards to Nancy Reagan. But the Russian version 
                  has Reagan saying, &quot;I think you didn't want to achieve 
                  an agreement anyway&quot; and &quot;I don't know when we'll 
                  ever have another chance like this and whether we will meet 
                  soon.&quot;</font></p>

              <blockquote>
                <p>In the all-night negotiations 
                  of Soviet and U.S. military experts during the middle of the 
                  Reykjavik summit, the Soviet delegation led by Marshal Sergei 
                  Akhromeev starts from the new Soviet program, just outlined 
                  by Gorbachev in his meeting with Reagan earlier in the day-proposing 
                  50% cuts of strategic weapons across the board, a zero option 
                  on intermediate-range missiles in Europe, and a 10-year period 
                  of non-withdrawal from the ABM treaty. At the same time, the 
                  U.S. delegation led by Paul Nitze conducts the discussion practically 
                  disregarding the new Soviet proposals and negotiating on the 
                  basis of U.S. proposals of 18 January 1986, which by now are 
                  overtaken by the latest developments in the Reagan-Gorbachev 
                  talks. Responding to U.S. proposals on allowing development 
                  of SDI while proceeding with deep cuts in strategic weapons, 
                  member of the Soviet delegation Georgy Arbatov comments &quot;what 
                  you are offering requires an exceptional level of trust. We 
                  cannot accept your position,&quot; directly implying that the 
                  necessary level of trust was not there. This document, prepared 
                  as a result of the all-night discussion, outlined the disagreements 
                  but failed to integrate the understandings achieved by the two 
                  leaders on October 11 or approached again on October 12.</font></p>

                  with a standard ideological criticism of Reagan as a class enemy 
                  who showed &quot;extreme primitivism, a caveman outlook and 
                  intellectual impotence.&quot; He goes on, however, to describe 
                  the summit as a breakthrough, and the attainment of a new &quot;higher 
                  level from which now we have to begin a struggle for liquidation 
                  and complete ban on nuclear armaments.&quot; The Politburo agrees

                <p>At this Politburo session Gorbachev 
                  and Shevardnadze discuss whether and when to reveal the new 
                  Soviet position on SDI testing, which would allow &quot;testing 
                  in the air, on the test sites on the ground, but not in space.&quot; 
                  This is a significant step in the direction of the U.S. position 
                  and is seen as a serious concession on the Soviet part by Foreign 
                  Minister Gromyko. Gorbachev is very concerned that the U.S. 
                  administration is &quot;perverting and revising Reykjavik, retreating 
                  from it.&quot; He places a great deal of hope in Shevardnadze-Shultz

                  back from Reagan's expressed intent at Reykjavik to eliminate 
                  all offensive nuclear weapons. In fact, the NSDD's version of 
                  Reykjavik completely leaves out the Reagan and Shultz statements

                Secretaries of the Central Committee, 1 December 1986, 4 pp.</font></p>
              <blockquote>
                <p>In a Politburo discussion of 
                  the Reagan decision to abandon the SALT II treaty, Gorbachev 
                  angrily states that the Americans are not doing anything in 
                  the spirit of Reykjavik and that the recent position of the 
                  Reagan administration was related to the domestic political 
                  crisis over Iran-Contra. Yegor Ligachev agrees with Gorbachev 
                  that after Reykjavik the Soviet positions only became stronger. 
                  Gorbachev speaks about his awareness of growing opposition to 
                  his disarmament proposals among the generals, who are &quot;hissing 
                  among themselves.&quot;</font></p>

                29</a></strong>: Meeting with the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Alton 
                G. Keel [Executive Secretary of the National Security Council], 
                18 December 1986 [for meeting on 19 December to discuss NSDD 250 
                and other topics], 7 pp. with staff attachments and talking points</font></p>
              <p>This set of documents demonstrates 
                  how the proposals on the table at Reykjavik had fallen off the 
                  table in Washington after the Iran-Contra scandal and Poindexter's 
                  departure, and as the result of the U.S. military's opposition. 
                  NSC senior staffer Alton Keel sets up an agenda for President 
                  Reagan's meeting with the Joint Chiefs of Staff that includes 
                  the elimination of ballistic missiles together with routine 
                  briefings about military exercises and anti-drug efforts in 
                  Bolivia, and alerts the President to the military's insistence 
                  on large spending increases. But he does not forward the striking 
                  talking points prepared by the NSC staff (under Poindexter) 
                  that would have expressed to the top U.S. military what Reagan 
                  had said at Reykjavik to Gorbachev.</font></p></p>
