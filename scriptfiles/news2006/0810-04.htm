David Potorti, who lost his brother James at the World Trade Center on 9/11, is a member of September Eleventh Families for Peaceful Tomorrows. He said today: "Nearly five years after 9/11, we are learning again that there are no walls high enough, no bombs big enough, no surveillance foolproof enough to protect us completely from terrorism in a globalized world. We're fortunate that no lives were lost in London this time. But in the long term, security is going to come only when individuals around the world unite in recognizing their common interests, supporting voices of moderation, and acknowledging and engaging the root causes of extremism in their own communities."<br />
<br />
This September, Peaceful Tomorrows is bringing to New York 30 people from around the world who have been personally affected by terrorism, violence and war and have gone on to successfully build bridges between groups previously in conflict and form organizations to promote justice, reconciliation and genuine peace. They represent Afghanistan, Iraq, Israel/Palestine, Algeria, Indonesia, Japan, Spain, Italy, South Africa, Ireland, Britain, Russia, Sudan, Rwanda, Colombia, Chile and the U.S. They will ultimately create an ongoing international network to share ideas and initiatives. Biographies can be viewed at the <a href="http://www.peacefultomorrows.org">Peaceful Tomorrows website</a>.<br />

Senior fellow at the Independent Institute, Eland wrote in a recent piece titled "9/11 Commission Chairmen Admit Whitewashing the Cause of the Attacks" that: "As both the Bush administration and its client government in Israel, with their invasions of Arab states in Iraq and Lebanon respectively, make the United States evermore hated in the Islamic world, a new book by the chairmen of the 9/11 commission admits that the commission whitewashed the root cause of the 9/11 attacks -- that same interventionist U.S. foreign policy."<br />
