<p>WASHINGTON - May 26 - Ned Lamont has won  MoveOn's endorsement for the Democratic nomination for U.S.  Senate in the organization's online Connecticut primary by a  margin of 85 pct. to 14 pct.</p>
<p>   The online primary was conducted during a 24-hour period  beginning May 25th at 8 am.  Lamont's win, which was triggered  when he passed two-thirds of the votes cast by MoveOn's  Connecticut members, will mean funding and volunteer support from  the national organization's members in his quest for the  Democratic Party's nomination in August.</p>
<p>   &quot;Lamont's substantial vote margin indicates the  dissatisfaction of many MoveOn members over Senator Lieberman's  continued support for the war in Iraq; his support for Big Oil's  energy bill; and overall fatigue with the senator,&quot; said Eli  Pariser, Executive Director of MoveOn.org Political Action.  &quot;Lamont's message resonated with members who want a senator who  will stand up to President Bush on key issues and represent the  views of most people in Connecticut,&quot; Pariser added.</p>

<p>   Last Thursday, both campaigns agreed to submit a message from  the candidate or a surrogate, as Senator Lieberman did during  MoveOn's 2004 online presidential primary. On Monday evening,  however, Lieberman's campaign informed MoveOn that the senator  had changed his mind and would not communicate with MoveOn's  Connecticut membership. The organization then sent out an e-mail  on the senator's behalf that summarized his campaign statements  and those of his most distinguished supporters.</p>
<p>   The following comments were typical of the sentiments  expressed by many of the MoveOn members who voted in the online  primary:</p>
<p>   &quot;I do not see that Senator Lieberman actually cares about  Connecticut voters. He has treated them with contempt and  complacence. I don't have a problem with Democrats who don't vote  the party line, but I do have a problem with senators who treat  their offices as an entitlement, and this is what Sen. Lieberman  seems to be doing.&quot; -- Dara from New Haven, CT</p>
<p>   &quot;Lamont is exactly the sort of candidate MoveOn should  support: a true progressive running against the forces of Beltway  conventional wisdom and accommodation of the Radical Right.&quot; --  Greg from Watertown, CT</p>
<p>   &quot;I'm impressed with the &quot;fresh approach&quot; that Ned Lamont seems  to bring to the table.  I think that he's correct when he says  that the Democratic party needs to stand out from the Republicans  (and the &quot;W&quot; administration).  At first I was leaning towards Joe  Lieberman because I can see that he is an established senator who  has many contacts and perhaps has the power of persuasion within  Washington, but I'm willing to take a chance on a &quot;new guy&quot; who  better fits the voice I'd like represented.&quot; -- Meegan from  Waterbury, CT</p>

<p>   &quot;Ned Lamont articulates my values about Iraq, health care, the  environment.&quot; -- Marion from Branford, CT</p>
<p>   Vote validation was conducted by Voter Roll Call-a SurveyUSA  Company.</p>

<p>   The Statement of Intent and rules of MoveOn's online primary  follow.</p>
<p>   <b>Statement of Intent and Rules</b></p>

<p>   This year in Connecticut the Democratic primary for United  States Senate will likely determine who holds the Senate seat.</p>
<p>   In most primary processes, pundits, pollsters and wealthy  donors determine the outcome long before the actual vote. By the  time the rest of us cast our ballots, the nomination is typically  a done deal. The MoveOn.org Political Action Primary allowed  thousands of voters to choose which candidate to endorse -- if  any.</p>
<p>   Consistent with MoveOn.org Political Action's policy for  endorsements, the candidate who garners support from two-thirds  of votes cast in the online primary will win the MoveOn member  endorsement. If no candidate garners two-thirds support we will  not make an endorsement.</p>
<p>   Here are the rules.</p>
<p>   1) Voting will occur for 24 hours starting on May 25, 2006 at  8:00 AM Eastern and ending May 26, 2006 at 8:00 AM Eastern.</p>
<p>   2) Only eligible persons may vote in the MoveOn online  primary. To be eligible for this primary you must be currently  subscribed to MoveOn's email list at a Connecticut postal address  and have joined MoveOn before May 18, 2006 at 9 a.m. People not  already on the MoveOn mailing list in Connecticut cannot vote in  this primary.</p>

<p>   3) The day before the primary, May 24, 2006, each of the two  presumed candidates in the Democratic primary will have a chance  to send an e-mail from themselves or a designee to the MoveOn  membership in Connecticut. Candidates are asked to submit a final  e-mail by May 23, 2006 at 5:00 PM Eastern to Eli Pariser. The e- mail may be text or HTML. It may contain hyperlinks and graphics.  No code that may trigger SPAM filters will be allowed. If the  candidate declines to send an e-mail, MoveOn may ask a proxy to  write an e-mail on behalf of the candidate or send a note  indicating that the candidate declined to participate.</p>
<p>   4) Ballots will be distributed via e-mail on May 25.  Members  will vote through a secure web form on a MoveOn.org Political  Action web page. The results will be tabulated by MoveOn.org  Political Action staff.</p>
<p>   5) Only one vote per member will be counted. A member may  change their vote during the 24 hour voting period. The last vote  the member registers will count as his or her official vote.</p>
<p>   6) The campaigns may ask supporters who meet the criteria  above to vote in the primary.  Any evidence of fraud will be  investigated, and fraudulent activity by candidates is cause for  immediate disqualification.</p>
<p>   7) To win the primary the candidate must receive two-thirds of  votes cast. If no candidate receives two-thirds support, MoveOn  won't issue an endorsement.</p>
<p>   8) As an anti-fraud measure, MoveOn.org Political Action will  conduct an automated phone poll of participants in the primary.  The phone poll is not a binding survey. It will be used to  identify fraud. If fraud is suspected the primary may be declared  invalid.</p>

<p>   9) This primary process and the rules governing it are the  exclusive domain of MoveOn.org Political Action and all questions  or disputes are resolved by Eli Pariser, Executive Director of  MoveOn.org Political Action.</p>
