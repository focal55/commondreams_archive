<p>WASHINGTON - September 25 - <p>   WHAT:    CBPP Conference Call: Examining New Health Savings Accounts  Bill</p>
<p>   WHEN:    Tuesday, Sept. 26 at 1 p.m. (EDT). Register:  <a href="http://releases.usnewswire.com/redir.asp?ReleaseID=73113&Link=http://www.cbpp.org/confcall.htm">http://www.cbpp.org/confcall.htm</a></p>
<p>   WHO:     Center staff:</p>
<p>   -- Edwin Park, senior fellow</p>
<p>   -- Jason Furman, senior fellow</p>
<p>   -- Robert Greenstein, executive director</p>
<p>   The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities will hold a  conference call briefing Tuesday, September 26 at 1 p.m. (ET) to  discuss a mark-up scheduled for September 27 of legislation to  expand Health Savings Accounts (HSAs) in the House Ways and Means  Committee.</p>
<p>   Some observers believe House Congressional leaders may combine  this bill, which was introduced on September 21, with heavily  lobbied legislation to cancel scheduled reductions in the fees  that Medicare pays to physicians and to try to push it through  Congress before this weekend's adjournment.</p>
<p>   The HSA legislation (H.R. 6134, introduced by Reps. Eric  Cantor and Paul Ryan) includes substantial HSA changes. A new  Center analysis finds that the bill would primarily benefit high- income households and make HSAs substantially more lucrative to  such households as a tax shelter. The report also finds that the  bill would likely lead to increases in health care spending,  despite the fact that a principal rationale advanced for HSAs is  that they would reduce such spending.</p>
<p>   The bill's consideration comes several weeks after release of  a major GAO report that shows HSAs already enjoy much heavier use  by high-income households than by other Americans, are regressive  in their distribution of tax benefits, and are apparently being  used widely as tax shelters.</p>
<p>   The panelists will discuss the GAO report as well as the  pending legislation.</p>
<p>   After opening remarks, the panelists will take questions.</p>
