<p>BRUSSELS - August 23 - Greenpeace International 
criticized the announcement by the European Commission (EC) today as a 
minimal response to a serious contamination problem.

<p>The EC stated that it would only impose testing and certification 
requirements on imports of long grain rice from the United States which 
does not address contamination from genetically engineered (GE) rice 
that may already be in food in the EU. The EC also relies on testing and 
information provided by Bayer, makes no commitment to its own assessment 
of the extent of the contamination problem and also imposes no penalties 
and costs against Bayer.

<p>The EC made this move after Commercial rice in the United States was 
found contaminated with genetically engineered (GE) Liberty Link (LL) 
rice 601, produced by agro-chemical giant Bayer and never intended for 
commercial release. Imports were, as a result, immediately banned in 
Japan. <a href="http://www.easybourse.com/Website/dynamic/News.php?NewsID=44088&lang=fra&NewsRubrique=2">(1)</a><p>"While the Commission should be congratulated for a quick response to 
this genetic contamination, this response is inadequate as rice is the 
world's most important staple food and is contained in many food 
products currently on EU shelves, "said Jeremy Tager, Greenpeace 
International GE campaigner. "It is time to move beyond case-by-case 
procedures as the GE industry has shown time and time again that it is 
unwilling or unable to prevent GE contamination."

<p>Greenpeace International calls on the EC to stop reacting to 
contamination 'accidents' and start preventing them instead. The EC 
should identify countries and products that are at high risk of 
contaminating our food supply with illegal or dangerous GE organisms and 
implement screening, preventative testing and, where there is no 
demonstrated capacity to prevent contamination, total bans.

<p>Greenpeace International calls on other major importing regions such as 
the Americas, Africa and the Middle East to take similar steps 
immediately until the US can guarantee that their rice supply - and 
other foods - are no longer contaminated.

<p>"A message needs to be sent to the US and to agro-chemical giant Bayer 
that genetic contamination and 'accidents' with our food are not 
acceptable, and ultimately they must be held liable for cleaning it up."

<p>Greenpeace campaigns for GE-free crop and food production grounded on 
the principles of sustainability, protection of biodiversity and 
providing all people to have access to safe and nutritious food. Genetic 
engineering is an unnecessary and unwanted technology that contaminates 
the environment, threatens biodiversity and poses unacceptable risks to 
health.
