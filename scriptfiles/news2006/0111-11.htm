<p>WASHINGTON - January 11 - Rep. Tom DeLay, R-Texas,  is threatening to "sue any station" that runs a new television ad  that links him to one of the worst congressional corruption  scandals ever. The two public interest groups that joined forces  this week to run the ads are vigorously fighting back.</p>
<p>   The groups, the Campaign for America's Future and the Public  Campaign Action Fund, unveiled $115,000 in new television, radio  and billboard ads targeting Rep. DeLay and Rep. Bob Ney, R-Ohio,  for their ties to corruption on a conference call with reporters  on Tuesday, kicking off a yearlong campaign to clean up Congress.</p>
<p>   KHOU-CBS, one of the stations originally scheduled to run the  spot, said that Rep. DeLay "threatened to sue any station" that  chooses to broadcast the ad, on in its morning news program.</p>

<p>   Campaign for America's Future co-director Roger Hickey said  Rep. DeLay, known as "the Hammer" in Congress, is trying to  intimidate Houston television stations in a pointless effort to  prevent public discussion.</p>
<p>   "The people of Houston know he has something to hide. We hope  their TV stations don't betray their First Amendment rights and  obligations by capitulating," said Hickey, noting that the two  groups have supplied documentation for the ad to each of the  stations.</p>
<p>   Public Campaign Action Fund national campaigns director David  Donnelly noted that Rep. DeLay is suppressing information from  his constituents.</p>
<p>   "Rep. DeLay doesn't want the people of Houston to know that  Russian interests allegedly gave $1 million to influence his  vote. In fact, he doesn't want anyone back home to know anything  he's up to with corrupt lobbyists in Washington," said Donnelly.  "When powerful lawmakers corrupt the political process and get  caught, they often try to bully the media to try to prevent them  from doing their job. We can't let him win."</p>
<p>   The television ads that link him to the Abramoff scandal began  airing on cable stations in Houston today despite threats from  Rep. DeLay and his Washington lawyers.</p>
