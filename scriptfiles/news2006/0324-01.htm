<p>   WHO:</p>
<p>   -- Robert Bixby, Executive Director, The Concord Coalition</p>
<p>   -- Robert Greenstein, Executive Director, Center on Budget and  Policy Priorities</p>
<p>   -- Maya MacGuineas, President, Committee for a Responsible  Federal Budget</p>
<p>   -- Joseph Minarik, Senior Vice President, Director of Research  Committee for Economic Development</p>
<p>   Four budget watchdog groups with diverse outlooks will hold a  joint conference call briefing Tuesday, March 28 at 11 a.m. (ET)  in opposition to a budget gimmick being considered by lawmakers  charged with working out the differences between House- and  Senate-passed versions of the tax reconciliation bill.</p>
<p>   The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, the Committee for  Economic Development, the Committee for a Responsible Federal  Budget, and the Concord Coalition will issue a joint statement  urging lawmakers to reject the use of the gimmick - which would  have one tax cut appear to pay for another tax cut -- to  circumvent a Senate rule intended to prevent reconciliation  legislation from increasing long-term deficits. (The rule applies  to legislation that would increase entitlement spending as well  as to legislation that would cut taxes.) The proposal under  consideration would induce taxpayers to move savings from  traditional IRAs to Roth IRAs, which would generate revenues in  the short run, but reduce revenues and increase deficits after  2015.</p>
<p>   Representatives of the four groups will make brief remarks to  explain the proposed gimmick lawmakers are considering and why  the use of such a gimmick is bad for fiscal discipline.</p>
<p>   After opening remarks, the panelists will take questions.</p>
