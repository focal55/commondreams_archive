<p>BOSTON - August 21 - With Members of Congress now in their home districts for summer recess, the Massachusetts Chapter of Military Families Speak Out (MFSO), joined by Massachusetts members of Iraq Veterans Against the War and Veterans for Peace will make a House Call at the home of Congressman Stephen Lynch to highlight the human toll of the Iraq war.  The House Call vigil will begin at 6:30 p.m. on Aug. 24.</p>
<p>   &quot;Rep. Lynch has not been responsive to me or other constituents who are calling for an end to this war,&quot; stated Military Families Speak Out member Maureen Hearn of Needham, Massachusetts. &quot;As the mother of a daughter currently serving in Iraq, I want him to know that each day he allows this war to continue is unconscionable. Many parents of daughters to are my daughter's age worry about their grades in college, or whether their job is suited to them, or how to help them afford gas these days. I worry every minute of every day about whether my daughter will make it through yet another day, as she participates in a war that should never have been. That is why I am joining other military families and Veterans in making this House Call.&quot;</p>
<p>   WHAT: Vigil at the Home of Congressional Rep. Stephen Lynch, with visuals</p>
<p>   WHEN: Thursday, Aug. 24, from 6:30 to 8 p.m. EDT</p>
<p>   WHERE: G Street between E. 4th and E. 5th, South Boston, MA 02127</p>
<p>   WHO: Iraq War Veterans, Veterans of previous conflicts, Military Families with loved ones currently serving in Iraq and who have returned from Iraq, and Gold Star families whose loved ones have died as a result of the war in Iraq.</p>
<p>   The House Call/Vigil at Congressman Lynch's house is part of Operation House Call, Military Families Speak Out's summer-long campaign to highlight the human toll of the War in Iraq. The campaign started on June 22nd in Washington, D.C., with a six-week long vigil in front of Congressional and Senate Office Buildings that each day included combat boots representing U.S. troop deaths, and shoes representing the deaths of Iraqi children, women and men since the June 15, 2006 Congressional vote to &quot;stay the course&quot; in Iraq. On June 22, the display included 11 pairs of combat boots and shoes representing the deaths of 141 Iraqis; when Congress left for recess on August 3rd, the vigil included 82 pairs of combat boots, and shoes representing the deaths of 1,800 Iraqi children, women and men. The second phase of Operation House Call is following Congress to their home states and districts, as MFSO's 26 local chapters and over 3,000 military families confront their elected officials to ask them &quot;Whose names are you willing to add to the growing list of casualties?&quot;</p>
