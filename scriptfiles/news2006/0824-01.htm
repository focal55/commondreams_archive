<p>WASHINGTON - August 24 - A new report released  today by the International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW)  documents a pattern of public safety and animal welfare  violations at U.S. facilities that house and exhibit big cats --  such as tigers, lions, panthers and jaguars. &quot;Fatal Attractions,&quot;  the new IFAW report, culminates an 18-month investigation of 42  USDA-licensed facilities in 11 states. Prompted by more than 100  big cat incidents and over a dozen fatalities in the past decade,  the report provides recommendations for changes to federal and  state policy. </p>
<p>   More than 5,000 big cats are kept in facilities licensed by  the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and it is estimated  that thousands more are kept as pets. </p>
<p>   &quot;We've seen too many tragedies that could have been  prevented,&quot; said Gregory Wetstone, IFAW's U.S. director. &quot;Against  a background of dozens of dangerous big cat incidents, the new  report demonstrates that the current USDA license system does not  guarantee public safety or humane conditions. Americans with big  cat exhibitors in their communities would be very surprised to  learn that the licensing agency has such limited legal authority  to protect the public safety. Congress should act now to give the  USDA the authority it needs to keep the public safe from big cat  attacks, and we urge the USDA to improve its standards for big  cats in captivity.&quot;</p>
<p>   The release of this critical report comes on the heels of new  legislation introduced by U.S. Rep. Jim Ryun (R-Kan.) to protect  the public from big cat attacks. IFAW worked closely with Rep.  Ryun to draft &quot;Haley's Act&quot; (HR 5909), named for 17-year-old  Haley Hilderbrand who was fatally attacked a year ago by a tiger  at a USDA licensed facility in Kansas. Haley went to the facility  to have her senior photo taken with tiger cubs, but when the cubs  became too frisky, a 550-pound tiger was substituted in the photo  shoot. The tiger attacked and killed Haley.</p>
<p>   In the 42 big cat facilities that IFAW visited: </p>
<p>   -- The majority of big cat facilities were structurally  unsound and some had no barriers at all.</p>
<p>   -- Direct contact between big cats and young children was  common.</p>
<p>   -- Many facilities had no attendants to handle the big cats  and some allowed children to work as attendants.</p>
<p>   -- Some animals were fed rotten meat and housed in cages with  dead animals, filthy water buckets and sewage.</p>
<p>   There are nearly 700 USDA big cat licensees in the United  States with the highest number of facilities in Florida, Texas  and California. In the past decade, there were 13 big cat  incidents in Florida, 12 in Texas, six in California and five  each in Illinois, Nevada, Minnesota and Kansas. Since 1990, big  cats killed 13 people in the U.S. alone.</p>
