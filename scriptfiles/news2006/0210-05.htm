<p>WASHINGTON - February 10 - For those  looking for the perfect diamond, human rights groups got what you  need.  Amnesty International and Global Witness today made public  a simple, new guide, 'Are you looking for the perfect diamond?',  to help shoppers ensure the diamonds they buy are conflict-free - - that they have not been traded to fund armed conflict and civil  war.</p>
<p>   On Valentine's Day, activists with Amnesty International  groups in more than 40 cities nationwide will distribute the  guide to their communities via informational sessions and tabling  at local shopping venues.  Available to the general public, the  guide can also be read and downloaded online at  <a href="http://releases.usnewswire.com/redir.asp?ReleaseID=60811&Link=http://www.amnestyusa.org/buyconflictfree">http://www.amnestyusa.org/buyconflictfree</a> and  <a href="http://releases.usnewswire.com/redir.asp?ReleaseID=60811&Link=http://www.globalwitness.org">http://www.globalwitness.org</a>.</p>
<p>   This guide is a valuable tool for shoppers who might be  looking for a special gift that will last forever. It recommends  that as well as the usual 4 C's -- color, cut, clarity and carat  -- shoppers should also ask about conflict before making their  purchase.</p>
<p>   &quot;We created this guide because people contact us every day  wondering how they can ensure the diamonds they buy are not  supporting civil war and human rights abuses,&quot; said Amy O'Meara  of Amnesty International USA's Business &amp; Human Rights Program.</p>
<p>   &quot;Diamonds are supposed to be symbols of love and devotion and  people want to be 100 percent certain that the stone they are  buying is clean. Despite some progress within the industry, many  jewelers still can't make this guarantee.&quot;</p>
<p>   Conflict diamonds are those sold in order to fund armed  conflict and civil war. Warlords and rebel groups in countries  including Angola, the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Liberia  and Sierra Leone have used billions of dollars of profits from  the sale of diamonds from the mines they control to buy arms and  fund devastating wars. Diamonds mined in rebel-held areas in Cote  d'Ivoire, a West African country in the midst of a volatile  conflict, are currently reaching the international diamond  market. This underground commerce was tragically depicted in the  recent film Lord of War starring Nicolas Cage.</p>
<p>   The guide explains that consumers in the United States can  make a difference by insisting that the diamond industry keep the  promises it has made to end the trade in conflict diamonds (1).  It recommends that prior to their diamond purchase shoppers ask  retailers the following questions:</p>
<p>   -- Do you know where the diamonds you sell originate?</p>
<p>   -- May I see a copy of your company's policy on conflict  diamonds?</p>
<p>   -- Would you show me a written guarantee from your diamond  suppliers that proves your diamonds are conflict free?</p>
<p>   Global Witness campaigner Susie Sanders added:</p>
<p>   &quot;We are making it easy for shoppers to find out if the jeweler  they choose is committed to conflict free. Diamonds may be  expensive, but they shouldn't cost lives.&quot;</p>
<p>   'Are you looking for the perfect diamond?' is now available  online at <a href="http://releases.usnewswire.com/redir.asp?ReleaseID=60811&Link=http://www.amnestyusa.org/buyconflictfree">http://www.amnestyusa.org/buyconflictfree</a> and  <a href="http://releases.usnewswire.com/redir.asp?ReleaseID=60811&Link=http://www.globalwitness.org">http://www.globalwitness.org</a></p>
<p>   Note to editors</p>
<p>   (1) In 2003, in response to a major international campaign and  significant media attention to the consequences of the trade in  conflict diamonds, an international certification scheme called  the Kimberley Process was launched. A Kimberley Process  certificate, guaranteeing diamonds as conflict free, should  accompany all shipments of rough diamonds to and from  participating countries. All sectors of the diamond industry also  agreed to a voluntary system of warranties to ensure diamonds  continue to be tracked right up to the point of sale. This is  what consumers are entitled to ask about.</p>
