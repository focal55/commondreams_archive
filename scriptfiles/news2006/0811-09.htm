<p>WASHINGTON - August 11 - Last night, Africa Action 
joined with local religious leaders and activists in Crawford, TX, to 
pressure President Bush to take new action to stop the continuing 
genocide in Darfur. This interfaith vigil, held at the Crawford Peace 
House, gathered dozens of people in prayer and discussion about the need 
for increased U.S. leadership to mobilize international action on this 
crisis.

<p>Speakers at the vigil included Rev. Robert Flowers, campus minister for 
the Wesley Foundation at Baylor University, and Rev. Edward Fana 
Vincent, Social Action Coordinator at the Shrine of the Black Madonna in 
Houston, TX.

<p>Ann-Louise Colgan, acting Co-Executive Director of Africa Action, said 
today, "This vigil is only one example of many gatherings around the 
country calling for greater U.S. commitment to Darfur. President Bush 
must now challenge the Sudanese government's opposition to a UN 
peacekeeping force for Darfur, and pave the way for such a force to be 
authorized and deployed. This is the immediate next step required, and 
the U.S. must take every step necessary to achieve this goal."

<p>This week, an op-ed by Ann-Louise Colgan entitled "Empty Promises for 
Darfur" was published at TomPaine.com, detailing the need for a UN 
peacekeeping operation and appropriate steps for the U.S. to overcome 
the current deadlock on this crisis. The full text is available here: 
http://africaaction.org/newsroom/index.php?op=read&documentid=2031&type=15&issues=1024

<p>Ann-Louise Colgan went on to say, "Almost two years ago, the U.S. took 
an important step and accurately applied the genocide label to the 
killing in Darfur. In the years since, Africa Action has made the simple 
demand that the U.S. follow through on its own statements and take 
seriously the responsibility to act that such a declaration requires."

<p>Africa Action, following the success of the interfaith vigil in 
Crawford, will press on with its Darfur escalation strategy, available 
here: 
<a href="http://www.africaaction.org/campaign_new/docs/PumpingUpthePowertoProtect2.pdf">http://www.africaaction.org/campaign_new/docs/PumpingUpthePowertoProtect2.pdf</a>. 
<p>The organization and its activists continue to mobilize towards a major 
rally in front of the White House on September 9th, recalling the date 
two years ago when the U.S. first declared the crisis in Darfur to be 
genocide and urging new action to stop the violence and protect the 
people of Darfur.
