<p>WASHINGTON - January 3 - One of Washington's biggest ethics scandals in recent history deepened today with lobbyist Jack Abramoff's decision to cooperate in the ongoing federal investigation into Congressional corruption.&#160; Dozens of members of Congress have been implicated in the investigation and could now find themselves in legal jeopardy.
<p>"The extent of Jack Abramoff's influence on our government is breathtaking," said Common Cause President Chellie Pingree.&#160; "The fact that he was an unscrupulous criminal who managed to work his way deep into many of Capitol Hill's most powerful offices is an indictment on our system as a whole."</p>
<p>Abramoff's testimony will shine a new light into the darker corners of our federal lobbying system.&#160; With little or no oversight for almost a decade, lobbying Congress has become a practice rife with abuses that routinely violate rules and regulations.&#160; As a result, we have an anything-goes culture today in Washington that has left the public with little confidence about whose interest elected officials are working for.</p>
<p>If Congress is serious about tackling the problems of corruption, it will acknowledge its significant failure to enforce its own rules for members of Congress and lobbyists, and make serious reforms.</p>
