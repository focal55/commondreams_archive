<p>WASHINGTON - May 1 - The U.S. Justice Department&#8217;s plans to fund single-faith prison ministry programs is constitutionally suspect and should be dropped, says Americans United for Separation of Church and State.</P>
<P>The Justice Department has announced it is seeking prison rehabilitation programs for six federal prisons intended to &#8220;facilitate personal transformation of the participating inmates through their own spirituality and faith.&#8221; The Federal Bureau of Prisons&#8217; solicitation for the programs also asks potential bidders how their approach would &#8220;foster growth&#8221; in the &#8220;spiritual development&#8221; of inmates. </P>
<P>In a letter sent to Attorney General Alberto Gonzales and Federal Bureau of Prisons Director Harley Lappin, Americans United argued that the attempt to set up and fund single-faith prison ministry programs violates the First Amendment principle of church-state separation. </P>
<P>&#8220;This proposal on its face is plainly unconstitutional,&#8221; said the Rev. Barry W. Lynn, executive director of Americans United. &#8220;The federal government cannot fund a program that plays favorites among religions and uses tax dollars to pay for spiritual transformation.</P>
<P>&#8220;The administration&#8217;s attempt to fund such a blatantly unconstitutional scheme shows just how far adrift it is with its &#8216;faith-based&#8217; agenda,&#8221; Lynn continued. &#8220;The plan should be open to all faiths and secular rehabilitation programs or it should be scrapped.&#8221; </P>
<P><EM>The Washington Post</em> reported April 29 that a spokeswoman for the Federal Bureau of Prisons said $3 million has been appropriated for the religious prison programs.</P>
<P>In a letter to Gonzales and Lappin, Americans United Senior Litigation Counsel Alex Luchenitser argued that the federal government&#8217;s planned prison program, which is intended to help inmates re-enter society, violates the First Amendment because it promotes religious programs over secular ones, creates a preference for instruction in single-faith over multi-faith programming, appears to favor a specific religious prison ministry program and contains no safeguards to ensure that government funds are not used to support religious activity. </P>
<P>Luchenitser notes in his letter that the federal government&#8217;s solicitation for the prison programs appears tailored to InnerChange, a fundamentalist Christian prison ministry program run by Charles Colson&#8217;s Prison Fellowship Ministries. </P>
<P>&#8220;As the solicitation appears intended to result in contract awards to Prison Fellowship/InnerChange, it violates&#8221; the First Amendment&#8217;s bar against government favoring one religion over another, asserts the AU letter. </P>
<P>Mark Early, the president of Prison Fellowship Ministries, told <EM>The Post</EM> that his group does offer a single-faith residential prison ministry program and that it is &#8220;very interested&#8221; in the federal government&#8217;s program.</P>
<P id=aboutau>Americans United is a religious liberty watchdog group based in Washington, D.C. Founded in 1947, the organization educates Americans about the importance of church-state separation in safeguarding religious freedom.</P>
