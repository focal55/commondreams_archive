<p>WASHINGTON  - January 17 - Media Matters for  America today criticized the reported hiring by CNN Headline News  of controversial, nationally syndicated conservative radio host  Glenn Beck. Beck has signed onto the network "for an hourlong  talkshow," according to a January 17 report in Variety.</p>
<p>   "CNN Headline News' decision to sign Glenn Beck is a slap in  the face to the families of 9-11 victims, whom Beck has  proclaimed he 'hate(s);' it is a slap in the face to victims of  Hurricane Katrina, whom Beck has called 'scumbags,' " said David  Brock, President and CEO of Media Matters.</p>
<p>   Media Matters has documented some of Beck's more notable  comments:</p>
<p>   -- On families of the victims of the September 11, 2001,  terrorist attacks: "(T)his is horrible to say, and I wonder if  I'm alone in this -- you know, it took me about a year to start  hating the 9-11 victims' families? Took me about a year."</p>
<p>   -- On Hurricane Katrina survivors who remained in New Orleans:  "And that's all we're hearing about, are the people in New  Orleans. Those are the only ones that we're seeing on television  are the scumbags -- and again, it's not all the people in New  Orleans. Most of the people in New Orleans got out! It's just a  small percentage of those who were left in New Orleans, or who  decided to stay in New Orleans, and they're getting all the  attention."</p>
<p>   -- Discussing disclosures from a caller who claimed to have  tortured prisoners in U.S. custody: "I've got to tell you, I  appreciate your service. ... Good for you. Good for -- I mean,  good for you. Is it because you did it for the country? ... I  have to tell you, when all is said and done, I'm glad people like  you are on our side."</p>
<p>   -- On filmmaker Michael Moore: "Hang on, let me just tell you  what I'm thinking. I'm thinking about killing Michael Moore, and  I'm wondering if I could kill him myself, or if I would need to  hire somebody to do it. No, I think I could. I think he could be  looking me in the eye, you know, and I could just be choking the  life out -- is this wrong?"</p>
<p>   -- On the father of Nick Berg, American civilian executed in  Iraq: "The want to be a better person today than I was yesterday  says he's a dad, he's grieving, but I don't buy that. I'm sorry,  I don't buy it. I think he is grieving, but I think he's a  scumbag as well. I don't like this guy at all."</p>
<p>   "For CNN to tap an unapologetic preacher of hate signals a  desperate and misguided ploy for ratings without regard for the  thousands of Americans Beck has offended with his malicious  commentary," added Brock.</p>
