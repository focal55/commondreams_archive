<p>WASHINGTON - November 6 - Former President Bill Clinton made a surprise appearance at Saturday’s 10th Annual Miami Recognition Dinner, a benefit for the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force , where he wowed the 650-plus-crowd. Clinton, who was in South Florida to campaign for Democratic candidates, arrived at the event around 8 p.m., where he proceeded to greet NAACP Chairman Julian Bond, one of the evening’s honorees, and then shake hands with numerous attendees.

<p>The 10th Annual Miami Recognition Dinner honored Bond, who received the evening's National Leadership Award, and local honorees TWN and philanthropist Bob Cole, recipient of the Miami Herald Humanitarian Award. In his keynote address, Bond lambasted the tactics of opponents of marriage equality for same-sex couples. The event raised more than $270,000, two-thirds of which will be donated by the Task Force to organizations serving the Miami-Dade LGBT community.
