<p>LEXINGTON, Kentucky - February 27 - The Kentucky Million Mom March Chapters of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun  Violence released the following statement today on proposed gun  legislation in Kentucky: </p>
<p>   Last week, the Kentucky State House took a step in the wrong  direction when they passed a horrible piece of legislation  (HB 236) that could make Kentucky a much more dangerous place.   If it passes the State Senate, this legislation would make it  legal for a gun owner in Kentucky to shoot and kill another  person whenever they feel threatened -- even in a public place.</p>
<p>   The Shoot First law, known alternatively as the &quot;make my day&quot;  law, made Florida a virtual laughingstock when it became law  there last October, generating news coverage around the world  suggesting that visitors might face risk.  </p>
<p>   &quot;This bill will enable the most aggressive and paranoid  individuals in Kentucky to use deadly force anywhere against a  presumed assailant,&quot; said Sarah Brady of the Brady Campaign to  Prevent Gun Violence.  &quot;Passing the Shoot First law was a foolish  mistake in Florida, and Kentucky is looking at repeating  Florida's mistake.&quot;</p>
<p>   &quot;We are urging the State Senate to reject this dangerous  solution to a nonexistent problem,&quot; said Nancy McKenney,  co-president of the Kentucky Million Mom March Chapters of the  Brady Campaign.  &quot;Don't let anyone tell you this is just a  self-defense bill.  This bill goes far beyond that.&quot;</p>
<p>   The Shoot First bill was introduced in the Kentucky House as  HB 236 and in the Senate as SB 52.  It very closely tracks  legislation pushed in Florida last year by the National Rifle  Association that police leaders and prosecutors around the nation  have derided as dangerous and unnecessary.  </p>
<p>   Proponents of this law argue that it is just a self-defense  bill, but HB 236/SB 52 goes far beyond just protecting one's  home.  The Shoot First bill allows Kentuckians to use deadly  force as a first resort to counter perceived threats, even in  public, as long as they are in a place they have &quot;a right to be&quot;  and they reasonably believe deadly force is necessary to prevent  bodily harm.</p>
<p>   Newspapers around the country have spoken out about the  dangers of this legislation.  The conservative Arizona Star  newspaper called it &quot;poorly thought out, unnecessary and  potentially dangerous.&quot;  </p>
<p>   The Miami Herald said &quot;people involved in violent  clashes -- ranging from criminal activities to domestic disputes  that escalate -- now have another justification for killing.&quot;  </p>
<p>   The Atlanta Journal Constitution wrote &quot;under this broad law,  a bar fight over a football game could legally end in gunfire and  death if one of the combatants claimed to fear bodily harm.  A  gang member could legally shoot and kill a member of a rival  gang, claiming he felt his life was threatened.&quot; </p>
<p>   Supporters of the legislation claim it is necessary to  guarantee that people can defend themselves.  But there are no  individuals in jail anywhere in the U.S. for acting in legitimate  self-defense.  The only individuals this legislation can  conceivably benefit, therefore, are individuals who would  otherwise be convicted of a crime.  &quot;This will make our jobs  10 times harder,&quot; said Randy Hillman of the Alabama District  Attorney's Association.  &quot;It will confuse jurors in criminal  trials and give criminals more of a defense.&quot;</p>
<p>   Police leaders have expressed concern that the law will send a  message of empowerment to the most aggressive individuals in  society -- that rather than serve to defend people who use deadly  force in a truly life-threatening situation, it will serve as an  excuse to edgy individuals.  The record so far bears this out: In  its first Florida application, the law is being cited as a  defense for a tow truck operator who killed the irate owner of a  car he had just towed.  &quot;Everyone is apparently safer in  Florida,&quot; wrote the Atlanta Journal Constitution editorial board,  &quot;now that there's one fewer illegal parker roaming the streets.&quot; </p>
<p>   America's police officers undergo months of intensive training  to learn the judicious use of deadly force in a public setting.   They learn, through that training, that the use of deadly force  in public is excruciatingly dangerous, and that innocent  bystanders can easily be injured or killed.  </p>
<p>   These bills immediately deputize anyone with a weapon to take  on a criminal in potentially crowded public settings.  It's  extraordinarily ill advised and irresponsible. </p>
