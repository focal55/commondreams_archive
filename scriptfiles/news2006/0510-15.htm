<p>WASHINGTON - May 10 - Just as soaring gas prices heat up the hybrid vehicle market, the International Academy of Digital Arts and Sciences announced that the Union of Concerned Scientist's (UCS) <a href="http://www.HybridCenter.org" target="_new">HybridCenter.org</a> website received the award for "Best Guides/Ratings/Reviews" in the 10th Annual Webby Awards competition (www.webbyawards.com). Dubbed "the online equivalent of an Oscar" by The New York Times, this year's competition was unparalleled in its decade-long history, with over 5,500 sites entered from all 50 states and 40 different nations.  

<p>"We created the HybridCenter because we thought Hybrids were the right subject at the right time," said Jason Mark, director of the UCS Clean Vehicles Program. "Because hybrid technology has the potential to save consumers money at the pump and reduce global warming pollution, this was a hot topic even before gas prices went through the roof. The HybridCenter combines consumer-friendly information with our technical and policy expertise to help people find out which hybrid is best for their pocketbook and the planet. We are delighted that the International Academy of Digital Arts and Sciences were kind enough to honor our efforts."

<p>Among the HybridCenter's unique features is a comprehensive list of federal, state, and local incentives relating to hybrid vehicles, allowing consumers and policymakers see the breadth of policy initiatives to promote hybrid vehicle technologies. The "Who's Got Hybrids?" feature -- hosted by Bill Nye "The Science Guy" -- contains hundreds of pictures and testimonials from hybrid drivers giving their real-world reviews from all around the nation. And HybridCenter keeps its pulse on the latest in clean vehicle market developments through HybridBlog, the first weblog undertaken by UCS.

<p>"The winners of the 10th Annual Webby Awards reflect the web's incredible diversity and the vital role it plays in all aspects of our daily lives," said Tiffany Shlain, Webby founder and ambassador. "We're proud to salute the people and organizations whose groundbreaking ideas are reshaping how we experience our world."
