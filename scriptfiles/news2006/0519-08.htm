<p>NEW YORK  - May 19 - The American Civil Liberties Union today welcomed the 
recommendations of the U.N. Committee Against Torture which called for an end to 
U.S. policies that condone torture and abuse. The recommendations come at the 
conclusion of a three-week session during which the U.N. body of 10 independent 
experts on torture scrutinized a periodic report by the U.S. government and 
found it sorely lacking.&nbsp; <BR>
<BR>
&#8220;The message from the torture committee 
leaves no doubt that the U.S. policies and practices at home and abroad violated 
bedrock principles against torture and abuse,&#8221; said Jamil Dakwar, an attorney 
with the ACLU Human Rights Program who was in Geneva monitoring the 
session.&nbsp; &#8220;"If America is to regain its status as a beacon of freedom 
around the world, the U.S. government must take immediate steps to end its 
policies of abuse and to hold officials and perpetrators accountable."<BR>
<BR>
The 
committee&#8217;s exceptionally long and comprehensive recommendations are not legally 
binding, but they place an important moral obligation on the U.S. government, 
which has committed to complying with the treaty before the nations of the 
world, the ACLU said.&nbsp; The recommendations include the following: 
<UL><LI><P>Ensure that no one is detained in any secret detention 
facility;</P><LI><P>Promptly, thoroughly, and impartially investigate any 
responsibility of senior military and civilian officials authorizing, 
acquiescing or consenting, in any way, to acts of torture committed by their 
subordinates.</P><LI><P>Cease to detain any person at Guant&#225;namo Bay and close 
this detention facility, permit access by the detainees to judicial process or 
release them as soon as possible, ensuring that they are not returned to any 
State where they could face a real risk of being tortured;</P><LI><P>Promptly, 
thoroughly and impartially investigate all allegations of acts of torture or 
cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment by law enforcement personnel 
and bring perpetrators to justice;</P><LI><P>Carefully review execution methods, 
in particular lethal injection in order to prevent severe pain and 
suffering;</P></LI></UL><P></P><UL><LI>Design and implement appropriate measures to prevent all 
sexual violence, in all its detention centers;<BR><LI>Not limit the right of 
victims to bring civil actions and amend the Prison Litigation Reform Act 
accordingly;<BR><LI>Address sentences of life imprisonment of children as 
these could constitute cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment; 
and,<BR><LI>Ensure that reports of brutality and ill-treatment of members of 
vulnerable groups by its law enforcement personnel are independently, promptly 
and thoroughly investigated and that perpetrators are prosecuted and 
appropriately punished.</LI></UL>
<P>The committee also asked the U.S. government, within one year, to provide 
detailed information on specific issues and recommendations both on the domestic 
and extraterritorial level.<BR><BR>The ACLU monitored the committee proceedings and 
provided information about U.S. sponsored policies and practices of torture and 
abuse at home and abroad. On May 8, the ACLU delivered a petition to John 
Bellinger, a Department of State legal advisor who headed the U.S. delegation in 
Geneva, with more than 51,000 signatures calling for the enforcement of the 
universal prohibition against torture.<BR><BR>The U.N. Committee Against Torture is 
the world's leading human rights body tasked with holding countries accountable 
for torture and abuse. The committee, which meets twice a year to examine 
countries' compliance with the treaty, held a session earlier this month to 
review U.S. compliance with the torture treaty, ratified by the U.S. in 1994. 
<BR>At the beginning of the Geneva session, the ACLU presented the committee 
with its detailed report, Enduring Abuse: Torture and Cruel Treatment by the 
United States at Home and Abroad, which documents U.S. failure to comply with 
the treaty against torture within the U.S. and abroad.<BR><BR>In a related matter, 
yesterday a U.S. District Court said that Khaled El-Masri, a victim of the CIA&#8217;s 
policy of kidnapping and rendition, could not pursue his lawsuit against the 
U.S. government.&nbsp; According to the court, the simple fact of holding 
proceedings would jeopardize state secrets, a position advanced by the 
CIA.&nbsp; The ACLU is representing El-Masri.<BR><BR>The ACLU was founded in 1920 
and is now the nation's largest civil liberties organization with more than 
500,000 members. It is one of the few domestic groups involved in a broad 
expanse of legal cases and advocacy efforts involving both domestic and 
extra-territorial abuse. </P><P>The ACLU's report to the Committee Against Torture 
is available online at:<BR><A class=noline_blue href="http://www.aclu.org/safefree/torture/25354pub20060427.html">www.aclu.org/safefree/torture/25354pub20060427.html</A>

Freedom of Information Act lawsuit are available online in a searchable database
