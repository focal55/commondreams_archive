<p>MANILA, Philippines - November 28 -   
      Rice producers from Thailand and Vietnam, together the world's biggest exporter, have announced their commitment to only growing GE free rice, in a new Memorandum of Understanding announced last week. The two countries account for more than half of all the rice traded in the world market today and will put mounting pressure on other rice producing nations to commit to a GE free rice supply. 
    </p>
    <div class="body">    
      "This announcement from the biggest rice exporters occurred after
massive backlash against the GE industry following the recent scandals
where illegal and unapproved GE rice varieties from the US and China
contaminated the global rice supply," said Jeremy Tager of Greenpeace
International. <br>
<br>
In the wake of the announcement, Greenpeace today revealed yet another
major contamination, this time in the Philippines, where rice is the
staple food:&nbsp; Bayer's LL601 - - has contaminated rice products
coming from the US, which are currently on sale in Manila(1). The brand
found to be contaminated by GE rice is "Uncle Sam Texas Long Grain
Rice" which is distributed in the Philippines by Purefeeds Inc and sold
in major supermarkets like Robinson's, Shopwise and SM.<br>
<br>
"The public must be immediately warned, and the government must recall
all US rice and rice products from supermarket shelves," said Danny
Ocampo of Greenpeace Southeast Asia. "The Philippine Government must
safeguard the staple food of Filipinos. The latest GE contamination
scandal shows that once GE organisms are released into the environment,
the consequences for consumers, farmers and traders are enormous,"
Ocampo added.<br>
<br>
The global food industry is now facing massive costs associated with GE
contamination, including testing costs, product recalls, brand damage,
import bans and cancelled imports and contracts.&nbsp; At least five
multi-million dollar class action lawsuits have been filed by about 300
US rice farmers against Bayer, as they struggle to protect their
livelihoods from GE contamination. In addition, the world's largest
rice processing company, Ebro Puleva, which controls 30% of the EU rice
market, has stopped all imports of rice from the US and is expected to
bring legal action against Bayer as well.<br>
<br>
The company responsible for the global contamination is Bayer, which
ended field trials of the LL601 variety in the US five years ago. So
far in 2006, this unapproved and illegal variety has been found in at
least 24 countries. Last week contamination was announced in several
countries in Africa. How small scale field trials in the US resulted in
global contamination of rice supplies is still not known. Many
countries including the EU, Russia and Japan have responded with import
restrictions, and recent export figures show serious declines in US
long grain rice sales.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
Earlier, Chinese rice exports to the EU were also found to be contaminated by illegal GE Bt63 rice. <br>
<br>
Greenpeace campaigns for GE-free crop and food production that is
grounded in the principles of sustainability, protection of
biodiversity and providing all people to have access to safe and
nutritious food. Genetic engineering is an unnecessary and unwanted
technology that contaminates the environment, threatens biodiversity
and poses unacceptable risks to health.&nbsp;

    <div class="Section"> <b>Notes to Editor</b>
<p class="notes-to-editor">(1) On Friday 24th November the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) granted marketing approval of Bayer's LL601 GE rice variety following its illegal contamination of the food supply and rice exports, first discovered 11months ago. The controversial decision was taken at the request of the developer, Bayer CropScience, solely to ensure that it is not responsible for the ongoing contamination of US rice supplies. Bayer dropped plans to commercialize the variety five years ago and has no intention to market the variety.  The decision by the USDA provides some legal protection for  Bayer for future contamination caused by its LL rice.<br />
(2) The presence of illegal rice was verified in nine samples of U.S. food aid and commercial imports after tests were conducted in an independent laboratory in the U.S. The unapproved GE rice has been detected in rice sent to Ghana and Sierra Leone and the results were publicly announced by Friends of the Earth Africa in a simultaneous press conference in both countries in the morning of the 24th of November. <a href="http://www.eraction.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=27">http://www.eraction.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=27</a></p>
