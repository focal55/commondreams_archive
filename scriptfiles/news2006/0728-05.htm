<p>WASHINGTON - July 28 - This morning, two hunger strikers interrupted the long 
overdue Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing on John Bolton's 
nomination as US Ambassador to the U.N. They wore t-shirts saying "No 
Bolton" and urged Senators to reject Bolton as the worst possible choice 
for the job and for world peace.

<p>Gael Murphy, 52 and Eve Tetaz, 73, both of Washington, D.C., were 
removed by Capitol Police for disrupting the hearing. Murphy, a 
co-founder of CODEPINK, is currently on her 24th day of a long-term fast 
for peace called Troops Home FAST (<a href="http://www.troopshomefast.org" target="_new">www.troopshomefast.org</a>). As Bolton 
finished his remarks and Senator Richard Lugar (R-IN) opened the floor 
to questions, she stood up and told the Senators, "As a resident of 
Washington, D.C. without a representative in the Senate, I want to 
register my "no" vote to this man's confirmation as ambassador. This man 
does not represent the interests of the US,  He does not speak for the 
American people. This is a man who says a cease-fire is unnecessary 
while civilians are being bombed and ambulances and hospitals are being 
hit. John Bolton is a man for war not peace"

<p>Tetaz also spoke to the Committee saying, "I object to this appointment 
in the name of my grandchildren. John Bolton does not speak for people 
who stand by the principles of human rights and international 
cooperation. How can he represent the United States in the U.N. if he 
violates the core principles of justice, mercy, and diplomacy?"

<p>Three others attended the hearing wearing t-shirts denouncing the 
appointment, including hunger-strikers Ret. Col. Ann Wright, 59, of 
Honolulu, Hawaii, Jesse Dyen, 36 of Oakland, CA and Linda Weiner, 45 of 
Vancouver, Washington.

<p>Over thirty foreign Ambassadors - of countries that agree with the U.S. 
on U.N. reform issues - have independently raised concerns about Bolton. 
<p>Bolton, who has defied orders, manipulated intelligence, and abused 
subordinates throughout his career, is a loose cannon.  He does not 
tolerate dissent, nor does he work with people who hold opposing 
viewpoints - the most basic element of diplomacy.  John Bolton simply 
can't get the results we need.

<p>With an increasingly volatile situation in the Middle East, and 
declining support around the world for the U.S. hard-lined positions, we 
need more than ever a U.N. Ambassador who can reach out to others rather 
than further isolating the U.S. from the international community.

<p>Wright said, "as a 16-year diplomat, Bolton is no diplomat, he is the 
worst possible choice for ambassador if America wants to regain any 
stature in the world and be known as anything other than a bully. John 
Bolton epitomized the bullying of the Bush Administration."
