<p>NEW YORK - June 28 - The 
American Civil Liberties Union today welcomed a call by the London-based group 
Privacy International to investigate the U.S. government's tracking of financial 
information from the SWIFT financial cooperative, and said that it was assisting 
PI in its effort to press European officials to take action. 
<P>"Privacy rights are being violated on both sides of the Atlantic -- and&nbsp; 
we welcome a European investigation to get to the bottom of this," said Barry 
Steinhardt, Director of the ACLU's Technology and Liberty Project. </P>
<P>Privacy International sent a letter to national privacy commissioners across 
Europe calling upon them to launch investigations of the SWIFT data 
sharing.&nbsp; "We are concerned that the practice substantially violates Data 
Protection law and we ask that you intervene with a view to making a demand that 
the disclosure programme be suspended pending legal review," PI wrote in its 
letter.&nbsp; "The scale of the operation, involving millions of records, places 
this disclosure in the realm of a fishing exercise rather than legally 
authorised investigation."&nbsp; </P>
<P>The letter follows last week's revelation that the U.S. government had been 
sifting through domestic and international financial data from SWIFT without 
Congressional authorization or judicial oversight.</P>
<P>"The ACLU has been providing Privacy International with information about 
American law and the status of any investigations here, while they have been 
keeping us abreast of European developments," said Steinhardt.&nbsp; "More and 
more we're seeing civil liberties being violated across national boundaries, and 
so civil liberties groups have to respond by working together to defend those 
liberties across national boundaries." </P>
<P>Steinhardt added, "things have reached a crisis point when some of our best 
hopes for preserving privacy in America lie with foreign commissioners."</P>
