<p>LOS ANGELES - September 13 - ‘Fascism’ has become the new catchphrase in the war on terror. In August, Bush coined the term “Islamo-fascism” to refer to the ideology of terrorists. Recently, Donald Rumsfeld compared critics of the Bush administration to those who tried to appease the Nazis before World War II, saying the country is facing “a new type of fascism.” Aaron Russo’s timely documentary, “America: Freedom to Fascism,” posits the idea that it is actually the U.S. government that is going down the road to fascism. 

<p>Originally shown to American audiences at test screenings in July, “America: Freedom to Fascism,” which takes on the IRS, the Federal Reserve and other organizations and entities that have abridged the freedoms of U.S. citizens, is set to open in theaters across the country. Cinema Libre Studio will release the film in cities including Los Angeles, Portland, and Denver beginning September 29 and widening thereafter. 

<p>There was a rush to the box office July 28 as “America: Freedom to Fascism” opened in test markets in New York, Chicago, Austin, Tampa and Kansas City. The estimated box office for the week was $87,400. Russo used the test markets to evaluate audience response before a wider release. The film was met with standing ovations and excellent exit polls. Now, Russo and Cinema Libre Studio will bring the film to theaters across the country. 

<p>The film has received phenomenal support from the grassroots and online community. During the test run weekend, one grassroots supporter went as far as chartering a bus from Allentown, PA to New York just to help people attend the premiere of the film and meet Russo. There have been requests from all over the country to bring the film to more cities since the initial test run. Over $450,000 has been raised to support the film through donations from grassroots supporters. There have been over 750,000 trailer views on the <a href="http://www.freedomtofascism.com">www.freedomtofascism.com</a>. 

<p>Russo’s timely film connects the dot between money creation, voter fraud, the national identity card (which becomes law in May 2008), the implementation of Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology to track citizens and the evolving police state in America.  Through interviews with experts including  Congressman Ron Paul (R - TX), former IRS criminal investigator Joe Banister, author of “Spychips,” Katherine Albrecht, author and founder of  www.fromthewilderness.com Michael Ruppert, and G. Edward Griffin (Author of “Creature from Jekyll Island”), Russo makes a startling examination of government that exposes the systematic erosion of civil liberties in America that is neither left nor right-wing.

<p>Russo is best known as the producer of feature films including “The Rose” with Bette Midler, “Trading Places” with Eddie Murphy and Dan Aykroyd; and “Teachers” starring Nick Nolte and Morgan Freeman. To date his films have been nominated for six Academy Awards as well as seven Golden Globes. His films have won three Golden Globes and the NAACP Image Award. He also won an Emmy-award for the best television special of the year starring Dustin Hoffman and Bette Midler in 1979.  He also won a Tony on Broadway for his production of “Clams on the Half-Shell Review.”
