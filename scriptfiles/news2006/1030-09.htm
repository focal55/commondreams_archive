<p>GENEVA - October 30 - More than two months after the ceasefire, the civilian population in Lebanon continues to bear the consequences of the recent hostilities. Mainly in the south of the country, but also in the southern suburbs of Beirut, the inadequate water supply is still affecting the daily lives of tens of thousands of people. Work to repair damaged water-distribution networks continues apace.<br>
<br>
Many parts of southern Lebanon are heavily contaminated by explosive remnants of war, which pose a significant threat to the population and prevent many displaced civilians from returning to their homes. Cluster munitions scattered in farmland and fruit groves are a serious obstacle to farming in a region where agriculture is the main source of income.<br>
<br>
<br />
<b><b>ICRC helps restore water supply in southern Lebanon</b></b>
<p><br>
The Wazzani water-pumping station and the Taibe water-treatment plant are key facilities supplying drinking water to villages in south-eastern Lebanon. Both were damaged during the recent hostilities. Water is pumped from the Wazzani springs and the Litani river to the Taibe plant, where it is treated. Clean drinking water is then distributed to more than 30 villages where nearly 100,000 Lebanese have been attempting to resettle since the cessation of hostilities.<br>
<br>
The ICRC has been working to refurbish both stations. At Wazzani, where it supplied a backup generator and carried out repairs on the hydraulic surge protection, a damaged 1,000 cubic-metre reservoir and other plumbing system components, the work has been completed and the facilities have been handed over to the South Lebanon Water Establishment. The operation under way at Taibe, which involves upgrading the sand filters, reservoir and distribution chamber, should be finished in early November.<br>
<br>
The ICRC has also begun to carry out work on important southern Lebanese water reservoirs in Aitaroun, Marun El Ras, Ramieh, Markaba and Wazzani with the aim of ensuring a permanently adequate and reliable water supply. Some reservoirs are being completely rebuilt, whereas others only need improvements.<br>
<br>
The ICRC has also supplied 32,000 litres of fuel since the beginning of October to help run water stations in the south of the country, in the areas of Yarin, Majdel Zoon, Mansouri, Rachaf, Qafra, Saddiqin, Marun El Ras, Marouahin and Bent Jbeil.<br>
<br>
<br /><b><b>Displaced families receive food and other essentials from the ICRC</b></b><br />
<p><br>
Displaced persons, their host families and other vulnerable people have received aid from the ICRC through the Lebanese Red Cross emergency medical services in Dahiyeh (Hay El-Selloum and Mreijeh districts) and through the Civil Campaign for Relief in Beirut (Khandak El-Ghamik and Cola districts). Aid has also been distributed in the Baalbeck, Mount Lebanon and Nabatieh areas and in southern Lebanon.<br>
<br>
In September the ICRC distributed a total of 35,600 food rations, 563,450 bags of rice (each of 25 kg), almost 384,000 jars of baby food, and over 16,000 baby kits, 26,000 hygiene kits, 5,500 household cleaning kits, 17,150 kitchen sets and 51,000 blankets.<br>
<br>
<br /><b><b>ICRC continues to support medical facilities</b></b><br />
<p><br>
The ICRC has continued to support government clinics and hospitals as well as medical facilities run by the Lebanese Red Cross and other health providers. Because the lack of electricity is still hampering the delivery of medical services, the ICRC has supplied several facilities with generators and is continuing to do so. In addition, the ICRC has distributed drugs for chronic diseases and various other medical supplies to facilities all over the country.<br>
<br>
During the past two weeks, the ICRC has also provided medications, cooking pots, bed sheets and pillows and mattresses for Fanar Psychiatric Hospital, south of Beirut near Sidon.<br>
