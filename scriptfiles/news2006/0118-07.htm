<p>WASHINGTON - January 18 - A new report released today by environmental and consumer organizations documents this winter's soaring natural gas and heating oil prices that are creating real hardships for many Americans.  </p>
<p>   The report, Stay Warm, Save Cold Cash, from the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC), Sierra Club and U.S. Public Interest Research Group, identifies simple, immediate steps for consumers to reduce their heat and energy costs this winter.  The report also urges the federal government to increase investments in efficiency and renewable energy.  These inexpensive, clean solutions are readily available, and can promptly lower energy bills. The report contrasts these solutions with polluting energy policies proposed by the administration and their allies in Congress.</p>
<p>   The full report, which includes nationwide and state specific energy use and conservation profiles, is available online at <a href="http://releases.usnewswire.com/redir.asp?ReleaseID=59398&Link=http://www.saveourenvironment.org/StayWarm2006.pdf">http://www.saveourenvironment.org/StayWarm2006.pdf</a>.</p>
<p>   "American consumers are struggling to pay for heating this winter because of wasteful energy policies designed to benefit Big Oil," said U.S. PIRG Legislative Director Anna Aurilio.  "Fortunately, consumers can take simple efficiency steps to stay warm and save cold hard cash."</p>
<p>   "The fact that so many families are facing a home heating crisis this winter is prime example of why the United States needs greater investment in energy efficient and renewable energy technologies," said NRDC Energy Advocate Jim Presswood.</p>
<p>   "By taking cost-effective, common sense actions, Americans can become more energy efficient and reduce their home energy bills," said David Hamiltion, director of the Sierra Club's Global Warming and Energy Program.  </p>
<p>   The Department of Energy's Energy Information Administration (EIA) recently released a forecast that said heating bills will be one-third to one-half higher for most families across the country this winter.  The sharpest increases are expected for those who heat with natural gas, who can expect to pay an average of $280 more during the upcoming winter compared to last year (an increase of 38 percent).  Additionally, consumers who heat their homes with fuel oil will pay $260 more (an increase of 21 percent).</p>
<p>   The fastest, cheapest, and cleanest way to relieve American families from the burden of high energy costs is through energy efficiency and conservation.  Today's report shows that by implementing simple solutions such as sealing up drafts in windows and installing programmable thermostats, the average American family could save up to $750 in heating costs each year. </p>
