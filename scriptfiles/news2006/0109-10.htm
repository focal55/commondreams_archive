<p> WASHINGTON - January 9 - AFL-CIO Secretary-Treasurer Richard Trumka called on Walgreen Co. (NYSE: WAG) to reform the company&rsquo;s pharmacy and labor practices to protect consumers. &ldquo;Walgreens pharmacy business and its pharmacists are critical to Walgreens operations, and patient safety depends upon high quality pharmacy staffing,&rdquo; explained Trumka. Sixty four percent of Walgreens sales are from prescription drugs. 
<P>In a letter to Walgreens CEO David Bernauer, Trumka cited a survey by the United Steelworkers International Union of Walgreens pharmacists in the Chicago and Northwest Indiana area that indicates a deep concern over pharmacy safety. The National Pharmacists Association, whose members participated in the survey, reports that many Walgreens pharmacists are filling in excess of 20 prescriptions per hour &ndash; a potentially dangerous level. </P><P>&ldquo;Working Americans rely on Walgreens to provide quality pharmaceutical services, and the retirement savings of America&rsquo;s working families are invested in companies like Walgreens,&rdquo; explained Trumka. </P><P>Pharmacist workloads are an important factor in pharmacy safety according to Trumka. According to a medical study by Auburn University, the risk of error increases along with the number of prescriptions filled per hour. The Auburn study demonstrated that &ldquo;the number of errors increases significantly&rdquo; between 20 and 24 prescriptions filled per hour, and any hourly average over 23.5 creates a &ldquo;high risk of making errors.&rdquo; </P><P>&ldquo;We urge the Board of Directors to conduct a review of Walgreens pharmacy workloads and labor policies. This process should be conducted in a transparent manner, and the results should be disclosed in a report to customers and shareholders,&rdquo; Trumka said. </P>
