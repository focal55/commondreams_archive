<p>WASHINGTON  - April 20 - "The story of this year's Congress is largely a tale of what didn't get done rather than lofty legislative accomplishments.  Echoes of Lyndon Johnson's famous campaign slogan lamenting a "do nothing” Congress are being heard for the first time in decades.  But whereas idleness among our lawmakers is usually a cause for concern, the American conservation community has reason to celebrate their paltry record of achievement.  Many of our key environmental protections were on the chopping block this winter and thanks to the vocal support of conservation-minded Americans and heroic members of Congress, most of them survived…for now.<br>
<br>
"We saw Senator Stevens and his obsession with drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge surface yet again, only to be rejected…yet again.  We held our collective breaths as the Senate pondered the future of the Endangered Species Act.  And we breathed a tentative sigh of relief as pro-conservation Senators stood their ground.   We applauded, as a single courageous man from Florida, Senator Bill Nelson, vowed to protect his state's coastline from disastrous offshore drilling at all costs.  And we cheered as a disastrous federal budget, chock full of cuts to key environmental programs, foundered and died amid internal GOP bickering, to name but a few areas of concern.<br>
<br>
"I have always seen Earth Day as a day of rebirth and renewal.  Can the stalling of these bills and the departure of Interior Secretary Gale Norton be seen as a new beginning?  With a Bush White House, probably not.  But I propose that for now, on our day, Earth Day, we celebrate it as such.  Let us take the day to savor our victories.  More fights will surely come our way, but let us take a moment to celebrate all that we have accomplished and the ever present possibility, however slight, of a new beginning.<br>
<br>
"On behalf of the entire Defenders family, I wish all our members and supporters and all those who care for our nation's wildlife and natural heritage, a very Happy Earth
Day.&quot;
