<p>LONDON - July 11 - 
<p><b>Internal armed conflict</b>
<ul type="disc">
<li>The internal armed conflict in Peru (1980 - 2000) confronted the Peruvian State and the armed opposition groups Shining Path and the Movimiento Revolucionario Tupac Amaru (MRTA).</ul>

<ul type="disc">
<li>23,969 people were killed or &#8220;disappeared&#8221; during the conflict &#8211; 79% came from rural areas and 56% were peasants (Peruvian Truth and Reconciliation Commission, 2003).</ul>

<ul type="disc">
<li>85% of victims of human rights violations during the conflict were poor (Peruvian Truth and Reconciliation Commission, 2003).</ul>
<b>Access to health today</b>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Around 25% of all Peruvians (around 6,500,000 people) do not have access to primary health attention (National Health Survey, 2000).</ul>

<ul type="disc">
<li>Most of the health budget is spent on richer areas &#8211; in 2005 around US$51 per capita was given to areas with richer populations and US$24 per capita to areas with high levels of poverty (CIES, 2005).</ul>

<ul type="disc">
<li>Lima, the richest city in the country, has 22 doctors, 11 nurses and 3 obstetricians for every 10,000 people. Huancavelica, one of the poorest cities of the country, has 4 doctors, 3 nurses and 2 obstetricians for every 10,000 people (INEI, 2003).</ul>

<ul type="disc">
<li>50% of Peru&#8217;s population doesn&#8217;t have access to medicines &#8211; 60% in rural areas (Pan-American Health Organization, 2002).</ul>

<ul type="disc">
<li>49% of the Peruvian population lives in poverty &#8211; 70% in rural areas (UN Special Rapporteur on Right to Health, 2004).</ul>

<ul type="disc">
<li>25% of the Peruvian population (around 6.8 million) lacks drinkable water &#8211; 40% in rural areas (National Ombudsman, 2005). </ul>
<b>Women </b>
<ul type="disc">
<li>410 out of every 100,000 women who give birth die during labour. This figure is superpassed only by Haiti, Guatemala and Bolivia -- the three poorest countries in the Americas (World Health Organization, 2004). </ul>
 
<ul type="disc">
<li>One woman dies in Peru every 8 hours due to birth complications (II National Health Conference, 2005).</ul>

<ul type="disc">
<li>Twice as many women die in poor areas across Peru due to birth related complications (Ministry of Health, 2005).</ul>

<ul type="disc">
<li>Most deaths of women and children &#8211; particularly those caused by labour complications, infections, and in the case of children by malnutrition and diarrhoea -- could have been easily prevented by adequate medical care. </ul>

<ul type="disc">
<li>90% of indigenous women living in communities in the district of Río Santiago, Amazonas department prefer to give birth at home due to traditional beliefs and practices (Binational development Plan survey). </ul>
<b>Children</b>
<ul type="disc">
<li>In Lima, Peru's richest city, 17 out of every 1,000 children born alive died at birth. In the country's poorest areas, the number rises to 89 of out every 1,000 (INEI, 2000).</ul>

<ul type="disc">
<li>45% of deaths across the country are of children under 5 years old (II National Health Conference, 2005).</ul>

<ul type="disc">
<li>25% of children under 5 have chronic malnutrition &#8211; between 75 and 80% in rural areas (Ministry of Health, 2002).</ul>
<b>Health services</b>
<ul type="disc">
<li><font face="Arial">In 2002, the Peruvian government created the Seguro Integral de Salud (SIS) (Integral Health Insurance) in order to guarantee basic health services for impoverished sectors of the population.</font></ul>

<ul type="disc">
<li>At the end of 2005, the Peruvian state adopted the first Human Rights Programme which included the issue of health as one of its priorities<font face="Arial">.</font></ul>
