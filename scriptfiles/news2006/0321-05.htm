<p>   <b>WHO:</b> Center staff:</p>
<p>   -- Robert Greenstein, executive director</p>
<p>   -- Richard Kogan, senior fellow</p>
<p>   -- Jim Horney, senior fellow</p>
<p>   The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities will hold a  conference call briefing Thursday, March 23 at 12 p.m. (EST) on  the Administration's proposed line-item veto legislation.  The  line-item veto proposal is expected to be the centerpiece of  budget legislation that the House Budget Committee could take up  after the St. Patrick's Day recess and that the Senate will  consider later this year.</p>
<p>   In conjunction with the briefing, the Center will issue a new  analysis which finds that the legislation is designed in ways  that shift considerably more power to the Executive Branch than  has been understood and that could invite abuse by the Executive.   For example, if the President proposed to cancel funds  appropriated for a program, Congress would have to vote on his  proposal within 18 days, but if Congress turned down the  proposal, the President could continue withholding the funds  until 180 days had passed.  If the fiscal year ended before the  180-day period did, the funds could expire, enabling the  President to kill programs even if Congress had rejected his  proposals to do so. </p>
<p>   The legislation also would give the President the ability to  press Members of Congress to support his budget and legislative  priorities by threatening to cancel appropriation items that they  favored if they did not support his priorities, and promising not  to cancel their favored items if they did support him.  As a  result, the Congressional Budget Office has indicated the  legislation could lead to increases, rather than decreases, in  the deficit if a President uses the new power to gain support for  tax cuts or spending increases he has proposed.</p>
<p>   Center briefers will assess these and other aspects of the  legislation.</p>
<p>   After opening remarks, the panelists will take questions.</p>
