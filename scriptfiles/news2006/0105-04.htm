<p>WASHINGTON - January 5 - Eighteen Members of the United States Congress sent a 
letter yesterday to US Treasury Secretary John Snow and Export-Import 
Bank President James Lambright, requesting that the US return its 
share of the $12.4 billion to be paid by Nigeria in arrears payments 
and debt stock by March 2006 as part of a deal reached with the Paris 
Club group of creditors.

<p>In October 2005, the Paris Club, including the US, agreed to cancel 
$18 billion of Nigeria's total debt of around $30 billion to these 
creditors. As part of the deal, however, Nigeria had to agree to pay 
$12.4 billion by March 2006 to the Paris Club. At the time civil 
society groups in Nigeria, the UK, and US raised strong concerns that 
this amount was urgently needed in Nigeria for AIDS, health, and 
education, instead of being sent to Northern creditors.

<p>As part of the deal, the US will receive a total payment of $396 
million by March 2006. The US share of the debt is held by the Ex-Im 
Bank and the US Agency for International Development.

<p>The Congressional letter, initiated by Rep. Donald Payne (D-NJ) and 
Rep. Maxine Waters (D-CA), welcomes "the significant cancellation of 
Nigeria's debt agreed to by the Paris Club group of creditors in 
October 2005. Nigeria has long been burdened by an unjust and 
unpayable debt burden, and we appreciate the role of the US 
government in securing this considerable debt write-off, which will 
mean that $18 billion of Nigeria's $34 billion debt will be fully cancelled."

<p>But the letter points out that in Nigeria "[o]ne in five children 
does not live to the age of five. In Nigeria, 2,500 children are 
dying needlessly every day from preventable diseases, and more than 
300,000 Nigerians die each year from HIV/AIDS." It goes on to quote 
UN special advisor Jeffrey Sachs who also urged the US and other 
creditors to not accept Nigeria's payment: "Twelve billion dollars in 
Nigeria could go a long way towards saving children, provide 
immunization, healthcare, education...  I say to the donors: 'Return 
that money'..."

<p>The US holds a smaller share of Nigeria's debt in comparison to other 
Paris Club creditors. The UK, Italy, France, and Germany are 
Nigeria's largest creditors. Parliamentarians and aid agencies in 
these countries have raised similar concerns with their own 
governments. In December, religious leaders and debt campaigners in 
the UK called for the UK Treasury to return its majority share of the 
Paris Club debt payment to Nigeria. Nine UK charity heads including 
the directors of Oxfam and Christian Aid wrote to Prime Minister Tony 
Blair urging him to refuse Nigeria's payment. This Congressional 
letter is part of that global effort.

<p>The letter also expresses concern that the Paris Club deal may 
strengthen the International Monetary Fund's "control over Nigeria's 
future economic policy choices through the implementation of the new 
IMF Policy Support Instrument, whose real ownership still remains to 
be verified." It points out that "much of Nigeria's debt can be 
considered odious given the fact that the original loans were made to 
authoritarian regimes - many of which were then looted while interest 
and penalties accumulated."

<p>Signatories pressed for "continued leadership by the US government to 
return this money to Nigeria's people thereby signaling its 
commitment to development and poverty reduction in Africa."
