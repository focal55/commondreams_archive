<p>WASHINGTON - March 3 - The Humane Society of the United States today urged Governor Haley Barbour to sign into law a bill that would impose a statewide ban on Internet hunting, a practice opposed by both sportsmen and animal welfare advocates alike. </P>
<P>Senate Bill 2041, led by Senator Lynn Posey, makes killing an animal by remote control over the Internet illegal in Mississippi. The controversial practice originated in Texas with launching of a web site, www.Live-Shot.com, that allows so-called hunters to pay a fee and shoot captive animals on an exotic game ranch from many miles away with the click of a mouse or the few strokes of a keyboard.</P>
<P>"The Humane Society of the United States is very pleased that Mississippi lawmakers have taken this important step to stop an egregious trophy hunting practice that amounts to nothing more than pay-per-view slaughter," said Michael Markarian, HSUS executive vice president. "Responsible hunters know there's no sport in shooting an animal remotely while lying in bed and wearing camouflage pajamas. We urge Governor Barbour to sign this bill into law now and snuff out this snuff film scenario." </P>
<P>Hunting via the Internet involves signing up on the web site and paying a deposit and fees of more than $1,500 to schedule a session. The final cost depends on the species and size of the animal killed and the cost of having the trophy mounted and shipped to the hunter's home. The hunter then logs on again at an appointed time and watches a feeding station on his computer screen. The animal ordered is present in the area, herded in front of the camera by on-site employees, and when the animal approaches the food, the hunter uses his mouse to line the victim up in the on-screen crosshairs. A click of the mouse fires the rifle.</P>
<P>The HSUS has been actively advocating for legislation to combat Internet hunting. To date, 14 states have adopted laws to ban Internet hunting, and bills to outlaw the practice are currently active in a dozen others. In addition to Mississippi, a bill to ban Internet hunting in Alabama was signed by the governor yesterday. </P>
<P>Due to concerns that Internet hunting ventures may move to other states or even off-shore, U.S. Representatives Tom Davis (R-VA) and Collin Peterson (D-MN) have also introduced legislation in Congress, H.R. 1558, to stop Internet hunting nationwide.</P>
