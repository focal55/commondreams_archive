<p>WASHINGTON - September 26 - Halliburton spent $4.6  million since 2000, buying influence in Washington via campaign  donations and lobbying, a HalliburtonWatch analysis reveals.</p>
<p>   The board of directors and their spouses personally gave  $828,701 to candidates for Congress and the presidency while  Halliburton's political action committees gave $1.2 million, most  of it donated to Republicans and political organizations with  strong Republican ties, according to the analysis.</p>
<p>   The company spent an additional $2.6 million lobbying members  of Congress, the White House and federal agencies.</p>
<p>   Conclusion: Halliburton's $4.6 million in political arm- twisting since 2000 has paid-off magnificently as the company's  government contracts ballooned by over 600 percent in value by  the end of 2005, mostly because of the war in Iraq.

<p>   In 2000, Halliburton was the 20th largest federal contractor,  receiving $763 million in federal contracts. By 2005, Halliburton  had grown to become the sixth largest federal contractor, receiving  nearly $6 billion in federal contracts during that year.</p>
<p>   Between March 2003 and June 30, 2006, Halliburton received  $18.5 billion in revenue from the federal government for the war  in Iraq.</p>
<p>   The company has seen its profits in government contracting  almost quadruple to $330 million in 2005 compared to $84 million  in 2004.</p>
<p>   During one quarter in 2005, Halliburton's war profits  skyrocketed by 284 percent.  Web: <a href="http://releases.usnewswire.com/redir.asp?ReleaseID=73168&Link=http://www.halliburtonwatch.org/news/earnings072205.html">http://www.halliburtonwatch.org/news/earnings072205.html</a></p>
<p>   War contracts, intensified violence in the Middle East and  record oil prices helped quadruple the stock price between the  March 2003 invasion of Iraq and March 2006. As a result, the  board of directors together saw the value of their stock holdings  in the company increase by over $100 million.

<p>   CEO David Lesar holds the largest number of shares of any  Halliburton official, owning 844,928 common shares and share  options as of March 1, 2006. The shares were worth $17.3 million  as the troops first rolled into Baghdad in 2003. Three years  later, on April 10, 2006, the shares were worth $66.8 million,  for a $49.5 million gain. Lesar sold an additional 631,071 shares  during the war at various stock prices for gross amounts totaling  between $12.9 million on March 20, 2003, and $49.9 million on  March 1, 2006.
