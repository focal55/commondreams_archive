<p>WASHINGTON - May 10 - Senators Gordon Smith of  Oregon and Chris Dodd of Connecticut have introduced new  legislation this week to provide a national strategy and  resources to reduce high death rates of mothers and children  throughout the developing world. </p>
<p>   The action came Tuesday following a new report by Save the  Children estimating that about 2 million babies die within the  first 24 hours of life and a total of 4 million die within the  first month of life, mostly from causes that can be prevented or  treated.  The full report is available at www.savethechildren.org</p>
<p>   Representatives Betty McCollum (D-MN) and Chris Shays (R-CT)  have introduced similar legislation in the House.  The House bill  is currently co-sponsored by an additional 38 members of the  House of Representatives.</p>
<p>   &quot;It is tragic that many of the causes of child and infant  mortality are preventable or treatable ailments,&quot; said Senator  Smith. &quot;We can make some of the greatest gains by achieving the  simplest goals. The reality is that it just requires the  dedication of a lot of resources.&quot; </p>
<p>   &quot;If these staggering and almost unfathomable numbers were  associated with an earthquake or hurricane, they would prompt a  worldwide and immediate reaction,&quot; said Dodd. &quot;Each of these  numbers represents a child and a life cut short. We can't simply  afford to idly sit by as this death toll climbs. </p>
<p>   This measure can help ensure that much greater attention and  resources are committed to hopefully help alleviate this growing  crisis.&quot; Entitled the Child Health Investment for Long-term  Development (CHILD and Newborn) Act, the legislation would do the  following: </p>
<p>   -- Double current funding for child survival and maternal  health initiatives and require the U.S/ government to develop an  integrated strategy for improving child and maternal health, and  to create an inter-agency task force (headed by USAID)  responsible for its implementation. </p>
<p>   -- Establish guidelines for child survival programs, including  building local capacity, collaborating with non-governmental  organizations and local partners, focusing on the poorest, and  coordinating with other donors. </p>
<p>   -- Require the administration to submit an annual report on  efforts to promote child and maternal health globally, as well as  an assessment of the US contribution toward achieving the UN's  Millennium Development Goals.</p>
<p>   -- Create a Child Survival Fund, the goal of which is to  achieve significant reductions in mortality rates for mothers,  newborns, and children under 5 years of age.
