<p>WASHINGTON / BRUSSELS / LAGOS, Nigeria - January 10 - Ten years after the first significant planting of Genetically 
Modified (GM) crops, no plants with benefits to consumers or the 
environment have materialized, despite renewed promises by biotech 
corporations, according to a new report by Friends of the Earth 
International. [1]

<p>"Contrary to the promises made by the biotech industry, the reality of 
the last ten years shows that the safety of GM crops cannot be ensured 
and that these crops are neither cheaper nor better quality. Biotech 
crops are not a solution to solve hunger in Africa or elsewhere," said 
in Nigeria Nnimmo Bassey of Friends of the Earth Nigeria.

<p>The biotech industry continues to misleadingly claim that GM crops play 
a role in solving world hunger, and the world's largest producer of GM 
seeds, Monsanto Company (NYSE:MON), keeps an objectionable influence 
over agriculture and food policies in many countries and international 
bodies. [2]

<p>Monsanto's influence over governments is so substantial that many 
countries bought the corporation's unfounded claims that GM crops are 
good for the environment and contribute to alleviate hunger.

<p>The 100-page report "Who benefits from GM crops? Monsanto and its 
corporate driven genetically modified crop revolution" concludes that 
the increase in GM crops use in a limited number of countries has 
largely been the result of the aggressive strategies of the biotech 
industry.

<p>"Monsanto has been in the driver's seat when the US, Brazil and other 
countries developed GM policies. In Paraguay and Brazil Monsanto 
products were grown even though they were forbidden and in Indonesia the 
company bribed government officials. Governments should stop serving the 
interests of big companies such as Monsanto and put the interests of 
their citizens and the environment first," said in Brussels Paul de 
Clerck of Friends of the Earth International.

<p>The Friends of the Earth International report comes just a day before 
the release of the "Global Status of Commercialized Biotech" report of 
the industry-sponsored International Service for the Acquisition of 
Agri-biotech Applications -which promotes GM crops as a key solution to 
hunger and poverty- and a week before the January 17 annual shareholder 
meeting of biotech giant Monsanto.

<p>The new Friends of the Earth International report states that:
<ul>
<p>* GM crops are not 'green'. Monsanto's Roundup Ready soybeans, the most 
extensively grown GM crop today, has led to an increase in herbicide 
use. Independent reports from the US show that since 1996, GM corn, 
soybean and cotton have led to an increase in pesticide use of 122 
million pounds (55 million Kilos). The intensive cultivation of soybeans 
in South America is fostering deforestation, and has been associated 
with a decline in soil fertility and soil erosion.

<p>* GM crops do not tackle hunger or poverty. Most GM crops commercialized 
so far are destined for animal feed, not for food, and none have been 
introduced to address hunger and poverty issues. GM crops in developing 
countries have been grown mainly as export cash crops. In Argentina, the 
second biggest producer of GM crops in the world, only 2% of the soya 
stays in the country. Other developing countries, such as Indonesia and 
India, have experienced substantial problems with Monsanto's GM crops, 
often leaving farmers heavily indebted.

<p>* The world's largest producer of GM seeds, Monsanto, has a formidable 
influence over governments and international bodies. The company is 
responsible for around 90% of all GM traits used around the world. 
Monsanto's success in overcoming regulatory hurdles and preventing the 
adoption of strong biosafety laws is well documented.

<p>* The biotech industry has failed to introduce the promised 'new 
generation' of GM crops with consumer benefits as well as "pharma' crops 
modified to contain pharmaceutical drugs. After 30 years of research, 
only two modifications have made it to the marketplace on any scale: 
insect resistance and herbicide tolerance. The biotech industry is still 
mostly focusing on the traits, crops and applications that it did in the 
1990s, and animal feed is the exclusive or primary intended use of most 
new-generation GM crops.
</ul>

<p>After ten years of GM crop cultivation more than 80% of the area 
cultivated with biotech crops is still concentrated in only three 
countries: the US, Argentina and Canada.
