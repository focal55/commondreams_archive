<p>SANTA CLARA, California - May 25 - Today  at Yahoo's (NYSE: YHOO) annual stockholder meeting, Amnesty  International USA (AIUSA), an activist shareholder of Yahoo's  stock, will challenge the company to uphold human rights in its  operations in China. AIUSA will call on the company to publicly  demand the release of internet dissidents jailed in China for  peacefully exercising their freedom of expression rights. Tens of  thousands of AI members have already written to Yahoo's CEO,  calling on the company to push for the release of Shi Tao, a  Chinese journalist now serving ten years in prison for sending  politically sensitive information in an e-mail using a Yahoo  account. Yahoo also provided information to the Chinese  government that could have contributed to the conviction of Li  Zhi, a civil servant who was jailed for eight years in 2003 after  posting comments that criticized government corruption.  </p>
<p>   During Yahoo's stockholder meeting on May 25, Anthony Cruz,  AIUSA's Corporate Action Network Coordinator for California, will  address Yahoo's stockholders, asking management to go on the  record calling for the release of Shi and Li. In addition, Cruz  will raise concerns about the company's long-time willingness to  operate behind the &quot;Great Firewall&quot; of China, agreeing to  actively restrict users by blocking content on topics such as  human rights, political reform, Tiananmen Square and Falun Gong,  among others. </p>
<p>   &quot;Yahoo is partnering with one of the world's most repressive  regimes to keep people from getting information and from writing  freely in e-mails and on Web sites. Internet censorship threatens  the very foundation on which the Internet was built. This doesn't  seem like a good business model for a company that needs more  free speech online to grow,&quot; said Cruz. </p>
<p>   Leading U.S. internet companies, including Microsoft (MSFT)  and Google (GOOG), have made similar concessions to the Chinese  to help with online censorship. Last week, Cruz addressed  shareholders at the Google annual meeting, where co-founder  Sergei Brin seemed to dodge questions about Google's conduct by  pointing the finger at Yahoo for helping put Chinese netizens in  jail.</p>
<p>   Cruz added, &quot;The bottom line is that none of these companies  operating in China have figured out ways to ensure their  customers get all the information and privacy online that they  are entitled to. The leaders of these companies are supposed to  be the smartest and most innovative thinkers in the world today.  Is bowing to an abusive regime really the best they can do?&quot; </p>
<p>   Appearing at the annual shareholder meetings is just one  component of a massive international effort led by Amnesty  International, the world's largest grassroots human rights  organization with more than 1.8 million members globally. Last  week AIUSA launched a comprehensive web-based action at:  <a href="http://releases.usnewswire.com/redir.asp?ReleaseID=66387&Link=http://www.amnestyusa.org/business/censorship.html">http://www.amnestyusa.org/business/censorship.html</a> , allowing  concerned Internet users to send direct messages to U.S.-based  technology giants, demanding they stop assisting foreign  governments in their attempt to curtail freedom of speech on the  Internet. </p>
<p>   In Congressional testimony, in meetings with the companies and  through their public actions, Amnesty International has made  several recommendations to the companies for addressing these  issues, including pressuring the Chinese government to release  internet dissidents and change their repressive practices and  adopting comprehensive human rights policies based on  international standards.</p>
<p>   Amnesty International supports the key provisions of the  Global Online Freedom Act of 2006, introduced in March by  Representative Chris Smith (R-N.J.). The legislation aims to  protect free and open communication online globally before  repressive countries succeed in developing an entirely separate,  heavily censored, widely surveilled, and restricted version of  the Internet. </p>
