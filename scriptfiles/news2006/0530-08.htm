<p>WASHINGTON - May 30 - Unless government officials  focus immediate attention on the critical housing needs of poor  people along the Gulf Coast, the region cannot possibly prepare  for the devastation future hurricanes will bring, warned Oxfam  America today.</p>
<p>   June 1 marks the start of the new hurricane season, but  throughout Mississippi and Louisiana, public officials have made  little effort to include the region's poorest families and  struggling workers in plans to recover from last year's back-to- back disasters.</p>
<p>   Hurricanes Katrina and Rita hit the region's most vulnerable  people hardest. They had the fewest resources on which to fall  back, yet they are benefiting the least from the billions of  federal dollars being spent on the recovery. Without a solid  investment in affordable housing for the coast's working poor,  the potential destruction from a new round of storms could  undermine the entire recovery process.</p>
<p>   To date, nearly half the Mississippi Gulf Coast residents  slammed by the storm are excluded from the state's plan for using  $3 billion in community development block grants. Many of them  are renters and uninsured homeowners whose dwellings were outside  the flood plain. They include children, elderly people, and  disabled residents.</p>
<p>   Of the 204,000 housing units in Louisiana destroyed or  severely damaged by Katrina and Rita, 41 percent of them were  occupied by renters. The state's Road Home plan for $10.4 billion  in federal assistance proposes spending 61 percent of that on  homeowner-related programs, or $6.3 billion. Affordable housing  and rental-related programs, on the other hand, are slated to get  just 15 percent of the total, or $1.5 billion.</p>
<p>   "To protect people from disaster, you need to protect them  from deepening poverty, too," said Oxfam President Raymond C.  Offenheiser. "If the Gulf Coast is serious about preventing  future disasters, it should start by making sure there is  affordable, safe housing for all its residents. Poor people need  to be at the center of every recovery effort."</p>
<p>   Oxfam America is a non-profit organization that works to end  global poverty through saving lives, strengthening communities,  and campaigning for change. Active on the Gulf Coast for the last  13 years, the agency made a decision after Katrina to launch its  first major humanitarian response within the United States.</p>
<p>   Since September, Oxfam has provided close to $1 million in  grant support to local leaders and community groups, including  those in Gulfport and Biloxi, Mississippi, and Plaquemines,  Terrebonne, and Jefferson parishes in Louisiana.  Oxfam has  helped these local partners develop resources that will provide  enduring improvements to the infrastructures of vulnerable and  impoverished communities in both Mississippi and Louisiana.</p>
