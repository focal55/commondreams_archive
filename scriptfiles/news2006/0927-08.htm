<p>WASHINGTON - September 27 - 

<p>ROBERT DREYFUSS, rcd48@cox.net, <a href="http://www.robertdreyfuss.com">http://www.robertdreyfuss.com</a>, 
<a href="http://www.tompaine.com/articles/2006/09/26/beware_the_nie.php">http://www.tompaine.com/articles/2006/09/26/beware_the_nie.php</a>Dryfuss wrote the piece "Beware the NIE" this week about the latest 
National Intelligence Estimate controversy. He is author of the book 
"Devil's Game: How the United States Helped Unleash Fundamentalist Islam."

<p>CAMILO MEJIA, Black65D@aol.com, <a href="http://freecamilo.com">http://freecamilo.com</a>A former Amnesty International prisoner of conscience, Mejia served 
nine months in a U.S. Army jail for refusing to return to his Florida 
Guard unit in Iraq, saying he did not want to participate in torture. 
His Iraq war memoir, "Road From Ar Ramadi: The Private Rebellion of 
Staff Sergeant Mejia," is forthcoming.
<p>    On March 15, 2004, just before surrendering to military authorities 
after refusing to return to the war, Mejia said at a news conference 
that morale among U.S. troops was really low because they lacked a sense 
of mission and because "we were all lied to about weapons of mass 
destruction and connections between Iraq and terrorism to justify the 
war. In reality, we're giving terrorism a reason to exist with this war."
<p>  Mejia said today that the worst outcome following the NIE "would be 
for the people of the United States to allow this 'new report' -- many 
of us have been saying this for years -- to be misused for political 
gain rather than for a more appropriate action: the withdrawal of all 
U.S. troops from Iraq."

<p>ANNE E. BRODSKY, brodsky@umbc.edu, 
<a href="http://www.accuracy.org/newsrelease.php?articleId=1347">http://www.accuracy.org/newsrelease.php?articleId=1347</a>Bush dines this evening with the presidents of Afghanistan and 
Pakistan. Brodsky is author of the book "With All Our Strength," which 
chronicles the experiences of Afghan women; she returned last month from 
her fifth trip to Afghanistan.

<p>STEVEN KULL, skull@pipa.org, <a href="http://www.pipa.org">http://www.pipa.org</a> Kull is director of the Program on International Policy Attitudes, 
which just released a poll that found that "seven in ten Iraqis want 
U.S.-led forces to commit to withdraw within a year. An overwhelming 
majority believes that the U.S. military presence in Iraq is provoking 
more conflict than it is preventing and there is growing confidence in 
the Iraqi army. If the U.S. made a commitment to withdraw, a majority 
believes that this would strengthen the Iraqi government. Support for 
attacks on U.S.-led forces has grown to a majority position -- now six 
in ten. Support appears to be related to a widespread perception, held 
by all ethnic groups, that the U.S. government plans to have permanent 
military bases in Iraq."
