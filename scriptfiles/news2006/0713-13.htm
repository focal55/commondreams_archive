<p>PAOLI, Indiana - July 13 - From July 8-13, 2006, 150 activists, young people, indigenous peoples, oil-affected communities, trainers and experts will gather for a five-day action camp in Paoli to learn how to end our national addiction to oil.  Bringing together youth from XX states, Inuit people from the Northwest Territories of Canada, evacuees from New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina, and some of the most experienced trainers in the U.S., participants will learn how destructive our national oil addiction is—and what they can do to begin to address the problem.

<p>With training in climbing, direct action, media work, basic organizing, and evening discussions on a future without fossil fuels, the camp aims to train a new generation of young organizers to address what many see as the crucial issue for youth.  

<p>The connections between oil burning and climate change have been scientifically verified again recently, as new studies linking carbon dioxide emissions to global climate change show. Yet the U.S. has yet to ratify the Kyoto protocols and still consumes over 1/4 of the world’s oil, contributing over 20 tons per person of carbon dioxide per year.  Currently, the demographic doing most to address our national addiction to oil is our youth, most of whom say they are struggling for their future, and the future of their planet.

<p>“Even President Bush said that our national addiction to oil needs to be a top priority, but we see no leadership coming out of Washington, and even less from the private sector,” said Global Exchange Independence from Oil organizer Mike Hudema.  “The biggest U.S. automaker—Ford Motor Company—is also the biggest polluter.  We see corporations and government officials pouring more funds into greenwashing campaigns than into actually protecting our environment. And the people who are going to pay the highest price for this lack of response are youth.  So we’re taking matters into our own hands, before it’s too late.”

<p>The camp also aims to connect oil dependence with wars overseas, destruction of indigenous peoples’ land and way of life, and other human rights and justice issues.  Recently, the Jumpstart Ford campaign—a project of the same coalition of groups organizing the camp that aims to pressure Ford to go to zero emissions by 2050—brought Omoyele Sowore, a Nigerian activist, to Ford’s shareholder’s meeting.  According to Sowore, “every SUV [Ford builds] runs on the blood of Nigerians.”  Trainers hope to illuminate the connections between instability in oil-producing countries to our insatiable demand for oil in the U.S., among other issues.

<p>The camp is organized by Global Exchange, the Rainforest Action Network and the Ruckus Society.  It is cosponsored by Energy Action and Oil Change International.
