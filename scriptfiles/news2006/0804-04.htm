<p>NEW YORK - August 4 - 
<p><b><a href="mailto:marylia@earthlink.net">MARYLIA KELLEY</a></b><br />
Kelley is executive director of Tri-Valley CAREs (Communities Against a Radioactive Environment) located in Livermore, California. She said today: "On August 6 and 9, 61 years after the U.S. dropped atomic bombs on the Japanese cites of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, people from around the globe will gather to stop nuclear weapons and war. In the U.S., our protests will not only commemorate the past, they will also reveal the oft-hidden face of continued nuclear weapons development. Presently, Livermore lab in California and Los Alamos lab in New Mexico are locked in a competition to design a new submarine-launched nuclear warhead, the first new nuke in a Bush administration initiative to re-design and rebuild every nuclear weapon in the U.S. arsenal, under the so-called 'Reliable Replacement Warhead' program. By taking action this August 6 and 9, we will honor the people of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, whose skin was seared from their bodies, and vow 'never again.' We will stand in solidarity with all victims of war. We will rededicate our lives to peace and work to prevent our government from developing new nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction."<br />
