<p>WASHINGTON - August 24 - Nancy Keenan, president of NARAL Pro-Choice America, applauded the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) long overdue decision to grant over-the-counter status to the emergency contraceptive Plan B&reg;, also known as the "morning-after" pill. </P>
<P>"Finally, the FDA put sound science before politics and made this safe, effective birth-control option more accessible to women," said Keenan. "The American public overwhelmingly supports increased access to the 'morning-after' pill as a way to prevent unintended pregnancy and reduce the need for abortion. "</P>
<P>NARAL Pro-Choice America has been a national leader in efforts to demand the FDA end its delay on approving over-the-counter access to Plan B&reg;. In its most recent campaign, NARAL Pro-Choice America channeled tens of thousands of messages to the FDA from its member activists, urging the agency to make this birth-control option available over the counter. </P>
<P>Keenan said the Bush White House and its anti-choice allies' interference in the FDA's process undermined the public's confidence in the agency's objectivity. She said the FDA's decision today could help restore that trust.</P>
<P>"Americans are tired of the divisive attacks on women's reproductive-health care," Keenan continued. "Finally, the FDA stood up to the Bush administration and its far-right base to help women prevent unintended pregnancy by guaranteeing greater access to the 'morning-after' pill. Americans owe additional gratitude to Sens. Patty Murray (D-WA) and Hillary Rodham Clinton (D-NY) who have been stalwart in their leadership throughout this fight. They refused to allow politics to interfere in an agency's ability to do what's right." </P>
<P>Emergency contraception, if taken within 72-120 hours after sex, is up to 89 percent effective at preventing pregnancy. Last month, after more than three years of delay, the FDA signaled that it was willing to consider giving women greater access to this safe, effective birth-control option. </P>
