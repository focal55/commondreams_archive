<p>WASHINGTON - October 6 -  The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals issued 
                            an order today that will enjoin the State of Arizona 
                            from implementing Proposition 200's voter ID requirements 
                            in connection with next month's November 7th elections. 
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            &#147;Proposition 200 is both unnecessary and discriminatory,&#148; 
                            said Barbara R. Arnwine, Executive Director of the 
                            Lawyers' Committee. &#147;Today the 9th Circuit honored 
                            our country's democratic constitutional promise by 
                            removing an otherwise insurmountable roadblock to 
                            tens of thousands of eligible Arizona citizens,&#148; 
                            added Arnwine.<br>
                            <br>
                            This legal victory will help ensure the fundamental 
                            right to vote for tens of thousands of Arizonans who 
                            otherwise would have faced unnecessary barriers to 
                            full participation in federal and state elections.<br>
                            <br>
                            Passed in 2004, Proposition 200 dramatically altered 
                            Arizona election law by (1) requiring citizens to 
                            present documentary proof of citizenship in order 
                            to register to vote, and (2) imposing a restrictive 
                            identification requirement as a condition of casting 
                            a ballot at the polls. For those voters who cannot 
                            meet its strict and unnecessary requirements, Proposition 
                            200 imposes a 21st century poll tax by requiring that 
                            voters purchase acceptable forms of identification. 
                            By creating a price tag to vote, Proposition 200's 
                            unconstitutional burden disproportionately disenfranchised 
                            Arizona's minority voters, Native Americans, the elderly, 
                            the disabled and students. <br>
                            <br>
                            Proposition 200's proof of citizenship requirement 
                            has already blocked nearly 21,000 Arizonans from registering 
                            to vote. The Court's order enjoins Proposition 200's 
                            registration proof of citizen requirements so that 
                            eligible voters can register before the October 9 
                            registration deadline, and enjoins Proposition 200's 
                            polling place identification requirements so that 
                            citizens can vote in this year's critical mid-term 
                            election.<br>
                            <br>
