<p>SAN DIEGO, California - July 21 - In gratitude for her “fearless leadership and personal sacrifice in service of democracy, peace, human rights and a future worthy of all the world's children,” the Backbone Campaign awarded Congresswoman Maxine Waters (D-CA) a Backbone Award, July 15, 2006 at Democracy Fest in San Diego. 
 

 <p>Bill Moyer, Executive Director and Founder of the Backbone Campaign presented the golden Backbone statuette, saying, “At the Backbone Campaign we take seriously the maxim about the people leading and the leaders following, but Congresswoman Waters represents one of the few exceptions. Congresswoman Maxine Waters has always been a tireless advocate for the poor and the oppressed, whether they live in her congressional district, other American cities and states, or the poorest countries in the world.

<p>"Congresswoman Maxine Waters came to the attention of the Backbone Campaign when she risked life and limb, (not to mention her career) flying to the Central African Republic to rescue President Bertrand Aristide from his involuntary expulsion from Haiti. We'd never heard of a U.S. member of Congress taking such a courageous position against a U.S.-sponsored coup d'etat. She was the principle sponsor of the Jubilee Act of 2005, calling for the cancellation of debts owed to international financial institutions by poor countries. Today, Representative Waters is the driving force behind the Out of Iraq caucus, which currently boasts 72 Congressmembers.

<p>“As an advocate for democracy, peace, and justice in her own district, other states and around the planet, Representative Waters is fearless and formidable. It is an honor and a pleasure and pleasure to present her this well deserved Backbone Award.”
<p>A video of Rep. Waters remarks after receiving the award can be found at <A

<p>The Backbone Campaign is a grassroots effort to embolden citizens and elected officials to stand up for progressive values. Founded by artists in Washington State, the Backbone Campaign provides creative tools for citizens and the progressive movement that focus on Accountability and Visibility, such as Backbone Awards, a 70-foot long Backbone Puppet, a Bush and Co. Chain Gang, Freeway Banners, Spineless Citations, and more.

<p>The Backbone Award is given to elected officials at the federal level who are consistently progressive and who have, in support of progressive principles, publicly displayed courage in politically lonely moments. Previous recipients include Senator Russ Feingold, Representatives Jim McDermott, Stephanie Tubbs Jones, John Conyers, Lynn Woolsey, Jesse Jackson Jr., Bernie Sanders, Cynthia McKinney, Dennis Kucinich, FCC Commissioner Michael Copps, and Governor Howard Dean. The Backbone Award is an original piece of art, generously created by artists Hans and Eric Nelsen of Vashon Island, Washington.
