<p>AMSTERDAM - August 21 -  Greenpeace International today called for a global ban on imports of US rice in order to protect the public from eating illegal, untested and unapproved varieties of genetically engineered (GE) rice.<br>
<br>
GE Liberty Link (LL) rice 602, produced by agro-chemical giant Bayer
and never intended for commercial release, has been found in commercial
rice in the United States and rice imports were, as a result,
immediately banned in Japan. <a href="http://www.easybourse.com/Website/dynamic/News.php?NewsID=44088&lang=fra&NewsRubrique=2">(1)</a> It is not approved for consumption or
cultivation anywhere in the world. <br>
<br>
"Rice is the world's most important staple food and contamination of
rice supplies by Bayer, a company pushing its GE rice around the world,
must be stopped," said Jeremy Tager, Greenpeace International GE
campaigner. <br>
<br>
Japan has already announced a ban on long grain rice imports from the
US as a result of this latest contamination scandal. Last year, Japan
and the EU banned US maize imports as a result of yet another GE
contamination scandal. <br>
<br>
"This latest contamination scandal once again shows the GE industry is
utterly incapable of controlling GE organisms. Countries that import US
rice, such as the EU, Mexico, Brasil and Canada must become serious
about preventing this kind of threat to our food supplies by banning
any imports of GE rice, removing all contaminated food from supermarket
shelves and rejecting applications for the commercial cultivation of
rice," said Tager. <br>
<br>
"Relevant authorities in importing countries must also conduct an
investigation into the contamination caused by Bayer and also determine
whether any other GE rice varieties being tested by Bayer have
contaminated the world's food chain," Tager concluded.</p>
