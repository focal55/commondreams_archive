<p>WASHINGTON - January 30 - Demos, a national, non-partisan public policy 
      organization, announced the launch of the new <EM>Democracy 
      Dispatches</EM> online. Published at <A 
      href="http://www.icebase.com/go.shtml?20060127160354362173&amp;m22094&amp;http://www.democracydispatches.org/">www.democracydispatches.org</A>, 
      <EM>Democracy Dispatches</EM> is a web-based news journal offering 
      commentary, blog-based analysis and an up-to-date newswire to provide 
      information about voting rights, election reform and democracy-related 
      issues in the United States. 
<p>Since 
      it was first published in print and online in 2001, <EM>Democracy 
      Dispatches</EM> has become a resource for reformers, journalists and 
      policymakers who need timely news and information on a range of voting 
      rights and election-related topics in the U.S. The all-new web-based 
      <EM>Dispatches</EM> format will build on a strong 5-year record of 
      reporting and analysis on a range of issues--voter registration, felon 
      disfranchisement, youth mobilization, voter ID, campaign finance, election 
      integrity, reform policy at the national and state levels, and others&#8212;with 
      comprehensive daily updates on the key challenges and opportunities to a 
      fair and just democracy. 
<p> Featured 
      writers include Sasha Abramsky, a leading national expert on felon 
      disfranchisement in the U.S.; Lorraine C. Minnite, Assistant 
      Professor of Political Science at Barnard College; Tova Wang, 
      Senior Program Officer and Democracy Fellow at The Century Foundation; 
      Stuart Comstock-Gay, Executive Director of the National Voting 
      Rights Institute; Ron Hayduk, Professor of Political Science, 
      Borough Of Manhattan Community College, Steven Carbo, Director of 
      Demos' Democracy Program; Miles Rapoport, former Secretary of the 
      State of Connecticut; and many others. 
<p> Throughout 
      2006, <EM>Democracy Dispatches</EM> will continue to expand its breadth 
      and scope to address issues beyond the current election reform landscape 
      and offer new ideas for creating a just and inclusive society in the 
      United States&#8212;"the democracy we deserve."</P>
