<p>SAN FRANCISCO - October 11 - Link TV will broadcast a four-hour special, “Oil, Katrina and The Big Spin” on Friday, Oct. 13, Saturday, Oct. 21 and Sunday, Oct. 29, beginning at 5p.m. PST and 8 p.m. EST.

<p>Part of a gripping collection of programs you must see before you vote in November, the special focuses on the two landmark events of President Bush’s second term — Hurricane Katrina and the continuing war in Iraq. Oil, Katrina and The Big Spin intends to cut through the confusion and help you make up your own mind about the critical events over the past few years, what’s real and what’s the spin. 

<p>Jerome Ringo, President of the Apollo Alliance, joins us in the studio to discuss our nation’s dependence on oil. Mr. Ringo is a former oil rig worker and is now Chairman of the National Wildlife Federation. 

<p>We’ll also see two films: “Big Easy to Big Empty” and “Oil Safari: The Travelogue of Addiction.”  In “Big Easy to Big Empty,” investigative journalist and author, Greg Palast, went to New Orleans to find out how the devastated city has recovered.  He reported back to Link TV and Amy Goodman for Democracy Now! and provides further insight into the government’s role in relief efforts.

<p>“Oil Safari” follows the oil from the Gulf of Mexico, from Iraq, from Venezuela, from war torn impoverished countries to the tanks of U.S. cars. Made by the Chicago Times and Pulitzer Prize winner Paul Salopek, the veteran foreign correspondent for the Chicago Tribune, the report reveals how our oil addiction binds us to some of the most hostile corners of the planet and to a petroleum economy edging toward crisis.

<p>Also featured: “Orwell Rolls In His Grave,” a film that moves us through a troubling list of questions and news stories that go unanswered and unreported in the mainstream media. Examining elections, the media and the spin, Robert Kane Pappas takes us beneath the surface of words into their political meaning where lies pass as truth.  By deconstructing the use of language handed down from the administration to the media we’ll see how certain messages infiltrate our shared belief system. 

<p>Linguist, Geoffrey Nunberg, who’s new book, “Talking Right,” will Link TV to examine how the Right has managed to label Liberals as “Tax Raising, Latte Drinking, Sushi-eating, Volvo-driving, New York Times Reading, Body-Piercing, Hollywood Loving freaks.”
