<p>WASHINGTON - August 8 - <br>
Here are ten easy tips to give your child’s lunchbox a nutrition makeover:
<p>1. Encourage your child to choose 1% or fatfree
milk. Milk is by far the largest source of
saturated fat in children’s diets. Choose 1% or
fat-free milk instead of whole or 2% milk to keep
children’s hearts healthy and arteries clear.
<p>2. Leave the cheese off sandwiches, unless
it’s low-fat or fat-free cheese. Though cheese
provides calcium, it is the second leading source
of artery-clogging saturated fat in kids’ diets.
Healthier sources of calcium include lower-fat
cheese, fat-free and 1% milk, low-fat yogurt, and
calcium-fortified orange juice.
<p>3. Switch from fatty luncheon meats to lowfat
alternatives. Supermarkets sell many good
tasting, low-fat or fat-free brands of turkey
breast, chicken breast, ham, bologna, and roast
beef.
<p>4. Include at least one serving of fruit in
every lunch. Try buying a new type of fruit each
week to let your child discover new favorites.
Try pears, sliced melon, cups of applesauce,
grapes, or pineapple (fresh or canned in its own
juice). Try serving fruit in cut into slices, cubed,
or with a yogurt sauce.
<p>5. Sneak vegetables – like lettuce or slices of
cucumber, tomato, green pepper, roasted
peppers, or zucchini – onto sandwiches. Eating
fruits and vegetables reduces your child’s
chances of heart disease, cancer, blindness, and
stroke later in life.
<p>6. Use whole grain bread instead of white
bread for sandwiches. Choose breads that list
“whole wheat” as the first ingredient. If the main
flour listed on the label is “wheat” or “unbleached
wheat flour,” the product is not whole grain.
<p>7. Limit cookies, snack cakes, doughnuts,
brownies, and other sweet baked goods. Sweet
baked goods are the second leading source of
sugars and the fourth leading source of saturated
fat in Americans’ diets. Low-fat baked goods can
help cut heart-damaging saturated and trans fat
from your child’s diet, but fat-free sweets can
still crowd out healthier foods like fruit.
<p>8. Limit potato, corn, tortilla, or other chips.
Save chips for a weekend treat. Fruits and
veggies should be the main side dish packed in
lunch boxes.
<p>9. If you pack juice, make sure it’s 100%
juice. All fruit drinks are required to list the “%
juice” on the label. Watch out for juice drinks like
Sunny Delight, Hi-C, Tropicana Twisters, and
Capri Sun, which are just sugar water with a tiny
bit of added juice.
<p>10. Don’t send Lunchables. Most Oscar Mayer’s
Lunchables get two-thirds of their calories from
fat and sugar. Making your own healthy
alternative is as easy as packing whole-grain
crackers, low-fat lunch meat, a piece of fruit and
a box of 100% juice (and it costs less!).
