<p>WASHINGTON  - May 11 - In his new book, &quot;<em>The Conservative Nanny State:  How the Wealthy Use the Government to Stay Rich and Get Richer</em>,&quot;  well-known economist Dean Baker debunks the myth that conservatives favor  the market over government intervention. The book examines a variety of  &quot;nanny state&quot; policies that make the rich richer while leaving  most Americans worse off. Baker, co-director of the Center for Economic  and Policy Research, candidly rejects current political truisms, proposes  alternatives, and encourages readers to openly debate the way forward. <br />

BOOK EXCERPT<br />
<br />
&quot;The key flaw in the stance that most progressives have taken on  economic issues is that they have accepted a framing whereby  conservatives are assumed to support market outcomes, while  progressives want to rely on the government. This framing leads  progressives to futilely lash out against markets, rather than  examining the factors that lead to undesirable market outcomes. The  market is just a tool, and in fact a very useful one. It makes no more  sense to&nbsp; lash out against markets than to lash out against the wheel.&quot;  (Excerpted from Preface)
