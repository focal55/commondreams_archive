<p>NEW YORK - May 11 - Today the Center for Constitutional Rights (CCR) welcomed support from 72 Members of Congress who filed amicus briefs in support of its challenge to warrantless spying, which asserts that the NSA Program is illegal and requests an injunction to bar further spying on Americans (CCR v. Bush).  The filing comes amidst new disclosures that the NSA Program has collected tens of millions of phone call records, amassing information about “the calls of ordinary Americans” with the cooperation of several telephone companies, according to an article in today’s USA Today. 

 

<p>“We are seeing mounting support for our challenge to warrantless spying and mounting evidence that the program is not only illegal, but illegal on a far more massive scale than the Bush Administration originally revealed.  For months we have been arguing in court that the NSA is spying on Americans without the warrants or judicial oversight required by our Constitution.  As Americans learn exactly how this spying personally affects them, the opposition to Big Brother government will continue to grow.  Despite all these developments, President Bush is attempting to promote the architect of illegal spying, when he should be fired,” said CCR Legal Director Bill Goodman.

 

<p>The U.S. Representatives’ brief explains that Congress never authorized the warrantless spying program, recounting the legislative history of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 and the Authorization for Use of Military Force in Afghanistan, and asks the court to halt the program immediately. 

 

<p>Shayana Kadidal, a CCR staff attorney on the case, welcomed the support from Members of Congress: “This important brief reiterates that Congress made all warrantless spying illegal and the NSA is currently breaking the law.  The brief explains that Congress did not declare open season for surveillance in America when it authorized war in Afghanistan.  President Bush and General Hayden have admitted they are spying on Americans without warrants, and we will keep fighting in court to stop them.”

 

<p>Congressman John Conyers, the Ranking Member of the House Judiciary Committee, one of two committees with jurisdiction over wiretapping laws, also released this statement today about his support for CCR v. Bush:  “As our brief makes clear, this Congress dealt with this issue authoritatively almost 30 years ago – warrantless spying on American soil is flatly prohibited.  As members of Congress, we have a special interest in ensuring that the President faithfully executes the laws we have passed.  The Church Committee spent years investigating the warrantless wiretapping of American citizens in the mid-1970s.  After receiving testimony from hundreds of witnesses, issuing 14 reports and collecting over 50,000 pages of records, this Congress carefully crafted the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.  To this date, that law stands as the exclusive and exhaustive authority to wiretap Americans in the name of fighting terrorism.” 

 

<p>The Representatives’ brief was filed late last night.  Several other amicus briefs have also been filed in support of CCR v. Bush, including briefs from a coalition of business leaders and the following organizations: the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), the League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC), the Japanese American Citizens League (JACL), the Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund (AALDEF), the Arab-American Anti-Discrimination Committee (ADC) and United for Peace and Justice (UFPJ).

 

<p>The Justice Department is expected to file its response to CCR’s motion for summary judgment in the case by May 19.
