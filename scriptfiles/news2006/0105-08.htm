<p>NEW YORK - January 5 - The Nation and Air America Radio announced today that beginning Saturday, January 7, they will launch "<a href="http://www.radionation.org">RadioNation With Laura Flanders</a>," hosted by author, activist and award-winning radio personality Laura Flanders. The show will be sponsored  by The Nation magazine, America's most widely read weekly magazine of politics and culture.

<p>Broadcasting each Saturday and Sunday evening from 7:00 to 10:00pm EST, "RadioNation with Laura Flanders" will feature news and programming from around the country, in-depth interviews, special remote broadcasts, a weekly journalists roundtable, as well as exclusive conversations with Nation writers and Nation Institute journalism fellows, Saturday night artists performing live, and coverage of Nation events. All with the cutting-edge political and cultural commentary Flanders is known for -- live, with callers! The show will also be available for listening online. 
<p>In an unprecedented example of a political talk-show bridging the waters between commercial and non-commercial radio, a weekly one-hour version of the show will also be available for broadcasting free of charge to non-commercial community and college stations. 
<p>"This exciting new collaboration," Nation editor and publisher Katrina vanden Heuvel says, "will give the magazine a valuable way of amplifying our principled, passionate and independent voice. And with Laura hosting, we know it will be a spirited and entertaining program."

<p>"Watch out and listen up," says Flanders. "Two power-house teams just got stronger. It's not a merger or a mind-meld -- it's a catalytic radio-reaction in the works."  Dubbed "Air America's weekend warrior woman" by Time Out New York, Laura Flanders is the author of the New York Times bestseller, Bushwomen: Tales of a Cynical Species, and a long-time broadcaster, in commercial and non-commercial radio.

<p>The program will be available on the web at <a href="http://www.radionation.org">www.radionation.org</a>.

<p><b>About The Nation<br>
</b>The Nation, founded by abolitionists in 1865, is America's oldest weekly magazine. Set forth in 1865, The Nation's editorial mission is to bring a "critical spirit" to the reporting and analysis of politics, social issues, economics and the arts, while remaining "independent from any parties or organizations." More than 140 years later, this spirit of informed dissent lives on in dispatches from the global frontlines of strife, unflinching exposes of political corruption and illuminating cultural reflections.
