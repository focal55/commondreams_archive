<p>WASHINGTON - March 7 - On the 41<SUP>st</SUP> anniversary of Bloody Sunday, the American 
Civil Liberties Union today launched a new campaign, "Every Voice. Every Vote. 
Renew the Voting Rights Act" to raise public awareness and urge Congress to 
reauthorize the expiring sections of the landmark Voting Rights Act of 1965. The 
campaign launch was marked by the release of two comprehensive reports that 
detail the need for the renewal of that historic civil rights law.
<P>"The right to vote is the foundation of our democracy, and an essential 
protection of that right is the Voting Rights Act," said Caroline Fredrickson, 
Director of the ACLU Washington Legislative Office. "Every voice must be heard 
and every vote must be counted. State and local governments continue to adopt 
voting laws, practices and procedures that deny equal access to voting - without 
the Voting Rights Act, there would be little protection against these efforts to 
deny some of us our right to vote. The Voting Rights Act is necessary to help 
ensure that every American citizen is able to exercise the franchise."</P>
<P>The launch of the campaign coincides with the release of two new ACLU reports 
outlining the continued need for the act. The first report, <a class=noline_blue href="http://www.aclu.org/votingrights/gen/24394pub20060306.html"><I>The Case for 
Extending and Amending the Voting Rights Act: Voting Rights Litigation, 
1982-2006,</I></a> is an 867 page report documenting 293 ACLU cases brought in 31 
states to protect the right to vote and challenge discrimination in voting.</P>
<P>"Our report makes it clear that minority voters have continued to face 
discrimination since the Voting Rights Act was last reauthorized in 1982," said 
Laughlin McDonald, Director of the ACLU Voting Rights Project. "While we have 
come a long way over the last twenty-five years, the expiring provisions of the 
Voting Rights Act are still necessary to ensure that minority voters are able to 
fully participate in the democratic process. Without these protections, it is 
likely that many of the advances of the past few decades would be wiped out by 
new barriers to voting."</P>
<P>The second report, <I><A class=noline_blue href="http://www.aclu.org/votingrights/gen/24396leg20060307.html"><I>Promises to Keep: The Impact of the Voting Rights Act 
in 2006</I></A></I>, details the practical effects of the Voting Rights Act and 
discusses the impact of the law in eliminating discrimination and granting 
access to the ballot box for minorities.</P>
<P>The ACLU has urged Congress to renew the provisions of the law that will 
expire in 2007 unless Congress reauthorizes them. The sections include: Section 
5, requiring jurisdictions with significant histories of discrimination in 
voting to get federal approval of any new voting practices or procedures; 
Section 203, ensuring that voters with limited English proficiency get the help 
they need at the polls; and Sections 6-9, authorizing the attorney general to 
appoint federal election observers where there is evidence of attempts to 
intimidate minority voters at the polls.</P>
<P>On Wednesday, ACLU President Nadine Strossen will testify before the House 
Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution and present the findings of the 
reports. Legislation to reauthorize the Voting Rights Act is likely to be 
introduced within the next several weeks.</P>
<P>The ACLU also unveiled a new educational poster that is being distributed to 
libraries, civil rights museums, and schools documenting the history of voting 
rights in the United States, as well as the latest episode of <I>The ACLU 
Freedom Files</I>, a revolutionary series from Robert Greenwald. "Voting Rights" 
-- which airs March 9 on Link TV and March 11 on Court TV -- documents how 
Native Americans, African Americans and other minorities fight for their right 
to participate in the democratic process.</P>
<P>As a part of the "Every Voice. Every Vote." campaign, the ACLU will conduct a 
nation-wide tour to discuss the Voting Rights Act reauthorization in Birmingham, 
Alabama, Nashville, Tennessee, Austin, Texas and in South Carolina. ACLU staff 
will be touring these cities throughout March and April to raise awareness of 
the act.</P>
<P>"Congress must reauthorize all of the expiring sections of the Voting Rights 
Act," said LaShawn Warren, an ACLU Legislative Counsel. "This renewal must 
happen without changes that would weaken the law&#8217;s original intent, to ensure 
that minorities have equal and unhindered access to the ballot box. 
Reauthorization of the act is a truly bipartisan effort. People of all political 
stripes agree that every American should have their right to vote 
guaranteed."</P><!-- #EndEditable -->
