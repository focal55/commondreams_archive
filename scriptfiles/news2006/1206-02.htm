<p>WASHINGTON - December 6 - The recipients of this year's Right Livelihood Awards (often referred to as the 'Alternative Nobel Prizes') arrived in Stockholm on Tuesday. They were speaking at a press conference in the Foreign Office Press Room on Wednesday morning 6 December 9:30 CET.

<p>Chico Whitaker (Brazil), co-initiator of the World Social Forum, said: “There are far more people in the world than we can ever imagine who want to change things. What we need is to multiply the ways and opportunities to get together.” 

<p>Daniel Ellsberg (USA), who leaked the so-called Pentagon Papers in 1971 and thus helped end the Vietnam war, said: ”It is urgent to prevent new U.S. aggression. The time is now for the world to say ‘no’ to U.S. threats of air attack against Iran, and to the very notion of a nuclear first-use ‘option’ by America or any other nation.”

<p>Ruth Manorama (India), who works for the rights of Dalit (also called untouchable) women in India, said: “Dalit women are victims of class, caste, and gender oppression. At present my work is building organisations to educate, agitate, and to organise Dalit women.”

<p>Fernando Rendón (Colombia), founder of the International Poetry Festival of Medellín, said: “Colombia is the victim of a terrorist complot, and poetry is the universal language that deciphers the riddle. The terrorism is state-sponsored, and poetry is the dream and the answer to the eternal challenge of a magnificent people.”

<p>More information on the recipients can be found at:
<a href="http://www.rightlivelihood.org/news/event06.htm">http://www.rightlivelihood.org/news/event06.htm</a><p>The Right Livelihood Awards will be presented in the Swedish Parliament on Friday 8 December at 18:00. A number of seats will be available for the press. Please call us if you would like to attend. There will be a webcast on our website.

<p>Founded in 1980, the Right Livelihood Awards are presented annually in the Swedish Parliament “to honour and support those offering practical and exemplary answers to the most urgent challenges facing us today”.
