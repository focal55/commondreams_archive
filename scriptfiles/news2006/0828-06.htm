<b><a href="mailto:beeton@cepr.net">JOHN SCHMITT</a></b><br />
Senior economist with the Center for Economic and Policy Research, Boushey said today: "This 'recovery' hasn't really been a recovery for the typical American family. ... At the same time, productivity has been rising, meaning that while the economy has been moving forward, American workers have not been receiving a fair share."<br />
<br />
Also a senior economist with CEPR, Schmitt said today: "Declining coverage rates in the Current Population Survey (CPS), which is the source of the annual official poverty estimates, mean that many of the non-working poor are falling out of the survey. We estimate that the number of Americans living in poverty today would be about 600,000 higher than reported if this important national survey had a coverage rate equal to that of the Decennial Census for 2000."<br />
