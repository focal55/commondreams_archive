<p>COLUMBUS, Ohio - January 25 -The American Civil Liberties Union today 
expressed deep concerns with the Ohio Department of Public Safety's new 
initiative, "See Something, Say Something," which encourages residents to call a 
toll free line if they witness something they believe is "suspicious." 
<BR>
&nbsp;<BR>"Programs such as this almost always prove to be ineffective in 
gathering information on possible terrorists," said Christine Link, Executive 
Director of the ACLU of Ohio. "Even though they are created with the best of 
intentions, they only serve to reinforce stereotypes and cause innocent people 
to be subjected to government scrutiny."<BR>&nbsp;<BR>The state's campaign will 
focus on distributing flyers and posters urging residents to report suspicious 
activity. Some of the cited examples of this type of activity include 
videotaping a government building or wearing bulky clothing on hot 
days.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>"Many people who vacation in Ohio videotape government 
buildings while they are sight-seeing," said Jeff Gamso, Legal Director of the 
ACLU of Ohio. "Calling that behavior suspicious and encouraging people to report 
will do nothing to prevent another terrorist attack and will only lead to 
innocent people coming under government scrutiny."<BR>&nbsp;<BR>The "See 
Something, Say Something" program lists a few organizations as co-sponsors, most 
notably the American Red Cross and the Ohio Hispanic Coalition.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>"It 
is especially disappointing to see that the Red Cross has departed from its core 
mission of rescuing and providing care for others in order to promote an 
ineffective program such as this," Link added.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>This newest 
initiative resembles the ill-fated Operation TIPS proposed by the federal 
government in 2002. TIPS was intended to set up a network of utility workers and 
postal carriers to spy on other Americans and report any "suspicious activity" 
to a tip line. The program was eventually suspended because of increasing 
concerns over privacy and the possibility that it might have encouraged racial 
profiling.</P>
