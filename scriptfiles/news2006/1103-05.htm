<p>WASHINGTON - November 3 - The AFL-CIO will hold a post-election briefing to release unique Election Day polling of union members nationally and in battleground states and to analyze the impact the union vote had on the elections.  AFL-CIO President John Sweeney, Political Director Karen Ackerman, and AFSCME President and AFL-CIO Political Committee Chair Gerald McEntee will be joined by Geoff Garin and Guy Molyneux of Peter D. Hart Research Associates for the 12:30 briefing at the AFL-CIO headquarters on Wednesday, November 8.  Union activists from battleground states will also join the press briefing.

 

<p>The AFL-CIO GOTV program is the largest organizational turnout program in the nation, focused on electing candidates who will champion working families’ priorities.

 

<p>The program reaches out to more than 13.4 million union voters in 32 states and in 175 electoral races at all levels. 

 

<p>The AFL-CIO identified 2.6 million drop-off voters in 2006, contacting them as many as 25 times throughout the course of the program.  Overall, the AFL-CIO has made more than 10 million phone calls and sent more than 11 million pieces of mail urging union voters, including drop-off voters, to get to the polls on November 7.  More than 100,000 volunteers are going door-to-door for the AFL-CIO’s “Final Four” GOTV push in the final four days of the election.  

 

<p>The AFL-CIO is also holding an election night watch party on Tuesday, November 7 starting at 8 p.m. at AFL-CIO headquarters building.
