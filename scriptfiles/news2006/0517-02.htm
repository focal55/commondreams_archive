<p>WASHINGTON - May 17 - Halliburton Watch is co- releasing its third annual report on the company at the company's  annual stockholder meeting, which is being held today in Duncan,  Okla.  The report, &quot;Hurricane Halliburton : Conflict, Climate Change  and Catastrophe,&quot; is available here:  <a href="http://releases.usnewswire.com/redir.asp?ReleaseID=65950&Link=http://www.halliburtonwatch.org/reports/houston2006.pdf">http://www.halliburtonwatch.org/reports/houston2006.pdf</a></p>
<p>   Halliburton Watch also launched the &quot;Give It Up, Cheney&quot; campaign, calling on the vice president to relinquish his remaining stock  holdings in Halliburton.</p>
<p>   Cheney, who was Halliburton's CEO from 1995 to 2000, continues to hold 50,000 stock option shares worth a gross value of $3.76 million  as of May 15, 2006.</p>
<p>   Cheney's 2005 public financial disclosure report was filed with  the Office of Government Ethics on Monday. The Vice President  reported that he also has thousands of stock options in Lockheed- Martin, Electronic Data Systems and Proctor and Gamble. In addition, Cheney received numerous personal gifts in 2005, including three  guns and a hunting decoy.</p>
<p>   The relevant pages from his financial disclosure report are  posted at: <a href="http://releases.usnewswire.com/redir.asp?ReleaseID=65950&Link=http://www.giveitupcheney.org/disclosure.html">http://www.giveitupcheney.org/disclosure.html</a></p>
<p>   &quot;The stock options create the appearance of an ongoing conflict of interest at the highest levels of government,&quot; said Charlie Cray, co-director of HalliburtonWatch.org. &quot;We call on the Vice President  to give up his remaining Halliburton options immediately and  eliminate the appearance of a conflict of interest they continue to  represent between his governmental duties and his interest as a  stockholder in the nation's number one Iraq war contractor.&quot;</p>
<p>   Cheney has signed a gift agreement, which stipulates that the proceeds of his Halliburton options will go to charity. To see the agreement, go here: <a href="http://releases.usnewswire.com/redir.asp?ReleaseID=65950&Link=http://www.giveitupcheney.org/agreement.html">http://www.giveitupcheney.org/agreement.html</a></p>
<p>   The &quot;Give It Up, Cheney&quot; campaign suggests Cheney consider  donating the proceeds from his remaining Halliburton stock options  to the following charities that work with Iraq war veterans:</p>
