<p>WASHINGTON - January 24 - On September 27, 2002, the District of Columbia Metropolitan Police Department,

  working with federal law enforcement authorities, undertook a political sweep and mass

  arrest of people who were engaged in, or in proximity to, First Amendment protest

  activities against the IMF and World Bank and the war in Iraq. The police trapped and

  arrested nearly four hundred protestors, NLG legal observers, tourists and passers-by in

  Pershing Park in downtown Washington, D.C. Despite never being allowed to leave the

  park, and no order ever being given for people in the park to disperse, all those swept up

  were charged with "failure to obey" an unidentified order that was never given.

  

<p>  The D.C. Circuit ruled that "The mass arrest at Pershing Park violated the clearly

  established Fourth Amendment rights of plaintiffs. . ." The Court of Appeals ruling

  rejected the appeal by Chief of Police Charles H. Ramsey, in which Ramsey claimed that

  he should not be held personally liable for these sweeping constitutional rights violations,

  clearing the way for a trial on Ramsey's responsibility. The Court also upheld the District

  Court's denial of qualified immunity to Assistant Chief of Police Peter Newsham who

  also commanded the arrests.

  

<p> Plaintiffs, who are representatives of a certified class action, Barham et al. v Ramsey et

  al, are represented by Mara Verheyden-Hilliard and Carl Messineo of the Partnership for

  Civil Justice (PCJ), also litigating on behalf of the National Lawyers Guild Mass Defense

  Committee.

  

<p>  "A police badge is not a shield from personal responsibility. Those who use their

  authority to target and jail others for engaging in free speech and political action must

  know that they cannot act with impunity," stated Ms.Verheyden-Hilliard. "This ruling is

  a vindication for the Barham plaintiffs who have been steadfast in insisting on

  accountability at the highest levels for this massive violation of constitutional rights."

 

<p> Heidi Boghosian, Executive Director of the National Lawyers Guild said:  "The unlawful

  tactics of law enforcement, including mass false arrests of persons exercising their First

  Amendment rights, are being challenged by NLG lawyers across the country. The

  government, by not seeking restraint of such behavior, has acted as a cheerleader for

  police who regularly use excessive force and abuse their authority to silence dissent. The

  ruling in Barham is a landmark step in holding top police officials accountable."

  In this appellate case, PCJ successfully defeated the defendants' arguments that they

  could treat the protestors and those in proximity as a group, using a criminal enterprise

  theory to justify the mass arrests. The Court agreed with plaintiffs that the defendants had

  failed to show a required particularized probable cause for each individual taken into

  custody, noting that they had failed to present evidence that such probable cause existed

  for even a single one of the hundreds of arrests.

 

<p>PCJ has filed a series of lawsuits challenging the practices of the District of Columbia

  M.P.D., the F.B.I., and other law enforcement agencies which, acting jointly, participate

  in unconstitutional tactics to disrupt lawful protest and assembly and unlawfully use mass

  arrests as a means to sweep political activists off the street and truncate demonstration activity.

  

<p>  The case is Barham et al. v Ramsey et al., No.04-5388, slip opinion (D.C. Cir. Jan 13,

  2006). The opinion is available at <a href="http://www.JusticeOnline.org">www.JusticeOnline.org</a>.
