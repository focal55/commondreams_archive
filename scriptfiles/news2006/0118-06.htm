<p>WASHINGTON - January 18 - MoveOn.org Political Action launched a nationwide anti-corruption campaign this morning at a protest rally aimed at Grover Norquist, the long-time Republican operative and associate of now-infamous lobbyist Jack Abramoff, who hatched the K Street “Pay to Play” Project with former House Majority Leader Tom Delay and Senator Rick Santorum.

 

<p>Waving signs reading “Stop Corruption,” over 100 members of MoveOn and allied organizations gathered outside the infamous “Wednesday Group” meeting of right-wing activists, Republican Hill and administration staffers and other operatives chaired by Norquist. MoveOn members were joined by members of the Campaign for America’s Future and Public Campaign Action Fund.  

 

<p>With his allies DeLay, Santorum and Abramoff, Norquist created a scheme to ensure that lobbying firms, most of whose offices are located on K Street, would only hire Republicans and would make large contributions to GOP political action committees and candidates in order to secure passage of legislation for their clients.

 

<p>“This meeting is the scene of the crime for Republican corruption scandals,” said Tom Matzzie, Washington Director of MoveOn.  “MoveOn members and the American people agree, it is time to end corruption by Republicans in Congress.”

 

<p>On the weekend of January 27-29, MoveOn members will take part in an anti-corruption “Weekend of Action” with grassroots events around the country, primarily in competitive congressional races.

 

<p>A new television ad is slated for later in the campaign.

 

<p>MoveOn members are calling on Congress to, as the first order of business, pass real ethics and lobbying reform with teeth. Real reform would enforce and toughen the rules; ban trips, gifts and meals; close the revolving door between lobbying and Congress; shut down “pay-to-play” schemes; end cronyism and shine a light on legislation and lobbying with transparency and public disclosure. Ultimately we need full public financing of elections but that reform is anathema to the Republicans running Congress.
