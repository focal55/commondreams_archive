<p>WASHINGTON - October 31 - The Sierra Club Political Committee today launched two new radio ads in the Pittsburgh, PA and Virginia Beach, VA areas targeting two Representatives' records of consistently siding with President Bush and Big Oil and voting against environmental protections. Each ad goes up Tuesday, October 31 and will run through next Monday, November 6.
<P>Both ads focus on the Representatives' close ties to energy industry and their subsequent votes to help polluting industries, instead of embracing forward-thinking solutions to our energy needs in ways that also protect the environment.</P>

<P>PA-4--Melissa Hart</P>

<P>Sierra Club Political Committee, Radio :60</P>

<P>"Hart-Ache"</P>

<P>You've all heard the old saying: we all need someone we can count on. And President Bush and the oil companies can certainly count on Melissa Hart.</P>

<P>She votes with the President almost 90% of the time, and when the oil and gas companies need a friend, they count on Melissa Hart too.</P>

<P>They have given her over $100,000 in campaign contributions. And she voted not to clamp down on the oil industry for price gouging and for the Bush energy bill that gave Big Oil and gas billions in tax dollars, when we were paying record-high gas prices</P>

<P>It's time to elect someone who's on our side, who will break the chokehold big oil has on Congress and on Melissa Hart. On November 7th vote for change. Vote for Jason Altmire</P>

<P>VA-2-- Thelma Drake</P>

<P>Sierra Club Political Committee, Radio :60</P>

<P>"Did You Know"</P>

<P>Care about Virginia Beach? Wouldn't it be great if Thelma Drake did too? The beach is the anchor of our economy --Three million tourists spend more than half a billion dollars a year in Virginia Beach.</P>

<P>But instead of protecting our city's most valuable resource, Congresswoman Thelma Drake took tens of thousands of dollars from the oil industry,</P>

<P>And then voted to allow oil drilling off Virginia's coast, opening us up to the threat of a devastating spill.</P>

<P>Drake also refused to clamp down on the oil industry for price gouging .. when we were paying record-high gas prices.and to cut funds that would keep sewage off our beaches -- the kind of sewage that has closed our beaches before. </P>

<P>Care about Virginia's beaches? Then vote for change, vote for Phil Kellam on November 7th. </P>
