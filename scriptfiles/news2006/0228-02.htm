PORT MORESBY, Papua New Guinea - February 28 - Greenpeace today 
launched a major initiative to help protect Asia Pacific's last 
remaining ancient rainforests - the so-called 'Paradise Forests' (1) - 
by unveiling its Global Forest Rescue Station in a remote part of Papua 
New Guinea.

<p>"Papua New Guinea's Kuni tribe has invited Greenpeace to set up this 
'Global Forest Rescue Station' on their land. It will be a base to 
fast-track boundary marking the tribe's territories to save them from 
the logging industry and to showcase eco-forestry initiatives to the 
world," said Greenpeace Australia Pacific's Chief Executive Officer, 
Steve Shallhorn.

<p>Greenpeace volunteers from around the world will live and work alongside 
local landowners and eco-forestry trainers at the Global Forest Rescue 
Station, sited at Lake Murray in Western Province. They will help three 
Lake Murray tribes establish their rights over approximately 300,000 
hectares of tribal territories by identifying, marking out and mapping 
their boundaries. This will help them protect the forests from 
destructive and illegal logging.

<p>The launch was heralded by the arrival in Port Moresby of the Greenpeace 
ship Rainbow Warrior, which received a traditional welcome by tribal 
groups and landowners. Ken Mondiai, Head of the EcoForestry Forum, a 
network of environment groups working with Greenpeace, said: "We are 
honoured to welcome the Rainbow Warrior to mark the beginning of this 
exciting new approach to eco-forestry in Papua New Guinea.

<p>Kuni clan leader, Sep Galeva, said:  "We want to say no to loggers who 
come in and destroy everything. We want to do small scale logging by the 
landowners in a way that is sustainable and environment friendly."

<p>The Paradise Forests are being logged faster than any other on Earth. In 
Papua New Guinea, less than one per cent of them have any form of 
protection and more than a quarter of a million hectares of primary 
forest are destroyed each year. Globally, an area of ancient forest the 
size of a football pitch is destroyed every two seconds to grow products 
like soya for animal feed or to make products like toilet paper, wooden 
flooring and plywood.

<p>"This new initiative is part of a global effort to protect the world's 
last ancient forests (2). Unless action like ours in Papua New Guinea is 
taken worldwide, vast numbers of species of plants and animals will 
become extinct, rainfall patterns will be disrupted and the global 
climate will change even faster than it is now," said Greenpeace Asia 
Pacific Chief Executive Officer, Steve Shallhorn.

<p>After Port Moresby, the Rainbow Warrior will sail on "Forest Crime 
Patrol" to draw attention to ongoing illegal logging across the entire 
region and to promote sustainable forestry.

<p>Notes to Editors:<br>

(1) The Paradise Forests stretch from South East Asia, across the 
islands of Indonesia and on towards Papua New Guinea and the Solomon 
Islands in the Pacific. <br>

(2) The Global Forest Rescue Station is part of the Greenpeace campaign 
to highlight the crisis faced by the forests and oceans in  Asia Pacific 
and the rest of the world. In the lead up to the Summit for Life on 
Earth, the meeting of the UN Convention on Biological Diversity which 
begins on March 20th in Brazil, Greenpeace is calling on governments to 
establish a comprehensive network of protected areas around the world 
with effective law enforcement and management.
