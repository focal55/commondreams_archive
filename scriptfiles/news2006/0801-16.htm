<p>WASHINGTON - August 1 - Following is a statement by Dr. Francesca Grifo, senior scientist and director, Scientific Integrity Program, Union of Concerned Scientists:

<p>"Today, the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee considered the nomination of Andrew von Eschenbach to head the Food and Drug Administration. Multiple senators warned that the agency is in crisis and questioned the nominee regarding several recent reports of significant political interference in science."

<p>"UCS released a survey of FDA scientists July 20 that documents how science at the agency is being compromised. 561 scientists said that FDA leadership does not 'consistently stand behind scientific staff or managers who put forth scientifically defensible positions that may be politically controversial.' Furthermore, 497 scientists said the agency is not moving in the right direction.

<p>"An open and unfettered scientific culture must exist within the FDA if the agency is to fulfill its mission of protecting and advancing public health and safety. FDA scientists must be able to speak openly about their work both inside and outside the agency and should be protected when they expose misuse of science. Furthermore, more comprehensive guidelines will be necessary to fully address both conflicts of interest and the more subtle kinds of influence described by survey respondents.

<p>"Inappropriate interference in science is putting people in harm's way. The FDA's current leaders should act now to improve transparency and accountability and renew respect for independent science at the agency. We look forward to monitoring the agency's progress in achieving these results."
