<p>WASHINGTON - December 14 - Corporate executives and former military commanders said today that increasing vehicle fuel economy represents "the single most effective step" the government can take to reduce America's oil dependence and increase its security. The group, the Energy Security Leadership Council, a project of Securing America's Future Energy, called for increased fuel economy standards for cars, delivery trucks and 18-wheelers, as well as a shift to alternative fuels.

<p>"This group could well change the tenor of the debate over how to solve the nation's oil addiction," said David Friedman, director of vehicles research at the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS). "Major corporate leaders understand the impact our oil addiction has on their businesses and shareholders, while military leaders have felt the real costs of that addiction on the front lines. These leaders know how to ask the hard questions and find ways to get difficult things done."
 
<p>FedEx chief Fredrick Smith said higher fuel economy standards should apply to his company's vehicles despite a small increase in their initial costs, clearly recognizing that saving money on fuel will provide benefits to shareholders. A recent UCS analysis confirms that consumers will benefit as well.  An SUV that gets 36 miles per gallon could be produced with the same size, performance and even improved safety compared to today's Ford Explorer, but would save consumers over $4,000 even after paying for the improved technology with gasoline at $2.50 per gallon.
 
<p>While the CEOs and military leaders advocate increased drilling of conventional oil, their own numbers show that this would have minimal impact since the U.S. has at most three percent of the world's oil reserves, yet uses 25 percent of the world's oil.

<p>"They understand that we simply cannot drill our way out of our oil addiction," said Friedman. "We urge these leaders to further increase their focus on increased vehicle efficiency and complimentary alternative fuel approaches."
 
<p>Formed in 1969, the Union of Concerned Scientists is the leading science-based nonprofit working for a healthy environment and a safer world.
