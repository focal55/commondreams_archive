<p>WASHINGTON - April 19 - More than 1,000 Amnesty International activists, primarily  students, from more than 10 states will converge in New York City  on April 21 for a series of demonstrations at foreign consulates  and United Nations (U.N.) missions to protest human rights abuses  in Sudan, China, Guatemala and Ethiopia. The demonstrations are  part of the 11th annual "Get on the Bus" (GOTB), organized by  Amnesty International USA Group 133, of Somerville, Mass.
<p>   At the Sudanese mission to the U.N., activists will bring  attention to the ongoing conflict in Darfur -- which has included  systematic and wide-scale murder, rape, abduction and  displacement -- and demand that the Sudanese government provide  protection for civilians in Darfur and allow unfettered access to  humanitarian relief. At the Chinese Consulate, activists will  protest Internet censorship by the Chinese government and  highlight the case of Shi Tao, who was sentenced to 10 years in  prison after sending a single message from his Yahoo! e-mail  account. Amnesty International considers Shi Tao to be a prisoner  of conscience.</p>
<p>   At the Guatemalan consulate, the demonstration will highlight  the failures of authorities there to adequately investigate the  murders of more than 1,900 young women, or to bring their killers  to justice. Outside the Ethiopian mission to the U.N., activists  will protest that government's brutal political crackdown on the  opposition and human rights activists following the May 2005  election.</p>
<p>   The day will start with a panel of experts speaking on each of  these issues. In the afternoon, Amnesty International will also  celebrate a piece of good news: a small delegation of anti-death  penalty activists will present a certificate of appreciation to  New York State Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver for his opposition  to restoring the death penalty in New York.</p>
<p>   WHO: Amnesty International activists from across the Northeast </p>
<p>WHEN: Friday, April 21</p>
