<p>WASHINGTON - February 15 - A new analysis by one  of the nation's leading health economists finds that the  Administration's proposals to expand tax breaks for Health  Savings Accounts (HSAs) would cause a net increase in the number  of uninsured Americans.  </p>
<p>   The analysis, conducted by Jonathan Gruber of M.I.T., projects  that while 3.8 million previously uninsured people would gain  health coverage through HSAs as a result of the President's  proposals, 4.4 million people would become uninsured because  their employers would respond to the new tax breaks by dropping  coverage and they would not secure coverage on their own.  The  net effect would be to increase the number of uninsured Americans  by 600,000.  </p>
<p>   &quot;The Administration estimates that its HSA-related tax  proposals would cost $156 billion over the next ten years, which  would worsen the nation's fiscal problems,&quot; Robert Greenstein,  the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities' executive director,  noted.  &quot;Professor Gruber's study raises very serious questions  about the wisdom of these proposals.&quot;</p>
<p>   Under current law, individuals who enroll in high-deductible  health plans (at least $1,050 for individuals or $2,100 for  families) can contribute to a HSA.  Contributions to HSAs are tax  deductible, earnings on the HSA accounts accumulate tax free, and  withdrawals from the accounts are tax free if used for qualified  medical expenses.  </p>
<p>   In its new budget, the Administration proposes substantial  additional tax subsidies designed to encourage more people to  open HSAs, such as providing a tax credit as well as a deduction  for contributions to HSAs, making the premium costs for HSA- related health plans tax deductible (and providing a tax credit  for them as well), providing a tax credit for low-income  households that purchase high-deductible insurance in the  individual market in conjunction with an HSA, and increasing the  amount that can be deposited in a HSA each year to $5,250 for an  individual and $10,500 for a couple or family.</p>
<p>   These proposals would eliminate all tax advantages for  employer-sponsored coverage (as compared to coverage purchased in  the individual health insurance market).  Those tax advantages  were designed to encourage employers to provide insurance to  their workers.  As a result, some employers -- typically, small  business owners -- would respond to the new HSA tax breaks by  dropping coverage for their workers or (in the case of new  businesses) electing not to offer coverage in the first place.</p>
<p>   To estimate the impact of these proposals on health coverage,  Professor Gruber employed a micro-simulation model that is very  similar to models used by the Congressional Budget Office, the  Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation, and the Treasury  Department.  His findings include:</p>
<p>   -- Under the proposed tax breaks, the number of people with  individual health coverage would increase by 8.3 million when the  proposals were fully in effect.  Some 3.8 million of these people  would previously have been uninsured; about 4 million of them  would have switched from employer-sponsored coverage to  individual coverage coupled with an HSA; and 500,000 would  previously have received coverage through Medicaid.</p>
<p>   -- Some 8.9 million people would lose employer-sponsored  coverage as a result of the tax breaks.  About half of them --  4.4 million people -- would become uninsured, while another 4  million would switch to individual coverage coupled with an HSA,  and 500,000 would enroll in Medicaid.</p>
<p>   Adding to the concerns that Professor Gruber's paper raises,  Greenstein said, is the strong probability that the currently  uninsured people who would be most likely to gain coverage as a  result of the Administration's proposals would be relatively  healthy, since they would best be able (with the help of the new  tax subsidies) to obtain affordable coverage in the individual  market.  In contrast, the people most likely to become uninsured  would be less-healthy employees in small businesses that dropped  coverage, since less-healthy people have the most difficult time  obtaining affordable coverage in the individual market.</p>
<p>   In addition to his position at M.I.T., Professor Gruber is  director of the Program on Children at the National Bureau of  Economic Research, a co-editor of the Journal of Health  Economics, associate editor of the Journal of Public Economics,  and the recipient of numerous awards for outstanding work in the  economics field.  </p>
