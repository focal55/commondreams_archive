<p>NEW YORK - July 17 - A new report from The Century Foundation calls for an overhaul of the unemployment insurance system, with uniform eligibility rules and compensation levels across all states. It also proposes that a new wage insurance program be created to encourage a quick return to the workforce for individuals who lose their jobs. According to the report, these two straightforward and complementary reforms would go a long way toward strengthening the economic security of Americans against the risk of losing their jobs.

<p>"Creating a Softer Economic Cushion" is the latest issue brief in The Century Foundation's (TCF) Security and Opportunity Agenda series. In this brief, TCF's Vice President for Programs Greg Anrig summarizes the evidence that family incomes have become more volatile and that household finances have changed in ways that leave a large segment of the population more vulnerable than in the past. He then describes how a new wage insurance system could be designed to help prevent far more families of laid-off workers from experiencing a punishing loss of income while providing a strong incentive for them to find and accept a new job.

<p>Two specific plans are reviewed in the brief. One proposal for fixing the unemployment insurance system would (1) apply uniform eligibility rules and compensation levels nationwide while retaining the state's role in administering the program; (2) change the financing of the program so that a lower rate would be applied to all payroll tax income, as with Medicare; and (3) overhaul eligibility rules to reduce the huge gaps in existing coverage. The second proposal would institute a new wage insurance plan that would lessen the decline in compensation that many workers experience when they take a new job after becoming unemployed. This plan would replace some lost wages if an individual takes a new job at a lower salary. The wage insurance would be financed through the unemployment tax.

<p>Facts about economic insecurity highlighted in the brief include:
<blockquote>
<p>-- Beginning in the 1980s, Americans began to experience wider average changes in their incomes from year to year. That trend accelerated in the 1990s.

<p>-- While income fluctuations have become widest for workers with below-average earnings, the shift toward much greater volatility applies across the entire spectrum.

<p>-- At its peak in the mid 1990s, earnings instability was almost five times as great as it was in the early 1970s. It dropped somewhat in the late 1990s, but remains far higher than its earlier levels.

<p>-- Over the past two decades, household savings rates have steeply declined so that they are now negative.

<p>-- Over the same period, household debt has soared, most recently reaching its all-time peak of 118 percent of household income.

<p>-- Health insurance and pension are closely linked to employment and many workers do not have alternative access to these important benefits, which makes job loss an expensive and damaging event.

<p>-- In 1947, about 80 percent of workers in jobs covered by unemployment insurance received benefits when they lost their jobs; by 2001, only 43 percent of unemployed workers received benefits.

<p>-- Among the states, coverage levels vary widely, ranging from 21 percent in South Dakota and Louisiana to 74 percent in Connecticut and Massachusetts.

<p>-- The giant gaps and inadequacies of unemployment insurance are an outgrowth of the major changes in the economy since the program was created: more outsourcing and part-time work, more working women, more worker mobility, and lower levels of labor unionization.
</blockquote>
<p>The Security and Opportunity Agenda is an initiative that consists of a series of short, engaging publications putting forward policy ideas for addressing the most serious challenges facing the United States. Each brief provides an overview of the nature of the problem to be confronted, a summary of public opinion data about the issue, an explanation of the proposed solutions and evidence that they will work, and an estimate of the costs involved. The series is intended to offer journalists, congressional staffers, and others concerned with current policy debates a concise guide to the problem issue and a clearly stated idea for a solution. Other briefs in series will include:
<blockquote>
<p>-- Helping Children Move from Bad Schools to Good Ones

<p>-- Improving Voter Participation

<p>-- Getting More Bang for Each Health Care Dollar

<p>-- Making the Tax System Fair and Simple

<p>-- Fixing the Federal Budget

<p>-- Extending Preschool to Everyone

<p>-- Restoring America's International Credibility

<p>-- Preventing the Spread of Weapons of Mass Destruction

<p>-- Renewing the Middle East Peace Process

<p>-- Reducing America's Oil Dependence
