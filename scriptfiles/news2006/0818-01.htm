<p>WASHINGTON - August 18 - Today, the chair of  Wal-Mart's front group, Ambassador Andy Young, was forced to  resign because of racist statements he made about Jews, Asians  and Arabs in defense of Wal-Mart.  In response, WakeUpWalMart.com  issued the following statement by Paul Blank, campaign director:</p>
<p>   Ambassador Andy Young's statements about Jewish-Americans,  Arab-Americans, and Korean-Americans are outrageous and  incredibly hurtful to countless Americans.  As a former civil  rights leader and public spokesperson for Wal-Mart, it is even  more shocking that he would use this hateful demagoguery to  defend Wal-Mart's business practices which put so many small "Mom  and Pop" businesses out of business.</p>
<p>   While Ambassador Young has now resigned as chair of Working  Families for Wal-Mart, a front group established and directly  financed by Wal-Mart, these hateful statements only serve to  raise more serious questions about the recent attacks this same  group has volleyed against some of America's great leaders.</p>
<p>   In just the last week, Wal-Mart has needlessly used an army of  right wing operatives, under the name Working Families for Wal- Mart, to attack countless Democratic leaders who have stood up  and called on Wal-Mart to become a responsible and moral company.</p>
<p>   We hope in the aftermath of Ambassador Andy Young's  resignation, Wal-Mart will immediately shut down this pointless  attack group, end its association with the cadre of right-wing  operatives it currently employs, cast aside its misguided  political threats against so many Democratic leaders, and realize  that only through real positive change will Wal-Mart become a  better company.</p>
