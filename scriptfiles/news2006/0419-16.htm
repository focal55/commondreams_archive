<p>WASHINGTON - April 19 - Today the Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Center for Human Rights announced the Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Poverty Tour: A Journey for Economic and Social Justice. Through the Poverty Tour, the RFK Center hopes to uncover the economic exploitation and social injustices faced by the “invisible” poor across the country. The Poverty Tour will make its first stop in the farmworker community of Immokalee, Florida on April 23rd and 24th. 

<p>Forty years ago Robert Kennedy first witnessed the hardships faced by the impoverished farmworkers of Delano, California as part of the U.S. Senate Subcommittee on Migratory Labor. This marked the first stop of his now famous “poverty tour”, which included stops in the Mississippi Delta and Appalachia, that helped to shape many American’s views on poverty. 

<p>On the Poverty Tour’s first stop, Ethel Kennedy, AFL-CIO President John Sweeney, original members of RFK’s tours, social activists and faith leaders will be touring Immokalee, Florida, home to not only one of our nation’s largest migrant farmworker communities but also home to numerous cases of modern day slavery. Thanks largely to investigations by the southwest Florida-based farmworker organization the Coalition of Immokalee Workers (CIW) <a href="http://www.ciw-online.org/">http://www.ciw-online.org/</a>, the FBI and Justice Department have prosecuted six slavery cases in Florida’s produce fields in recent years freeing over 1,000 workers held against their will.

<p>Pay and conditions have not improved for farmworkers in the forty years since Robert Kennedy first traveled to Delano. A farm worker picking tomatoes in Immokalee earns only 40-45 cents for every 32 pound bucket they pick, a rate that has remained stagnant for almost 30 years –a 65% real wage decrease due to inflation. In order to bring home $50 a worker must pick nearly two tons of tomatoes. The average farm workers’ income, $7500, is well below the federal poverty line. Workers receive no overtime pay, health insurance, sick leave or other benefits. Current labor laws also deny farmworkers the protected right to organize. 

<p>The CIW and the Alliance for Fair Food (AFF), an network of human rights, faith student and labor groups, are engaged in a public education campaign against fast food giant and major produce consumer McDonald’s and its partner brand, Chipotle. The CIW and AFF are calling on McDonald’s and Chipotle to work with the Florida farmworkers to improve wages and partner with the farmworkers in the protection of their own rights in the company’s supply chain. Currently, McDonald's has devolved responsibility for human rights violations against farmworkers, including poverty wages, violence, and forced labor, to the very agricultural employers and labor contractors who have perpetrated these abuses.

A second trip is planned for late May to New Orleans to meet with the victims of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. The journey will meet with members of the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now (ACORN), and look into the devastating governmental failures following the hurricanes and the continuing challenges faced by New Orleans’ low income communities. ACORN is advocating to give those displaced by the hurricanes the right to participate in decisions related to the rebuilding of their communities.
