<p>WASHINGTON - October 23 - For the first time since the U.S. invasion of Iraq, active- duty members of the military are asking Members of Congress to end the U.S. occupation of Iraq and bring American soldiers home.

<p>What: Three active-duty members of the military and their lawyer, a retired U.S. Marine Corps JAG, make comments and take questions from the media.

<p>When: Wednesday, Oct. 25, 11 a.m. EDT
