<p>WASHINGTON - May 25 - Across the United  States, thousands of consumers are responding to the U.S.  Department of Agriculture's (USDA) public comment period on  revisions to the National Organic Program (NOP). A number of the  USDA revisions relate to the &quot;access to pasture&quot; requirement for  organic dairies. The Organic Consumers Association and other  public interest groups are very concerned that the USDA NOP  regulations contain loopholes and imprecise language that could  continue to allow milk produced at giant intensive confinement  dairy feedlots to be labeled as &quot;USDA Organic.&quot; </p>
<p>   So-called organic dairy &quot;industry leaders,&quot; including two of  the largest organic dairy companies in the nation, Horizon  Organic (a subsidiary of Dean Foods and a supplier to Wal-Mart);  and Aurora Organic (a supplier of private brand name organic milk  to Costco, Safeway, Giant, Wild Oats and others), are purchasing  the majority of their milk from feedlot dairies where the cows  have little or no access to pasture, and have routinely been  imported from conventional farms, where the animals have been  weaned on blood plasma, fed genetically engineered feed,  slaughterhouse waste, and poultry manure, and injected or treated  with antibiotics, according to research carried out by the  organic watchdog group, the Cornucopia Institute. Together, these  corporations control up to 65 percent of the organic dairy  market. </p>
<p>   &quot;Many stores, especially big box stores, such as Wal-Mart, are  scrambling to sell more products with the organic label as  consumer demand for these products increases.  Instead of the  stocking more high-quality organic products, these industrial  farms and retail giants are selling the public low-quality  products. We are calling on the USDA to stop allowing these  companies to label these sham products as organic,&quot; says Ronnie  Cummins, executive director of the Organic Consumers Association. </p>
<p>   Tens of thousands of consumers have responded to alerts from  the Organic Consumers Association and have signed on to a  petition demanding that the USDA close loopholes in organic dairy  standards. See full text  at <a href="http://releases.usnewswire.com/redir.asp?ReleaseID=66421&Link=http://www.democracyinaction.org/dia/organizationsORG/oca/campaign.jsp?campaign_KEY=3567">http://www.democracyinaction.org/dia/organizationsORG/oca/campaign.jsp?campaign_KEY=3567</a> </p>
<p>   OCA is encouraging the public to vote with their consumer  dollars in the marketplace, and put pressure on Congress and the  USDA to safeguard organic standards. The USDA is seeking public  comment until June 12, 2006 and already consumer pressure on the  USDA has generated attention from major news organizations such  as The New York Times, San Francisco Chronicle, and National  Public Radio. According to a study by the Consumers Union, 60  percent of consumers say they would NOT pay a premium price for  organic milk if they knew the cows were confined and not given  the opportunity to graze on pasture. </p>
<p>   &quot;Of course industrial agribusiness wants their products  labeled as organic, but they must abide by organic standards.   These intensive confinement dairy feedlots are a clear example of  putting profit above ethics. The USDA has a yearly budget of $90  billion coming from our public taxes, and yet the USDA still  refuses to allocate anything more than crumbs ($10 million  annually) to organics, meanwhile allowing inhumane and non- sustainable industrial farming practices to creep into organic  production. Organic consumers will not  be satisfied until strict  organic standards are implemented, and until Congress allocates  sufficient funds to help family-scale American farmers make the  transition to organic and meet our growing demand for organic  food and other products,&quot; says Cummins.
