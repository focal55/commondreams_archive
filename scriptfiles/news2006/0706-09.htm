<p>SAN DIEGO, California    - July 6 - Progressives from across America will convene at San Diego University July 14-16 for the 3rd Annual DemocracyFest. DemocracyFest is designed to unite progressive-minded people, increase political awareness, and plan for our country's future. Last year's event held in Austin, Texas, drew an attendance of greater than 900 Democrats, Independents and former Republicans.

<p>This year's event looks even more promising with Democratic National Committee chair and former presidential candidate Howard Dean joining Air America talk show hosts/humorists Al Franken and Marc Maron. In keeping with its "Education by Day, Celebration by Night" motto, DemocracyFest offers three days of training for grassroots activists plus a Friday and two Saturday night events packed with star-studded appearances by prominent political leaders and award-winning talent.

<p>On Friday, July 14th, Radio host Al Franken officially opens DemocracyFest with a live broadcast of "The Al Franken Show" coast to coast on Air America Radio from Montezuma Hall at San Diego State University. In the afternoon, the Grassroots Leadership Summit will feature representatives from national and local grassroots organizations including Democracy for America, the Commonweal Institute, Progressive Democrats of America, Service Employees International Union and the San Diego County Democratic Party to share organizing strategies. Friday night's "Celebration By Night" includes Robert Greenwald as he introduces "The Big Buy: Tom DeLay's Stolen Congress," a film co-produced by Jim Schermbeck and Mark Birnbaum.

<p>The event is open and accessible to all individuals who are interested in joining a common cause to restore America to the ideals that made this country great. For more information, visit <a href="http://www.democracyfest.us" target="_new">http://www.democracyfest.us</a>.
