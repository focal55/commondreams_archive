<p>	NEW YORK - June 13 - The Children's Defense  Fund (CDF) releases its report on gun violence against children,  &quot;Protect Children, Not Guns,&quot; at a time when major U.S. cities  are calling for strategies to combat illegal firearms. Citing the  most recent data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and  Prevention, the report reveals that 2,827 children and teens died  as a result of gun violence in 2003 -- more than the number of  American fighting men and women killed in hostile action in Iraq  from 2003 to April 2006. </p>
<p>   &quot;Just as gruesome as incoming casualties from a battlefield,  the bodies of young gunshot victims stream into urban hospital  trauma centers on the frontlines of an undeclared war on  America's children,&quot; said Marian Wright Edelman, president of the  Children's Defense Fund. The children that die every year from  gunshot wounds come from all racial groups and are all ages. Some  of the children killed by guns are too young to start  kindergarten.</p>
<p>   &quot;The deaths of thousands of children each year is morally  obscene for the world's most powerful nation, which has more  resources to address its social ills than any other nation,&quot; said  Edelman. </p>
<p>   The &quot;Protect Children, Not Guns&quot; report comes as many U.S.  mayors also are recognizing the toll that gun violence is taking  on our country and are seeking solutions.  At a recently convened  mayoral summit that was cosponsored by New York City Mayor  Michael R. Bloomberg and Boston Mayor Thomas M. Menino, 15 mayors  from across the country called for national leadership in the war  on gun violence.  Since the summit in April, an additional 37  mayors have endorsed this urgent message and joined the Mayoral  coalition. </p>
<p>   &quot;These calls for leadership are laudable,&quot; said Edelman, &quot;On  behalf of the tens of thousands of children and teens we have  lost to senseless gun violence, CDF implores our leaders to seize  this opportunity for taking a stand for common sense gun safety,  which our country has tragically been lacking for far too long.   The time for action is now before we lose thousands more children  to senseless gun violence.&quot; </p>
<p>   In addition to child and teen gun deaths exceeding the number  of American military casualties in Iraq, here are some of the  deadly facts detailed in the report about the toll gun violence  is taking on America's children: </p>
<p>   -- In 2003, 56 preschoolers were killed by firearms, compared  to 52 law enforcement officers killed in the line of duty.</p>
<p>   -- More 10- to 19-year-olds die from gunshot wounds than from  any other cause except motor vehicle accidents.</p>
<p>   -- Almost 90 percent of the children and teens killed by  firearms in 2003 were boys.</p>
<p>   -- Boys ages 15 to 19 are nearly nine times as likely as girls  of the same age to be killed by a firearm.</p>
<p>   -- In 2003, there were more than nine times as many suicides  by guns among white children and teens as among black children  and teens.</p>
<p>   -- The firearm death rate for black males ages 15 to 19 is  more than four times that of white males the same age.</p>
<p>   -- The seven states that recorded the most deaths among  children and teens by firearms in 2003 were California, Texas,  Illinois, New York, Pennsylvania, Florida and North Carolina. The  state with the fewest child gun deaths was Hawaii with one.</p>
<p>   -- The rate of firearm deaths among children under age 15 is  far higher in the United States than in 25 other industrialized  countries combined. &quot;We have many more handguns and much weaker  gun laws than any other country,&quot; says Harvard Professor David  Hemenway, who has worked to develop strategies to combat illegal  firearms.</p>
<p>   The Children's Defense Fund calls for the support of common  sense gun safety measures; congressional passage of legislation  that closes the gun show loophole to criminal background checks  on those purchasing guns from unlicensed dealers; and renewal of  the ban on assault weapons. Parents should remove guns from their  homes; organize nonviolent conflict resolution support groups in  their congregations and communities; and refuse to buy video  games and other products for their children that glamorize or  make violence socially acceptable or fun. </p>
<p>   Community leaders should turn schools and places of worship  into venues of quality summer and after-school programs for  children as positive alternatives to the streets.  They should  also adopt proven programs like Ceasefire Initiatives that bring  families, faith groups, social service providers and law  enforcement together to halt the killing of teens by other teens.  &quot;It is imperative that we make our homes, our streets and our  communities safe from firearms now for the sake of our children,&quot;  said Edelman.</p>
