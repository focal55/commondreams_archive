<p>WASHINGTON - May 10 - <p>   -- New Addition to Eyes Wide Open Exhibit Highlights Those  Currently in Harm's Way Who Will Perish if Iraq War Continues</p>
<p>   -- Military Families travel to D.C.; tell Congress &quot;No More  Deaths in an Unnecessary War!&quot;</p>
<p>   Military Families will travel from across the country to  Washington, D.C. and help unveil a new section of the American  Friends Service Committee's Eyes Wide Open: The Human Cost of War  exhibit highlighting lives that will be lost if Congress does not  take action to end the war in Iraq. Eyes Wide Open has been a  memorial to the fallen, with combat boots and shoes representing  U.S. troops and Iraqis who have lost their lives in this war. The  new prospective boots display will focus attention on those who  are currently in harm's way, who will fall if the war in Iraq  continues.</p>
<p>   Since March, 2003, on average, over two service men and women  have died each day as a result of the war in Iraq; that fatality  rate continues in May, 2006. Discussions in Congress about the  war in Iraq and exit strategies include many proposals for  bringing troops home after the mid-term election in November,  2006. If Congress waits until November to act, it is likely that  350 or more U.S. servicemen and women will die along with  countless Iraqi children, women and men.</p>
<p>   &quot;This is a poignant and painful addition to the Eyes Wide Open  exhibit, but one that all decision-makers should see,&quot; stated  Larry Syverson of Richmond, Virginia, whose son in the Army is  currently serving a second tour of duty in the Persian Gulf. &quot;I  hope every member of Congress and Senator visits this exhibit and  reflects on the urgency of ending this war. Their failure to act  could mean that the next pair of boots that is moved from this  section to the section devoted to the boots of the fallen could  be my son's.&quot;</p>
<p>   &quot;The Eyes Wide Open exhibit on the National Mall May 11-14  will pay tribute to those who have fallen,&quot; commented Anne  Roesler of Saratoga, California, whose son in the 82nd Airborne  Division faces a fourth deployment to Iraq, &quot;and the new  prospective boots display highlights the need for an immediate  end to the war in Iraq so that no more lives are lost in a war  that should never have been.&quot;</p>
<p>   WHAT: Prospective boots display added to EYES WIDE OPEN: THE  HUMAN COST OF WAR, the American Friends Service Committees'  widely acclaimed memorial exhibit that has traditionally featured  a pair of combat boots for every U.S. military casualty, and  civilian shoes representing a fraction of Iraqi civilian  casualties. The prospective boots display features boots for  service men and women currently serving in Iraq, whose lives WILL  BE lost if the war continues through November, 2006.</p>
<p>   WHEN: Thursday to Sunday, May 11 -14. Families will be  gathering onsite at 10:30 AM on Saturday, May 13.</p>
<p>   WHERE: National Mall, Washington, D.C. (at the gravel path at  13th Street and Jefferson Drive.)</p>
<p>   AVAILABLE FOR INTERVIEW:</p>
