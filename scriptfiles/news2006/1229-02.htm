<p>WASHINGTON - December 29 - The
time is right for a serious push to reform the system of congressional
redistricting in Texas, according to the Texas Public Interest Research
Group (TexPIRG).

<p>&ldquo;In
a real democracy, the voters choose their representatives, not the
other way around,&rdquo; said Jeff Brooks, Advocate for TexPIRG. &ldquo;The
citizens of Texas deserve a system of congressional redistricting that
expresses the democratically-expressed will of the people, rather than
a system that only serves partisan political goals.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Partisan
redistricting, also known as &ldquo;gerrymandering,&rdquo; takes place when the
majority party in the legislature redraws the congressional district
maps so as to maximize the advantage to their own party. By carefully
studying data from past elections, the majority party arranges the map
so that supporters of the minority party fall into as few districts as
possible, while their own supporters are given as many districts as
possible. Consequently, the majority party gains a far greater share of
congressional representation than their share of the congressional vote.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This
problem has been around for a long time,&rdquo; Brooks said. &ldquo;The Republicans
and Democrats have both done it. It&rsquo;s high time for both parties to
look to the interests of the people of Texas, rather than their own
partisan advantage.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>According
to Brooks, the 80th Legislature has a unique opportunity to address the
redistricting issue. The anger from the 2003 redistricting battle has
largely faded and enough time remains until the next round of
redistricting in 2011 for legislators to look at all options. Steadily
changing demographics are causing members of both parties to consider
the future political landscape of the state. Furthermore, with several
new members and the possibility of a shakeup in the legislative
leadership, the legislature will be able to look at the issue with a
fresh perspective.</p>
  <p>According
to TexPIRG, because partisan redistricting creates districts that
overwhelmingly favor a specific party, few of the congressional
districts in Texas are genuinely competitive. Most congressional
elections have, to all intents and purposes, been decided ahead of
time, before the first citizen walks into a voting booth. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re
unlucky enough to be a Republican in a Democratic district or a
Democrat in a Republican district, your right to vote has effectively
been taken away,&rdquo; Brooks said.</p>

  <p>Furthermore,
gerrymandering results in communities being unfairly split into several
congressional districts, rather than having a district of their own.
For example, Austin is a heavily Democratic community, but two of
Austin&rsquo;s three congressional representatives are Republicans. Partisan
redistricting also dilutes the political power of rural areas vis-&agrave;-vis
urban areas, negatively affecting rural influence over such critical
issues as water rights. The democratically-expressed wishes of citizens
are pushed aside in the pursuit of partisan advantage.</p>
  <p>The
Supreme Court has recently ruled that a legislature can draw new
congressional districts whenever it wants, rather than the
traditionally-accepted time frame of once per decade. This raises the
disturbing prospect of a bitter round of redistricting every time the
state legislative changes hands. In short, under our current system, we
face the very real possibility of complete legislative paralysis.</p>
  <p>According
to TexPIRG, the best solution to this problem is the creation of an
independent bi-partisan committee of citizens, with strict
conflict-of-interest provisions, to oversee the redistricting process
every ten years. Specific criteria for redistricting plans should also
be included in any legislation, including prohibitions against plans
that specifically favor or discriminate against any political party or
other group. Many other states, ranging from Idaho to New Jersey have
enacted such legislation and have found the results to be very
successful.</p>
  <p>In
previous legislative sessions, State Senator Jeff Wentworth (R-San
Antonio) has introduced legislation which meets several of these goals.
His bill passed the Senate in the last session but died in committee in
the House. Wentworth has stated that he will again file his bill in the
80th Legislative Session. Representative Mark Strama (D-Austin) has
already pre-filed similar legislation in the House and Representative
Allan Ritter (D-Nederland) has proposed legislation which would limit
redistricting to once per decade. TexPIRG strongly supports these
efforts and applauds their bi-partisan nature.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If
we can establish a bi-partisan redistricting committee and set common
sense criteria for redistricting plans, the Texas congressional
delegation will once again be chosen by the people of Texas,&rdquo; Brooks
said. &ldquo;The timing and the changing political landscape give the 80th
Legislature a golden opportunity to reform the redistricting system. I
hope they seize the opportunity with both hands.&rdquo;</p></p>
