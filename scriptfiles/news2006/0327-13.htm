<p> OFF SHORE, Guinea - March 27 -  After witnessing fish being stolen from one of the poorest regions on the world, Greenpeace and the Environmental Justice Foundation, in cooperation with enforcement authorities from Guinea, are from today preparing to arrest pirate-fishing vessels that are laundering their cargo through European ports. 
    </p>

    <div class="body">    
      In a joint operation on board the Greenpeace ship M.Y Esperanza the
environmental and human rights organisations have been operating
undercover documenting nearly 70 vessels in West African waters for the
past ten days.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
Of 67 foreign flagged vessels, from Korea, China, Italy, Liberia and
Belize – 19 (28%) are not authorised to fish, 22 (32%) are known to
have a history of pirate fishing, 9(14%) had hidden names and 8 (12%)
were inside 12 mile limit - waters reserved for local fishermen only.
In the shadowy world of pirate fishing, the illegal catch is then
transferred to refrigerated ships – reefers – many of which sail
straight into the heart of Europe and the port of Las Palmas. <br>
<br>
Two Guinean enforcement officials, with powers of arrest, have now
joined the Esperanza, which will continue to carry out surveillance
operations in the region.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
"Pirate fishing is a global threat to the oceans and those who depend
upon them. We hear fine words from governments about tackling the
problem – but if they were serious then we wouldn’t need to be here and
offer our ship to the Guinea authorities," said Sarah Duthie,
Greenpeace Oceans campaigner on board the Esperanza. "The first thing
that must be done is to close ports to pirate fishing boats, deny them
access to markets and ensure that companies are prosecuted.”<br>
&nbsp;<br>
West Africa is the only region in the world where fish consumption is
falling. Local fishermen are losing much needed income and sometimes
even their lives as they struggle to compete with the foreign trawlers
illegally coming into their waters. The Guinean authorities have
virtually no capacity to combat the fish pirates, who sometimes come
within a couple of miles from the shore.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
"It is complete hypocrisy for governments to talk about encouraging aid
to Africa at the same time as allowing the food and income they need to
be stolen from their waters and sold in the markets of Europe," said
Helene Bours, of the Environmental Justice Foundation. "It is a pattern
that is repeated globally and is the responsibility of all nations to
act to make piracy history.”<br>
<br>
Internationally, pirate fishing is worth between US$4 billion and US$9
billion a year - 20% of the total fish catch.&nbsp; Pirate fishing
takes place every day, in every ocean. It is estimated that just in
sub-Saharan Africa it nets US$1 billion dollars annually, while in the
waters of the Southern Ocean, up to 50% of the valuable Patagonian
toothfish may come from illegal activities. In the Baltic Sea, 40% of
the cod caught in 2002/2003 was estimated to have been illegal.
<br>
<br>
<div class="Section"> <b>Notes to Editor
</b>
<p class="notes-to-editor">(1). Pirate fishing is Illegal, Unregulated and Unreported (IUU) fishing.<br />
(2). Greenpeace and the Environmental Justice Foundation are working together to expose the pirate fishing fleets that operate without sanction across the globe. Together the international environment and human rights organisations are demanding that governments close ports to ban pirates, deny them access to markets and prosecute companies supporting them.<br />
(3). The drive to make piracy history is the second leg of a 14-month global expedition "Defending Our Oceans", the most ambitious ship expedition ever undertaken by Greenpeace to expose the threats to the oceans and demand a global network of properly enforced marine reserves covering 40% of the worlds oceans. Greenpeace aims to gather a million Ocean Defenders by the end of the expedition in February 2007.</p>
