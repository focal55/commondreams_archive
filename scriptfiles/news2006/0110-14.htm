<p>WASHINGTON - January 10 - With the Senate  Judiciary Committee hearings for Supreme Court nominee Samuel A.  Alito Jr. officially underway, Media Matters for America has  compiled the top myths and falsehoods advanced by conservatives  and Alito supporters -- and often repeated in the mainstream  media -- that effectively obscure his record and distort concerns  and questions raised by his critics.</p>
<p>   <b>1) Alito's opinion in Farmer case is evidence that he would  vote to uphold Roe</b></p>
<p>   Broadcast and print media have repeatedly mischaracterized  Alito's concurring opinion in the 2000 case Planned Parenthood of  Central New Jersey vs. Farmer as evidence that he has issued  conflicting rulings on abortion. Specifically, these news outlets  have juxtaposed Alito's decision in the Farmer case, in which he  voted with the majority on the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals  to strike down a New Jersey law restricting certain late-term  abortion procedures, with Alito's dissent in a 1991 case, Planned  Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania vs. Casey, in which he  argued for upholding restrictions on abortion. But Alito's  actions in the two cases are in no way inconsistent. His  concurring opinion in Farmer provides no support for the claim  that he would have ruled the same way if he were sitting on the  Supreme Court. Indeed, he explicitly noted in a separate  concurring opinion that he was voting to strike down the abortion  ban only because he was obligated as an appellate judge to follow  Supreme Court precedent. </p>
<p>   In that concurrence, Alito wrote that he was voting to strike  down the abortion ban only because he was bound to follow the  Supreme Court's 2000 decision in Stenberg vs. Carhart. In that  case, the court struck down a Nebraska law restricting certain  late-term abortion procedures as an undue burden, in part because  the ban did not include an exception for the health of the  pregnant woman. While the majority opinion in Farmer provided a  detailed examination of the New Jersey law's constitutionality,  Alito explicitly distanced himself from such analysis. In his  concurring opinion, he wrote: &quot;Our responsibility as a lower  court is to follow and apply controlling Supreme Court  precedent.&quot; He went on to express the view that the court's only  responsibility was to &quot;explain why Carhart requires us to affirm  the decision of the District Court.&quot; (The District Court  overturned the New Jersey late-term abortion ban.)</p>
<p>   As correspondent Jeffrey Toobin stated on the October 31  edition of CNN's American Morning, the Farmer opinion represented  &quot;a reluctant following of precedent&quot; by Alito. Toobin also  correctly noted that Alito would have &quot;a lot more flexibility  regarding precedent&quot; as a Supreme Court justice.</p>
<p>   <b>2) Alito's recusal pledge covered only a limited time frame</b></p>
<p>   In reporting on Alito's refusal to recuse himself in two cases  involving companies in which he owned stock, The New York Times  has repeated without challenge Alito's claim that the pledge he  made in 1990 to recuse himself in such cases was limited to &quot;the  initial period&quot; after his confirmation. In fact, when Alito  assured the Senate Judiciary Committee that he would recuse  himself from cases involving companies in which he had a  financial interest, he did not qualify the pledge in any way or  suggest that it was time-limited.</p>
<p>   In the questionnaire he submitted to the Senate during his  1990 confirmation, Alito made the unqualified promise to recuse  himself from all cases involving companies tied to his &quot;financial  interests,&quot; such as Vanguard Group and Smith Barney: </p>
<p>   I do not believe that conflicts of interest relating to my  financial interests are likely to arise. I would, however,  disqualify myself from any cases involving the Vanguard  companies, the brokerage firm of Smith Barney, or the First  Federal Savings &amp; Loan of Rochester, New York. </p>
<p>   Despite this pledge, Alito participated in a 2002 case  involving the Vanguard Group in which Shantee Maharaj, widow of a  holder of Vanguard funds, charged, according to a November 1,  2005, Washington Post article, &quot;that the company had improperly  seized some private accounts and blocked the owner's widow from  obtaining the funds they contained.&quot; Alito joined in a ruling in  favor of Vanguard, but the decision was withdrawn after Maharaj  complained that Alito's participation in the case was improper.  Further, Alito ruled on a 1996 case involving Smith Barney.</p>
<p>   The Times has also presented as undisputed the claim that  Alito was not required to recuse himself in those cases. In fact,  the propriety of Alito's participation in those cases is very  much in dispute. George Washington University constitutional law  professor Mary Cheh has said that &quot;even though these are broadly  held funds ... if you are aware of the holdings, you should  recuse yourself because you stand to benefit one way or the  other.&quot; Others such as University of Pennsylvania law school  professor Geoffrey C. Hazard Jr. argue that Alito had no  obligation to recuse himself from these cases. But even Hazard  has conceded that Alito's 1990 pledge to recuse himself is &quot;a  basis for mild criticism,&quot; given that Alito has since engaged in  conduct that is apparently at odds with it.</p>
<p>   <b>3) Alito is a &quot;strict constructionist&quot;</b></p>
<p>   Shortly after Alito's nomination, NBC Today co-host Katie  Couric parroted his supporters' claim that he is a &quot;strict  constructionist.&quot; Such characterizations of Alito's judicial  temperament promote the false dichotomy -- advanced by  conservatives in support of Bush's judicial nominees -- between  strict constructionists (who, supporters claim, will &quot;interpret  the Constitution literally&quot;) and &quot;judicial activists&quot; (whom  supporters describe as &quot;legislating from the bench&quot;). Couric's  comments also suggest that Alito's judicial philosophy is not a  matter of dispute. But whether Alito is a true &quot;strict  constructionist&quot; -- if scholars can even agree on a definition --  and a practitioner of judicial restraint is an issue very much in  dispute. Indeed, some legal experts contend that by one measure  of &quot;activism&quot;-- a judge's inclination to strike down statutes  passed by Congress -- Alito's record is, in fact, that of a  judicial activist.</p>
<p>   A recent study by Yale law professor Paul Gewirtz and Yale Law  School graduate Chad Golder suggests that Supreme Court justices  often labeled &quot;strict constructionists&quot; (i.e., justices who  purport to discern and apply the true original meaning of  constitutional provisions) are the real judicial activists.  Gewirtz and Golder ranked the justices according to how often  each voted to strike down a law passed by Congress. They found  that justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, often  considered the two most conservative justices on the high court,  ranked first and third, respectively, in frequency of votes  striking down acts of Congress. While their analysis concerned  only Supreme Court justices, George Washington University law  professor and New Republic legal affairs editor Jeffrey Rosen  recently analyzed Alito's efforts to restrict congressional  authority and similarly determined that Alito is an &quot;activist.&quot;</p>
<p>   In a November 22, 2004, New Republic column, Rosen defined  &quot;conservative activists&quot; as those &quot;determined to use the courts  to strike at the heart of the regulatory state&quot;; Rosen included  Alito in that group. As evidence, he cited Alito's &quot;troubling&quot;  view on the limited scope of congressional authority under the  Commerce Clause as described in his &quot;dissent from a decision  upholding the constitutionality of a federal law prohibiting the  possession of machine guns.&quot; Rosen concluded that Alito's &quot;lack  of deference to Congress is unsettling.&quot;</p>
<p>   Alito's colleagues on the bench have similarly criticized his  apparent willingness to usurp congressional authority. For  example, the majority opinion of the 3rd Circuit Court in the  case United States vs. Rybar also criticized Alito's dissenting  view that Congress ought to be required to prove a link between  regulation and interstate commerce in such cases. Third Circuit  Chief Justice Dolores K. Sloviter wrote: &quot;We know of no authority  to support such a demand on Congress&quot;; further, she noted that  such a demand would require &quot;Congress or the Executive to play  Show and Tell with the federal courts at the peril of  invalidation of a Congressional statute.&quot;</p>
<p>   <b>4) Alito's 1985 criticism of Roe mirrors legal scholars'  opinion that the decision was right but incorrectly reasoned</b></p>
<p>   In his 1985 application for the position of assistant attorney  general in the Reagan Justice Department, Alito wrote that he was  &quot;proud of his contributions in cases in which the government has  argued in the Supreme Court ... that the Constitution does not  protect a right to an abortion.&quot; Numerous conservative  commentators have attempted to downplay Alito's stated position  on abortion by likening it to the common argument put forth by  some more liberal legal experts that the decision in Roe vs. Wade  was correct, but the court's reasoning was wrong. In fact, there  is a clear difference between arguing that a constitutional right  to an abortion does not exist and questioning the particular  constitutional principles upon which the court relied in reaching  its decision. </p>
<p>   Those likening these arguments have often put forth as  examples the criticism of Roe articulated by Supreme Court  Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Some also cite comments made by  author and former Supreme Court clerk Edward Lazarus. But in  contrast to Alito, both Ginsburg and Lazarus have clearly stated  in their writings on the subject that they believe the  Constitution protects a woman's right to an abortion.</p>
<p>   Indeed, in a 1984 lecture, Ginsburg strongly criticized the  basis for the court's affirmation of a constitutional right to an  abortion. She argued that, while the Supreme Court was right to  strike down the Texas law in question, it should have done so on  the basis of the Constitution's equal protection clause, rather  than on an unstated constitutional right to privacy. But Ginsburg  affirmed her belief in a constitutional right to abortion during  her 1993 confirmation hearings.</p>
<p>   In an October 2002 column, Lazarus asserted that &quot;(a)s a  matter of constitutional interpretation and judicial method, Roe  borders on the indefensible.&quot; But he went on to write, &quot;I say  this as someone utterly committed to the right to choose, as  someone who believes such a right has grounding elsewhere in the  Constitution instead of where Roe placed it.&quot;</p>
<p>   <b>5) Alito's 1985 job application does not represent his &quot;personal views&quot;</b></p>
<p>   Some media figures have further defended Alito's controversial  1985 job application by claiming that he was not expressing his  &quot;personal views&quot; when he wrote that &quot;the Constitution does not  protect a right to an abortion.&quot; For example, on the November 14,  2005, edition of Fox News' Special Report, host Brit Hume  asserted that &quot;these were not personal views he was discussing,&quot;  but rather &quot;the legal arguments that he made as a lawyer in the  Reagan Justice Department.&quot;</p>
<p>   In fact, Alito made clear in the application that he  &quot;strongly&quot; and &quot;personally&quot; believed in the legal arguments in  question: </p>
<p>   Most recently, it has been an honor and a source of personal  satisfaction for me to serve in the office of the Solicitor  General during President Reagan's administration and to help to  advance legal positions in which I personally believe very  strongly. I am particularly proud of my contributions in recent  cases in which the government has argued in the Supreme Court  that racial and ethnic quotas should not be allowed and that the  Constitution does not protect the right to an abortion. </p>
<p>   <b>6) The &quot;Ginsburg precedent&quot; should apply to the Democrats'  handling of Alito</b></p>
<p>   As occurred following the 2005 nomination of Chief Justice  John G. Roberts Jr., reporters and conservative commentators have  suggested that Senate Democrats should set aside ideological  concerns in considering the Alito nomination because Senate  Republicans did just that in their nearly unanimous 1993  confirmation of Ginsburg. This deceptive argument -- the so- called &quot;Ginsburg precedent&quot; -- was recently revived by NBC host  Tim Russert and The 700 Club host Pat Robertson. The argument  rests, however, on the false claim that Republicans confirmed  Ginsburg despite her reputation as a liberal. In fact, she had  established a largely moderate record during her 13 years on the  U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit and was recommended to  President Clinton by a senior Republican on the Senate Judiciary  Committee.</p>
<p>   Indeed, Ginsburg was considered &quot;a consensus choice, pushed by  Republicans and accepted by the president in large part because  he didn't want to take on a big fight,&quot; as Ruth Marcus wrote in  her November 15, 2005, Washington Post column. Sen. Orrin Hatch  (R-UT) -- then the ranking Republican member of the Senate  Judiciary Committee -- claimed credit in his autobiography,  Square Peg: Confessions of a Citizen Senator (Basic Books, 2002),  for suggesting Ginsburg as a Supreme Court nominee in 1993 after  discouraging Clinton from nominating then-Secretary of the  Interior Bruce Babbitt. Hatch even wrote of Ginsburg: &quot;Not many  people realize this, but her voting record at the appellate court  was very similar to that of another subsequent Supreme Court  Justice, Antonin Scalia&quot; (Page 263). This assessment of  Ginsburg's reputation as a moderate judge was substantiated by a  study of the 1987 appeals court that found Ginsburg had voted  more consistently with Republican-appointed judges -- such as  Kenneth W. Starr and Laurence H. Silberman -- than those  appointed by Democrats.</p>
