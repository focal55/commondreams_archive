<p>WASHINGTON - August 8 - <p><b>WHAT:</b> A Candlelight Vigil near President Bush's Ranch in Crawford, 
Texas, featuring Religious Leaders and Local Activists

<p><b>WHEN: </b>Thursday, August 10, 2006 - 9:00pm

<p><b>WHERE: </b>Crawford Peace House (9142 E. Fifth St., Crawford, TX 76638)

<p>Co-sponsored by American Jewish World Service and the General Board of 
Church and Society of the United Methodist Church.

<p>During the President's annual vacation in Crawford, TX, interfaith 
activists will gather at the Crawford Peace House in a candlelight vigil 
to call attention to the increasing violence in Darfur and the need for 
new U.S. action on this crisis. This event will boost the pressure on 
the Bush Administration to use its influence to break the continuing 
deadlock on Darfur and achieve a United Nations peacekeeping mission 
that can protect civilians and humanitarian operations.

<p>Africa Action's statement on "How the U.S. Can Break the Deadlock on 
Darfur" is available here: 
<a href="http://www.africaaction.org/newsroom/docs/LeverageonDarfur.pdf">http://www.africaaction.org/newsroom/docs/LeverageonDarfur.pdf</a><p>The diverse community of activists represented at this event will 
underscore the fact that this genocide continues without a break and 
cannot be ignored. The U.S. must mobilize support in the United Nations 
Security Council for a new resolution to deploy UN peacekeepers to 
Darfur, and it must challenge the Sudanese government's opposition to a 
UN mission. As the only nation to have identified the bloodshed in 
Darfur as genocide, the United States has both the responsibility and 
the power to protect the people of Darfur, and it must act now to stop 
this ongoing genocide.

<p>The event in Crawford on August 10th comes just weeks ahead of a major 
Africa Action mobilization outside the White House in Washington, DC on 
September 9th, to mark the second anniversary of the Bush 
Administration's acknowledgement that what is happening in Darfur 
constitutes genocide.
