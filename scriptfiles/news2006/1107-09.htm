<p>WASHINGTON - November 7 - U.S. Marine Corps Lance Corporal Ivan
Brobeck, 20, of Arlington, Virginia, will return to
the United States on election day to ask President
Bush and Congress to bring the troops home now. 
During a tour of duty in Iraq in 2004 Brobeck
witnessed regular instances of abuse of Iraqi
detainees and the killing of Iraqi civilians at
military checkpoints.  He chose Canada over a second
tour in a war that he came to see as illegal and
contrary to the interests and moral standards of most Americans.

<p>"I was not willing to go back and fight a war that I
did not believe was right, and I didn't want to put
myself in a situation where I would possibly kill an
innocent civilian," Brobeck explains.  "Please,
President Bush, do what is right; do everything you
can to bring our troops home from Iraq."

<p>Ivan Brobeck intends to surrender to military
authorities in Washington, DC on election day. He
expects to face a military court martial for his
absence.  He is returning in the same spirit that
motivated him to enlist at age 17 - a desire to serve
his country and to stand for what is right.
