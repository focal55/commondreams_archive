<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON - February 2 - When a man walks into a 
bar, asks if it&#8217;s a gay bar and starts shooting, there 
couldn&#8217;t be any more glaringly obvious and enraging&#160;example 
that we need uniform hate crimes law and that Congress is stubbornly 
failing to act,&#8217; said Human Rights Campaign President Joe 
Solmonese.</b>&#160;</font></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Human Rights Campaign President Joe Solmonese made the 
following statement in the wake of a violent anti-gay hate crime 
in&#160;Massachusetts Wednesday 
evening.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#8220;When a man walks 
into a bar, asks if it&#8217;s a gay bar and starts shooting, there 
couldn&#8217;t be any more glaringly obvious and enraging example that 
we need uniform hate crimes law and that Congress has stubbornly failed 
to act,&#8221; said Solmonese. &#8220;The Senate can change this today. 
Whether the hate crime occurs in New Bedford, Massachusetts, or Roanoke, 
Virginia, local law enforcement deserve access to the 
same tools. The Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act would do 
this.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#8220;I am infuriated and 
deeply saddened. Our hearts are with the families and friends of those 
wounded in this tragic hate crime,&#8221; added Solmonese. &#8220;This 
harrowing crime is a sobering and shocking reminder of the way anti-gay 
prejudice manifests to violence and that we need to deal with this as a 
country.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#8220;We are thankful that the 
local authorities are investigating this as a hate crime. We stand by 
congressional allies who have been working for years to pass a measure 
giving critical tools to police officers and district attorneys working 
for justice in the wake of horrifying hate crimes. The Senate should do 
what the House has already done and pass the hate crimes 
law.&#8221;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">According to reports a 
man walked into a lounge in New Bedford, 
Mass., asking if it was a gay bar. He then brandished a 
hatchet, swinging it at victims, and later drew a gun, opening fire and 
wounding several people.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the course of 
prosecuting the killers in the anti-gay hate crime in Laramie, 
Wyo., in which Matthew Shepard was murdered, local law 
enforcement was forced to furlough several officers due to scarcity of 
resources. The Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act, already passed by 
the House in the fall and by the Senate in years past, would give grants 
to local law enforcement to fully prosecute these crimes. Senate 
leadership is stalling a vote on the bill.</font></p>
