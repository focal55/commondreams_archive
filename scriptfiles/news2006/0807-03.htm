<p>WASHINGTON - August 7 - In response to the  escalating violence and continued deaths of civilians in the  conflict between Hizbollah and Israel, Amnesty International is  holding vigils across the United States and around the world  today to stand in solidarity with the victims and survivors in  Lebanon and Israel. The organization is calling for an immediate,  full and effective ceasefire and demanding that all governments  stop the supply of arms.</p>
<p>   &quot;The parties to this conflict continue to engage in  indiscriminate attacks on civilians,&quot; said Larry Cox, AIUSA  Executive Director.  &quot;Israel and Hizbollah must agree to stop the  violence and killing of innocent civilians.  Thousands of people  are participating in small and large events, from Venezuela to  Australia, from the United Kingdom to Korea, from Turkey to the  United States and everywhere in between, calling for a ceasefire  now.&quot;</p>
<p>   There are more than 50 vigils being held in towns and cities  around the United States including New York City, Cookeville, TN,  Durango, CO, Peoria, IL, Pullman, AR, and Las Vegas (see NOTE  below).  In addition, the national vigil is in front of the U.S.  State Department from 4:30 to 6:30 p.m. in Washington, DC.</p>
<p>   &quot;Amnesty International members around the world are showing  their solidarity with the victims and survivors and sending  signed petitions to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice to  redouble U.S. efforts to broker an immediate, full and effective  ceasefire,&quot; said Alexandra Arriaga, Amnesty International USA's  Director of Government Relations.</p>
<p>   There will be short statement read at every vigil in the  United States and around the world which follows below:</p>
<p>   &quot;In past weeks we have seen the catastrophic events of the  conflict between Israel and Lebanon unfold and magnify into a  devastating series of violent atrocities and war crimes. We hear  of the hundreds of lives lost, the homes destroyed, the many  thousands made homeless, families torn apart and livelihoods  crushed. This evening, Amnesty International members around the  world, our supporters, our friends and our fellow partner  organizations all stand together in solidarity with those who  have suffered in this conflict. We mourn deeply for the victims  and our hearts reach out to their families to wish them strength  in this time of chaos. Our thoughts also stay closely with those  surviving the conflict in the face of extreme danger, to whom we  wish courage and immediate safety. We call on Israel and  Hizbollah to respect the lives and the human rights of innocent  people. And we implore other governments around the world to  intervene to help the people of Israel and Lebanon - and to join  our call for an end to this senseless violence. Today we stand  together with a simple message: For all our sakes, ceasefire.&quot;</p>
