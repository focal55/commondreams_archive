WASHINGTON - February 28 - The American Civil Liberties Union today urged the Supreme Court to heed more than 
30 years of precedent and reject a Vermont measure that would allow the state to 
impose expenditure limits on political campaigns. <BR>
&nbsp;<BR>"It is not the 
government's role to tell candidates how much they can speak and to tell voters 
how much information they need to receive during an election campaign," said 
Mitchell L. Pearl, an ACLU of Vermont cooperating attorney who is direct counsel 
in the case along with the national ACLU. <BR>&nbsp;<BR>At issue in <EM>Randall v. 
Sorrell</EM>, 04-1528, is whether Vermont's Act 64 violates free speech under the 
First Amendment, as well the Court's own precedent against campaign spending 
limits. The Act imposes severe limits on the amount of money that candidates can 
spend to promote their own elections, coupled with the lowest statewide 
contribution limits in the country.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>Pearl noted that Vermont is a 
small state where constituents tend to know their elected officials 
personally.&nbsp; "Election corruption isn't a significant problem in Vermont," 
he said, adding that Vermont ranked 49th in spending in gubernatorial elections 
across the country.&nbsp; "Act 64 is causing more harm than good to the 
candidates and people of Vermont."<BR>&nbsp;<BR>Under Act 64, spending in a 
gubernatorial race would be limited to $300,000 per candidate and to $2,000 for 
a State House seat and individuals may only contribute between $200 and $400 to 
candidates in a two-year election cycle, depending on the office being 
sought.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>In briefs filed with the Court, the ACLU argued that the 
extreme limits of Act 64 prevent voters from hearing from the candidates 
themselves, and ultimately magnifies the importance of so-called special 
interest spending, further undermining the state's asserted interest in limiting 
the influence of such groups on the electoral process. In addition, the Act 
blurs the line between discussions of issues by candidates, particularly 
incumbents, and election speech.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>"The state of Vermont would have 
us believe Act 64 is only about money and not about speech, when in fact the 
opposite is true," said ACLU senior staff attorney Mark Lopez, who is co-counsel 
in today's case.&nbsp; "A candidate who has reached the spending limit cannot 
even drive to the village green to deliver a political speech without violating 
the law, because mileage counts as an expenditure under this law." 
<BR>&nbsp;<BR>Thirty years ago, in the landmark case of <EM>Buckley v. Valeo</EM>, the 
Justices found that a candidate, "no less than any other person, has a First 
Amendment right to engage in the discussion of public issues and vigorously and 
tirelessly advocate his own election and the election of other 
candidates."<BR>&nbsp;<BR>"Indeed," the Court noted in Buckley, "it is of 
particular importance that candidates have the unfettered opportunity to make 
their views known so that the electorate may intelligently evaluate the 
candidates' personal qualities and their positions on vital public issues before 
choosing among them on Election Day."<BR>&nbsp;<BR>Attorneys for the ACLU are 
Peter F. Langrock and Pearl of Langrock, Sperry and Wool, LLP in Middlebury, 
Vermont on behalf of the ACLU of Vermont, and Steven R. Shapiro, Joel Gora and 
Lopez of the national ACLU. <BR>
