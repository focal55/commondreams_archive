<p>ALBANY - September 6 - The American Civil Liberties Union and the New York Civil Liberties 
Union today said a New York state law requiring insurance companies to include 
contraceptive coverage in drug benefit packages promotes women&#8217;s health and is 
an important step toward ending gender discrimination in insurance 
coverage.&nbsp; The organizations voiced support for the law as argument got 
underway today in court. </P>
<P>&#8220;This law strikes a careful balance, promoting women&#8217;s health and ending 
gender discrimination while appropriately protecting religious freedoms,&#8221; said 
Diana Kasdan, a staff attorney with the ACLU Reproductive Freedom Project. 
&#8220;Religiously affiliated organizations that employ and serve people of diverse 
beliefs and provide social services -- for example, medical care -- do not have 
a right to discriminate by refusing to cover basic health services for female 
employees.&#8221;</P>
<P>The law in question, the Women&#8217;s Health and Wellness Act, requires insurance 
companies to cover women&#8217;s preventive health care, including mandating that 
insurance plans that cover prescription drugs do not exclude contraceptives from 
that coverage.&nbsp; The law exempts religious employers, such as churches, 
mosques, and temples, whose main purpose is to promote a particular religious 
faith and who primarily employ and serve people who share their religious 
beliefs. </P>
<P>&#8220;Courts have made it clear that health insurers may not discriminate against 
women,&#8221; said Elisabeth Benjamin, director of the NYCLU&#8217;s Reproductive Rights 
Project. &#8220;Studies show that insured women pay 68 percent more in out-of-pocket 
costs than insured men.&nbsp; The Women's Health and Wellness Act puts women on 
equal footing with men when it comes to health insurance coverage.&#8221;</P>
<P>In January 2006, a lower court found that the law protects women&#8217;s health and 
rights and upheld the law as constitutional.&nbsp; The ACLU and the NYCLU have 
filed friend-of-the-court briefs at every step of the challenge, including in 
the Court of Appeals for the State of New York, which is hearing today&#8217;s 
argument.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>Ten religiously affiliated organizations brought the challenge against the 
Women&#8217;s Health and Wellness Act. The organizations include Catholic Charities of 
Albany and Ogdensburg and other Catholic and Baptist social service 
organizations.</P>
<P>In a related case, in October 2004, the U.S. Supreme Court turned down a 
request by Catholic Charities in California to review a state supreme court 
decision upholding a similar California law, the California Women&#8217;s 
Contraceptive Equity Act.&nbsp; Like New York&#8217;s law, California&#8217;s requires 
employers that provide prescription drug benefits to include contraceptive 
coverage and includes a similarly tailored exemption for religious 
institutions.&nbsp; The ACLU filed a friend-of-the-court brief in the California 
case as well.</P>
<P>Today&#8217;s case is <EM>Catholic Charities v. Serio</EM>, Case No. 96621. Lawyers on the 
ACLU and NYCLU brief include Kasdan, and Julie Sternberg of the ACLU 
Reproductive Freedom Project and Benjamin, Arthur Eisenberg and Galen Sherwin of 
the NYCLU.<!-- #EndEditable -->
