<p>WASHINGTON - January 23 - The Abramoff scandal is not about one person's misconduct.&#160; It is about a system that has taken hold in Congress that has led to one of the biggest public corruption scandals in recent history.<br />
&#160;<br />
Rep. Tom DeLay (R-TX) and his K Street Project created an environment in which lobbyists have risen in power and prestige on Capitol Hill based on the amount of money they could raise for their favored members of Congress.&#160; The needs of lobbyists and their clients have become more important than constituents who cannot pay to play.<br />
&#160;<br />
Meanwhile, the ethics committees in the House and Senate have been unwilling or unable to enforce the official rules of conduct in Congress.<br />
&#160;<br />
The combination of these two forces - lobbyists being woven into the fabric of our legislative process and an environment free of accountability for unethical behavior - have produced the Abramoff scandal.<br />
&#160;<br />
It's time fix this system and the forces that created it.&#160; The first step is an independent ethics commission that will take seriously the enforcement of rules governing the behavior of both lobbyists and members of Congress.&#160;<br />
&#160;<br />
Talk is cheap.&#160; Rhetoric, or legislative language that is not accompanied by strong, independent enforcement, may give us a few months of better behavior but not real reform.
<p>The second and more long-term goal is to enact clean campaign laws for all federal officials, so that they will not have to depend on lobbyists to raise the campaign funds they so desperately need for each election.&#160; Lobbyists are valuable to Members because they can raise millions of dollars from their clients.&#160; The only way to curb the influence of unscrupulous lobbyists like Jack Abramoff is to remove their power as fundraisers.<br />
&#160;<br />
Common Cause and its 300,000 members are committed to cleaning up the system, and to ensuring that Americans once more have faith in their elected representatives and in Congress.&#160;</p>
