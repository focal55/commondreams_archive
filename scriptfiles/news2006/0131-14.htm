<p>WASHINGTON - January 31 - Eli Pariser, Executive Director of MoveOn.org Political Action, criticized President Bush’s State of the Union message this evening for continuing to mislead the American people about the Administration’s occupation of Iraq. 
 
<p>“We’re on the wrong track in Iraq. As many of our most distinguished former generals and anti-terrorism experts now observe, our occupation makes a political solution impossible by fueling the insurgents,” Pariser said.
 
<p>Pariser was just as critical about the President’s failure to offer effective solutions to some of the most pressing problems facing Americans at home—high prescription drug and gasoline prices. “We need to fix the Bush prescription drug plan that subsidizes big pharmaceutical companies at the expense of senior citizens. We need to stop the oil companies from obscene profiteering, which reduces the standard of living for so many Americans. As usual, this Administration prescribes the same quack medicine for all our ailments: tax breaks for the richest Americans and the largest, most profitable corporations,” Pariser added.
 
<p>“While the President talks, MoveOn’s 3.3 million members are out working very hard to elect a  Congress that will offer real solutions to the nation’s problems,” he concluded.
