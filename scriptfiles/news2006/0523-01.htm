<p>WASHINGTON - May 23 - Amnesty  International USA (AIUSA) today reported that governments  worldwide, in the name of fighting terror, are committing gross  violations of human rights: mistreating suspects, harming  civilians and undermining their ability to solve some of the  world's most urgent problems. The organization highlighted the  U.S. government's current system for outsourcing key military  detention, security and intelligence operations as fueling  serious human rights violations and undermining accountability,  at the organization's release of its 2006 Annual Report on the  status of human rights in 150 countries. </p>
<p>   &quot;The United States has become a world leader in avoiding human  rights accountability; a case in point is the reliance of the  United States government on private military contractors, which   has helped create virtually rules-free zones sanctioned with the  American flag and fire power,&quot; said Larry Cox, who became AIUSA's  executive director May 1. &quot;Business outsourcing may increase  efficiency, but war outsourcing may be facilitating impunity.  Contractors' illegal behavior and the reluctance of the U.S.  government to bring them to justice are further tarnishing the  United States' reputation abroad, hurting the image of American  troops and contributing to anti-American sentiment. These results  are a distressing return on the U.S. taxpayers' billion-dollar- plus investment and undermine what remains of U.S. moral  authority abroad.&quot; </p>
<p>   The United States' outsourcing is just one example of  governments running roughshod over basic freedoms in the name of  fighting terrorism that the organization cited in the release of  its Annual Report. The Uzbek government murdered several hundred  peaceful demonstrators last spring, justifying the slaughter as  pursuit of terrorists. According to Egypt's Prime Minister, the  United States has transferred some 60-70 alleged terrorism  suspects to Egypt. Amnesty International reported the case of an  Egyptian national who was abducted in Milan and eventually taken  to Egypt, where he was allegedly tortured; his whereabouts remain  unknown.</p>
<p>   In Colombia, government security forces, backed with billions  of dollars from the United States, collude with paramilitary  forces deemed terrorist organizations by the U.S. State  Department to commit serious human rights violations. </p>
<p>   &quot;Legitimate concerns about terror are being used to justify  the unjustifiable,&quot; said Cox. &quot;Pressure from the U.S. government  has added to governments' willingness to violate long-held  principles, with allies colluding with the United States to  abduct alleged terrorism suspects and send them to countries that  torture or providing the real estate for CIA-run secret sites.  These violations undercut the political capacity of U.S. leaders  to confront increasing repression in certain African countries,  such as Ethiopia; press the Chinese government for meaningful  reform, and challenge repression and violence against those who  challenged faulty elections in Egypt, for example.&quot;</p>
<p>   In the rush to war and with little notice, the U.S. government  has outsourced billions of dollars in contracts to private  companies, leaving to civilians some of the most essential and  sensitive functions in the war, including protecting supply  convoys, guarding prisoners, translating during interrogations  and conducting interrogations. Despite the weak requirements for  reporting crimes, allegations have surfaced implicating civilians  working for the U.S. government in mistreatment of Iraqi and  Afghan civilians, including hundreds of incidents of shootings at  Iraqi civilians and abuse of detainees, including involvement in  the Abu Ghraib torture scandal.  </p>
<p>   Currently the contractors operate in a virtually rules-free  zone; they are exempt from Iraqi law per a Coalition Provisional  Authority order and they fall outside the military chain of  command. </p>
<p>   Of the 20 known cases of alleged misconduct by civilians in  the war on terror that were forwarded by the Pentagon and CIA to  the U.S. Department of Justice for investigation, DOJ has  dismissed two, brought one indictment, while the remaining 17 are  classified as open.</p>
<p>   AI places responsibility jointly on the Bush administration  and companies to overhaul the contracting system from top to  bottom to ensure safety of suspects and civilians and  investigation and prosecution when rights are violated. In  particular, the U.S. government should create and enforce  unambiguous, transparent and consistent mechanisms for reporting  on, investigating and, when necessary, prosecuting contractors  involved in detainee abuse and/or excessive use of force against  civilians. Every contractor involved in detentions or who might  use force against civilians must undergo a background check and  receive human rights and humanitarian law training. </p>
<p>   Private military companies, should, among other things,  implement a comprehensive human rights policy; monitor and  periodically issue public reports on its implementation; screen  employees and train them on international human rights standards;  make public the results of investigations the company may conduct  into alleged human rights abuses by employees; and disclose the  terms of U.S. government contracts with respect to human rights. </p>
<p>   &quot;These companies call themselves private military firms and  have tried to abandon negative labels like 'mercenaries,'&quot; said  Mila Rosenthal, Business and Human Rights Program Director for  Amnesty International USA. &quot;They want to be considered  respectable companies doing a respectable job. If they don't want  to be viewed as the scruffiest dogs of war, they must take their  human rights responsibilities seriously. They have to understand  the human rights implications of deploying often armed personnel  into war zones and ensure that they have company-level policies  to prevent and redress abuses.&quot;  </p>
