<p>WASHINGTON - March 16 - An analysis by Corporate Crime Reporter released today found that foreign companies in trouble with federal criminal prosecutors were much more likely than their U.S. counterparts to be convicted of a crime.

<p>Corporate Crime Reporter studied eighty-four (84) major corporate crime investigations resolved by the Justice Department over the past two years.

<p>A whopping 93 percent (28) of the 30 foreign corporations in the sample had their cases resolved by pleading guilty to crimes.

<p>Only 7 percent (2) of the foreign companies had their cases resolved by deferred or non prosecution agreements.

<p>On the other hand, only 59 percent (32) of the 54 U.S. companies in the sample pled guilty to crimes, while 41 percent (22) were granted deferred or non prosecution agreements.

<p>In addition, the vast majority of the 32 U.S. companies that pled guilty to crimes appear to be small, closely held corporations, while virtually all of the 28 foreign companies convicted of crimes are large multinational corporations, said Russell Mokhiber, editor of Corporate Crime Reporter.

<p>"Since the indictment and trial of Arthur Andersen, it is just very unlikely for a large, publically held U.S. corporation to be convicted of a crime," Mokhiber said. "The chances are approaching zero. If you are a major U.S. corporation and you get into trouble with the law, bet on getting a deferred or non-prosecution agreement. If your lawyer can't get you one, get another lawyer."

<p>Under a deferred prosecution agreement, a corporation is charged with a crime, admits wrongdoing, promises to change it's ways, and in some cases is appointed a monitor.

<p>If the company stays out of trouble for the term of the agreement - usually 18 months or two years - the government drops the charges at the end of the term.

<p>Under a non-prosecution agreement, the government agrees not to charge the company, sometimes in exchange for the company promising to change its ways.

<p>The 84 corporations in the sample were chosen by adding the corporate guilty plea cases reported in the pages of Corporate Crime Reporter over the past two years (60) to the corporate deferred and non prosecution agreements (24) reported over that period.
