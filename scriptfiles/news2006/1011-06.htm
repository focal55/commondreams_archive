<p>WASHINGTON  - October 11 - Consumer groups today  blasted the Justice Department for approving without restriction  the merger between telephone giants AT&amp;T and BellSouth -- the  largest telecommunications merger yet, a move likely to leave  consumers with fewer choices and inflated prices for a host of  services. </p>
<p>   &quot;DOJ's rubberstamp on this merger suggests the Justice  Department has thrown in the towel on competition between the  Bell phone companies,&quot; said Gene Kimmelman, senior vice president  for Consumers Union.  &quot;The Justice Department has abdicated  responsibility to promote the competition it promised when it  broke up AT&amp;T 20 years ago,&quot; he added. &quot;In the end, the majority  of consumers will end up paying inflated prices that result when  Bell companies merge and dominate local, long distance, wireless  and Internet services in their territories.&quot; </p>
<p>   The AT&amp;T/BellSouth merger is just the latest in a ten-year  wave of consolidation following passage of the 1996  Telecommunications Reform Act -- legislation intended to unleash  competition among the baby Bells in both local and long-distance  service. Instead, the eight baby Bells consolidated into just  four companies and gobbled up long distance carriers. Just last  year, DOJ approved the SBC and Verizon buyouts of long distance  carriers AT&amp;T and MCI, respectively. Meanwhile, competition in  local phone service has declined as Bell companies sued to  eliminate pro-competitive policies in the Act. </p>
<p>   Despite claims that this merger might foster competition  between phone companies and cable giants, the fact is that cable  companies are just now entering the phone market and are not  positioned to compete with the national phone behemoth that will  exist as a result of this merger.  The other potential competitor  -- voice-over-internet phone service (VOIP) -- that relies on  broadband connections, is threatened by the ability of the Bells  and cable companies with broadband wires to disrupt VOIP  transmissions. </p>
<p>   According to Mark Cooper, research director for Consumer  Federation of America, &quot;New Internet telephone service which  could compete against phone companies can now be blocked by the  merging AT&amp;T and BellSouth giant.  Consumers know that without  real competition, prices will continue to go up and the drive for  innovation will evaporate.&quot; </p>
<p>   &quot;DOJ's decision today makes the Federal Communications  Commission's review of the  merger even more critical,&quot; said  Kimmelman. &quot;With DOJ closing up shop on competition, FCC needs to  step up and impose meaningful conditions that will salvage what  little competition is left. The government has been deceived  before by false promises that mergers of potential competitors  benefit the public. It should not be fooled again.&quot; </p>
