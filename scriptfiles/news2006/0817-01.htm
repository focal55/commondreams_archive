<p>WASHINGTON - August 17 - The following is an  analysis released by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities:</p>
<p>   &quot;DON'T POP THE CORKS: CBO Outlook for the Federal Budget Is  Still Bleak&quot;</p>
<p>   By James Horney and Richard Kogan</p>
<p>   The Congressional Budget Office today released new budget  projections showing a deficit of $260 billion for fiscal year  2006, which will end on Sept. 30. Although such a deficit would  be $30 billion lower than the Office of Management and Budget  estimated on July 11, and just over $100 billion less than CBO  projected last March (excluding the effects of legislation  enacted since March), the new CBO projections of spending,  revenues and deficits through 2016 are not cause for celebration  by those troubled by the bleak federal budget outlook. Among the  reasons those concerned with fiscal responsibility should not break out the champagne are:</p>
<p>   1) CBO is not projecting that revenues will be higher in 2006  than the Administration estimated last month -- CBO and the  Office of Management and Budget both project that revenues will  total $2.403 trillion this year. CBO is projecting a lower  deficit for 2006 than OMB did because it believes federal  agencies will spend less of the funds currently available to them  by the end of the fiscal year than the agencies reported to OMB.  (In some instances, that simply means that more of the funds will  be spent next year.)</p>
<p>   2) A deficit of $260 billion in 2006 would represent the  largest six-year deterioration in the budget in 50 years. In  2000, there was a surplus equal to 2.4 percent of Gross Domestic  Product. A deficit of $260 billion this year would be equal to an  estimated 2.0 percent of GDP. That 4.4 percentage point  deterioration in the budget would be the worst six-year  deterioration in half a century (the next worse was from 1998 to 2004, when the deterioration was slightly less than 4.4  percentage points). This deterioration is hardly a reason for  jubilation.</p>
<p>   3) The outlook for the budget over the next 10 years (much  less for the following decades, when increasing numbers of baby  boomers will retire) remains bleak. CBO's projections show that,  if the President's tax cuts are made permanent and relief from  the alternative minimum tax is extended, deficits will total  nearly $3.5 trillion over the next 10 years (2007-2016),  averaging $349 billion a year and never dipping below $284  billion a year even if the costs of the war in Iraq and  Afghanistan decline substantially in a few years. This does not  represent a significant improvement in the longer-term budget  outlook that CBO issued in March. In fact, CBO's report says  &quot;...the general fiscal outlook for the coming decade remains  about the same as what CBO projected in March.&quot; </p>
<p>   4) Even with revenues now projected to reach a higher level in  2006 than was anticipated earlier this year, revenue growth over  the current business cycle has been considerably lower than in  comparable periods in the past. In fact, revenue growth in the  current business cycle is near zero after adjusting for inflation  and population growth. That is, real per capita revenues have  simply returned to the level they reached more than five years  ago in 2001, when the last economic recovery peaked (and thus  came to an end) and the current business cycle started. In  contrast, in previous post-World War II business cycles, real per  capita revenue growth over the five and a half years following a  business-cycle peak has averaged about 10 percent. The sluggish  growth in revenues over the last five and a half years -- and the  fact that the current economic expansion remains weaker than the  average post-World War II economic recovery -- do not support  Administration claims that the President's tax cuts have boosted  economic and revenue growth toremarkable levels.</p>
<p>   CBO's deficit estimate of $260 billion in 2006 illustrates one  other reality as well. Based on Joint Committee on Taxation  estimates, the total cost of tax cuts enacted since January 2001  in 2006 is $258 billion (including the increased interest costs  of the debt that result from the borrowing that is required to  cover the lost revenues). This means that even with the spending  for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and the response to  Hurricane Katrina, the federal budget would essentially be in  balance this year if the tax cuts had not been enacted, or if  they had been offset by either increases in other taxes or cuts  in programs, as would have been required under the Pay-As-You-Go  rules that tax-cut proponents first ignored and then allowed to  expire.</p>
