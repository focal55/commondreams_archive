<p>NEW YORK  - November 28 - Proposed closings, downsizings and 
consolidations of New York hospitals recommended by a state commission today 
could endanger community access to reproductive health services, women's health 
advocates warned today.
<P>The Reproductive Rights Project of the New 
York Civil Liberties Union, the MergerWatch Project and Planned Parenthood of 
New York City urged state and local policymakers to hold public hearings on the 
potential impact of the newly released recommendations of the New York State 
Commission on Health Facilities in the 21st Century.&nbsp; </P>
<P>The groups say that public hearings are 
essential to ensure that each proposed closing, downsizing or merger be 
individually evaluated for its impact on access to care. The "fast-track" 
approval process - under which the governor has just one week to accept or 
reject the recommendations in total, and the Legislature has only until the end 
of December - is ill considered and fails to permit the proper evaluation of the 
recommendations, the groups said.</P>
<P>"We are concerned that three of these 
proposed closings and mergers would seriously impair local women's ability to 
get adequate health services," said Elisabeth Benjamin, Director of the NYCLU 
Reproductive Rights Project. "After taking public comments back in the spring, 
the Commission has made all of its decisions behind closed doors, and their 
recommendations clearly fail to consider the impact these proposed closures and 
mergers have on women's health.&nbsp; The 
public must be permitted a chance to comment on the Commission's report." 
</P>
<P>Benjamin noted that the Commission proposes 
to merge Kingston Hospital and Benedictine Hospital, which are located a short 
distance from each other in Kingston, even though the community previously 
objected to Benedictine's proposal to impose Catholic health care restrictions 
on the merged entity.&nbsp; 
</P>
<P>Other closings and mergers of concern for 
their possible adverse impact on women's health are the closure of Bellevue 
Hospital and proposed merger of Ellis Hospital and St. Claire's Hospital in 
Schenectady County, the proposed merger of Niagara Falls Memorial Medical Center 
and Mount St. Mary's Medical Center in Lewiston, and the proposed merger of 
Arnot Ogden Hospital and St. Joseph's Hospital in the Syracuse region.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Lois Uttley, Director of the MergerWatch 
Project, warned that the proposed mergers of religious and secular hospitals 
could leave women without a local hospital that provides a full range of 
reproductive health services. Catholic-affiliated hospitals prohibit a number of 
reproductive health services, including contraception, tubal ligations, 
vasectomies, abortions, in vitro fertilization and discussion of condom use to 
prevent sexually transmitted disease</P>
<P>"Extra care must be taken to ensure that 
access to reproductive health services is not sacrificed in these proposed 
religious/secular hospital mergers," Uttley said. </P>
<P>Joan Malin, President &amp; CEO of Planned 
Parenthood of New York City, said that while some women's reproductive services 
can be provided at outpatient clinics, hospitals remain important providers of 
such care as post-partum tubal ligations, bedside contraceptive counseling for 
new mothers and abortions for women with complicating factors. 
</P>
<P>"While we certainly applaud the idea of 
directing additional resources to enhance the delivery of outpatient primary 
care in New York, hospital-based reproductive health care must still be 
maintained as a top priority," Malin said.</P>
<P>The three organizations urged state 
policymakers to refuse to go along with an agreement recently negotiated between 
outgoing Governor George Pataki and the federal government that conditions 
receipt of more than $1 billion in federal funds on acceptance and 
implementation of the hospital commission's recommendations.<!-- #EndEditable -->
