<p>REYKJAVIK, Iceland - November 1 - The  International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW) –  <a href="http://releases.usnewswire.com/redir.asp?ReleaseID=75468&Link=http://www.ifaw.org">http://www.ifaw.org</a> -- today welcomed continued diplomatic  pressure against the Icelandic government due to its whaling  policy. Ambassadors from 25 countries plus the EU Commission  delivered the demarche -- a diplomatic statement signed by  representatives of the countries -- to the Icelandic foreign and  fisheries ministries. </p>
<p>   The demarche expresses the countries’ opposition to the  resumption of commercial whale hunting and asks the Icelandic  government to reconsider its policy. &quot;We are heartened by the  strong global reaction and hopeful that the Icelandic government  will reconsider its misguided decision,&quot; said Joth Singh, IFAW's  director of Wildlife and Habitat Protection. &quot;We have no quarrel  with the people of Iceland. Beyond the endangered whales  themselves, the clear victims of this government decision are  Iceland's tourism industry and international reputation.&quot;</p>
<p>   In an announcement that has generated unprecedented media  coverage worldwide, Iceland's Minister of Fisheries, Einar K.  Gudfinnsson, issued hunting permits for nine endangered fin  whales and 30 minke whales on Oct. 17. Since then, Iceland  whalers have killed seven endangered fin whales and one minke  whale. </p>
<p>   Fin whales are second only to the blue whale in terms of size,  growing to average lengths of 18-22m and weights of 30-80 tons.  Hunted in significant numbers by whalers in the past, they are  now considered endangered under the World Conservation Union  (IUCN) guidelines. Minke whales are smaller, with lengths of up  to 10m and are characterized as lively and curious. </p>
<p>   By tradition, Icelanders do not consume fin whale meat,  leaving only Japan as a potential buyer for the whale meat. But  Japanese Ambassador to Iceland Fumiko Saiga publicly announced  that Japan did not want the meat, citing current whale meat  surpluses in Japan.</p>
<p>   Said Dr. Singh, &quot;With no market for the meat, the question  remains: why has the government recently revived such a wasteful  and economically unnecessary pursuit from the past?&quot; </p>
<p>   The full list of countries signed on to the demarche is:  France, United States, Germany, UK, Italy, Australia, Belgium,  Mexico, Portugal, Brazil, Argentina, New Zealand, Chile, Spain,  Finland, Ireland, Israel, Monaco, the Netherlands, Sweden,  Luxembourg, Austria, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Peru, along  with the EU Commission.</p>
<p>   IFAW is calling on its 2.5 million supporters worldwide to  take action against the government's decision to resume  commercial whaling. To learn more, visit <a href="http://releases.usnewswire.com/redir.asp?ReleaseID=75468&Link=http://www.ifaw.org">http://www.ifaw.org</a>  today.</p>
