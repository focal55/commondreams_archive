<p>WASHINGTON - December 4 - The Supreme Court will hear two cases today that will decide the 
fate of racial diversity in public schools, according to the American Civil 
Liberties Union, which filed a brief with the Court in both cases.
<P>The cases arise from challenges to diversity programs in public schools in 
Seattle and Louisville, Kentucky. While the school districts differ in the 
details of their programs, school officials in both cities determined that there 
were important educational reasons to maintain a racially diverse student body. 
To reach that goal, school officials may consider race as a factor when 
assigning students to a particular school if its racial balance is out of step 
with the district as a whole.</P>
<P>&#8220;The Supreme Court is poised to influence whether school systems will reflect 
the increasingly diverse face of America, or whether future schools will look 
more like those from our segregated past,&#8221; said Dennis Parker, Director of the 
ACLU Racial Justice Program. &#8220;Racial diversity programs help ensure all students 
receive an equitable education, and prepares our young people for life beyond 
the school walls.&#8221; </P>
<P>Three years ago, the Supreme Court ruled that public universities have a 
compelling interest in a racially diverse student body that permits them to use 
race as a factor in their admissions program. Today&#8217;s cases raise related issues 
for K-12 education.</P>
<P>In <EM>McFarland v. Jefferson County Public Schools</EM>, the legal attack on the 
efforts of Kentucky&#8217;s Jefferson County to maintain desegregated schools 
highlights the historical ironies of the effort to end voluntary school 
desegregation. As the result of an ACLU of Kentucky lawsuit, Jefferson County 
operated under federal court supervision from 1973 to 2000, and was compelled to 
take steps to desegregate schools that had previously been segregated on the 
basis of race. Once court supervision ended, the Jefferson County School 
District continued to make efforts to maintain desegregated schools, having 
found that racially integrated learning environments benefited all students 
educationally.</P>
<P>Although Seattle has never been under court order to desegregate its schools, 
its efforts also go back decades. Beginning in the 1960&#8217;s, Seattle tried to 
correct the racial imbalance in schools that resulted from stark patterns of 
residential segregation. After trying a series of approaches and considering a 
range of alternatives, Seattle adopted a plan for the 1998-1999 school year in 
which students would be allowed to choose between schools. Admission to 
over-subscribed schools would be determined by four &#8220;tie-breakers,&#8221; one of which 
considered race and would come into play only if the over-subscribed school were 
racially imbalanced. This attempt to address racial imbalance resulted in the 
current challenge to the program, <EM>Parents Involved in Community Schools v. 
Seattle School District</EM>.</P>
<P>Like Jefferson County, Seattle&#8217;s commitment to diverse schools resulted from 
its belief that doing so would achieve valuable educational goals for all of its 
students that could only occur in racially diverse settings. Both districts now 
face the prospect of being barred from achieving these goals through the use of 
a voluntary desegregation program.</P>
<P>&#8220;The Supreme Court has previously recognized that the state has a compelling 
interest to achieve racial diversity in education. Forcing schools to abandon 
any reliance on race would unfortunately deprive many school districts of the 
ability to achieve that goal,&#8221; said Steven R. Shapiro, National Legal Director 
of the ACLU.&nbsp; </P>
<P>In its friend-of-the-court brief, the ACLU responds to the argument that 
racial diversity can be achieved solely through race-neutral measures, such as 
assigning students to schools based on socioeconomic factors. Through a review 
of the federal government&#8217;s own data, the ACLU concludes that neither magnet 
schools nor socioeconomic criteria have proved sufficient, by themselves, to 
address the re-segregation that plagues so many school districts across the 
country.</P>
