<p>NEW YORK / WASHINGTON - January 19 - Though interest groups 
are continuing to run television advertisements for and against the confirmation 
of Judge Samuel Alito to the U.S. Supreme Court, the highly anticipated air war 
over his nomination did not reach the levels many political observers expected, 
according to the latest television airtime estimates.&nbsp; New data released 
today by the Brennan Center for Justice at NYU School of Law and the Justice at 
Stake Campaign shows the groups combining to spend slightly under $2.2 million 
for and against Alito since his nomination on October 31.&nbsp; The data is 
complete through January 14. </P>
<P>The $2.2 million figure is dramatically less than both sides had vowed to 
spend on their campaigns, and less than the estimated $5-$10 million spent on TV 
airtime earlier in 2005, when groups pressured Senators on the judicial 
filibuster issue.</P>
<P>“Recent reports suggest that funds may have been spent more on ground wars 
than on television advertising campaigns,” said Deborah Goldberg, director of 
the Democracy Program at the Brennan Center for Justice.&nbsp; “It will be 
interesting to see whether this strategy spills over to judicial elections this 
year or whether spending on airtime continues its upward spiral.”</P>
<P>According to press accounts, the chief conservative interest group, Progress 
for America (PFA), had promised to spend over $10 million if necessary to 
support from the President nominees to the Supreme Court.&nbsp; To date PFA has 
spent a total of slightly over $2 million on TV ads in connection with the 
Roberts, Miers and Alito nominations.&nbsp;&nbsp; More was spent defending 
Roberts, even though Alito’s nomination has generated the most opposition. </P>
<P>Opponents of the President’s nominees have also combined to spend slightly 
over $2 million, with about three-quarters of that money being spent in 
opposition to Judge Alito.&nbsp; The liberal groups remained silent on the 
nomination of Harriet Miers.&nbsp; The liberal advertising largely came under 
the umbrella of a coalition called IndependentCourt.org, though NARAL, 
MoveOn.org, and People for the American Way also sponsored television ads under 
their banners criticizing Roberts and Alito during the confirmation 
processes.</P>
<P>“Perhaps the 2005 filibuster wars depleted interest group war chests in 
advance of the recent nomination battles,” said Bert Brandenburg, executive 
director of Justice at Stake.&nbsp; “Whatever the reason, the air wars in the 
federal confirmation process were tame compared with recent advertising in state 
Supreme Court elections, where interest groups spent more than $7 million in 
2004.”&nbsp; (More data can be found in The New Politics of Judicial Elections 
2004, published by Justice at Stake, the Brennan Center and the Institute on 
Money and State Politics.)</P>
<P>The data for the project is gathered by TNS-Media Intelligence/CMAG, which 
tracks the nation’s top 100 broadcast markets and national cable advertising and 
provides estimates on the cost of each TV spot.&nbsp; Data and previous 
releases, as well as storyboards and streaming video of ads available to date, 
are available at brennancenter.org and justiceatstake.org. </P></p>
