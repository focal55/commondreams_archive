<p>NEW YORK  - May 24 - Responding to reports that phone companies are turning over 
private details about Americans&#8217; telephone calls to the National Security 
Agency, the American Civil Liberties Union today launched a nationwide 
initiative to end illegal government spying.
<P>ACLU affiliates in 20 states today filed complaints with Public Utility 
Commissions or sent letters to state Attorneys General and other officials 
demanding investigations into whether local telecommunications companies allowed 
the NSA to spy on their customers.</P>
<P>&#8220;We cannot sit by while the government and the phone companies collude in 
this massive, illegal and fundamentally un-American invasion of our privacy,&#8221; 
said ACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero.&nbsp; &#8220;And unfortunately, we 
cannot wait for Congress to act. The ACLU is mobilizing its members and 
supporters nationwide to&nbsp;demand investigations into this shocking 
breach of trust.&nbsp; And we are asking the FCC to use its authority to uncover 
the facts about how far the president's illegal spying has gone. The American 
people want answers.&#8221; </P>
<P>The ACLU today also sent a letter to the Federal Communications Commission 
urging the agency to reconsider its refusal to investigate reports that at least 
three major telecommunications companies -- AT&amp;T, BellSouth and Verizon -- 
cooperated with the NSA in an effort to collect calling information and call 
patterns on every American.&nbsp; </P>
<P>In its letter, the ACLU refuted the agency&#8217;s assertion &#8211; made public late 
yesterday &#8211; that the classified nature of NSA activities render it &#8220;unable&#8221; to 
investigate potential wrongdoing.&nbsp; The ACLU noted that the government is 
publicly defending the program, so there is no way that all the details about it 
are &#8220;state secrets&#8221; or involve classified information.&nbsp; The letter also 
pointed out that the government has a recent history of overclassifying 
information and conveniently claiming that any evidence of embarrassing or 
illegal actions are &#8220;state secrets.&#8221;</P>
<P>In the complaints sent to state utilities commissions and other officials 
around the country, the ACLU is also alling for investigations into the unlawful 
sharing of billions of consumers&#8217; call records with the NSA.&nbsp; If the 
sharing is found to be in violation of state law, the ACLU is urging that 
officials issue &#8220;cease-and-desist&#8221; orders to the telecommunications companies in 
their state. </P>
<P>&#8220;It&#8217;s time to shed light on this illegal invasion of privacy that could 
affect everyone in this country,&#8221; said Carol Rose, Executive Director of the 
ACLU of Massachusetts, which today filed a complaint on behalf of its 22,000 
members and four Massachusetts city mayors, seeking a public hearing into 
possible violations of state law. &#8220;The purpose of this effort is not to obstruct 
legitimate law enforcement activities, but to protect the basic privacy and due 
process rights of people whose telephone records have been divulged without a 
warrant, notice or consent.&#8221;</P>
<P>In addition to the ACLU of Massachusetts, actions were filed today by ACLU 
affiliates in Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Iowa, Kansas, 
Massachusetts, Missouri, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, 
Rhode Island, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia and Washington.&nbsp; Other 
ACLU affiliates are expected to file additional letters and complaints in the 
coming weeks. </P>
<P>As part of its nationwide campaign, the ACLU today is running full-page 
advertisements in <EM>The New York Times</EM> and half a dozen major daily newspapers, 
with the headline: &#8220;If You&#8217;ve Used a Telephone in the Last Five Years, Read 
This.&#8221;&nbsp; The advertisement provides a link to www.aclu.org/dontspy, where individuals 
can add their names to the public record in the ACLU&#8217;s complaints with Public 
Utility Commissions and send e-mails to the FCC urging that it investigate the 
matter.&nbsp; The ad is also running in the <EM>Seattle Times</EM> and Seattle 
<EM>Post-Intelligencer</EM>, <EM>Philadelphia Inquirer</EM>, <EM>Boston Globe</EM>, <EM>Chicago Tribune</EM>, <EM>Miami 
Herald</EM>, <EM>Portland Press Herald</EM> (Maine) and the <EM>San Francisco Chronicle</EM>. </P>
<P>&#8220;We are seeking to create the perfect storm to end illegal NSA spying,&#8221; said 
Barry Steinhardt, director of the ACLU&#8217;s Technology and Liberty Program.</P>
<P>When the NSA spying program was initially uncovered last December, the ACLU 
was one of the first organizations to bring a legal challenge, acting on behalf 
of a prominent and politically diverse group of journalists, scholars and 
lawyers. That challenge will be heard before Judge Anna Diggs Taylor in Detroit 
on Monday, June 12; it will be the first ever hearing on the legality of NSA 
spying since the program was disclosed. </P>
