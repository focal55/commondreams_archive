<p>BOSTON - August 23 - One year ago, the US  government promised survivors of Hurricane Katrina that it would  take bold steps to address the deep inequalities the storm  revealed. Twelve long months later, government at all levels,  from the Bush Administration down to local officials, has yet to  make good on its pledge, according to international humanitarian  organization Oxfam America.</p>
<p>   Nowhere is that abdication more evident than in the critical  shortage of affordable rental housing -- often the only kind that  poor people can afford -- now gripping the Gulf Coast. Despite nearly $17 billion that Congress has approved to rebuild homes  and community infrastructure in Louisiana and Mississippi,  neither state has allocated nearly enough of those funds to  replace the affordable rental units lost in the storm. Further,  as of early August, not one house in those two Gulf Coast states  had been rebuilt with that money.</p>
<p>   In a new report released today entitled "Forgotten  Communities, Unmet Promises: An Unfolding Tragedy on the Gulf  Coast," (<a href="http://releases.usnewswire.com/redir.asp?ReleaseID=71129&Link=http://www.oxfamamerica.org">http://www.oxfamamerica.org</a>) Oxfam America catalogues  the lack of political will, the bureaucratic bungling and the  poor policy decisions that have contributed to this housing  crisis and left the region's poor further behind than ever.</p>
<p>   "Our government talked of its duty to rebuild the region,  particularly for the most vulnerable people and those hit the  hardest. Instead, poor communities have been pushed aside, pushed  down and pushed out," said Minor Sinclair, director of Oxfam  America's grant-making program in the US. "The rental crisis, for  which there are a range of available solutions, is just one  example of the gross inequities now playing out in this  recovery."</p>
<p>   The report explores the fate of three diverse places -- East  Biloxi, Miss., and rural communities in Louisiana's Plaquemines  and Vermilion parishes -- and shows how neglect at all levels of  government is robbing hard-working people of the brighter future  the administration vowed it would provide.</p>
<p>   "This is one of the largest reconstruction efforts in recent  U.S. history. All Americans expect the rebuilding to be fair and  to help those who need help most," continued Sinclair. "But so  far, that's not happening, and for some of the region's poorest  residents, things have only gotten worse during this recovery."</p>
<p>   Hundreds of Mississippi families in Gulfport and Pascagoula  face the prospect of losing their homes because the regional  housing authority plans to sell or transfer the buildings in  which they live. Scores of other people, packed into government- issued trailers, have had to live with what they suspect are  sickening levels of formaldehyde fumes while the Federal  Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has only recently decided to  conduct tests.</p>
<p>   Among the report's recommendations for addressing the  recovery's inequities are:</p>
<p>   -- To make eligibility requirements of homeowner assistance  inclusive by dropping the penalties imposed on people who did not  have insurance -- often because they could not afford it.</p>
<p>   -- To allot a proportional share of federal funds for the  replacement of affordable rental housing.</p>
<p>   -- To reform disaster housing assistance by passing the Post- Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act of 2006 which would help  people find permanent housing solutions more quickly while  minimizing waste and inefficiency.</p>
<p>   Oxfam America's report also features six profiles of  individuals struggling to make order from the chaos -- both  physical and psychological -- that hurricanes Katrina and Rita  left. Portraits shot by "Time" magazine photographer Steve Liss  illustrate these stories and capture the hardships other Gulf  Coast residents have endured.
