<p>WASHINGTON - February 15 - In response to the release on Australian television yesterday of what appear to be new photos of torture and abuse of detainees in U.S. custody at Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq, the Center for Constitutional Rights (CCR) called for a complete, transparent independent investigation into the torture and abuse of detainees that goes all the way up the chain of command.  

 

<p>CCR filed a Freedom of Information Act request jointly with the American Civil Liberties Union, Physicians for Human Rights, Veterans for Common Sense, and Veterans for Peace, and followed with a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court by those same groups on June 2, 2004, charging the Department of Defense and other government agencies with illegally withholding records concerning the abuse of detainees in American military custody. The government has yet to release the images requested.  The photos and videos from that suit are known as the Darby photos. Joseph Darby was the U.S reservist who turned over the photos and videos to U.S. Army officials and touched off the Abu Ghraib scandal in April 2004.

 

<p>According to attorneys with the Center for Constitutional Rights, it cannot yet be confirmed that these are the Darby photos, though at least two show the infamous Spc. Charles Graner with detainees, and attorneys have not seen these photos previously.  Members of Congress have seen the <a href="http://smh.com.au/news/world/the-photos-america-doesnt-want-seen/2006/02/14/1139890737099.html">Darby photos and videos</a>. CCR has no knowledge of how the Australian press obtained them.
<p>Said CCR Legal Director Bill Goodman, "The Bush Administration continues to undermine the purpose of the Freedom of Information Act, which is to provide transparency in government to the American people.  In this case, the government's concealment is that of a matter which goes to the heart and soul of American democracy, the use of torture by American officials.  Now the rest of the world is learning through a leak that which this government desperately struggles to conceal from its own people. No one up the chain of command has ever been held accountable for what is in these horrifying images, and no true independent commission or special prosecutor has ever been allowed to investigate.  There must be an independent investigation and an independent prosecutor must be appointed. The public has a right to know what was being done in our name and what continues to be done at detention camps and secret prisons around the globe."

 

<p>Said CCR Deputy Legal Director Barbara Olshansky, "We are saddened by the displays of inhumanity in these images.  Yet the only time the U.S. government acts is when they are forced to by revelations such as this:  had they released these images properly and held high-level officials accountable at the time, we would not be facing the repercussions we will surely see in the reactions around the world."  

 

<p>Said CCR President Michael Ratner, "What we see here is a direct consequence of this Administration's disregard for the rule of law.  This Administration has not only violated international and domestic law against abuse and torture, it has rewarded those who have sought to overturn the Geneva Conventions, the most important protections that exist for our own soldiers.  This Administration has put our troops at risk and caused world-wide anger by fostering policies that promote torture and refusing to hold those responsible publicly accountable.  There is ample evidence that the torture and abuse were not the actions of a few bad apples, but that responsibility goes up the chain of command to Rumsfeld, Gonzales and others. It is long past the time to hold them accountable. The president's statement when he signed the McCain Amendment is a strong indicator that the administration plans to continue its unlawful practice of torture."

 

<p>In response to the rights groups' lawsuit, the government had requested and received an extension from the judge stating that they needed time in order to redact the faces of the men, women and children believed to be shown in the photographs and videos.  They were given until this past July to produce the images, but at the eleventh hour filed a motion to oppose the release of the photos and videos, based on an entirely new argument:  they requested a 7(F) exemption from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act to withhold law enforcement-related information in order to protect the physical safety of individuals. That move was one more in a series of attempts by the government to keep the images from being made public and to cover up the torture of detainees in U.S. custody around the world.  

 

<p>This is part of the request under the Freedom of Information Act filed by the Center for Constitutional Rights, the ACLU, Physicians for Human Rights, Veterans for Common Sense and Veterans for Peace. The FOIA lawsuit is being handled by Lawrence Lustberg and Megan Lewis of the New Jersey-based law firm Gibbons, Del Deo, Dolan, Griffinger & Vecchione, P.C. 

 

<p>The Center for Constitutional Rights has additional cases pending against the government for torture and abuse at Guantánamo and against the private military contractors CACI, Inc., and Titan for their involvement in the abuse at Abu Ghraib and other facilities in Iraq.
