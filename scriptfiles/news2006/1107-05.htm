<p>NEW YORK - November 7 - Miles Rapoport, president  of Demos, a national public policy and research center and former  Secretary of the State of Connecticut, issued the following  statement on emerging problems on Election Day:</p>
<p>   &quot;As voters across the nation go to the polls today, we are  hopeful of a strong turnout, a day of real participation at the  end of a long and hard-fought campaign season. This is a day that  is already testing our administrative systems. Early reports say  there are problems cropping up in numbers of states. They include  problems with databases, leading to people who are in fact  eligible being told that they can only vote on provisional  ballots; shortages of machines and in some cases poll workers and  confusion over the new voter identification laws.  </p>
<p>   &quot;Election officials, campaigns and voting rights advocates  around the country are working to address these issues. In  addition to the immediate fixes, we need to learn the lessons  from today's experience and continue to advance the  administration of elections in the country. Allowing Election Day  registration will alleviate list problems and provisional ballot  issues. More investment in poll worker training will help. And  real standards for machine functioning and transparency are  essential.</p>
<p>   &quot;We urge voters to go to the polls, bring the identification  required by your state, ask about your rights if you are denied a  ballot and work through any issues that arise. We also urge  election officials to resolve issues in ways that encourage  participation and engagement. Voters who experience problems  today should call the Election Protection hotline at 1-866-Our- Vote, where not only can problems be resolved, but where a  database of those problems is being assembled to assist with  future improvements. And after today, we will all need to  continue to work to improve our system so that everyone can vote  and be confident their vote will count.&quot;</p>
