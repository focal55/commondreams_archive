<p>WASHINGTON - December 5 - On Dec. 11 in Nashville, all five Federal Communications Commissioners will meet face-to-face with the public to discuss sweeping changes to the nation's media ownership rules.<BR><BR>WHAT: Official FCC Hearing on Media Ownership<BR>WHEN: Monday, Dec. 11, 2006, 1 p.m.<BR>WHERE: Massey Performing Arts Center, Belmont University, 1900 Belmont Blvd, Nashville<BR>WHO: FCC Commissioners, national and local leaders, media representatives and concerned citizens.<BR><BR>All five FCC Commissioners are expected to attend the hearing, which will feature an "open microphone" session for the public to offer testimony on a first-come, first-served basis.<BR><BR>"This hearing is a long overdue opportunity for the public to weigh in on the crucial decisions that shape our media," said Josh Silver, executive director of Free Press which is helping to mobilize public participation in the hearings. "Before letting Sinclair, Gannett or Clear Channel swallow up more local media outlets, FCC Chairman Kevin Martin and the other commissioners need to hear how these Big Media firms are serving &mdash; or failing to serve &mdash; local communities in Tennessee and throughout the South."<BR><BR>A broad-based coalition of local and national groups is urging their members to attend the hearings and testify about the impacts of media consolidation. They include the American Federation of Musicians, American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (AFTRA), The Belcourt Theater, Center for Rural Strategies, Christian Community Broadcasters, Communications Workers of America, Consumers Union, EarthMatters Tennessee, Free Press, Mid-South Peace and Justice Center, Nashville Peace and Justice Center, Newspaper Guild-CWA, Prometheus Radio Project, Rainbow/PUSH, Tennessee Alliance for Progress, Tennessee Healthcare Campaign, Tennessee Immigrant and Refugee Rights Coalition, Tennessee Independent Media Center, The Belcourt Theater and WRFN Radio Free Nashville.<BR><BR>"Healthy democracies are built on informed citizens," said Tim Marema of the Center for Rural Strategies. "Whether you are talking about a local zoning issue or national immigration policy, citizens need information to make the democratic system work. Ultimately, the decisions we reach are only as good as the accuracy, timeliness, and authenticity of the information that the public receives. But because of the concentration of media ownership, there are fewer and fewer people in the media industry who understand rural communities."<BR><BR>"The cornerstone of our democracy is a free and independent media that is not controlled by corporate interests," said Nell Levin, host of the Tennessee Progress Report on Radio Free Nashville. "Without this, our society is becoming one where only those with the most money are heard. This is dangerous to democracy and to the values of freedom, justice and equality. We are calling on the FCC to support a move away from media consolidation and toward policies that allow many voices to be heard."<BR><BR>The FCC is currently reviewing longstanding media ownership rules, including the prohibition on newspaper/broadcast cross-ownership &mdash; which prevents companies from owning a television or radio station and the major daily newspaper in most markets &mdash; and limits on the number of television and radio stations a firm can own in one area.<BR><BR>"If you already think local newspapers and TV news provide biased coverage, just imagine how much worse things will get if the government lets your local newspaper and biggest TV station combine operations and dominate local news," said Gene Kimmelman, vice president of federal and international affairs for Consumers Union. "Tennesseans and all Americans benefit when more competition comes from independently owned news sources, and that's why it makes no sense for the government to let a few companies dominate the most important sources of local news."<BR><BR>In 2003, Martin joined then-Chairman Michael Powell in voting to seriously weaken these same media ownership rules. In response, millions of people contacted the FCC and Congress to oppose the changes. The Senate voted to overturn the rules, which were later tossed out in federal court &mdash; sending the FCC back to the drawing board.<BR><BR>The Nashville event is the second hearing of six that Chairman Martin has pledged to hold nationwide "in diverse locations around the country to fully involve the American people." The first hearing was held in Los Angeles on Oct. 3 and attended by nearly 1,000 people who overwhelmingly opposed the possible rule changes. Unofficial hearings, attended by Commissioners Michael Copps and Jonathan Adelstein, have been held this year in Norfolk, Va.; Asheville, N.C.; Los Angeles; Milwaukee; Austin, Texas; Oakland, Calif.; New York City; Hyde Park, N.Y.; and Seattle.<BR><BR>Prior to the official hearing, there will be three workshops in Nashville discussing media policy and helping local residents prepare their testimony. The workshops will be held:<BR><BR>Wednesday, Dec. 6, 7 p.m.<BR>Film Screening: Before the Music Dies<BR>The Belcourt Theatre<BR>2102 Belcourt Avenue, Nashville<BR>Contact: Hannah Sassaman: 267-970-4007<BR><BR>Thursday, Dec. 7th, 7:30 p.m.<BR>Nashville Peace and Justice Center<BR>1016 18th Ave S, Nashville<BR>Contact: Amanda Ballantyne: 612-849-0195<BR><BR>Saturday, Dec. 9th, 2 p.m.<BR>Nashville Peace and Justice Center<BR>1016 18th Ave S, Nashville<BR>Contact: Amanda Ballantyne: 612-849-0195<BR><BR>For more information, visit <A HREF="http://www.stopbigmedia.com/=nashville">www.stopbigmedia.com/=nashville</A></p>
