<p>BRUSSELS (BELGIUM) / LONDON (UK) - July 14 - G8 plans to address 
global energy security are dirty, dangerous and will continue to fuel 
climate change, Friends of the Earth International warned today on the 
eve of the G8 summit taking place in St Petersburg, Russia [1].

<p>An early draft of the G8 Plan of Action suggested that world leaders had 
forgotten last year’s G8 efforts in Gleneagles to tackle climate change.

<p>Despite G8 pledges to take action against climate change, the draft plan 
currently includes backwards proposals for major investment in finding 
new oil and gas reserves, for increased oil refining capacity and for 
greater reliance on nuclear power. [2]

<p>Catherine Pearce, Friends of the Earth International climate campaigner 
said:
<blockquote>“Last year heads of state at the G8 summit in Gleneagles recognised the 
urgent need for decisive action against climate change whilst 
‘eradicating energy poverty’ around the world. But this action plan is a 
backward step which will mean a return to dinosaur-like dependence of 
fossil fuels. If the world’s richest countries are serious about 
tackling climate change and energy security,, they must look to the 
solutions and heavily invest in energy efficiency and the clean, 
renewable energies, which is what most people want.[3]</blockquote>

<p>Collectively the G8 nations, which represent just 13 per cent of the 
world’s population, are responsible for 45 per cent of the world’s 
greenhouse gas emissions.

<p>The G8 summit is expected to reaffirm last year’s commitments on 
renewable energies and energy efficiency as well as “eradicating energy 
poverty”. But such laudable plans are little more than window-dressing 
in light of the focus given to triggering investments in fossil fuel 
extraction and the use of nuclear power, Friends of the Earth said.

<p>Jan Kowalzig, Friends of the Earth Europe climate campaigner said: "It is unbelievable to see how our leaders are holding the world in the 
grip of dirty energy, feeding our addiction to oil instead of overcoming 
our dependence on fossil fuels. At a time of high oil and gas prices, 
political instability in producer countries, the threat of climate 
change and rising mountains of nuclear waste, common sense dictates 
cutting energy waste and investing in renewable energies like solar and 
wind -- this will ensure a long-term sustainable energy supply."

<p>Friends of the Earth is particularly concerned by recent attempts to 
revive the nuclear industry despite its economic failures over the past 
50 years [4].

<p>Although European Commission President José Manuel Barroso, who will 
attend the G8 summit, has highlighted the need to promote greenhouse gas 
reduction and large scale use of renewable energy, the EU’s own energy 
policy is still strongly dominated by political and financial support 
for fossil fuels and nuclear power.
EU leaders calling for more nuclear power at the G8 summit act against 
the interests of their citizens, who do not consider nuclear power a 
solution to secure energy supply in the long-term [5]. Over 400,000 
Europeans have so far signed a petition to phase out nuclear power. [6]


<p>Friends of the Earth International wants to see commitments from the G8 
leaders in the following areas:

<p>1. Global average temperatures must not be allowed to rise two degree 
centigrade higher than pre-industrial levels . To minimise the risks of 
warming above two degrees centigrade global greenhouse gas emissions 
need to peak and decline within the next 10-15 years. An average of two 
degrees could mean up to five or six degrees centigrade increase in some 
parts of the world. Just 2-3 degrees centigrade of warming could mean up 
to 300 million more people will be at risk of malaria, three billion 
will face water shortages and 100 million people will be more at risk 
from coastal flooding. We are already 0.6C higher now than 
pre-industrial levels.

<p>2. An agreement by G8 nations for specific, substantial and timetabled 
cuts in their domestic emissions of greenhouse gases. G8 leaders must 
commit themselves to strong future actions to combat climate change. 
These should include increased efforts to meet Kyoto targets, and a 
clear signal that their commitments will increase after 2012 (when the 
first commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol is due to end). Crucial 
talks on international action to tackle climate change are scheduled to 
take place in Nairobi, Kenya, later this year.

<p>3. An agreement that offers innovative and substantial financing 
mechanisms to increase and diversify the energy mix. This must include 
more renewable energy and greater efforts towards energy efficiency. 
Broad economic instruments such as mandatory cap and trade need to run 
alongside specific support mechanisms for renewable energy and demand 
reduction. There are clear funding streams from international 
institutions and agencies which, with a strong steer from governments, 
can divert greater financial support to these proven technologies. G8 
countries must stop promoting fossil fuel extraction in developing 
nations through international financial institutions such as the World 
Bank and export credit agencies and immediately phase-in public finance 
for sustainable clean energy.

<p>4. Urgent assistance is needed for those developing countries already 
facing the devastating effects of climate change. These are countries 
which have done nothing to contribute to the current threat of climate 
change. Much is already understood on how these countries will be 
affected. Money and increased support must be given now.

<p>[4] Not a single nuclear power plant has ever been built without direct 
or indirect subsidies through taxpayers’ money. And, each Euro invested 
in nuclear energy would save ten times more greenhouse gases if it was 
invested in energy efficiency measures instead. See “Nuclear power: 
economics and climate protection potential”: Rocky ountains Institute; 
January 2006; available at <a href="http://www.rmi.org" target="_new">http://www.rmi.org</a>
<p>[5] A recent Eurobarometer poll shows the only 12% of Europeans believe 
that developing the use of nuclear energy would give a satisfactory 
answer to the current challenges of security of energy supply, growth of 
energy consumption and climate change. See
