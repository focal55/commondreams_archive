<p>WASHINGTON - May 19 - The House of Representatives acted today to protect the public’s right-to-know about toxic chemicals released to our land, air, and water. Recognizing the importance of maintaining currently available toxic release information, the House voted to stop EPA from proceeding with a proposal to deprive thousands of communities across the country access to toxic pollution information. 

<p>The House stood up for the American public and paid notice to the more than 110,000 comments submitted in opposition to EPA’s rollback of the Toxic Release Inventory. In so doing, the House sent a clear message to EPA that the public’s right-to-know about toxic chemicals in communities is a paramount right that must not be eroded. 

<p>EPA’s October 2005proposal would significantly reduce the amount of information available to the public about the toxic pollution from thousands of facilities across the nation. The proposal to begin withholding currently available toxic release information is widely opposed and includes opposition from agencies in 23 states and the U.S. Conference of Mayors. 

<p>Unfortunately, today’s vote may not be enough to stop EPA from proceeding with the rollbacks. But, with widespread public opposition and disapproval from one chamber of Congress, the legitimacy of EPA’s proposal has been seriously called into question.
