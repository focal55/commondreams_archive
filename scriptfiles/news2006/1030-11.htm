<p>WASHINGTON - October 30 - U.S. Senator Russ Feingold has joined a number 
          of Senate colleagues in writing to Secretary of Education Margaret Spellings 
          and Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld calling for an increase in 
          Impact Aid. In their letter, the Senators ask that funding for Impact 
          Aid Basic Support Payments be raised from $36.5 million to $46.2 million 
          per year over the next 4 years. Among those affected by Basic Support 
          Payments are children whose parents are in the Armed Services, children 
          who reside on Native American lands, and children who reside in public 
housing. </p>
        <p>&#8220;Protecting Impact Aid is vital to the well-being of many communities 
          in Wisconsin and I am pleased to be joining my colleagues in a call 
          to increase this program&#8217;s funding,&#8221; said Feingold, a member 
          of the Senate Impact Aid coalition. </p>
          
        <p>The Impact Aid program was created to assist local school districts 
          that have lost tax revenue due to the presence of tax-exempt federal 
          property, or that enroll Native American children, military dependent 
          children or other children associated with federally connected lands. 
          Funding for basic support payments has fallen over the past five years, 
          and money is now being shifted away from needed construction and facility 
          maintenance projects to make up for the shortfall. </p>
          
        <p>The Senators encourage Spellings and Rumsfeld to work with the Department 
          of Education and the Department of Defense to ensure Impact Aid has 
          adequate funding for FY 2008. They also request that schools and communities 
          affected by future changes in the Impact Aid program be fully informed 
          about the timing and movement of students into or out of their districts. 
        </p>
          
        <p>&#8220;The Impact Aid program offers critical support to a growing 
          number of children, and federal support for the program should reflect 
          how important these funds are for so many schools and communities,&#8221; 
Feingold said.<!-- #EndEditable -->
