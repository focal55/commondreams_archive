<p>ORLAND, California - May 9 - Farm Sanctuary, the  nation's leading farm animal rescue, education and advocacy  organization, announced today that its Orland, Calif. and Watkins  Glen, N.Y. shelters are open for tours. The Orland sanctuary is a  300-acre shelter home to over 400 farm animals and the Watkins  Glen sanctuary is a 175-acre refuge for nearly 800 cows,  chickens, ducks, geese, turkeys, pigs, sheep, rabbits and goats.  Farm Sanctuary's shelters rescue, rehabilitate and provide  lifelong care for farm animals who have been rescued from  stockyards, factory farms, slaughterhouses and cruelty cases.  Here, the animals are given all the care and love needed to  recover from abuse and neglect. </p>
<p>   Farm Sanctuary's &quot;animal ambassadors&quot; have a very special way  of reaching and teaching people, and these shelters are  sanctuaries for people as much as they are for farm animals. Farm  Sanctuary shelters offer farm tours, overnight accommodations,  retreats, weddings and conferences. </p>
<p>   The 2006 California Shelter season runs from April 1 through  November 30. Guided tours are offered on Saturdays, every hour on  the hour, from 11 a.m. until 3 p.m. The New York Shelter season  runs from May 6 through October 31. During May, September and  October, guided tours are held Saturday and Sunday on the hour  from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. From June through August, guided tours are  held Wednesday through Sunday on the hour from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m.  On tour days, Farm Sanctuary guests are also welcome to browse a  unique visitor center and country gift shop. </p>
<p>   In addition, Farm Sanctuary offers reservations for overnight  stays at the Country Cabin in California and B&amp;B cabins in New  York located on the shelter grounds. Accommodations can also be  found nearby in the town of Orland, Calif. or at the Black Butte  Lake Recreation Area, and near Watkins Glen, N.Y. throughout the  beautiful Finger Lakes region. Details on accommodations are  available at <a href="http://releases.usnewswire.com/redir.asp?ReleaseID=65445&Link=http://www.farmsanctuary.org/visit/index.htm">http://www.farmsanctuary.org/visit/index.htm</a>. </p>

<p>   About Farm Sanctuary </p>
<p>   Farm Sanctuary is the nation's leading farm animal protection  organization. Since incorporating in 1986, we have worked to  expose and stop cruel practices of the &quot;food animal&quot; industry  through research and investigations, legal and legislative  actions, public awareness projects, youth education, and direct  rescue and refuge efforts. Our shelters in Watkins Glen, N.Y. and  Orland, Calif. provide lifelong care for hundreds of rescued  animals, who have become ambassadors for farm animals everywhere  by educating visitors about the realities of factory farming.  More information about Farm Sanctuary can be found at  <a href="http://releases.usnewswire.com/redir.asp?ReleaseID=65445&Link=http://www.farmsanctuary.org">http://www.farmsanctuary.org</a> or by calling 607-583-2225. </p>
