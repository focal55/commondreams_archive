<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">TOLEDO, Ohio  - February 14 - The American Civil Liberties Union of Ohio 
today sent a letter to the Toledo Public Schools demanding that they cease 
allowing staff to teach intelligent design in science classrooms throughout the 
district.<BR>
<BR>
"Intelligent design has been proven to be nothing more 
than a thin cover for those who wish to teach creationism, a faith-based idea of 
human origins endorsed by certain Christian denominations, in science classes," 
said ACLU of Ohio Legal Director Jeffrey Gamso. "While people have a right to 
teach their religious beliefs to others in churches, mosques, synagogues and 
private schools, public schools should not be used by people to teach their 
personal religious beliefs to other people's children."<BR>
<BR>
Gamso 
added, "Proponents of intelligent design have been unable to provide any 
credible scientific evidence to support their theories. The scientific community 
has, time and again, largely refuted purported evidence supporting intelligent 
design. By continuing to allow teachers to implement intelligent design into the 
science curriculum, educators are misinforming Ohio's children on the 
fundamental principles of science."<BR>
<BR>
Recently, a news article in the 
Toledo Blade featured teachers in the Toledo Public School system who admitted 
teaching intelligent design in science classrooms. In the article, teachers 
acknowledged they taught lessons on various pieces of evidence that seemed to 
refute evolutionary theory, despite the fact that all were proven to be hoaxes 
by the scientific community.<BR>
<BR>
The battle over intelligent design in 
Ohio schools began in 2002 when the State Board of Education endorsed teaching "critical analysis of evolution," which is no more than a way of slipping 
intelligent design, and therefore creationism, into the public schools through 
the back door, according to the ACLU.<BR>
<BR>
Following a court ruling in 
Dover, Pennsylvania in late 2005 that the local school board's decision to teach 
intelligent design was unconstitutional, many in Ohio called for the State Board 
of Education to reexamine its science standards.<BR>
<BR>
"As Ohio students 
compete with people from other states and nations for jobs in science and 
technology, allowing the teaching of intelligent design as a science standard 
will diminish their ability to compete in the economy," Gamso 
said.<BR>
