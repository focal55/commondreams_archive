<p>WASHINGTON - April 19 - With millions of  Americans set to miss the May 15 cut-off date to sign up for  Medicare's complicated new prescription drug program, dozens of  organizations representing millions of members are calling on  Congress to extend the enrollment deadline. Seniors who haven't  signed up for the new prescription drug program have less than  one month to enroll.</p>
<p>   Those who miss the May 15 deadline will have to wait for the  next sign-up period and face delayed coverage and higher premium  costs, but the Bush administration says it won't extend the  deadline for everyone.</p>
<p>   Sen. Debbie Stabenow, D-Mich., and Rep. Pete Stark, D-Calif.,  joined leaders from several groups on a conference call with  reporters today to press Congress to let all Medicare  beneficiaries sign up for the new drug benefit after May 15, just  as the administration has agreed to do for some low-income  people.</p>
<p>   Sen. Stabenow said that seniors all across Michigan have  contacted her about the problems they are having with the  Medicare prescription drug program.</p>
<p>   &quot;This program is overly complex, it is confusing and seniors  need more time to make the right decision. Congress needs to act  quickly to extend the enrollment deadline for everyone,&quot; said  Sen. Stabenow. &quot;These aren't just issues of bureaucracy and  inconvenience. When it comes to seniors and people with  disabilities getting the medicine they need, it can be a matter  of life and death.&quot;</p>
<p>   Rep. Stark urged the Bush administration to extend enrollment  through the end of the year and waive the late enrollment penalty  for all Medicare beneficiaries.</p>
<p>   &quot;Rather than listen to the corporate interests that oppose the  extension of the prescription drug enrollment deadline, the  president ought to listen to seniors and people with disabilities  who support it,&quot; said Rep. Stark.</p>
<p>   Campaign for America's Future co-director Roger Hickey joined  Sen. Stabenow and Rep. Stark on today's conference call. Hickey  announced the launch of a citizens' campaign, run by Americans  United, to force all senators and members of Congress to tell  their constituents where they stand on extending the deadline.</p>
<p>   &quot;Medicare's Part D is so hopelessly flawed that the enrollment  deadline must be extended to give Congress time to fix this  debacle,&quot; said Hickey. &quot;It's immoral to penalize seniors and the  disabled for their failure to sign up for a plan that should have  never been this difficult and confusing in the first place. The  new prescription drug program is costly, confusing and corrupt  and it has left millions without drugs.&quot;</p>
<p>   Hickey's group, Campaign for America's Future, is a member of  the Americans United coalition. Leaders of dozens of groups  affiliated with the coalition will gather at AFSCME's Washington  headquarters today to hold a strategy meeting. USAction and other  organizations working closely with Americans United are planning  to hold dozens of events this month in Penn., Wash., Fla., Iowa,  Minn., Mont., Tenn. and Maine to pressure Congress to extend the  deadline and fix Part D.</p>
<p>   Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., Sen. Olympia Snowe, R-Maine, and 46  other senators also joined the fight today by sending Senate  Majority Leader Bill Frist, R-Tenn., a letter urging him to  extend the deadline. Extension of the enrollment deadline would  result in an additional 1.1 million sign-ups this year  and lower  late-enrollment penalties for 10 million seniors and people with  disabilities for the rest of their lives, according to the  nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.
