<p>WATKINS GLEN, New York - August 2 - Farm Sanctuary,  the nation's leading farm animal protection organization, today  released a research report addressing highway accidents in the  United States involving farm animals. Farm Sanctuary has  submitted this report with recommendations to more than 40  officials with government agencies, industry trade organizations  and agribusiness companies, calling for a proper reporting  structure and establishment of protocols to protect farm animals  at risk during transport.</p>
<p>   Of the ten billion animals slaughtered for food every year in  the U.S., most, at some point in their lives, travel by truck,  usually in-route to the slaughterhouse. Farm Sanctuary conducted  a survey of media archives to locate information about farm  animal transport accidents, in which a total of 233 accidents  were identified for a recent six-year period. A significant  percentage of the animals involved in these accidents died or  were severely injured. Veterinarians and humane society officials  were rarely called to the scene to help the injured animals.</p>
<p>   Although the U.S. government does not monitor farm animal  transport accidents and has done little to address the problem,  governments of other countries have taken action on the issue.  Canada's &quot;Recommended Code of Practice for the Care and Handling  of Farm Animals&quot; includes specific information on responding to  highway accidents involving farm animals. The U.S. animal  agriculture industry has not, for the most part, developed any  policies or procedures to deal with animal transport accidents.</p>
<p>   &quot;Thousands of animals are dying on U.S. highways and there are  no protocols in place to handle these accidents,&quot; said Gene  Bauston, president of Farm Sanctuary. &quot;First responders are not  equipped to handle the care of farm animals in accidents, and  neither government nor agribusiness claims responsibility while  animals and people remain at risk.&quot;</p>
<p>   The 233 accidents included in Farm Sanctuary's report occurred  in 44 states. States with the highest number of accidents in the  survey include Kansas with 23 accidents, Texas and Pennsylvania  with 14 each, and Missouri with 13. Virginia and California had  12 each. The states with the most accidents are not surprisingly,  the states with a large slaughter industry. Agribusinesses listed  repeatedly in connection with transport accidents include Perdue  Farms (chickens), Cargill (pigs), Foster Farms (chickens and  turkeys), and ConAgra (chickens). The company with the most  accidents was Smithfield Foods, with 10 separate accidents  involving pigs during the six-year period.    </p>
<p>   Recommendations to the U.S. government and industry include:</p>
<p>   -- The U.S. government and animal agriculture industry should  track animal transport accidents and their causes. Information  about transport accidents should be made available to the public  and used to help prevent future accidents and to improve the  treatment of animals affected by these accidents.</p>
<p>   -- The trucking and animal agriculture industries should  design trailers with a reduced risk of rollover. Double-decker  trailers should be eliminated. Drivers of animal transports  should be educated about the prevention of tractor-trailer  rollover. Federal and state government should enact limits on the  duration of animal transport journeys and on animal stocking  densities and require two drivers for lengthy journeys.</p>
<p>   -- States and counties should develop accident protocols that  include the provision of emergency veterinary treatment by  government or private practitioners. All states should enact  veterinary &quot;Good Samaritan&quot; laws.</p>
<p>   -- The animal agriculture industry should develop accident  protocols and emergency teams to respond to the scene of major  transport accidents.</p>
<p>   -- State and county governments should hold first responder  training in animal rescue, care and handling.</p>
