<p>WASHINGTON - July 18 - Today, WakeUpWalMart.com, America's campaign to change Wal-Mart, launched a new Web site and political outreach campaign in response to Wal-Mart's vicious "swift-boat" style attack Web site, <a href="http://paidcritics.com" target="_new">http://paidcritics.com</a>. WakeUpWalMart.com's new Web site, <a href="http://www.ABunchOfGreedyRightWingLiarsWhoWorkForWalMart.com" target="_new">http://www.ABunchOfGreedyRightWingLiarsWhoWorkForWalMart.com</a>, outlines the deep and disturbing right-wing connections behind Wal-Mart's attack machine and links some of Wal-Mart's newly hired right-wing operatives to some of the most vicious political smear campaigns in American political history, including attacks on John Kerry in the 2004 election, CBS News, and attacks on Democrats in the 2000 Florida Recount. 

<p>Wal-Mart's attack Web site, <a href="http://paidcritics.com" target="_new">http://paidcritics.com</a>, is an unprecedented and dangerous decision by a $300 billion dollar corporation. It is the first time in history that a corporation has set up, directly funded and openly managed a Web site whose sole purpose is to attack Democrats, WakeUpWalMart.com staff personally, and all parties who want Wal-Mart to become a better employer.

<p>"Wal-Mart's decision to spend millions of dollars hiring right-wing political operatives to attack Democrats and personally smear people who want health care for its workers is a shameful act of desperation. At the same time Wal-Mart is publicly trying to put a smiley face on its company, Wal-Mart has decided to unleash a 'swift boat' style attack on all of those people who want Wal-Mart to change for the better," stated Paul Blank, campaign director for WakeUpWalMart.com.

<p>The Web site, <a href="http://www.ABunchOfGreedyRightWingLiarsWhoWorkForWalMart.com" target="_new">http://www.ABunchOfGreedyRightWingLiarsWhoWorkForWalMart.com</a> will provide a detailed account of Wal-Mart's right-wing conspiracy including ties to the most extreme element of the Republican Party, Tom Delay, George W. Bush, Karl Rove and John Ashcroft, a biographic summary of the key right-wing operatives involved in the Wal-Mart war room, and an accounting of Wal-Mart's extensive political contributions to Republicans. In addition, the Web site will give the American people the opportunity to vote for their favorite Wal-Mart right-wing liar and view our latest TV ads on "Right Wing" TV -- a new channel dedicated to exposing Wal-Mart's right wing connections.

<p>"If Wal-Mart thinks they can intimidate us with right-wing operatives who are willing to defend child labor abuses and oppose universal health care, Wal-Mart is sorely mistaken. We are not critics. We are a movement of Americans who are fighting for living wages, affordable health care, protecting U.S. jobs and holding corporations accountable for their behavior," added Blank.

<p>As part of the new counteroffensive, WakeUpWalMart.com also sent all of the Democratic Members of Congress a personal letter outlining Wal-Mart's vicious attack campaign being run by the public relations firm Edelman. The letter highlights just how desperate Wal-Mart has become to attack Democrats, WakeUpWalMart.com's campaign staff, progressive groups and all those who strive to make Wal-Mart a more responsible company. A copy of the letter is available at <a href="http://www.wakeupwalmart.com" target="_new">http://www.wakeupwalmart.com</a>.
