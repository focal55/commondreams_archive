<P>BRUSSELS / WASHINGTON - February 28 - Friends of 
the Earth International made available online today a confidential World 
Trade Organization ruling on the trade dispute on biotech, or 
genetically modified (GM) foods. [1]

<P>The 1000-page report, which was distributed earlier this month only to 
the countries involved in the dispute, was leaked to Friends of the 
Earth, which published today February 28 a preliminary analysis in the 
briefing 'Looking behind the US spin'. [2]

<P>The leaked report reveals that:

<P>
<ul>
<li>Despite claims of victory by the US Administration and the 
biotechnology industry -widely reported in the media in February 2006- 
the three countries that started the trade dispute against the European 
Union (US, Canada and Argentina) failed to win most of their arguments;<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>The World Trade Organization (WTO) did not rule on two of the most 
important questions, namely whether GM foods are effectively the same as 
non-GM foods and if they are safe.</li>
</ul>
<P>"The WTO ruling is not a victory for the US administration and the 
biotech giants. Countries around the world should continue to enforce 
tough legislation protecting their citizens and the environment from the 
risks of genetically modified crops," said Juan Lopez, GM Campaign 
Coordinator of Friends of the Earth International.

<P>According to Friends of the Earth International the WTO is not and 
should not be the appropriate body to deal with conflicts between trade 
rules and environmental protection since it ignores the internationally 
recognised 'Precautionary Principle' and considers only trade principles.

<P>The leaked WTO report argues that:

<P>
<ul>
<li>Europe's 4-year moratorium on GM Organisms (GMOs) only broke trade 
rules because it caused "undue delay" in the approval of new GM foods. 
The WTO dismissed eight other complaints in relation to the moratorium, 
and did not recommend any further action, since the moratorium ended in 
2004.<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>There was also an "undue delay" in the EU's approval procedures for 
over 20 specified biotech products. However, eleven other claims of the 
complainants related to the product-specific EU measures were dismissed 
by the WTO Panel.<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>National bans by EU member states broke trade rules because the risk 
assessments used by the countries in question did not comply with the 
WTO requirements; </li>
</ul>
<P>"This is the report that the WTO didn't want the public to see. It 
reveals that the big corporations that stand behind the WTO failed to 
get the big win they were hoping for. Free trade proponents needed a 
clear victory in this dispute to be able to push governments in the EU 
and the developing world to accept genetically modified food. They 
failed and now is the time to build a consensus that the WTO, with its 
business-only agenda, is the wrong place to decide on what people eat 
and how we protect our environment," said Adrian Bebb, GMO campaigner 
for Friends of the Earth Europe in Brussels.
