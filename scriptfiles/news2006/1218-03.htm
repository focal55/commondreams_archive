<p>WASHINGTON - December 18 - Sue Gunawardena-Vaughn,  director of Amnesty International USA's Program to Abolish the  Death Penalty, issued the following statement in response to U.S.  District Judge Jeremy Fogel's ruling that California's lethal  injection procedure represents &quot;an undue and unnecessary risk&quot; of  a violation of the constitutional prohibition against cruel and  unusual punishment:</p>
<p>   &quot;Judge Fogel's ruling comes at a time when numerous states  across the country are encountering significant legal challenges  to the constitutionality of their respective lethal injection  methods. Earlier today, in the wake of a horribly botched  execution, Florida Governor Jeb Bush created a commission on  administration of lethal injection to examine the  constitutionality of that state's lethal injection protocol.</p>
<p>   &quot;While Judge Fogel's ruling chastises California for continuing  to administer a procedure that 'lacks both reliability and  transparency,' the flaws that taint the state's death penalty  system go well beyond the specifics of its executing mechanism. It  is plagued by racial bias and there remains the very real  possibility of executing an innocent person. California officials  should not waste the state's valuable resources trying to  'perfect' the apparatus of death. Instead, they should  unequivocally reject the death penalty, which is both futile and  irreparably flawed, and focus instead on developing genuine  solutions to crime. The continuing search for an 'ideal' way to  extinguish a human life is no sign of a humane, evolved society.  California can and must do better.&quot;</p>
