<p>ROGERS, Arkansas - April 19 - In anticipation of  CEO Lee Scott's speech before the national media,  WakeUpWalmart.com, America's campaign to change Wal-Mart, called  on Wal-Mart to &quot;seize the moment for true change&quot; and &quot;work  together to make Wal-Mart a better company.&quot; The group, again,  offered to sit down with Wal-Mart CEO Lee Scott, and his  executive team, to find specific, fair and just solutions that  would improve the lives of its 1.3 million workers, their  families, and help change America for the better.</p>
<p>   WakeUpWalMart.com also announced it will be holding rallies in  35 cities all across America next week featuring its new national  campaign slogan - &quot;Change Wal-Mart, Change America.&quot; Beginning  next week, WakeUpWalMart.com will launch a series of initiatives  across the country based on this new message and theme.  As part  of this new grassroots push, WakeUpWalMart.com, already one of  America fastest growing movements in America with over 212,000  grassroots supporters, announced it is setting a goal of at least  1 million supporters by December 2008.</p>
<p>   As part of this new initiative, Paul Blank, campaign director  for WakeUpWalmart.com, issued the following statement:</p>
<p>   &quot;Now is the time for Wal-Mart to seize the moment for true  change. The American people are tired of publicity stunts, half- truths and empty words that have become synonymous with corporate  America.  Americans wants Wal-Mart to change for the better, to  be a responsible corporation, and to reflect the best of our  values.</p>
<p>   We renew our offer to work together with Wal-Mart on specific,  just and fair solutions to help make Wal-Mart a better business,  and we remain committed to our goal of making sure Wal-Mart pays  a living wage, provides affordable, comprehensive health care to  all of its workers, adopts a zero tolerance policy on child  labor, ends discrimination, protects American manufacturing jobs,  and addresses the community concerns of crime, traffic,  congestion and sprawl associated with a Wal-Mart store.</p>
<p>   The debate over Wal-Mart is now a major political, moral and  economic issue in America, and our campaign for social and  economic justice cannot and will not end until Wal-Mart changes.   In the coming months and year, we will grow our movement from  212,300 supporters to 1 million supporters who believe, like we  do, the American people have the power and the responsibility to  'Change Wal-Mart and Change America'.&quot;</p>
