<p>NEW YORK - July 14 - NetAid will host its second annual Global Poverty-Fighting Summit in New York City starting July 22, drawing over 40 high school students from across the nation. The students will be immersed in a week of intense learning about education, AIDS, hunger, and U.S. foreign assistance. Leading the sessions will be expert practitioners such as David Devlin Foltz from the Global Interdependence Initiative, Mary Beth Powers from Save the Children, and Kym Alnwick and Nomatola Mangqase from Ubuntu Education Fund, a nonprofit operating in New York and South Africa. Most importantly, students will return to their schools and communities to educate their peers. Last year's Corps spread anti-poverty messages to nearly 150,000 peers and adults and inspired actions to raise awareness about poverty worldwide.

<p>The summit kicks off the 2006-07 year of the NetAid Global Citizen Corps, a program which recruits student leaders to raise awareness about global poverty. The summit participants were selected from hundreds of applicants nationwide. They represent a diverse range of young Americans who come from 20 states, have roots in a dozen countries around the world, and speak 16 different languages. Overall, this year's national Corps will involve nearly 200 high schools across the country.

<p>"NetAid's programs are at the frontlines of global education. The students selected for this program understand, by virtue of their own family experiences and interests, that global poverty affects us all and that they can do something to change that reality at home and abroad," states Gary Knell, president of Sesame Workshop, who will deliver the keynote address at the summit reception. 

<p>NetAid's mission to educate, inspire, and empower young people to fight global poverty is more relevant than ever. "We believe that there are students in every high school across the country who want to learn more about global poverty and see themselves as part of the solution. Our programs strive to turn this early aptitude and appetite into a life-long commitment, and our summit participants are setting the pace," comments NetAid President Kimberly Hamilton. 

<p>The summit will be held at SUNY Maritime College in the Bronx from July 22 - 28. Training will address issues such as HIV/AIDS, malaria, and other diseases; access to education; clean water; and the Millennium Development Goals. Students will also tour the United Nations and build strong civic engagement skills with workshops on digital media, action planning, youth philanthropy, and communication strategies.

<p>Students from last year's Corps proved to be a mighty force in building momentum for anti-poverty campaigns. Students traveled to Capitol Hill to meet with Sens. Hillary Rodham Clinton, Elizabeth Dole, and Barack Obama among other national decision- makers; a Global Citizen Corps leader was named one of Teen People's "20 Teens Who Will Change the World;" others organized rallies to draw attention to poverty wrought by the genocide in Darfur. The near doubling of this year's Corps will build knowledge in many more schools and communities and is expected to educate an additional 150,000 students through innovative and entrepreneurial techniques crafted by the students themselves.
