WASHINGTON - March 21 - On March 24th 2006, members of Anti-Flag and Congressman Jim  McDermott (D-WA), the legislative leader on Depleted Uranium,  will hold a News Conference about the military's use of Depleted  Uranium in combat zones, including Iraq, and launch a petition  drive. The musicians worked with the congressman on their new  song, "Depleted Uranium is a War Crime" and premiered it with a  congressional action on After Downing Street Coalition's website  <a href="http://releases.usnewswire.com/redir.asp?ReleaseID=62701&Link=http://www.afterdowningstreet.org/?q=node/8592">http://www.afterdowningstreet.org/?q=node/8592</a>
<p>   They will talk about new actions to raise awareness of our  military's use of these deadly chemicals without studying their  long lasting effects on humanity.</p>

<p>   The talking segments of the "Song Depleted Uranium is a War  Crime" comes from an October, 2005, interview conducted by Justin  Sane of Anti-Flag with U.S. Representative Jim McDermott (D-WA).</p>
