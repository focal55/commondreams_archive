<p>WASHINGTON - May 26 - The American 
Civil Liberties Union today expressed concern as the Senate confirmed General 
Michael Hayden as the new Director of the Central Intelligence Agency.&nbsp; General Hayden was most recently Deputy 
Director of National Intelligence and was the Director of the National Security 
Agency when the illegal surveillance programs were 
initiated. <A href="/safefree/nsaspying/index.html">
</A>
<P>&#8220;Stepping into his new 
position, General Hayden must now conform to the rule of law,&#8221; said Caroline 
Fredrickson, Director of the ACLU Washington Legislative Office.&nbsp; &#8220;Not only permitting, but directing, the 
warrantless wiretapping of millions of Americans while head of the NSA is a 
troubling record.&nbsp; We are hopeful 
that General Hayden will begin anew and start respecting the constitutional 
rights of all Americans.&#8221;</P>
<P>The Senate confirmed Hayden 
today in a vote of 78-15, with a bipartisan group of senators opposing his 
confirmation. </P>
<P>General Hayden was 
questioned by the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, but refused to answer 
simple, direct questions from that panel.&nbsp; 
Hayden repeatedly declined to answer questions, noting that he would only 
respond in a &#8220;closed session&#8221; to a majority of the questions, including basic 
questions about following federal laws.&nbsp; 
His statements shed no new light on how far and wide the NSA&#8217;s illegal 
program has cast its net on innocent Americans.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Additionally, Hayden&#8217;s 
decision not to comment on the CIA&#8217;s policy on torture and unlawful rendition 
sends an unnerving message to a worldwide audience.&nbsp; The ACLU reiterated that these practices 
must be stopped and General Hayden must now play an integral part in bringing 
the CIA back in line with the Constitution and international human rights 
law.</P><P>&#8220;General Hayden&#8217;s 
confirmation hearing offered no useful information and was a disservice to the 
American people,&#8221; said Lisa Graves, Senior Counsel for Legislative 
Strategy.&nbsp; &#8220;The lack of vigorous 
questioning by some Senators was disappointing but General Hayden&#8217;s answers were 
even more so.&nbsp; Straightforward 
answers about straightforward national security and privacy issues should not be 
so easily eschewed.&nbsp; We can only 
hope that General Hayden will make a new start in his new role, and protect both 
Americans and our fundamental freedoms.&#8221;</P>
<P>The ACLU is a non-partisan 
organization and neither endorses or opposes government agency 
nominations.</P>
