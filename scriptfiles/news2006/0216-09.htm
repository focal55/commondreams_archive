<p>WASHINGTON - February 16 - Congressman Dennis J. Kucinich (D-OH), Ranking Member of the House Government Reform Subcommittee on National Security, Emerging Threats and International Relations, issued the following statement today on H. Con. Res. 341:

<p>"This bill undermines efforts towards a peaceful resolution of Iran's nuclear ambitions, and puts the United States on a dangerous path that could lead to war. This bill, and the debate in the House, have an eerie resemblance to similar debate and resolutions that led to the misguided and ill advised war in Iraq. 

<p>"This bill scuttles the only possibility for a peaceful resolution of this crisis.  Namely, the offer, by Russia, to enrich uranium for Iran to use in its nuclear power plants.  Iran would not operate any enrichment processing facilities of its own, and therefore would not have the ability to make isotopes of uranium suitable for weapons.  This is the essence of a resolution offered by Russia to avert the crisis. This is the only diplomatic option available to us today.  

<p>"Moreover, there is no imminent threat of Iran building a nuclear weapon.  This past summer, a National Intelligence Estimate on Iran's nuclear capabilities was released showing that Iran was 10 years away from building a nuclear weapon.  This estimate represents a consensus among the U.S. intelligence agencies.

<p>"The Security Council option, favored heavily by the bill, thinly veils the route to a military confrontation with Iran.

<p>"The Administration, covered by this bill, is leading this country to take military action against Iran.  Make no mistake, that is the US program at the UN, just as it was prior to the invasion of Iraq in 2003.  

<p>"If you think Muslim reaction to a political cartoon is bad, what do you think reaction will be when the US is attack Iran while it occupies Iraq?

<p>"This is a dangerous and deadly course the United States should not embark upon."
