<p>WASHINGTON - February 10 - South Carolina Electric &amp; Gas Company (SCE&amp;G) and Santee Cooper&#8217;s plan to build a new nuclear reactor at the Summer Nuclear Station near Jenkinsville, S.C., should not be permitted to come to fruition. Not only should the government refuse the companies&#8217; likely request for taxpayer subsidies to defray the costs of licensing and building a plant, but the government shouldn&#8217;t issue a license for this nuclear reactor at all.</p>

<p>No new reactors have been ordered in the&#160;United States for 30 years &#8211; and for good reason. Nuclear power is extremely expensive; in fact, no nuclear power plant has operated without taxpayer money since the nuclear power industry was born. Nuclear power poses a public safety and national security threat and creates dangerous highly radioactive waste, for which no country in the world has a solution.</p>

<p>If the companies are permitted to proceed with its proposal, taxpayers could be on the hook for cradle-to-grave subsidies, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>half the cost of applying for the license, estimated at as much as $45 million per application for pre-approved reactor designs;</li>

<li>&#8220;risk insurance&#8221; to pay the industry for delays in licensing, which could be up to $500 million for a single reactor;</li>

<li>taxpayer-backed loan guarantees for up to 80 percent of the cost of a project, potentially costing taxpayers more than $2 billion for one reactor; and</li>

<li>production tax credits of 1.8 cents for each kilowatt-hour of nuclear-generated electricity from new reactors during the first eight years of operation, estimated at a total of $5.7 billion&#160;in revenue losses to the U.S. Treasury through 2025.</li>
</ul>

<p>Public Citizen therefore calls on the government to deny these two companies federal dollars to subsidize the exorbitant costs of building a new nuclear facility and ultimately to deny the companies a license.</p>
