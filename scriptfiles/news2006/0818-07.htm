<p>MANILA, Philippines - August 18 -   Greenpeace ship MY Esperanza will sail towards Guimaras Strait this evening to join the Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) fleet working to contain and clean-up the Philippines largest ever oil spill in Philippine history.
</p>
        
      


Under an agreement with the PCG and other groups, the Esperanza and its
crew will conduct a joint visual survey with the PCG at the
southeastern tip of Guimaras Island, the worst-hit area where a
protected marine sanctuary has been badly devastated. The MY Esperanza
will also transport clean up and containment equipment to PCG units on
the ground, as well as relief goods donated by ABS-CBN Foundation to
affected communities.<br>
<br>
The Greenpeace ship and crew will also work with scientists and other
marine/ecology experts to undertake impact assessment and determine the
damage caused by the oil spill to important marine sanctuaries and
coastal ecosystems in the area.<br>
<br>
"The Philippine Coast Guard is enlisting Greenpeace in this short but
vital impacts assessment work," said Commander Joseph M. Coyme of the
Philippine Coast Guard."The information that Greenpeace and their
partner scientists provide will give us solid basis in continuing our
oil spill containment and mitigation work."<br>
<br>
"Our main concern is how the government can effectively mitigate the
impacts of this disaster to the marine environment and livelihoods of
people. It will take years to clean up and rehabilitate affected areas
and communities," said Von Hernandez, Campaign Director of Greenpeace
Southeast Asia. "In this regard, we reiterate our call on the
government to make Petron and its partners accountable for all the
costs associated with this disaster."<br>
<br>
The Esperanza is in the Philippines on the latest leg of her global
Defending Our Oceans expedition to highlight the wonders and the
environmental threats to the world's oceans and to campaign for the
establishment of marine reserves. Scientists recognize the Philippine
archipelago as the world's centre of marine biodiversity, but is also
the most highly threatened, citing the danger of mass extinction in a
scale similar to that of the destruction of the Brazilian rainforests.<br>
<br>On Friday, August 11, a Petron-chartered single hull vessel
carrying 2.1 million litres of oil sank in Guimaras Strait, which
Greenpeace characterized as an ecological time bomb that can cause
long-term and possible irreversible damage to the environment and
livelihoods of people.<br>
<br>
Greenpeace is an independent, campaigning organisation, which uses
non-violent, creative confrontation to expose global environmental
problems, and to force solutions essential to a green and peaceful
future.<br>
