<p>WASHINGTON - February 21 - The AFL-CIO today launched AFL-CIO Now: News that Works, a comprehensive news and opinion blog offering fresh, online information from around the country about issues affecting working people, unions and the AFL-CIO. 
<P>&ldquo;With AFL-CIO Now, we are bringing vital information on bread-and-butter issues directly to the people who can change things,&rdquo; said AFL-CIO President John Sweeney. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing like it out there and it couldn&rsquo;t come at a better time. It&rsquo;s a powerful new tool for working men and women, and it arrives just as we&rsquo;re seeing a surge of new energy from activists, union and non-union alike.&rdquo; </P><P>Today the new blog includes reaction from former Enron employees Digna Showers and Deborah Perrotta on the trial of former Enron CEOs Ken Lay and Jeff Skilling. Showers and Perrotta are two of the more than 21,000 Enron employees who nearly lost everything when the company&rsquo;s stock nose-dived amid allegations of financial irregularities and strange business deals. Also today, the site will include a feature on Ford&rsquo;s plan to close a Wixom, Mich. factory as part of its recent announcement to shut down 14 plants and cut 30,000 jobs, despite the fact that the factory was rated the third highest quality plant in North and South America by J.D. Power and Associates last year. </P><P>AFL-CIO Now provides news on worker organizing and political efforts, health care, the economy, jobs, retirement security and other issues, updated several times daily. It is designed to elevate workers&rsquo; issues in the blogosphere and strengthen grassroots action, while providing a new resource to members of the media and influentials in policy and government. </P><P>The blog adds a dynamic new element to the AFL-CIO&rsquo;s online presence, which already includes a popular website and a network of over half a million online activists. The AFL-CIO&rsquo;s network of activists have proven to be a potent force on behalf of working families &ndash;activists sent nearly 2 million faxes, calls and e-mails to Congress in a successful campaign to stop the Bush Administration&rsquo;s attempt to privatize Social Security. </P><P>AFL-CIO Now will also feature guest bloggers who will offer insight on issues and events shaping news relevant to working families. The site launches today with a blog from Greg LeRoy, author of &ldquo;The Great American Jobs Scam: Corporate Tax Dodging and the Myth of Job Creation,&rdquo; who will discuss the ills of corporate tax breaks in the name of &ldquo;economic development.&rdquo; </P><P>The site can be accessed at <A href="http://www.aflcio.org/blog">http://www.aflcio.org/blog</A>.</P><!-- #EndEditable -->
