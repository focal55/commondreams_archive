<p>WASHINGTON - March 8 - Two activists were arrested tonight after disrupting the hearing of the House Appropriations Committee. The Committee is considering approving nearly $65 billion in supplemental spending to fund the war in Iraq. The two
were arrested as they read the names of Iraqi citizens and U.S. soldiers who have died in this war. The action was part of the "Winter of Our Discontent" campaign organized by Voices for Creative Nonviolence. Waiting outside the doors were supporting members from Voices for Creative Nonviolence and the general public who could not gain access to the full Committee because the hearing room was packed by House members and their staff.
 
<p>"We act today to stop the death and suffering this war is causing in Iraq, and to urge others in the peace movement to raise the ante," said Mike Ferner, a member of Veterans for Peace and Voices for Creative Nonviolence. "Over 2300 U.S. soldiers and well over 100,000 Iraqi citizens have died in this war. It is time to end the occupation; bring our troops home; and pay so Iraqis can rebuild their country after 15 years of brutal economic and military warfare waged by the U.S."
 
<p>Since February 15, VCNV members have participated in a liquids-only fast and vigil at the U.S. Capitol. Four have gone without food as an act of solidarity with Iraqi citizens and as a call to the U.S. government and citizens to end the war against Iraq. This is the second action of civil resistance carried out during the Winter of Our Discontent campaign. The first occurred on February 27 in which 7 people were arrested at the White House.
 
<p>Key demands of the campaign include: 1) an immediate end to the U.S. occupation of Iraq; 2) full funding of the reconstruction of Iraq by the U.S.; 3) cancellation of the odious debt incurred by Saddam Hussein’s regime, without any International Monetary Fund conditions; and 4) cancellation of the war reparations charges imposed against Iraq by the U.N. for Hussein’s invasion and occupation of Kuwait in 1990-91.
 
<p>Currently in custody are Mike Ferner, member of Veterans for Peace, and Ed Kinane. Both are members of Voices For Creative Non-Violence (VCNV).
