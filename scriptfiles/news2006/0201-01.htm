<p>MOSCOW - February 1 - Greenpeace activists protested at the headquarters of a Russian 
government agency today, accusing it of trying to silence its own 
environmental experts who are opposed to plans for the world's biggest 
oil pipeline, scheduled to be built through a World Heritage Site around 
Lake Baikal.

<p>Over 80% of the experts, commissioned to assess the environmental impact 
of building the 4,200 km pipeline, rejected the proposal because of its 
proximity to one of the world's most fragile ecosystems, Lake Baikal - 
which has been a World Heritage Site since 1996.

<p>The environmental impact assessment (EIA) of the proposed pipeline was 
commissioned by Russia's Federal Service for Ecological, Technological 
and Atomic Supervision in November 2005. The agency convened a panel of 
52 top Russian scientists, who delivered their assessment on 24th 
January 2006. 43 out 52 of them signed a statement concluding that the 
pipeline would have a negative impact, highlighting that it would be 
built just 800 metres away from Lake Baikal, and poses "a great 
potential danger to the lake".

<p>Following these conclusions, the agency was expected to issue a special 
decree endorsing the results of the assessment, and blocking 
construction of the pipeline. However, the agency has failed to publish 
the decree and a number of the scientists on the panel have now 
complained that they have been pressured into changing their mind and 
approving an immediate start to construction.

 <p>"We are receiving phone calls asking to think twice before going public 
with the outcome of our work. In the meantime, the Federal Service is 
using loopholes in the Russian legislation to block the negative 
conclusions", said one of the experts.

<p>Experts claim that the agency is now recruiting more scientists in a bid 
to change the conclusions of the panel. Speaking at a Greenpeace press 
conference, one expert said  "Issuing a decree approving the EIA is just 
a bureaucratic formality, and the law does not bind the Federal Service 
to sign it. However, it says the Federal Service can hire additional 
experts to reach a decision, this time in favour of Transneft, while 
blocking the negative conclusion".

<p>The so-called 'Pacific Pipeline' developed and promoted by the Russian 
state-owned oil transport monopoly Transneft is going to become the 
largest pipeline project in the world. With its total length of 4,200 
kilometers, annual capacity of 80 million tons of oil and the total cost 
of up to 18 billion US dollars, the pipeline is three times as long and 
the Alyeska pipeline in the United States.

<p>Roman Vazhenkov, Lake Baikal Campaign Coordinator of Greenpeace 
commented "We want to show our support to all experts who are not giving 
in to the pressure and urge the Federal Service to approve the negative 
conclusions of the state EIA signed already by the overwhelming majority 
of the experts. At stake is Lake Baikal and the future of Russia as a 
civilized country".

<p>Under existing legislation, the deadline for the agency to issue the 
decree is February 3rd, 2006, but sources within the Federal Service say 
that the approval process may not be completed until April.
