<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON - October 5 - Global 
warming is the single greatest challenge threatening the National Wildlife 
Refuge System as a whole, according to a Defenders of Wildlife report that 
identifies 10 refuges demonstrating the dire consequences from global warming.
</p>
</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Global warming is occurring rapidly 
and these climate changes pose serious threats to wildlife and habitat,&quot;s tated 
Rodger Schlickeisen, president of Defenders of Wildlife. &quot;These changes can be 
seen throughout the National Wildlife Refuge System, which provides stark 
real-world examples of the effects of global warming today.&quot;</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">The report, &quot;<b><a href="http://www.defenders.org/habitat/refuges/refugesatrisk2006/refugesatrisk06.final.pdf">Refuges 
at Risk, The Threat of Global Warming</a></b>,&quot; is part of an annual assessment 
Defenders of Wildlife releases to gauge the state of the refuge system. </font>
</p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;While this report focuses on the 10 
most threatened refuges, the entire refuge system faces an uncertain future 
given the progress of global warming,&quot; said Schlickeisen. &quot;To fulfill its 
wildlife conservation mission, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service must take 
immediate steps to deal with the impacts of global warming.&quot;</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">The National Wildlife Refuge System 
was established by President Theodore Roosevelt in 1903 and now includes 545 
refuges encompassing nearly 100 million acres. It is the largest network of 
lands in the world dedicated first and foremost to the protection of wildlife 
and habitat. Refuges support a rich spectrum of ecosystems and provide crucial 
habitat for more than 280 threatened and endangered plants and animals. </font>
</p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Next week is National Wildlife 
Refuge Week, a time to celebrate and experience the beauty and wonders of these 
remarkable lands. Ninety-eight percent of all refuge lands are open to the 
public, drawing almost 40 million Americans annually to enjoy their natural 
wonders.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;This incredible system serves as 
the cornerstone of wildlife conservation in America. Arctic tundra, Sonoran 
desert, coral reefs and diverse wetlands throughout the refuge system safeguard 
millions of migratory birds and hundreds of endangered species while also 
providing unparalleled recreational opportunities for millions of people each 
year,&quot;stated Schlickeisen. &quot;We should be doing all we can to take the necessary, 
proactive steps to adapt to the change brought about by global warming while 
protecting the refuge system.&quot;</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Reducing the impacts of global 
warming on national wildlife refuges and other critical wildlife habitat 
requires a two-pronged approach: reducing greenhouse gas emissions and planning 
for a changing future. We have the ingenuity to minimize the potential impacts 
of global warming. We also have to adapt to whatever obstacles global warming 
creates, however, while carrying out the nation's mission to protect our 
wildlife refuges,&quot; added Schlickeisen. &quot;We cannot sit by and watch the only 
public lands devoted to wildlife protection wither away. There's simply too much 
at stake -- not only for us but for future generations.&quot;</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">The report offers several ways that 
the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service can address the threat that global warming 
poses to the refuge system. It suggests that the Service expand partnerships 
with businesses seeking credits for carbon sequestration, conserving energy and 
reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Most importantly, the report recommends the 
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service begin considering the implications of global 

warming in its long-range conservation planning for each refuge. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 
is hampered in its ability to manage the refuge system due to enormous funding 
gaps. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;The refuge system faces a huge 
budget shortfall that prevents the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service from 
adequately managing and restoring wildlife habitat, safely maintaining 
facilities and providing quality education and outdoor recreation programs for 
millions of visitors each year,&quot; added Schlickeisen.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Defenders of Wildlife works with 
federal, tribal, state and local agencies, private organizations and landowners 
to protect America's national wildlife refuges. The goal of the Refuges at Risk 
report is to highlight the threats facing the wildlife refuge system in order to 
build public support for saving wildlife by safeguarding and nourishing the 
places where they live. </font></p>
<p align="center"><b><font face="Arial" size="2">Top 10 Refuges At Risk of Global 
Warming<br>
(in alphabetical order)</font></b></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Alligator River NWR, NC --</b> Home to 
endangered red wolves, the low-lying nature of the refuge constitutes its 
greatest vulnerability to global warming. The rise in sea level that is expected 
in the next century from global warming would inundate much of the refuge.
</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Aransas NWR, TX --</b> The refuge 
protects the world's only wild population of endangered whooping cranes. Since 
the refuge is composed of low-lying coastal land with shallow estuarine marshes, 
the predicted rise in sea level from global warming would flood the marsh, erode 
beaches and possibly increase the salinity of rivers and groundwater.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Arctic NWR, AK --</b> The largest refuge 
in the country, the Arctic refuge is the most important onshore denning area for 
polar bears in the United States. Over the past century, the average temperature 
of the Arctic has increased by 4 to 7 degrees Fahrenheit. Sea ice is melting and 
permafrost is thawing, interfering with the migration of wildlife. </font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Chincoteague NWR, VA -- </b>While this 
barrier island has always experienced slow geologic change from ocean currents 
and weather, the pace of change is quickening due to global warming. If sea 
levels rise rapidly as predicted, wildlife habitat, as well as roads and 
facilities, on the refuge will be overwhelmed.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Devil Lakes Wetland Management 
District, ND --</b> A waterfowl haven, this refuge is threatened by a projected 
increase in the frequency and severity of droughts due to global warming. The 
number of breeding ducks in the prairie pothole region could be cut in half.
</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Hawaiian Islands NWR, HI</b> <b>--</b> Warmer 
sea temperatures, shifting currents, rising sea levels and sinking habitat are 
harming wildlife such as monk seals, seabirds and coral on this remote island 
chain. Scientists believe if this warming trend continues, many species of coral 
will go extinct.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Kenai NWR, AK</b> <b>--</b> Known as "Little 
Alaska," this refuge is threatened by retreating glaciers, frequent forest 
fires, dry lakebeds and loss of lush wildlife habitat caused by global warming. 
Wetlands and ponds are drying up and lake levels are dropping. Invasive beetles, 
spurred by warmer temperatures, have devastated forests, severely damaging 
wildlife habitat. </font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Merritt Island NWR, FL</b> <b>--</b> This 
gateway to the Kennedy Space Center is also home to 17 endangered and threatened 
species. As sea levels rise, this refuge's marshlands and a portion of its 
uplands will be inundated. Moreover, a higher water temperature contributes to 
an increase in toxic algal blooms which kill manatees and other sea life.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Oregon Islands NWR, OR</b> <b>--</b> Just last 
year a radically different weather pattern during the breeding season of 1.2 
million seabirds disrupted offshore currents and damaged the food chain, 
resulting in the largest ever die-off of the common murre, the refuge's most 
populous seabird resident. Similar events are expected in the future, rippling 
through the food chain.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Silvio O. Conte NWR, MA</b> <b>--</b> Projected 
rises in global temperatures of 2 to 10 degrees Fahrenheit may change the very 
nature of this refuge as well as the New England countryside. With projections 
that tree species will likely shift north by 200 miles, some wildlife species 
may not be able to adapt or migrate with the forest habitat. Earlier snow melts 
will lead to reduced stream flows and lowered oxygen levels by late summer, 
threatening the endangered shortnose sturgeon. </font></p>
