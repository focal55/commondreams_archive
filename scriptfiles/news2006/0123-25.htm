<p>SAN FRANCISCO - January 23 -  Despite the bad news that's featured every day on the front pages of the newspaper, there are positive changes happening in every corner of the globe! In Afghanistan, women have become judges, and NGOs are opening up more and more schools for girls. In Venezuela, a national literacy campaign is teaching more than one million adults to read and write for the first time. In Bolivia, a grassroots group of citizens Cochabamba successfully stopped the privatization of their city's water supply, which would have made water more expensive than the average Bolivian's monthly wage. In Nicaragua and Guatemala, farmers are increasing their family incomes and helping the environment by becoming "Fair Trade" certified coffee producers. In Viet Nam, the Women's Union is ensuring that rural Vietnamese families are included in the country's economic boom through extensive micro-lending programs.
<p>
These are just a few examples of the inspiring social changes that are highlighted on upcoming Global Exchange Reality Tours. Global Exchange has been offering socially responsible Reality Tours since 1989, to provide travelers with an in-depth understanding of countries and cultures by connecting them with inspiring community organizers and social change advocates around the globe.
