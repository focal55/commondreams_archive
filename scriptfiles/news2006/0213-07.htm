<p>NEW YORK - February 13 - For the first time ever,  eight of the world's top jewelry retailers have pledged to move  away from &quot;dirty&quot; gold sales and are calling on mining  corporations to ensure that gold is produced in more socially and  environmentally responsible ways. The retailers, which are the  Zale Corp., the Signet Group (the parent firm of Sterling and Kay  Jewelers), Tiffany &amp; Co., Helzberg Diamonds, Fortunoff, Cartier,  Piaget, and Van Cleef &amp; Arpels, are being praised by the No Dirty  Gold campaign today in a full-page ad in The New York Times,  timed to coincide with Valentine's Day, one of the biggest  jewelry-buying holidays in the United States. </p>
<p>   &quot;Because jewelry retailers buy the majority of gold produced  worldwide, they have the power to help clean up the mining  industry,&quot; said Payal Sampat, co-director of the No Dirty Gold  campaign and international campaign director for EARTHWORKS. &quot;We  applaud the leadership of these companies. It's an important  first step.&quot;</p>
<p>   More than 80 percent of the gold produced worldwide is used to  make jewelry. Retail sales of jewelry in the U.S. alone surpassed  $45 billion in 2004, of which gold jewelry accounted for $17  billion.  The eight companies identified as &quot;leaders&quot; together  represent $6.3 billion in retail jewelry sales, or 14 percent of  sales in the United States, which is second only to India in  annual gold consumption.  Four of the top 10 U.S. jewelry  firms -- Zales, Kay Jewelers (Sterling/Signet), Tiffany &amp; Co.,  and Helzberg Diamonds -- are among the firms identified as  &quot;leaders.&quot;</p>
<p>   The New York Times ad ( available at  <a href="http://releases.usnewswire.com/redir.asp?ReleaseID=60882&Link=http://www.nodirtygold.org">http://www.nodirtygold.org</a> ) features a heart-shaped locket with  images depicting the environmental and human toll of gold mining,  and the headline &quot;There's nothing romantic about a toxic gold  mine.&quot; The ad then names both the retail jewelry &quot;leaders,&quot; that  have made in-principle commitments to sourcing more responsibly  produced gold and those &quot;laggard&quot; companies that have not yet  done so.  The &quot;laggard&quot; retailers identified by the campaign are  Rolex, JCPenney, Wal-Mart, Fred Meyer Jewelers, Whitehall  Jewellers, Jostens, QVC, and Sears/Kmart.</p>
<p>   &quot;Despite growing demand from concerned consumers, mining  corporations have yet to significantly reduce the harm their  operations are inflicting on communities in many parts of the  world,&quot; said Keith Slack, co-director of the No Dirty Gold  campaign and senior policy advisor for Oxfam America. &quot;When major  jewelry retailers demand ethically produced gold for their  products, it's time for the mining industry to take note and make  changes in their practices.&quot;</p>
<p>   Growing controversy over new mine proposals and news stories  detailing environmental and human rights abuses and corruption  within the gold mining industry have prompted retailers to worry  about their brand reputations and have spurred consumers to  question the source of their gold purchases.  Since the No Dirty  Gold campaign was launched two years ago, more than 30,000  consumers have signed a petition urging mining corporations to  clean up their act and produce gold more responsibly.</p>
<p>   The jewelry industry &quot;leaders&quot; named by the No Dirty Gold  campaign have endorsed human rights, environmental, and social  justice principles that call for responsible practices in  producing gold and precious metals. These include: </p>
<p>   (1) Respect for basic human rights outlined in international  conventions and law;  </p>
<p>   (2) Free, prior, and informed consent from affected  communities;  </p>
<p>   (3) Respect for workers' rights and labor standards; </p>
<p>   (4) Protecting parks and natural reserves from mining; and,</p>
<p>   (5) Protecting oceans, rivers, lakes, and streams from mining  wastes. </p>
<p>   The production of a single gold ring generates, on average, 20  tons of waste. Gold mining has caused massive environmental  destruction, contaminated fisheries and fresh water used for  drinking and irrigation, and displaced tens of thousands of rural  farming, fishing, and ranching communities. </p>
<p>   &quot;For too long, the people who are buying and selling gold have  been blind to mining's impacts on the water, the air, the land,  and communities like the Western Shoshone. What we're talking  about is the life of future generations -- and not just Indian  children, but all children,&quot; said Carrie Dann of the Western  Shoshone Defense Project. &quot;But today, some of the leading jewelry  retailers are recognizing that they have a responsibility not  only to their customers but also to communities affected by gold  mining.&quot; Approximately half the gold produced worldwide between  1995 and 2015 has or will come from indigenous peoples' lands.  </p>
<p>   The No Dirty Gold campaign is not a boycott on gold, but is  working to end destructive mining practices, educate consumers  about gold mining's impacts and build consumer support for  industry reform.  </p>
