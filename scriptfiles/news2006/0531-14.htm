<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --> BOSTON - May 31 - Health advocates across the globe are marking World No Tobacco Day by raising awareness of the harmful effects of all tobacco products, and urging governments to ratify and implement the global tobacco treaty. Formally known as the World Health Organization (WHO) Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, the treaty aims to reverse the global tobacco epidemic with provisions that include a ban on tobacco advertising, promotion and sponsorship. The treaty also protects public health policies from tobacco industry interference. According to the WHO, the treaty is projected to save 200 million lives by 2050, and has been ratified by 128 countries. </P>
<P>&nbsp;"As we mark World No Tobacco Day this year, nearly 75% of the world's population lives in countries that have ratified the global tobacco treaty," said Corporate Accountability International Executive Director Kathryn Mulvey. "Despite tremendous progress, the challenge to Big Tobacco remains urgent as corporations like Philip Morris/Altria and British American Tobacco devise new approaches to addict young people to their deadly products."</P>
<P>The WHO's theme for this year's World No Tobacco Day is, "Tobacco: Deadly in any form or disguise." According to Corporate Accountability International, this topic couldn't have been more timely, as corporations like Philip Morris/Altria persist in attempts to undermine the treaty's implementation.</P>
<P>In Nigeria, Kenya, Zambia, other countries across Africa, and around the world, members of the Network for Accountability of Tobacco Transnationals (NATT) are organizing events to mark World No Tobacco Day. African nations led the way toward a strong global tobacco treaty, and already 27 African countries have ratified. </P>
<P>"Through the negotiations and adoption of the tobacco treaty, Africa was a leader on the global stage in fighting for tobacco control," said Muyunda Ililonga of Zambia Consumers Association. "We are challenging countries like Zambia that have not yet ratified the treaty to do so swiftly, and all countries to implement the treaty's provisions promptly, in order to save millions of lives."</P>
<P>The United States is among a dwindling minority of countries that has not ratified the global tobacco treaty. As of this week, the global tobacco treaty has been stalled in the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee for two years. The treaty was signed with great fanfare by the Bush Administration during Bush's campaign for re-election in May of 2004. Today, while corporate accountability groups around the world are celebrating World No Tobacco Day and commending governments for moving forward with implementation of this groundbreaking treaty, Corporate Accountability International's members across the U.S. are calling on the Bush Administration to bring the treaty before the Senate for a vote. </P>
<P>"As the world moves ahead with effective tobacco control measures, regulation of all tobacco products is an important ingredient," said Yul Francisco Dorado, Corporate Accountability International Latin America Coordinator. "While the tobacco industry seeks to derail tobacco control policies, health officials must remain vigilant and resist interference of tobacco corporations."</P>
