<p>NEW YORK  - February 24 - Today, Tamara Draut, Director of the Economic 
      Opportunity Program at public policy group Demos, released the following 
      statement responding to the new report from the Federal Reserve bank based 
      on their triennial Survey of Consumer Finances: 
<P>"This report confirms what our research has shown over the years&#8212;that 
      growing numbers of American households face mounting debt and financial 
      instability. Every American should be able to achieve middle class 
      economic security, a hallmark of national and household stability in this 
      country. But the Federal Reserve's findings spotlight trends that are 
      causing economic fragility in today's middle class and are closing the 
      door on low-income Americans that are trying to reach it. </P>
      <P>"Several key indicators jump out of the new report: Over 76 percent of 
      households carry debt, up since 2001. Of households in debt, the median 
      amount of debt, $55,300, is a staggering 128 percent of the median US 
      household income. A greater number of people reported not saving money in 
      2004 than in 2001; only 41 percent save regularly. That's a foreboding 
      number for a nation with 76 million people reaching retirement age over 
      the next 25 years.</P>
      <P>"The report also shows that some populations are having more difficulty 
      with debt than others. Findings show that more seniors are carrying debt: 
      in the three years from 2001 to 2004, the percentage of households over 
      age 75 holding debt increased by 11 percentage points, from 29 percent to 
      40 percent.</P>
      <P>"The Federal Reserve numbers also show that credit card debt is quickly 
      piling up for many Americans. According to the report, mean credit card 
      debt is up 15.9 percent; median is up 10 percent. And the middle class, 
      defined by the Federal Reserve as the fifth of the population with $42,500 
      median income, took on more credit card debt in recent year over any other 
      demographic. Recent Demos research has shown why: Stagnant wages mixed 
      with skyrocketing healthcare, education and housing costs, plus greater 
      job instability has pushed America's families right to the limit, and 
      they're borrowing on high-cost credit just to make ends meet.</P>
      <P>"Home equity loans in particular became more common in those three 
      years. Many people are using the cash-out refinancing to pay down their 
      credit card debts and to cover expenses that income can't meet. This trend 
      in using equity to consolidate debts was also evident in the report&#8212;30 
      percent cited doing so with a median balance of home secured debt at 
      $22,000, up from $16,000 in 2001. The message is clear: Americans are 
      keeping their families afloat by putting their greatest asset at risk. 
</P>
      <P>"This report is a clarion for the American people, and our elected 
      leaders, that we must support policies&#8212;the essential structures that 
      bolster a fair and opportunity-rich economy&#8212;that reverse this trend and 
      create a secure financial future for America in the 21st Century."</P>
