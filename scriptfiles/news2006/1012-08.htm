<p>WASHINGTON - October 12 - Democracy 21 and the  Campaign Legal Center today filed a complaint with the Federal  Election Commission (FEC) charging that the Economic Freedom Fund  (EFF), a pro-Republican 527 group, and Majority Action, a pro- Democratic 527 group, are spending soft money to influence the  2006 congressional elections in violation of the federal campaign  finance laws.</p>
<p>   According to the FEC complaint, longstanding federal campaign  finance laws and Supreme Court decisions, including the McConnell  decision, make clear that 527 groups spending money to influence  federal elections are required to register as federal political  committees and comply with federal campaign finance laws,  including limits on the contributions they receive.</p>
<p>   Despite these requirements, 527 groups have improperly spent  large amounts of soft money to influence the 2004 presidential  elections and are now improperly spending millions of dollars of  soft money to influence the 2006 congressional elections, the  complaint states.</p>
<p>   &quot;The failure of the FEC to require 527 groups to comply with  federal campaign finance laws has resulted in blatant, flagrant  circumvention of the campaign finance laws by 527 groups in the  2004 and 2006 federal elections,&quot; according to Democracy 21  President Fred Wertheimer.</p>
<p>   &quot;The complaint our groups have filed today continues our  battle to force the FEC to do its job and properly enforce the  campaign finance laws against 527 groups, which are wrongly  injecting tens of millions of dollars in unlimited soft money  into federal races,&quot; Wertheimer said. &quot;We are committed to  working at the FEC, in the courts and in Congress to end the soft  money abuses of 527 groups in time for the 2008 presidential and  congressional elections.&quot;</p>
<p>   &quot;The Commission has proven incapable of resolving the 527  issue on a case by case basis, or worse simply unwilling to do  so,&quot; said J. Gerald Hebert, Executive Director of the Campaign  Legal Center. &quot;All but one of the complaints filed from the 2004  election cycle are still pending.&quot;</p>
<p>   &quot;Another election season is upon us and, tragically for our  democracy, the FEC has once again failed to act to reign in  abuses by 527 groups,&quot; Hebert added. &quot;The Commission has ignored  Congressional intent and scathing rebukes by the courts, but the  FEC's failures to date do not mean that the law can be violated  with impunity indefinitely.&quot;</p>
<p>   The complaint states that EFF and Majority Action have as  their major purpose influencing federal elections, have raised  and spent substantial sums to influence federal elections, and  therefore are required to register as federal political  committees and comply with federal campaign finance laws, which  they have not done.</p>
<p>   In 2004, Democracy 21, the Campaign Legal Center and the  Center for Responsive Politics filed a number of similar  complaints with the FEC against six 527 groups spending soft  money to influence the presidential election. More than two years  later, the FEC still has not taken any public action on the  pending complaints regarding five of the 527 groups. The  complaint against the sixth 527 group was dismissed by the FEC  this year on the ground that the group ended up not running any  ads. (All of the complaints can be found at www.democracy21.org)</p>
<p>   According to the complaint, reports filed with the IRS show  that EEF was established on August 1, 2006. Reports filed with  the FEC show that, as of October 9, 2006, EFF has raised at least  $5,050,225, with $5 million coming from just one single donor,  Bob Perry, the complaint states.</p>
<p>   In the 2004 elections, Perry donated $4.45 million to Swift  Boat Veterans for Truth and $3 million to Progress for America  Voter Fund, two pro-Republican 527 groups that spent large  amounts of soft money to defeat Democratic Presidential nominee  John Kerry and re-elect President Bush, the complaint states.</p>
<p>   According to the complaint, reports filed with the FEC show  that, as of October 9, 2006, EEF has spent at least $2,120,893  during the 2006 congressional elections. The group has funded TV  ads, direct mailings and other communications attacking  Representatives Allan Mollohan (D-WV), Jim Marshall (D-GA), John  Barrow (D-GA), Leonard Boswell (D-IA), Darlene Hooley (D-OR) and  Baron Hill (D-IN).</p>
<p>   According to the complaint, Majority Action was established on  July 12, 2005, and has filed reports with the IRS and the FEC  showing that, as of October 6, 2006, the group has raised at  least $1,382,250 and has spent at least $384,816. The  contributions to the group include $500,000 from Adam Rove,  $170,000 from George Soros, $100,000 from John Hunting, $100,000  from Linda Pritzger, $150,000 from SEIU entities and $50,000 from  the American Federation of Teachers.</p>
<p>   The complaint notes that according to a press release issued  by Majority Action, &quot;Majority Action is led by veteran Democratic  campaign operatives and has a leadership board that consists of  prominent political figures, including several former Members of  Congress, two former Democratic National Committee Chairmen and  two former DCCC Chairmen.&quot;</p>
<p>   The complaint also notes that an article in the Washington  Post (September 7, 2006) stated that &quot;(Majority Action co- chairman Joe) Andrew said Majority Action has a 'seven-figure'  budget -- between $8 million and $10 million, an informed source  said -- and was spending in the 'six figures' in individual House  districts,&quot; according to the complaint.</p>
<p>   The complaint states that according to information found in  Majority Action's press releases and on its Web site, Majority  Action has funded ads attacking House Speaker Dennis Hastert (R- IL), and Representatives James Walsh (R-NY), Deborah Pryce (R- OH), Dave Reichert (R-WA), Thomas Reynolds (R-NY), Chris Chocola  (R-IN), Thelma Drake (R-VA) and Don Sherwood (R-PA).</p>
<p>   As in previous FEC complaints they have filed against 527  groups, Democracy 21 and the Campaign Legal Center noted in the  complaint the role played by the FEC in the past in subverting  the nation's campaign finance laws. The complaint noted the  Supreme Court decision in McConnell which found that FEC  regulations had been responsible for establishing the soft money  system, and had &quot;subverted&quot; and &quot;invited widespread  circumvention&quot; of the Federal Election Campaign Act.</p>
<p>   In September 2004, Representatives Christopher Shays (R-CT)  and Marty Meehan (D-MA) filed a lawsuit challenging the FEC for  its failure to issue regulations to require 527 groups to comply  with the campaign finance laws. The FEC responded to the lawsuit  by stating it had decided to enforce the laws against 527 groups  by using case-by-case adjudication rather than by issuing  regulations on 527 groups.</p>
<p>   On March 29, 2006, Judge Emmett Sullivan of the federal  district court in Washington, D.C. ruled that the FEC had &quot;failed  to present a reasoned explanation&quot; for its decision to terminate  its rulemaking on 527 groups without issuing any new regulation  on such groups. Judge Sullivan found that &quot;judging from FEC's  track record in the 2004 election, case-by-case adjudication  appears to have been a total failure.&quot;</p>
<p>   Judge Sullivan remanded the case back to the FEC and ordered  the agency either to articulate a more persuasive case for  enforcing the laws against 527 groups on case-by-case  adjudication or to promulgate new regulations for 527 groups.</p>
<p>   After the FEC failed to respond to the court order for more  than six months, Representatives Shays and Meehan filed a motion  with Judge Sullivan on September 13, 2006 and asked the court to  set a deadline for the FEC to comply with the court's order.  Judge Sullivan has scheduled a hearing on the motion for November  2, 2006.</p>
