<p>WASHINGTON - January 24 - Nancy Keenan, president of NARAL Pro-Choice America, issued the following statement in response to today’s 10-8 Senate Judiciary Committee vote in favor of Samuel Alito’s confirmation to the Supreme Court. 
<p>"The eight members of the Senate Judiciary Committee who opposed Samuel Alito's nomination stood up for the American values of freedom and privacy. We hope their colleagues follow their lead as the full Senate now considers whether to confirm Alito for a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court. For senators who value privacy and freedom, the only option is to vote no.

<p>"The threat Alito poses to the core principles of Roe v. Wade was further underscored yesterday when anti-choice groups from across the country converged on Washington, DC to celebrate the prospect of his replacing Justice Sandra Day O'Connor on the Supreme Court. They have long sought to dismantle and eventually overturn Roe, and now they see a nominee who will help them achieve this goal. Americans are counting on the U.S. Senate to stop this nomination and protect the constitutional freedoms that Roe v. Wade embodies."
