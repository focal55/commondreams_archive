<p>WASHINGTON - June 8 - Congress is expected to  vote today on an amendment to the Foreign Operations  Appropriations bill that would cut funding to the notorious  Western Hemisphere Institute for Security Cooperation, formerly  known as the School of the Americas (SOA/WHINSEC). The amendment  will be offered by Reps. Jim McGovern (D-MA) and John Lewis (D- GA).</p>
<p>   &quot;Today Congress is presented with a crucial opportunity to  send a message of support for human rights to not only Latin  America, but the world,&quot; said Rev. Roy Bourgeois, a Maryknoll  priest and founder of School of the Americas Watch (SOA Watch),  the grassroots organization dedicated to researching the  SOA/WHINSEC and educating the public about the school.</p>
<p>   Citing concerns about torture, foreign military training and  Pentagon accountability, constituents from hundreds of  Congressional districts traveled to Capitol Hill in April to  participate in lobbying efforts to cut funding to the School of  the Americas, a military training facility for Latin American  security personnel located at Fort Benning, Georgia. As a result  of constituent support, 133 bipartisan members of the House co- sponsor HR 1217, legislation that would suspend operations at  WHINSEC.</p>
<p>   Support for the School of the Americas, now called the Western  Hemisphere Institute for Security Cooperation, continues to  erode. In March, two South American countries sent a strong  message of support for human rights and military accountability  by ceasing all military training of their troops at the  controversial U.S. Army's School of the Americas. Citing concerns  around the image of the institution in Latin America, Argentina  and Uruguay announced that they would no longer send soldiers to  train at the military school based at Fort Benning.</p>
<p>   The SOA/ WHINSEC catapulted into the headlines in 1996 when  the Pentagon released training manuals used at the school that  advocated torture, extortion and execution. Despite this shocking  admission and hundreds of documented human rights abuses  connected to soldiers trained at the school, no independent  investigation into the training facility has ever taken place.</p>
<p>   Since 1996, Congress has debated several times whether to cut  funding for the institution. The amendment that will be offered  to HR 5522, the Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related  Programs Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2007, has broad  bipartisan support. A close vote is expected.</p>
