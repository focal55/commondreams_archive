<p>WASHINGTON - February 23 - The federal government  has not done enough to meet the housing needs of poor residents  affected by the 2005 hurricanes, according to a new analysis from  the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, which also details  several policy recommendations for Congress in this area.</p>
<p>   &quot;The rebuilding from the hurricanes has only begun,&quot; said Will  Fischer, the report's primary author.  &quot;But the course that has  been charted to date indicates that many low-income hurricane  victims will not be provided the means to return home and secure  housing that they can afford.&quot;</p>
<p>   The storms' immediate devastation displaced rich and poor  alike, the report explains, but higher-income households are much  better equipped than lower-income households to rebuild their  lives because they are much more likely to have insurance,  significant non-housing assets, and the ability to obtain private  loans.  The federal government has done little to address the  serious problems that low-income households face in these areas.</p>
<p>   On February 16, the Administration requested $19.8 billion in  supplemental funding for hurricane relief.  The Center's analysis  finds that, while this request would provide some additional  funding to meet housing needs, neither the supplemental request  nor the Administration's new 2007 budget will be sufficient to  fill fully the gaps in housing assistance to low-income  residents.  The problems are not limited to resource levels, the  report finds, and stem to a significant degree from basic  shortcomings with some of the approaches the federal government  is taking to these problems.</p>
<p>   The report recommends that Congress take the following steps:</p>
<p>   -- Have HUD, not FEMA, provide continuing rental assistance to  disaster victims.  After Hurricane Katrina struck, the federal  government established two separate rental assistance programs  for displaced families.  Both programs have suffered from  confusion over who should be assisted and how.  In December,  Congress folded one of these programs (HUD's Katrina Disaster  Housing Assistance Program) into Section 8, HUD's regular housing  voucher program, which has the benefit of clear, tested rules.   Congress should do the same for the other new program, which is  operated by FEMA.</p>
<p>   That program will exhaust its current funding this spring, and  the Administration now has requested an additional $9.4 billion for  FEMA's disaster relief fund, in part to continue providing  housing assistance to victims of the 2005 Gulf hurricanes.   (Displaced families may receive rental assistance for up to 18  months.)  Congress should not simply provide the requested funds;  it should accompany the funds with a revamping of the FEMA  housing assistance program, including its incorporation into  Section 8 and its transfer to HUD.  The FEMA housing assistance  program has been beset by serious management problems throughout  the period since the hurricanes hit.  Particularly for families  that need assistance beyond the three months that FEMA's initial  rental assistance checks are designed to cover, housing Assistance should be provided under Section 8 rules and the  necessary funds should be transferred from FEMA to HUD.</p>
<p>   -- Help owners repair easily fixed apartments in the disaster  area. FEMA's primary strategy for making housing available in  damaged areas has been to install trailers.  This has occurred at  an extremely slow ace - in New Orleans, only 3,000 trailers  reportedly had been installed y early February out of 21,000  requested.</p>
<p>   Estimates indicate that about 20,000 vacant apartments in New  Orleans hat cannot be occupied today could be made habitable with  relatively modest repairs.  Because nearly half a year has  elapsed since the hurricanes hit and these repairs have not been  made (despite the much higher rents that now prevail in the  area), it is likely that many of the owners of these rental  properties are having difficulty obtaining the needed funds.  The  federal government should provide owners with loans, loan  guarantees, or grants to enable them to make these repairs. In  return, the owners would agree to make units available to  displaced families for at least the usual 18-month period for  which FEMA housing assistance can be provided to such families.   To carry out the initiative most efficiently, funds should be  transferred from FEMA's disaster relief fund for distribution  through HUD's existing HOME program in areas that are continuing  to experience severe housing shortages.</p>
<p>   -- Restore the pre-hurricane supply of federally subsidized  housing. Much of the subsidized housing in the region hit by the  hurricanes was destroyed or severely damaged.  Not all of those  units should be rebuilt on their former sites, in part because  some of the former developments concentrated large numbers of  poor people in isolated locations with little access to jobs or  services.  But given the shortage of affordable housing in the  area, the total number of affordable units -- including housing  made affordable through subsidies to private owners as well as  public housing -- needs to be returned to the pre-hurricane  level.  Based on HUD estimates, at least $450 million will be  needed for this purpose, but the Administration asked for no  additional funding to meet this need in the recent supplemental  appropriation request or its fiscal year 2007 budget.</p>
<p>   A portion of the cost of replacing damaged public housing  could be covered through funds Congress has already provided for  HUD's HOPE VI program, without any added appropriation.  HOPE VI  is designed to promote the creation of mixed-income neighborhoods  by providing funding for the demolition and reconstruction of  seriously deteriorated public housing and could be readily used  to support restoration of public housing damaged by the  hurricanes.  The Administration's new budget calls, however, for  eliminating HOPE VI funding in 2007 and also for rescinding all  $99 million that Congress appropriated for the program in 2006.   Instead, these 2006 funds should be redirected to housing  agencies in the Gulf Coast region that can use the funds to  replace public housing damaged by the hurricanes and to provide  badly-needed housing units for poor families, elderly  individuals, and people with disabilities.</p>
<p>   -- Authorize additional housing vouchers to ensure that a  share of rebuilt private housing is affordable to poor  households.  The Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) was  created in 1986 to expand the supply of affordable private  housing units by providing financial incentives to developers to  build or rehabilitate housing that includes units affordable to  low- or moderate-income households.  In December 2005, Congress  authorized a large increase in the authority of the hurricane- damaged states to issue these tax credits.  The increase could  result in the construction or rehabilitation of about 54,000  rental units.</p>
<p>   These tax credits are usually insufficient by themselves to  reduce rents to the point where poor households can afford them.   An additional subsidy normally is required to bridge that gap,  and Section 8 housing vouchers are well suited to this purpose.   Accordingly, Congress should provide housing authorities on the  Gulf Coast with at least 13,500 additional &quot;project-based&quot;  housing vouchers to be assigned to housing units financed with  the new tax credits or to supportive housing units for people  with disabilities financed with other capital funds.  The 13,500  vouchers would enable 25 percent of the 54,000 rental units that  can be constructed with the tax credits to be made available to  poor families.  The initial cost of these vouchers --  approximately $100 million -- potentially could be met by setting  aside for this purpose a portion of an appropriation for Section  8 included by the Administration in its recent hurricane recovery  supplemental request.</p>
<p>   -- Help low-income homeowners repair or replace damaged homes.   The federal government is providing significant assistance to  owners of homes that were damaged by the hurricanes.  Much of  this assistance, however, is structured in a manner ill-suited to  assisting homeowners with low incomes.</p>
<p>   The Small Business Administration provides recovery loans of  up to $200,000 with reduced interest rates to homeowners.   Applicants qualify for the loans based on demonstrated ability to  repay them, and low-income households often have difficulty  meeting the repayment criteria.  The Gulf Coast states also plan  to use much of the $11.5 billion in Community Development Block  Grant funds under a supplemental appropriation passed in December  2005 to provide grants and loans to homeowners.  But,  particularly in Louisiana, these funds as well are likely to fall  well short of the need.</p>
<p>   The Administration recognizes that the CDBG funding Louisiana  is now slated to receive is inadequate and has proposed $4.2  billion in added CDBG funds for the state as part of the new  supplemental appropriation request.  Even with this added amount,  it is not certain from the available information that CDBG  funding would be adequate both to fill the gaps in homeowner  assistance and to meet additional needs for restoration of  severely damaged rental housing and other purposes.  (Few other  resources are available to meet these needs.)  The Administration's $4.2 billion request should be viewed as the  minimum needed to meet the most glaring gaps in available federal  resources.</p>
<p>   If these funds are not provided, many households -- and  particularly low-income households -- would not be able to  rebuild or replace their homes.  As a result, tens of thousands  of low-income, disproportionately African-American households  would be left with their primary asset destroyed and little means  of restoring it.</p>
