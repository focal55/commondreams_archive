<p>NEW YORK - January 25 - An independent human rights defender 
was badly beaten yesterday in Tashkent, Human Rights Watch said 
today. The beating appears to be the latest in a growing number of 
physical attacks on human rights defenders, and occurred on the eve of 
the trial of an Uzbek opposition leader. 

<p>The defender, Rakhmatullo Alibaev, told Human Rights Watch that 
yesterday at about 1:15 p.m. he was at the office of the opposition party 
Ozod Dekhon (Free Peasant Party) when there was a knock at the door. 
Alibaev opened the door to a man who identified himself as the brother 
of the party's chairwoman, Nigora Khidoiatova. The man walked in, 
began yelling at him, punched him three times in the face-in the nose 
and right cheek-and left.   
  
<p>The right side of Alibaev's face is now badly swollen, and his eye is 
swollen shut. A doctor found that he suffered a broken nose, a 
concussion, and trauma to the brain. Alibaev filed a complaint with the 
police through the doctor's office.   
  
<p>For several years, Alibaev has monitored trials of independent Muslims 
charged with religious extremism and assisted victims of economic 
fraud. He is also affiliated with Ozod Dekhon.   
  
<p>"Alibaev is yet another victim of the relentless assault on human rights 
defenders in Uzbekistan," said Holly Cartner, Europe and Central Asia 
director at Human Rights Watch. "This beating appears timed to send a 
message to those who might monitor today's trial."   
  
<p>While the identity of Alibaev's assailant is not known, Human Rights 
Watch said it was unlikely that the attack was the act of a private 
individual. The beating of human rights activists by unidentified men 
has escalated during recent weeks and is part of a fierce crackdown on 
civil society that has been underway since the May 13, 2005 massacre of 
unarmed demonstrators in Andijan.   
  
<p>In recent months, physical attacks on activists in Uzbekistan have tended 
to coincide with critical events, such as pickets, activists' meetings with 
the international community, or the opening of a trial.   
  
<p>Alibaev's beating happened the day before the scheduled start of the trial 
of Nodira Khidoiatova, coordinator of the opposition group Sunshine 
Coalition of Uzbekistan, and sister of Nigora Khidoiatova. She is 
charged under seven articles of the Uzbek Criminal Code, including 
robbery, extortion, plunder, embezzlement, and theft. The trial is to take 
place in the Tashkent City Court.   
  
<p>Another leader of the Sunshine Coalition, Sanjar Umarov, who is also a 
relative of the Khidoiatova sisters, will be put on trial next Monday. 
Umarov, a permanent resident of the United States, is also charged with 
embezzlement related to an oil company in which he formerly had an 
ownership interest.

<p>The charges against both Khidoiatova and Umarov appear to be 
politically motivated. Khidoiatova was arrested on December 18, 2005 
at the airport in Tashkent when she returned from a trip to Moscow, 
where in November she spoke at a press conference on tyranny in 
Uzbekistan. Umarov was arrested in October after returning to 
Uzbekistan from a visit to the United States and Russia, where he 
publicly discussed the Sunshine Coalition's ideas for economic reform. 
On October 17, Umarov wrote an open letter to Russian Foreign 
Minister Sergei Lavrov, in which he called for economic reforms in 
Uzbekistan and closer economic cooperation with Russia.   
  
<p>The Sunshine Coalition, established earlier this year, is made up of 
businessmen and academics and has close ties to Ozod Dekhon. The 
coalition openly criticizes Uzbek government policies and corruption.   
  
<p>"The Uzbek government has a long record of persecuting political 
opponents by bringing politically motivated charges against them," said 
Cartner. "Khidoiatova and Umarov are the latest victims."
