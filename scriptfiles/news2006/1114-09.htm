<p>WASHINGTON - November 14 - <p>This GLAAD resource document is also available at glaad.org:<br><a href="http://glaad.org/media/newspops_detail.php?id=3936">http://glaad.org/media/newspops_detail.php?id=3936</a>

World AIDS Day, the international event designed to strengthen global efforts in the fight against HIV and AIDS, will be observed on Friday, Dec. 1, 2006. In honor of this endeavor, many broadcast and cable networks will air special programming to further educate the public about the ongoing health crisis. This year is especially noteworthy as 2006 marks the pandemic's 25th year.</p>

"World AIDS Day is an important opportunity to remind people that this scourge of an epidemic is still a reality and a continuing threat for millions of people around the world," says Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD) President Neil G. Giuliano. "People with HIV and AIDS are often rendered invisible in media coverage, so this is a much-needed way to refocus media attention on HIV awareness and prevention strategies."</p>

Since 1981, an estimated 25 million worldwide - including more than 500,000 Americans - have died due to AIDS-related causes while 40 million are currently infected, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Approximately 40,000 Americans, many under the age of 25, still become infected with HIV every year. As a result, the CDC asserts, the only way to defeat HIV and AIDS is to reduce the number of people who become infected from the very beginning.  </p>

When AIDS was first revealed to be a major health crisis, the public was gripped by fear, much of it fed by erroneous and anti-gay media coverage. The Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD) was born in 1985 to protest this defamatory and sensational reporting.</p>
