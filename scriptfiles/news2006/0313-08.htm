<p>NEW YORK - March 13 - The American Civil Liberties Union today criticized the United 
States for violating the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights 
(ICCPR), a major human rights treaty the U.S. ratified in 1992.&nbsp; In remarks 
to the 86th Session of the United Nations Human Rights Committee, the ACLU 
called for a rigorous investigation into violations of the treaty.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
</P>
<P>&#8220;In the name of national security, the Bush administration has eroded the 
rule of law and the system of checks and balances in the United States, both 
fundamental principles in any democracy,&#8221; said Ann Beeson, Associate Legal 
Director of the ACLU, who presented today&#8217;s testimony. &#8220;In our America, we will 
not tolerate illegal spying or torture. The ACLU calls on the Human Rights 
committee to join us in our effort to hold the U.S. government 
accountable.&#8221;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>In a statement read today at the opening session of the Human Rights 
Committee, the ACLU said: &#8220;In the last four years we have witnessed serious 
setbacks in the protection of civil and political rights within the United 
States.&nbsp; The U.S. government has instituted a number of unbalanced and 
unchecked policies that clearly undermine fundamental rights and liberties long 
recognized and honored in our country.&nbsp; These policies affect a broad range 
of issues, including women&#8217;s rights, immigrants&#8217; rights, racial justice, 
national security and the freedom of religion and belief.&#8221;&nbsp; </P>
<P>The ACLU also provided details in its testimony about remaining flaws in the 
recently reauthorized Patriot Act and on the illegal National Security Agency 
spying program.&nbsp; <BR>&nbsp;<BR>&#8220;America cannot hold itself as a moral 
beacon to the world if it violates the rule of law by engaging in illegal 
spying, torture and secrecy,&#8221; said Jamil Dakwar, an attorney with the ACLU Human 
Rights Working Group. &#8220;The ACLU is committed to making sure that our government 
complies with universally recognized human rights principles and upholds our 
Constitution.&#8221;&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>Last October, the United States submitted its second and third periodic 
reports to the U.N. Human Rights Committee which oversees the implementation of 
the Covenant by the 152 signatory member states. The U.S. report was seven years 
overdue and did not include information on U.S. conformity with the Covenant 
overseas, claiming the treaty does not apply beyond U.S. soil and therefore is 
not applicable to U.S. military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan.&nbsp; </P>
<P>The full review session of the U.S. report by the 18 members of the Human 
Rights Committee will take place next July in Geneva. Meanwhile, at the end of 
its New York session the Committee will publish a list of questions and issues 
to be considered at the meeting in Geneva with representatives of the U.S. 
government. </P>
<P>The U.N. Human Rights Committee was established to monitor the implementation 
of the ICCPR. It is composed of 18 independent experts with recognized 
competence in the field of human rights. The Committee meets three times a year 
for sessions of three weeks' duration, normally in March at United Nations 
headquarters in New York and in July and November at the United Nations Office 
in Geneva.</P>
<P>The ACLU's new Human Rights Working Group is dedicated to holding the U.S. 
government accountable to universally recognized human rights principles. The 
Human Rights Working Group is charged with incorporating international human 
rights strategies into ACLU advocacy on issues relating to national security, 
immigrants' rights, women's rights and racial justice.</P>
<P>ACLU&#8217;s statement to the Human Rights Committee is available online at: <A class=noline_blue href="http://www.aclu.org/intlhumanrights/gen/24498leg20060313.html/">www.aclu.org/intlhumanrights/gen/24498leg20060313.html</A></P>
<P>In September 2005, the ACLU submitted a full list of issues of concern to the 
Human Rights Committee regarding counter-terrorism measures adopted by the 
United States.&nbsp; It is available online at <A class=noline_blue href="http://www.aclu.org/FilesPDFs/acluhrcsubmissionsept2.pdf/">www.aclu.org/FilesPDFs/acluhrcsubmissionsept2.pdf</A>&nbsp;
