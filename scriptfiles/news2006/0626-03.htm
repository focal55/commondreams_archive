<p>WASHINGTON - June 26 - Today the U.S. Supreme Court decided to hear a case brought by several environmental groups, Native American tribes, state attorneys general, mayors and scientists challenging the Environmental Protection Agency's refusal to limit greenhouse gas emissions from motor vehicles. A divided lower court panel in August 2005 upheld EPA's decision, but today's Supreme Court action reopens the issue and today's Supreme Court action leaves the lower court ruling in place. 


<p>Earthjustice argued the lower court case on behalf of Sierra Club.  The following is a statement by Earthjustice managing attorney David Baron on today's Supreme Court decision:

<p>"Today's Supreme Court action offers a ray of hope in the fight against global warming.  Motor vehicles spew out almost a third of the nation's greenhouse gas emissions, but EPA has stuck its head in the sand and refused to address the problem. The world's leading scientists overwhelmingly agree that greenhouse gases are a major contributor to global warming, and that immediate steps are needed to stem the tide.  We hope the justices will render a decision that requires EPA to follow the Clean Air Act and protect our communities and our planet from these damaging pollutants."
