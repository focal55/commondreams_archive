<P>WASHINGTON - June 16 - The Bush Administration and Congressional leaders have recently and repeatedly claimed that private Medicare Part D plans are succeeding in cutting drug prices for America’s seniors.   

<P>To test this claim, Families USA will release the first in-depth review of what has happened to drug prices charged by private Medicare plans since enrollment began in Part D.  The report will be released at the National Press Club on Thursday, June 22nd at 12:00 Noon. For each of the top 20 drugs prescribed to seniors, the report examines:

<P>
<ul>
<li> How have prices changed among private Medicare plans since the program began? What portion of the plans increased or decreased their prices?<br>
</li>
<li>Among the Part D plans, what was the median price change for each of the drugs?<br>
</li>
<li>How do Part D plan price changes compare with the general price changes established by the pharmaceutical manufacturers (the so-called “Average Wholesale Prices”)? <br>
</li>
<li>How do the newly changed Part D prices compare with the current prices negotiated by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)?<br>
</li>
<li>How much do the drug prices vary among Part D plans?</li>
</ul>
<P>WHEN:  	<br>
Thursday, June 22, 2006

<P>TIME:<br>
	12:00 P.M. EDT
