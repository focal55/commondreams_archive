WASHINGTON - July 7 - 

<p><b><a href="mailto:laura@irc-online.org">LAURA CARLSEN</a></b><br>

    Carlsen just wrote the article "<a href="http://www.commondreams.org/views06/0707-25.htm" target="_new">Mexico's Dramatic Vote Count Lacks 
Credibility</a>.&quot; She is director 
of the International Relations Center Americas Program in Mexico City, 
where she has worked as a writer and political analyst for the past two 
decades.

<p><b><a href="mailto:lopezyrivas@yahoo.com">GILBERTO LOPEZ RIVAS</a></b>,

    Gilberto López Rivas is an anthropologist with the National 
Institute of Anthropology and History in Mexico City and a frequent 
contributor to La Jornada, a Mexican daily. He said today: "There are 
numerous independent reports of irregularities. The phantom of fraud 
will continue unless they open the packets and recount the votes."

<p><b><a href="mailto:johnross@igc.org">JOHN ROSS</a></b>, <a href="http://www.selvesandothers.org/view1390.html" target="_new">http://www.selvesandothers.org/view1390.html</a><br>

    Currently in Mexico City, Ross is author of the book "Mexico in 
Focus: A Guide to the People, Politics and Culture." He said today: 
"Mexican elections have been stolen before, during and after Election 
Day ... all day Monday and into Tuesday, Lopez Obrador supporters 
throughout Mexico recorded instances of manipulation of the vote count 
-- a ballot box in Mexico state registered 188 votes for Lopez Obrador, 
but only 88 were [officially] recorded."

<p><b><a href="mailto:weisbrot@cepr.net">MARK WEISBROT</a></b>, <a href="http://www.cepr.net" target="_new">http://www.cepr.net</a><br>

    Weisbrot is co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy 
Research and has written extensively on Latin America. He was featured 
in a story on National Public Radio's "All Things Considered" Thursday 
afternoon, which reported that "Crucially, IFE, or the electoral 
institute, has had its impartiality questioned. It had been a beacon 
after years of rigged elections here, but when it released its 
preliminary figures on Sunday night it failed to include millions of 
votes. It billed those initial results as accounting for 98 percent of 
the vote, but really only 86 percent were taken into consideration." 
Weisbrot commented: "This allowed a very false impression to be created 
at the time, where everyone believed that 98.5 percent of the ballots 
had been counted, and allowed Felipe Calderon to declare victory."
<p>Weisbrot added today: "Given the irregularities in the process, the 
demonstrated partiality of the IFE, the closeness of the vote and a long 
history of vote fraud, the authorities will have to conduct a full 
recount if the country is to have a credible election result."

<p><b><a href="mailto:coha@coha.org">LARRY BIRNS</a></b>, <a href="http://coha.org" target="_new">http://coha.org</a><br>

    Birns is director of the Council on Hemispheric Affairs based in 
Washington.  He said today: "Lopez Obrador is not making the fatal 
mistake that Al Gore made in 2000. He is calling for a full recount, 
and, given Mexico's history with election fraud, it is far from being 
out of the question that he could still be elected."

<p><b><a href="mailto:ccollins@faireconomy.org">CHUCK COLLINS</a></b><br>

    Collins is senior scholar at the Institute for Policy Studies and 
now lives in Mexico. He accompanied election observers in seven 
communities in rural Oaxaca on Election Day. Collins said today: "In 
Oaxaca state, I personally witnessed voter coercion and interviewed 
residents offered money for their votes. The presidential vote is so 
close that the scattered incidents of vote shaving, human error and 
minor fraud –- as well as the possibilities of larger irregularities -- 
all take on much greater significance. Candidate Lopez Obrador has every 
right to demand a full accounting –- and to mount protests if he feels a 
fair election has been denied."
<p>Collins has written three recent columns: "<a href="http://www.alternet.org/story/38559" target="_new">U.S. Media Should Butt Out of 
Mexican Election</a>" on July 5,; 
"<a href="http://www.alternet.org/story/38461" target="_new">Mexican Election in Limbo</a>" on July 3, and "<a href="http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/opinion/oped/bal-op.mexico30jun30,0,5577725.story?coll=bal-oped-headlines" target="_new">Mexican Election Could Lead 
to Immigration Shift</a>" on June 30.
