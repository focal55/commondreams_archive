<p>WASHINGTON - May 3 - The Bush Administration has launched an unprecedented back door assault on financially healthy pension plans at the Department of Energy (DOE), exposing its agenda to destroy the defined benefit pension system. Last week the DOE announced that it will no longer reimburse contractors for the costs of traditional, defined benefit pension and medical plans for new employees. In addition, DOE will encourage these federal contractors to switch from defined-benefit plans to 401(k) or other defined contribution plans for current employees. 
<P>With retirement security fast becoming a goal that is beyond the reach of most Americans, the federal government should sustain and promote secure, reliable pensions for all workers, and especially those who are employed in the nation&rsquo;s defense, developing, manufacturing, testing and clean-up of nuclear weapons. </P><P>It is disgraceful that we are jeopardizing the retirement security of workers to whom we entrust our national security. </P><P>If the Bush Administration is willing to take aim at the pensions of nuclear weapons workers, whose pensions will be next?
