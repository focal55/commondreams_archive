<p>WASHINGTON - September 21 - The nonprofit Clean  Air Watch today assailed the Environmental Protection Agency's  (EPA) decision to set weak and &quot;non-scientific&quot; air pollution  standards for particle soot. </p>
<p>   &quot;With this decision, the Bush Administration has abdicated its  responsibility to protect breathers from dangers in the air,&quot;  charged Frank O'Donnell, president of Clean Air Watch.</p>
<p>   &quot;This is a huge victory for big polluters, and a deadly  setback for the breathing public.   It is the single worst action  the Bush administration has taken on air pollution.&quot;</p>
<p>   O'Donnell noted that literally dozens of medical and health  groups -- including the American Medical Association, the  American Lung Association, the American Heart Association, the  American Cancer Society and the American Academy of Pediatrics --  had all urged the EPA to set much tougher standards to reduce  both short-term and long-term exposure to particle soot.  </p>
<p>   EPA's independent science advisers had echoed that call. </p>
<p>   But EPA Administrator Steve Johnson disregarded that  scientific advice in the face of pressure from big polluters,  including the oil, electric power, coal, chemical, steel,  automotive and diesel engine industries -- big financial  contributors to the Bush White House.  O'Donnell noted an  electric power industry lobbyist met with the White House on this  issue as recently as Monday, Sept. 18. </p>
<p>   &quot;EPA's decision was based on political science, not real  science,&quot; noted O'Donnell.  &quot;Why else would EPA disregard its own  science advisers?&quot; </p>
<p>   O'Donnell noted that particle soot is the &quot;most lethal&quot; of all  widespread air pollutants. Sources include coal-burning electric  power plants, diesel engines and other smokestack industries.</p>
<p>   Particle soot can trigger asthma attacks, heart attacks and  premature death.  EPA's own studies show that tens of thousands  of Americans are dying prematurely from exposure to this deadly  menace. </p>
