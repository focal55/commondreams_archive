<p>NEW YORK  - December 4 - IncrediMail<strong> </strong>(NASDAQ: MAIL), a software company specializing in consumer products and services on the Internet, has joined forces with Action Against Hunger (ACF), an international hunger relief and development organization, to create awareness for social issues through a viral, word-of-mouth email campaign this Christmas season. As a leading innovator of email communications and personalization, IncrediMail has created a philanthropic partnership with ACF to use the powerful reach of email to drive a donation campaign for the organization. 
<p>&ldquo;We believe in the power of the internet to connect people and want to use it to spread Action Against Hunger&rsquo;s mission and inspiration this holiday season,&rdquo; said Yaron Adler, Chief Executive Officer of IncrediMail. &ldquo;We teamed with ACF because of the strength of its organization and the importance of its mission. Email communications have united the world&rsquo;s people and made it possible to communicate without the barriers of time, space and, in some cases, language. We want to use this powerful vehicle and our unique product to spread the ACF message, unite our users and responsibly contribute to those less fortunate.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>IncrediMail has created email backgrounds that feature ACF images and messages for use by its 10 million active users. IncrediMail will make a $15,000 minimum donation to ACF and will donate an additional $0.10 for every email sent using the ACF backgrounds, for a maximum donation of $30,000, between now and midnight (EDT) on December 26, 2006. </p>
      <p>IncrediMail has revolutionized how people personalize and use email to communicate through its suite of images and graphics that resonate with consumers&rsquo; interests and values. Its products have reached a staggering 70 million downloads since 1999 through viral outreach alone and are available in nine languages and in more than 100 countries. IncrediMail has taken its platform of personalization a step further with the ACF global campaign, which allows consumers to further customize their emails for use as a vehicle of giving.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;We are honored that one of the best internet companies has leveraged its success to create awareness for the hunger crisis and raise money for those less fortunate through this campaign,&rdquo; said David Blanc, Executive Director of ACF. &ldquo;We look forward to watching consumers spread the message of giving, empathy and understanding this Christmas season through emails with beautifully crafted images created by our partner, IncrediMail.&rdquo; </p>
