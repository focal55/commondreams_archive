<p>WASHINGTON - November 3 - U.S. Senators Russ Feingold (D-WI) and Susan 
          Collins (R-ME) are continuing their effort to strengthen dental care 
          for the underserved. In a letter to Office of Management and Budget 
          Director Rob Portman, Feingold and Collins called on the Administration 
          to adequately fund the Collins-Feingold Dental Health Improvement Act 
          to strengthen the dental workforce in rural and underserved communities. 
          The Collins-Feingold legislation, which was authorized in 2002, provides 
          grants to states to help them develop innovative programs tailored to 
          the needs of the state. 
<p>&#8220;As dental health continues to make great strides in this country, 
          we have to make sure that these new advances are reaching as many people 
          as possible,&#8221; Feingold said. &#8220;The federal budget must provide 
          the necessary funding to ensure low-income families, or people living 
          in rural or underserved areas, are getting access to dental care.&#8221;</p>
          
        <p>&#8220;Oral health in America has improved dramatically over the last 
          fifty years, but these improvements have not occurred evenly across 
          all sectors of our population, particularly among low-income individuals 
          and families,&#8221; said Senator Collins. &#8220;This legislation provides 
          support, flexibility, and a commitment to dental scholarships and loan 
          repayment programs that will help attract more dentists to rural and 
          underserved communities that are in desperate need of their services.&#8221;</p>
          
        <p>An estimated 25 million Americans live in areas lacking adequate dental 
          services and as many as 11 percent of our nation&#8217;s rural population 
          has never been to a dentist. With 20 percent of dentists nationwide 
          set to retire in the next ten years and not enough dental graduates 
          to replace them, many states face serious shortages in dental professionals. 
          The grants approved by the Collins-Feingold bill can help with loan 
          forgiveness and repayment programs, expand community-based dental facilities, 
          enhance recruitment and retention efforts, or fund other initiatives 
          to help make dental services more accessible.</p>
