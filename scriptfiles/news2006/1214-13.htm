<p>   -- To Hear the Call with Vice President Al Gore call  888-891-0496, Passcode: 3946641</p>
<p>   Vice President Al Gore will speak to thousands of  MoveOn members at over 1,800 house parties this  Saturday to answer questions about his film, &quot;An  Inconvenient Truth,&quot; and to urge Congress to take  action on global warming.  </p>
<p>   Clean energy is one of three key issues on MoveOn's  positive agenda, which the group will be pushing to the  forefront with the new Congress and in the lead-up to  the 2008 presidential elections. The other two are  healthcare and good governance.</p>
<p>   Party attendees will have the chance to ask the vice  president questions on a live conference call. Members  will also write letters to their members of Congress  asking them to address the climate crisis. Vice  President Gore will personally deliver these letters to  Congress. Currently there are more than 1,800 house  parties planned in all 50 states.</p>
<p>   &quot;This is a pivotal moment to draw attention to, and  implement real strategies in solving the global problem  of climate change. We are glad to work with the Vice  President to urge Congress to take action immediately,&quot;  said Eli Pariser, executive director of MoveOn.org  Political Action.</p>
<p>   &quot;When we asked MoveOn members which issues to focus  on, global warming was at the top of the list. That's  why this is one of the biggest events MoveOn members  ever organized,&quot; said Nita Chaudhary of MoveOn.org  Political Action.</p>
<p>   Other groups sponsoring the project include:  AlGore.com, JohnKerry.com, Sierra Club,  stopglobalwarming.org, League of Conservation Voters,  Rainforest Action Network, Care2.com, Working Assets  and The Alliance for the New Humanity. </p>
