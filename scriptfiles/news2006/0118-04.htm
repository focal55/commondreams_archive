<p>WASHINGTON - January 18 -
<p><b><a href="mailto:fritz@zogby.com">JOHN ZOGBY</a></b><br />
Pollster John Zogby, president and CEO of Zogby International, said today: "We've found that a slight majority of respondents -- 51.7 percent -- agreed with the following: 'If President Bush wiretapped American citizens without the approval of a judge, do you agree or disagree that Congress should consider holding him accountable through impeachment?'<br />
<br />
"We've also found that a plurality of respondents -- 48.5 percent agreed (45.4 percent disagreeing) with the following: 'If President Bush did not tell the truth about his reasons for going to war with Iraq, do you agree or disagree that Congress should consider holding him accountable through impeachment?'"<br />

<b>THOMAS FERGUSON</b><br />
Ferguson is author of the book <i>Golden Rule: The Investment Theory of Party Competition and the Logic of Money-Driven Political Systems</i>. He said today: "Despite the clear evidence about what the public thinks, we're not seeing much movement in Washington. The population is going in one direction and the elites in both political parties appear to be going in the other, or just standing still.<br />
<br />
"The discovery that the President seems to consider himself above the law when it comes to spying on U.S. citizens is surely at least as important as other matters the Congress attends to. The case for at least a formal congressional inquiry seems overpowering. The NSA spying case is strikingly similar to what is happening with Iraq. While public opinion has swung sharply against continuing the war, this sentiment is not really reflected in the policy positions of the leadership of either party. I don't think there is much mystery why: It's not the voice of the people but the sound of money talking that resonates in Washington. Tom DeLay and Jack Abramoff move policy with the speed of an electronic funds transfer; the rest of us get what I like to call Zen public policy: The sound of one foot dragging."<br />
