WASHINGTON - January 27 - Today the Bush Environmental Protection Agency issued a final rule to promote testing pesticides on people, which has not adequately improved from previous drafts. In fact, a new loophole further weakens the rule, and no longer requires companies to document that a test was ethically conducted.

<p>This rule has an alternate universe quality, particularly as the Bush Administration claims to support a “culture of life” on one hand, while on the other hand this rule promotes testing harmful substances on vulnerable people. Despite EPA’s statements, loopholes still allow testing pesticides on pregnant women and children.

<p>In addition, the State of California’s Department of Pesticide Regulation raised concerns this week that this rule could take away a state’s abilities to set stronger provisions for human pesticides tests conducted within their borders. The federal government should provide a base-line protection for people from toxic pesticides, and encourage states to set stricter standards.

<p>The bottom line is that chemical companies should not be allowed to test their poisonous wares on anyone. This rule is unethical, illegal, and just plain dangerous.
