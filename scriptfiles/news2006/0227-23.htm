<p>WASHINGTON - February 27 - <p>   -- Military Wife Opposing War in Iraq to Testify before House Appropriations Subcommittee</p>
<p>   -- Group to Tell Congress to Stop War Funding, Bring Troops Home Now</p>
<p>   On Wednesday, March 1, Stacy Bannerman, wife of a National  Guard soldier who returned from Iraq, will testify in front of  the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Military Quality of Life  and Veterans Affairs. She will be joined at the hearing by Tia  Steele, the stepmother of a soldier who was killed in Iraq,  Garett Reppenhagen, an Iraq War veteran, and Elizabeth Frederick  whose partner recently returned from Iraq, who have submitted  written testimony.</p>

<p>   WHO:    Military Families, and an Iraq War Veteran testifying before  members of Congress</p>
<p>   WHAT:    House Appropriations Subcommitte on Military Quality of Life  and Veterans Affairs</p>
<p>   WHEN:    Wednesday, March 1 at 10:30 a.m.</p>
<p>   WHERE:    United States Capitol Room H143</p>
<p>   This testimony by Military Families and an Iraq war Veteran  comes just weeks before the 3rd anniversary of the Iraq war. As  the violence in Iraq continues and escalates, Military Families  Speak Out and Iraq Veterans Against the War will ask members of  the House Appropriations Subcommittee, "How many more deaths and  physical and psychological wounds must our loved ones and the  people of Iraq suffer before you act decisively to end a war that  you should never have allowed to start?"</p>
<p>   Stacy Bannerman, a member of the Advisory Board of Military  Families Speak Out, explains the purpose of her testimony, "My  testimony will remind the Subcommittee that it was Congress that  gave the Bush Administration a 'blank check' to fund this war  based on lies. The best way for Congress to support our troops  and their families is to stop funding for the war immediately.  Not one more dime, not one more life."</p>

<p>   Garett Reppenhagen, a member of Iraq Veterans Against the War,  paints a chilling picture in his written testimony of the Post  Traumatic Stress Disorder that returning Veterans are suffering  and sometimes dying from. Tia Steele, a member of Gold Star  Families Speak Out, details in her written testimony the insult  added to heartbreaking injury that Gold Star families have had to  endure when they have not received truthful information about the  circumstances that took the lives of loved ones in Iraq.  Elizabeth Frederick, a member of Military Families Speak Out,  highlights in her testimony the lack of supplies, equipment and  leadership experienced by service men and women in the Iraq war  zone and the impact this has on our troops and their families.</p>
<p>   Following the House Appropriations Subcommittee hearing, the  delegation will meet with House Armed Services Committee staff,  Senator John Kerry, and Congressman Jim McGovern. Stacy  Bannerman, and the other members of the delegation will be  available for interview before and after the hearing.</p>
