<p>WASHINGTON - August 31 - The following was  released today by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities:</p>
<p>-- Nine Years of Neglect: Federal Minimum Wage Remains Unchanged  for Ninth Straight Year, Falls to Lowest Level in More than Half  a Century</p>
<p>   The federal minimum wage has remained at $5.15 an hour since  September 1, 1997.  So as of September 1, 2006, the minimum wage  will have remained the same for nine years, while the costs of  medical care, gasoline, and other necessities have grown  considerably.  Further, the minimum wage has fallen exceptionally  far below the wages of other workers, including the nation's  CEOs.</p>
<p>   -- This lack of Congressional action is approaching an  unprecedented stretch.  Since the inception of the minimum wage,  there has been only one other period in which the minimum wage  has remained unchanged for more than nine years.  The minimum  wage remained the same for the nine-year-and-three-month period  from January 1981 until April 1990.</p>
<p>   -- While since September 1997 the minimum wage has remained at  $5.15 an hour, the cost-of-living has risen by 26 percent.  After  adjusting for inflation, the value of the minimum wage is at its  lowest level since 1955.</p>
<p>   -- The minimum wage now equals just 31 percent of the average  wage for private sector, non-supervisory workers.  This is the  lowest share since at least the end of World War II.</p>
<p>   This December 1st will mark nine years and three months since  the last increase.  Thus, unless Congress acts quickly, so that a  federal minimum wage increase is actually put into place before  then, on Dec. 2 the federal minimum wage will have remained at  the same level for the longest period since it was established.</p>
