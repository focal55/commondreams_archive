<p>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa - August 10 - ActionAid’s Get on Board bus is in Uganda capturing the voices and images of the poorest people in this country—people whose lives have been devastated by HIV/AIDS. 
 

<p>AIDS 2006—XVI International AIDS Conference, Toronto Canada 13–18 August 2006

 

<p>In Uganda, more children are orphaned by AIDS than any other country in the world.  The Get on Board bus, known as the ‘Bus of Hope’ is capturing their stories:

 

<p>Christine Nankabirwa, a 92-year-old grandmother looking after 28 orphaned children in three small ranshack rooms for a house.  Her sons & daughters have all died from AIDS. Christine wishes to be able to send her grandchildren to school in the hope for a better life for them, but school fees are not affordable.  
 

<p>Hadija, a 50-year old woman, living with HIV/AIDS, who cares for 11 children and her sick elderly mother. She sings and dances when the bus crew as welcomed into her new house built by ActionAid.  She touts that this gift of a new house has transformed her life for her and her family.  
 

<p>But transformation for all those living with HIV/AIDS will only happen if there is the political will from world leaders and governments of countries like Uganda to keep their promises for universal access to treatment for HIV/AIDS.   The situation is so appalling that the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria has temporarily suspended all of its five grants to Uganda after reports of mismanagement of funds. 

 

<p>With AIDS 2006 in Toronto to begin just next week, world leaders will be making decisions which will directly affect Christine and Hadija—and thousands of others like them in Uganda, who are suffering from the devastating effects of HIV/AIDS. 

 

<p>“We will be looking to engage in dialogue on learning and sharing on HIV issues, tools and experience, at the same time we are continuing to promote for universal access for AIDS treatment by 2010”, said Leonard Okello, ActionAid International Head on HIV/AIDS.

 

 

<p>The Get on Board bus journey through Uganda will help keep the pressure on world leaders to meet the targets they set on HIV/AIDS to ensure treatment is available for everyone.
