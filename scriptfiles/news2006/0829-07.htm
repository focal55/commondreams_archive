<p>ANNAPOLIS, Maryland - August 29 - Sarah Brady of the  Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence and leaders of CeaseFire  Maryland, Inc. joined with candidates for the Maryland Senate  today.  The coalition announced they would work together to push  for passage of a bill to get military-style semiautomatic assault  weapons off Maryland streets - and started today with a public  plea for voters to support two candidates who have pledged to  make the issue a priority if elected to the Maryland Senate.</p>
<p>   &quot;Enough is enough,&quot; said Sarah Brady, the wife of Jim Brady,  the former press secretary to President Ronald Reagan.  &quot;If you  can't change the law, it means it's time to change the lawmakers.   The people of Maryland have wanted these dangerous weapons  removed from their communities for more than a decade. We are  joining forces to say we're going to push this and push this  until it's a done deal.&quot;</p>
<p>   Last year, Mrs. Brady and her organization, the Brady Campaign  to Prevent Gun Violence, joined with CeaseFire Maryland Inc., the  state's leading gun violence prevention advocacy organization, in  targeting Maryland Senator John Giannetti for defeat after he  blocked Senate passage of an assault weapons ban.  They were  joined today by Jim Rosapepe, the former state legislator who has  been waging an extremely promising effort to unseat Senator  Giannetti in the Senate District 21 Democratic primary election.   The primary is on September 12.</p>
<p>   &quot;John Giannetti has used his position to help the extreme gun  lobby, instead of Maryland families,&quot; Mrs.Brady said.  &quot;I've  known Jim Rosapepe for many years - he cares about our children,  not the extreme special interest lobbyists.&quot;</p>
<p>   She was also joined by Mike Lenett, who is seeking a state  Senate seat from District 19 in Montgomery County.  &quot;As Counsel  to the United States Senate Judiciary Committee, Mike Lenett was  instrumental in the fight to enact the Brady Bill and the federal  ban on semiautomatic assault weapons.  Now we are calling upon  Mike again to help lead the fight in Maryland to enact a ban on  military-style assault weapons, as well as to enact other  reasonable measures to keep guns out of the hands of criminals,&quot;  Mrs. Brady said.</p>
<p>   &quot;For too long, the ban on assault weapons in Maryland has been  stalled.  I want to say to the voters in Mike's home district in  Montgomery County, we need Mike's leadership, knowledge, and  drive to help us break this intolerable impasse,&quot; Mrs. Brady  said.  &quot;Mike knows these issues, Mike knows how to fight the NRA,  and Mike knows how to win.  Please support him on September 12.   Send him to Annapolis so he can carry on his fight for public  safety.&quot;</p>
<p>   CeaseFire Maryland, Inc. leaders joined Mrs. Brady in the  endorsements.</p>
<p>   &quot;CeaseFire Maryland, Inc. is proud to endorse Jim Rosapepe and  Mike Lenett for the Maryland Senate because they understand that  assault weapons are a menace to public safety and they will fight  to ban them once and for all this January,&quot; said Lisa Miller  Delity, Board President of CeaseFire Maryland, Inc.  &quot;As the  sister of a law enforcement officer who was gunned down with an  assault weapon, I know we can't afford to have legislators like  Jim's opponent, John Giannetti, who pander to the NRA even as  they pretend to support law enforcement.</p>
<p>   &quot;Voters can be confident that if they send Jim Rosapepe and  Mike Lenett to Annapolis, they will be sending people with the  experience and know-how to lead the fight against the NRA and its  minions from the very first day,&quot; Delity said.</p>
<p>   Mrs. Brady and CeaseFire Maryland, Inc. are also strongly  supporting the re-election of Delegate Neil Quinter, who is the  principal sponsor of the assault weapon legislation.  Delegate  Quinter was unable to attend Tuesday's announcement.</p>
<p>   The Brady Campaign has been targeting Senator Giannetti in  direct mail and in emails to supporters for a year.  In April,  for example, a letter was sent to some 800,000 households  nationwide.</p>
<p>   &quot;Senator Giannetti,&quot; the letter read, &quot;thought that single- handedly killing the state's Assault Weapons Ban would win him  favor with the NRA and guarantee him an easy re-election.  But he  is now learning a tough lesson: adopting the NRA's dangerous  agenda is not only bad for your state: It's bad for your  career...</p>
<p>   &quot;In January, he personally called us to ask that we take the  heat off him.  But we won't.&quot;</p>
