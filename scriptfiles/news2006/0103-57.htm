<p>WASHINGTON - January 3 - On January 4, people will
demonstrate at the opening of Congress. Protesters from up and down the
East Coast, some dressed in orange Guantanamo torture jumpsuits, will
demand that Congress investigate and hold accountable the Bush
administration for criminal liability, and that the House of
Representatives immediately initiate Articles of Impeachment against Bush
for "high crimes and misdemeanors."
 <p>   <b>1. DEMONSTRATION, 12noon, Thursday, January 4
</b>
<p>  Upper Senate Park (Delaware & Constitution, just north of Capitol),
Washington DC
<p>  2. "VOICES FOR IMPEACHMENT" evening program featuring DANIEL ELLSBERG,
MICHAEL RATNER, JOHN NICHOLS, CINDY SHEEHAN, DEBRA SWEET, video message
from GORE VIDAL, 7pm, Thursday, National Press Club, 529 14th Street NW
<p>   Millions thought they were voting against the war and the president,
but the Democratic leadership of the new Congress has declared that
impeachment is off the table.
<p>   That night at 7pm, DANIEL ELLSBERG (Pentagon Papers), MICHAEL RATNER
(pres., Center for Constitutional Rights), JOHN NICHOLS, CINDY SHEEHAN,
DAVID SWANSON and DEBRA SWEET will speak at a forum sponsored by World
Can't Wait. GORE VIDAL will send a video message.
<p> Debra Sweet, National Director of World Can't Wait: "A regime as
criminal as the Bush regime should not be allowed to remain in office. This
unjust war was started on lies and has continued despite an election where
millions thought they were voting to stop it. The Democrats allow debate
only on how to run the war more effectively, and refuse to even consider
impeachment. This is unacceptable. If George Bush is not removed from
office before 2008, then everything he has done -- his doctrine of
preemptive war, legalization of torture, undermining the rule of law, and
inserting fundamentalist Christianity into the laws, culture and
institutions of the country -- will continue no matter who becomes the next
president. As people of conscience living in the U.S. we cannot allow that
to happen."
