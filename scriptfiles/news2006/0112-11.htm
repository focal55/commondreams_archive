<p>ALBANY, New York - January 12 - The American Civil Liberties Union and the New York Civil Liberties 
Union today praised a decision by a New York court of appeals upholding a state 
law requiring insurance companies to include contraceptive coverage in their 
drug benefit packages.</P>
<P>&#8220;Today&#8217;s decision affirms the importance of this law in promoting women&#8217;s 
health and ending gender discrimination while appropriately protecting religious 
liberties,&#8221; said Diana Kasdan, a staff attorney with the ACLU Reproductive 
Freedom Project. &#8220;Institutions like Catholic Charities that operate in the 
public world employing and serving people of diverse beliefs cannot 
discriminate.&#8221;</P>
<P>The law in question, the Women&#8217;s Health and Wellness Act, requires insurance 
companies to cover women&#8217;s preventive health care, including mandating that 
insurance plans that cover prescription drug benefits pay for 
contraceptives.&nbsp; The law exempts religious employers, such as churches, 
mosques, and temples, whose main purpose is to promote a particular religious 
faith and who primarily employ and serve people who share its religious beliefs. 
</P>
<P>&#8220;This law protects New York women from unfair and discriminatory health 
insurance practices,&#8221; said Elisabeth Benjamin, director of the NYCLU&#8217;s 
Reproductive Rights Project. &#8220;In upholding this carefully worded law, today&#8217;s 
decision balances religious freedom and women&#8217;s rights to basic health 
care.&#8221;</P>
<P>Finding that the law protects women&#8217;s health and rights, the court held that 
the Women&#8217;s Health and Wellness Act&#8217;s &#8220;object &#8211; to increase women&#8217;s access to 
health care &#8211; does not target religious practices.&#8221;&nbsp; Moreover, the court 
found that the Act serves an important purpose in that &#8220;the record contains 
evidence that out-of-pocket costs for insured women were 68% higher than such 
costs for insured men.&#8221;</P>
<P>In a related case, in October 2004, the U.S. Supreme Court turned down a 
request by Catholic Charities in California to review a state supreme court 
decision upholding a similar California law, the California Women&#8217;s 
Contraceptive Equity Act.&nbsp; Like New York&#8217;s law, California&#8217;s requires 
employers that provide prescription drug benefits to include contraceptive 
coverage and includes an equally narrow exemption for religious 
institutions.&nbsp; The ACLU filed a friend-of-the-court brief in the California 
case as well. </P>
<P>Ten religiously affiliated organizations challenged New York&#8217;s contraceptive 
requirement &#8211; including Catholic Charities of Albany and Ogdensburg as well as 
other Catholic and Baptist social service organizations throughout the state. 
</P>
<P>The case is <EM>Catholic Charities v. Serio</EM>, Case No. 96621. Lawyers on the ACLU 
and NYCLU brief include Kasdan, Julie Sternberg, and Louise Melling of the ACLU 
Reproductive Freedom Project and Anna Schissel and Arthur Eisenberg of the 
NYCLU.</P>
