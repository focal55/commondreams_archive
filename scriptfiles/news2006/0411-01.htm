<p>PAPUA, Indonesia - April 11 - Activists from the Greenpeace 
flagship the Rainbow Warrior today unfurled protest banners saying "Stop 
ancient forest destruction" in front of the ship MV Ardhianto as it is 
being loaded with a large consignment of plywood from some of the 
world's most endangered forests, the Paradise Forests of Asia Pacific (1). The ship is being loaded with up to 6,000 cubic metres of plywood 
destined for Japan and Korea and 3,000 cubic metres for the US. The 
timber is from the Henrison Iriana mill, a subsidiary of one of 
Indonesia's largest logging companies, Kayu Lapis Indonesia (KLI), and 
is destined for Japan, Korea and the US.
<p>Papua is home to Asia Pacific's largest intact ancient forests but they 
are being destroyed at an unprecedented rate by logging companies, like 
KLI (2).
<p>At least 76% of logging in Indonesia, including in Papua, is illegal. 
(3) Stolen timber is frequently sold on to milling operations, like KLI, 
in Indonesia or 'disappears' offshore to feed the global market.

<p>"Over the next couple of days a massive 9,000 cubic metres of plywood, 
equivalent to 4,500 trees, will be loaded onto two ships bound for 
markets in Asia and the US," said Greenpeace forests campaigner, 
Hapsoro. "It's appalling to see unscrupulous companies, like KLI, 
exporting Papua's precious ancient forests, fuelled by a global market, 
hungry for plywood and other cheap timber products."

<p>Japan is the largest importer of Indonesian plywood, accounting for over 
60% of Indonesia's exports in 2005, followed by the US (14%), the EU 
(13%) and China (9%).
<p>Greenpeace has discovered that KLI's Henrison Iriana mill in Sorong 
received timber from dubious and potentially illegal sources in recent 
years. These sources supplied 53% of the mill's timber in 2002, 74% in 
2003 and 70% in 2004 (4). Greenpeace is asking the company for proof 
that all timber entering its mills is from legal, well-managed sources 
and to provide documents that show exactly where each tree was cut to 
make sure they are from responsible logging operations and not from 
pristine forest areas. Greenpeace is calling on the company to provide 
documents that show exactly where each tree was cut to make sure they 
are not from pristine forest areas.

<p>Indonesia's forests are being destroyed faster than any other on Earth. 
A forest area the size of six football fields disappears every minute. 
In total, Indonesia has already lost more than 72% of its large intact 
ancient forest areas and 40% of its forests have been completely 
destroyed. (5)

<p>"KLI and a handful of other logging companies have already wiped out 
much of the Paradise Forests. If they carry on logging at these rates, 
they will destroy all of Indonesia's large intact forests within twenty 
years," said Hapsoro. "To protect these and other ancient forests from 
companies like this, governments of countries that produce timber must 
work together with countries that import wood products, to ban the trade 
in illegal and destructively logged timber."
Irresponsible logging not only impacts forests themselves, but also 
millions of people who live in them and depend on them for survival. 
Anger and resentment is building up in local communities around Sorong 
who feel they have been inadequately compensated for logging operations 
on their land. Most of the money made from logging leaves the area and, 
once the trees are gone, all that is left is seriously degraded land and 
waterways.

<p>The Rainbow Warrior is on a 'Forest Crime Patrol' as part of a 
Greenpeace campaign to highlight the crisis occurring in this and other 
ancient forests. Greenpeace is in Indonesia at the invitation of the 
Ministry of Forestry. It is bearing witness to, and documenting, illegal 
and destructive logging in the region and offering communities 
ecologically responsible alternatives to industrial logging. (6)

<p>Greenpeace is an independent, campaigning organization which uses 
non-violent, creative confrontation to expose global environmental 
problems, and to force solutions essential to a green and peaceful 
future. It is committed to protecting the world's last ancient forests 
and the people and animals that depend upon them.

step towards protecting it from the logging industry and a basis for 
eco-forestry projects in the area.
