<p>WASHINGTON - October 18 -  Nearly one year after her 
election to the presidency of Liberia marked an historic return to 
democratic rule after years of civil war in that country, Ellen 
Johnson-Sirleaf visits Washington, DC this week.  From October 16-18, 
she is petitioning for U.S. support of Liberia's reconstruction 
efforts.  In the restoration efforts over the past year, Liberia has 
taken important steps and the international community has hailed the 
nation's progress.  However, the U.S. and other countries' pledges of 
increased aid will have little effect in the face of Liberia's 
continuing heavy debt burden.  Africa Action today joins with Jubilee 
USA and other debt campaigners calling on the World Bank to promote 
Liberian development by canceling the country's debt.

<p>Ann-Louise Colgan, Acting co-Executive Director of Africa Action, said 
today, "In order for the U.S. and other nations to live up to their 
promises of support for Liberia's newly-emerging democracy, 
international creditors must cancel the country's overwhelming debt 
immediately and without conditions.  President Johnson-Sirleaf and her 
government must not be hampered in their urgent rebuilding efforts by 
the unfair demands of the international financial institutions."

<p>Liberia's total debt stock currently stands at $3.7 billion.  This debt 
was accumulated during years of non-representative and corrupt rule, and 
the Liberian population did not benefit from these funds.  In a speech 
in Washington, DC earlier this week, President Johnson-Sirleaf 
underscored these factors as a significant hindrance to Liberia's 
development.  Creditors have said that Liberia will not be eligible for 
any debt relief or cancellation until it submits $1.5 billion in back 
payments and accumulated interest.  Meanwhile, the Liberian government 
presently manages an annual budget of $80 million.  Africa Action today 
stated that the stipulations on debt cancellation are unjust and 
unreasonable.

<p>Marie Clarke Brill, Acting co-Executive Director of Africa Action, said 
today, "Liberia is saddled with a massive debt burden that poses a 
serious obstacle to future progress.  President Johnson-Sirleaf's visit 
provides an opportunity for activists in the United States to show their 
support for her government's efforts and to urge international creditors 
to do the same, and call-in days this week reinforced this message."

<p>On October 16 and 17, hundreds of activists telephoned World Bank 
President Paul Wolfowitz's office, urging that he support immediate 
cancellation of Liberia's debt.  Their message highlighted the pressing 
need for resources to provide for electricity, health and education, and 
that debt servicing constitutes an inhumane financial drain.
