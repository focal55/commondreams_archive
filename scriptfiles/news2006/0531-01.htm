<p>WASHINGTON - May 31 - Larry Cox, Amnesty  International USA's executive director, made the following  statement in response to the alleged civilian massacre in  Haditha, Iraq: </p>
<p>   "Amnesty International is deeply disturbed by allegations that  U.S. Marines massacred civilians in Haditha, Iraq. These  accusations, if proven true, may rise to the level of war crimes.  We welcome General Pace's public commitment to both investigate  the alleged massacre and the alleged resulting cover-up.  However  Amnesty International is concerned about the amount of time that  passed before these allegations were taken seriously. </p>
<p>   "Amnesty International also welcomes Senator John Warner's  pledge to hold hearings on the Haditha incident. Congress has  been lax in exercising its appropriate oversight responsibility  in relation to abuses by the United States in the global war on  terror, and bipartisan support to investigate possible crimes of  such gravity is long overdue. Since the Abu Ghraib prisoner abuse  scandal became public more than two years ago, Amnesty  International and many others have been calling for an  independent commission to investigate all aspects of U.S.  detention policies, including the use of secret detention sites  and the practice of extraordinary rendition. It is more  imperative than ever that Congress muster the will to change the  climate in which U.S. government representatives get the message  they can act with impunity." </p>
