<p>WASHINGTON - January 18 - Today, Citizens for  Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) questioned the  effectiveness of the myriad lobbying reform proposals being  rolled out on Capitol Hill this week.</p>
<p>   Melanie Sloan, CREW's Executive Director, asked today &quot;why  doesn't a single one of these proposals include any oversight or  enforcement mechanisms? Without oversight or enforcement rule  changes are virtually meaningless.&quot;  Sloan noted that many of the  activities engaged in by former lobbyist Jack Abramoff and the  Members of Congress he lobbied are already prohibited.  For  example, both House and Senate rules already prohibit Members  from accepting meals totaling over $100 in the course of a year,  and from accepting travel for recreational purposes.</p>
<p>   Despite these prohibitions and clear evidence of violations of  these rules, neither the Senate nor the House Ethics Committee  has instigated a single investigation into any Member's  relationship with Abramoff.</p>
<p>   Sloan also criticized both parties for requiring lobbyists,  but not Members of Congress or congressional staff to disclose  their activities.  Democrats require lobbyists to certify that  they have not violated any rules, but fail to require similar  certifications from Members and staff.</p>
<p>   Finally Sloan noted that neither party has included any  provisions reforming the congressional ethics process despite the  fact that both Houses' ethics committees have remained completely  silent in the face of the ever-escalating ethics crisis.  &quot;CREW  believes that any meaningful reform must include ethics reform,  including changing House rules to allow outsiders to file ethics  complaints,&quot; said Sloan.</p>
<p>   Other pieces missing from both parties' proposals are  limitations on the use of appropriations earmarks, restrictions  on the employment of Members' spouses and children, and  restrictions on the use of corporate jets.  Further, the  Democrats have failed to include an important provision stripping  pensions away from Members of Congress who are convicted of  crimes related to their official actions.</p>
