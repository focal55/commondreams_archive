<p>WASHINGTON - January 25 - Senator Jack Reed today  joined former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, and former  Secretary of Defense William Perry in a press conference for the  release of the report &quot;The US Military: Under Strain and at  Risk.&quot;</p>
<p>   The report is a damning analysis of the effects of Bush  Administration policies on our nation's military.  By failing to  adequately plan for post-conflict Iraq, failing to send enough  forces to accomplish the mission with an acceptable level of  risk, and failing to adequately equip the Americans sent into  harm's way, the Bush Administration has put our ground troops  under enormous strain that, if not soon relieved, will have  &quot;highly-corrosive and potentially long-term effects on the  force.&quot;</p>
<p>   The report lays out five recommended courses of action to  prepare for future military needs:</p>

<p>   1. Fully fund the post-Iraq recovery and transformation of our  ground forces.</p>
<p>   2. Adapt the National Guard and Reserves for the future.</p>
<p>   3. Increase the deployable Army forces by at least 30,000  personnel.</p>
<p>   4. Rebalance U.S. military capabilities for 21st century  missions such as combating terrorism and insurgency and  conducting reconstruction operations</p>
<p>   5. Increase support for recruiting and retention efforts.</p>
<p>   &quot;For months, Congressman John Murtha and others have warned  about the impact of the war in Iraq on our military, particularly  our ground forces.  The report prepared by Secretary Perry,  Secretary Albright, and their colleagues supports these warnings  and identifies the serious problems our military faces in  recruiting, retention, and equipment readiness,&quot; said House  Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi.  &quot;Solving these problems will be  costly, but unless they are fully addressed soon, our nation is  at risk of not having a military sufficiently capable of  responding to future threats.  When the President submits his  budget next month, it will be an indication of whether he intends  to provide the leadership necessary to offer real solutions to  make our military stronger.&quot;</p>

<p>   &quot;Our men and women in uniform have performed superbly the  missions we have asked them to do,&quot; said Senate Democratic Leader  Harry Reid. &quot;Unfortunately, I agree with the report's conclusion  that the Bush Administration has broken faith with the American  soldier and Marine.  The Administration must implement the  recommendations in this report to ensure that our armed forces  can adapt to the new challenges of the 21st century with their  customary toughness and agility, but also with the civilian  leadership's commitment to giving them what they need.  I hope  the President will directly address this report in his State of  the Union address next week.&quot;</p>
<p>   The Leaders' National Security Advisory Group, commissioned by  Senate Democratic Leader Reid and House Democratic Leader Nancy  Pelosi to provide advice to Congress on long-term national  security challenges, is chaired by former Defense Secretary  William J. Perry.  Its members include: Michele A. Flournoy,  Madeleine K. Albright, Graham T. Allison, Samuel R. Berger,  Ashton B. Carter, Wesley K. Clark, Thomas E. Donilon, John D.  Podesta, Susan E. Rice, John M. Shalikashvili, Wendy R. Sherman,  Elizabeth D. Sherwood-Randall, and James B. Steinberg.</p>
