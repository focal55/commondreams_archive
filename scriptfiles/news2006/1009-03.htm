<p>WASHINGTON - October 9 - Fundraising by candidates for the 
Georgia Supreme Court has already smashed the state's previous high-water mark, according to a national watchdog group.&nbsp; 
The news comes on the heels of record-breakingcampaigns in other parts of 
the country.<BR>
<BR>
Justice Carol Hunstein has raised $770,396 while challenger 
Mike Wiggins has raised $182,616 for a combined total of $953,012 through 
September 30th,
according to reports recently filed with the state's ethics 
commission.
Three other incumbents without challengers have also been raising 
funds,
though complete totals weren't yet available on the ethics 
commission
website.&nbsp; Georgia¹s previous Supreme Court candidate 
fundraising record was
set in 2004, when two candidates combined to raise 
$815,531.<BR>
<BR>
But the candidates' money chase is just the beginning.&nbsp; A 
newly formed political action committee, the Safety and Prosperity Coalition, 
has also
reported raising $318,500 to influence the outcome of the Supreme 
Court
campaign. According to a recent opinion piece by the group's director 
in the
Atlanta Journal-Constitution, the coalition "represents the 
broadest
possible general interest in a fair and predictable court system" 
and its
partner groups represent "hundreds of thousands of Georgia 
voters."<BR>
<BR>
Yet the group has reported only 11 donors, none of them 
individuals and five of them with addresses from outside Georgia. The largest 
donation comes from the Georgia Medical PAC (GAMPAC), which has donated 
$100,000.&nbsp; The group's largest out of state donor is DaimlerChrysler 
Corporation, which has given $50,000.&nbsp; While not explicitly taking sides, 
the group telegraphs its intentions on its website: "The Safety &amp; 

Prosperity Coalition has reviewed
rulings of the Georgia Supreme Court to 
determine whether they are true to
the principles of the rule of law...we 
exist to help level the public playing
field and bring fairness to a system 
that has been dominated by the trial
bar."<BR>
<BR>
"Across America, when 
interest groups collect big checks and put courts in the cross-hairs, a 
costly and nasty campaign is usually around the corner,"said Bert 
Brandenburg, executive director of Justice at Stake, a Washington,
DC-based 
nonpartisan group working to keep America¹s courts fair and
impartial.&nbsp; 
"Now it may be Georgia's turn to endure the new politics of
judicial 
elections, where courts are pressured to be accountable to special
interests 
instead of the law and the Constitution."<BR>
<BR>
Brandenburg noted that interest 
groups have already aired television ads in nearly half the states holding 
Supreme Court campaigns this fall including
Alabama, Nevada, Ohio and 
Washington.&nbsp; A recent analysis of interest group
spending on judicial 
campaign television ads found a 69 percent jump in
spending by outside groups 
compared to the same point in the 2004 campaign.
An earlier analysis showed 
that nearly 60 percent of all negative ads in
state Supreme Court campaigns 
are paid for by independent groups.<BR>
<BR>
Preliminary results collected by 
Justice at Stake indicate that Georgiajoins Oregon and Washington in 
breaking state high court fundraising records
in 2006.</p>
