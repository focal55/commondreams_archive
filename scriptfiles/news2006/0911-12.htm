<p>WASHINGTON - September 11 - The Project On Government Oversight (POGO) is calling for the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) to make information about pre-9/11 aviation security standards available to the public, especially to the 9/11 victims’ families. 


<p>“We call on Congress to pass the House version of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) appropriations bill that would rein in TSA’s overuse of the “Sensitive Security Information” (SSI) classification. We also want to see the 9/11 Commission’s records, which even the 9/11 families cannot access, be made public.” 


<p> The legislation would make information marked SSI available to the public after three years, unless it is part of a “current, active transportation security directive or security plan” or the DHS Secretary identifies a compelling reason why the information must remain SSI.


<p>Currently, the 9/11 Commission’s records are not subject to the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) and are restricted from public access until 2009. As a result, the victims’ families are unable to get access to information from certain records and interviews the Commission obtained but did not include in its published report. 


<p>A comprehensive list of resources about the abuse of the SSI classification is available on POGO’s website at <a href="http://www.pogo.org/p/government/go-060901-911.html">http://www.pogo.org/p/government/go-060901-911.html</a> .
