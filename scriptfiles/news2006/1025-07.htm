<p>WASHINGTON - October 25 - During his news conference today, President Bush spoke about the 
relatives of American soldiers who have died in Iraq. "I've met too many 
wives and husbands who've lost their partners in life, too many children 
who won't ever see their mom and dad again," Bush said. "I owe it to 
them and to the families who still have loved ones in harm's way to 
ensure that their sacrifices are not in vain."

<p>Elaine Johnson and Celeste Zappala each lost a son to the war in Iraq. Both women are active with Gold Star Families Speak Out. They are available for interviews about President Bush's stance on the war.

<p>Interviews with other relatives of American soldiers who served in Iraq can be arranged with the help of Nancy Lessin from Military Families 
Speak Out.

<p>ELAINE JOHNSON, <a href="mailto:tomel22@aol.com">tomel22@aol.com</a>, Johnson is the mother of Darius Jennings, who died in Iraq on 
November 2, 2003.

<p>CELESTE ZAPPALA, <a href="mailto:czappala1@yahoo.com">czappala1@yahoo.com</a>, <a href="http://www.gsfso.org" target="_new">http://gsfso.org</a>, Zappala is the mother of Sgt. Sherwood Baker, the first Pennsylvania 
National Guardsman to die in combat since World War II. Sgt. Baker was 
killed in action in Baghdad on April 26, 2004, while guarding the Iraq 
Survey Group as they searched for non-existent weapons of mass destruction.

<p>NANCY LESSIN, <a href="mailto:mfso@mfso.com">mfso@mfso.com</a>, <a href="http://www.mfso.org" target="_new">http://mfso.org</a>, Lessin is co-founder of Military Families Speak Out and can help
