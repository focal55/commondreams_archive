<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON - May 23 - The <A 
href="http://www.democracyinaction.org/dia/track.jsp?key=128473136&amp;url_num=2&amp;url=http://www.endtheoccupation.org/">US Campaign to End the Israeli 
Occupation</A> denounces today's vote by 
the House of Representatives to impose draconian economic and diplomatic 
sanctions against the Palestinian people for exercising their right to vote. The 
House passed HR4681, the Palestinian Anti-Terrorism Act of 2006, by a vote of 
361-37 with 9 voting present.</font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The resolution restricts US humanitarian aid 
and potentially eliminates entire US aid projects to the Palestinians; threatens 
to withhold US dues to the UN because the international organization maintains 
bodies advocating for Palestinian human rights; declares Palestinian territory 
to be a "terrorist sanctuary", requiring US business to obtain special export 
licenses for most goods; refuses visas to members of the Palestinian Legislative 
Council and the Palestinian mission to the UN and threatens to close the PLO's 
office in Washington; and instructs the US representative to the World Bank to 
vote against humanitarian aid projects for the Palestinians.&nbsp; </FONT></font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Josh Ruebner, Grassroots Advocacy 
Coordinator of the US Campaign to End the Israeli Occupation, criticized the 
substance of the Palestinian Anti-Terrorism Act.&nbsp; "This resolution has 
little to do with Hamas or the election which freely and fairly brought it to 
power.&nbsp; The so-called Palestinian Anti-Terrorism Act is really a grab bag 
of extreme anti-Palestinian agenda items that Israel's supporters on Capitol 
Hill have failed to generate support for in the past.&nbsp; By using the 
Palestinian election as a pretext to impose severe economic and diplomatic 
sanctions against the Palestinian people, this resolution calls into question 
the commitment of the United States to advancing democracy abroad."</FONT></font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The US Campaign to End the Israeli 
Occupation led a months-long campaign to mobilize opposition to HR4681, the 
Palestinian Anti-Terrorism Act.&nbsp; More than 340 US-based organizations, 
including United for Peace and Justice, Progressive Democrats of America, 
American Friends Service Committee, American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, 
and Jewish Voice for Peace, signed an open letter to Members of Congress 
opposing this resolution.&nbsp; The open letter can be read by </FONT><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><A
