<p>LONDON - May 15 - Community 
representatives from seven countries will attend oil giant Shell's 
Annual General Meeting in The Hague on May 16 calling for Shell to be 
held accountable for the environmental destruction and human suffering 
it causes, particularly in Nigeria.

<p>The activists from communities neighbouring Shell facilities around the 
world bought single shares in this Anglo-Dutch corporation in order to 
gain direct access to Shell shareholders with the hope of raising 
awareness of their concerns and demands.

<p>Shareholders entering the May 16 meeting will see miniature oil spills 
and gas flares brought by the campaigners to denounce the fact that gas 
flares and oil spills from Shell installations negatively affect people 
in Nigeria. They will be holding a banner saying: "Shell flares and 
spills, Nigerian people pay the bills".

<p>According to Adaka Inemo of Friends of the Earth Nigeria/ERA, "Shell 
must clean up its oil spills. It says it cleans them all up but this is 
an outright lie. The Oruma oil spillage of 25 June 2005 is a case in 
point. Shell is contemptuous of our laws, of our peoples and of our 
environment."

<p>"Shell was told twice by Nigerian courts to stop gas flaring but it 
plans to continue this economic and environmental monstrosity until at 
least 2009. It should instead respect Nigerian law and stop violating 
human rights," he added.

<p>On may 15, 2006, official complaints were filed by Brazilian and 
Filipino people affected by Shell - with the support of Friends of the 
Earth International and Friends of the Earth netherlands/Milieudefensie 
- at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) 
contact point in the Netherlands.
