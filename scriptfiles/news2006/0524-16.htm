WASHINGTON - May 24 - Over the past year, the statement that poverty in Venezuela has  increased under the government of President Hugo Ch&aacute;vez has appeared in scores of major newspapers, on  major television and radio programs, and even journals such as <em>Foreign  Affairs<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="" id="_ftnref1"> </a></em> and <em>Foreign Policy</em>.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="" id="_ftnref2"> </a> These statements have only rarely been contested or corrected. [See Appendix to  the paper  <a href="http://www.cepr.net/publications/venezuelan_poverty_rates_2006_05.pdf">http://www.cepr.net/publications/venezuelan_poverty_rates_2006_05.pdf</a>] for  samples of this misreporting on poverty in Venezuela].
<p align="left" class="regtext">An <em>Issue Brief</em> released by the Center for Economic and Policy  Research looks at the numbers and concludes:</p>
<ul>
  <li class="regtext">The  household poverty rate was thus reduced by nearly 5 percentage points, or 12.9  percent, from 42.8 percent in the first half of 1999 (when President Chavez took  office) to 37.9 percent in the second half of 2005.&nbsp; Since the economy has continued to grow rapidly this year (first  quarter growth came in at 9.4 percent), the poverty rate is almost certainly  significantly lower today.<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li class="regtext">There is no evidence  that the Venezuelan National Institute of Statistics has changed its  methodology, so these numbers are directly comparable. The most recent figures  are about what would be expected as a result of the rapid economic recovery.</li>
  <li>
    <p class="regtext">Most of the erroneous  reporting on this issue results from using numbers gathered in the first  quarter of 2004. These numbers reflect sharp increase in the poverty rate  caused by the severe economic downturn of 2002-2003.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p class="regtext">Since the preliminary  poverty numbers for 2005 were released in September 2005, it is not clear why  the out-of-date, early 2004 numbers have continued to be widely used. The early  2004 numbers quickly became out of date because of the rapid growth of the  Venezuelan economy in 2004 (17.9 percent) and 2005 (9.4 percent), which pulled  millions of people out of poverty.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p class="regtext">The&nbsp; reduction in poverty noted above, since  1999, measures only cash income. This, however, does not really capture the  changes in the living standards of the poor in Venezuela, since there have been  major changes in non-cash benefits and services in the last few years &ndash; for  example health care is now provided to an estimated 54 percent of the  population. The paper looks briefly at the impact of these changes.</p>
