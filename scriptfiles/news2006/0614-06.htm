<p>WASHINGTON - June 14 - Reversing environmental  degradation and reducing poverty in the developing world requires  working simultaneously across local, sub-national and national  levels, according to a new book by World Wildlife Fund's director  of macroeconomic policy, David Reed.</p>
<p>   The book, titled Escaping Poverty's Grasp: The Environmental  Foundations of Poverty Reduction, builds on WWF's long-standing  strength of working at the local level in vulnerable places  around the world and demonstrates how to extend that work to  influencing policies and institutions at sub-national and  national levels.  By providing compelling experiences in rural  areas of China, Indonesia, El Salvador, South Africa and Zambia,  the book highlights ways of opening economic opportunities and  improving natural resource management in the face of many  obstacles and self-interested groups that seek wealth by  controlling natural resources.</p>
<p>   The book offers a unique and powerful methodology, called the  3xM Approach, so-called because it cuts across the micro, meso  and macro levels of a given society to promote poverty reduction  and improved natural resource management.  This is designed to  arm local communities and civil society organizations as well as  international development agencies as they try to respond to the  many changes associated with globalization.  Frequently  globalization provides new opportunities to the dynamic, more  powerful groups in countries, often leaving the poor and the  environment to bear the costs of economic growth.  The 3xM  Approach provides tools to rural and urban groups alike to  understand the new economic and institutional impacts of  globalization and to engage in change processes that will protect  the environment and the rural communities that depend directly on  natural resources.</p>
<p>   &quot;For many years we have watched successful poverty-environment  initiatives at the local level being wiped out by powerful  interests groups and economic changes,&quot; said Reed.  &quot;We can now  offer an intervention approach that supports local changes by  reforms at higher policy levels and ensures the sustainability of  local economic initiatives and efforts to improve natural  resource management.&quot;</p>
<p>   Poverty is directly linked to environment because in many  rural areas, poor communities must depend on natural resources  for their survival. In the indigenous communities of Deqin County  in China for example, wood logging is a source of employment and  income. Wood is also used for fuel and construction. After a 1998  nature reserve expansion and a country-wide logging ban initiated  by the government, cash flow to the rural communities garnered  from these wood products dropped dramatically and local tensions  with nature reserve authorities increased.  By working with all  levels of government, a new system allowing the community to  collaborate in the management of the forests was developed.  This  system has enabled the communities to sustainable use non-timber  products and helped them to increase their income by six to ten  times.  By working with provincial and national authorities, a  means to apply this system in other parts of China was developed.</p>
<p>   &quot;WWF's work on poverty and environment examines concrete  activities to empower the poor, link poverty reduction and the  environment, and promote changes across the local, sub-national  and national levels of societies,&quot; said Louis Michel, EC  commissioner for development and humanitarian aid. &quot;This work  makes a number of solid policy recommendations for bringing about  enduring changes in rural livelihoods and resource management.&quot;</p>
<p>   Two events will be held in Washington, D.C. around the release  of the book:</p>
