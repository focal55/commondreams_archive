<P style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><STRONG>The 
Pentagon has its own domestic spying program. Even its leaders say the outfit 
may have gone too far.</STRONG> Late on a June afternoon in 2004, a motley group 
of about 10 peace activists showed up outside the Houston headquarters of 
Halliburton, the giant military contractor once headed by Vice President Dick 
Cheney. The demonstrators wore papier-mache masks and handed out free 
peanut-butter-and-jelly sandwiches to Halliburton employees as they left work. 
The idea, according to organizer Scott Parkin, was to call attention to 
allegations that the company was overcharging on a food contract for troops in 
Iraq. To U.S. Army analysts at the top-secret Counterintelligence Field Activity 
(CIFA), the peanut-butter protest was regarded as a potential threat to national 
security. A Defense document shows that Army analysts wrote a report on the 
Halliburton protest and stored it in CIFA's database. There are now questions 
about whether CIFA exceeded its authority and conducted unauthorized spying on 
innocent people and organizations. The deputy Defense secretary now acknowledges 
that...reports may have contained information on U.S. citizens and groups that 
never should have been retained. The number of reports with names of U.S. 
persons could be in the thousands, says a senior Pentagon official.</P>

the media covers the scandals surrounding Laci Peterson, the Runaway Bride or 
Michael Jackson, "there are no clicks then." With the departure from the screen 
of the "titans" — Tom Brokaw, Peter Jennings and Dan Rather — who "resisted the 
temptations of their bosses to go for the ratings grab, it will be years before 
an anchorman or anchorwoman will have the clout to fight these battles," he 
said. He's shocked "by how unkind our world has become." <STRONG>E-mail and talk

so vast in the province of Alberta that they will help solve America’s energy

<P style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">The best 
reporting of...climate change has come from Elizabeth Kolbert in the New Yorker. 
<STRONG>Her three-part series last spring lucidly explained the harbingers of 
potential disaster: a shrinking of Arctic sea ice by 250 million acres since 
1979; a thawing of the permafrost for what appears to be the first time in 
120,000 years; a steady warming of Earth's surface temperature; changes in 
rainfall patterns that could presage severe droughts of the sort that destroyed 
ancient civilizations.</STRONG> This month she published a new piece, "Butterfly 
Lessons," that looked at how these delicate creatures are moving into new 
habitats as the planet warms. Her real point was that all life, from 
microorganisms to human beings, will have to adapt, and in ways that could be 
dangerous and destabilizing. If people such as...Kolbert are right, we are all 
but ignoring the biggest story in the history of humankind. Kolbert concluded 
her series last year with this shattering thought: "It may seem impossible to 
imagine that a technologically advanced society could choose, in essence, to 
destroy itself, but that is what we are now in the process of doing." The 
failure of the United States to get serious about climate change is 
unforgivable, a human folly beyond imagining.</P>

Electrodes split the water into hydrogen and oxygen molecules. Hydrogen 
electrons pass through a conductor that creates the current to power an electric 
engine. <STRONG>Hydrogen fuel now costs two to three times as much as gasoline, 
but gets up to three times the mileage of gas, making the overall cost about the 
same. As an added benefit, there are no carbon emissions — only water 
vapor.</STRONG> By the middle of this century, all Icelanders will be required

<P style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">The boom of 
thunder and crackle of lightning generally mean one thing: a storm is coming. 
Curiously, though, the biggest storms of all, hurricanes, are notoriously 
lacking in lightning. Hurricanes blow, they rain, they flood, but seldom do they 
crackle. During the record-setting hurricane season of 2005, three of the most 
powerful storms--Rita, Katrina, and Emily--did have lightning, lots of it. And 
researchers would like to know why. Richard Blakeslee of the Global Hydrology 
and Climate Center (GHCC) in Huntsville, Alabama, was one of a team of 
scientists who explored Hurricane Emily. <STRONG>"Hurricanes are most likely to 
produce lightning when they're making landfall," says Blakeslee. But there were 
no mountains beneath the "electric hurricanes" of 2005—only flat water.</STRONG> 
It's tempting to think that, because Emily, Rita and Katrina were all 
exceptionally powerful, their sheer violence somehow explains their lightning. 
But Blakeslee says that this explanation is too simple. "Other storms have been 
equally intense and did not produce much lightning," he says. <STRONG>"There 
must be something else at work."</STRONG></P>

<P style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">This 
award-winning film provides an inside look at the anatomy of the American war 
machine. Why We Fight [was originally] the title of a series of propaganda films 
that Frank Capra began making in 1942, with the aim of encouraging the American 
war effort against Nazism. Director Eugene Jarecki (The Trials of Henry 
Kissinger) has used the films as a commentary on the contemporary obsession of 
the American elite with military power. He also harks back to a speech by 
President Eisenhower, who, just before he left office, referred to the 
"military-industrial complex". Eisenhower was worried that too much 
intelligence, and too much business acumen in America, had become focussed on 
the production of unnecessary weapons systems. Since Eisenhower's time, 
everything has become much worse, as Eugene Jarecki describes it. The war in 
Iraq was made possible by a new range of weapons systems: a bomb called the 
"bunker buster" was dropped by stealth bombers on the first night of the 
conflict. <STRONG>Is American foreign policy dominated by the idea of military 
supremacy? Has the military become too important in American life?</STRONG> 
Jarecki's shrewd and intelligent polemic would seem to give an affirmative 
answer to each of these questions.</P>
