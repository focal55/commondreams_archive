<p>WASHINGTON - August 15 - Under the Freedom of  Information Act (FOIA) Amnesty International and the  International Human Rights Clinic of New York University School  of Law jointly submitted requests to various federal departments  for records concerning &quot;disappeared&quot; detainees including &quot;ghost&quot;  and unregistered prisoners.  These detainees are individuals who  are-or have been-held by, or with the involvement of the United  States government, where there is no public record of the  detentions.  Such individuals have also often been subjected to  the practice commonly known as extraordinary rendition. </p>
<p>   &quot;Despite the evidence of secret sites and unlawful rendition  of suspects that Amnesty International, other NGOs and the media  have uncovered, the United States government has 'so far'  declined to discuss that such a program exists,&quot; said Curt  Goering, senior deputy executive director for Amnesty  International USA.  &quot;In addition, they decline to discuss secret  detention and the existence of 'black sites.' How many more  former detainees' testimonials, breaking stories and U.N.  condemnations will it take for the United States to end its worst  practices and abide by the rule of law?&quot; </p>
<p>   The FOIA requests were filed earlier this year to the U.S.  Departments of Justice, Defense, State, Homeland Security and the  Central Intelligence Agency.  Several responses have been  received, but they have provided very little information. </p>
<p>   &quot;We are certain that more records exist, and we hope that all  agencies involved will disclose the documents they hold,&quot; said  Margaret L. Satterthwaite, assistant professor of clinical law at  New York University School of Law and Amnesty International Board  member.  &quot;It is a violation of human rights to withhold  information about the fate and whereabouts of individuals  deprived of their liberty.  These FOIA requests are an attempt to  end that part of the violation and to force the U.S. government  to fully own up to its illegal actions.&quot; </p>
<p>   While Amnesty International has not yet received substantive  replies from all agencies with whom it filed FOIA requests, from  past experience Amnesty International expects to encounter  resistance in receiving all the information requested from the  U.S. government agencies. </p>
<p>   &quot;We are hopeful that it will not be necessary to take legal  action, however, the United States' continued defiance in not  providing the truth may not leave us any other option,&quot; said  Goering. </p>
<p>   Amnesty International is represented in this matter by the law  firm of Wilmer, Cutler, Pickering, Hale &amp; Dorr. </p>
