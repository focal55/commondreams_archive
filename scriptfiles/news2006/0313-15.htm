<p>WASHINGTON - March 13 - The East Timor and Indonesia Action Network (ETAN) today 
urged Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice to support an Indonesia 
policy that genuinely promotes justice, peace and human rights.

<p>"A forward-looking policy toward Indonesia would make clear that 
democracy requires more than fair elections. Secretary Rice should 
change her stance on Indonesia's security forces to make genuine 
accountability and real reform prerequisites for military 
assistance," said Karen Orenstein, National Coordinator of ETAN.

<p>"The Bush administration's proposal for a greater than six-fold 
increase in military aid to Indonesia for 2007 reveals the State 
Department's so-called 'carefully calibrated' approach toward aiding 
the Indonesian military to be nothing more than hollow rhetoric," 
said Orenstein. "This unwarranted gift will only set back reform."

<p>"By recklessly waiving restrictions on U.S. military assistance to 
Indonesia late last year, Secretary Rice abandoned the best available 
leverage to press for genuine reform," continued Orenstein. "If 
Secretary Rice is unwilling to withdraw the waiver, she should 
describe clear criteria to be met before the U.S. provides any 
foreign military financing and lethal equipment. Otherwise, the 
corrupt Indonesian military will correctly perceive any U.S. 
assistance as an endorsement of business-as-usual."

<p>"Such benchmarks should include Indonesia's acceptance of the UN 
Commission of Experts recommendation that it cooperate with 
international efforts to prosecute senior figures for massive human 
rights violations in East Timor. A pledge to broadly circulate and 
discuss the findings of the report of the East Timor Commission for 
Reception, Truth and Reconciliation should be another marker," said 
John M. Miller, National Coordinator of ETAN. "Such a call would have 
added credibility if the U.S. government made a similar commitment."

<p>"West Papua has been long-neglected by the international community. 
Secretary Rice should use her visit to highlight ongoing human rights 
violations and question the military build-up there. She should press 
Jakarta to heed calls from West Papua for demilitarization and a fair 
share of the income from its resources, and demand that Indonesia 
fully open West Papua to the outside world," said Orenstein.

<p>"Secretary Rice should additionally investigate and take 
responsibility for the alleged poor rights record of Detachment 88, 
the anti-terrorism police unit created and funded by the U.S. 
government," stated Orenstein.

<p>Last November, the Department of State issued a waiver removing all 
remaining congressional restrictions on U.S. military assistance to 
Indonesia. Congress had imposed various restrictions on military 
assistance for Indonesia since 1992.

<p>The Commission for Reception, Truth and Reconciliation called on 
countries to make military assistance to Indonesia "totally 
conditional on progress towards full democratisation, the 
subordination of the military to the rule of law and civilian 
government, and strict adherence with international human rights..."

<p>ETAN advocates for democracy, justice and human rights for East Timor 
and Indonesia. ETAN calls for an international tribunal to prosecute 
crimes against humanity committed in East Timor from 1975 to 1999 and 
for continued restrictions on U.S. military assistance to Indonesia 
until there is genuine reform of its security forces. For additional
