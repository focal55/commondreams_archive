<p>GENEVA, Switzerland - July 29 - Since hostilities began on 12 July, the conflict has displaced huge numbers of people. While phone lines are generally working, allowing families to keep in touch, the number of people inside and outside Lebanon trying to find their relatives is increasing as the conflict continues.


<p>Today, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) launched a special webpage to help those seeking to re-establish contact with their relatives. The service is available to people in the conflict area and throughout the world.

<p>People in the conflict area can register to announce that they are safe, while those looking for people in the conflict area can check the list for the names and contact details of relatives with whom they have lost contact.

<p>Both in the conflict area and elsewhere, people can also register the names of people with whom they have lost touch

<p>The page is in English and Arabic, and can be accessed via <a href="http://www.familylinks.icrc.org" target="_new">www.familylinks.icrc.org</a>.

<p>This system is managed by the ICRC in cooperation with the tracing services of National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. The ICRC has no means of verifying the information sent via the site and cannot accept responsibility for any inaccurate information.

<p>Furthermore, the information given on the website is not confidential – anyone can read it. It is the responsibility of those registering to ensure that no harm is caused by registration. Neither the ICRC nor any other component of the Red Cross/Red Crescent Movement can accept responsibility for any consequences to an individual arising from registration.

<p>For any further information, members of the public should contact their nearest Red Cross or Red Crescent office.

<p>People who have re-established contact and therefore wish their names to be removed from the list should follow the instructions on the webpage.
