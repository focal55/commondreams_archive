<p>WASHINGTON, DC—On Friday, June 2, as Wal-Mart convenes its annual shareholders meeting, thousands of concerned citizens in hazmat suits, face shields and rubber gloves will attempt to "quarantine" Wal-Mart locations across the country.

 

<p>This "Bureau of Workers Health" organized by Jobs with Justice and the Ruckus Society will be armed with yellow caution tape, health hazard signs, and "Notices of Quarantine."

 

<p>30 actions are planned nationwide.  In Bentonville, AK, low-income residents from across the state will serve Notices of Quarantine to Wal-Mart shareholders as they come in and out of the meeting, directly confronting them about their company's policies.  In Cleveland, OH, residents will quarantine a controversial proposed Wal-Mart sited on a toxic waste dump.  In Mountain View, CA, 80-year-old members of the Raging Grannies will sing and dance outside a super-center.

 

<p>The quarantine will focus on Wal-Mart's failure to provide health care to a majority of its employees, an issue currently in the media spotlight.  In January, Maryland passed a law compelling Wal-Mart to improve its health care benefits.  Now, over 20 other states are considering similar legislation.

 

<p>"It is outrageous that the largest corporation in the world has full-time workers who are forced to enroll in Medicaid at tax-payers expense," said Jobs with Justice Director, Fred Azcarate.  The average pay for a Wal-Mart sales associate is $1,000 below the poverty line for a family of three. Company employees top Medicaid rolls in at least 16 states.
