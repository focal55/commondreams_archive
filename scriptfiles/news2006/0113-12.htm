<p>WASHINGTON - January 13 - The following can be attributed to Caroline Fredrickson, Director of the ACLU 
Washington Legislative Office:
<P>"If this provision is adopted, our precious First Amendment would be 
significantly curtailed. The Secret Service already has broad authority to 
stifle dissent at events where high-ranking public officials appear. This 
little-noticed provision, contained in legislation meant to reauthorize the 
Patriot Act, would give the Secret Service effective power to enact &#8216;exclusion 
zones&#8217; even without the attendance of the president or other Secret Service 
protectee.</P>
<P>"Imagine, in the future, a pro-choice president is set to speak at a 
conference, which the Secret Service declares as an &#8216;event of national 
significance.&#8217; If the bill passes, the Secret Service could shut down areas 
throughout the conference and arrest any pro-life protester who violates the 
zone for a felony. This could happen even at times when the president is not 
speaking.</P>
<P>"Congress has not had ample time to consider this attack on the First 
Amendment. While there remains much to do on the Patriot Act powers themselves, 
lawmakers must reject this assault on the right to dissent."</P>
