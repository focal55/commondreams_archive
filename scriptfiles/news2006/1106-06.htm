<p>WASHINGTON - November 6 - Amnesty  International called on Pakistan's government to ensure the  safety of Abdur Rahim Muslim Dost, who was arrested without a  warrant on September 29 in Peshawar and whose whereabouts are now  unknown. The organization believes the Afghan poet and magazine  editor is at risk of torture.</p>
<p>   Because of the urgency of Dost's plight, Amnesty International  recently issued an Urgent Action on his behalf, mobilizing its  more than 1.8 million members worldwide to press for his safety  and demand that his location be revealed.</p>
<p>   &quot;Abdur Rahim Muslim Dost is a brave voice of dissent against  Pakistani human rights violations in the U.S.-led war on terror,&quot;  said Larry Cox, Amnesty International USA Executive Director.  &quot;Pakistani authorities have arrested this courageous man in an  attempt to silence him. The international community must raise  its voice to Pakistan's government to help make sure that Dost is  not tortured or ill-treated.&quot;</p>
<p>   Pakistani agencies had earlier arbitrarily arrested, detained  and unlawfully transferred Dost and his brother to U.S. custody.</p>
<p>   On September 29, 2006, Dost was arrested by officers of  Pakistan's Crime Investigation Department as he left a mosque in  Peshawar. His children and elder brother, Sayed Mohammad, were  present. Dost has not been charged with a criminal offense and  has not been brought before a magistrate. In addition, he has not  been allowed to see a lawyer or his family.</p>
<p>   Sayed Mohammad filed a habeas corpus petition on October 5 in  Peshawar's High Court. The court has asked the federal and  provincial authorities for information about Dost's whereabouts.  The petition also seeks assurances from the court that he will  not be removed from its territorial jurisdiction.</p>
<p>   Dost has lived in Peshawar for several years. On November 17,  2001, he and his younger brother, Badruzzaman Badr, were arrested  by military authorities at their home in Peshawar. They were  handed over to the U.S. authorities on February 8, 2002, and held  at the U.S. airbase in Bagram and then Kandahar, Afghanistan,  before being transferred to the U.S.- controlled detention center  in Guantanamo Bay on May 1, 2002. Badruzzaman Badr was released  from Guantanamo Bay on September 24, 2004; Dost was freed on  April 20, 2005. Neither brother had been charged with any offense  during his unlawful detention.</p>
<p>   The brothers returned to their home in Peshawar and in  September 2006 published a book about their experiences, Da  Guantanamo Mati Zolani (&quot;The Broken Shackles of Guantanamo&quot;).  This book is reportedly critical of the Pakistani intelligence  agencies' role in the pursuit of the war on terror and describes  the brothers' torture in Pakistani and U.S. custody. Badruzzaman  Badr has gone into hiding, fearing a fate similar to that of his  brother.</p>
<p>   &quot;Abdur Rahim Muslim Dost's detention is only the latest in a  long and atrocious series,&quot; said T. Kumar, Amnesty International  USA Advocacy Director for Asia and the Pacific. &quot;Pakistani  complicity in the U.S.-led war on terror has involved several  hundred 'disappearances.' As Amnesty International has  documented, detainees have been arrested and held incommunicado  at secret locations, with the authorities denying that they're  being held. This is all in clear violation of international human  rights standards as well as Pakistani law.&quot;</p>
<p>   The clandestine nature of the war on terror makes it  impossible to know exactly how many 'disappearances' or other  arbitrary detentions have been committed in Pakistan, but  Pakistani military spokesperson Major-General Shaukat Sultan said  in June 2006 that since 2001, some 1,000 terrorists had been  arrested.</p>
<p>   &quot;The Pakistani government is eager to be seen as contributing  to the aims of the war on terror,&quot; said Cox. &quot;That, along with  the routine U.S. practice of offering rewards running to  thousands of dollars for the handover of unidentified terror  suspects, has encouraged illegal detentions and  'disappearances.'&quot;</p>
