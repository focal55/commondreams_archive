<p>WASHINGTON - September 25 - A broad coalition of stakeholder groups issued a statement today criticizing the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s plan for responding to a U.S. outbreak of bird flu and called for revisions to adequately protect the public and poultry farmers.  The coalition charged that the USDA does not acknowledge the risk posed by common poultry industry practices in the emergence and spread of highly-pathogenic avian influenza.</p><p>"The USDA is incorrectly focusing its attention on small and free-range poultry farmers," said Wenonah Hauter, executive director of Food &amp; Water Watch.</p><p>The USDA does not address industry practices that increase the risk of spreading avian influenza. "Not only are big poultry producers housing hundreds of thousands of birds, they're moving birds, feed, and supplies and even poultry waste to be used as fertilizer or to be fed to other animals," explained Hauter.</p><p>"Poultry workers and growers would be among the first exposed to an outbreak but USDA does not ensure appropriate protective equipment, specialized sanitation, training, human flu vaccinations and whistleblower protections for workers who detect and report sick birds " said Mark Lauritsen of the United Food &amp; Commercial Workers.</p><p>The plan does not address the potentially huge economic impacts for small processors and the vulnerability of the many workers at large plants if quarantines or depopulation eliminate the supply of poultry. "The current USDA plan provides for compensation of the large poultry companies that own birds. Meanwhile, farm workers and farmers who contract with the companies are left completely vulnerable and stand to lose their entire livelihood,” said Andrea Whiteis, National Poultry Justice Alliance Director.   <br /></p><p>The coalition representing consumers, organic, minority and family farmers, ranchers, animal welfare advocates, contract poultry growers, poultry workers, unions, environmentalists, religious groups, social justice organizations and concerned citizens called on USDA’s Animal Plant Health Inspection Service to take the following steps:<br /></p><ul><li>Protect the health and livelihoods of all poultry workers and growers;</li><li>Follow the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) euthanasia guidelines when destroying flocks;</li><li>Improve procedures for venting, dust control, and transportation and disposal of bird carcasses and waste; and</li><li>Extend testing, enforce immediate quarantines, and notify the facilities' neighbors if disease is detected.</li></ul><p> <a href="http://www.foodandwaterwatch.org/food/avian-flu/usda-should-revise-avian-flu-plan-coalition-statement" target="_self">The complete statement is available in online</a>
