<p>WASHINGTON - July 27 - 
 
 
  


“The Voting Rights Act (VRA) has been our biggest line of defense against voter discrimination for more than 40 years. With President Bush’s reauthorization today, we are hopeful that the President will continue to work with Congress to increase everyone’s confidence in the voting booth.

<p>“With his signature, the President followed Congress’ lead in protecting key provisions of the VRA set to expire this year.

<p>“For nearly half a century these provisions have eliminated hurdles to voting for African Americans, Hispanics, Asian Americans, Native Americans, and other minority groups. The VRA is often celebrated as one of the most successful pieces of civil rights legislation in our history.

<p>“Reauthorizing the VRA is a positive step toward protecting the right to vote for all Americans, but our work is far from finished. The President should take this opportunity to continue to work in a bipartisan way to improve our laws so that all Americans can have confidence that their vote counts.”
