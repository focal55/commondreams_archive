<p>PHILADELPHIA - May 23 - American Friends Service Committee (AFSC), the National Network for Immigrant and Refugee Rights (NNIRR), grassroots, regional and national partners throughout the United States will conduct concurrent press conferences on Wednesday, May 24, 2006.   AFSC believes that current U.S. immigration policy is badly broken and in need of reform. We support true comprehensive immigration reform.  For more than twenty years, our government has pursued an unworkable path to reducing the level of undocumented immigration. We've poured billions into harsher penalties, more deportation, increased technology and border patrol officers, and more detention facilities -- all without reducing the level of undocumented immigration.

<p>Legislative measures that are currently being considered do not address the root causes of migration, create an apartheid-type, multi-tiered legalization process, expand enforcement, detention and deportation actions and eliminate core elements of our nation’s legal system, including due process under the law.
