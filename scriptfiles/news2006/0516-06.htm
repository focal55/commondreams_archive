<p>WASHINGTON - May 16 - Earlier today, Citizens  for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) filed a  complaint with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) alleging  that two former staffers for Senator Rick Santorum (R-PA)  violated several provisions of the Federal Election Campaign Act  (FECA). CREW also sent a copy of the complaint to the U.S.  Attorney for the Western District of Pennsylvania for possible  investigation.</p>
<p>   In late April, The Philadelphia Inquirer reported that John  Dick and Joseph Kuklis, who handled business outreach in  Santorum's Pittsburgh office, left the Senator to open up their  own lobbying shop, GSP Consulting Corp. (GSP), in the same  building where Sen. Santorum maintains his Pittsburgh office. GSP  started a political action committee (PAC) and landed $35 million  in appropriations by acting as middlemen between clients and the  Pennsylvania congressional delegation.</p>
<p>   GSP Consulting and the law firm of Houston Harbaugh formed a  joint venture, Houston Harbaugh Legislative Services (HHLS). Both  GSP and HHLS created PACs, but neither reported the affiliation  in any FEC filing.</p>
<p>   The alleged violations include:</p>
<p>   -- Dick contributed $14,000 and Kuklis contributed $11,800 to  GSP-PAC in violation of the FECA, which limits PAC contributions  to $5,000.</p>
<p>   -- GSP-PAC may have violated the FECA by soliciting a  contribution from someone not employed by or a family member of  someone employed by GSP.</p>
<p>   -- HHLS-PAC may have violated the FECA by soliciting  contributions from Dick and Kuklis, who were not employed by or  family members of anyone employed by HHLS.</p>
<p>   -- In The Philadelphia Inquirer, Dick was quoted as saying  that he tells his clients to contribute money to federal  candidates. Using corporate resources to facilitate contributions  to candidates violates the FECA.</p>
<p>   Melanie Sloan, executive director of CREW, said &quot;Lobbyists  need to learn that following campaign finance law is not  optional. Dick and Kuklis blatantly and repeatedly violated the  law and should be subjected to the appropriate sanctions. We look  forward to the FEC's prompt investigation of this matter.&quot;</p>
