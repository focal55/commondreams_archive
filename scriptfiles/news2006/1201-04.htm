<p>WASHINGTON - December 1 - <p>Addis Ababa, Ethiopia - U.S. Senator Russ Feingold (D-WI) released 
          the following statement today about World AIDS Day. Feingold is traveling 
          this week through Kenya and Ethiopia, two countries heavily impacted 
          by HIV/AIDS. <br>
          <br><i>
          &quot;This year, on World AIDS Day, we are reminded of the rapidly rising 
          rate of HIV/AIDS and its devastating impact on communities around the 
          world. The global AIDS epidemic has claimed the lives of more than 25 
          million people, and 40 million people are currently living with HIV. 
          Despite recent advances in HIV/AIDS treatment, more resources must be 
          devoted to addressing the disproportionate impact of AIDS, particularly 
          in the developing world. Africa has been particularly plagued by devastating 
          HIV/AIDS infection rates. During my travels this week in Kenya and Ethiopia, 
          I heard immense appreciation for the President&#8217;s successful PEPFAR 
          program. It has become clear that we can only defeat the epidemic by 
          aggressively pursuing a combination of efforts, including broader access 
          to good and affordable health care, prevention education, and increasing 
          the number of health care workers in impoverished nations. We must work 
          together to address this global epidemic in order to prevent future 
          cases of HIV/AIDS and improve the quality of life and lifespan for those 
          people living with HIV/AIDS.&quot; </i></p>
        <p>Senator Feingold is the incoming chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations 
          Committee Sub-committee on Africa and is the co-chair of the CSIS HIV/AIDS 
        Task Force with Senator Bill Frist (R-TN). </p>
