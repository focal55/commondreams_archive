<p>WASHINGTON - August 8 - One year after the  Administration's energy policy was signed into law, consumers are  paying record high prices for gas and the majority of the cost  increases have turned into profits for domestic oil companies. </p>
<p>   "As gasoline prices and oil industry profits hit record high  levels, so too has public frustration and concern," said Ann  Wright, senior policy analyst for Consumers Union. "The oil  companies continue to be the largest benefactors of our nation's  energy policy -- not the American public."</p>
<p>   "Time to Change the Record in Energy Policy," a report  released today by the Consumer Federation of America (CFA) and  Consumers Union (CU) shows the following:</p>
<p>   -- The increase in the domestic refiner/market spread -- the  amount oil companies take for domestic refining and marketing --  since last summer is about 34 cents per gallon, which is more  than the increase in crude oil costs (about 31 cents).  </p>
<p>   -- This increase in the domestic spread adds about $12 billion  to summer driving costs for consumers.  </p>
<p>   -- Compared to 2002, the last time summer gasoline sold at  $1.50 per gallon, domestic crude and refining/marketing have  accounted for an 85-cent increase in the price of gasoline.   </p>
<p>   "Because the price increases are not driven by costs, oil  industry profits have skyrocketed," Mark Cooper, CFA's director  of research, said. "Oil companies will make more money this year  than they did in 1995 to 1999 combined. Comparing oil industry  profits to the Standard and Poors Industrial, the industry will  have $120 billion in excess profits in the 2001 - 2006  period. Cash flow has increased so fast that the industry simply  cannot absorb it. Cash flow has exceeded net new investment by  $120 billion, yet, Congress continues to lavish favors on the  industry."</p>
<p>   The report points out that the recently passed legislation to  expand drilling in environmentally sensitive coastal areas will  do little to lower prices or free our nation from its addiction  to oil.</p>
<p>   -- About 85 percent of the oil in coastal areas is already  available for drilling.  </p>
<p>   -- The small increment of oil to be drilled in the new areas  constitutes less than 2 percent of global reserves.  </p>
<p>   "The drilling legislation will fatten the oil industry's  bottom line, since the oil companies will find 'cheap' oil, but  charge the world price," Cooper said.   </p>
<p>   "While the Administration and Congressional leadership  continue to push traditional supply-side strategies by promoting  drilling, many of the policies we have been advocating for years  are garnering bipartisan support. Congress and the Administration  should turn their attention to enacting a meaningful energy plan  that includes strong efficiency standards and better oversight of  the price raising practices of industry," Wright said.  </p>
<p>   The report points out that members from both sides of the  aisle have cosponsored important proposals to:  </p>
<p>   -- cut oil consumption and imports by as much as 10 million  barrels per day (almost 40 percent) over the next quarter  century; </p>
<p>   -- dramatically increase auto and truck fuel economy  standards; </p>
<p>   -- require the Environmental Protection Agency to update miles  per gallon estimates on new vehicle window stickers and require  manufacturers to use accurate estimates in compliance with  federal mileage standards; </p>
<p>   -- make mileage information readily accessible on new car  stickers, in advertising and even on real-time dashboard displays  during driving; </p>
<p>   -- empower antitrust and commodity market regulators to  scrutinize the price raising business practices of the oil  industry and commodity speculators </p>
<p>   "These aggressive efficiency measures will 'deliver' five to  10 times as much capacity to the oil market as the drilling bills  recently passed by the House and Senate," Cooper noted, "and fuel  economy-driven oil savings are sustainable for the long term,  while the small increase in production that results from expanded  drilling is not."</p>
<p>   The report notes that the results of a recent CFA-sponsored  public opinion poll indicate that people are ready for a change  in energy policy. According to the results, based on a random  national sample: </p>
<p>   -- Over three-quarters of respondents support requiring major  increases in the fuel efficiency of cars, requiring auto  companies to boost alternative fuel vehicles from 3 percent to 25  percent of the new car fleet, and making mileage information more  readily available as well. </p>
<p>   "Hopefully, if the members of Congress get an earful from  their constituents during the summer recess, the Congressional  leadership will feel the heat and give these important efficiency  measures and consumer protection bills votes when they return in  September," Wright concluded.  </p>
