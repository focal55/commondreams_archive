<p>WASHINGTON - January 26 - "Most people wouldn't think Pootie Tang and Robocop in the same thought - but they both made our list," said Russell Mokhiber, editor or Corporate Crime Reporter.


<p>Corporate Crime Reporter began compiling the list of corporate crime movies after receiving inquiries from college professors and high school teachers looking for movies about corporate crime.


<p>
<ul>
<li>The list was compiled by consulting with experts in the field of white collar and corporate crime.</li>
<li>Seventeen of the 50 movies are documentaries.</li>
<li>About 80 nominated films were pared down to the 50 selected for the list.</li>
</ul>
<p>"Given the rich history of corporate crime and violence in this country, I would say that movie-makers have just begun to scratch the surface," Mokhiber said.


<p>He predicted an uptick in corporate crime movies - both Hollywood and documentary - in the coming years.


<p>"People are deeply suspicious of corporate America, and movie makers are likely to rush in and fill the void," Mokhiber said.<p><b>The Top 50 Corporate Crime Movies are:
