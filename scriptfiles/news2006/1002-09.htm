<p>WASHINGTON - October 2 - The Human Rights Campaign, in conjunction with Delivery Agent Inc., the leader in shopping-enabled programming for television shows, motion pictures, sports and music videos, announced today a one-of-a-kind auction to benefit the programs of the nation’s largest gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender rights organization. The auction will feature the wardrobe worn by the stars of 2005’s hit movie Brokeback Mountain — the unforgettable Focus Features film directed by Academy Award winner Ang Lee.

<p>The first outfit from the film will be offered in a live auction on Saturday, Oct. 7 at the Human Rights Campaign’s 10th Annual National Dinner held in Washington, D.C. The remainder of the wardrobe seen on the actors in the film will be available for bidding in an online auction Oct. 13-20 on the new entertainment and e-commerce site <a href="http://www.seenon.com">www.seenon.com</a>.

<p>Focus Features and James Schamus, producer of Brokeback Mountain, have donated wardrobe from the film to be auctioned off; all proceeds benefit the Human Rights Campaign.

<p>“Brokeback Mountain was a truly epic film that inspired thousands of conversations about the lives of gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender Americans,” said HRC President Joe Solmonese. “For the Human Rights Campaign to be the beneficiary of an auction featuring part of Hollywood history is remarkable. We are excited to be a part of this one-of-a-kind auction and thrilled that the money raised will continue to go toward promoting and securing equality for all Americans.”

<p>“To be able to offer such a groundbreaking entertainment property to a broader audience is truly a great opportunity. Today’s expanded technologies and e-commerce platforms have opened the doors not only to enhance a consumer’s experience to connect with the entertainment world, but also to raise money for worthy causes such as HRC,” said Mike Fitzsimmons, CEO of Delivery Agent.
