<p>WASHINGTON - April 5 - Amnesty International today released a new report documenting how the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) used private aircraft operators and front companies to preserve the secrecy of rendition flights and "black site" detention.

<p>The report, Below the Radar: Secret flights to Torture and 'Disappearance', reveals how the CIA exploited aviation practices to hide behind the identity of private plane operators and circumvent authorities. Countries that allow CIA planes to cross their airspace and use their airports often cite the Convention on International Civil Aviation, also known as the Chicago Convention. These states claim that they do not have the authority to question the reasons for the flight because there is a clause in the Convention that allows private, non-commercial flights to fly over a country, or make technical stops there, without prior authorization or notification.  However, the Convention makes clear that every nation has the right to require inspection if there are "reasonable grounds to conclude that it (the aircraft) is being used for any purpose inconsistent with the aims of the convention."  Given that rendition violates international law, and there are many credible reports of such practices, countries have the right - and duty - to stop any aircraft on "reasonable grounds" of suspicion.

<p>The report also details dozens of destinations around the world where planes associated with rendition flights landed and took off. In addition, the report lists the private airlines with permission to land at U.S. military bases worldwide.

<p>"Are there any laws that the U.S. government will not break to continue its practice of denying people their human rights in the name of national security?" said Dr. William F. Schulz, Amnesty International USA's Executive Director. "The covert nature of the rendition operation has made it impossible to know how many persons have been abducted, transferred across borders, held in secret detention or tortured in the 'war on terror.' The bottom line is that secretly sending individuals to unknown locations where they are likely to be tortured or treated inhumanly is unlawful, and the CIA must stop."

<p>The transfer of any detainee to another country must take place with proper safeguards, including judicial oversight, and the use of official aircrafts.

<p>Three Yemeni men recently released after a two-year rendition ordeal have provided Amnesty International with new information about "black site" detention, which raises the possibility that they were held somewhere in eastern Europe or Central Asia. Their ordeal is outlined in an earlier Amnesty International report, Secret Detention in CIA 'Black Sites', November 2005.

<p>Muhammad Al-Assad, Muhammad Bashmilah and Salah 'Ali Qaru spent 13 months in one secret facility before being flown to Yemen in May 2005 and eventually released in late March 2006. "The men's captors worked very hard to conceal every aspect of detention but our research assessing information about climate, prayer schedules and flight times suggests that these men may have been held in Eastern Europe or Central Asia," said Schulz.

<p>Rendition is the extralegal transfer of people from one country to another in ways that bypass all judicial and administrative oversight. Since September 11, 2001, Amnesty International believes that the United States government has rendered perhaps hundreds of individuals for the purposes of interrogation and detention to countries with dubious human rights records. Mounting evidence suggests that rendition is part of an elaborate clandestine detention regime that includes the use of "black sites" and "disappearances," as well as torture and inhuman treatment.

<p>Amnesty International is calling on the aviation sector to immediately stop secret rendition flights and governments to stop facilitating the practice of rendition and receiving rendition victims.

<p>"Rendering people to countries with a proven record of torture -- as documented by the U.S. State Department -- violates U.S. and international law as well as core principles of justice. Amnesty International is urging Congress to create an independent commission to investigate all aspects of U.S. detention and interrogation practices," added Schulz.

1.    Estimated numbers of rendition victims:
The Egyptian prime minister noted in 2005 that the United States has transferred some 60-70 detainees to Egypt alone, and a former CIA agent with experience in the region believes that "hundreds" of detainees may have been sent by the U.S. to prisons in Middle Eastern countries. The United States has acknowledged the capture of about 30 "high value" detainees whose whereabouts remain unknown, and the CIA is reportedly investigating some three dozen additional cases of "erroneous rendition," in which people were detained based on flawed evidence or confusion over names
