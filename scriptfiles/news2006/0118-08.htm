<p>SPRINGFIELD, Illinois - January 18 - &quot;A big thumbs up to Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich, who  used today's State of the State address to make it clear that  he'll continue to stand up for the families and children of  Illinois, and stand up to the gun lobby.  
<p>   &quot;Along with Chicago Mayor Richard Daley and many state  legislators, Governor Blagojevich has made it clear that  protecting our children from AK-47s and Uzis is more important  than currying the political favor of the gun lobby.  The Governor  has chosen to side with the angels, and the people of  Illinois should be very grateful.</p>
<p>   &quot;The Brady Campaign was honored to have two of our activists,  Tom Vanden Berk and Jennifer Bishop, be invited as special guests  of the Governor, along with our great friend Thom Mennard  from the Illinois Council against Handgun Violence.  Governor  Blagojevich has pledged he'll fight to keep Illinois familes  safe -- and we promise we'll join him in that fight.&quot; </p>
