<p>WASHINGTON - February 7 - Until rainfall can produce an adequate harvest, populations in East Africa face a serious risk of hunger and malnutrition, warns Action Against Hunger International, which has operations in southeast Ethiopia (Somali region), in northeast Kenya, and in southern Somalia. Drought only worsens an already difficult context.

 

<p><b>Survival is difficult for fragile and sometimes isolated populations.<br>
</b>Because they are nomadic, most families in these areas depend on their cattle for food and livelihoods. The hostile environment, minimal infrastructures, and insecurity due to armed ethnic struggles contribute to a very difficult context. Balance is always precarious because local populations rely on two rain seasons a year (Gu from April to June, and Derg from October to December). 

 

<p><b>Lack of water causes increasing anxiety.
<br>
</b>Water is essential for both humans and animals, and is crucial for agriculture and pastures. Unfortunately, these regions have suffered through two consecutive deficient rain seasons (three in northern Kenya). During dry seasons, herders customarily drive their cattle in search of water and pastures, but now they are compelled to search much farther afield. These long walks through dry land jeopardize the health of both herders and animals. And inevitably, the remaining areas with adequate water could quickly suffer from saturation and depletion.

 

<p><b>The worst is expected for this region, which faces alarming vulnerabilities.
<br>
</b>Recent irregular rain seasons have resulted in a worsened humanitarian situation, affecting humans and animals. Nomads who have lost half their livestock will need an estimated three to five years to rebuild their herds. In Somalia, crops have failed to germinate, so farmers have lost their investment in seeds, which has reduced supplies of fodder for animals, food for the next six months (until the next crop), and seeds for the next planting season. For the past several weeks, mortality among animals and acute malnutrition among children have increased. Humanitarian needs can only rise until the expected rains of April. And then, if adequate rainfall fails to materialize, the perilous situation will become disastrous.

 

<p><b>Building on first-hand involvement with the area, Action Against Hunger teams are developing emergency responses. </b>
<p><b>A necessary but complex intervention.
<br>
</b>Action Against Hunger’s relief programs are designed according to each community’s situation, and they will evolve in the coming months when the dry season advances and men and animals are moving. In addition to the lack of infrastructure that makes access to these populations difficult, the programs must take into account such variables as food availability in local markets, insecurity, and the limits of established survival mechanisms.

 

 

 

 

 

<p><b>Northern Kenya and its borders seem to be the most seriously endangered areas due to three consecutive insufficient rain seasons.<br>
</b>Acute malnutrition rates have increased since December at Action Against Hunger’s nutritional centers in Mandera. Today, 2,000 children are receiving treatment. In response, Action Against Hunger will:

<p>
<ul>
<li>open new supplementary feeding centers; </li>
<li>distribute water, rehabilitate wells, and improve sanitation for 54,000 beneficiaries.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Ethiopia’s Somali region suffers chiefly from a lack of water.<br>
</b>Migrations in search of water have begun and should increase. Action Against Hunger has had relief programs in the area since 1996, but it will expand emergency activities in the Korahaï district with:

<p>
<ul>
<li>water distribution for 5,000 families; </li>
<li>veterinary treatment of cattle of 150,000 animals owned by 6,000 families. </li>
</ul>
<p><b>In southern Somalia’s Bakool region, the past year’s drought has forced populations to reduce their herds of livestock and diversify into agriculture. <br>
</b>Action Against Hunger has improved water access and supported agricultural diversification in the area since 2002. Increasing needs, however, are being analyzed to implement additional emergency programs.

 

<p><i>Action Against Hunger asks the international community to support its efforts in this difficult situation. Donations can be mailed to Action Against Hunger, 247 West 37th Street, Suite 1210, New York, NY 10018 or emailed via our website <a href="http://www.actionagainsthunger.org">www.actionagainsthunger.org</a>.
