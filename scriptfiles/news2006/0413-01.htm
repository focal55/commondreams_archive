<p>WASHINGTON - April 13 - American taxpayers will pay more than $1.2 billion to clean up after polluters at Superfund toxic waste sites across the country in 2006, according to a new analysis released today by the U.S. Public Interest Research Group.  This marks the 11th year that taxpayers will pay to protect the health of the one in four Americans living within four miles of a Superfund site instead of polluters paying as the program intended. 

 

<p>Superfund’s polluter pays fees once collected money from polluters to clean toxic waste sites. New data complied by U.S. PIRG reveals that, since these fees expired in 1995, the cost to taxpayers to clean up after polluters at toxic waste sites has increased by 427%.

 

<p>“On April 17th Americans will pay our taxes, but polluters will be once again excused from paying theirs,” said U.S. PIRG staff attorney Alex Fidis. “By refusing to reinstate the polluter fees, the federal government has opted to charge regular taxpayers, instead of polluters, for the costs of toxic waste cleanups,” said Fidis. 

 

<p>U.S. PIRG’s data reveals that since 2004, American taxpayers have paid $3.8 billion to clean up after polluters. Despite this heavy reliance on taxpayer funding, without the income provided by the polluter pays fees, the Superfund program does not receive enough money to adequately protect public health from toxic waste sites.

 

<p>While Superfund cleanup needs grow, program financing remains stagnant, creating funding shortfalls that delay critical toxic cleanups and jeopardize public health. In 2005, the EPA cleaned only 40 sites, a significant departure from the average of 77 sites cleaned each year between 1992 and 2000. If funding shortfalls persist, the number of toxic sites cleaned will continue to drop. 

 

<p>Congressman Frank Pallone (D-NJ) has introduced legislation (H.R. 3584) to reinstate Superfund’s polluter fees. If restored, the polluter fees would provide a dedicated and reliable source of cleanup money and shift the costs of toxic cleanups from taxpayers back to polluters.

 

<p>“At a time of record budget deficits, the exclusive use of scarce taxpayer dollars to cleanup after irresponsible businesses is fiscally reckless and amounts to nothing more than polluter welfare,” said Fidis. “Congressman Pallone’s legislation would compel polluters to pay their fair share and alleviate the burden on taxpayers, while providing a much needed increase in funding to support Superfund’s important cleanup goals.”
