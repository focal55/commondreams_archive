<p>WASHINGTON - September 6 - Larry Cox, Amnesty  International USA's executive director, made the following  statement in response to news reports regarding President Bush's  new detainee policy, the new directives and the revised Army  Field Manual issued by the U.S. Department of Defense:</p>
<p>   &quot;Amnesty International welcomes many key provisions of the new  Army Field Manual and Department of Defense Directive 2310.01E.  By announcing adherence to Common Article 3 of the Geneva  Conventions for all detainees the Pentagon has reaffirmed  important protections found in international law. We are also  pleased to see a direct repudiation of tactics previously  approved for use against detainees such as hooding, the use of  dogs and temperature manipulation, as well as a repudiation of  extreme techniques such as waterboarding.</p>
<p>   However, Amnesty International remains concerned that these  documents continue to put forth a broad definition of what  constitutes an 'unlawful enemy combatant' in an effort to extend  the law of war framework globally. By applying this framework to  people detained far from any armed conflict, the administration  is turning the law of war on its head and using it to swallow the  applicable human rights framework.</p>
<p>   Amnesty International welcomes the announcement that the  administration intends to transfer people out of secret prisons  into acknowledged DOD facilities. Bringing one or more of these  so-called 'high value detainees' to trial for alleged war crimes  or crimes against humanity is an important step in achieving  accountability. However, any trial must preserve fundamental fair  trial protections including the right to be present at one's  trial and the exclusion of evidence obtained through torture or  other ill treatment or coercion.</p>
<p>   The transfer of detainees out of secret detention is not  enough -- the President should rescind any directive that gives  the CIA 'extraordinary powers' to continue to detain people  secretly outside of the law.&quot;
