<p> WASHINGTON - March 27 - Amnesty International  USA Executive Director Dr. William F. Schulz released the  following statement in response to the Pentagon's proposed new  rule barring the use of any evidence obtained by torture in  military commission hearings on the eve of Hamdan v Rumsfeld at  the U.S. Supreme Court: </p>
<p>   &quot;A rule change banning the use of evidence obtained by torture  would be a positive development and brings the Pentagon closer to  compliance with Article 15 of the Convention Against Torture,  signed and ratified by the United States. However, the devil  remains in the details. Without subsequent rules of evidence  barring hearsay testimony or testimony by anonymous witnesses, it  will be very difficult to determine how evidence was obtained. </p>
<p>   &quot;Under no circumstances should any criminal proceeding admit  any evidence gained through torture. The military commissions, as  flawed as they are, should have addressed this basic issue at  their inception. For four years, the commission rules have been  silent regarding this issue, which suggests willingness, if not  desire, to use such evidence in military proceedings. </p>

<p>   &quot;Hamdan v Rumsfeld challenges the fairness and legality of the  military commissions. One of the key impediments to a fair trial  raised by the Hamdan legal team is admissibility of evidence  obtained by torture. For the Pentagon to now say that it is  considering barring the use of any evidence obtained by torture  on the eve of this Supreme Court case appears disingenuous at  best.   </p>
<p>   &quot;The reality that the Pentagon can change rules at any given  moment, even for the better, speaks to the underlying unfairness  of a system that can only be described as a moving target.   Trying to defend the accused in the current system is like  walking in quicksand -- impossible to get a foothold.  There is  nothing that would prohibit the United States government from  retracting any new rule.&quot; </p>
<p>   &quot;The Supreme Court faces an enormous responsibility in the  Hamdan case. At stake are principles of fair trial,  constitutionality and equality before the law -- basic values on  which the entire U.S. legal system is based. Amnesty  International will be watching the Supreme Court case with great  interest, while continuing to call for the end to the military  commissions and the closure of the detention facility at  Guantanamo Bay altogether. The U.S. government should now take  this opportunity to show its commitment to international human  rights standards and abolish trials by military commission at  Guantanamo and revoke the Military Order that created them.&quot; </p>
