<p>Today the Weapons of Mass Destruction Commission chaired by Hans Blix 
presented its report "Weapons of Terror: Freeing the World of Nuclear, 
Biological and Chemical Arms" to UN Secretary General Kofi Annan.

<p>The following nuclear disarmament specialists are available for interviews:

<p>JOHN BURROUGHS, <a href="mailto:johnburroughs@lcnp.org">johnburroughs@lcnp.org</a>, <a href="http://www.lcnp.org" target="_new">http://www.lcnp.org</a>.  Burroughs, executive director of the Lawyers' Committee on Nuclear 
Policy, said today: "The Blix report rightly says that these 
catastrophic devices are dangerous in anyone's hands; that the problems 
of existing arsenals, potential spread, and potential acquisition by 
terrorists are all linked; and that the problems can be solved only by a 
comprehensive approach leading to elimination of all nuclear weapons."

<p>JACQUELINE CABASSO, <a href="mailto:wslf@earthlink.net">wslf@earthlink.net</a>, <a href="http://www.wslfweb.org" target="_new">http://www.wslfweb.org</a>Cabasso is executive director of the Western States Legal 
Foundation, which focuses on nuclear policy issues. She said today: "The 
Commission clearly holds the United States largely responsible for the 
present crisis. By walking away from tried and true arms control 
treaties, and by launching an illegal war in the name of 
'counterproliferation,' the U.S. has seriously undermined international 
law and endangered international security."
<p>Cabasso offered one strong criticism of the report, stating: "The 
Commission explores options for controlling uranium enrichment and 
plutonium separation activities in order to minimize the risks of 
proliferation associated with those activities. But they fail to even 
mention the possibility of phasing out nuclear energy."

<p>JENNIFER NORDSTROM, <a href="mailto:jennifer@reachingcriticalwill.org">jennifer@reachingcriticalwill.org</a>, 
<a href="http://reachingcriticalwill.org" target="_new">http://reachingcriticalwill.org</a>
<p> Nordstrom is project associate for Reaching Critical Will, a program 
of the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom. She 
highlighted the report's statement that a "nuclear disarmament treaty is 
achievable and can be reached through careful, sensible and practical 
measures." Nordstrom cited activity of networks of civil society, such 
as the Abolition 2000 Global Network to Eliminate Nuclear Weapons, as 
well as the existing Chemical Weapons Convention.
