<p>WASHINGTON - June 19 - Sunday's <i>Financial Times</i> story "Iran 'Ready To Limit Nuclear Programme'" reports that "Iran's leadership is ready to limit its nuclear programme but will not suspend uranium enrichment as a precondition for talks, two regime insiders have told the Financial Times." <a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/4a72adca-feef-11da-84f3-0000779e2340.html">Full article</a><br />
<br />
Also on Sunday, the <i>Washington Post</i> reported -- under the headline "In 2003, U.S. Spurned Iran's Offer of Dialogue; Some Officials Lament Lost Opportunity" -- about a "proposal from Iran for a broad dialogue with the United States," which "suggested everything was on the table -- including full cooperation on nuclear programs, acceptance of Israel and the termination of Iranian support for Palestinian militant groups."<br />

<br />
In response to this, the <i>Post</i> reports, the administration "formally complained to the Swiss ambassador who had sent the fax [proposal] with a cover letter certifying it as a genuine proposal supported by key power centers in Iran, former administration officials said." <a href="http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/nation/3979610.html">Full article</a><br />

Mideast specialist Parsi was cited in the <i>Post</i> article as having received a copy of the 2003 Iranian proposal. He said today: "Very few people would have guessed that Iran would have made such offers. This highlights the importance of the two sides getting to the negotiating table without any delay since a negotiated settlement is achievable." Parsi is author of the book <i>Treacherous Triangle: The Secret Dealings of Iran, Israel and the United States</i>.<br />
