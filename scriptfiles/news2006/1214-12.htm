<p>WASHINGTON - December 14 - Beginning  today, as part of the 2006 &quot;Hope for the Holidays&quot;  campaign, WakeUpWalMart.com released a new faith-themed  TV ad campaign, entitled &quot;Search Your Heart.&quot; </p>
<p>   The new TV ad, which is headlined by Pastor Joe  Phelps, a Baptist minister from Louisville, Ky., raises  the moral question of whether or not, especially during  the Christmas season, people of faith can ignore Wal- Mart's exploitation of its workers and their families.  The spot ends by calling on people of Christian faith  to &quot;Search your heart. If these are Wal-Mart's values,  would Jesus shop at Wal-Mart? Should you?&quot;</p>
<p>   The 30-second TV ad will be running in over 25  states and 43 media markets across the country  beginning Thursday, Dec. 14.</p>
<p>   As part of the group's faith-based holiday campaign,  WakeUpWalMart.com also released a joint letter with the  Baptist Center for Ethics, signed by over 131  evangelical leaders that calls on CEO Lee Scott to make  &quot;Wal-Mart a Golden Rule company, one that is mindful in  reflecting the best of Christian values and one that  seeks a higher standard for its employees and their  families.&quot; The letter to Lee Scott is part of  WakeUpWalMart.com's new faith-based initiative called  &quot;America, Pray for Wal-Mart to Change.&quot;</p>
<p>   &quot;When we celebrate Christmas, we mark the birth of  Jesus Christ who gave the moral imperative of the  Golden Rule, a rule that should challenge Christian  consumers to consider where they shop, and that should  challenge Wal-Mart to change its corporate practices  for the better,&quot; said Robert Parham, executive director  of Baptist Center for Ethics.</p>
<p>   As part of the 2006 &quot;America, Pray for Wal-Mart to  Change&quot; initiative, families and children of supporters  of WakeUpWalMart.com, as well as community leaders and  local leaders of faith, will hold local candlelight  vigils and a day of prayer at Wal-Mart stores in over  40 cities and 24 different states, including Florida,  Alabama, Texas, Arkansas, Louisiana, South Carolina,  North Carolina, Virginia, Mississippi and Missouri. </p>
<p>   The &quot;Search Your Heart&quot; TV ad can be viewed in its  entirety at <a href="http://releases.usnewswire.com/redir.asp?ReleaseID=77604&Link=http://WakeUpWalMart.com">http://WakeUpWalMart.com</a>. A copy of the  joint letter, with signatures, is available by  contacting WakeUpWalMart.com.</p>
<p>   -----</p>
<p>   &quot;Search Your Heart&quot; TV Ad Script</p>
<p>   Pastor Joe Phelps: Jesus said, &quot;Do unto others as  you would have them do unto you.&quot;</p>
<p>   But if these are our values can we continue to shop  at Wal-Mart without insulting God?</p>
<p>   Knowing that Wal-Mart has repeatedly broken child  labor laws, is being sued for gender discrimination,  and leaves over half of their employees and families  without company health coverage.</p>
<p>   So as we celebrate Christmas together, search your  heart. If these are Wal-Mart's values, would Jesus shop  at Wal-Mart?</p>
<p>   Should you?</p>
