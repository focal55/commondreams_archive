<p>HINESBURG, Vermont - April 7 - Senators Patrick Leahy and James Jeffords today introduced the Vermont Wilderness Act of 2006 to qualified praise from the environmental community. The bill proposes to create two new wilderness areas and enlarge four existing units in the Green Mountain National Forest, but falls short of the 78,000 acres proposed by the Vermont Wilderness Association.

<p>“The introduction of this bill is a good first step,” said Leanne Klyza Linck, eastern forest senior associate, “and we pledge to work with the delegation and others in Vermont to provide increased protection for key areas as the legislation moves through Congress.”

<p>The legislation proposes to create a 28,500 acre wilderness around Glastenbury Mountain, the largest roadless tract left in Vermont, and a second wilderness area safeguarding 12,500 acres around Romance and Monastery Mountains. Wilderness acreage will also be added to the existing Breadloaf, Lye Brook, Peru Peak, and Big Branch areas. Unfortunately, the current bill carves out a corridor into the heart of the Glastenbury wilderness for snowmobile use, which will threaten the wilderness character and quiet solitude of this special area.

<p>“Vermont’s rural heritage and remote character is increasingly under assault from development and irresponsible ATV use,” continued Klyza Linck. “Wilderness designations are a positive and practical way to safeguard special areas and traditional forest uses on the Green Mountain National Forest.”

<p>“Vermonters love the land,” said Frances A. Hunt, eastern national forests director for the Wilderness Society. “Wilderness designation is the best way to protect the natural beauty and peace and quiet of the Green Mountains.”

<p>Currently, the Green Mountain National Forest has six protected wilderness areas, totaling 58,844 acres, or about 1 percent of the state. Existing wilderness areas such as Breadloaf and Lye Brook are popular hiking destinations for families and for scores of Vermonters who enjoy songbirds, skiing or just getting away from it all. Last year, more than 10,000 people submitted comments on the draft plan for the Green Mountain National Forest, and over 90 percent voiced their support for more wilderness.

<p>“The Senators heard the wishes of Vermonters and took action,” added Klyza Linck. “But then, nine out of ten Vermonters supporting more wilderness sends a pretty strong message.”

<p>The Wilderness System was created by Congress in 1964 and has 106 million acres of public lands. Wilderness designation allows for most activities, except the use of mechanical vehicles and development.

<p>Founded in 1935, The Wilderness Society is a nonprofit organization dedicated to the protection of the nation’s wilderness and has more than 300,000 members and supporters.
