<p>WASHINGTON - January 24 - Americans United for Separation of Church and State today deplored the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee&#8217;s approval of Samuel Alito Jr.&#8217;s nomination to the Supreme Court.
<P>&#8220;The Bush administration&#8217;s goal of pushing the nation&#8217;s top court to the far right took a step forward with today&#8217;s Senate action,&#8221; said the Rev. Barry W. Lynn, executive director of Americans United. &#8220;The Senate committee members who supported the nomination are clearly on board with the president&#8217;s goal of creating a court that will roll back civil liberties.</P>
<P>&#8220;Alito&#8217;s record reveals that he is bent on lowering the wall separating government and religion,&#8221; Lynn continued. &#8220;It is no wonder that Religious Right activists are working so hard in support of the nomination.&#8221;</P>
<P>The Judiciary Committee voted 10-8 to move Alito&#8217;s nomination to the Senate floor, and a vote there may occur by week&#8217;s end. Americans United is working diligently with members of the Senate to educate them about Alito&#8217;s alarming religious liberty record and to urge them to vote against confirmation.</P>
<P><A href="DocServer/AU_Alito_Report.pdf?docID=401">Americans United issued a report in December</A> detailing Alito&#8217;s staunchly anti-separationist legal record and sent a letter to the committee Jan. 10 urging it to reject the nomination. </P>
<P>Lynn said Americans United urges the Senate to derail the nomination and ask the president to name a judge more in line with Sandra Day O&#8217;Connor, the moderate justice whom Alito is nominated to replace.</P>
<P>&#8220;O&#8217;Connor was not an ideologue,&#8221; Lynn added. &#8220;She often provided an important vote for preserving the church-state wall and protecting the rights of religious minorities. Alito&#8217;s record suggests strongly that he would not be inclined to follow O&#8217;Connor&#8217;s lead, but would instead help tilt the court sharply to the right.&#8221;</P>
