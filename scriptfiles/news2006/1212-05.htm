<p>WASHINGTON - December 12 - As Chile 
                  prepared to bury General Augusto Pinochet, the National Security 
                  Archive today posted a selection of declassified U.S. documents 
                  that illuminate the former dictator's record of repression. 
                  The documents include CIA records on Pinochet's role in the 
                  Washington D.C. car bombing that killed former Chilean ambassador 
                  Orlando Letelier and his American colleague Ronni Moffitt, Defense 
                  Intelligence Agency biographic reports on Pinochet, and transcripts 
                  of meetings in which Secretary of State Henry Kissinger resisted 
                  bringing pressure on the Chilean military for its human rights 
atrocities.</p>
                <p>&quot;Pinochet's death has denied his victims a final judicial 
                  reckoning,&quot; said Peter Kornbluh, who directs the Archive's 
                  Chile Documentation Project. &quot;But the declassified documents 
                  do contribute to the ultimate verdict of history on his atrocities.&quot;</p>
                <p>Most of the documents posted today are drawn from a collection 
                  of 24,000 declassified records that were released by the Clinton 
                  administration after Pinochet's October, 1998, arrest in London. 
                  Many of them are reproduced in Kornbluh's book, <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1565845862/qid=1075765067/sr=2-1/ref=sr_2_1/104-0164663-4213532" target="_blank"><strong>The 
                  Pinochet File: A Declassified Dossier on Atrocity and Accountability</strong></a></em>.</p>
                <p>Pinochet died of complications from a heart attack on December 
                  10, which was, by coincidence, International Human Rights Day.</p>
