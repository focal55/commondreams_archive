<P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON - February 28 - As the Senate Judiciary Committee held its second oversight 
hearing on the Bush administration&#8217;s warrantless surveillance of Americans by 
the National Security Agency, the American Civil Liberties Union welcomed the 
move as a necessary step to help restore the rule of law. That panel heard from 
legal experts about the unconstitutionality of the illegal program of spying on 
Americans.</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"It is clear that this illegal program violates our Constitution and laws 
governing surveillance," said Caroline Fredrickson, Director of the ACLU 
Washington Legislative Office. "The president&#8217;s false choice between securing 
our nation and preserving our Constitution must be rejected. Congress has an 
obligation to determine the truth, especially since the administration is 
unwilling to check itself. Hearings like this help ensure steps are taken so the 
rule of law is respected by all, even the president."</font></P><P align=left>
</P><P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Today&#8217;s hearing featured legal experts from across the political spectrum, 
many of whom have serious concerns about the warrantless eavesdropping program&#8217;s 
legality. It comes on the heels of the White House&#8217;s refusal on Monday to 
appoint a special counsel to investigate the illegal NSA program. The ACLU had 
asked Attorney General Alberto Gonzales to appoint a special counsel last 
December, and several House Democrats echoed that call.</font></P><P align=left>
</P><P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A poll of more than 1000 registered voters that was commissioned by the ACLU 
was released last Friday. The results showed that a majority polled opposes the 
warrantless eavesdropping program and there is a strong belief among voters for 
the need for the executive branch to be subject to the checks and balances of 
the courts and Congress. The ACLU noted that when given the facts about the 
illegal surveillance program - that it is conducted without warrants - a 
majority of American voters reject the president&#8217;s claim that it is necessary 
and legal.</font></P><P align=left>
</P><P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Since news of the program broke last year, the ACLU, civil rights and privacy 
groups, legal scholars, members of Congress and the non-partisan Congressional 
Research Service have all raised questions about the legality of the program. 
The ACLU has also filed a legal challenge to the unconstitutional program and a 
Freedom of Information Act request to obtain more details about the operation. 
On Presidents&#8217; Day, the ACLU hosted a national town hall forum on the 
warrantless spying program.</font></P><P align=left>
</P><P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"The unwillingness of the administration to be honest about this secret 
program to spy on Americans demands that Congress get the facts, not just 
administration rhetoric," said Lisa Graves, ACLU Senior Counsel for Legislative 
Strategy. "The truth can be determined without compromising national security. 
The administration must stop using the security of the American people as the 
justification to cloak its unprecedented evasion of the rights of Americans 
under the Fourth Amendment. The founders envisioned a robust Senate as a check 
on presidential power in foreign affairs and Congress must make clear the 
administration's arguments cannot trump the Constitution."</font></P>
