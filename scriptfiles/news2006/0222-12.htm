<p>NEW YORK  - February 22 - Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans
  Frontières (MSF) has started an emergency intervention in southern Sudan in
  response to a severe cholera outbreak in Juba town. The first suspected cases
  in the region were reported at the end of January in the town of Yei, southwest
  of Juba. Since then the disease has spread quickly. On February 6, the first
  suspected case was identified in Juba. The cholera outbreak was confirmed a
  few days later. After 15 days, by February 21st, 1,864 cases and 45 deaths
  recorded.
<p>After mounting an emergency response in Yei, MSF's new emergency intervention
  will focus on Juba, a town of more than 250,000 inhabitants and designated
  as the capital city of southern Sudan after the 2005 North-South peace agreement.
  The objective of the intervention is to reduce mortality of infected cases
  and to stop the spread of the disease. An MSF team is already working in a
  Cholera Treatment Center (CTC) set up in Al Shaaba pediatric hospital. MSF
  will ensure adequate treatment in the CTC, train local health staff, establish
  clear treatment protocols, and ensure regular supplies. </p>
<p>MSF is planning to increase the capacity of the CTC, and, if necessary, set
  up new structures in order to face the important number of new cases. For the
  time being, another CTC is in Juba teaching hospital, but it has already reached
  full capacity. </p>
<p>Apart from the case management, the MSF team is working toward a comprehensive
  strategy to respond to the outbreak. It is coordinating with other actors to
  ensure an effective referral system, accurate surveillance of the evolution
  of the outbreak, provision of safe drinking water, safe burials, and disinfection
  of patient homes. Since cholera is not endemic to the region, it is expected
  that the population will have limited knowledge about the transmission and
  prevention of the disease. Therefore, emphasis will also be put on educational
  activities. </p>
<p>The epidemic is affecting a non-endemic urban area where the population relies
  heavily on polluted water from the river Nile. For all these reasons, a large
  outbreak can be expected. MSF currently has 11 international staff working
  on the ground, to be reinforced with seven more people before this weekend.
  More than 70 tons of medical and logistics material will be sent to Juba in
the coming days.</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
