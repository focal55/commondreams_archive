<p>NAIROBI	 - November 6 - Greenpeace today issued an urgent call to Governments attending the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Nairobi to face reality and act urgently to avoid dangerous climate change.

<p>“The worst impacts of climate change CAN be prevented, but only if Governments act now,” said Steve Sawyer, Climate & Energy Policy Advisor for Greenpeace International. “Future generations will not forgive us if we delay”.

<p>This conference, the first to be held in sub-Saharan Africa, is expected to focus sharply on adaptation, and the need for urgent support to the world’s poorest, who are already being impacted by climate change. Nowhere is this clearer than in Africa, and Greenpeace’s youth delegation, the Solar Generation will be highlighting climate change impacts in Africa throughout the conference.

<p>“The legal, moral, and political obligations of the rich countries are clear: they must dramatically reduce their emissions and at the same time be prepared to provide massive support to help the poorest countries adapt to the climate change that we are already committed to,” said Sawyer.

<p>With developing countries across the world already being hit first and worst by the impacts of climate change, today Greenpeace will present its report and documentary, “Changes of Climate, Changes of Lives”, presenting testimonies from victims of climate change across Brazil. The report and documentary also explore the relationship between the destruction of the largest rainforest in the world – the Amazon – and climate change; and how forest destruction makes Brazil the fourth largest CO2 emitter in the world.

<p>“Brazil needs to take responsibility as one of the world’s biggest CO2 emitters. The Government must combat deforestation; promote clean, renewable energy; and energy efficiency. The Brazilian people have the right to know how vulnerable we are to climate change and what our Government will do to reduce our contribution to this problem,” says Carlos Rittl, Greenpeace Brazil Climate & Energy Campaigner.

<p>“The 163 governments that have signed up to the Kyoto Protocol need to put aside their short-term interests in favor of fighting this global menace. That is in everyone’s interest in the long run”, said Sawyer.
