<P>NEW YORK - February 28 - Amnesty International USA's  New 
York City Women's Human Rights Action Team, Amnesty International USA, and 
Mexico Solidarity Network are co-sponsoring an event this Friday evening, March 3rd, at Judson Memorial Church, to inform the public about the ongoing disappearances and murders of women in Juarez and Chihuahua, Mexico.

<P>The brutal murders of over 400 women and girls in Juarez have been documented, and women in the border city continue to disappear and 
suffer
violent deaths at over twice the rate of the rest of the country.  
Activists
for women's human rights are demanding that the Mexican authorities 
properly
investigate these crimes, end the impunity enjoyed by murderers, bring 
the
perpetrators to justice, and end the siege of violence in the region.

<P>Panelists and a film will explore the interlinked causes of the disappearances and murders of women and girls in Mexico's most violent 
city.
These include the vulnerability of low-income migrant women workers in a globalized economy, drug trafficking and prostitution rings run by 
organized
crime, and corrupt authorities.

<P><b>Speakers:
</b>
<P><b>Veronica Leyva</b>, a former maquiladora worker and long-time women's 
rights and
labor activist from Ciudad Juarez.

<P><b>Debbie Nathan</b>, New York-based writer who has covered immigration and U.S.-Mexico border issues for 25 years. She is a contributing writer 
for The
Nation, New York Magazine, and The New York Times.

<P><b>Short Film:</b>   "Dual Injustice: Femicide and Torture in Ciudad Juarez and
Chihuahua," a new video that chronicles how the families of a murdered 
girl
and her cousin, who was tortured to falsely confess to her murder, 
joined
forces in a remarkable common struggle for justice. Co produced by 
WITNESS
and Comision Mexicana por la Defensa y Promocion de los Derechos Humanos

<P><b>When: </b>Friday, March 3, 2006, from 7:00 pm - 8:30 pm.
Admission is free.

<P><b>Where:</b> Judson Memorial Church Assembly Hall, 239 Thompson St. between Washington Square South and Bleeker Street. (<b>Trains: </b>A/C/E/F/D/B to West 4th, N/R to 8th Street, 6 to Astor Place)
