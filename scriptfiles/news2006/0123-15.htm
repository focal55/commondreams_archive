<p>WASHINGTON - January 23 - Americans United for Separation of Church and State today urged the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee to derail the nomination of Judge Samuel Alito Jr. to the nation&#8217;s highest court.
<P>&#8220;Judge Alito has a troubling record as a federal judge,&#8221; said the Rev. Barry W. Lynn, executive director of Americans United. &#8220;Time and again he has participated in decisions that showed insensitivity to religious minorities.</P>
<P>&#8220;The Judiciary Committee should scuttle the Alito nomination and ask the Bush administration to send it a nominee in the mold of Justice Sandra Day O&#8217;Connor,&#8221; continued Lynn. &#8220;The committee should not bend to the administration&#8217;s desire to appease its narrow right-wing base.&#8221;</P>
<P>The Judiciary Committee is expected to vote tomorrow on Alito&#8217;s nomination. </P>
<P>Americans United noted that Alito&#8217;s record indicates that he is likely to side with the court&#8217;s most extreme right-wing justices, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, in overturning decades of Supreme Court precedent. </P>
<P><A href="DocServer/AU_Alito_Report.pdf?docID=401">In a December report</A>, Americans United detailed Alito&#8217;s tenure on the appeals court, which showed him to be callous towards the rights of religious minorities and eager to support government promotion of the majority&#8217;s religion. </P>
<P>In a letter sent earlier this month to the leaders of the Judiciary Committee, Lynn argued that Alito&#8217;s understanding of the First Amendment principle of church-state separation &#8220;differs dramatically&#8221; from O&#8217;Connor&#8217;s and from long-settled precedent upholding religious liberty. </P>
<P>Alito&#8217;s focus on the 3rd Circuit, Lynn&#8217;s Jan. 10 letter stated, centered primarily on helping religious majorities use government forums to promote their beliefs. </P>
<P>&#8220;Judge Alito has given broad license to religious majorities to use the public schools and other official settings to broadcast their religious messages without regard for the competing rights and interests of religious minorities,&#8221; Lynn argued.</P>
