<p>NEW YORK - December 12 - Today attorneys with the Center for Constitutional Rights (CCR) filed an appeal in the Second Circuit on behalf of Maher Arar, an innocent victim of the Bush administration’s practice of “extraordinary rendition.” A Syrian-born Canadian citizen, Mr. Arar was detained by the U.S. in September 2002 and then rendered to Syria, where he was tortured and detained for nearly a year before being released without charge. He was the first victim of the practice to come forward and contest his treatment in a U.S. court; in February 2006 the District Court dismissed his case on national security and foreign policy grounds.  In rejecting Mr. Arar’s claims, the court stated that “one need not have much imagination to contemplate the negative effect on our relations with Canada…were it to turn out that certain high Canadian officials had, despite public denials, acquiesced in Arar's removal to Syria.”  This past September, an official Canadian commission confirmed that the torture of Mr. Arar had nothing to do with any legitimate struggle against terrorism. It officially declared him innocent and found no evidence that Canadian officials acquiesced in Mr. Arar’s detention in the U.S. or his removal to Syria.

 

<p>“Canada has investigated and shed light on what was done to Maher,” said CCR attorney Maria LaHood, “but the U.S. still owes him his day in court.  We cannot continue to deny him justice for the abuses he suffered at the hands of the Bush Administration.”

 

<p>Today, the Canadian Commission of Inquiry is scheduled to release its second report, which is expected to suggest new oversight for the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) in its terrorism-related activities.  In a huge shakeup last week as a result of the first report by the Commission, RCMP Commissioner Giuliano Zaccardelli tendered his resignation.  In addition, Mr. Arar is set to be in mediation with the Canadian government later this week to negotiate a settlement for their role in his detention and torture, and for their role in harming his reputation.

 

<p>Maher Arar said, “For three difficult years, I have searched for justice. I will not give up until the people responsible for what was done to me are held accountable so that they can never do this to anyone else ever again.” 

 

<p>Mr. Arar was detained at J.F.K. Airport in September 2002 on his way home to Canada. He was held in solitary confinement and interrogated without the benefit of legal counsel. The Administration labeled him a member of Al Qaeda and sent him not to Canada, his home and country of citizenship, but to Syrian intelligence authorities renowned for torture.  Mr. Arar had protested his innocence and begged U.S. officials not to send him to Syria where, he told them, he would be tortured, yet he spent nearly a year detained in Syria, where he was brutally interrogated and tortured, but never charged. Upon Mr. Arar’s release, Syrian authorities stated that they had found no connection to any criminal or terrorist organization or activity.  The Canadian Commission found that “Canadian investigators made extensive efforts to find any information that could implicate Mr. Arar in terrorist activities,” and “they found none.”

 

<p>According to the report of the Canadian Commission, "Tellingly, the Americans have never provided the Canadian authorities with any information of their own about Mr. Arar that would have supported the removal order to send him to Syria. Given close cooperation between the RCMP and the American agencies, it seems likely that, if they had such information, they would have supplied it to the Canadians."

 

<p>In dismissing Mr. Arar’s case, the District Court held that in cases that involved the Bush administration’s "war on terror," U.S. courts should not intervene, even to redress cases of torture procured by American government officials.  Ms. LaHood said, “In claiming the court could not hear cases like Mr. Arar’s, the District Court abdicated its responsibility to ensure that our constitutional rights are enforced and protected, and to review the broad powers exercised by the Executive.”  In the District Court, the government also invoked the “state secrets privilege” claiming that litigation would risk disclosing the reason they sent Mr. Arar to Syria instead of Canada and thereby harm national security and foreign relations.  

 

<p>CCR Executive Director Vincent Warren said, “Again and again, the Bush administration has committed grievous abuses and then claimed those same abuses are ‘state secrets’ that cannot be revealed in open court.  The facts of Maher’s case are well known. The government merely seeks to hide its illegal and immoral behavior from the public and avoid accountability for its actions.  They ruined a man’s life: let him see justice.”
