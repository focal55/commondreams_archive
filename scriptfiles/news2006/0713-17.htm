<p>WASHINGTON - July 13 - 

<p><a href="mailto:pcarroll@ploughshares.org">PAUL CARROLL</a>, <a href="http://www.ploughshares.org" target="_new">http://www.ploughshares.org</a><br>

    Carroll is a program officer at the Plowshares Fund, which works on 
disarmament issues. He has just returned from North Korea, where he had 
rare, detailed conversations with North Korean officials, including Vice 
Foreign Minister for U.S. Relations Kim Gae Gwan and his deputy, Li Gun, 
their former UN ambassador. Said Carrol: "We arrived in North Korea on 
the afternoon of July 4 [and] woke up the next morning to the news of 
the missile launches. ... In our discussions, for every concern or 
issued [we] raised, the North Koreans had a seemingly sound, 
counter-argument..."

    AbuKhalil is author of several books on the Mideast including 
"Historical Dictionary of Lebanon." He has just returned from several 
weeks in Lebanon. Abukhalil is a professor in the department of politics 
at California State University, Stanislaus, and a visiting professor at 
the University of California, Berkeley.
    AbuKhalil and his blog were recently <a href="http://harpers.org/sb-a-statue-to-reason-1152745267.html" target="_new">profiled</a> in Harper's. He <a href="http://angryarab.blogspot.com" target="_new">wrote</a>this morning: "Israel has already killed 
some 50 Lebanese all but one are civilians. Israeli record of violence 
against Arab civilians is quite comparable to that of Al-Qa'idah. I mean 
that. Both are equally reckless in their killing of civilians, and both 
use the same justifications for their murders."

<p><a href="mailto:patrickseale@compuserve.com">PATRICK SEALE</a><br>

    Seale is a British journalist now living in France and a leading 
expert on the Mideast. His books include "Asad: The Struggle for the 
Middle East." Seale said today: "The Israeli attack is bound to be a 
major factor at the G8 meeting. If it's just allowed to go on, this 
might trigger another regional war. One striking aspect has been the 
U.S.'s seeming passivity. One might have expected the U.S. to speak out 
against Israel's bombing civilian infrastructure and to send an envoy to 
defuse the situation.
<p>"You have the rise of essentially non-state actors like Hezbollah 
and Hamas because of the vacuum created by the impotence of Arab states 
to contain or deter Israel. These actors are basically taking issue with 
Israel's 'deterrence,' which posits that Israel can strike but no one 
can strike at it."
