<p>BRIDGEPORT, Connecticut - June 1 - The American Civil Liberties Union today 
welcomed a ruling by a federal court expanding protections to needle exchange 
program participants. The court expanded the scope of a previous order, which 
prohibited the Bridgeport Police Department from harassing or arresting 
individuals who possess needles, ruling that other forms of injection equipment 
are protected as well. <P></P>
<P>&#8220;The message of this much-needed ruling should be heard 
nationwide,&#8221; said Adam Wolf, an attorney with the ACLU Drug Law Reform 
Project.&nbsp; &#8220;Public health should be 
placed above punitive posturing.&nbsp; 
Law enforcement should be chiefly concerned with the public welfare, 
which is markedly increased by respecting the rights of needle exchange 
participants and acknowledging the vital importance of these exchanges to public 
safety.&#8221;</P>
<P>Today&#8217;s ruling expands the scope of a previous court order 
issued in 2001 in the case <I>Doe v. Bridgeport Police Department</I>.&nbsp; Based on the U.S. Constitution&#8217;s Fourth 
Amendment protection from unreasonable search and seizure, the 2001 order 
blocked the Bridgeport Police Department (BPD) &#8220;from searching, stopping, 
arresting, punishing or penalizing&#8230;any person based solely upon that person&#8217;s 
possession of up to thirty sets of injection equipment.&#8221;</P>
<P>But as U.S. District Judge Janet C. Hall, who presided over 
both the initial case and the recent hearing, said during a recent courtroom 
session, &#8220;My order may well have been written in invisible ink.&#8221;</P>
<P>While Judge Hall expanded protection to include general 
injection equipment, such as cotton balls and items used to heat drugs, and 
chastised the BPD for failure to diligently adhere to the initial order, the 
court denied the ACLU&#8217;s motion to hold the BPD in contempt of court.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Testimony introduced in the case documented repeated 
instances of police threatening, arresting and assaulting individuals based 
solely on possession of injection equipment or participation in a local needle 
exchange program.&nbsp; Furthermore, 
police routinely confiscated syringes and needle exchange participants&#8217; 
identification cards &#8211; thereby disallowing effective participation in the 
exchange program and directly endangering the public&#8217;s safety.</P>
<P>The Bridgeport Syringe Exchange has been in operation for 
over a dozen years.&nbsp; The program, 
whose members are issued identification cards, dispenses clean needles in return 
for used ones and also makes available materials, such as citric acid, that 
decrease the dangers of infection associated with intravenous drug use.&nbsp; Just as importantly, the exchange serves 
as a bridge to treatment for its many participants by connecting them to other 
public health services and encouraging them to enter drug treatment 
programs.</P>
<P>&#8220;The police can contribute to public health and safety by 
supporting efforts that engage injection drug users in disease prevention 
programs that simultaneously serve as conduits to treatment for addiction,&#8221; said 
Robert Heimer, Ph.D., a professor at Yale School of Public Health and a 
nationally renowned expert on the emergence and prevention of infectious 
diseases.&nbsp; &#8220;In the long run, this is 
the only reliable means to decrease addiction at the community level.&#8221;</P>
<P>Every scientific study of needle exchange programs has 
concluded that access to sterile injection equipment is a proven way to reduce the spread of 
deadly, infectious blood-borne diseases.&nbsp; 
Organizations supporting increased sterile syringe access include the 
National Academy of Sciences, the American Medical Association, the National 
Institute of Health (NIH), and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
(CDC).</P>
<P>Needle exchange programs have been found to reduce HIV 
transmission by more than 30 percent, according to the NIH, and to increase the 
likelihood of injection drug users to enter treatment programs by five times, 
according to a study published in the <I>Journal of Substance Abuse 
Treatment</I>.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Additionally, the CDC reported that through 2003, 26 percent 
of AIDS cases in the United States among people age 13 or older arose from 
exposure to injection drug use.&nbsp; 
Among women, a staggering 61 percent of AIDS cases stemmed from injection 
drug use. </P>
<P>The ruling was issued by the U.S. District Court for the 
District of Connecticut.&nbsp; The BPD 
and its Acting Chief, Anthony Armeno, were defendants in the case.</P>
