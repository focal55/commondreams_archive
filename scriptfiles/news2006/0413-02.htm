<p>AMSTERDAM - April 13 - Dutch banking giant ING 
announced in a letter to Friends of the Earth International, CEDHA and 
BankTrack that it is pulling out of a divisive venture opposed by 
environmentalists and local communities in Uruguay and Argentina.

<p>The ING Group wrote in an April 12 letter that its participation in the 
1.7 billion USD controversial paper mill project of Finnish company 
Botnia in Uruguay "is no longer under consideration".

<p>The ING Group had an advisory role to the company and was to arrange a 
USD 480 million loan package from private banks for the project. The 
paper mill has been strongly criticized in Uruguay and Argentina for its 
severe negative environmental impacts.

<p>Botnia has already started to build a paper mill on the Uruguay river, 
at the border with Argentina. The project will have strong environmental 
impacts as it will pollute air and water and contribute to the increase 
in damaging monoculture plantations.

<p>The project has led to hot protests in both countries. Activists built 
roadblocks on bridges across the river linking the two countries. The 
project also brought relations between the governments of Argentina and 
Uruguay to a breaking point, with both governments indicating that they 
want to bring the case to the International Court of Justice in the 
Hague for violation of an international treaty governing the Uruguay river.

<p>Friends of the Earth International, Center for Human Rights and 
Environment (CEDHA, from Argentina) and BankTrack told ING that they 
were going to inform the ING shareholders meeting on April 25, 2006 
about the negative impacts of the project.

<p>Just two weeks before the ING shareholders meeting, ING informed the 
three organizations in an April 12 letter that "ING's advisory and 
coordinating role has been concluded . and further participation in the 
process - whereby funds would be made available to the project - is no 
longer under consideration".

<p>According to Daniel Taillant from CEDHA "This decision is another 
serious blow for Botnia. Recently the International Finance Corporation, 
the private arm of the World Bank, announced that it would postpone 
consideration of loans to the paper mill project until new identified 
shortcomings of the environmental and social impact studies could be 
addressed".

<p>"We are pleased to see that ING has decided not to finance this 
controversial project. The paper mill constitutes a clear violation of 
the Equator Principles for private investments which ING signed on to," 
according to Paul de Clerck of Friends of the Earth International.

<p>"The paper mill is exactly the sort of project that should not pass the 
Equator Principles test. At a time when major banks debate a revision of 
the Equator Principles it is a very welcome signal that ING took these 
guidelines for project finance seriously" said Johan Frijns, coordinator 
of BankTrack.
