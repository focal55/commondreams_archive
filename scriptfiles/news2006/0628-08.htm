<p>WASHINGTON - June 28 - More than 25,000 public  documents detailing the privately funded travel taken by members  of Congress and their aides from January 2000 to June 2005, was  made public today by the Center for Public Integrity.</p>
<p>   The database, which can be accessed at  <a href="http://releases.usnewswire.com/redir.asp?ReleaseID=68438&Link=http://www.publicintegrity.org">http://www.publicintegrity.org</a> , is the product of nearly a  year's worth of investigative research done by Center staff,  American Public Media reporters and Northwestern University  Medill School students.</p>
<p>   Users will be able to look up specific travelers,  destinations, costs, and sponsors of nearly 23,000 privately  sponsored trips taken by lawmakers and their staff. The  information will also be linked to the travel documents  themselves, giving journalists and the public a chance to conduct  their own reporting and analysis.</p>
<p>   The "Power Trips" database is a major breakthrough in  reporting on congressional travel. Forms related to such travel  are often kept out of public view, filed in a difficult-to-read  manner, or left incomplete. As investigators discovered during  the course of their research:</p>
<p>   -- The House of Representatives' forms are kept in a sub- basement of the Cannon House Office Building, where the public  copies are often hard to read, torn and misfiled. It is against  House rules to digitally scan the documents.</p>
<p>   -- The Senate travel disclosure documents are stored in a  computer system in the Hart Senate Office Building, but the  records are not available online.</p>
<p>   "Power Trips: Congressional Staffers Share the Road" revealed  that members of Congress and their staffs took nearly $50 million  worth of privately sponsored trips to places around the world.  Often this travel was sponsored by groups with legislative  interests before Congress.</p>
<p>   The study's main findings were released on June 5</p>
