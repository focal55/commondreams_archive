<p>WASHINGTON - August 9 - Campaign for America's Future co-director Robert Borosage said tonight's Connecticut Democratic Primary Election results sent a clear message to leaders of both political parties. Sen. Joe Lieberman, D-Conn., who was defeated in a tough battle to keep his Senate seat said on Monday that the voters who were upset with him were trying to "send me a message," and he assured them, "I got their message."</p>

<p align="center"><b>STATEMENT OF ROBERT L. BOROSAGE</b></p>

<p style="font-size: 12px">The voters of Connecticut sent a very clear message by upsetting an 18-year incumbent. They nominated an exceptional leader who has shown grit, but candidates of every stripe should listen to what the voters are saying.</p>

<p style="font-size: 12px">There is enormous anger about the failed policies of the right and in opposition to the Iraq War. Voters are enraged at politicians of either party who have supported or enabled the president.</p>

<p style="font-size: 12px">Lamont's victory was fueled by new grassroots energy in the Democratic Party that is tired of losing elections, and sick of Democrats who duck and cover, rather than challenging the Right. This movement reflects the growing majority of Americans who are looking for a dramatically different direction in our politics &#8211; seeking bold changes in foreign and domestic policies that increasingly don't work for them.</p>

<p style="font-size: 12px">Politicians of both parties who haven't gotten the message better get it quickly. It's time for Democrats and progressives of all stripes to rally together.</p>
