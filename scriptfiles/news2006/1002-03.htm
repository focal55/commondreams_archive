<p>WASHINGTON - October 2 - Citizens for  Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) wrote to the  Department of Justice Inspector General's office today to ask for  an investigation into why the Federal Bureau of Investigation  (FBI) failed to begin investigating Rep. Mark Foley's e-mails to a  former House page as soon as the bureau learned about the e-mails  in July.</p>
<p>   On July 21, CREW received a set of e-mails, allegedly from Foley  to a former House page, which it sent to the FBI later that day. The  emails, posted at <a href="http://releases.usnewswire.com/redir.asp?ReleaseID=73577&Link=http://www.citizensforethics.org">http://www.citizensforethics.org</a> , asked the page,  who had recently left the Hill, his age, how school was going and  what he wanted for his birthday. Rep. Foley also requested the boy's  photograph.</p>
<p>   &quot;As a former prosecutor who handled sex crimes in the District  of Columbia, the emails set off alarm bells. Grown men simply do  not send emails requesting photographs to teenagers over whom  they have had some degree of authority,&quot; Melanie Sloan, executive  director of CREW, wrote today.</p>
<p>   It appears only now, at the instigation of the House of  Representatives leadership's request, that the FBI has begun a  preliminary investigation into former Foley's conduct. Speaker of  the House Dennis Hastert sent a letter to Attorney General Alberto  Gonzales requesting an investigation into Foley's actions as well as  who knew about Foley's conduct, when they knew it and why they did  not forward that information to law enforcement authorities.</p>
<p>   Sloan stated today, &quot;Since the FBI has known about Rep.  Foley's emails since July, the question arises: Did the  administration help to cover up Rep. Foley's conduct and leave a  potential sexual predator on the loose? Was the administration  more concerned with protecting a powerful ally in Congress than  with protecting children?&quot; </p>
<p>   Sloan continued, &quot;The American public deserves to know not  just how and why members of Congress failed to take action to  protect the youngsters entrusted to the care of the House of  Representatives, but also why the FBI -- an agency charged with  protecting the public -- failed to safeguard other youngsters  from a potential sexual predator.&quot;</p>
<p>   CREW's letters and Foley's e-mails are available at  <a href="http://releases.usnewswire.com/redir.asp?ReleaseID=73577&Link=http://www.citizensforethics.org">http://www.citizensforethics.org</a>. </p>
