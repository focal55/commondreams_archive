<p>WASHINGTON - June 26 - Citizens for  Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) today supplemented  its existing Internal Revenue Services (IRS) complaint against  Americans for Tax Reform (ATR), and Americans for Tax Reform  Foundation (ATR Foundation), conservative, non-profit  organizations led by right-wing activist Grover Norquist. The  supplemental information was derived from the June 22 Senate  Committee on Indian Affairs report, "Gimme Five" -- Investigation  of Tribal Lobbying Matters. The original complaint had asked the  IRS to investigate activities by Norquist's groups which may  violate IRS regulations and require a revocation of their tax- exempt status.</p>
<p>   The complaint, sent March 14, alleged that Norquist used  either or both ATR and ATR Foundation as commercial enterprises  by laundering money derived from Indian casino clients of former  lobbyist and convicted felon Jack Abramoff. The casinos made  contributions to ATR, which then skimmed a fee off the top before  passing the money on to former Christian activist Ralph Reed and  other anti-gambling activists. In this way, Norquist, Reed and  Abramoff were able to disguise the fact that the money used to  fund anti-gambling activities was generated through Indian  gambling. The point of the anti-gambling campaigns was to prevent  competition to the Indian casinos.</p>
<p>   Reed originally denied knowing the funds came from Indian  casinos, but during hearings held by the Senate Indian Affairs  Committee, Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) released numerous e-mails  clearly demonstrating that Reed did, in fact, know where the  money came from. The e-mails show that Reed and Norquist worked  with Abramoff to create the anti-gambling campaigns and to  develop the scheme to hide the origins of the money.</p>
<p>   The complaint also alleged that the money ATR received from  the Indian casinos constitutes taxable business income because  ATR was providing services unrelated to its tax-exempt purpose:  to increase public awareness about the size and regulations of  government and rally support for lower taxes and smaller  government. Charging a fee for serving as a pass-through for  money used to finance anti-gambling campaigns bears no relation  to ATR's stated tax-exempt purpose. </p>
<p>   Finally, the complaint alleged that ATR violated IRS public  disclosure requirements by refusing to provide a copy of its  application for tax-exempt status when requested to do so.</p>
<p>   In CREW's supplemental letter to its complaint, the Committee  confirmed that as early as May 20, 1999, Norquist expressed to  Abramoff his interest in gaining access to money from the  Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians tribe to fill a "$75K hole in  (ATR's) budget." This was followed up by a $325,000 payment to  ATR from the Choctaw in late 1999. ATR, in turn, sent $300,000 of  this payment to Citizens Against Legalized Lottery, and kept  $25,000 for its services.</p>
<p>   "This new evidence from the Senate Indian Affairs report  confirms and expands upon CREW's original complaint which alleged  that Mr. Norquist was violating his organizations' tax-exempt  status by operating as a commercial enterprise," Melanie Sloan,  executive director of CREW, said today. "By allowing ATR to be  used as a pass-through for funds generated by Indian casinos, Mr.  Norquist was able to assist his friend Ralph Reed in Mr. Reed's  anti-gambling efforts, while making a tidy profit for his tax- exempt organization. Mr. Norquist should be held accountable for  his illegal activities. The IRS should immediately launch an  investigation."</p>
