<p>WASHINGTON - January 24 - Citizens for  Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) has prepared an  ethics complaint against Acting House Majority Leader Roy Blunt  (R-Mo.). CREW is releasing the complaint in the hopes of finding  a Member of the House of Representatives willing to forward the  complaint to the House Committee on Standards of Official Conduct  for consideration. </p>
<p>   CREW is not filing the complaint directly with the Committee  because only Members of the House can do so. Any Member of the  House can, however, certify that CREW's complaint has a good  faith basis and forward the complaint to the Ethics Committee,  stating that the complaint merits the Committee's consideration. </p>
<p>   CREW's ethics complaint against Rep. Blunt alleges that he  violated numerous House ethics rules by providing legislative  assistance that benefitted his family members and resulted in  hundreds of thousands of dollars in contributions to his  political committees. </p>
<p>   "If rooting out corruption in the House of Representatives is  truly a priority for both parties, then we ask a member, any  member, to put their money where their mouth is and file this  complaint against Acting House Majority Leader Roy Blunt,"  Melanie Sloan, executive director of CREW said today. "We urge  members to end the ethics 'truce' and cease abdicating their  responsibility to police the conduct of their colleagues." </p>
<p>   Allegations in the complaint include:</p>
<p>   In November 2002, hours after he was named new Majority Whip,  Rep. Blunt attempted to secretly insert a provision into pending  legislation that would have benefitted Philip Morris at the  expense of its competitors. Philip Morris, a division of the  conglomerate Altria Group Inc., is Rep. Blunt's largest campaign  contributor. Within days of the announcement of Rep. Blunt's new  position, Altria donated a hefty $32,400 to Rep. Blunt's  political action committee (PAC). In addition, Rep. Blunt was  dating Philip Morris's lobbyist, Abigail Perlman, whom he has  since married.</p>
<p>   In 2003, Rep. Blunt introduced a legislative provision that  would have benefitted United Parcel Service (UPS) and FedEx by  preventing competition from a foreign-owned shipper. Within  months of inserting the provision, Rep. Blunt received almost  $20,000 in campaign contributions from the two companies. In  addition, Rep. Blunt's son, Andrew Blunt, worked as a lobbyist  for UPS.</p>
<p>   By accepting campaign contributions from Altria, UPS, and  FedEx, in apparent exchange for legislative assistance, Rep.  Blunt may have violated the federal bribery laws. 18 U.S.C.  Section 201(b)(2)(A). Furthermore, Rep. Blunt's introduction of  legislation that benefitted Philip Morris and UPS and, as a  consequence, his family members, may have violated a federal  regulation that prohibits members from taking official actions  for their own personal gain or that of anyone else. 5 CFR Section  2635.702(a). </p>
<p>   Rep. Blunt participated in an elaborate money-laundering  scheme with former House Majority Leader Tom DeLay (R-Texas)  during the 2000 presidential campaign. The scheme was designed to  hide the source and use of funds solicited for the expressed  purpose of financing Republican convention parties. Reps. Blunt  and DeLay intentionally raised funds in excess of what they  needed for the parties and diverted almost $100,000 to the  Missouri Republican Party to help finance Rep. Blunt's son, Matt  Blunt's, campaign for Secretary of State, a further violation of  5 CFR Section 2635.702(a) as well as House rules prohibiting  conduct that does not reflect creditably on the House.</p>
<p>   Rep. Blunt signed three letters to Interior Department  Secretary Gale Norton on behalf of Indian tribal clients of  former lobbyist and convicted felon Jack Abramoff and he opposed  legislation harmful to another Abramoff client, a garment  manufacturer in the Northern Marianas Islands. In return, Rep.  Blunt received campaign contributions from Abramoff and his  clients. Such conduct may have violated federal bribery laws.</p>
