<p>WASHINGTON - September 22 - The chemical industry reached a closed-door deal in cooperation with Senate and House negotiators Thursday night to add temporary chemical security provisions to the Department of Homeland Security appropriations bill. The temporary industry provisions, authorized to last for three years, would displace permanent and comprehensive chemical security bills unanimously approved by the House and Senate Homeland Security Committees this summer. 

 

<p>“The industry deal will take real chemical security solutions off the table and replace them with an inadequate temporary program,” said U.S. PIRG Staff Attorney Alex Fidis. “Congress is as close as it has ever been to passing permanent chemical security regulations, but a few lawmakers capitulating to the chemical industry’s demands will derail years of work to protect communities from chemical terrorism.”

 

<p>The industry proposal would establish a program that requires “high risk” facilities to conduct vulnerability assessments and develop security plans. The proposal tasks the Department of Homeland Security with identifying which of the more than 15,000 chemical facilities should be classified as high risk. Facilities not deemed high risk will not be required to implement any security measures.

 

<p>The industry proposal authorizes the Department to visit and inspect facilities, but explicitly prohibits the government from requiring specific security improvements at chemical plants. Consequently, decisions about which security measures to implement are left to the discretion of the chemical facility with minimal governmental input.

 

<p>“Absent government authority to mandate security, the industry proposal does nothing more than establish a rubber stamp program to legitimize the chemical industry’s security status quo,” said Fidis. “The proposal displaces comprehensive legislation and would result in shopping mall security at dangerous chemical plants.” 

 

<p>On Monday, House and Senate conferees will meet to reconcile differences between their competing bills. The industry proposal will be offered and could be approved during this conference.
