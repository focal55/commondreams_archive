<p>CHICAGO - February 23 - More than 25  million Americans --including nearly 9 million children and 3  million seniors -- receive emergency food assistance each year  from America's Second Harvest -- The Nation's Food Bank Network  of charitable agencies, representing an 8 percent increase since  2001, according to a report released today.  Hunger in America  2006, based on 52,000 face-to-face interviews with people seeking  emergency food assistance and more than 30,000 agency surveys, is  the largest, most-comprehensive study ever conducted on domestic  hunger.  The study was commissioned by the America's Second  Harvest Network and sponsored by Altria.</p>
<p>   &quot;It is tragic and alarming that more and more people are  relying on emergency food assistance in the United States, where  we produce enough food to feed every hungry person in the world,&quot;  said Robert Forney, President and CEO of the America's Second  Harvest Network.</p>
<p>   About 70 percent of the clients seeking emergency food  assistance are living below the federal poverty line, and nearly  40 percent have at least one adult working in their household.   Seventy percent of clients are living in food insecure  households-not knowing where they will find their next meal-and  33 percent of those clients reported experiencing hunger - that  is, being completely without a source of food.</p>
<p>   ai&quot;Millions of Americans rely every month on the agencies we serve. Millions of others are living less than one paycheck away from hunger,&quot; sd Forney.  &quot;When people hit sudden hard times  including illness, loss of a job, or disruption in health  insurance, they are forced to turn to the America's Second  Harvest Network for help.&quot;</p>
<p>   Many of the 52,000 clients who participated in face-to-face  interviews for Hunger in America 2006 reported having to make  difficult choices between food and everyday necessities.  More  than 40 percent of the clients served report having to choose  between paying for utilities or heating fuel and food; 35 percent  had to choose between paying for rent or a mortgage and food; 32  percent report having to choose between paying for medical bills  and food.</p>
<p>   &quot;Food is a basic human need and right,&quot; said Jennifer Goodale,  Vice President of Contributions, Altria Group, Inc., (parent  company of Kraft Foods - the nation's largest food and beverage  company).  &quot;As the sponsor of Hunger in America 2006, we hope the  study will inform public policy, energize the response among the  public and private sectors, and ultimately provide a better  understanding of the complex issue of hunger and the millions of  people it affects.&quot;</p>
<p>   Of the 25 million people the America's Second Harvest Network  serves, 39 percent are white; 38 percent are black; and 17  percent are Hispanic.</p>
<p>   Volunteers and faith-based organizations are the lifeline of  America's emergency food distribution system.  More than 65  percent of food pantries and 70 percent of soup kitchens rely  entirely on volunteers and have no paid staff.  As many as 90  percent of food pantries, 86 percent of soup kitchens and 71  percent of shelters in the America's Second Harvest Network use  volunteers.    Additionally, nearly 75 percent of pantries, 65  percent of soup kitchens, and 45 percent of emergency shelters  are run by faith-based agencies affiliated with churches,  mosques, synagogues and other religious organizations.</p>
<p>   &quot;The more than 1 million volunteers who support the America's  Second Harvest Network each year are critical to the work we do,  and ultimately to the improving the lives of the 25 million  Americans we serve each year,&quot; said Forney.</p>
<p>   The America's Second Harvest Network is the largest charitable  hunger-relief organization in the country with more than 200 food  banks and food-rescue organizations serving all fifty states, the  District of Columbia and Puerto Rico.  America's Second Harvest  Network Members distribute more than 2 billion pounds of food to  45,000 emergency agencies each year including 29,600 soup  kitchens, 5,600 food pantries; and 4,100 emergency shelters.</p>
<p>   An America's Second Harvest Network Member food bank or food- rescue organization provides 74 percent of the food distributed  by food pantries, 49 percent of the food distributed by soup  kitchens and 42 percent of the food distributed by emergency  shelters.  90 percent of the clients interviewed for Hunger in  America 2006 reported that they are satisfied with the quality  and quantity of food they receive from the America's Second  Harvest Network agency they visit.</p>
