<p>WASHINGTON - February 23 - Today, 12  organizations, led by Alliance for Justice and American Civil  Liberties Union, sent a letter to Congress opposing the  grassroots lobbying disclosure provisions currently included in  House and Senate lobbying reform bills.  While these nonprofits  applaud congressional efforts to eliminate corruption, they note  that the grassroots lobbying disclosure provisions as currently  written are redundant, problematic and infringe on the rights of  Americans to petition their elected representatives.
<p>   &quot;We must do everything we can to eliminate corruption in  today's lobbying practices, but we cannot do so at the expense of  free speech,&quot; noted Alliance for Justice President Nan Aron.   &quot;The grassroots lobbying reform provisions in these bills are  flawed and will interfere with the rights of Americans to receive  information about important public issues and to meaningfully  engage their elected representatives. These provisions infringe  on Americans' constitutional right to petition their government.&quot;</p>

<p>   &quot;These provisions, if adopted, would have a chilling effect on  the First Amendment rights of the American people,&quot; said Caroline  Fredrickson, Director of the ACLU Washington Legislative Office.   &quot;The right of the people to petition the government must not be  denied or abridged.  Congress can and should take steps to  address corruption and the undue influence of special interests  without sacrificing the rights of Americans to petition  government.&quot;  </p>
<p>   The text of the letter is available at  <a href="http://releases.usnewswire.com/redir.asp?ReleaseID=61405&Link=http://www.allianceforjustice.org/grlrletter.pdf">http://www.allianceforjustice.org/grlrletter.pdf</a>.  </p>
