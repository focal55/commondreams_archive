<p>WASHINGTON - April 28 - In what is being described as a &quot;dramatic change of course 
              for GOP leaders,&quot; (The Hill, April 27) Majority Leader John 
              Boehner has told his caucus of House Republicans that he supports 
              a full and lengthy floor debate on the war in Iraq. The change comes 
              on the heels of a two-week national grass-roots campaign by the 
              Win Without War coalition demanding that House members sign a resolution 
              that would force a seventeen hour debate on the floor of the House 
              where all alternatives to the Bush war in Iraq would receive an 
up-or-down vote.
<p>The bipartisan resolution has already been signed by Republican 
              Representatives Walter Jones (R-NC), Jim Leach (R-IA), Wayne Gilchrest 
              (R-MD.), Ron Paul (R-TX) and Howard Coble (R-NC), and 101 of their 
              Democratic allies.</p>
            <p>&quot;While members of Congress may not always be able to see the 
              light, they can always feel the heat,&quot; said Win Without War 
              National Director Tom Andrews, former Member of Congress from Maine. 
              &quot;Now we need to make certain that House Republican leaders 
              do not try a parliamentary sleight of hand to distort and limit 
              a debate on the Iraq war.&quot;</p>
            <p>Andrews warned that Republican leaders might be tempted to limit 
              debate and restrict alternatives from being considered. Win Without 
              War has been supporting House Resolution 543 that calls for an immediate 
              seventeen-hour debate where all alternatives to the Bush war are 
              allowed onto the floor for consideration and vote. &quot;Anything 
              short of an open debate that allows ALL alternatives to be presented 
              will be unacceptable. We need to make sure that this bottom-line 
              is protected.&quot;</p>
            <p>The coalition launched a national campaign two weeks ago as members 
              of Congress returned home for the April recess. A web site created 
              for the campaign, www.openiraqdebate.org, has already received more 
              than a quarter million hits as thousands of coalition members wrote, 
              called or visited their member of Congress demanding an open debate 
              and vote on alternatives to the Bush war in Iraq. A print and radio 
ad campaign was launched in Minnesota and Ohio.</p>
