<p> WASHINGTON - August 3 - <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">After repeatedly opposing
    any increase in the minimum wage, the majority's leadership in the U.S. House
    of Representatives
    on July 29 cynically passed <strong>House Resolution
    (H.R.) 5970,</strong>
    a bill combining a wage boost with language gutting the estate tax and a
    package of corporate tax break extensions popular with the business community.
    Each year the bill would give several thousand extremely wealthy families
    an average estate tax break of well over a million dollars. </font>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The majority hopes
    that this bill with be more likely to pass in the Senate, where Majority
    Leader Bill Frist
    (R-TN) has failed several times now in his efforts to repeal or reduce the
    estate tax. The latest information is that the Senate will probably vote
    on late Thursday night, August 3.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The minimum wage is at its lowest
    purchasing power since 1955. Lawmakers and organizations that have advocated
    boosting the minimum wage have blasted the House for linking this important
    change to an estate tax cut that will expand federal budget deficits by hundreds
    of billions of dollars. </font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Provisions of H.R. 5970</strong></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The <strong>minimum wage</strong> provisions
    of the bill would increase the wage floor from its current $5.15 to $5.85
    on January 1, 2007, then to $6.55 on June 1, 2008, and $7.25 on June 1, 2009.
    Remarkably, the bill would actually cut wages for workers in certain states,
    as explained by the <a href="http://www.epi.org/content.cfm/pm114">Economic
    Policy Institute</a>. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Under legislation enacted in 2001,
    the <strong>estate tax</strong> is gradually being phased out and is to disappear
    entirely in 2010 but then return almost fully in 2011. H.R. 5970 would change
    this so that the estate tax does not disappear in 2010 but will be permanently
    and significantly lower. Between 2010 and 2015, H.R. 5970 would gradually
    phase in higher exemptions and lower rates. Once fully in effect in 2015,
    the bill would exempt the first $5 million of an individual's estate (or
    $10 million of a couple's estate) and would tax the value of the estate between
    the exempt amount and $25 million at the capital gains tax rate, which is
    currently 15 percent. Any value of an estate beyond $25 million would be
    taxed at 30 percent. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Once the estate tax cut is fully
    in effect, it will cost over <a href="http://www.cbpp.org/7-28-06tax3.htm">$61
    billion</a> a year.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Also included in the bill is a <strong>package
      of tax break extensions</strong> that are largely aimed at business. Some
      of these tax breaks have questionable value but nevertheless have bipartisan
      support. The largest is the research and development tax credit followed
      by the deduction for state sales taxes.</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"></font></p>

      Incentives:<br>
  Congress Poised
      to Extend Special Tax Advantages to Wealthy Families <br>
    In Guise of &#8220;Savings
  Incentives&#8221;</font></strong></H1>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The U.S. House
      of Representatives passed a pension reform bill, H.R. 4, on July 28 that
      would
    make permanent so-called &#8220;savings incentives&#8221; benefitting
  higher-income families who need the least help in trying to save. <br>
  The legislation, which could go to the floor of the Senate for final approval
  sometime in the next few days, has received attention mostly because of its
  provisions dealing with traditional pensions. What has been less noted in the
  press is that the bill makes permanent provisions of the 2001 tax break legislation
  that raised the contribution limits for Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs)
  and 401(k) plans. </font></H1>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The problem
      is that almost no one was making the maximum allowable contributions to
      these savings
    vehicles even before the limits were
    increased (only 6 percent reached the limit for IRAs and only 2 percent for
    401(k)s in 2000, before tax break package was enacted). The small percentage
    of people who are affected by the limit are mostly upper-income people &#8212; meaning
    that this provision is generally a subsidy for wealthy families&#8217; retirement
  savings.</font>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Senate will probably
    vote on the pension bill Thursday August 3.<br>
    </font>
    </H1>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>How the Proposed Tax Break Would Work</strong> </font></H1>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Wealthy families
      do not need help saving as much as low- and middle-income families. The
      most
    likely response from
      wealthy families is not to save more money but rather to move money that
      is already
    being saved into one of these tax-sheltered accounts. It is therefore not
      surprising that Congress&#8217;s tax breaks that are ostensibly to encourage
      savings accomplish nothing of the sort. The contributions limits were raised
      in 2001 and the rate
    of personal savings in the United States has continued to decline and was
      negative in 2005 for the first time since the Great Depression.<br>
    </font></H1>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Senate
      should return to the language it passed earlier this year, which did not
      include
    extensions of the provisions enacted in 2001 that relate
      to IRAs and 401(k)s. Extending these tax breaks at a time when Congress
    and the
      President are running deficits would make any talk of &#8220;encouraging savings&#8221; doubly
      outrageous, since it offers tax shelters without encouraging new saving
      while simultaneously increasing the national debt by tens of billions of
      dollars.</font></H1>

<H1 align="left"><font color="#0000FF" size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Business
    Activity Tax:<strong><br>
  House Delays Bill to Help Corporations Escape State Taxes </strong></font></H1>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the face of opposition
    from the National Governors's Association and other groups, the House of
    Representatives delayed until September a vote on the Business Activity
  Tax Simplification Act (BATSA), which has the stated purpose of creating simpler
  and less burdensome rules to determine when a state government can tax the
  profits of an out-of-state company. While simplification sounds like a good
  idea, it's not what this bill does. BATSA actually makes it easier for large,
  multistate companies to avoid paying their fair share of taxes. The bill applies
  a &quot;physical presence&quot; test to determine whether or not a company
  selling a service from out-of-state can be taxed, but includes a variety of
  loopholes that will ensure that many companies' profits are not taxed at all.
  The Congressional Budget Office has found that by 2011 this bill, if enacted,
  would cost states $3 billion annually.<br>
</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>What does this mean
  to people who are not tax attorneys? </strong></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">First, Congress is
    basically giving a lot of large, multistate corporations an annual $3 billion
    tax break through this bill and it&#8217;s the states that have to pay for
    it. This means less money for schools, roads, the DMV and whatever it is
    that states need to fund, and we know how delicate the states&#8217; fiscal
    health can be.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Second, under BATSA,
    large multistate companies would have new opportunities to avoid taxes that
    smaller home-grown companies would not enjoy, regardless of which carried
    out a more productive business in the state. Most people would have a hard
    time understanding why out-of-state companies trying to sell them services
    should receive more tax advantages than locally-owned businesses in their
    neighborhoods.</font></p>
<p align="left"><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  What's wrong with the current rules and how would BATSA change them?</font></strong></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It&#8217;s true that
    there is some confusion and litigation over the current rules, but not as
    much as there will be if this bill is enacted. Congress passed what was supposed
    to be a temporary law back in 1959 that said a state can&#8217;t tax the
    income of a company that sells products to people in the state but ships
    them from out-of-state and takes the orders at an out-of-state location.
    In other words, the company has to be &#8220;physically present&#8221; in
    the state before it can be taxed, but physical presence is defined in a strange
    way. Say a company takes orders from a location in State A and ships its
    products from State A. It could sell 90 percent of its products to State
    B and send hundreds of trucks and thousands of salespeople into State B but
    it still can&#8217;t be taxed by State B. So this was never a great law but
  it&#8217;s still on the books.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For other types of
    sales, like the sale of services, that law didn&#8217;t
  apply. Many states tax out-of-state companies in proportion to the fraction
  of the company&#8217;s sales that are directed into the state. If 50 percent
  of a companies sales are to residents of my state I would probably find it
  reasonable that my state apply its corporate income tax to 50 percent of the
  company&#8217;s income. Since states do have different standards there has
  been some confusion and litigation but not as much as we would see under BATSA.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Unfortunately, BATSA
    takes the law enacted in 1959 that currently covers physical goods shipped
    from out-of-state and extends it to cover other sales and then writes in
    a bunch of loopholes to shield a lot of corporate profits from state taxes.
    The basic idea sounds deceptively simple. The income of a company doing business
    in a particular state can be taxed only if it has a &#8220;physical presence&#8221; in
    that state for more than 21 days out of the tax year. But the bill contains
    many &#8220;safe harbors&#8221; &#8212; exceptions basically. For example,
    a manufacturer could ship unfinished products into a state to have them completed
    and then shipped back out without triggering the physical presence rule.
    Or a company that sends service people into a particular state can create
    subsidiaries that go into the state for no more than 21 days each to avoid
    meeting the rule&#8217;s physical presence threshold. Companies could maneuver
  to avoid paying taxes in states where it is clearly doing business.</font></p>

      Rules That Would Slash Services Americans Depend On<br>
  While Protecting Tax Breaks for the Rich</font></strong></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Despite the fact that
    tax breaks enacted since 2001 are responsible for almost <a href="http://www.cbpp.org/budget-slideshow.htm">half</a> of the U.S.
    federal budget deficit, President Bush and Republican
  leaders in Congress claim that they need new budget rules that will encourage
  deep cuts in federal programs &#8212; but mandate no changes in tax policy &#8212; in
  order to get deficits under control. Fortunately the full Senate has not approved
  any such plans at this time and is not likely to before leaving for their month-long
  August recess.<br>
</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Line-Item Veto</strong></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On
      June 22, the U.S. House of Representatives voted to approve a bill that
    would give the President &#8220;line-item veto&#8221; authority
      to strip out certain spending provisions from bills and force Congress to
      reconsider them while he withholds the funds. Almost no tax-break provisions
      could be
      stripped out this way under the bill. <br>
    <br>
    - Unprecedented Presidential power: The legislation would allow the President
      to single out spending provisions in an appropriation bill (or a bill to
  expand entitlements), withhold funds and force Congress to vote to approve
      or reject
      the rescission (cancellation of the spending). The President would be allowed
      to withhold funds for a total of 90 days, even if Congress rejects the
      rescission. <br>
    <br>
    -    Tax breaks for special interests protected: The President proposed
      that he be given the authority to use the line-item veto to strip any spending
      provision
      or entitlement increase, but could only strip tax break provisions benefitting
      fewer than 100 people. For example, a tax break that benefits one half
      of one percent of Americans would be protected, because it benefits more
      than
      100
      people. Even that rule wasn&#8217;t enough for the House, which decided that
      tax breaks needed even more protection. The version passed by the House says
      that only tax breaks benefitting a single person or company can be stripped.
      Even then, an exception exists whenever the chairmen of the tax-writing committees
      (the people who write the tax break provisions in the first place) say they
      think the tax break should be protected from the line-item veto!<br>
    <br>
    -    Little chance of reducing deficits: A recent study of the line-item
      veto by the Congressional Budget Office concludes that it is not likely
      to reduce
      overall
      deficits anyway. Rather, its real effect would be to increase the power
      of the executive branch, which could use the threat of the line-item veto
      to
      spur legislators to go along with the President&#8217;s agenda, even if it
      involves increasing spending in certain areas or enacting tax breaks that
      are not
      paid for. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><br>
  Additional Spending Restraints Not Moving In Senate</strong></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> On June 20 the Senate
    Budget Committee approved a bill sponsored by its chairman, Senator Judd
    Gregg,
    that included the line-item veto
    plus more <a href="http://www.cbpp.org/6-19-06bud.htm">sweeping budget changes</a> that would, again, aim to reduce spending
    but protect tax breaks. Like the House bill, Gregg&#8217;s proposal gives
    the tax-writing chairmen enough influence to protect their pet tax break
    provisions. Realizing that there might not be votes for the line-item veto
    language, much less other budget restraints, Senator Gregg recently said
    he was open to supporting the line-item veto by itself without the other
    provisions he crafted. <br>
</font></p>
<p align="left"><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">House May Take Up Sunset
    Commission Bill Upon Returning From August Recess</font></strong></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Republican leaders
    in the House pulled from the floor two bills that would establish <a href="http://www.ombwatch.org/article/articleview/3521/1/330?TopicID=1">&quot;sunset
    commissions.&quot;</a> These commissions would essentially review government
    programs and agencies and make proposals for cuts or eliminations to Congress,
    where
    they would not be subject to normal legislative procedures. Both bills
    present a departure from the bipartisan commissions that have worked effectively
    in
    the past.
    A majority of commissioners could be appointed by Republicans and would not
    need the
    input
    of Democrat-appointed commissioners. Their proposals could pass Congress
    without a single Democratic vote. Under both bills, the commission would
    not look at various tax breaks and tax expenditures that cost the American
    taxpayer hundreds of billions of dollars. </font></p>
<p align="left"><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  Congress Not Considering The One Proven Budget Reform Measure &#8212; PAYGO</font></strong></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The pay-as-you-go (PAYGO)
    rules helped President Clinton and Congress reduce deficits in the 1990s
    by requiring spending increases and
    tax breaks to be offset by either spending reductions or tax increases elsewhere,
    so that the overall effect would not be an increase in the deficit. Congress
    allowed the PAYGO rules to expire in 2002 because they endangered President
    Bush&#8217;s tax cuts for the wealthy. Indeed, last year Congress
    used budget rules to make a budget filibuster-proof even though it increased
    deficits by including tax breaks benefitting the wealthy that outweighed
    the cuts in services used by low-income people.</font></p>
