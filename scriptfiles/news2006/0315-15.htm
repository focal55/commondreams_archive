<p>NEW YORK  - March 15 - Completing a key phase of their yearlong campaign aimed at 
inspiring young Americans to defend civil liberties, the American Civil 
Liberties Union today announced the winners of the second annual Stand Up for 
Freedom Contest.&nbsp; Launched on July 4th, 2005, the competition challenged 
young people across the country to get creative about defending their rights by 
producing a TV public service announcement (PSA) or writing an essay on today&#8217;s 
pressing civil liberties issues.&nbsp; <BR>
&nbsp;<BR>
Lauren Humphrey, a recent 
graduate of the University of Southern California, took the $5,000 award in the 
PSA category for her submission &#8220;You Do,&#8221; which focuses on the invasiveness of 
the Patriot Act.&nbsp; In the writing category, the $1,000 prize was awarded to 
Steven Gaughan for his submission &#8220;Hide and Seek,&#8221; a powerful piece on 
censorship. 
<P>&#8220;While we received many impressive entries, Lauren Humphrey and Steven 
Gaughan exhibited outstanding creativity and thoughtfulness in their responses 
to our challenge,&#8221; said ACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero. &#8220;In a time 
when many of our core freedoms are in jeopardy, it is encouraging to see young 
people defending civil liberties with such energy and imagination.&#8221; </P>
<P>A pool of more than 3,500 entries was narrowed down to seven finalists in 
each category, and a panel of acclaimed celebrities selected the two 
winners.&nbsp; Judges included filmmakers Ron Howard, Reginald Hudlin and 
Warrington Hudlin; award-winning musicians Carlos Santana and Rob Thomas; 
authors Cheryl Howard, Deborah Santana and Jessica Blank; philanthropist Marisol 
Thomas; Judge Alex Kozinski of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth 
Circuit; New York Film Festival Director Richard Pe&#241;a; HBO Entertainment 
President Carolyn Strauss; and ACLU Executive Director Anthony Romero.</P>
<P>The ACLU said the contest is a key part of its campaign to engage the next 
generation of civil libertarians.&nbsp; This ongoing effort continues with the 
launch of StandUp (www.aclu.org/standup) the ACLU&#8217;s new Web 
site for students and young people.&nbsp; StandUp spotlights bold and inspiring 
entries from the recent contest and also features live streaming of Listen Up 
for Freedom, an ACLU-branded CD sampler featuring unreleased songs from top 
Atlantic Records artists.</P>
