<p> WHAT: American Rights at Work to Host Second Annual Eleanor Roosevelt Human Rights Awards Celebration

<p>WHEN: Thursday, April 6, 2006, 5 to 7p.m

<p>WHERE: National Museum of Women in the Arts, Washington, DC

<p>Tom Morello will be recognized for the support the outspoken musician has given to workers fighting for justice, and for bringing together musicians and activists to take on corporate giants. Morello devotes his time, organizes benefit concerts, and even engages in civil disobedience in support of workers' rights. Just some of the labor struggles he has taken action on include the Los Angeles janitors' strike and the Southern California grocery workers' strike and lockout. Morello was inspired by the political conscience of his mother, civil rights and free speech advocate Mary Morello, and father, Kenyan revolutionary Ngethe Njoroge

<p>Danny Glover will be celebrated for the energy the award- winning actor and activist brings to improving the lives of hotel workers and their families. The son of postal workers and active union members in San Francisco, Glover's political awareness was shaped by his parents' involvement with the civil rights and workers' rights movements.
<p>
Glover is routinely found marching alongside those fighting for their rights, from immigrant nursing home workers in Florida struggling to form a union, to campus workers at Washington University trying to earn a living wage. Most recently, he embarked on a multi-city tour with UNITE HERE's Hotel Workers Rising campaign. Through this initiative, Glover is supporting workers who are fighting against what has become all too common in the hotel industry: long hours, low wages, and discrimination.

<p>The award is named after Eleanor Roosevelt, a long-time union member who was instrumental in the passage of the UN's Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

<p>Additional information about the event can be found at http://www.americanrightsatwork.org/events/er2006/

<p>To schedule a time to interview Tom Morello, Danny Glover or a spokesperson from American Rights at Work, please contact John Anthony at 202-822-2127 ext. 118, or via email at janthony@americanrightsatwork.org.
