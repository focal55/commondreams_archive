<p>FORT MYERS, Florida - July 18 - Department of Children and Families (DCF) districts that take proportionately fewer children from their parents often do a much better job keeping children safe than those still wedded to a "take-the- child-and-run" approach, according to a national child advocacy organization.

<p>Using data obtained through a public records request, the National Coalition for Child Protection Reform (NCCPR) found that DCF districts taking fewer children also tend to have less re- abuse of children left in their own homes and fewer children forced to return to foster care after being reunited with their families.

<p>The data are included in a report NCCPR released today in Fort Myers, Fla., the organization's fourth report on Florida child welfare. It includes specific data for every DCF district, district-by-district comparisons and more than a dozen recommendations for reform.

<p>Statewide, Florida continues to suffer from the "take-the- child-and-run" approach demanded by disgraced former DCF Secretary Kathleen Kearney, said NCCPR Executive Director Richard Wexler. "Kearney set off the mother of all foster-care panics," Wexler said. "The number of children taken from their parents soared 50 percent in a single year, 1999 -- and to this day children continue to be removed at nearly this same rate -- a rate about 35 percent above the national average, and more than double the rate in model systems. Indeed, in 2005, the number of children removed from their parents in Florida reached a record high of more than 22,000."

<p>Kearney meant well, Wexler said. "She thought it would protect children. But the panic backfired. Deaths of children known-to- DCF have increased by 36 percent. And in 2004, a record 48 such children died. Then, last month, the legislature's Office of Program Policy Analysis and Government Accountability found that from 1998, the last full year before the panic, through mid-2005, a more reliable measure of safety -- reabuse of children left in their own homes -- soared by 50 percent. 

<p>"Now, data NCCPR has obtained, comparing each district's rate- of-removal to key safety measures confirm it: Taking away more and more children does nothing to improve child safety -- in fact it makes children less safe," Wexler said. "That's because foster-care panics so overwhelm caseworkers with children who don't need to be taken away that they have even less time to find children in real danger."

<p>"For example, in 2005, a child in District 13 in central Florida was seven times more likely to be torn from his or her parents than a child in the Miami area. But Miami's children are safer. Children in District 13 who are left in their own homes after a substantiated allegation of maltreatment are nearly twice as likely to be abused again as their Miami counterparts.”

<p>In addition to the statewide report, NCCPR released an expanded edition for the Fort Myers area, including a discussion of the foster-care panic now sweeping through the region and specific recommendations for the area. That report is available at <a href="http://www.nccpr.org/reports/everybodysproblemfinal13811.doc" target="_new">http://www.nccpr.org/reports/everybodysproblemfinal13811.doc</a>. 

<p><b>EDITOR'S NOTE:</b> The full report discussed below is available online by cutting and pasting, or typing, this case-sensitive URL directly into a web browser: <a href="http://www.nccpr.org/reports/priceofpanic1311.doc" target="_new">http://www.nccpr.org/reports/priceofpanic1311.doc</a>.

<p>The report discusses the number of children removed from their homes over the course of a year -- not the number of children in foster care on any given day.
