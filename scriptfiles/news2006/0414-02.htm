<p>WASHINGTON - April 14 - Green Party candidates and leaders faulted Democrats for 
refusing to hold President Bush and his administration accountable for a 
mounting list of high crimes and misdemeanors.

<p>"Hardly a month goes by without major new evidence that the Bush White House 
has lied to the American people," said Byron DeLear, Green candidate for 
Congress in California's 28th District <http://www.delearforcongress.org>.  
"Democratic leaders and moderate Republicans in Congress have hardly 
mustered a peep of collective protest.  Rep. John Conyers [D-Mich.] has 
introduced a House resolution calling for investigation and possible 
impeachment; Sen. Russell Feingold [D-Wisc.] has prepared a motion for 
censure.  But their fellow Democrats have declined to join them."

<p>The Green Party of the United States called for impeachment of President 
Bush initially in July 2003, citing widespread and deliberate deception in 
making the case for invasion of Iraq, as well as numerous violations of the 
U.S. Constitution and international law to which the U.S. is signatory 
<http://www.gp.org/press/pr_07_21_03.html>.  As further evidence of White 
House deceit and crimes have surfaced, Greens have reiterated the demand for 
impeachment <http://www.gp.org/press/pr_2005_06_09.shtml> 
<http://www.gp.org/press/pr_2006_01_03.shtml>.

<p><b>Among recent revelations:
</b>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Lewis 'Scooter' Libby's April 6 testimony that President Bush himself 
authorized the leak disclosing Valerie Plame's CIA employment indicates that 
Mr. Bush knowingly withheld material evidence from the grand jury 
investigation of reporter Judith Miller.  The White House has not denied Mr. 
Libby's allegation; the obstruction of evidence -- a possible felony -- was 
clearly motivated by politics rather than national security.<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>In 2003, President Bush continued to allege that two trailers captured in 
Iraq were mobile biological weapons laboratories, even after Defense 
Intelligence Agency had informed the White House that the facilities had 
nothing to do with biological weapons.  (Reuters, April 12, 2006, <http://www.commondreams.org/headlines06/0412-04.htm>)<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>According to a confidential memo from Prime Minister Tony Blair's office 
revealed  in The New York Times on March 27, 2006 <http://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/27/international/europe/27memo.html?ex=1144040400\
&en=e6fb1beca94bbb24&ei=5070&emc=eta1>, President Bush told Mr. Blair that 
he was determined to invade Iraq without a second U.N. resolution and 
regardless of whether arms inspectors failed to find Saddam Hussein's 
purported WMDs.  The report confirms evidence in the Downing Street memo <http://www.afterdowningstreet.org> that Mr. Bush was set on in invasion and 
that intelligence and information fed to the public were "fixed", i.e., 
manipulated to support his intentions. </li>
</ul>
<p>Greens note that these revelations are consistent with President Bush's 
assertion that he had the right to order the National Security Agency to 
engage in surveillance against U.S. citizens without a warrant in accord 
with the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) and the Fourth 
Amendment.

<p>"These new crimes are hardly surprising to those of us who recognized the 
fraud behind the war from the very beginning and the vote obstruction in the 
2004 national election," said Michael Berg, who is seeking the Green 
nomination for Delaware's lone seat in the House of Representatives 
<http://www.bergforcongress.us>.  "As the mountain of evidence of high 
crimes and misdemeanors has grown, so has the cowardice of the Democratic 
Party leadership."

<p>"It is criminal that the Democratic elected officials allowed this country 
to invade Iraq, and it is criminal that they continue to support an illegal 
war," added Aaron Dixon, Green candidate for the U.S. Senate in Washington 
<http://www.aarondixon.org>.
