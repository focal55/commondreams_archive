<p>MIAMI, FL - At 1 PM on Tuesday, March 28th students at the University of Miami initiated a sit in the school's admission's office in
order to push University President Donna Shalala to support campus janitors currently on strike.  However, Shalala has not allowed
students access to food, water or bathroom facilities, forcing them into an unplanned hunger strike.  

<p>When asked if students could access food from the outside, Shalala responded, "I'm not feeding the strike!"  

<p>Students say they are willing to make this sacrifice until Shalala demands that UNICCO, the janitors' direct employer contracted out
by the University, recognize the workers' union once a majority of the employees have signed cards authorizing the union to
represent them.

<p>"We tried to meet with Shalala several times before sitting in," said Amancio Paradela "but nothing seemed to work."

<p>Shalala did agree to form a working group to study the compensation and benefits issues facing the contract employees at the
University and suggested she might raise wages and provide health benefits.  But the workers are still on strike, noting that a
union would be able to provide them with the long term protections they really need with UNICCO.

<p>Students are doing this in conjunction with the National Student-Labor Week of Action which includes demonstrations at over 200
universities
nationwide.     Organized annually by the Student Labor Action Project
(SLAP), the week focuses on corporate interests on campus, including campus administrators that act more in the interest of Big
Business than those who make a campus tic-workers and students. 

<p>"Neither students or workers should have their education nor jobs compromised so campus-based corporations like UNICCO can make more
money," said Carl Lipscombe, the National Coordinator of SLAP.  

<p>The students say they are willing to make this sacrifice if it pushes the janitors closer to their goals.

<p>The Student Labor Action Project (SLAP) is a joint program of Jobs with Justice-a nationwide network of community-labor coalitions,
and the United States Student Association-the oldest and largest organization representing students on Capitol Hill.  The week is
co-coordinated this year by the United Students Against Sweatshops, the Living Wage Action Coalition, the Student/Farm worker
Alliance, the National Movimiento Estudiantil Chicana/o de Aztlan (MEChA), Not with Our Money, and Student Action with Farm workers.
