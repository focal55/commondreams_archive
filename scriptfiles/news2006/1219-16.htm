<p>PITTSBURGH - December 19 - The American Civil Liberties Union of Pennsylvania today filed a 
federal lawsuit on behalf of a former Beaver County student charging that the 
school district violated the student&#8217;s First Amendment rights when it punished 
him for a single, spontaneous remark he made in response to repeated 
teasing.</P>
<P>The lawsuit against the New Brighton Area School District was filed in U.S. 
District Court on behalf of 18-year-old Cory Johnson. Johnson was a senior at 
New Brighton Area High School when a former Harlem Globetrotter &#8212; invited by the 
school to give a motivational talk to students &#8212; called Johnson &#8220;Osama bin 
Laden&#8221; in reference to his scruffy goatee.&nbsp;&nbsp; The next day, students 
and at least one teacher taunted Johnson by calling him Osama bin Laden.&nbsp; 
Frustrated by the teasing, Johnson said to a friend, &#8220;If I were Osama, I would 
already have pulled a Columbine.&#8221;&nbsp; A teacher who overheard the remark 
reported it to school administrators.&nbsp; They suspended Johnson for 10 days 
and banned him from his senior prom for the remark, which they claimed was a 
&#8220;terroristic threat.&#8221;</P>
<P>&#8220;This is yet another example of school officials overreacting and punishing 
student speech when there is no evidence that Cory&#8217;s remark was a threat or that 
he was a danger to the school,&#8221; said Sara Rose, an ACLU of Pennsylvania staff 
attorney.&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;While schools need to be vigilant in responding to true 
threats of violence, overreactions by school administrators victimize and punish 
innocent students like Cory Johnson.&#8221;</P>
<P>Johnson told school administrators who questioned him about the remark that 
he intended it as a joke.&nbsp; He said that it never occurred to him that 
anyone would consider the remark threatening, especially given the way in which 
he said it and that he said it privately to a friend.&nbsp; </P>
<P>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t say it like I meant it,&#8221; Johnson said. &#8220;I even laughed after I had 
made the remark and hugged the girl who I said it to.&#8221;</P>
<P>In today&#8217;s lawsuit, the ACLU asks the court to rule that the school&#8217;s 
suspension of Johnson violated his free-speech rights under the First Amendment 
of the Constitution, and order the school district to pay damages to Johnson for 
the violation.&nbsp; </P>
<P>The case is <EM>Johnson v. New Brighton Area School District, et al.</EM> </P>
