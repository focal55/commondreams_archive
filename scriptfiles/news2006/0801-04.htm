<p>WASHINGTON - August 1 - Based on information obtained by National Security Whistleblowers Coalition, Mr. Russell Tice’s appearance before the federal grand jury originally scheduled for Wednesday, August 2, has been cancelled.
<p><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black">On Wednesday, July 26, Russell Tice, former National Security Agency (NSA) intelligence analyst and a member of National Security Whistleblowers Coalition (<A href="http://nswbc.org/" target="_new">NSWBC</A>), was approached outside&nbsp;his home by two FBI agents who served him with a subpoena to testify in front of a federal grand jury. NSWBC obtained a copy of the subpoena issued for Mr. Tice&rsquo;s testimony and released it to the public for the first time. The subpoena directed Mr. Tice to appear before the jury on August 2, 2006 at 1:00 p.m. in the Eastern District of Virginia. [To view the subpoena </SPAN><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: blue"><A

<p>Mr. Josh Dratel, the New York criminal defense lawyer who represents Mr. Tice, sent a letter, which was received by the Department of Justice on Friday, July 28, requesting additional information and time to prepare. The Department of Justice granted the request and postponed the scheduled appearance of Mr. Tice before the Federal Grand Jury. No new date has been set. 
<p><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black"><A 
href="http://www.nswbc.org/nswbc_staff.htm" target="_new">Professor William Weaver</A>, NSWBC Senior Advisor, stated: "The subpoena for Mr. Tice did not indicate whether or not he was the target of a criminal investigation or just a witness, and gave him only six days to prepare for the original grand jury hearing date.&nbsp; The intervention of first class legal counsel put the government off track,&nbsp;for&nbsp;it appears that government attorneys wanted to get to Tice before he had a chance to obtain legal advice."<o:p></o:p></SPAN>
