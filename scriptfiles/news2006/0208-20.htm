<P>JERUSALEM - February 8 - The Israel Defense Forces' top judicial 
officer should demonstrate his resolve to combat impunity by 
immediately ordering thorough and effective criminal investigations into 
the latest shooting deaths of Palestinian children by Israeli forces during 
policing operations, Human Rights Watch said today.

<P>The Israeli military's judge advocate general, Brigadier-General Avihai 
Mandelblit, in December told a gathering of Israeli nongovernmental 
organizations in Jerusalem that the number of criminal investigations 
was increasing under his tenure, which began in October 2004. He 
asserted that the total number of criminal investigations since September 
2000 had now reached 200.   
  
<P>In June 2005, the judge advocate general's office announced that it had 
opened only 131 criminal investigations into the unlawful death and 
injury of Palestinians at the hands of the Israel Defense Forces since the 
current intifada began in September 2000. During that same period, 
outside any combat situation, Israeli soldiers killed at least 1,722 
Palestinians - more than one-third of whom were children - and injured 
thousands more, according to the Israeli human rights group B'Tselem. 
But since September 2000, the judge advocate general's office has 
announced only 28 indictments and seven convictions of Israeli soldiers 
on charges related to unlawful killing or injury.   
  
<P>"The Israeli military's failure to conduct effective investigations into 
civilian killings has fostered impunity in its ranks," said Sarah Leah 
Whitson, Middle East director at Human Rights Watch. "Increasing the 
number of investigations is a step in the right direction and must 
continue, but the ultimate test is whether they bring wrongdoers to 
justice."   
  
<P>On January 23, Israeli soldiers shot a 13-year-old Palestinian boy in the 
back as he walked along a West Bank road reserved for Jewish settlers. 
The boy, Munadel Abu Aalia, from the nearby village of El-Mughayer 
(near Ramallah), died the same day. After first telling the press that the 
boy and his friends were planning to throw stones at settler cars, Israeli 
military officials then told journalists that the boys were planting an 
explosive device.   
  
<P>The Israel Defense Forces' allegation that the boy posed a threat should 
not preempt a criminal investigation since media accounts suggest that 
the incident occurred outside the context of any exchange of fire, he was 
shot in the back, he reportedly was far from any conceivable target when 
he was shot, and the incident occurred in broad daylight. The soldiers 
did not fire warning shots or attempt to question or arrest the boys first.   
  
<P>In a second incident, soldiers patrolling Israel's border with the Gaza 
Strip on January 26 shot dead a 9-year-old Palestinian girl on the other 
side, not far from her home in Khan Younis. Gaza-based human rights 
organizations investigating the case found that Israeli forces had opened 
indiscriminate fire on Aya al-Astal without warning when they saw 
something moving near the border.   
  
<P>Afterwards, the Israeli military contacted Palestinian security officials in 
Gaza to announce that their "soldiers shot and hit a terrorist." The girl's 
mother told the press, however, that her daughter was small, unveiled 
and should have been easily identifiable as a child. Her father said that 
she was mentally disabled and had become lost after wandering from the 
house. According to the girl's family and paramedics, the girl was shot 
multiple times in the neck, leg, arm and stomach. The Israel Defense 
Forces have not accounted for the mistaken identity or their rules of 
engagement at the border, warranting an immediate criminal 
investigation.   
  
<P>As noted above, both of these shooting deaths occurred outside the 
context of any armed conflict or exchange of fire. In such situations, 
even if the victim is engaged in criminal conduct, Israeli security forces 
should have been operating according to international law enforcement 
standards, which are governed by the U.N. Basic Principles on the Use 
of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials and the U.N. Code 
of Conduct for Law Enforcement Officials.   
  
<P>According to these international standards for policing, security forces 
should resort to the intentional use of lethal force only when it is 
"strictly unavoidable in order to protect life." As noted above, 
eyewitness accounts and the pattern of lethal injuries on the two children 
indicate a serious breach of these standards.   
  
<P>While the Israel Defense Forces immediately announced their intention 
to open a probe into the death of the boy, the military's spokesperson 
was unable to tell Human Rights Watch whether they had opened a 
similar probe in the case of the girl. However, the media reported that an 
internal probe was launched in the girl's case, and that the judge 
advocate general's office had already found no fault in the judgment 
used by the unit commander and found that the shooting was carried out 
according to open fire regulations.   
  
<P>However, the military's spokesperson told Human Rights Watch that the 
inquiry into the boy's death was an internal army probe, or "operational 
debrief." In a report published in June, Human Rights Watch 
documented how these debriefs fall far short of international standards 
for criminal investigations, and fail to establish the truth and bring 
perpetrators to justice.   
  
<P>First, the debriefs rely solely on the testimony of the implicated soldiers 
and are often carried out by the soldiers' peers in the same unit. 
International standards dictate that investigators must be effectively 
independent from those implicated. The debriefs do not seek or consider 
testimony from victims or non-military witnesses, and do not attempt to 
reconcile discrepancies between the soldiers' accounts and evidence 
presented by eyewitnesses, medical authorities or video. In the past, 
these debriefs have seriously delayed and impeded any criminal 
investigation.   
  
<P>In addition, the Israeli government has failed to provide an effective 
remedy including fair and adequate compensation to victims of grave 
human rights violations. As Human Rights Watch outlined in a letter to 
members of the Israeli Knesset, the State Liability Law as amended by 
the Knesset in July now makes it extremely difficult for Palestinians 
injured by Israeli security forces to sue for compensation in Israeli 
courts.
