<p>WASHINGTON - October 4 - In a letter sent  today to the House Ethics Committee, Democracy 21 President Fred  Wertheimer called on the Committee to appoint an outside counsel  to conduct an independent investigation of House Republican  leaders and how they dealt with the House page scandal that led  former Representative Mark Foley (R-Fla.) to resign last week. </p>
<p>   According to the letter, ''Published reports indicate that a  number of House Republican leaders had been aware for months that  former Representative Mark Foley (R-FL) had engaged in improper  communications with a House page.'' </p>
<p>   The letter states, ''An investigation by an outside counsel is  required in order to make a publicly credible determination about  what House Republican leaders did, or did not do, once they  learned about former Representative Foley's improper  communications with a House page, and whether their actions, or  failures to act, represented improper conduct by the House  Members involved.'' </p>
<p>   The letter adds, ''Furthermore, the case again demonstrates  why it is essential to establish an independent Office of Public  Integrity (OPI) in Congress. The House failure to create an  effective and publicly credible ethics enforcement process in  this Congress, in the face of the worst House scandals in  decades, is a national disgrace.'' </p>
<p>   According to the letter, ''An OPI would have allowed an  independent, nonpartisan and professional office to work with the  House Ethics Committee in the Foley matter, and would have  provided public credibility for such an investigation and its  results.'' </p>
<p>   The letter continues, ''Legislative proposals to create an OPI  were introduced in this Congress by Representatives Christopher  Shays (R-CT) and Marty Meehan (D-MA), and by Senators Susan  Collins (R-ME) and Joe Lieberman (D-CT).'' </p>
<p>   The letter states, ''In the House, the OPI proposal was  disgracefully blocked by the House Republican leaders, including  House Rules Committee Chairman David Dreier (R-CA), from even  being considered for a vote on the House floor during  consideration of lobbying and ethics legislation.'' </p>
<p>   According to the letter, ''The establishment of an Office of  Public Integrity in Congress, as proposed in the Shays-Meehan  legislation (H.R. 4799), would effectively address the overriding  ethics failure in the House today, the absence of a real and  publicly credible system for conducting ethics investigations and  enforcing the congressional ethics rules.'' </p>
<p>   The letter adds, ''An investigation by an outside counsel must  determine what steps, if any, these House leaders took to  investigate whether Representative Foley had engaged in improper  communications with the House page involved, and with other House  pages, which, according to published reports he, in fact, had  done.'' </p>
<p>   The letter says, ''An independent investigation by an outside  counsel must determine whether any improper efforts were made to  conceal this matter, and why this matter apparently was not  brought to the attention of all Members who serve on the House  Page Board or to the attention of the Members of the House Ethics  Committee.'' </p>
<p>   According to the letter, ''For example, according to published  reports, two of the three Representatives who sit on the House  Page Board, Representatives Dale Kildee (D-MI) and Shelley Moore  Capito (R-WV), have said they were never informed about the  emails that were brought to the attention of Representative  Shimkus, Chairman of the House Page Board, and other House  Republican leaders.'' </p>
<p>   The letter continues, ''An independent investigation by an  outside counsel must determine whether the House Republican  leaders, who knew about the problem with Representative Foley  months ago, failed to protect the interests and rights of House  pages and failed to protect the institutional integrity of the  House.'' </p>
<p>   The letter states, ''In short, an independent investigation by  an outside counsel is required to determine whether the House  Republican leaders who had knowledge of Representative Foley's  improper communications with a House page dealt with this matter  in a way that fails to 'reflect creditably' on the House, in  violation of House ethics Rule 23.'' </p>
<p>   The letter adds, ''Since this matter involves the Speaker of  the House and other high-ranking Republican leaders, it is  essential that an outside counsel be retained by the House Ethics  Committee in order for there to be a publicly credible  investigation of the matter.'' </p>
<p>   According to the letter, ''Democracy 21 calls on the House  Ethics Committee to expeditiously appoint an outside counsel to  conduct a full investigation of the Foley scandal and the way in  which it was handled by House Republican leaders.'' </p>
<p>   The letter concludes, ''We also call on the House to act  expeditiously to address the most dangerous and damaging problem  with the House ethics process by establishing an Office of Public  Integrity in Congress, as set forth in the Shays-Meehan bill.'' </p>
