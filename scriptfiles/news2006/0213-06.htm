<p>WASHINGTON - February 13 - In a new  report released today, international agency Oxfam urges rich  countries to step up to the mark and respond generously to the  massive humanitarian crisis and lack of security in the eastern  Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) when they meet in Brussels  today (Monday, Feb. 13). </p>
<p>   While donors are rightly investing over $450 million in  support of the electoral process planned for April 29, 2006,  Oxfam is calling on donors not to ignore the humanitarian appeal  for $682 million to provide urgently needed aid for 42 million  people. </p>
<p>   &quot;The donor conference must set the tone for the future of the  DRC,&quot; said Oxfam's DRC Country Program Manager Gordon Kihuguru.  &quot;The democratic process is vital in the long-term but providing  millions of people with enough food and water to survive each day  and working to bring peace has to be the immediate priority as  dead people cannot vote. </p>
<p>   &quot;Donor governments must rise to the challenge of meeting real  needs across the country at a critical point of both humanitarian  crisis and democratic transition.&quot; </p>
<p>   No humanitarian appeal for DRC in the last five years has been  more than three quarters funded at best with last year's appeal  raising just $136 million or 62 percent of what Congo required.  By contrast, $1.1 billion was pledged to the Tsunami appeal  meeting 85 percent of the stated requirements. </p>
<p>   Oxfam's report shows that this year's appeal is three times  bigger than last year based on a much more accurate reflection of  need. Countries such as the US, Japan, Germany, France and Italy  need to significantly increase their 2005 contributions to the  DRC.  Oxfam is calling on smaller donors such as Australia and  Spain, who gave well below their fair share in 2005 to increase  their contributions by a similar magnitude to take on the burden  of one of the greatest tasks facing the humanitarian community  today. If donors were to give the humanitarian action plan appeal  according to their national income they would be making vastly  increased contributions as illustrated in the table below. </p>
<p>   Some countries make important aid contributions bilaterally  and via the EU, meeting vital needs. However, these are not a  substitute for contributions to the UN Humanitarian Action Plan,  especially with its threefold budget increase. The scale of need  is too great. </p>

<p>    ------ </p>
<p>   Currently one thousand people in the DRC die every day as a  result of the conflict which has claimed the lives of 3.9 million  people since 1998. The country lacks basic infrastructure and  most services have collapsed including the health system that is  unable to cope with the level of disease. The conflict has  created widespread food shortages and pockets of acute  malnutrition. </p>
<p>   The human cost of the conflict in the DRC continues into 2006  despite the hopes for peace offered by the 2003 Global and  All-Inclusive Accord. Even though a government was formed in  2003, the underlying causes of the war have not been adequately  addressed. </p>
<p>   &quot;In the rush to support democratic elections donor governments  must not forget the thousands of deaths weekly caused by the  horrific conflict raging in the east of the country,&quot; said  Oxfam's Kihuguru. &quot;People will continue to pay with their lives  until donor governments come up with vital funds for food, water  and healthcare to reach the millions in need.&quot; </p>
<p>   Oxfam has been working in the DRC since the 1960s providing  emergency assistance including water, sanitation and public  health to 300,000 in the eastern DRC. Countrywide Oxfam is  working on education and livelihoods programmes. </p>
