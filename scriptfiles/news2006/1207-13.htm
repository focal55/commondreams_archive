<p>SAN FRANCISCO –  December 7 - After months of delays and refusals by U.S. officials, the National Lawyers Guild’s Military Law Task Force (“MLTF”) and Co-chair Marguerite Hiken recently filed a motion asking a federal court here to compel disclosure of documentation concerning the U.S. military’s attack on the Iraqi city of Fallujah and assault on a car carrying Italian journalist Giuliana Sgrena. The plaintiffs request the documents to clarify whether the U.S. military was acting lawfully during these two incidents.

 

<p>The motion for summary judgment, filed December 1, 2006, in the U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, followed denials by the Department of Defense and U.S. Central Command of the MLTF’s Freedom of Information Act request for Rules of Engagement (“ROE”) and other documentation.

 

<p>This case proceeds at a time when the Department of Justice promises to support any plausible refusal of a FOIA request. The government claims that the requested documents are exempt from disclosure because they are properly classified. However, over-classification of documents is so rampant that as few as 10 percent of classifications are legitimate, according to Rodney McDaniel, President Reagan’s executive secretary at the National Security Council and career Navy officer.

 

<p>Ms. Hiken plans to write an article for On Watch, a newsletter published by the MLTF, regarding the U.S.-led assault on Fallujah and the shooting by U.S. soldiers that riddled the Toyota Corolla carrying Ms. Sgrena with 11 bullet holes, wounding her and her driver and killing intelligence agent Nicola Calipari, whose last act was to throw his body over Ms. Sgrena’s to protect her from the gunfire.

 

<p>The Sgrena incident has given rise to allegations of wrongdoing by the U.S. soldiers who fired on the car and their superiors and has strained relations between the United States and Italy. It has also prompted critique of the ROE under which the soldiers were acting and inquiry into how the military distinguishes between civilians and combatants on the roads in Iraq. The US Military cleared the soldiers involved in the Sgrena shooting of any wrongdoing, stating that they were acting within the ROE.

 

<p>Release of the ROE, in addition to casting light on whether the soldiers who fired on Ms. Sgrena were acting lawfully, is important so that the American people may better understand its military’s legal justification for the destruction of Fallujah, a city similar in size to Oakland and Long Beach, and the slaughter of its inhabitants. The ROE also should be released to clear up ambiguities generated by the widely differing accounts of the ROE.

 

<p>For example, according to one report, the ROE the soldiers were given for the siege were “draconian;” the commanders in Fallujah did not authorize the use of non-lethal munitions. Instead, the ROE given to the soldiers focused on protecting U.S. military forces with shoot-to- kill orders. On the other hand, some have alleged that the ROE tied the soldiers’ hands, placing them in greater peril. “A Marine officer caught up in the bloody fight to clear Fallujah was [harsh] in his assessment: ‘Blood,’ he observed, ‘is on someone’s hands.’”

 

<p>It is the plaintiffs’ position that the U.S. government is hiding violations of international law and is too embarrassed to release the documentation. As stated by former U.S. Solicitor Erwin Griswold when considering whether materials were properly classified, “the principle concern of the classifiers is not with national security, but with governmental embarrassment of one sort of another.” This power to classify is not a blank check for the government to classify documents. For example, materials are in no case to be classified to conceal violations of law, prevent embarrassment to a person, organization or agency, or prevent or delay the release of information that does not require protection in the interest of national security.

 

<p>The government will respond to the MLTF’s pleading on December 29, and the plaintiffs will file a final pleading on January 26. Hearing is set on the matter for February 12, 2007, in San Francisco.
