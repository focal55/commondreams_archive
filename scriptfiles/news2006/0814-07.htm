<p>WASHINGTON - August 14 - With mid-term elections around the corner and as new Census numbers prepare to show that the scope of the health care crisis continues to reach record proportions, Health Care Voters are going to Chalk It Up! on Tuesday, August 22 to dramatize they will no longer chalk up the health care crisis to Congress&#8217; misplaced priorities and inaction and are ready to hold candidates and elected officials accountable.&#160;
<p><strong>WHAT:&#160;Rallies, Actions and Events to call for a New American Health Care System</strong></p>

<p><strong>WHEN:&#160;Tuesday, August 22</strong></p>

<p><strong>WHERE:&#160; &#160;26 States and 34 Cities Across the Country (as of 8/11)<br />
For a full list, go to</strong> <a href="http://www.imahealthcarevoter.org/"><strong>www.ImAHealthCareVoter.org</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>

<p><strong>VISUALS:</strong>&#160;Participants will draw chalk outlines on public and private property to call attention to the millions of Americans who are uninsured and underinsured.&#160; In Baltimore, MD, hundreds of Health Care Voters will Chalk It Up! at the Inner Harbor with speakers Mayor Martin O&#8217;Malley and SEIU Secretary-Treasurer Anna Burger.&#160; In Portland, OR, kids, who are often most affected by the health care crisis, will join in the debate and Chalk It Up! at City Hall.</p>

<p>Updated Census Bureau statistics on our country&#8217;s uninsured are scheduled to be released on August 29. Currently nearly 46 million Americans lack insurance, but the census is unable to quantify the millions more Americans who are underinsured and may be one major illness away from bankruptcy or worse.</p>

<p>Americans want real solutions and a new American health care system now. At least 18,000 people die each year because they lack health insurance. Chalk It Up! will highlight the pressing need for real, comprehensive health care reform.&#160; There may not be a chalk outline at a crime scene for each person affected by the health care crisis but it&#8217;s just as criminal to ignore it through inaction.</p>
