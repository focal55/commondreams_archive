<p>NEW YORK - August 9 - The United Nations should immediately 
launch an international investigation into civilian deaths in Lebanon and 
northern Israel, Human Rights Watch said today. In a letter to the U.N. 
Security Council today, Secretary-General Kofi Annan concluded that the 
effects of the conflict on civilians in Lebanon and Israel require a 
comprehensive investigation.

<p>"Kofi Annan rightly recognizes the need to investigate the impact of this 
conflict on civilians, but that investigation won't start by itself," said 
Kenneth Roth, executive director of Human Rights Watch. "The U.N. 
should waste no time in sending experts to look at the terrible toll of 
civilian deaths in Lebanon and northern Israel."   
  
<p>In several reports in the last four weeks, Human Rights Watch has 
documented indiscriminate use of force against civilians by both the Israel 
Defense Forces and Hezbollah. Human Rights Watch researchers, 
investigating more than 20 attacks that killed more than 150 civilians in 
Lebanon, described a systematic failure by the Israeli forces to distinguish 
between combatants and civilians that may constitute war crimes. Human 
Rights Watch also accused Hezbollah of committing war crimes by 
deliberately and indiscriminately killing civilians by firing rockets that 
cannot be aimed at military targets into populated areas and killing more 
than 30 civilians in northern Israel.   
  
<p>On July 30 the Security Council asked the secretary-general to report on 
the circumstances of that day's Israeli attack on the village of Qana. Based 
on the information he gathered, the secretary-general found that the deaths 
in Qana should be seen in the broader context of a possible pattern of 
violations of international law, including international humanitarian and 
human rights law, committed by both sides during this conflict.   
  
<p>"It's no use looking at one incident or one side in isolation," Roth said. "A 
full and fair investigation would press both parties to do more to protect 
civilians."   
  
<p>Human Rights Watch has called for Secretary-General Annan to appoint 
an International Commission of Inquiry (COI) to investigate reports of 
violations of international humanitarian law, including possible war 
crimes, in Lebanon and Israel, and to make recommendations aimed at 
holding accountable those who violated the law. The COI should be 
headed by a widely-respected and impartial expert with direct experience 
investigating wartime compliance with the laws of war, and should be 
adequately funded and staffed with a team having expertise in forensics, 
ballistics and weaponry, and international humanitarian law.
