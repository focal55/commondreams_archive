<p>MINNEAPOLIS, Minnesota  - June 8 - Minnesota Governor Tim Pawlenty has signed into law H.F. 3718, the nation&rsquo;s first law promoting plug-in hybrid, flexible-fueled vehicles.
<p>The legislation &#150; inspired by the Institute for Local Self-Reliance's report <i>A Better Way</i> that proposed an electricity-alcohol transportation energy strategy, and several articles by ILSR staff published in the <i>Minneapolis</i> <i>Star Tribune</i> in late 2005 &#150; sailed through both houses by a unanimous vote.</p>
								<p>&ldquo;Both conservative Republicans and liberal Democrats understand that this is the only near term strategy available that can cure us of our oil addiction,&rdquo; notes David Morris, ILSR&rsquo;s Vice President, who testified as an expert witness before six legislative committees.</p>
								<p>The law instructs the state to buy plug-in hybrids on a preferred basis when they become available.&nbsp; It also encourages Minnesota State University-Mankato to develop flex-fuel plug-in hybrid vehicles, and creates a task force consisting of business, government and utility representatives to develop a strategy for using, and producing such vehicles in Minnesota.</p>
								<p>A plug-in hybrid can run primarily on electricity, which inherently reduces oil consumption.&nbsp; &ldquo;Only three percent of our electricity is generated from oil,&rdquo; Morris observes, &ldquo;And many states are requiring an increasing percentage of renewable electricity.&rdquo;&nbsp; Renewable fuels like ethanol would provide the primary energy source for the vehicle&rsquo;s engine.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
								<p>&ldquo;Minnesota has the resources necessary to make flexible fuel plug-in hybrid production a reality,&quot; says Frank Hornstein, the bill's chief House author. &quot;We have the research at Minnesota State-Mankato. We have the corn and ethanol industry.&nbsp; We have a growing number of wind farms. And we have the Ford plant.&quot;</p>
								<p>&quot;Ford has said it will close the plant.&nbsp; The task force can help us develop new opportunities,&quot; notes Scott Dibble, the bill's chief Senate author.&nbsp; &quot;We could have a technology developed in Minnesota and built at the Ford Plant, which already runs on renewable energy generated at the plant's hydroelectric dam on the Mississippi river.&quot;</p>
