<p>TALLAHASSEE, Florida - February 8 - An anti-gay proposed Constitutional amendment that failed to 
gather enough signatures to be placed on the 2006 ballot should be thrown out 
altogether because it deceives voters, the American Civil Liberties Union argued 
before the Florida Supreme Court today.</P>
<P>The measure, which anti-gay groups have vowed to place on the 2008 
Presidential ballot, would ban equal marriage rights, permanently block civil 
unions and threaten existing domestic partnership protections across the 
state.</P>
<P>&#8220;The majority of Floridians are in favor of providing legal protections for 
lesbian and gay couples,&#8221; said Leslie Cooper, a senior staff attorney for the 
ACLU who appeared before Florida&#8217;s high court.&nbsp; &#8220;Yet the proposed 
initiative was drafted to deceive the voters into believing they are voting just 
about marriage when in fact the proposed amendment could be used to attack the 
very protections for lesbian and gay couples that most Floridians support.&#8221;</P>
<P>Working with Equality Florida and the Fairness for all Families campaign, the 
ACLU and the National Center for Lesbian Rights brought the legal challenge to 
the proposed initiative on behalf of the American Federation of State, County 
and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) and six same-sex couples from across 
Florida.&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>Jon Durre and Robert Sullivan, who have been together for 11 years, had hoped 
to be in court to hear today&#8217;s arguments, but Durre is fighting advanced 
prostate cancer and was too ill to travel from their home in Pensacola.&nbsp; 
</P>
<P>"Through my battle with cancer, we've come to know all too well the hardships 
of not having a legally recognized relationship," said Durre.&nbsp; "I'm unable 
to work, and my partner's employer doesn't provide domestic partner health 
insurance.&nbsp; Almost all of the money I receive from disability goes to 
health care costs.&nbsp; We went from being financially stable to struggling to 
make ends meet.&nbsp; On top of the financial challenges, we recognize that 
legally, Robert has no rights where I'm concerned -- whether it's hospital 
visitation or being kept out of decisions about my care or funeral arrangements 
after I die."</P>
<P>In court today, Cooper argued that the initiative violates the single-subject 
rule of the Florida constitution because it includes both a ban on marriage and 
a ban on other legal protections for same-sex couples.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Polls from the St. Petersburg Times/Miami Herald and the Tampa 
Tribune/WFLA-TV indicate that the majority of Floridians are opposed to marriage 
for same-sex couples, yet the majority favors civil unions or other legal 
protection for same-sex couples.&nbsp; Allowing the proposed initiative to go 
forward would put voters in the unfair position of having to make a choice about 
two separate issues on which many voters feel differently.&nbsp; </P>
<P>The Liberty Counsel, which drafted the initiative, has tried to claim it only 
bans same-sex couples from marriage and &#8220;unions&#8221; that are the "substantial 
equivalent of marriage,&#8221; and not other legal recognition for lesbian and gay 
couples.&nbsp; However, this very group has already tried to strip same-sex 
couples of domestic partner protections afforded by the City of Gainesville by 
claiming that the protections are illegal under Florida law because they are the 
substantial &#8220;equivalent&#8221; of marriage.&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>Richard Nolan and Bob Pingpank, who just celebrated their 50th anniversary 
together, are especially concerned about how this initiative would affect the 
domestic partner protections they are afforded by West Palm Beach.&nbsp; Nolan, 
a retired Episcopal priest, and Pingpank, a retired math teacher, are facing the 
same concerns that all seniors must face.&nbsp; Nolan has already been 
hospitalized several times &#8211; for a heart attack and a severe gall stone 
attack.</P>
<P>&#8220;When West Palm passed its domestic partner law, we thought we would no 
longer have to worry about visiting each other in the hospital or making 
emergency medical decisions for each other,&#8221; said Nolan.&nbsp; &#8220;But if this 
initiative is allowed to go forward, we have to face those worries all over 
again.&nbsp; It&#8217;s inconceivable to me that there are people in our state who 
want to amend our constitution to ignore the 50-year commitment we have to each 
other and treat us like legal strangers.&#8221;&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>Although the proponents of the initiative failed to get the required number 
of signatures to put the initiative on the ballot this November, they have said 
that they will continue collecting signatures in order to put the initiative on 
the ballot in 2008 if it is not struck down. The FairnessforAllFamilies.org 
campaign led by Equality Florida is organizing across the state to counter the 
message of discrimination. </P>
<P>&#8220;When fair-minded Floridians come to understand just how harmful this 
initiative is to so many Florida families, they will reject this amendment,&#8221; 
said Nadine Smith, chair of the FairnessforAllFamilies.org campaign. &#8220;Laws 
should not make it harder to take care of the people you love.&#8221;</P>
<P>Karen Doering, Senior Counsel for the National Center for Lesbian Rights 
added, &#8220;As the couples involved in this challenge demonstrate so clearly, real 
people face very real harms when lesbian and gay couples are treated as legal 
strangers.&nbsp; Florida voters deserve better than to be hoodwinked by a group 
of anti-gay activists into voting to amend the Florida Constitution in a way 
that will make families suffer.&#8221;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <BR>&nbsp;<BR>A copy of the 
brief as well as additional biographical information on the couples involved is
