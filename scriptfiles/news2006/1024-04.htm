<p>WASHINGTON - October 24 - A nonpartisan "election protection" coalition, led by the People For the American Way Foundation, the NAACP, and the Lawyers' Committee For Civil Rights Under Law, has announced that it is launching a national 1-866-OUR-VOTE voter-assistance hotline and the poll-location web site MyPollingPlace.com. The hotline is staffed by live call-center operators trained to provide state-specific assistance to all voters.

<p><strong>BARBARA R. ARNWINE</strong>
<p>Arnwine is the executive director of the Lawyers' Committee For Civil Rights Under Law. Alton is the public policy director for the organization. Arnwine said today: "This election poses significant challenges for voters more than any time in recent history, with an estimated 30 million voters using new machines for the first time. The 1-866-OUR-VOTE hotline serves as a lifeline to voters and is available now to help navigate new requirements as well as answer questions about voter eligibility or [the] location of the polling place."

</strong>
<p>The League of Women Voters has produced "5 Things You Need to Know on Election Day cards" -- in English and Spanish -- and is distributing them nationwide through more than 850 state and local Leagues. The League is also launching today <a href="http://www.vote411.org" target="_new">VOTE411.org</a>, a nonpartisan national Web site that provides essential information for voters.

<p>Wilson is the national League president. She said today: "Voters need to know there are simple steps they can take to protect their votes on November 7. Important changes in our voting systems have been implemented over the last few years. All voters need to be aware of what they are and what to expect on Election Day. The '5 Things card' is a handy reference -- a last-minute checklist -- to help voters prepare to participate in this election. ... This checklist includes such things as: go to the right place; bring I.D.; get a ballot; get help; and stay and vote.&quot; <a href="http://www.lwv.org/AM/Template.cfm?Section=Home" target="_new">More information</a>.
