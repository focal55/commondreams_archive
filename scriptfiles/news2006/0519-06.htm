<p>WASHINGTON - May 19 - Human Rights Campaign President Joe Solmonese made the following statement regarding Vermont Gov. James Douglas’s veto of a bill prohibiting discrimination based on gender identity or expression. The bill, approved by the Vermont Legislature, would have made the state the ninth in the nation to prohibit anti-transgender discrimination.

<p>“Employees should be judged by the job they do, not by someone else’s prejudice,” said Solmonese. “Governor Douglas’s veto puts Vermont law far behind public opinion, which is overwhelmingly in favor of these protections, and corporate America, which is leading the way in ensuring that transgender employees are protected from discrimination on the job. When it comes to public accommodations and housing, cities and states across the nation are moving forward in these protections. We will continue stand by the side of state leaders in working to secure the passage of this important law.”
