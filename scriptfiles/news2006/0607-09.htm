WASHINGTON - June 7 - <p align="center"><i>President Bush and the Republican leadership 
gambled their dwindling political capital on a discriminatory amendment 
and came up empty,&#8217; said Human Rights Campaign President Joe 
Solmonese.</b> &#8216;With the addition of Senators Specter and 
Gregg, not only did every senator who voted against discrimination in 
2004 stand with us today but momentum is on the side of 
equality.&#8217;
</i></p>
<p>
The Senate voted 49 to 48 today to 
defeat the Federal Marriage Amendment, a measure that would have denied 
marriage to same-sex couples and seriously threatened civil unions and 
domestic partnerships. Seven Republicans joined 41 Democrats in voting 
down the measure, which opponents said was a politically motivated 
distraction from real challenges facing the country.</p>

<p>&#8220;President Bush and the Republican leadership gambled their 
dwindling political capital on a discriminatory amendment and came up 
empty,&#8221; said Human Rights Campaign President Joe Solmonese. 
&#8220;With the addition of Senators Specter and Gregg, not only did 
every senator who voted against discrimination in 2004 stand with us 
today but momentum is on the side of equality. This is a resounding 
defeat against discrimination."</p>

<p>Solmonese continued, &#8220;For the House to now take up a bill 
that&#8217;s dead and twice failed would prove beyond a shadow of a 
doubt this is nothing more than election-year posturing.</p>

<p>&#8220;The quarter of a million postcards we delivered on behalf of 
Human Rights Campaign members made the strength of opposition known on 
Capitol Hill,&#8221; added Solmonese. &#8220;Many thanks to these 
members for speaking out, to our allies for working side-by-side with us 
in defeating this measure and, especially, to the senators who saw 
through this thinly veiled attempt to divide the American people with 
discrimination.&#8221;</p>

<p>Two senators, Sens. Specter and Gregg, changed their 2004 
votes&#160;&#8212; both voting against cloture. Republican 
Sens.&#160;Sununu, Chafee, Snowe, McCain, Collins, Specter and Gregg all 
voted against the measure. The procedural vote, known as cloture, needed 
60 votes to pass and received 49 votes today. By defeating cloture, the 
vote killed the amendment. Had it passed cloture, the amendment would 
have needed 67 votes to pass the Senate.</p>

<p>In 2004, the Senate and House both fell far short of the two-thirds 
vote necessary to send the amendment to the states for ratification. In 
the Senate, the vote against cloture was 50 to 48, with six Republicans 
voting no. The Republicans who opposed cloture were Sens. Campbell, 
Chafee, Collins, McCain, Snowe and Sununu. In the House, the vote was 
227 to 186.</p>

<p>Many prominent Republicans and conservatives expressed opposition to 
the amendment in 2004, including Vice President Cheney, Arlen Specter, 
Rudy Guiliani, Chuck Hagel, David Dreier, George Pataki, Bob Barr, Alan 
Simpson, George Will and David Brooks. This year, those numbers 
increased to former Sen. Danforth who called the amendment 
&#8220;silly&#8221; and &#8220;contrary to basic Republican 
principles.&#8221; Also, First Lady Laura Bush was recently quoted as 
saying, &#8220;I don&#8217;t think it should be used as a campaign tool, 
obviously.&#8221;</p>

<p>After it was announced that Sen. McCain would deliver the 
commencement address at Jerry Falwell&#8217;s Liberty University, the 
many media stories prompted McCain to reaffirm his opposition to the 
amendment several times.</p>

<p>In response to a letter sent by Bill Frist in late April outlining 
the Federal Marriage Amendment as a key vote, Senate Minority Leader 
Harry Reid said, &#8220;We owe it to the American people to focus on 
their needs, and not waste a single day focusing on partisan needs. That 
means setting aside an issue like the marriage amendment, and tackling 
the issue of gas prices instead.&#8221;</p>

<p>A long list of African-American leaders has spoken out against the 
amendment. The late Coretta Scott King told college students once that 
&#8220;a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriages is a form 
of gay-bashing. &#8230; Instead of trivializing the Constitution, we 
need some laws that give families the kind of help they really need, 
like job training and child care assistance, stronger schools and health 
insurance coverage for every family.&#8221;</p>

<p>Julian Bond, Rep. John Lewis, the Rev. Andrew Young, Ambassador Carol 
Moseley Braun, Leonard Pitts, the&#160;Rev. Peter Gomes and Dr. Henry 
Louis Gates have all been public in their strong opposition to the 
amendment. The NAACP also opposes the Federal Marriage Amendment and 
testified against the amendment in 2004.</p>

<p><i>The Human Rights Campaign is the largest national lesbian, gay, 
bisexual and transgender political organization with members throughout 
the country. It effectively lobbies Congress, provides campaign support 
and educates the public to ensure that LGBT Americans can be open, 
honest and safe at home, at work and in the community.</i></p> </p>
