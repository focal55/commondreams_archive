<p>WASHINGTON - April 7 - Congressman Dennis J. Kucinich (D-OH), Ranking Democrat on the House Government Reform Subcommittee on National Security, Emerging Threats and International Relations, announced today that he will introduce a Resolution of Inquiry to demand documents from the White House on the role that the President played in the leaking of the National Intelligence Estimate (NIE).

<p>A Resolution of Inquiry is a privileged resolution used to obtain documents from the Executive Branch. Under House rules, Kucinich's resolution will be referred to committee, and action must be taken in committee within 14 legislative days.

<p>Kucinich's resolution will seek documents, including telephone logs, email records, calendars, minutes and memos, regarding the role the President played in declassifying selected portions of the NIE and the leaking of the NIE to the press. 

<p>Kucinich released the following statement today on his resolution: 

<p>"This leak was not done in the national interest, but rather the political interest of the President and his Administration. Congress must investigate this gross abuse of power.

<p>"With this latest revelation, the President's already sizeable credibility gap on Iraq has grown to a credibility abyss. 

<p>"The American public, and the Congress, have right to know the truth. My resolution seeks to compel Congress to perform its basic Constitutional duty, and provide oversight of an Administration, which quite clearly, operates without concern for the truth."
