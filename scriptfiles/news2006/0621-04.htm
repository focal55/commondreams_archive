<p>NEW YORK - June 21 - The American Civil Liberties Union and the New York Civil Liberties Union 
today joined V-Day in hosting Any One of Us: Words from Prison, an evening of 
performance telling the stories of incarcerated women and the role of violence 
in their lives. <BR>
&nbsp;<BR>"In New York State the Rockefeller Drug Laws 
subject thousands of women every year to the violence of the prison system - 
simply because they've committed low-level drug offenses," said Donna Lieberman, 
Executive Director of the NYCLU. "Words from Prison will bring forth the voices 
of the women who are suffering under this ongoing travesty of 
justice."<BR>&nbsp;<BR>The event is part of the ongoing festival Until the 
Violence Stops: NYC, presented by V-Day, the global movement founded by 
playwright Eve Ensler, which aims to raise funds and awareness to combat 
violence against women and girls.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>Any One of Us: Words from Prison 
is directed by Rhodessa Jones and will feature readings by Rosario Dawson, Rosie 
O'Donnell, Phylicia Rashad, Kimberle Crenshaw, Michael Eric Dyson, and formerly 
incarcerated women Kemba Smith, Betty Gale Tyson and Angela Wilson. Through 
readings and song, the performers will highlight the connections between 
violence against women and incarceration.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>"Women in prison 
experience violence before, during and after incarceration," said Lenora 
Lapidus, Director of the ACLU Women's Rights Project. "They are subjected to 
domestic violence, abuse by prison guards, separation from their families and 
denial of government benefits, including welfare, public housing and educational 
loans."<BR>&nbsp;<BR>The event will take place at Alice Tully Hall in Lincoln 
Center Plaza, New York City this evening at 8 p.m. and will benefit the ACLU and 
the NYCLU.<BR><BR>More information is available online at <A class=noline_blue href="http://www.aclu.org/wordsfromprison">www.aclu.org/wordsfromprison</A><!-- #EndEditable -->
