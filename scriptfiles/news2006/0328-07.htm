<p>WASHINGTON - March 28 - New York City Mayor  Michael Bloomberg today once again stood up for common sense gun  laws, appearing at a Congressional hearing to harshly criticize  legislation that would make it harder for police to combat gun  trafficking.</p>
<p>   He earned the praise of Jim and Sarah Brady.  This week marks  the 25th anniversary of Brady's shooting in the assassination  attempt on President Reagan.  </p>
<p>   &quot;Too many Americans continue to have their families torn apart  by gun violence, and we all owe Mayor Bloomberg a great deal of  praise,&quot; Jim Brady said.  &quot;A lot of public officials talk about  standing up to the special interests - Mayor Bloomberg is really  doing it.&quot;</p>
<p>   &quot;We're extremely grateful to have the Mayor fighting to make  sure our law enforcement officers have the tools they need to get  crime guns off the streets,&quot; said Sarah Brady.  &quot;Efforts in  Congress to coddle the gun lobby must stop.&quot;</p>
<p>   Mayor Bloomberg's testimony came at a hearing of the House  Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, and Homeland Security  on a bill, H.R. 5005, that would weaken federal gun laws by  blocking ATF from disclosing to the public crime gun trace data  and thus shielding from public and law enforcement scrutiny the  identities of the gun dealers with the worst records of supplying  the illegal market.  The bill would further weaken federal gun  laws by eliminating the current requirement that gun dealers  report multiple handgun sales to law enforcement officials,  limiting the ability of ATF to search dealer sales records in  criminal investigations, and creating a loophole in the federal  ban on importation of non-sporting firearms.</p>
<p>   Jim Brady was partially paralyzed in the assassination attempt  on President Reagan on March 30, 1981.  To mark the anniversary,  the Brady Campaign on Thursday will announce plans for a  comprehensive strategy to combat gun trafficking.  </p>
<p>   As the nation's largest, non-partisan, grassroots organization  leading the fight to prevent gun violence, the Brady Campaign,  working with its dedicated network of Million Mom March Chapters,  is devoted to creating an America free from gun violence, where  all Americans are safe at home, at school, at work, and in our  communities.</p>
