<p>WASHINGTON - December 4 - The US government should expand its apology to Brandon Mayfield by admitting its wrongful use of a material witness warrant to detain the Oregon lawyer without charge or opportunity for him to respond to terrorism-related allegations, Human Rights Watch said today.</p>

Human Rights Watch commended Mayfield for having successfully extracted a long-overdue apology from the US government on November 29 for the FBI’s faulty fingerprint identification that led to his wrongful arrest and detention in 2004. The federal government failed, however, to acknowledge that it had improperly used a material witness warrant to secure his detention.
&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>In May 2004, the FBI arrested Mayfield in Portland, Oregon, based on what later turned out to be faulty fingerprint evidence that allegedly linked Mayfield to the Madrid train bombings two months earlier. Even though the flawed fingerprint match indicated that Mayfield was a prime suspect in the bombing, he was arrested instead as a “material witness” and held for more than two weeks in jail. During that time he was never charged with a crime or given any chance to contest the basis for his detention. He was then subjected to another week of house arrest before the FBI realized that their fingerprint evidence was faulty and Mayfield regained his liberty.
&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>The Mayfield case is a prime example of the government’s misuse of the material witness statute to indefinitely detain without charge those it wants to investigate as possible terrorist suspects. <a href="http://hrw.org/reports/2005/us0605/index.htm"> Witness to Abuse Report</a>
&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>Enacted in 1984, the material witness statute was designed to allow the government to secure the testimony of witnesses who might otherwise flee to avoid testifying in a criminal proceeding. If a court agrees that an individual has information “material” to a criminal proceeding and will likely flee if subpoenaed, the witness can be locked up, but only for as long as is necessary to have him testify or be deposed. 
&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>But since the attacks of September 11, 2001, the US Department of Justice has deliberately used the law for a very different purpose: to secure the indefinite incarceration of those, like Mayfield, it believes are connected to a terrorism-related crime.  It has used the law to imprison at least 70 men without any showing of probable cause that they had committed crimes. Courts have been far too quick to accede to the government’s request for such warrants, and their failure to exercise due scrutiny of government claims has made innocent people the hapless victims of the government’s zeal.  
&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>In Mayfield’s case, for example, the court was willing to accept the government’s argument that he was the proper subject of a material witness arrest warrant, even though the apparent fingerprint match would have rendered him a suspect, not a witness.  Even though Mayfield was a practicing attorney and a member of the Oregon bar, lived with his wife and three children (who are US citizens like him), had not traveled out of the country in 10 years, and had no criminal record, the court accepted the government’s position that he was a flight risk and therefore the proper subject of such a warrant.  
&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>The federal government made the incredulous claim that that the fact that Mayfield did not have a valid passport meant that he must be using a fake one. The court appears to have accepted this claim, deciding that it was necessary to arrest and detain Mayfield to prevent him from fleeing the country.
&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>In many ways, Mayfield was one of the lucky ones, however. He was detained for just three weeks total and eventually let go. Of the 70 post-9/11 material witness cases identified by Human Rights Watch, over one-third were incarcerated under material witnesses warrants for at least two months, some more than six months, and at least one individual spent over a year in prison. And 42 were, like Mayfield, neither arrested in order for their testimony to be obtained nor charged with a single offence. 
&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>Senator Patrick Leahy in 2005 introduced legislation (S. 1739) that would amend the material warrant statute to tighten the language of the statute to avoid such abuses in the future, ensuring that it is used solely for the purpose for which it is intended.  The new Congress should support – and pass - this legislation.
