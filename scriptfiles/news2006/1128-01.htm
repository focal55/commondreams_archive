<p>WASHINGTON - November 28 - The following is a fact  sheet from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities consumer  expenditures:</p>
<p>   -- Consumer Expenditures Lag for Low- and Middle-Income  Families</p>
<p>   -- Most Americans Treading Water or Falling Further Behind,  Consumption Data Show: Only High Earners Spending More Than  Before Recession</p>
<p>   Widely reported data on Americans' incomes paint a  disappointing picture of the current economic expansion,  especially for low- and middle-income families.  By most  measures, Americans' real (inflation-adjusted) incomes in 2005  were still below their level in the recession year of 2001.   Less-well-known data on consumer spending -- including newly  released Labor Department data for 2005 -- add an important  element to this story, showing that only high-income households  have been able to raise their living standards in recent years.</p>
<p>   Examination of the Labor Department data by CBPP and EPI shows  that:</p>
<p>   Between 2000 and 2005, consumption grew among high-income  households, remained stagnant among middle-income households, and  declined among low-income households.  Households in all income  categories saw their average before-tax incomes decline between  2000 (the peak of the last business cycle) and 2005 in inflation- adjusted terms.  Still, high-income families were able to  increase their consumption spending by using their generous tax  cuts, prior savings (or reductions in new savings), and  borrowing.  Low-income families, in contrast, were forced to cut  back on expenditures, since they received only tiny tax cuts, had  few savings, and had little recourse to borrowing.</p>
<p>   Disparities in consumption between high-income households and  all other households are widening.  The top fifth of households  made 39 percent of all consumer expenditures in 2005, the highest  share on record.  The bottom fifth of households made just 8  percent of all expenditures in 2005, a tie with 2004 for the  lowest share on record.  As a result, the gap in consumption  between the top and bottom fifths of the population in 2005 was  the largest yet recorded.</p>
<p>   Between 2000 and 2005, the share of total consumer  expenditures made by the top fifth of households went up by a  larger amount than in any other five-year period on record.   Meanwhile, the share of total consumer expenditures made by the  bottom 80 percent of households declined.  By contrast, during  the last economic recovery, from 1991 to 1994, the consumption  shares of the various income groups remained the same.</p>
<p>   Middle-class consumption during the current recovery has been  weak in historical terms.  Some consumer expenditure data show a  decline between 2000 (or 2001) and 2005 in consumer spending by  the middle class, while other data show an increase.  But all of  these data show that during the current recovery, the growth in  consumer spending by the middle class has been substantially  weaker than historical norms - and substantially weaker than  consumption by high-income households.</p>
<p>   Tax cuts have boosted consumption for high earners but have  done virtually nothing for low-income households.  While tax cuts  can enable households to increase their consumption even if their  pre-tax incomes did not increase, the tax cuts enacted since 2001  have given the largest benefits to high-income families.  The top  fifth of families received an average tax cut of $4,845 in 2005,  according to the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy  Center, enough to help them improve their standard of living  despite the lack of improvement in their average pre-tax income.   The bottom fifth of households, in contrast, received an average  tax cut of just $18 in 2005, not enough to have a meaningful  effect on their consumption.</p>
<p>   The consumption statistics cited here do not paint a complete  picture of how the economy is doing for American families.  Total  consumption has been boosted in recent years by a decline in  savings rates, substantial borrowing by households (including  home equity withdrawals), and tax cuts that have been financed by  increased federal borrowing.  The personal savings rate in 2005  was minus 0.4 percent, the first time it has been negative since  the 1930s, as consumers effectively consumed the rise in the  value of some of their assets while also borrowing heavily to  offset such developments as declining real median income for non- elderly households.  Future consumption is likely to be reduced  as a consequence, as debts are repaid and savings return to a  more normal level.</p>
<p>   Similarly, the tax cuts have provided a temporary boost to  consumption but have been financed by substantial federal  borrowing.  When the tax cuts eventually are paid for, as they  ultimately must be (most likely in large part through a  combination of higher taxes and reductions in benefits for  programs such as Social Security and Medicare), the result here,  too, will be lower future consumption.  And to the degree that  Social Security, Medicare or other government spending is  reduced, the adjustments made in the future to cover the costs of  the tax cuts are likely to fall disproportionately on low- and  moderate-income households.</p>
<p>   In sum, the American economy has been spending well beyond its  means, borrowing more than $2 billion a day from abroad, an  amount equivalent to more than 6 percent of the Gross Domestic  Product.  Yet even this level of borrowing has not been enough to  prop up low- and middle-income families' standard of living.</p>
