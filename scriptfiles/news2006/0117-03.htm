<p>WASHINGTON - January 17 - A month from now  millions of Americans will give flowers and chocolate on  Valentine's Day to show their love for moms, dads, kids and  spouses. Yet millions of people don't know about the large  quantities of toxic pesticides used in conventional flowers and  of the horrific conditions children as young as nine experience  while harvesting cacao on plantations used in popular chocolate  confections.  The Organic Consumers Association (OCA), with over  850,000 members in its national network, is urging Americans to  boycott traditional chocolate and flowers this Valentine's Day in  favor of gifts that are organic and Fair Trade.
<p>   To draw attention to the hidden dangers of non-organic and non  Fair Trade chocolate and flowers, OCA is releasing a new Flash  animation February 6, entitled Slammed. Slammed is designed to  reach a mainstream audience of consumers who are heretofore  unaware of these issues. OCA's Flash animation is expected to  reach over one million people via the internet. On February 3  there will be a SNEAK PREVIEW for MEMBERS OF THE MEDIA of Slammed  in advance of its public release on February 6.</p>
<p>   "In the name of greater profits transnational corporations are  cutting corners by polluting the environment as well as  exploiting children and workers to supply the huge demand for  flowers and chocolate on Valentine's Day," says Ronnie Cummins,  National Director and co-founder of the Organic Consumers  Association.  "With 40 percent of the world's chocolate coming  from Côte d'Ivoire where the International Labor Organization  (ILO) and the U.S. Department of State have reported for three  years there is pervasive child slavery, it is simply immoral for  companies such as Nestle, Hershey's, M&M/MARS, Kraft and others  to continue to do business there or through their global  commodity importers such Archer Midland Daniels, Cadbury and  Cargill. Fortunately Americans can choose from a wide variety of  organic and Fair Trade options on February 14, Valentine's Day,  that are competitively priced and ethical."</p>

<p>   Meanwhile organizations such as the International Labor Rights  Fund and the Pesticide Action Network have found that commercial  flowers, produced in countries such as Colombia, are the most  toxic and heavily sprayed agricultural crops on Earth and that  workers in the flower industry, often young women, are forced to  work 18 hour days for poverty wages during peak flower buying  times such as Valentine's Day.</p>
<p>   Millions of Americans will receive emails and letters over the  next month providing them with a list of retailers and  distributors of Fair Trade and organic chocolate and flowers.   The list can also be found online at  <a href="http://releases.usnewswire.com/redir.asp?ReleaseID=59325&Link=http://www.organicconusmers.org">http://www.organicconusmers.org</a>.</p>
<p>   "OCA doesn't want to be a "Debbie Downer" but most Americans  have no idea what goes into these Valentine's Day gifts. It's up  to the media to give people the facts they need to make informed  decisions in order pressure the transnational companies that are  part of this global network of environmental pollution, labor  exploitation, and child slavery," said Cummins.</p>
