<p>WASHINGTON - March 2 - The Nuclear Age Peace Foundation expresses serious concern about the deal reached by US President George W. Bush and Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on March 2, 2006, allowing the resumption of full civilian nuclear cooperation between the two countries.  While strengthened ties between the US and India through expanded cooperation in trade and human development, scientific and medical research, energy technology, and humanitarian relief are welcome and would benefit both countries, cooperation on nuclear technology will undermine America’s security. 

 

<p>If the deal is approved by Congress and the 45-nation Nuclear Suppliers Group, it could severely damage the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and the nonproliferation regime. India has refused to sign the NPT and refuses to accept full-scope International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) safeguards over all of its nuclear facilities. Under the deal reached, only 14 of India’s 22 nuclear reactors will be subject to international safeguards and inspections. India has detonated a nuclear explosive device as recently as 1998. It is reportedly continuing to produce fissile materials for its growing nuclear arsenal. All of this means that India does not qualify for full civil nuclear cooperation under existing US laws. Weakening existing US nonproliferation laws in order to facilitate the US-Indian nuclear deal will have negative security impacts for America and undermine global nonproliferation efforts.  

 

<p>The deal will also free up India’s existing capacity to produce highly enriched uranium and plutonium for weapons. According to Indian nuclear hawk K. Subrahmanhyan, in order to expand India’s nuclear arsenal, it should “categorize as many reactors as possible as civilian” to facilitate foreign refueling and conserve India’s scarce “native uranium fuel for weapons-grade plutonium production.” Under the deal, India is designating its fast breeder reactors, which can produce large quantities of plutonium, as military facilities that will be outside of international safeguards. Currently, India has the capacity to produce six to ten nuclear weapons per year. If Congress implements the deal reached, India will have the capacity to produce some 50 nuclear weapons per year. 

 

<p>For years, other countries have resisted developing nuclear weapons in return for access to peaceful nuclear technology under strict and verifiable control.  If India is allowed to both have nuclear weapons and access to this technology, with few controls, convincing other countries to stay within the NPT will become increasingly difficult. Furthermore, as the US criticizes Iran (an NPT member) for developing its nuclear technology, the US is simultaneously creating a double standard by offering India (a non-NPT member) very similar nuclear technology. 

 

<p>“Carving out an exception in the nonproliferation rules for India will undoubtedly undermine efforts to stop the spread of nuclear weapons,” says Carah Ong, Washington DC Office Director of the Nuclear Age Peace Foundation. “It’s difficult to preach temperance from a barstool; the US will have a hard time convincing other nations to forego nuclear technology and weapons if it changes the rules for one country.”

 

<p>The Nuclear Age Peace Foundation is a non-profit, non-partisan international organization with consultative status to the United Nations.  For more than 20 years, the Foundation has been committed to advancing initiatives to eliminate the nuclear weapons threat to all life, to fostering the global rule of law, and to building an enduring legacy of peace through education and advocacy. The Foundation’s headquarters are in Santa Barbara, CA and it has an office in Washington, DC.
