<p>WASHINGTON - APRIL 25 - Following is a  statement by John Stanton, vice president, National Environmental  Trust: </p>
<p>   President Bush addressed concern over rising gas prices today  by announcing plans to waive the Clear Air Act summer fuel  requirements.  </p>
<p>   &quot;Instead of cracking down on oil companies for price gouging,  the president has opted to repeal clear air protections for  asthmatic children at the outset of smog season.&quot;</p>

<p>   &quot;The oil industry is breathing a sigh of relief, but the rest  of us aren't. Waiving the Clear Air Act does not solve our  nation's energy problems; it just leaves million of Americans  breathing dirtier air.&quot;</p>
<p>   &quot;These proposals are just the latest in a long line of failed  short-term solutions.  Bush can't undo five years of negligence  overnight, but he can still ensure that our nation has a brighter  energy future by supporting stronger fuel economy standards  today.&quot; </p>
<p>   BACKGROUND</p>
<p>   During April and May, gasoline refiners switch their fuel  blends for the summer months to help reduce smog.</p>
<p>   On hot summer days, nitrogen oxide pollution and volatile  organic compounds (VOCs) from cars, trucks and other sources is  baked into ozone smog, resulting in &quot;code red&quot; air quality.  Smog  poses a serious threat to children and seniors, triggering asthma  attacks and even causing permanent lung damage.  Recent studies  have shown that kids who play outside in high-smog areas are more  likely to develop childhood asthma.</p>

<p>   To help combat this problem, EPA requires gasoline refiners to  reformulate gasoline sold in the smoggiest areas; this gasoline  contains less VOCs, such as benzene (which is also a hazardous  air pollutant that causes cancer and aplastic anemia, a  potentially fatal blood disease). Other polluted areas can ask  EPA to include them in the reformulated gasoline marketing  program.  </p>
<p>   Even EPA disputes the notion that clean air protections are to  blame for higher gasoline prices.  To learn more, see EPA's past  testimony before the House Energy &amp; Commerce Committee: &quot;The run- up in gasoline prices earlier this year was primarily the result  of a steep increase in crude oil prices. We believe that  environmental regulations have had a minimal effect on gasoline  prices.&quot; </p>
