<p>WASHINGTON - August 9 - Larry Cox, Amnesty  International USA's executive director, issued the following  statement in response to news reports that the Bush  administration has drafted amendments to the War Crimes Act that  would essentially remove the possibility of prosecution for  American nationals, including political appointees, CIA officers,  contractors and former military personnel, accused of humiliating  and degrading war detainees: </p>
<p>   &quot;This latest administration attempt to provide cover for those  who created and implemented its failed war on terror policies  that violated U.S. and international law is deplorable. Since the  September 11 attacks, the administration has attempted to  immunize its people from prosecution for breaching the Geneva  Conventions and other laws through crafty legal interpretations.  Now that the Supreme Court has affirmed the rule of law and the  applicability of Common Article 3 of the Conventions, President  Bush is looking to limit the War Crimes Act through legislation.  The administration should stop seeking escape valves for those  who have committed crimes and instead use its energy to hold  perpetrators accountable.&quot;
