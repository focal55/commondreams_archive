<p>AUSTIN, Texas - June 22 - The following was  released today by the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence  regarding Texas Republicans' opposition to the Brady Law:</p>
<p>   There are a million stories in the Texas Republican party  platform completed last week:  Hatred of gays, opposition to a  minimum wage, opposition to the endangered species act,  establishment of Christianity as a national religion.</p>
<p>   And opposition to the Brady Law.  The platform calls for the  abolishment of background checks on firearm purchases mandated by  the Brady Law, which has prevented some million and a half  criminals from purchasing guns. </p>
<p>   The language appears under the heading Promoting Individual  Freedom and Personal Safety.  &quot;The Party calls on the Legislature  and the Congress to repeal the 'Brady Law' and all other laws  under their jurisdiction that infringe on the right to bear arms  and to reject any monitoring of gun ownership, excessive taxation  or regulation of making and selling of guns and ammunition.&quot; It  can be found on Page P21 of the state party platform, which can  be accessed at <a href="http://www.texasgop.org">http://www.texasgop.org</a>.</p>
<p>   What must mainstream Republicans think of their party's  platform, a platform so very far from mainstream Texans, whether  they are Republicans, Democrats, or Independents?</p>
<p>   &quot;Call me a conservative, but I believe we should not only bar  felons from buying guns -- we should actually check to see if  they're felons,&quot; said Marsha McCartney, a Dallas resident who is  a member of the Board of Trustees of the Brady Campaign to  Prevent Gun Violence.  &quot;I feel sorry for all my Republican  friends who have to deal with the embarrassment of being  associated with the Neanderthal views the state Republicans have  announced the party stands for. It's like a bad cartoon.&quot;</p>
