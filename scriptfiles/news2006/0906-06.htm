<p>WASHINGTON - September 6 - “Keep commercials out of children’s 
                  books!” That’s the message the Campaign for a Commercial-Free 
                  Childhood (CCFC) and the <a href="http://www.abfc.com/">
                  Association of Booksellers for Children</a> (ABC) are sending 
                  Running Press, publisher of <i>Cathy’s Book</i>: <i>If Found 
                  Call (650) 226-8233</i>, the first young adult &nbsp;novel to 
                  include product placement.&nbsp; The book, scheduled for 
                  publication this fall, will incorporate Cover Girl brand 
                  makeup into its plot for promotional purposes.&nbsp; CCFC and ABC 
                  have launched a campaign to urge Running Press, an imprint of 
Perseus Books, to remove advertising from the novel.
<p class="MsoNormal">“Children’s books have always been a 
                  refuge from commercials,” said CCFC’s Dr. Susan Linn, author 
                  of <i>Consuming Kids.</i> &nbsp;“If we let this go unchallenged, 
                  books--like television, movies and videogames—will become 
                  vehicles for pushing products on children.&nbsp; And the last thing 
                  young girls need is a cosmetics ad disguised as a novel.”</p>
                  <p class="MsoNormal">CCFC has initiated an email campaign 
                  urging concerned parents and book-lovers to send letters to 
                  Running Press demanding that the product placement be removed 
                  before <i>Cathy’s Book</i> is published. ABC members will make
                  <a href="http://www.commercialfreechildhood.org/actions/storepetition.htm">petitions</a> available 
                  in their bookstores. </p>
                  <p class="MsoNormal">“As a group, children’s booksellers care 
                  deeply about their mission to provide the best possible books 
                  for the children and families,” said ABC Executive Director 
                  Kristen McLean. “They know that the right book can play an 
                  important role in shaping the ideas of a young reader in an 
                  increasingly complex world. Books are an incredibly personal 
                  medium, and introducing product placement into a children’s 
                  book is a troubling trend that will open up the door to 
                  advertisers hungry for an effective way to reach new and 
                  impressionable consumers.”</p>
                  <p class="MsoNormal">Product placement is increasingly used to 
                  target children in television, films and videogames.&nbsp; It’s 
                  particularly insidious because products are seamlessly 
                  integrated into content. &nbsp;</p>
                  <p class="MsoNormal">“The only way to avoid product placement 
                  in electronic media is to limit children’s access,” said Dr. 
                  Linn.&nbsp; “Should we expect parents to limit reading as well?” 
                  ask your local bookstore to join the campaign by displaying 
                  one of our petitions.&nbsp;</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
