<p>WASHINGTON - January 10 - ConvictBushCheney.org  (CBC) is compiling clear and convincing evidence of High Crimes  and War Crimes committed by George W. Bush, Richard Cheney and  the Bush/Cheney Administration. Drawing upon investigations by  experts and respected organizations, mainstream media reports,  and other reliable sources, CBC publishes evidence of torture and  abuse of detainees, spying on U.S. citizens, willful deception  and other misconduct during the run up to war, leaking classified  information, improper acts of retaliation against administration  critics, and other facts which constitute grounds for criminal  indictment and conviction of Bush and Cheney.</p>
<p>   CBC Editor Mike Hersh explains, &quot;ConvictBushCheney.org  supports efforts to investigate, censure, impeach, indict, and  convict Bush and Cheney -- including Rep. John Conyers'  resolutions: H.Res.635 creating a select committee to investigate  and make recommendations on grounds for impeachment, H.Res.636 to  censure Bush, and H.Res.637 to censure Cheney.&quot;</p>
<p>   On Tuesday, Jan. 10, at 1:30 p.m., retired CIA analyst Ray  McGovern, authors William Blum and Larry Everest, Mike Hersh  (Progressive Democrats of America / After Downing Street), Kevin  Zeese (director, Democracy Rising), Travis Morales (World Can't  Wait), Code Pink, and others will deliver indictments to the  White House and Department of Justice. See:  <a href="http://releases.usnewswire.com/redir.asp?ReleaseID=59054&Link=http://www.bushcommission.org">http://www.bushcommission.org</a> for more information.</p>

<p>   A press conference will follow delivery of the indictments,  which allege illegal acts by the Bush Administration including,  Wars of Aggression, Torture and Indefinite Detention, Destruction  of the Global Environment, Attacks on Global Public Health and  Reproductive Rights, Failure of the Bush administration to  protect life during and after Hurricane Katrina. The indictments  result from testimony presented before the International  Commission of Inquiry on Crimes Against Humanity Committed by the  Bush Administration, organized by the Not in Our Name Statement  of Conscience and is endorsed by: Center for Constitutional  Rights, National Lawyers Guild, After Downing Street.Org and  others, including Former Sen. James Abourezk, former British MP  Tony Benn, authors Gore Vidal and Howard Zinn, poet Lawrence  Ferlinghetti, and actor Edward Asner.   Former UN envoy to Iraq  Denis Halliday, Guantanamo prisoners' lawyer Michael Ratner, and  former State Department officer Anne Wright participated in the  commission hearings. </p>
<p>   Afterdowningstreet.org -- a coalition of over 100 veterans',  peace, and activist groups which urge Congress and the media to  investigate whether President Bush has committed impeachable  offenses -- is hosting the ConvictBushCheney.org website.</p>
