<p>WASHINGTON - May 2 - A 10-day fast at the University of Miami by Eliseo Medina, Executive Vice President of SEIU, ended yesterday as an agreement was signed giving 450 poverty-wage janitors the right to form a union and raise living standards for their families.
<p>The agreement came on the same day that millions of immigrant workers and their supporters took part in a national day of action to highlight their contribution to the nation.</p>

<p>Before Medina&#8217;s fast, 10 janitors and 6 UM students had conducted a hunger strike that lasted 17 days. Hundreds of janitors at UM had been off the job for two months.</p>

<p>The agreement marked the second major victory recently for janitors in the South, following a victory by workers in major office buildings in Houston who joined SEIU late last year.</p>

<p>&#8220;Something special is happening in America,&#8221; Medina said. &#8220;The hard work immigrants do to achieve the American dream is starting to be recognized from north to south. The Miami janitors are showing that when workers stand up, their voices can be heard.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What we&#8217;ve done in Miami to unite workers with students and faculty can work on college campuses everywhere,&#8221; said UM janitor Maritza Paz.</p>

<p>The janitors&#8217; campaign drew support from many students, religious leaders, community organizations, and national leaders such as former U.S. Senator John Edwards and leaders of major unions that are part of the Change to Win Coalition that split from the AFL-CIO last year.</p>
