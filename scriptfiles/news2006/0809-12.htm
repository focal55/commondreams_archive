<p>WASHINGTON - August 9 - Today, Wednesday, August 9, WakeUpWalMart.com's &quot;2006 Change  Wal-Mart, Change America&quot; bus tour will make two stops, in  Cincinnati and Dayton, as part the tour's four-day swing through  Ohio. The tour is an exciting and unprecedented national bus tour  going to 19 states and 35 cities in 35 days with 1 mission - to  change Wal-Mart and change America for the better. </p>

<p>   In Dayton, as part of the tour, on at 5 p.m., at the  Montgomery County Courthouse Square, Congressional Candidate  Stephanie Studebaker, Montgomery County Commissioner Deb  Lieberman, Dayton City Commissioner Nan Whaley, State House  Candidate Dale Henry and WakeUpWalMart.com will hold a special  &quot;BETTER OHIO, BETTER AMERICA&quot; Town Hall/Community Meeting. The  town hall meeting will discuss the role Wal-Mart plays in  America's health care crisis and the company's impact on the  outsourcing of American jobs. </p>
<p>   At the town hall, Paul Blank, former 2004 presidential  campaign advisor to Howard Dean, and Chris Kofinis, former  presidential campaign advisor to Wesley Clark, will present a  PowerPoint presentation entitled &quot;A Costly Truth.&quot; The PowerPoint  will highlight, in graphic terms, why changing Wal-Mart is  important for Ohio and necessary for real political and social  change.  The presentation is modeled on Vice President Al Gore's  recent movie, &quot;An Inconvenient Truth.&quot; </p>
<p>   As an added visual, the &quot;2006 Change Wal-Mart, Change America&quot;  National Bus will be on display.  The 45-foot long, fully wrapped  bus (more like an enormous sized billboard), nicknamed &quot;Smiley,&quot;  is wrapped side-to-side and front-to-back in patriotic colors,  emblazoned with the American flag, and the name of the tour,  &quot;2006 Change Wal-Mart, Change America Tour.&quot;  In addition, on  each side of the bus, the message of the tour will be available  for all to see - including &quot;Join America's Fight for Health  Care.&quot;</p>
