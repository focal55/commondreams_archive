<p>WASHINGTON - January 18 - Members of the Congressional Progressive Caucus (CPC) will present an alternative, inclusive, and uplifting vision for the United States of America on the morning of the President's State of the Union address.  The Members will convene a special forum at the Democratic National Committee headquarters to propose a new direction for the country and articulate concrete plans for achieving change.  The meeting will feature Progressive Caucus leaders discussing issues ranging from how to bring our troops home from Iraq to ending the Republican culture of corruption and cronyism to healthcare reform to rebuilding New Orleans and the Gulf Coast and achieving broad-based economic growth.

<p>"The Congressional Progressive Caucus has a bold vision for America," said Rep. Woolsey.  "Our agenda speaks to hard working Americans who play by the rules and want a bright future for themselves and their families."

<p>“We offer a fresh, vigorous alternative for the 21st century, and we’re going to present an unapologetic plan that offers hope and a better quality of life for all Americans--- not just the powerful and privileged,” said U.S Representative Barbara Lee (D-CA), Co-Chair of the CPC.

<p>The Progressive Caucus news conference and follow-on panel discussions will highlight progressive priorities and ideas embodied in a set of  twenty articles published by the Members of the Caucus in a special issue of The Nation magazine: Paths to Renewal which will be available at www.thenation.com on January 19, 2006.
