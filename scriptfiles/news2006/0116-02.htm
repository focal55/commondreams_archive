<p>BOSTON - January 16 - Survivors of Pakistan's  devastating earthquake still face dangers and difficulties  100 days after the country's worst natural disaster warns Oxfam  International today.</p>
<p>   Conditions for earthquake survivors in the official camps  remain difficult, especially with the onset of the harsh  Himalayan winter, while inhabitants in many spontaneous camps are  finding that even their most basic needs are not being met. </p>
<p>   &quot;It's 100 days since the earthquake struck and we're still in  full lifesaving mode as this crisis shows no sign of abating.  We've been very lucky that the heavy snowfalls have only just  struck and the challenge now is to reach vulnerable people before  it's too late,&quot; says Farhana Faruqi Stocker, Oxfam's Pakistan  Country director.</p>
<p>   The difficult Himalayan terrain and rudimentary infrastructure  have presented local authorities and relief agencies literally  with a mountain to climb, with scores of villages entirely  inaccessible by road.</p>
<p>   Many existing roads were damaged during the quake and have  been frequently blocked by landslides caused by subsequent  tremors and rainfall, or by heavy snow brought on by the onset of  a harsh winter. </p>
<p>   The UN's relief operation has been hampered by a lack of  pledges to the UN's earthquake appeal fund. Barely half of the  funds appealed for -- $300 million of the $549 million  required -- has materialised to date. </p>
<p>   &quot;The international community must support the Pakistani  authorities and the UN to improve co-ordination and management of  the relief effort,&quot; says Stocker. </p>
<p>   &quot;Internationally agreed minimum standards for camp  management -- the Sphere standards -- must at least be reached  and the transition from military to civilian responsibility must  proceed carefully and sensitively.&quot;</p>
<p>   People in smaller spontaneous camps have missed out on aid  provisions owing to confusion over responsibility for food  distribution as well as other urgently needed items.</p>
<p>   The worsening weather has brought new -- albeit  predictable -- dangers. Most tents rushed to the earthquake zone  in the aftermath of the quake were unsuitable for winter  conditions. Like many other NGOs, Oxfam has been busy winterising  the tents it provided as well as providing materials to build  sturdier shelters. </p>
<p>   But Oxfam's warnings of a possible second humanitarian  disaster still apply to the most vulnerable -- children and the  elderly -- trying to shelter in flimsy tents in remote areas  above the snowline where access to aid deliveries has been  difficult. </p>
<p>   Cold-related illnesses such as pneumonia have risen as  temperatures have fallen, and several deaths have been reported  across the region.</p>
<p>   The struggle to stay warm -- especially in crowded spontaneous  camps -- has posed its own hazards, with reports of several  fatalities and injuries from tent fires that blazed out of  control. However, with temperatures plummeting to -15C in some  areas, authorities in Pakistani-administered Kashmir have decided  to provide paraffin stoves to camp residents.</p>
<p>   Oxfam strongly believes the reconstruction planning and  implementation must accelerate to help earthquake survivors  rebuild their lives. In Pakistani Kashmir alone, 80 percent of  crops and 50 percent of arable land was destroyed and more than  100,000 cattle were killed.</p>
<p>   Attention must also be paid to the issue of land and  relocation, especially for women -- many of whom have been left  widowed and without legal proof of property. </p>
<p>   Moreover, these efforts must do more than return people to the  dire poverty many suffered before the disaster -- what is needed  is &quot;reconstruction-plus&quot;. The authorities should also ensure that  reconstruction lessens vulnerability to future earthquakes. The  awarding of building contracts should include references to  earthquake-resistant standards, for example.</p>
<p>   At a meeting of 65 international donor countries on 19th  November, $5.8 billion was pledged to Pakistan's government for  rehabilitation and reconstruction.</p>
<p>   &quot;Worryingly, a large amount of the pledges (about $4 billion)  are in loans -- albeit soft loans -- and concerns remain over the  sustainability of debt repayments,&quot; explains Oxfam spokesperson  Stocker</p>
<p>   Over three million people were affected when an earthquake  registering 7.6 on the Richter scale rocked northern Pakistan on  8th October, reducing hundreds of towns and villages to rubble. </p>
<p>   It is estimated that at least 73,000 people were killed  directly and a greater number left injured in  Pakistani-administered Kashmir and neighbouring North West  Frontier Province.</p>
<p>   Around 2.5 million people were left homeless. About 185,000 of  the displaced are living in over 40 official and 333 spontaneous  registered camps. Numerous smaller unregistered 'tent villages'  have also sprung up.  </p>
<p>   More than two million have been dependent on food  aid -- roughly half of those relying on relief agencies. Serious  problems in the provision of food to many earthquake survivors  remain.</p>
<p>   Oxfam is involved in over 131 camps across the earthquake-hit  region, providing water and sanitation facilities to more than  300,000 people so far.</p>
<p>   More than 180,000 have received shelter assistance, including  tents and materials to build sturdier structures known as bandis.</p>
<p>    ------ </p>
<p>   EDITOR'S NOTES: </p>
<p>   Humanitarian situation </p>
<p>   -- An estimated 400,000 survivors are living above the snow  line. At least 18 deaths have been reported from the cold so far  but this doesn't amount to an increase in the usual mortality  rate. However, cases of pneumonia are on the increase and severe  upper respiratory diseases amount to 80 percent of health cases  treated in the area. </p>
<p>   -- Of the two million made homeless by the earthquake, around  20 percent are estimated to be actually displaced from their area  of origin, with 1.7 million living in tents. A still undefined  number of those who lost their homes in the quake remain either  in the mountains -- often in 'tent villages'.  </p>
<p>   -- The first phase of operation 'Winter Race', (the UN's term  for the programme to meet the urgent winter needs) has now been  completed. Phase One targeted those above 5000ft, but the relief  operation is now increasingly focusing on shelter programmes to  lower altitudes. Over 3.3 million corrugated galvanized iron  (CGI) sheets, and 4.8 million blankets have been distributed and  around 133,000 transitional shelters have been constructed as  part of the 'winterisation' process. </p>
<p>   Unmet needs </p>
<p>   -- Overcrowded camps, with poor drainage, are becoming  increasingly unbearable as the weather worsens. Only a handful of  camps meet Sphere standards -- the internationally agreed minimum  standards for a disaster response. Drainage has become a real  problem as rain and snow has fallen.</p>
<p>   -- Most tents rushed to the region -- intended as a stop gap  measure -- were unsuitable for harsh winter conditions. Of the  more than 250,000 tents distributed, 74 percent were not  adequately 'winterised' as of mid-December. </p>
<p>   -- Large gaps remain in the provision of food in both planned  and spontaneous camps.  People still do not have access to  necessary heating equipment, or to appropriate and adequate food  to sustain them in freezing temperatures. The World Food  Programme estimates that about 40 percent of those people in need  of support are not receiving enough. </p>
<p>   What needs to happen? </p>
<p>   -- The quantity and quality of the relief effort must be  scaled up to address gaps and needs, while ensuring that all  humanitarian agencies understand and apply humanitarian  principles in the delivery of relief assistance.</p>
<p>   -- Coordination needs to be improved in order to address the  gaps. UN agencies must provide the necessary leadership in  identifying the appropriate actors to fill these gaps.  The UN,  donors and the Government of Pakistan must include NGOs in  strategic coordination mechanisms for relief and recovery  planning and delivery. </p>
<p>   -- Better camp management in many of the spontaneous camps is  urgently needed. Policies and roles in camp management -- which  impact on the coordination of delivery of relief in camps -- need  to be clearly defined and fully supported at all levels, ensuring  that clear and transparent policies are fully implemented and  communicated to all those responsible for delivering relief.  The  UN needs to ensure that any lack of clarity on camp management  does not damage coordination of relief assistance. </p>
<p>   -- The UN relief operation continues to be plagued by a poor  response from international donors. The UN fund has only  56 percent of the total required to sustain the relief efforts  through the winter. Donors have generously pledged a large amount  to the Government of Pakistan's relief and reconstruction  efforts.  But these pledges must be fulfilled quickly. </p>
