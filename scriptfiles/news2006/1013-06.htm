<p>LONDON - October 13 - "Poverty is both a cause and a consequence of the failure to respect human rights: both economic, social and cultural as well as political and civil. It is driven by human rights violations and perpetuates further abuses. Today's announcement by the Nobel Peace Prize Committee reinforces Amnesty International's message that poverty is a major threat to human dignity and an obstacle to promoting peace and justice, but that it is not inevitable and can be overcome through the creativity and courage of individuals and the power of group mobilization," said Irene Khan, Secretary General of Amnesty International.

<p>"Muhammad Yunus and Grameem Bank have shown that the poor and the marginalized are not victims and survivors but agents of change. As a former Nobel Peace Laureate and an organization that is devoted to changing the human rights scene through the power of individuals, Amnesty International believes that this Award has given hope to millions of ordinary people around the world that they have the power to bring about extraordinary change."
