<b>General Situation</b>

<p>Ø The number of casualties continues to increase. 
<p>Ø In one single incident, nine members of the same family – seven children and their parents – were killed in an air strike in Gaza city. 
<p>Ø As a result of the military operations, a number of water distribution pipes have been destroyed.

<p><b>ICRC Action </b>

<p>Ø On 11 July, the ICRC visited 33 detained senior officials of the Palestinian Authority, including eight ministers and several members of the Palestinian Legislative Council. They are held at Ayalon Prison. The ICRC transmitted messages with family news and delivered some assistance to the detainees. The ICRC will repeat its visits these persons on a regular basis, in order to monitor their conditions of detention and treatment. It will not communicate publicly on its observations, but true to its practice, it will report any problems observed to the detaining authorities directly and confidentailly. 

<p>Ø Three ambulances were processed through Erez cross point and handed over to the Palestine Red Crescent Society. 

<p>Ø 110 food parcels, 54 hygienic kits and 23 jerry cans were distributed to isolated and displaced families south of the Gaza Strip (in Al-Shoka and Rafah) 

<p>Ø An ICRC team visited one of the wounded survivors of the attack on the house destroyed by an air strike in Gaza city as well as the site where the tragic incident took place, in order to document the case.
