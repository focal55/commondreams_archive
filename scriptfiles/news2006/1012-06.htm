<p>WASHINGTON - October 12 - Amnesty International  is disappointed at today's ruling of the Court of Appeal of  England and Wales that the United Kingdom government is not  obliged to intervene on behalf of UK residents held at Guantanamo  Bay.</p>
<p>   &quot;The Court of Appeal has missed an opportunity to send a clear  message to the UK government that it must fulfill its  responsibilities towards all Guantanamo detainees, regardless of  whether they are UK citizens or residents,&quot; said Nicola  Duckworth, Amnesty International's Europe and Central Asia  Director.</p>
<p>   The Court's decision concerns a judicial review of the refusal  of the UK government to petition the U.S. authorities for the  release of three Guantanamo detainees: Bisher Al-Rawi, an Iraqi  national and long-term UK resident, Jamil Al-Banna, a Jordanian  national with refugee status in the UK, and Omar Deghayes, a  Libyan national with refugee status in the UK. So far, the UK  authorities have agreed to petition their U.S. counterparts to  seek the release and return to the United Kingdom only of Bisher  Al-Rawi. </p>
<p>   Amani Deghayes, sister of Omar Deghayes, told Amnesty  International:</p>
<p>   &quot;This is yet another painful day for us. Instead of standing  up for my brother, the government is pretending he's nothing to  do with them -- an illogical and inhumane attitude.&quot;</p>
<p>   &quot;Omar has already been held for over four years without charge  or trial -- a complete travesty of justice. We've always said  that we're not looking for special favors for my brother -- just  for his fundamental human rights to be respected.&quot; </p>
<p>   The UK government has obligations under domestic and  international law to make representations on behalf of all UK  residents still held at Guantanamo Bay to ensure that their human  rights are upheld. In the knowledge that the human rights of all  of those held at Guantanamo Bay have been violated, and continue  to be violated to date, Amnesty International considers that  there exists an additional obligation on the UK authorities to  demand that all UK residents be immediately returned to the UK.  Upon return, they should be either released or, should there be a  reasonable suspicion that they have committed a crime, they  should be promptly charged with a recognizably criminal offense  and tried, within reasonable time, in fair proceedings. </p>
<p>   &quot;The failure of the UK authorities to make representations on  behalf of all UK residents held at Guantanamo Bay is inconsistent  with the strong condemnation by a number of government members of  the detention center for its human rights abuses,&quot; said  Duckworth. </p>
<p>   &quot;Today's ruling of the Court of Appeal does not absolve the UK  authorities from their obligation to ensure that a full  independent and impartial investigation is held into the UK's  involvement in the cases of Bisher Al-Rawi and Jamil El-Banna,&quot;  added Duckworth.</p>
<p>   It has been alleged that the UK was involved in the arrest of  both men in the Gambia and their eventual rendition to U.S.  custody. The investigation must establish whether UK security  services were complicit in their detention and subsequent human  rights violations.</p>
