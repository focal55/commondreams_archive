<p>NEW YORK - February 10 - The Center for Constitutional Rights (CCR) today applauds the release of the Report on Guantanamo Detainees: A Profile of 517 Detainees Through Analysis of Department of Defense Data by Professor Mark Denbeaux of Seton Hall Law School and attorney Joshua Denbeaux.  

 

<p>Since February 2002, CCR has argued in the United States federal courts that the vast majority of prisoners at Guantánamo are innocent men who were kidnapped and turned over to the United States military for a bounty.  The report found that “55 percent of the 517 detainees had no hostile act listed as the basis for detention” and a mere 5 percent were captured by U.S. forces, with the rest not picked up on the battlefield in Afghanistan but in Pakistan and handed to the U.S. by warlords and others for large bounties.  According the report’s careful analysis of the Defense Department records, 92% of the prisoners in Guantanamo were not characterized as Al Qaeda fighters.  The men have been denied any fair hearing and detained in inhumane conditions for over four years, despite the Supreme Court ruling in CCR’s case, Rasul v. Bush that they have the right to challenge the basis for their detention in U.S. court.  

 

<p>Said CCR attorney Gita Gutierrez, “Now, for the first time, the military’s lies and misrepresentations about the prisoners in Guantanamo have been debunked through the military’s own documents. Yet, these men remain in prison while at every turn the Executive seeks to avoid judicial scrutiny of its unlawful conduct.”
