<p>March 29 - The East Timor and Indonesia Action Network (ETAN) 
denounced today's formal notice that the Department of State will 
consider provision of lethal military equipment to Indonesia. ETAN 
called it a major step undermining military reform and justice for 
the people of Indonesia and East Timor.

<p>The notice appeared in today's Federal Register stating "that 
requests for the export or retransfer of lethal defense articles to 
Indonesia (and defense services related to such lethal defense 
articles) pursuant to section 38 of the Arms Export Control Act will 
be considered on a case-by-case basis."

<p>The Bush administration's imprudent rush to expand assistance to the 
Indonesian military (TNI) is extremely alarming and short-sighted," 
said Karen Orenstein, National Coordinator of ETAN.

<p>As the cycle of impunity continues unabated in Indonesia, the State 
Department is set to resume lethal defense exports. The floodgates of 
assistance seem to be open," said Orenstein. "Where is the 'carefully 
calibrated' approach toward aiding the TNI that the State Department 
promised last November after it waived congressional restrictions? 
Was the State Department's professed commitment to human rights and 
justice reform in Indonesia in justifying the waiver simply hollow rhetoric?"

<p>In February, the Bush administration proposed a six and a half fold 
increase in Foreign Military Financing for Indonesia. In early March, 
Admiral William F. Fallon, Commander of the U.S. Pacific Command, 
urged a "rapid, concerted infusion of assistance" to the Indonesian military.

<p>"The U.S. needs a forward-looking policy toward Indonesia that 
promotes genuine accountability for human rights crimes and real 
reform of its corrupt military. Providing military assistance will 
undermine both," said Orenstein.

<p>Last November, the Department of State issued a waiver removing all 
remaining congressional restrictions on U.S. military assistance to 
Indonesia. Congress had imposed various restrictions since 1992.

<p>East Timor's Commission for Reception, Truth and Reconciliation has 
called on countries to make military assistance to Indonesia "totally 
conditional on progress towards full democratization, the 
subordination of the military to the rule of law and civilian 
government, and strict adherence with international human rights..."

<p>ETAN advocates for democracy, justice and human rights for East Timor 
and Indonesia. ETAN calls for an international tribunal to prosecute 
crimes against humanity committed in East Timor from 1975 to 1999 and 
for continued restrictions on U.S. military assistance to Indonesia 
until there is genuine reform of its security forces. For additional
