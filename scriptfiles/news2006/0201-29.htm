<p>OAKLAHOMA CITY  - February 1 - The American Civil Liberties Union filed a 
friend-of-the-court brief today urging an Oklahoma court to dismiss charges 
against a Southern Baptist minister who was arrested for soliciting private sex 
with another male.
<P>&#8220;The Supreme Court has made it crystal clear that, when it comes to their sex 
lives, consenting adults are free to do whatever they please in private,&#8221; said 
Joann Bell, Executive Director of the ACLU of Oklahoma.&nbsp; &#8220;According to the 
police report, Rev. Latham did nothing more than invite another man to his hotel 
room for consensual sex.&nbsp; It is not a crime merely to invite someone to 
have completely lawful sex.&nbsp; If it were otherwise, every bar in the state 
may as well shut its doors.&#8221;</P>
<P>The Reverend Dr. Lonnie Latham was arrested on January 3, 2006, on the 
misdemeanor charge of &#8220;Offering to Engage in an Act of Lewdness.&#8221;&nbsp; 
According to the police report, he approached a male plainclothes police officer 
and invited the officer back to his hotel room for oral sex.&nbsp; It is not 
alleged that Latham offered money in exchange for the sex act.&nbsp; </P>
<P>The brief filed today in the District Court of Oklahoma County argues that 
charges should be dismissed against Latham because non-commercial sex between 
consenting adults in private is a constitutionally protected activity.&nbsp; 
According to the ACLU it is a violation of the Constitution&#8217;s free speech 
guarantee for the state to criminalize speech that is merely an invitation to 
engage in lawful behavior.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Latham&#8217;s arrest, which generated a significant amount of media attention, 
forced him to resign from his position as a board member of the Baptist General 
Convention of Oklahoma.</P>
