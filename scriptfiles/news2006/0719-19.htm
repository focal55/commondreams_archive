<p>WASHINGTON - July 19 - Catholics in Alliance for the Common Good (Catholics in Alliance) today launched a multi-year public education, media, and grassroots outreach effort to promote an authentic Christian social vision in the national dialogue on religion and public life.  The group seeks to advance the voice of the Catholic social tradition in the public square, and to provide accurate information to Catholics, the media, and Americans of all faiths about Church teaching on justice, human dignity, freedom, and the common good.

<p>“At the core of Catholic teaching is a moral obligation to promote the common good,” said Catholics in Alliance Executive Director Alexia Kelley. “This includes looking out for the least fortunate and creating a society in which we as citizens care about our neighbors as ourselves.  Concern for the common good challenges a go-it-alone culture of excessive greed in which politicians cut deals with lobbyists, CEOs cut off pensions, and materialism undermines families and communities.  A culture of the common good restores what is best in America – a sense of justice and opportunity larger than ourselves.”

<p>Catholics in Alliance (<a href="http://www.thecatholicalliance.org" target="_new">www.thecatholicalliance.org</a>) emerged from a growing movement of Catholic organizations, laypeople, theologians, priests, and women religious (nuns) who are committed to building a society in which all persons have the opportunity to reach their full human potential.  Presently, Catholics in Alliance works with some 15 Catholic partner organizations representing thousands of Catholics, Catholic clergy, and women religious nationwide, including the Leadership Conference of Women Religious, the Conference of Major Superiors of Men, and the Franciscan Federation. 

<p>“There is a need to shed light on the great moral matters of our day, including poverty, family insecurity, inequities in education and healthcare, war, torture, and the looming crisis of global climate change,” said Rev. Charles Currie, S.J., president of the Association of Jesuit Colleges and Universities (AJCU).  “Catholics in Alliance will play a key role in fostering the dialogue on these important issues.”

<p>At the core of the Catholics in Alliance communications effort is Voices for the Common Good, a bureau of Catholic leaders available to provide the press with Catholic perspectives on contemporary issues.  In addition to maintaining rapid-response media operations, Catholics in Alliance publishes a nonpartisan voting guide addressing matters of Catholicism and public life, and supports a “grassroots” outreach program to promote Catholic Social Teaching at the parish and community level. It also serves as a public networking space for Catholic organizations and leaders dedicated to the common good.  All efforts are informed and inspired by the Catholic Church’s body of social teachings, in particular the Vatican’s recent Compendium of the Social Doctrine of the Church.  

<p>“In this era of political division and highly-charged debate over the role of faith in public life, it is easy to lose sight of the unifying moral priority to care for all humanity,” said Kelley.  “It is important to provide the media, Catholics and people of all faiths with accurate perspectives on Catholic teaching.  We look forward to amplifying the voices of all those dedicated to the common good.”
