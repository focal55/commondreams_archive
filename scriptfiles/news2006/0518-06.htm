<p>WASHINGTON - May 18 - Today&#8217;s Senate Judiciary Committee vote for a federal marriage amendment is deplorable, according to Americans United for Separation of Church and State.
<P>S. J. Res. 1, the so-called &#8220;Marriage Protection Act,&#8221; passed the committee on a party-line vote of 10-8. The action took place behind closed doors in a room off the Senate floor.</P>
<P>&#8220;This is an outrage,&#8221; said the Rev. Barry W. Lynn, Americans United executive director. &#8220;It&#8217;s bad enough that the Senate is trying to wed church and state in unholy matrimony, but it&#8217;s even worse that they did it behind closed doors.&#8221;</P>
<P>Americans United has urged the Senate to reject the constitutional amendment, charging that it enshrines the marriage rituals of the country&#8217;s majority faiths in the Constitution and undercuts separation of church and state. </P>
<P>&#8220;Senate leaders clearly are bowing to the demands of the Religious Right,&#8221; said Lynn. &#8220;This is election-year grandstanding for the benefit of Pat Robertson, James Dobson and other disgruntled Religious Right leaders.&#8221;</P>
<P>The marriage amendment, which mandates that marriage in America &#8220;shall consist only of the union of a man and a woman,&#8221; now moves to the Senate floor where a vote is expected the week of June 5.</P>
<P id=aboutau>Americans United is a religious liberty watchdog group based in Washington, D.C. Founded in 1947, the organization educates Americans about the importance of church-state separation in safeguarding religious freedom.</P>
