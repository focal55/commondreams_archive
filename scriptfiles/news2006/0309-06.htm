<p>WASHINGTON - March 9 - As the international 
spotlight focuses on the Darfur crisis ahead of Friday's African Union 
meeting to discuss peacekeeping efforts in the troubled region, Africa 
Action today released its Africa Policy Outlook 2006. This annual 
publication forecasts the key issues and developments in Africa policy 
in the coming year, and analyzes trends in U.S. relations with Africa 
under the current administration. The "Africa Policy Outlook 2006" is 
now available at 
<a href="http://www.africaaction.org/resources/docs/PolicyOutlook06.pdf">http://www.africaaction.org/resources/docs/PolicyOutlook06.pdf</a><p>Africa Action's Executive Director Salih Booker, co-author of the Policy 
Outlook, said, "This year, Africa will witness a new wave of U.S. 
soldiers landing on the continent for training and other missions, as 
Washington takes aim at reshaping Africa to better serve America's 
security interests. But American involvement in actual peacemaking or 
peacekeeping missions in Africa is far less likely, even as genocide 
continues in Darfur, Sudan."

<p>The "Policy Outlook 2006" analyzes last year's "compassionate 
showmanship" by the Bush Administration and other rich country leaders 
and the reality of the promises made on aid, debt cancellation, and 
HIV/AIDS. It also probes the current trends in U.S. Africa policy that 
often receive less scrutiny but that are, in fact, very revealing - the 
expanding U.S. military presence on the continent and the U.S. pursuit 
of Africa's oil resources.

<p>Ann-Louise Colgan, Director of Policy Analysis & Communications and 
co-author of this year's report said, "When it comes to U.S. relations 
with Africa, the pre-occupation of U.S. officials with conventional 
geo-strategic concerns stands in stark contrast to the expressed concern 
of the American people regarding the ongoing genocide in Darfur and 
global health challenges like HIV/AIDS and the Avian flu. Africa's human 
development challenges remain urgent despite last year's proclaimed 
Africa focus by rich country leaders."

<p>Africa Action notes that some of the largest countries on the African 
continent currently face insecurity and conflict, though most are in the 
process of a transition requiring U.S. and international support this 
year. When it comes to Sudan, Africa Action emphasizes the "hierarchy of 
geo-strategic interests" that guides U.S. policy toward this key 
country, and charges that the Bush Administration's intelligence-sharing 
relationship with Khartoum continues to inhibit its response to the 
ongoing genocide in Darfur, where a United Nations intervention is 
urgently needed.

<p>Booker and Colgan note, "In 2006, the narrow notion of security promoted 
within current U.S. Africa policy, and the attendant rejection of the 
more holistic concept of 'human security', will be challenged by the 
growing threat posed by public health concerns and other global issues. 
This dichotomy will also highlight the divide between African priorities 
and American imperatives on today's most urgent global challenges."

<p>The "Africa Policy Outlook 2006" is now available on the organization's 
website at <a href="http://www.africaaction.org/">http://www.africaaction.org/</a><!-- #EndEditable -->
