<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON - May 25 - With a vote in the Senate on immigration reform pending, the 
American Civil Liberties Union urged lawmakers to oppose the flawed legislation 
that fails to protect privacy and due process rights.</font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Our fundamental freedoms should not be undermined through a flawed 
immigration reform bill," said Caroline Fredrickson, Director of the ACLU 
Washington Legislative Office. "The Senate bill is filled with provisions that 
unnecessarily compromise our freedoms and privacy and place undue burdens on the 
American worker. The Senate must reject this unsound legislation."</font></P><P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The House had already adopted its immigration reform bill late last year, 
with an "enforcement-only" approach to immigration. While the Senate bill had 
initially rejected a similar approach, recently adopted amendments have brought 
the Senate bill closer to the flawed approach taken by the House. For example, 
the Senate passed an amendment authorizing the building of 370 miles of fencing 
along the Mexican border, and an amendment to make English the official 
"national" language. </font></P><P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The ACLU, while opposing the requirement in the bill that all employers check 
all new hires against a government database, applauded the worker protection, 
due process and privacy protections that the Senate added to the employment 
verification provisions of the bill. Under the bill as amended, workers would 
have a real administrative and judicial process for challenging erroneous 
government data that results in denial of work, and could recover back pay if 
that happens. The ACLU called on the House to support those protections in the 
upcoming conference negotiations.</font></P><P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The ACLU also decried provisions in the bill that would expand the indefinite 
detention of non-citizens ordered deported to countries that will not accept 
them and that penalize as "smuggling" some humanitarian assistance provided to 
refugees by churches and other charitable organizations.</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"The Senate bill must be rejected," said Timothy Sparapani, an ACLU 
Legislative Counsel. "Congress must not pass an immigration bill until these 
flawed provisions are corrected." </font></P><P align=left><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The ACLU letter to Senate on the immigration bill can be read
