<p>WASHINGTON - August 11 -  August 22 marks the tenth anniversary of President Clinton signing 
into law "The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity 
Reconciliation Act of 1996."

<p>GWENDOLYN MINK, wendymink@yahoo.com, 
<a href="http://ebookpreview.abc-clio.com/?bookid=1576076083&loc=cover">http://ebookpreview.abc-clio.com/?bookid=1576076083&loc=cover</a><p>  Co-editor of the two-volume "Poverty in the United States: An 
Encyclopedia of History, Politics and Policy," Mink said today: 
"Congress changed the welfare law last February, stepping up federal 
disciplinary control of mothers who need benefits -- primarily by 
increasing the work participation rate each state must meet. Congress 
also created a funding stream for marriage and fatherhood promotion 
projects and invited states to divert their own TANF [Temporary 
Assistance for Needy Families] spending from cash assistance to marriage 
promotion. The Bush Administration has now produced new regulations for 
TANF, further tightening the vise on low income families on TANF. When 
they take effect, the new rules will narrow the range of endeavors that 
count towards satisfying the work requirement and will vastly increase 
the policing of welfare mothers by welfare bureaucrats. The rules demand 
that various activities be 'supervised not less than daily,' including 
homework. The already harsh welfare regime ushered in by Clinton-era 
welfare reform is about to become even more brutal, impoverishing and 
unforgiving. To paraphrase famed welfare rights activist Johnnie Tilmon, 
the brutal work regime within TANF will go hand-in-hand with the 
pro-marriage family formation regime to pressure low income mothers to 
trade welfare for 'a man.' This gives the lie to the mantra of personal 
independence."

<p>IRENE WEISER, iw@stopfamilyviolence.org, <a href="http://www.stopfamilyviolence.org">www.stopfamilyviolence.org</a><p> Weiser, executive director of Stop Family Violence, said today: "The 
new TANF law appropriates $150 million per year for five years for 
ideologically driven, unproven and potentially dangerous Marriage 
Promotion and Responsible Fatherhood Programs. Few people realize that 
nearly two thirds of welfare recipients are victims of domestic 
violence; one third of them are currently being abused and depend on 
public assistance to help them escape to safety and rebuild their lives. 
Now, instead of receiving the help they need to recover from the abuse 
and become self-sufficient through education, domestic violence, mental 
health and substance abuse services, they will be encouraged to 
participate in programs that will prolong their involvement with, and 
make them economically dependant upon, their abusers. To put the scale 
of this misguided spending in perspective, the president's 2007 budget 
requested a mere $177 million for all the Health and Human Services 
programs in the Violence Against Women Act, $143 million less than 
Congress was authorized to spend."

<p>AVIS JONES-DeWEEVER, avis@iwpr.org
<p> Jones-DeWeever is director of Poverty, Education and Social Justice 
Programs at the Institute for Women's Policy Research. She said today: 
"Lost amid all of the 10th anniversary celebratory discussions that 
equate caseload reduction to welfare reform success is the on-the-ground 
reality of families continuing to live at the margins, struggling to 
make it, but in recent years, falling further and further behind. If the 
true goal of welfare reform is to spur self-sufficiency, then we must 
make sure that individuals have access to the tools that will create 
economic well-being and not merely be satisfied with shifting people 
from the welfare rolls to the rolls of the working poor. We can do 
better than that. By far, the best route towards true economic success 
is access to higher education; and welfare reform has greatly 
constricted that opportunity for those who arguably need it the most. To 
move welfare participants not only from welfare to work but into good 
jobs with good wages and, ultimately, into better futures, we must open 
up the doors to higher education and, in the process, get beyond the 
current narrowly focused, work-first approach which ultimately leaves 
most stuck in the dead-end, insecure doldrums of low-wage work."
<p>   Dr. Jones-DeWeever recently authored the report "Resilient and 
Reaching for More: Challenges and Benefits of Higher Education for 
Welfare Participants and Their Children," available as a PDF file at <a href="http://www.iwpr.org/pdf/D466.pdf">http://www.iwpr.org/pdf/D466.pdf<http://www.iwpr.org/pdf/D466.pdf></a>.
