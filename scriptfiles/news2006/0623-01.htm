<p>WASHINGTON - June 23 - &ldquo;There is no good reason for preventing a House vote on a clean $2.10 increase in the minimum wage,&rdquo; the AFL-CIO&rsquo;s legislative director said in a letter sent today to all members of the U.S. House of Representatives. The federal minimum wage has been frozen for nine years. 
<P>Republicans have come under increased pressure for their blockade of a minimum wage increase. Yesterday a majority of the Senate, 52 members, voted for a $2.10 increase in the minimum wage with no &ldquo;poison pills&rdquo; attached to prevent its passage, and &ldquo;it is widely believed that a majority of the House also supports the $2.10 increase,&rdquo; the letter notes. But there have also been hints that the Republican House leadership is considering a lesser increase with poison pill provisions designed to provoke opposition. </P><P>A 2005 study by the Economic Policy Institute showed that a lesser minimum wage increase would affect a minimal percentage of the population and fail to restore the purchasing power of the minimum wage. A second study released jointly by EPI and the Center on Budget and Policy Priority just this week showed that the purchasing power of the minimum wage has now hit a 51-year low. </P><P>Samuels pointed out that the $2.10 increase is a moral imperative in light of the $3,300 congressional pay raise cleared in the House last week. </P><P>&ldquo;Increasing the minimum wage is a statement about how we as a society value hard work,&rdquo; Samuel wrote, &ldquo;half-measures designed to benefit as few workers as possible are simply inadequate.&rdquo; </P><P>&ldquo;There is simply no excuse for using parliamentary maneuvers and &lsquo;poison pills&rsquo; to prevent a clean vote on a clean $2.10 increase in the minimum wage,&rdquo; he concluded.</P>
