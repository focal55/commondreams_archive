<p>NEW YORK - August 3 - <p><b>WHAT: </b>Nonviolent protests in 24 states to demand an end to nuclear weapons and wars.

<p><b>WHEN:</b> Sunday, Aug. 6, the anniversary of the bombing of Hiroshima; and Wednesday, Aug. 9, the anniversary of the bombing of Nagasaki and the United Nation's International Day of the World's Indigenous Peoples. Some events will be held on Saturday, Aug. 5. For a complete list of events, visit www.august6.org.

<p><b>WHERE:</b> National Nuclear Security Administration facilities where Bechtel is involved, including: Lawrence Livermore Laboratory (CA); Los Alamos Laboratory (NM); the Y-12 National Security Complex (Oak Ridge, TN); the Nevada Test Site near Las Vegas (NV); the Pantex nuclear weapons assembly plant (TX); the Portsmouth (OH) uranium enrichment plant; and Bettis Atomic Power Laboratory (PA).

<p>To mark the 61st anniversary of the U.S. atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, rallies, vigils, teach-ins, and nonviolent protests will be held in more than 60 cities in 24 states across the country to demand an end to nuclear weapons and wars. Antiwar, nuclear abolition and indigenous rights groups are focusing on facilities run by the Bechtel Corporation, one of the world's leading nuclear weapons contractors, war profiteers, and violators of indigenous rights. Activities will take place under the banner: From Hiroshima to Yucca Mountain to the Middle East: No Nukes! No Wars! End War Profiteering! Support Indigenous Rights!

<p>Notable speakers include: Keiji Tsuchiya, a Hibakusha (Hiroshima survivor) and Vice President of Okayama A-Bomb Sufferers Association (at Livermore Lab Aug. 6 and San Francisco Bechtel rally Aug. 9); Koji Kobayashi, a Hibakusha (at Universal Peace Day celebration, Riverside Church, New York City, Aug. 5); Antonia Juhasz, author and Bechtel scholar (at teach-in in Pittsburgh, Penn. Aug. 5 and San Francisco Bechtel rally Aug. 9); Norman Solomon, media critic and author (at Livermore Lab Aug. 6); and Daniel Ellsberg, Pentagon Papers whistleblower (at Livermore Lab Aug. 6).

<p>Jackie Cabasso, Executive Director of the Western States Legal Foundation and a member of UFPJ's Steering Committee, explained: "As we commemorate one of the most horrific acts of U.S. military policy -- the atomic bombings of the civilian populations of Hiroshima and Nagasaki -- our movement for peace and justice re-commits itself to the immediate task of ending the war and occupation in Iraq and bringing all of our troops home now. The August 5th-9th actions around the country will also bring attention to some of the most pressing issues of the day: the urgent need for a comprehensive ceasefire in the Lebanon/Israel/Gaza crisis; our demand for the global abolition of all nuclear weapons, starting with those in the U.S. arsenal; and stopping the outrageous war profiteering of giant corporations like Bechtel. As the nation's largest antiwar coalition, United for Peace and Justice is proud to be working with activists around the country on these local protests."
