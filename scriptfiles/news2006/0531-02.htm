<p>NEW YORK - May 31 - On the 25th anniversary of  the AIDS pandemic, thousands of people living with HIV/AIDS and  activists from around the world are protesting today outside  high-level United Nations meetings on HIV/AIDS. Expressing  outrage that 15 million people have died from AIDS since the U.N.  meetings in 2001, activists are demanding leaders implement  science-based HIV prevention and universal access to AIDS  treatment.</p>
<p>   George W. Bush's lead negotiator at the 2001 U.N. conference  on AIDS, Scott Evertz, told Reuters today that the Bush  administration is reaching out to militant Islamic governments,  to try to ensure the 2006 U.N. declaration backs abstinence and  fidelity.</p>
<p>   The diverse crowd of protesters, including members of civil  society delegations attending the U.N. meetings and many East  Coast AIDS service organizations, will take part in a rally  emceed by actress Rosie Perez. Perez says, &quot;People living with  HIV have a right to the treatment they need and all communities  have a right to effective prevention.  It is enraging that  despite leaders' promises to provide this, we still have to take  to the streets to demand action on these issues.&quot;</p>
<p>   Prominent AIDS activists from five continents are speaking at  the rally and highlighted the urgent need for vastly scaled-up  access to affordable HIV treatment and care programs. &quot;There is  broad international consensus that we need to commit to 10  million people on treatment by 2010 and that we need major new  funding plans to do that. It is inexcusable that some governments  are currently resisting this goal,&quot; says Sipho Mthathi of the  Treatment Access Campaign.  </p>
<p>   Activists are also focused on the need for prevention  strategies, including female and male condoms and harm reduction  programs, that are responsive to women, drug-users, men who have  sex with men, sex workers, and other vulnerable populations.   They are criticizing governments for neglecting these groups and  accusing the U.S. government of enacting highly-politicized and  ineffective prevention policies. </p>
<p>   This unique protest is bringing out people from as close as  New York's five boroughs and as far as Indonesia.  &quot;We need a  real action plan and funding promises to get drugs into bodies  and prevention tools to the people,&quot; states Waheedah Shabazz-El  of ACTUP Philadelphia.</p>
