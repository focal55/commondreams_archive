<p> JACKSON, Mississippi - March 28 - 
The American Civil Liberties Union today applauded the defeat 
of a dangerous and extreme abortion ban late last night in the Mississippi 
legislature.&nbsp; <BR>
&nbsp;<BR>&#8220;This extreme abortion ban would have 
threatened the health and lives of women across this state,&#8221; said Nsombi 
Lambright, Executive Director of the ACLU of Mississippi.&nbsp; &#8220;This is a great 
victory for the women of Mississippi and speaks to an active and growing 
pro-choice voice in the state that is fighting to ensure that all women can 
access the reproductive health care they need.&#8221;
<P>The ban, which Mississippi Governor Haley Barbour said he would have signed 
into law had it passed, came only weeks after a similar abortion ban became law 
in South Dakota.&nbsp; Last week, advocates for women&#8217;s health in South Dakota 
launched a grassroots campaign to repeal that measure at the polls in 
November.</P>
<P>&#8220;History has shown us that when women are denied access to abortion they may 
resort to desperate measures,&#8221; said Louise Melling, Director of the ACLU 
Reproductive Freedom Project.&nbsp; &#8220;The women of Mississippi would be better 
served if the legislature would focus on commonsense solutions aimed at reducing 
unintended pregnancy such as funding medically accurate sex education and 
ensuring access to birth control, including emergency contraception.&#8221;</P>
<P>The bill, which failed to pass last night after Senate and House negotiators 
were unable to reach an agreement, would have outlawed abortion in Mississippi, 
a state that is already failing when it comes to protecting access to 
reproductive health care.&nbsp; Ninety-eight percent of counties in the state 
are without an abortion provider, and in a recent report by the Guttmacher 
Institute, Mississippi ranked 30th in the nation in its efforts to help women 
avoid unintended pregnancy.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Similar bans on abortion are still pending in eight states: Alabama, Georgia, 
Kentucky, Louisiana, Missouri, Ohio, Oklahoma, and Tennessee.</P>
