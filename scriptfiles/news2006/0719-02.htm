<p>RESTON, Virginia – July 19 - On July 20, 2006, more than 150 medical student leaders from the American Medical Student Association (AMSA) will descend on Capitol Hill to lobby for the Health Partnership Act (S. 2772), a bipartisan bill that seeks to achieve affordable and sustainable health care for all Americans through a unique federal-state partnership within each state.

<p>Introduced by Senators George Voinovich (R-OH) and Jeff Bingaman (D-NM) on May 9, 2006, The Health Partnership Act aims to give states the power to experiment with models providing quality health care while covering all their residents. This bill has already secured endorsement from a number of organizations including the Universal Health Care Action Network, National Association of Community Health Centers, American Medical Association, AIDS Institute and National Physicians Alliance. As part of the AMSA Lobby Day, chapter officers from Ohio and New Mexico will present Senator Voinovich and Senator Bingaman with the AMSA Vision Award for Innovative Leadership in Health Care Reform.

<p>“We’re excited about the opportunity AMSA chapter officers have to engage in the political process, said Jay Bhatt, AMSA’s National President. “Now is the time for medical students to lead the movement for affordable health care for all Americans. We are already paying for ‘health care for all’ in the United States; we’re just not getting it.”

<p>AMSA’s Lobby Day enables medical student leaders to become an active part of policy making by visiting members of Congress and sharing their views on health care access for all. Lobby Day kicks off the three-day annual AMSA Chapter Officers’ Conference July 20-23, 2006 -- a unique gathering of student leaders. Keynote speakers at the conference include Dr. Gloria WilderBrathwaite, a social justice activist, and Dr. Woody Kessel, Assistant Surgeon General.
