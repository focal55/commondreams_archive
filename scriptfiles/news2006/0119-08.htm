<p>WASHINGTON - January 19 - National Organization for Women President Kim Gandy today sent a 
            letter to senators of both parties who have held themselves out as 
            supporters of women's rights, reminding them of the <A 
            href="http://lists.now.org/t/283614/149703/1232191/0/">danger posed 
            by Judge Samuel Alito</A> and asking them to wage a filibuster in 
opposition to his nomination.
<P>Considering Senate Republicans' consistent record of voting in 
            lock-step for Bush's judicial nominees, Alito likely has all 55 of 
            those votes sewn up, but we continue to hold out hope for a rare 
            glimpse of independence. Nonetheless, that places the responsibility 
            for protecting women's rights squarely on the Democrats, who must 
            rise to the occasion and use their prerogative to require sixty 
            votes&#8212;the filibuster. </P>
            <P>"Yes, we all know the numbers, and the reality of the imbalance 
            of power," Gandy wrote. "But the lives, hopes, and futures of our 
            girls and women, our hard-working families, our seniors, our 
            children, our neighbors who face physical, mental and economic 
            challenges, depend on you."</P>
            <P>Gandy reminded senators of Alito's reversal of the Family and 
            Medical Leave Act, his refusal to hold a school responsible for 
            sexual harassment, and his memorandum mapping out the overturn of 
            <EM>Roe v. Wade</EM>. </P>
            <P>"Your commitment to women's rights is hollow if you will not 
            fight to preserve them," Gandy wrote to senators. "NOW, with our 
            legions of everyday supporters who are the 'foot soldiers' in our 
            fight to protect our democracy and basic rights, finds just about 
            ALL of Judge Alito's record, writings, decisions and remarks 
            'unsettling.' We believe that this nomination and its threat to 
            privacy and autonomy and decency and respect for all of us is cause 
            for a declaration of 'extraordinary circumstances' and a Senate 
            filibuster."</P>
            <P>The Supreme Court's opinion in <EM><A 
            href="http://lists.now.org/t/283614/149703/1231792/0/">Ayotte v. 
            Planned Parenthood of Northern New England</A></EM> gives women's 
            rights supporters even greater reason to believe that Samuel Alito 
            is the wrong justice for a court whose mission is to preserve 
            fundamental constitutional rights and liberties. </P>
            <P>Gandy responded to that decision: "Yesterday the Supreme Court 
            sidestepped a substantive decision in Ayotte, yet we know that the 
            issue of abortion exceptions to preserve the woman's health will 
            come back to the Court. If Samuel Alito is on that Court, we have 
            every reason to believe that he will tip the balance against clear 
            protection for our lives and health. The looming threat of this 
            confirmation is terrifying." </P>
