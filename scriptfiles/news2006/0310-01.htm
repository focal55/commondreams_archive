<p>CURITIBA, Brazil - March 10 - The battle between the majority of 
developing countries and some of the world's biggest corporations will 
peak on March 13-17, 2006 in Brazil.

<p>United Nations talks on the global trade in genetically modified (GM), 
or biotech foods and crops will highlight the gap between countries 
demanding the right to regulate imports of GM products and the huge 
business interests that seek to benefit from weak rules.

<p>The identification and labeling of imports of GM products will be the 
key debate in Curitiba. (1) The biotech industries consistently opposed 
clear identification and labelling requirements for any of the GM crops 
on the market today. Without clear labelling many countries, especially 
developing countries with their limited resources, are unable to protect 
their food supply and environment from GM contamination.(2)

<p>Nnimmo Bassey, International Coordinator of the Friends of the Earth GM 
Campaign said:
" These talks are key to protecting the environment and the world's food 
supply from contamination from the biotech industry. Every country 
should have the right to know what is being imported and to decide if 
they want to eat genetically modified foods or not. African countries 
and other developing countries will not be the dumping ground for 
genetically modified crops that no one else wants."

<p>The UN Biosafety Protocol, which was originally agreed in January 2000, 
provides basic international rules that allow mainly developing 
countries to regulate the safety of GM foods, crops and seeds. It has 
been ratified by 132 countries but the three main countries that grow GM 
crops - the United States, Argentina and Canada - have refused to 
support it. Talks broke down in Montreal in June 2005 after Brazil and 
New Zealand blocked proposals that would have allowed the majority of 
developing countries to know if GM grains were being imported.

<p>Ten years after the first significant planting of GM crops, no plants 
with benefits to consumers or the environment have materialized and GM 
crops have failed to deliver the promises of the biotech industry. More 
than 80% of the area cultivated with biotech crops is still concentrated 
in only three countries: the US, Argentina and Canada. Friends of the 
Earth International recently published a report (3) that concluded:

<ul>
<li>

GM crops are not 'green'. Monsanto's GM soybeans, the most extensively 
grown GM crop today, has led to an increase in herbicide use. The 
intensive cultivation of soybeans in South America is fostering 
deforestation, and has been associated with a decline in soil fertility 
and soil erosion.
<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>GM crops do not tackle hunger or poverty. Most GM crops commercialized 
so far are destined for animal feed, not for food, and none have been 
introduced to address hunger and poverty issues. In Argentina, the 
second biggest producer of GM crops in the world, only 2% of the soya 
stays in the country. Other developing countries, such as Indonesia and 
India, have experienced substantial problems with Monsanto's GM crops, 
often leaving farmers heavily indebted. <br>
<br>
</li>
<li>The biotech industry has failed to introduce the promised 'new 
generation' of GM crops with consumer benefits. After 30 years of 
research, only two modifications have made it to the marketplace on any 
scale: insect resistance and herbicide tolerance. </li>
</ul>
