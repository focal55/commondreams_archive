<p>WASHINGTON - September 12 - Thousands of people across the nation marked the fifth anniversary of September 11 with calls for new and more productive ways to address global insecurity, the Friends Committee on National Legislation (Quakers) announced today. Participants in the 9/11 Call for Freedom from Fear from Alabama, Oklahoma, California, Indiana, Pennsylvania, and over a dozen other states organized prayer services, workshops, vigils, and meetings with their members of Congress to urge the U.S. government to reject the failed policies of the “war on terror” and develop new policies to protect the people of the United States. 

<p>"Today more violent groups are planning attacks on the U.S. than immediately after September 11, 2001, and curtailments of civil liberties are threatening the very democracy the nation has gone to war to protect,” said Robin Aura Kanegis, campaigns director of the Friends Committee on National Legislation. “The ‘war on terror’ isn’t working. We need to learn from the past five years and chart a new course based on building real security for the U.S. for the long term.”

<p>Participants in the 9/11 Call for Freedom From Fear events are calling on the U.S. government to end the conflict in Iraq, invest in development and diplomacy to build world stability and prevent future conflicts, and stop the erosion of constitutional rights and liberties that threaten the very roots of democracy here at home. The 9/11 Call for Freedom From Fear is endorsed by the National Council of Churches and many other national and regional groups and individuals. For a full listing go to www.fcnl.org/911call.

<p>Here are some of the reports on local activities:

<p>“There was a lot of energy,” said Madonna Kuciejczyk-Kernan after delivering a homily Sunday at Cronan Parish in St. Louis, Missouri, on Isaiah’s call to “be not afraid.” The Call for Freedom From Fear resonated in her community. “It was clear that lots of people felt a strong desire to live in that life.” 

<p>Andrea Miotto, of Clear Creek Friends Meeting, joined a delegation from Richmond, Indiana that met with the staff of Indiana Senators Lugar and Bayh. “We shared our concern that the choices we’ve made have led to decreased security and increased hatred of the U.S. around the world.” Members of the group who had traveled outside the country since 9/11 were troubled by the change in attitude they have experienced toward the U.S. “We’ve squandered the good will that the world had for us.”

<p>In Lansing, Michigan, Margaret Nielsen joined others in her community in urging her elected representatives to take steps toward Freedom From Fear. “Our local interfaith organization made visits to the local offices of our Representatives to address the disastrous war in Iraq, the toll on American lives and the toll on Iraqi’s lives, and the toll on our consciences.” The Greater Lansing Network Against War and Injustice, which began with leadership from Father Thelen of Cristo Rey Parish, brings together people from many faiths and other non-faith organizations and has been spreading the 9/11 Call for Freedom from Fear. “There’s a lot of us,” said Nielson.

<p>The vision advocated around the country today rejects the politics of fear and calls us to build a world of peace and security. Advocates say the U.S. could work on preventing the next wars now by expanding international development and diplomacy, and should stop the erosion of constitutional rights in the name of “security.”
