<p>NEW YORK  - July 31 - 
The 2006 Change Wal-Mart, Change America national bus tour will officially launch its non-stop cross-country campaign in New York City on August 1ST. WakeUpWalMart.com, America's campaign to change Wal-Mart, is embarking on a non-stop tour hitting 19 states, 35 cities, in 35 days.

<p>The star of the "2006 Change Wal-Mart, Change America" tour is a 45-foot long bus (more like an enormous billboard) nicknamed "Smiley." The bus will be wrapped side-to-side and front-to-back in a patriotic American flag emblazoned with the group's website, WakeUpWalMart.com, and the name of the tour, "2006 Change Wal- Mart, Change America Tour." In addition, on each side of the bus, the central messages of the tour will be highlighted for all to see - including "Join America's Fight for Health Care," "Join America's Fight for Good Jobs" and "Join the Fight for a Better America."

<p>As part of the first day's activities, WakeUpWalMart.com and "Smiley" will canvass Times Square beginning at 8:30am and Union Square beginning at 10:30am.

<p>Following the street canvass, the campaign will hold an early evening "Better NYC, Better America" community meeting in the Bronx at the CHURCH OF OUR LADY OF REFUGE, 290 EAST 196TH STREET. The "Better America" meeting will be led by members of New York City's clergy, the Reverend Markel Hutchins, Jim Dean, Chair of Democracy for America and WakeUpWalMart.com
