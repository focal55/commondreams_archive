<p>WASHINGTON - March 21 - Saving endangered  species like pandas, gorillas and tigers helps reduce poverty and  improve the lives of local communities, according to a new World  Wildlife Fund report. Now as the eighth Conference of the Parties  to the Convention on Biological Diversity opens in Curitiba,  Brazil, WWF urges the CBD and member governments to integrate  species conservation work into efforts to alleviate poverty.</p>
<p>   "Now's the time to recognize the strong connections between  sustainable economic development, a healthy environment, and  successful species conservation," said Ginette Hemley, vice  president for species conservation, World Wildlife Fund. "WWF's  new report provides clear evidence that when endangered species  benefit, people also benefit."</p>
<p>   By examining six projects in Africa, Latin America and Asia,  the new report shows that WWF's work to save endangered wildlife  helps eradicate poverty and hunger, as well as promote  sustainable and fair development in rural areas.</p>
<p>   "Problems that threaten species like the destruction of  habitats and natural resources often contribute to poverty," said  Hemley.</p>
<p>   Conservation and sustainable management of species and their  habitats means better protection of forest, freshwater and marine  habitats. As a result, the rural poor who depend on these areas  have more access to the goods and services they provide. Incomes  increase and access to freshwater, health, education and women's  rights often also improve.</p>
<p>   According to the report, some ecotourism projects based on the  observation of species in the wild-such as marine turtles, pandas  and mountain gorillas-generate significant amounts of money for  communities. Applying knowledge of species movements in and  across habitats can help implement such sustainable land-use  planning.</p>
<p>   For example, in Tortuguero, Costa Rica, live turtles are worth  more to the local economy than turtle meat and eggs ever were.  The community strongly supports conservation measures to promote  ecotourism, and both turtle and tourist numbers have climbed over  the past 30 years.</p>
<p>   Community forestry efforts in parts of Nepal have led to the  restoration of vital habitat corridors for the survival of tiger  populations living there. WWF is helping local people to manage  and directly benefit from these forest resources. According to  the report, groups of community forest users can earn $4,760  annually in a nation where the per capita income is roughly $250.</p>
<p>   In the Indian village of Farida, a WWF awareness-raising  program aimed at conserving the rare Ganges river dolphin helped  the community to address critical basic needs such as clean  water. After five years, the number of families below the poverty  line significantly declined.</p>
<p>   The report further shows that more than 60 percent of people  living around Uganda's Bwindi Impenetrable National Park, which  protects the habitat of the endangered mountain gorilla, feel  they benefit economically and socially from the forests. Other  examples show that, in China, illegal and damaging activities in  forested panda reserves declined when communities gained  alternative sources of income, such as farming and animal  husbandries supported by WWF. In Namibia, the creation of  conservancies, where communities are jointly managing their  wildlife resources, has resulted in better wildlife management,  increased wildlife populations, ecotourism development and  increased profits in community-owned enterprises.</p>

<p>   World Wildlife Fund is the largest conservation organization  in the world. For 45 years, WWF has worked to save endangered  species, protect endangered habitats, and address global threats  such as deforestation, overfishing, and climate change. Known  worldwide by its panda logo, WWF works in 100 countries on more  than 2,000 conservation programs. WWF has 1.2 million members in  the United States and nearly 5 million supporters worldwide.

<p>   NOTES TO EDITORS:</p>

<p>   2. The study shows that WWF species conservation field  projects deliver on four of the eight UN Millennium Development  Goals:</p>
<p>   -- Goal 1: Eradicate extreme poverty and hunger</p>
<p>   -- Goal 3: Promote gender equality and empower women</p>
<p>   -- Goal 7: Ensure environmental sustainability</p>
<p>   -- Goal 8: Develop a global partnership for development</p>
<p>   3. The six case studies included in this report were taken  from around the world to represent WWF's species conservation  work globally, and to begin to quantify the contribution of  species conservation to the MDGs. The report is based on new  research and analysis using the Sustainable Livelihoods (SL)  framework to assess field data and is supported by wide  literature review.</p>
<p>   The selected case studies are:</p>
<p>   -- Integrating sustainable livelihoods with tiger conservation  in the Terai Arc Landscape, Nepal</p>
<p>   -- Wildlife Conservation - a viable strategy in Namibia's  Rural Development Programme</p>
<p>   The National Community Based Natural Resource Management  (CBNRM) Programme in Namibia is a joint venture between  government, non-governmental agencies and local communities that  operates under a collaborative framework of the Namibian  Association of CBNRM Support Organisations (NACSO).</p>
<p>   -- Mountain Gorilla conservation contributes to local  livelihoods around the Bwindi Impenetrable National Park, Uganda</p>
<p>   The International Gorilla Conservation Programme (IGCP) is a  collaboration of WWF, African Wildlife Foundation and Fauna and  Flora International.</p>
<p>   -- Partnering to secure the future for people and pandas in  the Minshan and Qinling Mountains, China</p>
<p>   -- Sea Turtle Conservation in Tortuguero, Costa Rica</p>
<p>   WWF's partner, the Caribbean Conservation Corporation (CCC)  has undertaken sea turtle research and conservation efforts in  Tortuguero since 1959.
