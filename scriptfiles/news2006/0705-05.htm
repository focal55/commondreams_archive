<p>LOS ANGELES - July 5 - This morning shortly before 7:00am, bulldozers were unloaded on site at the Farm and began to destroy the 14-acre farm.  They are on site right now with LAPD escorts.  Dozens of supporters are at the Farm and on route to the Farm to hopefully prevent the eradication of the site.
 
<p>On June 13, 2006 the City of Los Angeles witnessed and participated in the early morning raid to evict the South Central Farmers and their supporters who had set up an encampment taking a principled stand.  Following the eviction, a 24 hour vigil was set up and has been held with dozens of supporters and farmers being present nightly.  The community has remained together keeping strong after the shock of being evicted from the Farm.
 
<p>This morning’s attack on the Farm seems callous as efforts to negotiate a deal with developer Raph Horowitz had been continuing.  However he has not been receptive.  Tezozomoc, a spokesperson for the South Central Farmers stated, “We feel this is an act of aggression and is another blow to a community that is already suffering.  The Farmers have been watching their crops die for the past few weeks as we have been trying to bring Horowitz to the negotiating table, again.  He has refused mediation.   This is pushing the knife in further into the heart of Los Angeles and especially this impoverished community in South Central.”
                          
<p>On July 12, 2006 the South Central Farmers’ lawsuit that was initially filed in 2003 against the City of Los Angeles and Ralph Horowitz to review the integrity of the sale of the 14 acre site is scheduled to be heard.  The bulldozing of the Farm this morning is a destructive and oppressive act against a community who have been walking with hope that something can positive could have still been resolved in fairness to Mr. Horowitz and the community around the Farm.
 
<p>People are encourage to call Jan Perry (213)-473-7009 or email <a href="mailto:councilmember.perry@lacityorg">councilmember.perry@lacityorg</a><p>She has the power to stop Horowitz and we must pressure her to do it.
