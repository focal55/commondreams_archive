<p>NEW YORK - March 7 - Today, the Brennan Center  for Justice at NYU School of Law released new research suggesting  that improper implementation of statewide voter registration  databases required under the Help America Vote Act (HAVA) could  result in millions of eligible voters being denied access to the  rolls.  </p>
<p>   The report, &quot;Making the List: Database Matching and  Verification Processes for Voter Registration,&quot; is the first  extensive national survey of current state practices relating to  the implementation of statewide voter registration databases  required by 2006 under HAVA.</p>

<p>   &quot;HAVA was meant to ensure that voter registration rolls are  accurate and that all eligible citizens are able to cast their  vote,&quot; said Deborah Goldberg, director of the Brennan Center's  Democracy Program. &quot;Unfortunately, this report makes clear that  poor implementation of HAVA's database requirement has the  potential to disenfranchise millions of Americans.&quot;</p>
<p>   The Brennan Center found that the practice of using Department  of Motor Vehicles (DMV) and Social Security Administration  databases to verify information on voter registration forms could  create unwarranted hurdles to registration and, in at least seven  states, could result in 20 percent of eligible voters being  incorrectly left off the rolls.</p>
<p>   &quot;Databases compiled at different times and for different  purposes record information differently: 'William' may not match  'Will' or 'Billy' and a maiden name may not match a married name.  Given that, a 'no-match, no-vote' policy would be a disaster for  voters,&quot; stated Wendy Weiser, Deputy Director of the Brennan  Center's Democracy Program and one of the report's authors.</p>
<p>   In 2004 the New York City Board of Elections conducted an  experiment to audit their voter rolls using match criteria  similar to that being considered in states across the country.  The Board of Elections attempted to match 15,000 new voter  registration records against those in the state motor vehicle  database. 1 out of 5 records failed to match solely because of  typos by election officials.</p>

<p>   &quot;The lesson from New York City's audit is that a strictly  applied no-match, no-vote policy would disenfranchise an  astounding percentage of voters,&quot; stated Brennan Center attorney  Justin Levitt, one of the report's authors.</p>
<p>   The Brennan Center report found that seven states in  particular -- Iowa, Maryland, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Texas,  Virginia and Washington -- are set to implement database matching  policies that could create severe barriers to the right to vote. </p>
<p>   &quot;Each of these states is on a collision course that could  result in chaos at the polls in November as millions of eligible  voters find they are unable to cast their ballot,&quot; stated Levitt.</p>
<p>   Policy Proposals that Protect Voters</p>
<p>   The Brennan Center report contains concrete proposals to help  states implement the law so that all eligible voters &quot;make the  list&quot;.  The report recommends that states enact: </p>

<p>   -- policies that account for the wide variety of common  database matching errors and ensure that the match process will  not bar registration of an eligible voter;</p>
<p>   -- guidelines for matching voter information to other  government databases, with built-in flexibility and ample  opportunity to correct mistakes that arise</p>
<p>   -- standards for clarifying registration forms, for ensuring  accurate data entry from the forms into registration databases  and for keeping database information updated</p>
<p>   -- clear, transparent and voter-protective procedures for  database maintenance and purging.</p>
<p>   Several states have already adopted or are considering  adopting many of the Brennan Center's guidelines to protect  voters from being dropped from the rolls.  The report singled out  Nebraska, New Jersey and Oregon as the leaders in efforts to  enact HAVA's database provisions in ways true to their intent.</p>
<p>   &quot;Thankfully, most states have not formalized their policies  around voter databases.  Hopefully this report will cause state  lawmakers to realize just what's at stake here and spur them to  adopt sane database policies that protect Americans' right to  vote&quot; stated Goldberg.</p>

<p>   A full copy of the report is available on the Brennan Center's  Web site at  <a href="http://releases.usnewswire.com/redir.asp?ReleaseID=61923&Link=http://www.brennancenter.org/programs/downloads/HAVA/svrd/SVRD%20matching%20report.pdf">http://www.brennancenter.org/programs/downloads/HAVA/svrd/SVRD%20matching%20report.pdf</a>.</p>
