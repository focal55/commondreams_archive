<p>PARIS - January 6 - Today the Indian Supreme Court 
Monitoring Committee (SCMC) branded the French naval aircraft carrier, 
the Clemenceau, which is being towed to India for scrapping, as an 
illegal transport due to the hazardous materials, including 500 tonnes 
of asbestos, on board. Greenpeace demanded that the French Government 
take back its ship and for India formally reject its entry into Indian 
Territory.

<p>The ship left France on December 31, 2005, under a huge cloud of 
controversy after Greenpeace and local NGOs attempted to stop the 
journey through protest and the French courts. At that time the SCMC 
said they had no objection to the ship's scrapping in India, subject to 
certain conditions, including an independent audit to confirm that the 
ship had been decontaminated by France.

<p>Since the French Government has failed to fulfil these conditions, this 
afternoon the Indian authority issued a statement declaring that the 
Basel Convention was being violated and that  French authorities had not 
been honest in regard to the potential hazards on board and that the 
ship must not enter India's Economic Exclusion Zone (EEZ) (1).

<p>"The French Government must now accept that the concerns around the 
Clemenceau are real and valid. India has spoken - the ship and its 
lethal load are not welcome. The Clemenceau is being towed as we speak, 
it must stop its journey immediately and be returned to France," said 
Pascal Husting, Executive Director of Greenpeace France. "The Indian 
Government must withdraw its permission and publicly reject this ship's 
entry into India."

<p>Officials from Technopure, the company contracted by the French 
Government to decontaminating the ship before it was dispatched to 
India, has gone on public record to confirm that the Clemenceau contains 
as much as 500 tonnes of asbestos, a huge increase on the 45 to 50 
tonnes that the French Government has admitted to. The company ended its 
contract with the French Government and disclosed this information on 
moral grounds, despite the confidentiality clause they were bound to. 
Technopure officials declared that France never intended to undertake 
more than a superficial clean-up of visible toxic substances on board 
the Clemenceau and deliberately chose the cheapest option they could get 
away with, despite the knowledge that the wastes on board would result 
in disease and death for Indian workers and devastation for the Indian 
environment.

<p>"The Clemenceau is symbolic of the wider global issue of developed 
countries dumping waste they consider too toxic to deal with at home 
onto developing countries. Governments must not be allowed to think that 
their responsibilities end when these hazardous wastes leave their 
shores," said Ramapati Kumar, Toxics Campaigner, Greenpeace India. 
"Governments must be stopped from playing 'Pass the toxic parcel'."

<p>The Clemenceau may be one of the largest ships to be sent for scrap but 
every year a vast decrepit armada bearing a dangerous cargo of toxic 
substances including asbestos, PCBs (polychlorinated biphenyls) and 
heavy metals, ends up in Asian ship breaking yards (Bangladesh, India, 
China and Pakistan) where they are cut up in the crudest of fashions 
taking a huge toll on human health and the local environment.
