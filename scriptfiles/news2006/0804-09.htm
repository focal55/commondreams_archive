<p>LONDON - August 4 - <B><br>
Assistance provided for medical facilities </B><BR>
In the last few days, ICRC health teams have delivered vital medical supplies for the treatment of war-wounded and chronically ill persons in Marjayoun and Jezzine. The hospital in Marjayoun received injection materials, dressings, dialysis supplies, catheters, surgical gloves, antibiotics and drugs for surgery and anaesthesia. The hospital in Jezzine (east of Sidon) received disinfectants, injection materials and dressings. The dispensary run by the Lebanese Red Cross Society in the same town, which generally treats chronic cases, was supplied with drugs for cardiovascular diseases, diabetes and other illnesses. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Delivery of fuel and food aid </B><BR>
On 2 August, a team proceeding from Tyre supplied 9,000 litres of fuel for the running of essential civilian infrastructure, namely the hospital in Tibnin (south-east of Tyre), the Lebanese Red Cross dispensary in the same town and water pumps in Tibnin and the surrounding villages of Kafra, Aita Jebel, Kaddata and Tiri. Water is one of the foremost concerns of people in the villages that the ICRC has been able to reach in the past few weeks.<BR>
<BR>
The same team distributed 6,634 ready-to-eat meals and 125 blankets in the same villages and another team distributed 650 family food parcels to displaced persons in Tyre.<BR>
