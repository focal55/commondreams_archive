<p>WASHINGTON - July 10 - Sarah Stephens,  director of the Freedom to Travel Campaign, released the  following statement regarding the second report of the Bush  Commission for Assistance to a Free Cuba:</p>
<p>   &quot;There are three things wrong with the Bush Commission's plan  -- the Cuban people don't want it, it can't work, and the timing  couldn't be worse, arriving at a time when Latin Americans are  fiercely resisting efforts by the United States to dictate their  future for them.</p>
<p>   &quot;U.S. sanctions defeat our ability to influence Cuba's  economic system or human rights, and the Cuban government uses  these regime change reports to discredit the United States in  Cuba and around the world,&quot; Stephens said. &quot;It's a horribly  misguided and ineffective policy. It would be much for effective  for us to engage and trade with Cuba, and we should start by  restoring the rights of Americans to travel to the island,&quot;  Stephens said.</p>
<p>   &quot;The report refers to the so-called 'information blockade.'  The real information blockade is enforced by George Bush, who  stops Cuban families from visiting their relatives in Cuba, who  stops religious institutions from engaging in their ministry on  Cuba, and who stops America's goodwill ambassadors, our people  and our businesses, from traveling to Cuba and engaging in  commerce with Cuba.&quot;</p>
<p>   Stephens also highlighted the increasing futility of American  economic sanctions saying, &quot;In a globalized economy, unilateral  sanctions inevitably fail. With subsidized Venezuelan oil,  credits from China, and a healthy tourism industry, Cuba doesn't  need relations with the U.S. to explore for oil or reinvest in  its economy.&quot;</p>
<p>   -----</p>
<p>   The Freedom to Travel Campaign is a public education effort  that supports reform of U.S. policy toward Cuba, starting with  repeal of the ban on legal travel by Americans to Cuba.</p>
