<p>NEW YORK - December 14 - Today
United for Peace and Justice announced plans to march for an end to the
occupation of Iraq in Washington, D.C. 
<p>Leslie Cagan, National Coordinator of UFPJ, said, "On
Election Day the voters delivered a dramatic, unmistakable mandate for peace.
Now it's time for action. As the new Congress gets underway, <b>on Saturday, January 27</b>, we will converge
from all around the country in Washington, D.C., to send
a strong, clear message to Congress and the Bush Administration: <b>The People Have Spoken, Now Congress Must
Act. End the War in </b><b>Iraq</b><b> - Bring the Troops Home Now!"</b></p>

<p>United
for Peace and Justice is working to bring people from every congressional
district in the country to gather to express support for those members of
Congress who are prepared to take immediate action against the war; to pressure
those who are hesitant to act; and to speak out against those who remain tied
to a failed policy.<br><br><b>WHAT: </b><br>
Nonviolent mass march on Washington to call
on the new Congress to move quickly to implement the voters' mandate for peace.
