<p>WASHINGTON - September 7 - Reform groups sent a  letter today challenging members of Congress on their failure to  deal with the corruption scandals in this Congress and calling on  members to make a commitment to fight for the lobbying and ethics  reforms that are essential to restoring the integrity of  Congress.</p>
<p>   The groups include the Campaign Legal Center, Common Cause,  Democracy 21, the League of Women Voters, Public Citizen and U.S.  PIRG.</p>
<p>   According to the letter sent today by the reform groups to  House members, &quot;As we head into the final weeks of the 109th  Congress, this Congress has done nothing to address the worst  congressional corruption scandals in decades. Congress has  enacted no reforms to address the ethics, lobbying and influence- money scandals that have been a hallmark of the 109th Congress.&quot;</p>
<p>   A similar letter was sent to all senators.</p>
<p>   The letter to House members continues, &quot;As of today, one  former member of the House in this Congress sits in jail  convicted of bribery; a second House Member is under criminal  investigation for potential bribery, having been found with  $90,000 in cash in his freezer; a third House Member, who has  resigned, is under indictment for criminal campaign finance  violations and is a central figure in the Jack Abramoff lobbying  scandals; and a fourth House Member, who has also resigned, is  another key player in the Abramoff scandals and reportedly is  under criminal investigation for participating in corrupt  activities.&quot;</p>
<p>   The letter states, &quot;In addition, as of today, the Justice  Department is conducting a criminal corruption investigation into  the Abramoff lobbying scandals in Congress, with several  additional members of Congress reportedly also under  investigation for their activities in connection with Abramoff.  Another criminal corruption investigation is being conducted in  the aftermath of the Cunningham bribery conviction that  reportedly may involve other House Members and their roles in  earmarking federal funds for private interests; and yet another  investigation of a House Member reportedly is being conducted by  the FBI in connection with the Member's real estate interests,  nonprofit groups he founded and federal earmarks he provided to  the nonprofits.&quot;</p>
<p>   According to the letter, &quot;There are no new laws and no new  congressional ethics rules to deal with the campaign  contributions that influence-seekers provide for members of  Congress, the domestic and foreign vacation-type trips they pay  for, the company planes they provide at bargain rates, including  for campaign fundraising trips, and the numerous other financial  favors and perks they make available to Members.&quot;</p>
<p>    The letter continues, &quot;Furthermore, the lobbying and ethics  legislation passed by the House and Senate, and purportedly  waiting to go to conference, is not expected to produce  meaningful lobbying and ethics reforms, even if a conference  agreement is reached.&quot;</p>
<p>   The letter adds, &quot;There are reports that the House and/or  Senate may enact some earmark reforms in September. This,  however, does not address the fundamental problems that exist  with the lobbying laws and congressional ethics rules. These  critical issues must be dealt with to address the widespread  corruption problems that have been revealed in this Congress.&quot;</p>
<p>   According to the letter from the reform groups, &quot;The failure  of Congress to respond in any real way to the congressional  corruption scandals is a national disgrace.&quot;</p>
<p>   The letter states, &quot;While there have been serious lobbying and  ethics reform bills introduced in the House in this Congress,  such as H.R.5677, introduced by Representatives Christopher Shays  (R-CT) and Marty Meehan (D-MA), none of these reform bills has  been passed by the House.&quot;</p>
<p>   The letter adds, &quot;We deplore the failure of this Congress to  take any meaningful steps to deal with the extraordinary  congressional corruption scandals that have occurred.&quot;</p>
<p>   According to the letter, &quot;We are committed to continuing to  fight a major battle in this Congress, and the next Congress, to  enact the fundamental lobbying and ethics reforms that are  essential to restoring the health and integrity of our democracy  and of the House as an institution.&quot;</p>
<p>   The letter states, &quot;We believe it is time for members of  Congress to make this commitment as well.&quot;</p>
