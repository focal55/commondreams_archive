<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON - February 13 - On February 6, 2006,
President Bush submitted his budget for FY 2007 to Congress and the American
people. As in past years, the president has used his budget to shortchange key
conservation programs through funding cuts and budgetary gimmicks, seriously
jeopardizing our wildlife and public lands. The president's budget would cut
funding for natural resources and the environment by 13% below FY 2006. The
total that the president has allocated for this important line item is $28.7
billion, just 1 percent of the massive $2.8 trillion federal budget. This
represents a cut of $4.3 billion, or 13 percent, below 2006 funding levels.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The FY 2007 budget is nothing short of a disaster
for our nation's wildlife and habitat and falls far short of recommendations
made in the FY 2007 Green Budget released by fifteen environmental groups. For
the few programs where modest increases were provided, they are still far below
the need, are outstripped by cuts to other programs, and in most cases do not
keep pace with fixed costs.&nbsp;</font></p>

              mask the true impacts. The LWCF, established in 1964, is one of
              the greatest tools we have to address the increasingly significant
              loss of open space, forests and wildlife habitat by providing
