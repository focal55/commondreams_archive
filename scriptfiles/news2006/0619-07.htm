<p>PIERRE, South Dakota - June 19 - South Dakota  Secretary of State Chris Nelson certified today that South  Dakotans will have the opportunity in November to repeal the  state's outrageous abortion ban. </p>
<p>   NARAL Pro-Choice South Dakota, working in partnership with the  Campaign for Healthy Families, provided financial and volunteer  support for a signature-collection effort that delivered more  than 38,000 signatures to the secretary of state's office late  last month.</p>
<p>   &quot;We are proud that South Dakotans now will have the  opportunity to stand up to this attack on women's freedom and  privacy and vote to repeal the abortion ban,&quot; said Thelma  Underberg, executive director of NARAL Pro-Choice South  Dakota. &quot;We are hearing from people who want to help us as this  campaign moves into the next phase. From now until November, we  will work to mobilize the pro-choice majority to prevent  politicians from interfering in our most private medical  decisions.&quot;  </p>

<p>   Under South Dakota law, the campaign had to gather 16,728  signatures from registered voters to refer the state abortion ban  to the November ballot.</p>
