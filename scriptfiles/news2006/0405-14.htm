<p>WASHINGTON - April 5 - Neil Watkins, National Coordinator 
of the Jubilee USA Network, reacted today to the 
conclusion of the annual meetings of the 
Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) in Brazil:

<p>"Bolivian leader Evo Morales and other Latin 
American leaders and civil society groups raised 
strong calls for debt cancellation for 
impoverished nations in the IDB meetings which 
ended today. But the meeting ended without concrete action.

<p>"While we welcome the creation of a committee at 
the IDB to discuss concrete proposals to move 
forward this important discussion, this must lead 
to debt cancellation delivered in weeks, rather 
than months or years. It is time for US and Latin 
American governments who own the IDB to move from 
words to action; debt payments are costing lives across the continent.

<p>"We reiterate our call today for the immediate 
debt cancellation for impoverished countries in 
Latin America and the Caribbean where debt is 
odious or impedes human development and progress 
towards the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). 
As a first step towards this goal we call on the 
Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) to 
immediately and without further conditions, 
cancel the debts held by Bolivia, Guyana, Haiti, 
Honduras and Nicaragua to the IDB.

<p>"With the debate over immigration now raging in 
the United States, it is important to note that 
crushing debts and unjust economic policies are 
key underlying policies that lead people to seek 
livelihoods in the United States. Definitive 
cancellation of Latin American debts and an end 
to unjust economic policies would help to relieve 
immigration pressures and create more social 
equity throughout the region, benefiting us all."

<p>Jubilee USA Network is the US arm of the 
international movement working for debt 
cancellation for impoverished nations. Jubilee 
USA is a network of 75 religious denominations 
and faith-based groups, labor groups, 
environmental organizations, and community and 
advocacy groups working for freedom from debt and 
economic justice for countries in Africa, Asia, and Latin America.
