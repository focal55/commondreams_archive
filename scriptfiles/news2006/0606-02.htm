<p>Virtually every state will lose funding for homeland security, according to a new publication by the National Priorities Project, which breaks down each state's cut and shows how states would gain under an alternative national security budget.  The publication released today, <a href="http://www.nationalpriorities.org/bettersecuritypr" target="_new">Better Security for Less Money</a>, is available by state.   

   <p> The National Priorities Project (NPP), a non-profit, non-partisan organization, presents an overview of how the Unified Security Budget, a proposal by security experts, would increase national security and save tax dollars by shifting money from unnecessary weaponry to preventive measures and homeland security.  NPP provides the share of savings for each state and shows what that money could buy each state in public school teachers, health care coverage for uninsured residents, affordable housing units and job creation.   These numbers, along with the updated cost of war for each state, are available at <a href="http://www.nationalpriorities.org/bettersecuritypr" target="_blank">Better Security for Less Money</a>. 

   <p>"Our federal government proposes to spend half a trillion dollars on our national security while it cuts homeland security to almost every state," said Greg Speeter, executive director of the National Priorities Project.  "Our leaders need to guard our security and our tax dollars by adopting a new security budget that is entirely possible and necessary."

   <p> The Unified Security Budget, written by Lawrence Korb of the Center for Defense Information and Miriam Pemberton of Foreign Policy in Focus, presents a broad view of national security concerns and offers an alternative security budget that cuts unnecessary weaponry.   It breaks down current national security priorities, showing how military spending currently receives 83% of all security dollars, while homeland security receives 11% and preventive measures 6%.  Further information is available at The Unifed Security Budget.
