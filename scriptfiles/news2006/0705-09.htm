<p> WASHINGTON - July 5 - 


Food & Water Watch today released the names of chicken producers who failed to meet federal standards for Salmonella between 1998 and 2005.  The names have never been publicly released by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the agency responsible for meat and poultry inspection.  The consumer group’s analysis of the USDA’s Salmonella testing program provides direct evidence of the danger posed by a change to the program that would reduce the frequency of testing at some plants. 

<p>The report lists 106 broiler chicken plants in 27 states and Puerto Rico that failed at least one Salmonella testing period, grouped by company name so consumers can consult it as they shop.  The agency weakened its protection of consumers last week, when it released a notice that delays testing at plants that met Salmonella standards in the past.  Had this new policy been in effect from 1998 through 2005, up to 22 of the 106 plants would not have been tested and found to be in violation.     

<p>To date, USDA has never publicly released information on which plants failed to meet Salmonella standards, despite an announcement that it would consider doing so as a way to increase incentives for better industry performance. 

<p>The testing results, which were obtained through the Freedom of Information Act, are from the USDA’s routine sampling program for Salmonella. The testing program is touted by the government as an indicator of the effectiveness of meat companies’ food safety procedures.

<p>“It should not be left to non-profit groups to let consumers know which companies failed to meet government food safety standards,” said Wenonah Hauter, executive director of Food & Water Watch.  “If USDA is going to live up to its rhetoric, they need to routinely test all plants and disclose the results.”

<p>In light of these findings, Food & Water Watch recommends that the USDA seek legislation to make microbial testing performance standards enforceable, publish on its website the results of Salmonella testing for every plant, and abandon a proposal to reduce the frequency of testing at plants that had passed two previous testing periods.

<p>In 1996, the federal government instituted major changes in the meat inspection system by creating the Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) system. Under HACCP, meat plants are responsible for determining where hazards are most likely to occur in their system and controlling them. Government inspectors shifted to an auditing role, and have less authority to require corrective action when they see a problem. As part of HACCP, the government launched its Salmonella testing program.

<p>During a testing period, the USDA is supposed to take samples during 51 consecutive days of broiler chicken production. If a plant has more than 12 samples test positive for Salmonella during that period, they fail to meet the standard.
