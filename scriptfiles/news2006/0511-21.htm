<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->SAN FRANCISCO / WASHINGTON - May 11 - This weekend, on May 13-14, 2006, celebrities, peace activists, mothers and families will gather in front of the White House from 3pm on Saturday until 3pm on Sunday to call for an end to the war in Iraq and stand against a military attack on Iran. Actress Susan Sarandon, Gold Star mother Cindy Sheehan, Reverend Yearwood of the Hip Hop Caucus, journalist Randi Rhodes, singer/songwriter Jill Sobule, labor leader Dolores Huerta, and doctor/clown Patch Adams are among the hundreds who will participate.
 
<p>Citing the original Mother’s Day Proclamation by Julia Ward Howe, the organizers say that the holiday historically calls for women to act against war.  Written in 1870, Howe’s statement urges women to rise up with a call to “Disarm! Disarm!” and find “the means whereby the great human family can live in peace.” 
 
<p>“I don’t want any more moms to grieve for a child lost in this unjust, unnecessary war in Iraq,” says Gold Star mother Cindy Sheehan. “This Mothers Day we’ll be outside the White House all day and all night demanding that our children come home from Iraq and not be sent to another reckless war in Iran.” 
 
<p>The weekend plans include an evening concert, film screenings, workshops on legislative strategies, writing letters to Laura Bush, a pink pajama party, an interfaith service on Sunday morning, and a visit to Walter Reed Hospital to deliver roses to mothers/wives of injured soldiers. 
 
<p>“The original intent of Mother’s Day was not to give your mom chocolates or breakfast in bed, but for mothers to join together to stop war,” says Medea Benjamin of CODEPINK: Women for Peace, the group organizing the event. “With the war raging in Iraq and another war looming in Iran, we invite mothers all over this country to join us in demanding a peaceful world for ourselves and our children.”
 
<p>The vigil is emblematic of shifting sentiments against the war.  Six in ten Americans now consider the war in Iraq a mistake.  Furthermore, 72% of deployed troops and 62% of American women favor a full withdrawal of troops before the end of 2006, according to a Zogby poll of February 2006 and a Gallup poll of December 2005, respectively.
 
<p>Susan Sarandon will be present from 1-4pm on Sunday, when organizers plan a dramatic action.
