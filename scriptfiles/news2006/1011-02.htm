<p>WASHINGTON - October 11 - Regarding today’s Conference on School Safety convened by the White House in response to unrelenting firearms violence in America’s schools, Violence Policy Center Legislative Director Kristen Rand released the following statement:

 

<p>“The fact that guns are not on today’s agenda only confirms what was already obvious:  The Bush Administration is in complete denial regarding the catalytic role that guns play in school violence.  How is it even possible to have a discussion about preventing school shootings without talking about guns?

 

<p>Other industrialized nations–such as Great Britain–that have experienced horrific school shootings have honed in on the availability of guns and implemented meaningful gun control policies.  Those policies have worked to stop school shootings.  But the Bush Administration continues to allow the gun lobby to extract its ‘price of freedom’ for unfettered access to firearms:  an endless string of bloody school shootings.  Today’s conference will, unfortunately, do little to prevent more violence.”
