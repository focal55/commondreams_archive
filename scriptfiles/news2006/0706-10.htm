<p>WASHINGTON   - July 6 - Last year, leaders of the world's economic powers 
proclaimed that 2005 would be the "year for Africa" and gathered at the 
annual Group of 8 (G8) meetings to create a plan to address the 
continent's challenges. Debt cancellation figured prominently on the 
agenda, and the G8 leaders crafted a deal to cancel 100% of the debts 
owed by 18 countries - 14 in Africa - to the World Bank and 
International Monetary Fund (IMF).

<p>This Africa Action statement examines the current reality in Africa's 
debt crisis and investigates the results of last year's promises. As the 
G8 leaders prepare to convene in St. Petersburg, Russia, it is clear 
that Africa's debt crisis is far from resolved, and there is an urgent 
need for new action from the G8 on this critical priority.


<p><b>The Outcome of the G8 Promises</b>

<p>Last year's G8 deal promising to cancel $40 billion in debt owed by 
developing countries was met with global acclaim. This deal was the 
result of years of activism on the part of civil society in Africa and 
throughout the Global South, supported by activists across the U.S. and 
beyond. However, this agreement marked only an initial victory on the 
path to debt cancellation for Africa, as the past year has made clear.

<p>Once the spotlight dimmed after the G8 meetings in Gleneagles, the World 
Bank and IMF initially made attempts to renege on the debt cancellation 
commitments, arguing over details of eligibility and seeking to insert 
further economic conditions. In addition, Mauritania was dropped from 
the deal, due to a dispute over its governing practices. After new 
pressure from activists and others, the IMF finally carried out its debt 
cancellation in January 2006, releasing $3.3 billion. The World Bank 
followed suit this week, on July 1, 2006.

<p>Despite claims of "100% multilateral debt relief," the G8 deal does not 
apply to all countries in need of cancellation, nor does it cancel 100% 
of the debt for any one country. The 14 African countries considered 
eligible under the G8 deal - Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Ethiopia, 
Ghana, Madagascar, Mali, Mozambique, Niger, Rwanda, Senegal, Tanzania, 
Uganda, and Zambia - represent only about one-quarter of Africa's 54 
countries and a small portion of the African nations in critical need of 
debt cancellation.

<p>A number of the selected African countries have had significant 
fractions of their debt cancelled. For example, Uganda will have 79% of 
its debt cancelled, and for Mozambique the proportion is 48%. But there 
are dozens of other nations that still require debt cancellation to meet 
their development goals.

<p>The handful of countries that were eligible for debt cancellation under 
the G8 deal must all meet harmful economic conditions established by the 
Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative. HIPC terms, such as 
the forced privatization of public enterprises and the implementation of 
unfair trade regulations, undermine the ability of African governments 
to look after the welfare for their populations. Only once these 
stipulations had been carried out to the satisfaction of the World Bank 
and IMF, however, would the countries be said to have reached their 
"completion point" qualifying them for debt cancellation.

<p>Nigeria, with its $30 billion debt burden, was one of the many African 
countries considered ineligible for inclusion in the G8 deal. Nigeria's 
debt was largely incurred during the military and dictatorial regime of 
Sani Abacha, and the borrowed funds provided little benefit for the 
Nigerian people. In a separate deal reached last year with members of 
the Paris Club of major world creditors, which did not recognize the 
odious nature of the debt, $18 billion of Nigeria's debt was written 
off. In exchange, Nigeria agreed to make a payment of $12 billion. This 
substantial sum siphoned money away from other more pressing domestic 
concerns, such as addressing extreme poverty in the country.

<p>One year after the G8 announcement of a debt deal, Africa's debt crisis 
is far from over. While initial debt cancellation for an initial list of 
countries has freed up some funds that will make a difference in 
alleviating poverty, improving health systems, and attaining other 
development goals, Africa's debt crisis persists and demands new action 
from G8 creditors.


<p><b>What Remains to be Done</b>

<p>In the past, the benefits of debt cancellation have been plainly 
demonstrated. In Burundi, elimination of school fees in 2005 allowed an 
additional 300,000 children to enroll. In Mozambique, debt relief 
allowed the government to provide free immunization to all children.
<p>Culminating with IMF debt cancellation in January 2006, Zambia's debt 
burden was reduced from $7.1 billion to $500 million. This drastic 
change allowed the government to grant free basic healthcare to its 
population, a major step in countering health threats such as HIV/AIDS 
and malaria. These examples illustrate the significant leaps that can be 
made when African countries are not forced to funnel their resources 
away in onerous debt payments.

<p>Despite last year's deal, African countries still owe over $200 billion, 
and are still required to pay $14 billion annually in debt service. This 
is barely a modest improvement from the $15 billion annual payment that 
existed before the G8 deal. Most African countries continue to spend 
more on debt repayment than on health and education for their populations.

<p>Under these current trends, most African countries will not be able to 
reach the United Nations (UN) Millennium Development Goals by 2015. If 
the international community and particularly the G8 nations are serious 
about attaining these goals, they must recognize debt cancellation as a 
necessary prerequisite and free the resources to achieve these targets.

<p>The international community must also recognize that the bulk of 
Africa's debts are illegitimate and odious. Years of creditor 
mismanagement of poorly planned projects, and irresponsible lending to 
despotic leaders during the Cold War years, have saddled African 
populations with huge and harmful debts, which must now be canceled as a 
matter of justice.

<p>Africa Action maintains that last year's G8 deal was insufficient on 
paper and carried out incompletely in practice. The agreement excluded 
the vast majority of African countries and the vast majority of Africa's 
debt. It is insufficient to alleviate the burdens sapping the 
continent's resources and its ability to face major economic, and social 
challenges, especially the HIV/AIDS pandemic. As the G8 assembles once 
again, Africa Action exhorts G8 leaders to take new action on the debt 
crisis by expanding the debt deal and cutting the harmful conditions. 
The leaders of the world's wealthiest countries must now finish what 
they started one year ago - the only moral and practical course is to 
fully cancel Africa's debt.
