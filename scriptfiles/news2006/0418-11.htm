<p>YARMOUTH PORT, Massachusetts - April 18 - This week,  Kansas Governor Kathleen Sebelius signed a bill that will make  Kansas a safer place and help prevent tragedies like Haley  Hilderbrand's death from occurring. The bill, S 578, will ban the  ownership and possession of dangerous exotic cats -- lions,  tigers, leopards, jaguars and bobcats -- bears and venomous  snakes and IFAW (International Fund for Animal Welfare -  <a href="http://releases.usnewswire.com/redir.asp?ReleaseID=64149&Link=http://www.ifaw.org">http://www.ifaw.org</a> ) has lobbied vigorously for its passage.</p>
<p>   Under the new law, exhibitors will be required to have a USDA  license and will be held to state regulations including $250,000  in liability insurance and a strict no-contact policy between  members of the public and these dangerous, wild animals.</p>
<p>   &quot;This legislation is a critical step in protecting public  safety in Kansas and is a tribute to the efforts of Haley  Hilderbrand's family, said IFAW campaigner Josephine Martell.  &quot;IFAW plans to use this momentum, with the support of Haley's  family, to further protect the American public and ensure the  welfare of big cats across the country by campaigning for  legislation at the federal level.&quot;</p>
<p>   In a statement released by Haley's parents, Ronda and Mike  Good said, &quot;This legislation was not just a reaction to Haley's  death, several incidents have occurred over the years in Kansas  and in many other states both children and adults have been  killed or seriously injured. Haley's death was just the most  recent tragedy and hopefully the last in Kansas.&quot;</p>
<p>   Since 1999, there have been at least six major big cat  incidents in Kansas including:</p>
<p>   -- In 1999, at the Safari Zoological Park a woman was severely  mauled by an adult tiger after it reached through the cage and  pulled her arm in</p>
<p>   -- In 1999, in Wichita, a 5 year-old child was severely mauled  by a five-month-old tiger and received 20 stitches in the throat  to close a near fatal wound</p>
<p>   -- In 2001, in Oskalooska, a police officer shot a privately  owned, escaped tiger as it crouched to attack him</p>
<p>   -- In August 2005, Haley Hilderbrand was killed by an adult  tiger while posing for her senior photos in Mound Valley.</p>
<p>   Kansas isn't the only state with a big cat problem. Since  1990, in the U.S. alone, big cats have killed 13 people and  mauled nearly 100 others. There are an estimated 10,000 tigers  kept as pets in the U.S., more than twice as many that live in  the wild. </p>
