WASHINGTON - June 7 - In a letter sent today  to U.S. Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, Democracy 21 President  Fred Wertheimer urged the Attorney General to &quot;take all steps  necessary to ensure that there is no political interference with  the criminal investigations being conducted by the Public  Integrity Section of the Justice Department and by U.S. Attorney  offices in California concerning political corruption and  potential criminal conduct by members of Congress.&quot;</p>
<p>   The Democracy 21 letter to Attorney General Gonzales states,  &quot;We strongly urge you to provide assurances to the public, and to  the government prosecutors handling these cases, that you will  not allow any political interference in these matters. These  criminal investigations must be pursued wherever they lead,  regardless of any political pressures that might be applied by  members of Congress or others to influence the cases.&quot;</p>
<p>   The letter continues, &quot;Our concerns about possible political  interference in these matters have only been heightened by the  reactions of House Judiciary Committee Chairman James  Sensenbrenner (R-WI) and other House leaders to the Justice  Department's obtaining of records from the congressional office  of Representative William Jefferson (D-LA), pursuant to a court- approved search warrant.&quot;</p>
<p>   According to the letter, &quot;Regardless of the constitutional  issues that may or may not be involved in the search of  Representative Jefferson's office, the overreactions of Chairman  Sensenbrenner and other House members to the execution of a  court-approved search warrant has raised concerns that  enforcement officials are being warned to stay away from  investigations involving members of Congress.&quot;</p>
<p>   The letter states, &quot;This has occurred at a time, furthermore,  when the Public Integrity Section's investigation into the Jack  Abramoff corruption scandals has reached a critical stage. While  a number of individuals have pled guilty to various criminal  activities in the Abramoff scandals, key decisions remain yet to  be made about whether criminal charges will be brought against  members of Congress.&quot;</p>
<p>   The letter continues, &quot;The Abramoff lobbying scandals have the  potential to be the biggest congressional corruption scandal in  decades. The fact that this investigation is taking place as the  2006 congressional elections are approaching only adds to  concerns about the potential for political pressures being  brought to bear in this matter regarding the decisions to be made  about members of Congress.&quot;</p>
<p>   The letter adds, &quot;Similarly, according to published reports  serious criminal investigations are being conducted by U.S.  Attorney offices in California that potentially involve members  of Congress and that may be related to the same kind of  activities which led to the criminal conviction of former  Representative Randy 'Duke' Cunningham (R-CA).&quot;</p>
<p>   The letter also notes the criminal investigation &quot;being  conducted concerning Representative Jefferson's activities,  according to published reports, with two individuals associated  with Jefferson already having pled guilty to criminal conspiracy  to bribe Jefferson.&quot;</p>
<p>   The letter further states, &quot;Based on our past correspondence  with the Justice Department, responsibility to ensure that these  criminal investigations are handled without any political  interference rests with you as Attorney General.&quot;</p>
<p>   The letter continues, &quot;On December 13, 2005, Democracy 21  wrote to Glenn A. Fine, the Inspector General of the Department  of Justice, urging him to take pro-active steps to ensure that  the Abramoff investigation is insulated from political pressure  and interference.&quot;</p>
<p>   The Democracy 21 letter states, &quot;On January 5, 2006, Mr. Fine  responded to us that the issues set forth in our December 13,  2005 letter 'fall outside the jurisdiction' of the Office of  Inspector General (OIG). Instead, he indicated that these kind of  issues 'fall within the jurisdiction of the Department's Office  of Professional Responsibility (OPR), not OIG.' In his letter,  Mr. Fine said he contacted the counsel for OPR and forwarded our  December 13 letter to that office.&quot;</p>
<p>   The Democracy 21 letter adds, &quot;On February 9, 2006, H.  Marshall Jarrett, counsel to the Office of Professional  Responsibility, informed us that our letter to the Inspector  General had been forwarded to the OPR and that he had determined  that our request 'falls outside the jurisdiction of the Office of  Professional Responsibility.' Mr. Jarrett said that OPR does not  have jurisdiction 'to monitor ongoing investigations by  components of the Criminal Division.'&quot;</p>
<p>   According to the Democracy 21 letter, &quot;Given the fact that the  Justice Department's OIG and the OPR each state they have no  jurisdiction to ensure the integrity of the Justice Department's  criminal investigations against potential political interference,  we can only conclude that the responsibility rests squarely with  you to protect the integrity of the Abramoff investigation and  the other criminal investigations involving members of Congress  from political interference.&quot;</p>
<p>   The letter continues, &quot;We have seen no basis, to date, for  questioning the Justice Department's handling of these criminal  investigations. Available public information indicates that the  Department has been pursuing these matters in a serious and  professional way.&quot;</p>
<p>   The letter states, &quot;But there have been disturbing reports of  past political interference at the Justice Department with the  decisions of career professionals in cases involving the Voting  Rights Act and the tobacco industry. These past reports reinforce  the need for your public assurances that no political  interference will be allowed in the current criminal  investigations involving members of Congress.&quot;</p>
<p>   The letter provides information based on published reports  about the Justice Department's handling of the Voting Rights Act  and tobacco cases.</p>
<p>   The letter concludes, &quot;The integrity and public credibility of  the Justice Department is at stake in the ongoing criminal  investigations involving members of Congress. Democracy 21 calls  on you to provide public assurances, and to make clear to members  of Congress and other government officials, that no political  interference will be allowed in these cases and that all  decisions will be made strictly on the merits by the officials  handling the cases.&quot;</p>
