<p>WASHINGTON - July 25 - More than three years into the genocide in 
Darfur, there is a belated international consensus on the need for a 
United Nations (UN) peacekeeping force to provide protection to 
civilians and humanitarian operations in western Sudan. As Africa Action 
has previously noted, the establishment of a UN peacekeeping mission in 
Darfur has now received the support of the U.S., the UN 
Secretary-General, most members of the UN Security Council, the African 
Union (AU), the leadership of the Arab League, and dozens of 
organizations and millions of public citizens.

<p>Yet the government of Sudan, the author of the ongoing genocide in 
Darfur, adamantly refuses to allow a UN mission into Darfur and 
continues to hold hostage the international response to this crisis. For 
weeks and months, the international community has been paralyzed in the 
face of Khartoum's opposition. Countless Darfuri lives have been lost as 
mounting violence has overwhelmed the small AU operation in Darfur, and 
the partial peace deal signed in Abuja on May 5th remains fragile at 
best. Despite the desperate need of the people of Darfur for protection, 
the international community has failed to overcome Khartoum's opposition 
and take the necessary action to achieve a UN peacekeeping force.

<p>The U.S. can and must be the one to break the deadlock on Darfur. The 
U.S. has unique power and leverage with the government of Sudan that can 
end the stalemate and advance the goal of a UN peacekeeping mission for 
Darfur. The U.S. also remains the only government to have publicly 
acknowledged that what is happening in Darfur constitutes genocide, 
though it has failed to articulate or pursue a strategy to improve the 
security situation on the ground. If the U.S. is committed to ending 
this genocide, it must use its power to protect the people of Darfur and 
secure the necessary UN peacekeeping force now.

<p><b>Precedents</b>

<p>In the past, U.S. pressure on Sudan has yielded results. In the 1990s, 
the Clinton Administration focused on the isolation and containment of 
Khartoum, particularly in reaction to Khartoum's hosting of Al-Qaeda and 
Osama bin Laden from 1991 to 1996. In the early 1990s, U.S. sanctions 
ended bilateral aid to Sudan, and in 1993, Sudan was added to the list 
of state sponsors of terrorism. The U.S. also supported a 1996 UN 
Security Council resolution censuring Khartoum for failing to extradite 
suspects in an assassination attempt on the Egyptian president. Finally, 
also in 1996, the U.S. removed any American diplomatic presence from 
Sudan. These ostracizing tactics had an impact on Khartoum, and in 1996, 
the Sudanese government responded by expelling Osama bin Laden and 
subsequently distancing itself from such terrorist networks.

<p>Under the Bush Administration, strong U.S. diplomatic engagement in 
efforts to end the decades long civil war in Sudan ultimately helped to 
secure the signing of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) in 2005. 
The U.S. made clear that any future "normalization" of relations, 
including the lifting of economic sanctions, was contingent on a 
successful conclusion to the North-South peace process, and this was a 
key factor in pushing the Sudanese government to the negotiating table. 
Though the subsequent implementation of the CPA has had serious 
challenges, and though the U.S. commitment in this area has been 
insufficient, it is generally agreed that U.S. diplomatic investment in 
the peace process influenced the Sudanese government's position, 
including its consent to a UN peacekeeping mission for southern Sudan.

<p><b>Current Pressure Points</b>

<p>Africa Action has previously pointed out that the current relationship 
between the U.S. and Sudan features "strategic priorities", such as 
intelligence-sharing, that have undermined a stronger U.S. response on 
Darfur. As the world seeks Khartoum's acquiescence to a UN mission, and 
as the U.S. claims a commitment to ending this crisis, this relationship 
gives the U.S. special leverage to pressure Khartoum to accept a robust 
Chapter VII UN peacekeeping force for Darfur. The Sudanese government 
wishes to strengthen its ties with Washington, and ultimately 
"normalize" relations, and the Bush Administration must use all 
available pressure points to force the necessary action from Khartoum 
and to pave the way for a UN mission to protect civilians and 
humanitarian operations, and to support the goal of peace in Darfur:

<p><li>The U.S. should make clear to Khartoum that the future of U.S. 
relations with Sudan depends on Khartoum's cooperation with the 
international community in allowing a UN peacekeeping mission into 
Darfur. The Sudanese government had previously stated that it would 
welcome a UN mission after the signing of a peace deal in Abuja, and it 
must now adhere to this commitment. President Bush has repeatedly stated 
that a UN mission is needed in Darfur and he should call President 
Bashir directly to convey this position and the expectation of Sudanese 
cooperation in this regard.

<p><li>The U.S. should push for new sanctions against senior Sudanese 
government officials responsible for the continuing violence in Darfur, 
pursuant to UN Security Council Resolution 1591. Thus far, only four 
individuals have faced sanctions, and no sitting Sudanese official has 
been targeted. The U.S. should seek further targeted sanctions through 
the Security Council, including asset freezes and travel bans.

<p><li>The U.S. should offer its cooperation to the International Criminal 
Court (ICC) in its proceedings against those charged with war crimes and 
crimes against humanity in Darfur. The relationship between the U.S. and 
Sudan, particularly with regard to counter-terrorism efforts, has 
provided the U.S. with unique insights and information that should be 
made available to the ICC.

<p><li>The U.S. should encourage other countries to enact comprehensive 
bilateral sanctions against Sudan, as the U.S. has had in place since 
1997, precluding investment in Sudan's growing industry and other such 
economic relations. Such sanctions would register international outrage 
at the ongoing crisis in Darfur, for which the Khartoum government must 
be held responsible.

<p><li>The U.S. should use its relationships with governments around the 
world to "internationalize" pressure on Khartoum and create a united 
front for new and urgent action on Darfur. Just as the U.S. has leverage 
with the Sudanese government, it also has bilateral leverage with 
Sudan's allies on the Security Council (particularly Russia and China), 
and it must use this leverage now to enlist their support to pressure 
Khartoum to admit a UN peacekeeping operation into Darfur.

<p><li>While Khartoum's advance consent for a UN peacekeeping mission in 
Darfur is desirable, the urgency of the crisis requires the Security 
Council to take new action regardless. Even as it takes steps to 
increase pressure on Khartoum, the U.S. must simultaneously seek the UN 
Security Council's authorization of a robust UN peacekeeping operation 
with a Chapter VII mandate and an expedited timeline.

<p>Africa Action emphasizes that the U.S. is uniquely positioned to bring 
effective pressure to bear on Khartoum to accept the international 
community's demand for a UN mission in Darfur. By taking the steps 
described above, the U.S. will show that it is committed to protecting 
the people of Darfur, and that this is the priority in U.S. policy 
toward Sudan. New U.S. action is needed now to break the international 
deadlock and achieve a rapid and robust UN peacekeeping force for Darfur.
