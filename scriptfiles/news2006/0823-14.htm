<p>BOSTON - August 23 - Rejecting wildly overblown 
assertions that private phone companies can hide behind a &#8220;state secrets&#8221; 
argument, the American Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts today said it has 
filed legal papers with the Massachusetts Department of Telecommunications and 
Energy (DTE) calling for a prompt public hearing on a May 2006 complaint against 
Verizon and AT&amp;T for their reported role in facilitating illegal government 
spying on ordinary Americans.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&#8220;This case is about transparency and 
telling people the truth about what the phone companies are doing with our 
records,&#8221; said Carol Rose, Executive Director of the ACLU of Massachusetts. 
&#8220;Massachusetts residents have a right to know how the phone companies respond to 
requests for private phone records when there is no warrant or court 
order.&#8221;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;The ACLU filing comes on the heels of a federal court 
ruling last Thursday that the Bush Administration&#8217;s program to monitor the phone 
calls and e-mails of Americans without warrants is unconstitutional and must be 
stopped. (<A class=noline_blue href="http://www.aclu.org/safefree/nsaspying/index.html">www.aclu.org/safefree/nsaspying/index.html</A>).<BR>&nbsp;<BR>On 
May 24, the ACLU of Massachusetts filed a complaint on behalf of the mayors of 
Newton, Somerville, Chicopee, and Northampton, alleging that these phone 
companies enabled illegal government spying by turning over private details 
about Americans&#8217; telephone calls to the National Security Agency (NSA) without 
proper warrants. The ACLU has requested that the DTE hold a public hearing on 
the mayors&#8217; complaint that Verizon and AT&amp;T disclosed call records of their 
Massachusetts customers without the customers&#8217; knowledge or legal authorization. 
Both Verizon and AT&amp;T have urged the DTE to dismiss the complaint on the 
grounds of state secrets. <BR>&nbsp;<BR>&#8220;Private companies cannot invoke state 
secrets privilege &#8211; only the United States government can assert such a claim,&#8221; 
Rose said.&nbsp; &#8220;The DTE has a legal obligation to hold public hearings into 
whether the phone companies have violated their own policies, the law, or their 
customers&#8217; right to privacy. Such a hearing should not involve state secrets. 
Instead, the hearing should focus on the specific question of how 
telecommunications companies in Massachusetts respond to government requests for 
private phone records where there is no warrant or court 
order.&#8221;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>News reports have indicated that at least three companies &#8211; 
Verizon, BellSouth, and AT&amp;T &#8211; have complied with warrantless requests from 
the NSA to turn over the calling records of millions of customers across the 
nation. <BR>&nbsp;<BR>On June 30, USA Today reported that 19 lawmakers confirmed 
that the NSA has built a massive database of tens of millions of phone records 
to monitor Americans' calling patterns. USA Today also reported that five of 
those lawmakers confirmed that AT&amp;T has participated in the program and 
stated that BellSouth did not. Three lawmakers stated that Verizon did not 
participate in the program but that its subsidiary, MCI, 
did.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>Beginning in 2001, President Bush secretly authorized the 
National Security Agency to conduct electronic surveillance of people within the 
United States, including U.S. citizens, without a warrant. The ongoing 
surveillance program has been in direct violation of the Foreign Intelligence 
Surveillance Act (FISA), a federal law that requires the executive branch to 
obtain a warrant before engaging in electronic surveillance of 
Americans.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>"There are clear inconsistencies in the information, 
statements, representations, and guarantees to the customers of Verizon and 
AT&amp;T regarding the private status of their personal information," said ACLU 
of Massachusetts Legal Director John Reinstein. "In light of the reported 
disclosure of this information to the NSA, there are well-founded concerns that 
these companies have violated their own privacy policies &#8211; as well as violated 
state and federal regulations and laws that protect all customers. The DTE has a 
responsibility under Massachusetts law to investigate these violations of the 
privacy of Massachusetts customers."<BR>&nbsp;<BR>Massachusetts law requires the 
DTE to hold a public hearing if a written complaint is filed on behalf of any 
Massachusetts mayor. The ACLU of Massachusetts filed its complaint and request 
for a hearing on behalf of Mayors David B. Cohen of Newton, Joseph A. Curtatone 
of Somerville, Michael D. Bissonnette of Chicopee, and Mary Clare Higgins of 
Northampton.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>The ACLU filed its response just one day after the 
U.S. Department of Justice filed a federal lawsuit against officials of the 
Maine Public Utilities Commission and Verizon, seeking to stop Verizon from 
answering questions posed by the commission. The DOJ lawsuit also seeks to 
prevent any further investigation of Verizon&#8217;s collaboration with the National 
Security Agency Surveillance program. The DOJ filed a similar lawsuit in New 
Jersey last month. <BR>&nbsp;<BR>In Vermont, Governor Jim Douglas is supporting 
a similar investigation, despite a threat from the federal government to sue the 
state, saying, :We don&#8217;t want this kind of intrusion into the privacy of 
Vermonters by anyone, by government, or by companies.&#8221; <BR>&nbsp;<BR>In 
Connecticut, the Department of Public Utility Control &#8211; that state's equivalent 
of the DTE &#8211; denied Verizon's motion to dismiss a complaint from the ACLU of 
Connecticut, and has scheduled a hearing for September 6. <BR>&nbsp;<BR>&#8220;No one 
&#8211; not the DOJ, the NSA or private phone companies &#8211; is above the law,&#8221; said 
Rose. "Government spying on innocent Americans without any kind of warrant and 
without Congressional approval runs counter to the very foundations of our 
democracy.&#8221; <BR>&nbsp;<BR>
