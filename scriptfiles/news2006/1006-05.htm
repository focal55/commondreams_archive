<p>WASHINGTON - October 6 - On the 30th 
                  anniversary of the first and only mid-air bombing of a civilian 
                  airliner in the Western Hemisphere, the National Security Archive 
                  today posted on the Web new investigative records that further 
                  implicate Luis Posada Carriles in that crime of international 
                  terrorism. Among the documents posted is an <a href="http://www.gwu.edu/%7Ensarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB202/HSCA00000346.pdf" target="_blank"><strong>annotated 
                  list</strong></a> of four volumes of still-secret records on 
                  Posada's career with the CIA, his acts of violence, and his 
                  suspected involvement in the bombing of Cubana flight 455 on 
                  October 6, 1976, which took the lives of all 73 people on board, 
                  many of them teenagers. </p>
                <p>The National Security Archive, which has sought the declassification 
                  of the Posada files through the Freedom of Information Act, 
                  today called on the U.S. government to release all intelligence 
                  files on Posada. &quot;Now is the time for the government to 
                  come clean on Posada's covert past and his involvement in international 
                  terrorism,&quot; said Peter Kornbluh, who directs the Archive's 
                  Cuba Documentation Project. &quot;His victims, the public, and 
                  the courts have a right to know.&quot;</p>
                <p>Posada has been in detention in El Paso, Texas, for illegal 
                  entry into the United States, but a magistrate has recommended 
                  that he be released this week because the Bush administration 
                  has not certified that he is a terrorist.</p>
                <p>Among the documents posted today are <a href="http://www.gwu.edu/%7Ensarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB202/index.htm#affidavits"><strong>four 
                  sworn affidavits</strong></a> by police officials in Trinidad 
                  and Tobago, who were the first to interrogate the two Venezuelans--Hernan 
                  Ricardo Lozano and Freddy Lugo--who were arrested for placing 
                  the bomb on flight 455. (Their statements were turned over as 
                  evidence to a special investigative commission in Barbados after 
                  the crime.) Information derived from the interrogations suggested 
                  that the first call the bombers placed after the attack was 
                  to the office of Luis Posada's security company ICI, which employed 
                  Ricardo. Ricardo claimed to have been a CIA agent (but later 
                  retracted that claim). He said that he had been paid $16,000 
                  to sabotage the plane and that Lugo was paid $8,000.</p>
                <p>The interrogations revealed that a tube of Colgate toothpaste 
                  had been used to disguise plastic explosives that were set off 
                  with a &quot;pencil-type&quot; detonator on a timer after Ricardo 
                  and Lugo got off the plane during a stopover in Barbados. Ricardo 
                  &quot;in his own handwriting recorded the steps to be taken 
                  before a bomb was placed in an aircraft and how a plastic bomb 
                  is detonated,&quot; deputy commissioner of police Dennis Elliott 
                  Ramdwar testified in <a href="19761026_ramdwar.pdf" target="_blank"><strong>his 
                  affidavit</strong>.</a></p>
                <p>The Archive also released three declassified FBI intelligence 
                  reports that were sent to Secretary of State Henry Kissinger 
                  after the bombing. The updates, classified &quot;secret&quot; 
                  and signed by director Clarence Kelly, focused on the relations 
                  between the FBI legal attach&eacute; in Caracas, Joseph Leo, 
                  Posada, and one of the Venezuelans who placed the bomb on the 
                  plane, to whom Leo had provided a visa. <strong><a href="http://www.gwu.edu/%7Ensarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB202/19761105.pdf" target="_blank">One 
                  report from Kelly</a></strong>, based on the word of an informant 
                  in Venezuela, suggested that Posada had attended meetings in 
                  Caracas where the plane bombing was planned. The document also 
                  quoted an informant as stating that after the plane went into 
                  the ocean one of the bombers placed a call to Orlando Bosch, 
                  the leading conspirator in the plot, and stated: &quot;a bus 
                  with 73 dogs went off a cliff and all got killed.&quot;</p>
                <p>Another State Department Bureau of Intelligence and Research 
                  <a href="19761018.pdf" target="_blank"> <strong>report to Kissinger</strong>,</a>                posted again today, noted that the CIA had a source in Venezuela 
                who had overheard Posada saying &quot;we are going to hit a 
                  Cuban airplane&quot; and &quot;Orlando has the details&quot; 
                  only days before the plane was blown up off the coast of Barbados.</p>
                <p>Both Bosch and Posada were arrested and imprisoned in Venezuela 
                  after the attack. Posada escaped from prison in September 1985; 
                  Bosch was released in 1987 and returned to the United States 
                  illegally. Like Posada, he was detained by immigration authorities; 
                  over the objections of the Justice Department, which determined 
                  he was a threat to public security, the first President Bush's 
                  White House issued him an administrative pardon in 1990.<br>
                  <br>
                  Still-secret intelligence documents cited in the file review 
                  released today suggest that the CIA assigned several cryptonyms 
                  to Posada when he was working for them, first as an operative 
                  and trainer in demolitions and later as an informant based in 
                  the Venezuelan secret police service DISIP. In 1965 he was assigned 
                  the codename &quot;AMCLEVE-15.&quot; In 1972 he &quot;was given 
                  a new crypt CIFENCE-4,&quot; according to a still-unreleased 
                CIA document, and later referred to as &quot;WKSCARLET-3.&quot;</p>
