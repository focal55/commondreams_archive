<p>GENEVA, Switzerland - July 24 - Campaigners from Friends of the 
Earth International today welcomed the collapse of the World Trade 
Organisation (WTO)'s trade negotiations. This means that there is now 
time to review and reconsider the multilateral trading system in its 
entirety.

<p>This will be welcome news to millions of people around the world who 
feared that a WTO deal would have further impoverished the world's 
poorest people and caused irreparable damage to the environment. 
Developing countries, including India, also fear that a WTO deal would 
cause immense harm to millions of small and subsistence farmers.

<p>Alberto Villarreal, Trade Campaigner at Friends of the Earth in Latin 
America, currently in Geneva, said "The collapse of these talks is good 
news. The proposals on the table had been driven by certain governments 
attempting to put the commercial interests of corporations before the 
needs of workers, farmers, and the global environment."




<p>Ronnie Hall, Trade Campaigner at Friends of the Earth International 
added: "The delay created by the failure of the Doha negotiations must 
be used to review past negotiations and analyse the flaws in the WTO 
system as a whole. It will allow us to reflect on how to develop 
multilateral governance systems that will genuinely promote fair and 
sustainable societies that benefit everyone."

<p>The so-called 'Doha Development Agenda' is not about development. 
Recent World Bank and other studies [1] - and even government 
negotiators [2] themselves - give witness to the fact that the current 
trade liberalizing agenda is not working for the majority of people in 
the developing countries. It is clear that the interests of the largest 
and most powerful countries and their transnational companies continue 
to dominate the WTO's agenda. [3]

<p>Furthermore, consideration of the disastrous potential global 
environmental impact of current negotiating proposals is virtually 
non-existent within the WTO [4]. This is in spite of the fact that there 
is increasing evidence elsewhere, including from studies commissioned by 
the European Commission, that escalating international trade in natural 
resources is likely to damage global biodiversity and local economies. [5]

<p>Indeed, if more natural resources are traded internationally instead of 
being available for use locally - as certain countries and transnational 
corporations wish - this could increase poverty for millions in the 
world's poorest communities.[6]

<p>For example, forests and fish and fish products are both sectors slated 
for complete or exceptionally high levels of liberalization in the WTO's 
current negotiations. Yet worldwide, some 60 million indigenous people 
are almost completely reliant on forest resources for their livelihoods 
- for food and fuel, medicines and materials - and some 36 million 
people directly employed in small-scale artisanal fishing [7]. 
Similarly, current negotiations to expand international trade in 
agricultural products could threaten the livelihoods of millions of 
small and peasant farmers worldwide. In short, poverty could be 
increased significantly by the WTO's negotiations. This would go 
completely against the grain of governments' existing Millennium 
Development commitment to halve world poverty by 2005.




<p>NOTES TO EDITORS

<p>[1] A study by the World Bank's Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) 
released in March 2006 concluded that the World Bank's strategies on 
trade have not delivered on employment and poverty reduction. World 
Bank's Independent Evaluation Group Issues report Assessing Two Decades 
of Global Trade Programs, IEG, World Bank, Washington DC, 22 March 2006, 
<a href="http://www.worldbank.org/ieg/trade/docs/press_release_trade_evaluation.pdf" target="_new">www.worldbank.org/ieg/trade/docs/press_release_trade_evaluation.pdf</a>. In 
addtion, a 2006 study by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace 
also suggests that the gains that have been predicted from world trade 
are likely to be much more modest than has been portrayed, with those 
countries particularly reliant on subsistence farming likely to be 
harmed. Winners and Losers: Impact of the Doha Round on Developing

Trade and Labour, Commonwealth of Dominica, has said: "In recent times, 
the rules, norms and procedures of the multilateral trading system have 
pushed the Caribbean to the precipice of disaster.Called the Doha 
Development Round, these on-going trade talks are failing the Region." 
Caribbean Regional Negotiating Machinery press release, No. 27/2005, 
December 6, 2005. The G33 group of countries has also recently sent a 
letter to Pascal Lamy stating that its members will not accept proposed 
modalities for agriculture if these do not include modalities on special 
products (SPs) and a special safeguard mechanism (SSM) that are key 
aspects of special and differential treatment for developing 
countries(Geneva, 20 April). These were agreed in Hong Kong but have now 
been sidelined for attention at some later date.

<p>[3] Some WTO papers are surprisingly explicit about engagement with 
industry. For example: "This forest products proposal is driven by 
industry interest. The Santa Catalina Group, which has industry 
representatives from both developed and developing countries, has met 
with NAMA negotiators on several occasions to discuss its members' 
priorities" Market Access for Non-Agricultural Products, Tariff 
Liberalization in the Forests Product Sector, Communication from Canada, 
Hong Kong China, New Zealand, Thailand and the United States, 
TN/MA/W/64, 18 October 2005 (05-4784), World Trade Organization, Geneva.

<p>[4] The WTO's Committee on Trade and Environment is mandated to oversee 
the environmental impacts of all the WTO's current negotiations but has 
not done so. Indeed, there is an unwritten rule in the WTO that 
multilateral environmental or sustainability impact assessments are not 
permitted, because they are too controversial, as Pascal Lamy himself 
confirmed in a meeting with civil society , 17 October 2005.

<p>[5] The European Commission-financed sustainability impact assessment on 
the forest sector, for example, demonstrates that there are likely to be 
significant and irreversible impacts on forests and biodiversity in 
'biodiversity hotspot' countries such as Brazil, Indonesia, countries in 
the Congo Basin and Papua New Guinea. In addition, countries that 
currently protect their forest industries using trade measures can 
expect those industries to shrink and possibly collapse. Sustainability
