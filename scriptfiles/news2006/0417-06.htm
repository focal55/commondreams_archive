<p>WASHINGTON - April 17 - The University of Michigan, New York University and several other 
      institutions in the U.S., Canada and Europe have recently severed 
      relationships with The Coca-Cola Company because Coca-Cola would not agree 
      to an independent third party investigation of allegations of human 
      rights, labor and environmental abuses by its bottlers in Colombia and 
      India. 

<P>On April 10, Coke informed Tim Slottow, Executive Vice President and 
      CFO of the University of Michigan, that independent investigations would 
      take place in Colombia and India. According to Coca-Cola, the United 
      Nations International Labor Organization (ILO) has agreed to do an 
      &#8220;investigation and evaluation&#8221; in Colombia and The Energy and Resources 
      Institute (TERI) was developing an &#8220;impartial independent third party 
      assessment of water resource management practices at Coca-Cola facilities 
      in India&#8230;&#8221; 
<P>The University of Michigan, apparently without even checking Coke&#8217;s 
      claims, immediately issued a statement that said it would resume purchases 
      of Coca-Cola products that was suspended in January. The decision was made 
      by Mr. Slottow without any consultation with students or the 
      University&#8217;s Dispute Review Board (DRB). &#8220;Mr. Slottow has done a real 
      disservice to students and the entire University of Michigan community, as 
      well as to workers and communities in Colombia and India,&#8221; said Ray 
      Rogers, director of the Campaign to Stop Killer Coke. &#8220;He and his advisors 
      have foolishly failed to check out Coke&#8217;s claims or the close 
      relationships that already exist between Coke and its so-called &#8216;third 
      party investigators&#8217;.&#8221; 
<P><B>ILO, Coca-Cola and Colombia </B>
<P>First, regarding the Colombia situation: In a letter to Mr. Slottow on 
      April 10, Coca-Cola North America President Donald Knauss wrote: &#8220;On March 
      2nd, the International Union of Food, Agricultural, Hotel, Restaurant, 
      Catering, Tobacco and Allied Workers&#8217; Associations (IUF) announced that it 
      requested the International Labor Organization (ILO) to investigate and 
      evaluate past and present labor relations and workers&#8217; rights practices of 
      the Coca-Cola bottling operations in Colombia&#8230;&#8221; 
<P>Since the Campaign to Stop Killer Coke began in 2003, the IUF has 
      opposed efforts by students on behalf of SINALTRAINAL, the non-IUF union 
      representing most unionized Coke workers in Colombia, to ban Coke products 
      from their campuses and student unions. The only union in Colombia 
      affiliated with the IUF that represents Coke workers is SICO, a company 
      union with 40 to 50 Coke workers. SICO replaced SINALTRAINAL after 
      SINALTRAINAL&#8217;s union officer Isidro Gil was assassinated by paramilitaries 
      inside the Carepa Coca-Cola bottling plant and his local union was 
      crushed. (See <A href="http://www.killercoke.org/iufsinal.htm">&#8220;Why Does 
      the IUF Attack SINALTRAINAL?&#8221;)</A> 
<P>In the April 10 letter, Mr. Knauss also wrote: &#8220;Questions concerning 
      the ILO investigation and evaluation should be directed to Ms. Sally 
      Paxton, Executive Director, Social Dialogue.&#8221; In an April 12 phone 
      conversation with Ray Rogers, Ms. Paxton contradicted at least two crucial 
      points in Mr. Knauss&#8217;s letter. First, she emphasized that the ILO would 
      only do an &#8220;assessment of current working conditions,&#8221; not of past labor 
      relations practices. Second, she insisted that the ILO was not 
      going to conduct &#8220;an investigation,&#8221; adding that there won&#8217;t even be 
      an assessment of the parent company Coca-Cola, only an &#8220;assessment&#8221; of the 
      enterprises in Colombia. 
<P>When asked who would fund the &#8220;assessment,&#8221; Ms. Paxton responded, &#8220;The 
      money will come from outside donors or the regular budget. That has not 
      yet been decided.&#8221; Ms. Paxton said that the model developed for Better 
      Factories Cambodia, a project of the ILO, would be used in the Colombia 
      &#8220;assessment.&#8221; According to the ILO website, &#8220;Better Factories Cambodia 
      aims to improve working conditions in Cambodia&#8217;s export garment factories. 
      It combines independent monitoring with finding solutions, through 
      suggestions to management, training, advice and information.&#8221; The ILO 
      website adds that the outside donors for the Cambodian project included 
      the Garment Manufacturers Association in Cambodia, whose council is 
      entirely composed of executives from the Cambodian garment industry. Does 
      this mean that the ILO will seek or accept funding from the American 
      Beverage Assn., whose board includes Donald Knauss himself and other Coke 
      executives? 
<P>The ILO has a tripartite structure, consisting of 28 representatives of 
      governments, 14 representatives of employers and 14 representatives of 
      labor. Labor observers and advocates who are familiar with the ILO say 
      that the organization is heavily skewed against workers, since most 
      government representatives align themselves with the employer 
      representatives. Imagine if this multinational body was simply a U.S. 
      body. What chance would workers have to advance any part of their agenda? 
      Because of the stranglehold over the Congress that corporate lobbyists 
      enjoy, U.S. labor can&#8217;t even get legislation enacted to protect workers&#8217; 
      basic rights. 
<P>Why is Coca-Cola so comfortable with Ms. Paxton overseeing this 
      so-called &#8220;investigation and evaluation&#8221;? &#8220;Ms. Paxton was a partner in 
      private practice at Fulbright and Jaworski, concentrating in civil 
      litigation at both the trial and appellate levels in a variety of 
      subjects, including labor and employment law,&#8221; according to her 
      biography on the ILO&#8217;s site. The Fulbright &amp; Jaworski website states 
      that the firm &#8220;represents companies in lawsuits involving disputes 
      under collective bargaining agreements&#8221; and &#8220;defends employers 
      before the National Labor Relations Board&#8221; &#8212; not quite the resume of an 
      impartial juror or an unbiased administrator. The law firm has represented 
      ExxonMobil, Duke Energy, Merck &amp; Co and other companies with 
      questionable records on matters involving ethics, exploitation and/or 
      environmental concerns. 
<P><B>Coke&#8217;s Edward Potter and the ILO</B> 
<P>Edward E. Potter, Coca-Cola&#8217;s Director of Global Labor Relations and 
      Workplace Accountability, serves on the Applications of Conventions 
      Committee within the International Labor Organization. He is currently 
      the head spokesperson for the entire Employers&#8217; Group, a powerful position 
      within the ILO structure to promote the interests of big business and thus 
      the interests of Coca-Cola. In addition, Potter leads the U.S. 
      employer delegation to the ILO&#8217;s annual conference that is coordinated 
      through the United States Council for International Business, which is on 
      the ILO&#8217;s governing body. 
<P>Over the past year, Potter has demanded that any evidence uncovered by 
      an investigation of Coca-Cola and its Colombian bottlers that indicated 
      Coke committed labor or human rights abuses could not be used in the 
      lawsuit filed by the International Labor Rights Fund (ILRF) and the United 
      Steelworkers on behalf of SINALTRAINAL, several of its members and the 
      survivors of Isidro Gil, one of its murdered officers. ILRF Executive 
      Director Terry Collingsworth responded to Mr. Potter&#8217;s demand in a 
      November 14 letter: &#8220;We cannot prejudice our clients by agreeing to bury 
      evidence that would support their claims,&#8221; he said. 
<P>During the process of seeking an independent investigation of Coke&#8217;s 
      practices, students asserted: &#8220;The investigation in Colombia must include 
      both CURRENT and PAST issues: issues relating to the present lawsuit MAY 
      NOT BE EXCLUDED from the investigation &#8212; as these are some of the most 
      egregious violations of our codes and also some of the most contentious 
      issues in this case. This includes issues such as the murders, torture and 
      kidnapping of union workers.&#8221; Mr. Potter insisted that there be no 
      investigation of past abuses. 
<P>The proposed ILO assessment of current conditions &#8212; not an 
      &#8220;investigation,&#8221; as explained by Sally Paxton &#8212; is exactly what Mr. Potter 
      and Coca-Cola have wanted all along: a blatantly biased evaluation that 
      will ignore past abuses and will not hold the company accountable in any 
      meaningful way. 
<P>Because of Coke&#8217;s partnerships and financial relationships with the 
      United Nations, as well as the above-mentioned conflicts of interest, no 
      arm of the UN can be considered an impartial, independent investigator or 
      evaluator of Coca-Cola&#8217;s labor relations and labor rights practices. 
      Coca-Cola&#8217;s scheme for worldwide growth specifically includes partnerships 
      with the United Nations. For example, the company touts its $1.5 
      million fund to support up to 100 projects over five years. The 
      projects involve education, the environment, culture/arts and sports, but 
      essentially serve as vehicles to promote the Coca-Cola brand name and its 
      beverages to young people, the primary target group for Coke&#8217;s marketing. 
      These projects include youth activities, such as the national youth day in 
      Turkey and a large music festival called Rock 'n Coke.
<P>In another UN-related public relations scam, Coca-Cola announced in 
      mid-March that it had signed on to the UN Global Compact, which has been 
      described by its senior officer, Gavin Power, as &#8220;a voluntary initiative 
      to promote and advance a principles-based approach to corporate 
      responsibility.&#8221; Mr. Power added: &#8220;It is not a regulatory body nor 
      monitoring instrument&#8230; The Global Compact is not a club for &#8216;perfect 
      companies,&#8217; if such organizations even exist. It is a platform for 
      companies to work on universal principles and related challenging issues 
      and improve their performance over time.&#8221; 
<P>&#8220;The Global Compact is another public relations vehicle for imperfect 
      companies,&#8221; said Ray Rogers. &#8220;Nothing is expected of them nor do they 
      expect to do anything to become perfect or even respectable.&#8221; 
<P><B>TERI, Coca-Cola and India</B> 
<P>Regarding the situation in India, Coca-Cola North America President 
      Donald Knauss&#8217;s April 10 letter to the University of Michigan&#8217;s Mr. 
      Slottow stated: &#8220;We are in active dialogue with TERI, a highly respected 
      Delhi-based NGO with deep experience on sustainability issues to develop a 
      transparent and impartial independent third party assessment of water 
      resource management practices at Coca-Cola company facilities in India&#8230;&#8221; 
<P>One day later, Mr. Slottow wrote to Donald Knauss: &#8220;&#8230;(We) are 
      supportive of your work with The Energy and Resources Institute 
      (TERI), a highly respected nonprofit organization with more than 30 
      years of experience and leadership on sustainability issues, to develop a 
      transparent and independent third party assessment of water resource 
      management practice at Coca-Cola bottling plants in India&#8230;&#8221; 
<P><B>How could the University of Michigan be duped into believing that 
      TERI could develop an impartial independent third party assessment? 
      Consider the facts: </B>
<P>

</li>
</ol>
<P><B>Furthermore, the Coca-Cola Co. is publishing misleading articles and 
      advertisements and making misleading presentations to college audiences, 
      claiming:</B> 
<P> 
<ol>
<li>&#8220;For the third consecutive year, we were presented the prestigious 
      Golden Peacock Environment Management Award for environmental practices.&#8221; (Director of Global Labor Relations and Workplace Accountability Edward E. 
Potter, <I>Business Today</I>, Spring 2006)<br>
<br>
Mr. Potter neglects to mention that the award is given by the Institute 
      of Directors and the World Environmental Foundation. Sanjiv Gupta, 
      President and CEO of Coca-Cola India sits on the Executive Council of the <A href="http://www.iodonline.com/">Institute of Directors</A>. <A 
      href="http://www.wef.org.uk/">The World Environmental Foundation</A> is 
sponsored by Coca-Cola, as the group&#8217;s website makes clear. <br>
<br>
</li>
<li>That the Coca-Cola India plant in Kaladrea won the &#8220;Innovative 
      Project Award&#8221; from the Confederation of Indian Industry for its 
      contribution towards reduction in specific water consumption.
<P>Here Coca-Cola fails to disclose the fact that Tarun Das, 
      Director-General of the Confederation of Indian Industry, serves on the <A 
      href="http://www2.coca-cola.com/ourcompany/intl_adv_council.html">International 
Advisory Council of The Coca-Cola Company</A>.</li>
<li>
<P>That Coca-Cola India received recognition from the Indian Red Cross 
for its environmental programs. </li>
</ol><P>But we ask: Could that award have anything to do with the fact that <A 
      href="http://www2.coca-cola.com/ourcompany/wn20050107_tsunami.html">Coca-Cola 
      pledged $10 million to international and local relief agencies, including 
      the International Red Cross</A>, after the tsunami disaster? 
<P>&#8220;This latest attempt by Coca-Cola to mislead the media, campus 
      administrators and the public is just another example of how the company 
      announces deceptive initiatives just prior to its annual shareholders&#8217; 
      meetings,&#8221; said Rogers. &#8220;Last year, it was the Cal Safety Compliance 
      Corporation&#8217;s bogus report clearing Coke of wrongdoing in Colombia, a 
      report commissioned and paid for by Coke. The <I>Los Angeles Times</I>, 
      <I>Business Week </I>and other major media exposed Cal Safety&#8217;s lack of 
      credibility and the fact that it overlooked the most egregious violations 
      in several high-profile cases of human rights and labor abuses.&#8221; 
<P>A thorough investigation into Cal Safety's monitoring methodology by 
      Dr. Jill Esbenshade, author of "Monitoring Sweatshops," revealed that the 
      company consistently failed to adhere to minimum accepted standards for 
      competent factory investigations. 
<P>&#8220;This year&#8217;s attempt by Coca-Cola to mislead the public is equally 
      self-serving and deceptive,&#8221; Rogers concluded. &#8220;If Mr. Slottow&#8217;s decision 
      is allowed to stand, the University of Michigan&#8217;s reputation for high 
      ethical standards and careful consideration of moral and ethical questions 
will have been compromised beyond any hope of repair.
