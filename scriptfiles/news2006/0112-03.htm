<p>WASHINGTON - January 12 - The National Campaign for Nonviolent Resistance Against the War in Iraq (NCNR) is initiating a campaign of nonviolent sit-ins at the offices of members of Congress who refuse to speak out or otherwise take appropriate action to end the war.

<p>"A Call to Conscience for the U.S. Congress" will begin on the national Martin Luther King holiday on January 16, honoring the fallen leader’s philosophy of nonviolence and his opposition to war, and extend through the third commemoration of the beginning of the war, on March 20. It is expected that dozens of local groups will join the nonviolent campaign to move their members of Congress; a listing of initial planned actions immediately below, and additional actions will be announced as they are finalized in the coming weeks. (Additional actions are currently being planned in cities such as Chicago, IL; Syracuse, NY; Portland, OR; Las Vegas, NV; and Philadelphia, PA.)

<p>NCNR promotes nonviolent opposition to the war, following the disciplines and practices of nonviolent leaders such as King and India’s Mahatma Gandhi, and is the only national anti-war campaign and network devoted exclusively to nonviolent resistance.
