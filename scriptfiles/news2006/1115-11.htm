<p>WASHINGTON - November 15 - <i>Human Rights 
Campaign President Joe Solmonese made the following statement on the 
actions of three Christian denominations yesterday speaking out on the 
lives of gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people of 
faith.&#160;</i></p>

<p>&#8220;Religious bigotry reared 
its ugly head yesterday. It&#8217;s a sad commentary that these 
religious leaders are out of step with most Americans of faith in terms 
of equality and fairness for gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender 
people of faith,&#8221; said Solmonese. &#8220;The real story is that 
more Americans of faith understand that God&#8217;s love is expansive, 
not exclusionary. In fact, church programs welcoming GLBT people are on 
the rise and have in the last year experienced a growth of between 10 
and 20 percent. That is the true story, and one that reflects a growing 
understanding among religious people that the message of Christianity is 
about love and not about isolation, exclusion and 
terror.&#8221;</p>

<p>On Tuesday, the U.S. Conference 
of Catholic Bishops voted 194-37 to approve new guidelines, 
&#8220;Ministry to Persons with a Homosexual Inclination,&#8221; that 
says gays should be told to remain celibate since the church considers 
their sexuality &#8220;disordered.&#8221; Also yesterday, the North 
Carolina Baptist State Convention adopted policies to investigate and 
expel any churches perceived to be too &#8220;gay-friendly.&#8221; And 
additionally, the Presbyterian Church (USA) will put a minister on trial 
today for conducting a marriage ceremony for a lesbian 
couple.</p>
