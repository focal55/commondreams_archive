<p>WASHINGTON - September 5 - Would you drink a Quarter Pounder with Cheese?  If you order a venti (20-oz.) Starbucks Caffè Mocha, you might as well be sipping that 500-calorie burger through a straw.  And a venti Starbucks Java Chip Frappuccino, with 650 calories and nearly a day’s saturated fat, is a McDonald’s coffee plus 11 creamers and 29 packets of sugar, according to the watchdogs at the Center for Science in the Public Interest.  In the  <a href ="http://www.cspinet.org/new/pdf/coffee.pdf ">September issue </a> of Nutrition Action Healthletter, CSPI’s nutritionists tell you how to keep your coffee break from becoming a Big Mac break.
<p>“Most people wouldn’t consider shoehorning in a Quarter Pounder with Cheese somewhere between breakfast and lunch, but it’s perfectly possible to get 500-plus calories in a drink from Starbucks,” said CSPI senior nutritionist Jayne Hurley.  “Fortunately, it’s a cinch to bring down the calories and saturated fat in many of these drinks by making a few simple changes.”
<p><b>•	Go nonfat. </b> A nonfat or soy cappuccino or latte is always a calorie bargain.  Ordering a grande (16 oz.) nonfat cappuccino or latte with nonfat milk instead of whole saves all the saturated fat plus 50 to 100 calories.  
<p><b>•	Skip the whip. </b> At Starbucks for example, whipped cream adds some 120 calories and 7 grams of saturated fat that you could do without.
<p> <b>•	Slash the sugar.  </b>Order sweetened drinks with sugar-free syrup or get them unsweetened and add your own sugar (about 10 calories per pack) or Splenda (0 calories).  
<p> <b>•	Look for “light.” </b> At Starbucks, grande Frappuccino Lights slash the calories to 150 to 250 by replacing half the sugar with Splenda and dropping the whipped cream.  A medium (14 oz.) Dunkin’ Donuts Latte Lite keeps the calories at 100.
<p>The <i>Nutrition Action Healthletter</i> article charts the calories, saturated and trans fat, sugar, and caffeine for drinks at Starbucks, Dunkin’ Donuts and other chains using company data.
<p>Like their fast-food cousins, Starbucks and other coffee sellers put nutrition numbers on their websites, but not their menu boards.  <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c109:S.3484:">Leglislation</a> that would require large chain restaurants to list calories on menu boards has been introduced in more than a dozen states, the District of Columbia, and in both Houses of Congress in the past several years.  None of those bills has become law yet, but CSPI is <a href="http://cspinet.org/new/pdf/anyone_s_guess_final_web.pdf">actively pushing</a> their adoption and is encouraging other states and cities to require calories on menu boards and expanded nutrition information on printed menus.  
<p>	The article is available at <a href="http://www.cspinet.org/new/pdf/coffee.pdf">http://www.cspinet.org/new/pdf/coffee.pdf</a>.  <i>Nutrition Action</i> is the largest-circulation health newsletter in North America, with 900,000 subscribers in the U.S. and Canada.
