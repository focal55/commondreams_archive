<p>WASHINGTON - April 17 - The House of Representatives is poised April 25 to pass a so-called ethics and lobby reform bill that fails badly to meaningfully address the still-unfolding ethics scandal in Washington. Not only is this legislation nothing more than window dressing, but it also seems to disguise ways of maintaining the status quo. 

 

<p>For example, one provision in the bill would temporarily ban privately funded travel for members of Congress, an area that has been rife with abuse. Guess when the ban expires? December. That way, Members at home campaigning get to tell constituents that they supported travel “reform,” but as soon as Congress is back in session, it’s business as usual. 

 

<p>What else is in the bill, and what is not? Why do congressional leaders want to use a gag rule to silence debate on this important issue?  

 

<p>Common Cause President Chellie Pingree, League of Women Voters President Kay J. Maxwell and PIRG Democracy Advocate Gary Kalman will address these questions and others you may have about ethics and lobby reform in Congress. The House is expected to take up this legislation after the Easter recess, on April 25.
