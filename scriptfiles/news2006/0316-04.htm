<p>NEW YORK - March 16 - The American Civil Liberties Union and the U.S. Human Rights 
Network today urged the U.N. Human Rights Committee to hold the U.S. government 
accountable for flagrant and repeated violations of the International Covenant 
on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR).&nbsp; 
<P>&#8220;Locally, nationally and globally, the United States has repeatedly failed in 
its responsibility to uphold basic human rights,&#8221; said Ann Beeson, Associate 
Legal Director of the ACLU.&nbsp; &#8220;We are appealing to the international 
arbiters to hold the U.S. accountable to basic human rights standards.&#8221;</P>
<P>The organizations convened two panels of experts and victims to discuss 
racial discrimination and human rights violations exposed by the U.S. 
government&#8217;s response to Hurricane Katrina and the U.S. government&#8217;s abuse of 
power, specifically specifically illegal electronic surveillance and the torture 
and abuse of people detained in the war on terror.&nbsp; The panels ran in 
conjunction with the 86th session of the U.N. Human Rights Committee.</P>
<P>The Committee was established to monitor the implementation of the ICCPR, a 
treaty ratified by the U.S. in 1992. It is composed of 18 independent experts 
with recognized competence in the field of human rights. The Committee meets 
three times a year for sessions of three weeks' duration, normally in March at 
United Nations headquarters in New York and in July and November at the United 
Nations Office in Geneva.&nbsp; The advocates urged the Committee to include 
questions raised at today&#8217;s sessions when they review the U.S. report to the 
body in Geneva in July.</P>
<P>The first panel discussion presented evidence of racial discrimination and 
human rights that came to light in the U.S. government&#8217;s response to Hurricane 
Katrina, including the effects on communities of color, immigrant workers, 
families and children.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>&#8220;If the fundamental rights of displaced people apply in countries far less 
able to cope with such disasters, they certainly apply here," said Ajamu Baraka, 
Executive Director of U.S. Human Rights Network.&nbsp; &#8220;We must not compound the 
plight of the displaced by letting them fend for themselves once the dust has 
settled. If we accept that it will take years to rebuild New Orleans, we must 
also accept that it will take no less time to rebuild the lives of the 
displaced.&#8221;</P>
<P>Abuse of Power: Torture and Surveillance in America was the theme of the 
second panel which covered testimony and evidence of the erosion of the rule of 
law and rights protections as exhibited by the administration&#8217;s torture, 
detention and spying policies.</P>
<P>&#8220;Since the 9/11 terrorist attacks the U.S. government has invoked national 
security and abused executive powers to violate internationally recognized human 
rights, including the absolute prohibition on torture and other cruel, inhuman 
or degrading treatment,&#8221; said Jamil Dakwar, an attorney with the ACLU Human 
Rights Working Group. &#8220;If the U.S. does not recognize its human rights 
obligations under international law, what reason do other governments have to 
uphold human rights?&#8221;</P>
<P>Last October, the U.S. submitted its second and third periodic reports to the 
U.N. Human Rights Committee which oversees the implementation of the Covenant by 
the 152 signatory member states. The U.S. report was seven years overdue and did 
not include information on U.S. conformity with the Covenant overseas; the 
government claimed the treaty does not apply beyond U.S. soil and therefore is 
not applicable to U.S. military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan.&nbsp; </P>
<P>The full review session of the U.S. report by the 18 members of the Human 
Rights Committee will take place next July in Geneva. Meanwhile, at the end of 
its New York session the Committee will publish a list of questions and issues 
to be considered at the meeting in Geneva with representatives of the U.S. 
government.<BR>&nbsp; <BR>The U.S. Human Rights Network is a coalition of more 
than 170 organizations and 300 individuals working on the full spectrum of human 
rights issues. Formed to promote U.S. adherence to universal human rights 
standards by building links between organizations across the nation, the Network 
strives to promote a human rights culture that puts those directly affected by 
human rights violations in a central leadership role. The Network also works to 
connect the U.S. human rights movement with the broader U.S. social justice 
movement and human rights movements around the world.</P>
<P>The ACLU's new Human Rights Working Group is dedicated to holding the U.S. 
government accountable to universally recognized human rights principles. The 
Human Rights Working Group is charged with incorporating international human 
rights strategies into ACLU advocacy on issues relating to national security, 
immigrants' rights, women's rights and racial justice.</P>

released photographs of the Orleans Parish Prison, is available online at: <A class=noline_blue href="http://www.aclu.org/hurricanerelief">www.aclu.org/hurricanerelief</A></P>
<P>Information about government surveillance is available online at:&nbsp;<A class=noline_blue href="http://&nbsp;www.aclu.org/spyfiles">&nbsp;www.aclu.org/spyfiles</A></P>
