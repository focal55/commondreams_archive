<p>WASHINGTON - November 9 - On Saturday, November 11, at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia, just across from Independence Hall, where the U.S. Constitution was written and signed, a coalition of national organizations and political leaders will announce plans to mobilize a national movement to impeach President Bush and Vice President Cheney. The mobilization will be called ImpeachForChange.

<p>Speakers will include Elizabeth Holtzman, former Member of Congress, served on the House panel that voted to impeach President Nixon, and author of "The Impeachment of George W. Bush: A Practical Guide for Concerned Citizens"; Cindy Sheehan, Co-Founder of Gold Star Families for Peace; David Swanson, Co-Founder of AfterDowningStreet.org and Washington Director of Democrats.com; Tim Carpenter, Director of Progressive Democrats of America; Jodie Evans, Co-Founder of CODE PINK Women for Peace; Bill Perry, Veterans for Peace; and Bob Fertik, President of Democrats.com and ImpeachPAC.org.  

<p>Representatives of other participating organizations will be present.  Participating organizations include the National Organization for Women, the Hip Hop Caucus, Constitution Summer, and many of the 200 plus organizations in the After Downing Street Coalition.

<p>The speakers will be followed by a discussion of impeachment by prominent bloggers, including Glen Ford (Black Agenda Report), Sally Hemings (Sally Hemings in Paris), Rob Kall (OpEdNews.com), Dave Lindorff (ThisCantBeHappening.net), Martin Longman (BoomanTribune.com), Susie Madrik (Suburban Guerilla), Liza Sabater (Culture Kitchen), and Bob Fertik (Democrats.com).

<p>On October 21, the Newsweek poll found 51% of Americans supporting impeachment. On October 25, the USA Today/Gallup poll found 51% of Americans supporting "major investigations" by Democrats. Much of that support comes from books, internet journalism and organizing by the speakers who will participate.
