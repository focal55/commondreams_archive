<p>WASHINGTON - November 3 - The verdict and sentencing of Saddam Hussein are scheduled to be 
announced on Sunday, November 5, just two days before the U.S. midterm 
elections. The following analysts are available for interviews:


<p>RICHARD FALK, rfalk@princeton.edu, 
<a href="http://www.transnational.org/tff/people/r_falk.html">http://www.transnational.org/tff/people/r_falk.html</a><p> Falk is an emeritus professor of international law at Princeton 
University and coauthor most recently of the book "Crimes of War: Iraq." 
He said today: "It should come as no surprise that the final verdict in 
the Saddam Hussein criminal trial seems timed to coincide with the 
November U.S. midterm elections. ...
   <p> "The U.S. government should be ashamed to have debased international 
justice by orchestrating every phase of this trial in Baghdad from start 
to finish to divert domestic public opinion in this country from the 
dismal failure of its Iraq policy. It is a sad day for American 
democracy if the citizens of this country fall for such a cheap 
propaganda trick amid a dreadful war that is wasting the lives of its 
young soldiers and bringing massive suffering to the Iraqi people."

<p>SUREYA SAYADI, MD, drpeacess@yahoo.com, <a href="http://www.peacepalpitations.com">http://www.peacepalpitations.com</a><p>  A Kurdish doctor and academic now living in the U.S., Sayadi said 
today: "I've been watching the trial very closely -- the Kurdish 
channels on satellite TV show it late night. Hearing the stories from 
the victims, how they were blinded, how their families were killed is 
just heartbreaking. But now the U.S. government is using these people's 
death and suffering for an election. Since the 1970s, the U.S. 
government has played with Kurdish lives. They are playing with Iraqi 
lives and now they're even playing with American lives.
<p>  She added: "The trial is supposed to show justice, but it doesn't. 
It doesn't examine who gave Saddam the chemical and biological agents to 
kill people -- it was the U.S. and Germany. If we were really after 
justice, there would be an international tribunal, like for Rwanda. 
Instead, the U.S. government just wants to use the trial of Saddam to 
continue its policies in Iraq today. I don't know whether to laugh or cry."
