<p>BERLIN - January 11 - Greenpeace today, joined by a former 
manager of Monsanto and Limagrain in Romania, Mr Dragos Dima, at a press 
conference at the International Green Week in Berlin exposed how 
Monsanto will contaminate EU agriculture with genetically engineered 
(GE) Soya. U.S. biotech giant made an application in December 2005 to 
the European Union to grow its genetically engineered (GE) 'Roundup 
Ready' soybeans across the whole of Europe once its current licence - 
permitting the beans' import but not cultivation - expires in 2006 (1).

<p>"Ten years after the introduction of Monsanto's GE Soya into the 
environment and our food, we have collected enough data from around the 
world to be able to say that this product should have never been 
approved in the first place. Recent Greenpeace research in Romania has 
exposed the fact that since the company has introduced GE Soya; things 
have gone totally out of control. European member states should avoid 
Romania's example, protect European agriculture and oppose Monsanto's 
application," says Susanne Fromwald from Greenpeace Central and Eastern 
Europe.

<p>A new Greenpeace report reveals that the GE Soya crop in Romania covers 
more hectares than are officially registered.  Due to illegal 
cultivation and uncontrollable contamination, conventional and organic 
farming is now impossible in many regions.

<p>"Transgenic seeds are a poisoned promise. Romania did not have any 
scientific and public debate prior to the commercial introduction. 
Neither the authorities, nor the companies applied the precautionary 
principle in assessing the impact of these crops in agriculture. Year 
after year, the acreage of the herbicide resistant soybeans increased 
uncontrollably," stated Mr Dima, who left Monsanto in 1999, when the GE 
soybeans were first introduced in Romania.

<p>Romanian Government officials, reacting to Greenpeace's findings, 
announced that the cultivation of GE crops should be reduced in 2006 and 
phased out completely by 2007, when it is due to join the EU. However, 
Monsanto filing an application for the whole of Europe now would 
effectively prevent Romania ridding itself of GE crops and GE 
contamination.
 
<p>Experience in Argentina and the United States has showed the cultivation 
of Monsanto´s GE soybeans contaminates conventional and organic 
agriculture. Furthermore, it has been reported that the cultivation of 
these crops often leads to the increased use of pesticides. Increasing 
rain forest destruction, especially in Argentina, is also closely 
related to the expansion of GE soy planting (2). Recent research also 
shows irregularities of the introduced genetic construct, which could 
cause unintended effects in these crops (3). Some alarming health 
signals were reported after feeding trials with mice (4).

<p>Greenpeace opposes the release of GE Soya into the environment and the 
food chain and is asking the European member states to reject Monsanto's 
application.

<p>Greenpeace is an independent, campaigning organisation, which uses 
non-violent, creative confrontation to expose global environmental 
problems, and to force solutions essential to a green and peaceful future.
