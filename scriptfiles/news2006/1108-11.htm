<p>WASHINGTON - November 8 - I<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">n 
        the wake of the Republican party losing control of the U.S. House and 
        amidst key Senate losses, the National Rifle Association (NRA) has suffered 
        its “biggest election disaster in nearly 15 years” according to the NRA’s 
        own election materials. In its magazines and in member communications 
        leading up to the 2006 midterm elections, the NRA repeatedly warned that 
        its “pro-Second Amendment House of Representatives” was at stake. And 
        in a direct-mail appeal sent out in July 2006, the NRA’s Political Victory 
        Fund declared that “you and I could be headed for our biggest election 
        disaster in nearly 15 years” if Democrats were to take control of one 
        or both Houses of Congress. </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the wake of the 
        NRA’s electoral defeat, Violence Policy Center Legislative Director Kristen 
        Rand states, “The gun lobby’s foot soldiers went AWOL in this election.” 
        </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The November 2006 
        pre-election <a href="../graphics/1stfreedomnov06.jpg">“Choose or Lose” 
        edition</a> of the NRA’s “America’s 1st Freedom” magazine admonished members 
        that, “Our recent victories and future legislative objectives are at risk 
        this Election Day if gun owners don’t rally and go to the polls to support 
        the true friends of the Second Amendment.” The magazine amounted to little 
        more than a 64-page attack on Democrats, with a particular focus on House 
        Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and Democratic Senatorial Campaign 
        Committee head Charles Schumer (D-NY). In the publication, NRA President 
        Sandra S. Froman warned, "We are at war. Our freedom is at stake. The 
        Second Amendment is America's original homeland security and you, my fellow 
        NRA members, are at the heart of our national defense. But Pelosi and 
        her fellow extremists, who are hoping to take control, oppose our national 
        security efforts and oppose your Right to Keep and Bear Arms....Those 
        who would seize power on Nov. 7 are unrelenting opponents of your values 
        and beliefs...." </font> 
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The gun lobby’s allegiance 
        to Republicans shows in its political giving. In 2006, the NRA’s PAC gave 
        85 percent of its campaign contributions to Republican candidates while 
        Gun Owners of America gave 100 percent to Republicans. In addition, Republican 
        activists Grover Norquist, David Keene, and Ollie North serve on the NRA’s 
        board of directors in addition to current and former Republican Members 
        of Congress. </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Just one week before 
        the November 7th election, NRA Executive Vice President Wayne LaPierre 
        summed up the urgency of the situation in an “exclusive” interview with 
        the pro-gun publication “The New Gun Week.” Warned LaPierre, “Gunowners 
        need to get to the polls because the battle lines are drawn....[W]e need 
        to erect a barricade to protect the Second Amendment from the handgun 
        control crowd....They want to unleash the ATF [Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, 
        Firearms and Explosives] on every law-abiding gunowner in America.” </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In addition to the 
        House turnover, NRA-backed Senate candidates also lost in key races including 
        Rick Santorum (R-PA), Jim Talent (R-MO), Mike Bouchard (R-MI), and Michael 
        Steele (R-MD). In the two Senate races still too close to call, the NRA 
        backed Republicans George Allen in Virginia and Conrad Burns in Montana.
