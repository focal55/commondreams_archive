<p>WASHINGTON - September 5 - At a rally today at the Cannon House Office Building of the U.S. Capitol, supporters of federal legislation to end the slaughter of America's horses pressed for passage of H.R. 503, the American Horse Slaughter Prevention Act, scheduled for a House vote as early as Thursday.&nbsp; The bill has been introduced by U.S. Representatives John Sweeney (R-N.Y.), John Spratt (D-S.C.), Ed Whitfield (R-Ky.), and Nick Rahall (D-W. Va.).</P>
<P>Representative Whitfield was on hand for the rally and urged humane-minded Americans to call or write their elected officials to urge them to give approval to the legislation. </P>
<P>"Although the majority of people in America clearly support federal legislation to prohibit horse slaughter, it has been particularly difficult to overcome the opposition of a few congressional leaders. We must not squander our opportunity to pass H R 503 on September 7."</P>
<P>Wayne Pacelle, president and CEO of The Humane Society of the United States, urged Congress to bring an end once and for all to the practice of horse slaughter.</P>
<P>"Killing horses for export for human consumption is unnecessary and inhumane, and it is long overdue that the Congress put an end to this practice," Pacelle said. "Horse slaughter is not a question of property rights, but a matter of personal responsibility and public standards in the care of animals." </P>
<P>Other rally participants included Eddie Kilroy, host of XM Radio's "Willie's Place;" Nelly McKay, critically acclaimed performer and animal advocate; Amy Nelson, daughter of country music legend Willie Nelson; and Sky Dutcher, whose horse was stolen on the girl's 12th birthday and ultimately sent to slaughter.</P>
<P>Last year, the House and Senate overwhelmingly passed amendments to halt horse slaughter by de-funding inspections at slaughterhouses. &nbsp;But the U.S. Department of Agriculture side-stepped the new law to allow the three foreign-owned slaughterhouses to continue operating in the United States. H.R. 503 would establish a permanent ban on horse slaughter.</P>
<P>With the vote around the corner, opponents of the ban have stepped up efforts to confuse the issue by the untenable argument that the slaughter industry somehow benefits horses. </P>
<P>"It is hard to believe that the slaughter industry and its paid lobbyists can keep a straight face when they make the argument that they are helping horses by transporting them in cattle trucks, prodding them on to the kill floor, and then slaughtering them," Pacelle added.&nbsp;"But the American public and a majority of elected officials can see through their charade.&nbsp;I am confident the House will vote to halt this cruelty on Thursday."</P>
