<p>WASHINGTON - May 4 - Right-wing radio  host Glenn Beck is set to host a one-hour talk show as  part of CNN Headline News' prime-time programming,  beginning May 8. Media Matters for America has  previously condemned CNN's decision to hire Beck and now  offers a compilation of recent outrageous statements  made by Beck:</p>
<p>   -- On antiwar protestor Cindy Sheehan: &quot;That's a  pretty big prostitute.&quot;</p>
<p>   -- Also on Cindy Sheehan: She is &quot;pimping out the  tragedy of her own son's death for her own agenda.&quot;</p>
<p>   -- On former President Jimmy Carter: &quot;Is there a  bigger waste of skin than Jimmy Carter?&quot;</p>
<p>   -- On a Nigerian public information campaign to fight  bird flu: &quot;They've actually resorted to radio jingles.  ... Are we as dumb as Nigeria?&quot;</p>
<p>   -- To the 7-year old African-American author of a  controversial poem: &quot;You want to go to Africa? I will  personally purchase your airfare.&quot;</p>
<p>   -- On immigration protests: Mexico &quot;is a country that  has been overtaken by lawbreakers from the bottom to the  top. And now, what you're protesting for is to have  lawbreakers come here.&quot;</p>
<p>   -- Responding to criticism of his remarks on  immigration protests: &quot;(I) pretty much stand by&quot; the  assertion that &quot;Mexico is run by nothing but criminals.&quot;</p>
<p>   -- On American Indians in South Dakota considering  skirting a state ban on abortion: They &quot;will have found  something that can be more profitable than casinos, and  that's abortion clinics.&quot;</p>
<p>   -- Suggesting &quot;politically correct&quot; names for bunker- buster nuclear weapons: &quot;(B)utterfly bomb,&quot; &quot;climate- control device,&quot; &quot;(b)omb de tropical. ... We could use  that one in Venezuela.&quot;</p>
<p>   -- On immigrants entering illegally from Mexico:  Either &quot;they're terrorists,&quot; &quot;they're escaping the law,&quot;  or &quot;(t)hey can't make a living in their own dirtbag  country.</p>
<p>   &quot;CNN's decision to hire an unapologetic preacher of  hate signals a desperate and misguided ploy for ratings  without regard for the thousands of Americans Beck has  offended with his malicious commentary,&quot; said David  Brock, President and CEO of Media Matters for America.</p>
