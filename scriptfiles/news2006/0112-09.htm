<p>WASHINGTON - January 12 - Nancy Keenan, president  of NARAL Pro-Choice America, said that Samuel Alito concluded his  portion of the hearings on his nomination for the Supreme Court  without answering questions on fundamental issues regarding  individual freedom and privacy.</p>
<p>   "Samuel Alito consistently refused to answer thoughtful, fair  questions on whether he supports the values of freedom of privacy  for women as guaranteed by Roe v. Wade. Alito confirmed that in  1985 he endorsed a legal philosophy that the Constitution does  not protect the right to choose, but refused to state his current  legal and judicial philosophy on the issue. He said nothing this  week to lead Americans to believe that he still doesn't hold  these views," Keenan said. "As he evaded Roe-related questions  from multiple senators, Alito gave full answers to questions on  other legal issues and cited some as settled law. But Alito  steadfastly refused to acknowledge Roe as settled law and even  mischaracterized the constitutional foundation of important  reproductive rights cases. It is clear that Americans who value  freedom and privacy cannot support confirming him to a lifetime  position on the Supreme Court."</p>
<p>   NARAL Pro-Choice America produced response materials regarding  Alito's answers to questions related to Roe v. Wade and the right  to privacy. These reports are available at the links below:</p>
