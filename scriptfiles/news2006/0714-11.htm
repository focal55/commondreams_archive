<p>ST. PETERSBURG, Russia - July 14 - One year on from the previous G8 Summit in Gleneagles (UK), leaders have not met their promises on aid, education and HIV and AIDS. 
<p>This is the main conclusion of the <A 
href="http://www.actionaid.org/wps/content_document.asp?doc_id=563" target="_new" class=textonly>briefing launched today </A>by the international development agency ActionAid in St Petersburg where the world&rsquo;s richest leaders are meeting until Monday. Only on debt relief did the G8 deliver what they promised. 
<p>As G8 leaders gather round the table in St. Petersburg tomorrow, ActionAid examines whether the G8 is on track to achieve its targets on aid, identifying what it must do to accelerate progress in areas where it is falling short.

<p><b>More and Better Aid?</b>

<p>At Gleneagles, the G8 countries promised to double aid to Africa as part of an extra $50 billion package by 2010, and take immediate action on better aid. Currently they’re not on track to achieve this target, with the countries that need to do most currently doing the least. On key aspects of aid, donors are failing to reform. 

<p><b>Universal AIDS Treatment?</b>

<p>The G8 pledged to achieve universal access to treatment by 2010. Donors are failing to back the pledge with sufficient money, leaving an annual funding gap of at least $10 billion a year.

<p><b>Education For All?</b>

<p>The G8 promised to help put every child in school within ten years. But so far G8 countries have not contributed enough money to meet this target.· 

<p>“As ActionAid Chief Executive Officer, Ramesh Singh made clear to Vladimir Putin when he met him last week during the civil society forum, G8 members have to respond to why they were unable to meet these promises and each produce a detailed timetable for meeting their share of the extra $50 billion in global aid, setting out how they will change their policies to ensure developing countries can choose their own development paths, free from harmful G8 conditions.” says Patrick Watt, ActionAid UK policy coordinator.

<p>“If Putin and the G8 leaders are serious about fighting communicable diseases and promoting education for all as the agenda suggests, they must set out a funding plan to show where the money will come from and each commit new money to fund progress towards education for all,” says Moussa Faye, ActionAid trade advisor and country representative in Senegal.
