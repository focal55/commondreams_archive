<p>WASHINGTON - May 25 - On Thursday, May 25, the Straus Military Reform Project will sponsor two short presentations by retired Army Col. Douglas Macgregor and&nbsp; retired Air Force Col. Chester Richards on the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.&nbsp; Both will present differing arguments on how and why the wars, especially in Iraq, have been going so badly for so long, if – indeed – they have not been lost for quite some time.
<P>At this presentation, Project Director Winslow Wheeler will also make available copies of a dramatic new article (unpublished until now) by Macgregor on professional incompetence and serious ethical failures on the part of senior Army commanders: a characterization in sharp contrast to the recent lionization in some press accounts of some of these commanders because of their late and self-serving – but also very much called for – criticisms of Secretary of Defense DOnald Rumsfeld.&nbsp; Copies of Richards' new monograph on 4th generation warfare, <EM>Neither Shall the Sword</EM>, will also be available.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>These presentations (10 to 20 minutes each) will take place starting at 10:00 in the Butler Room (first floor) in the Carnegie Building at 1779 Massachusetts Ave., NW (very close to the DuPont Circle/Red Line Metro stop).&nbsp; Coffee and Coke will be available.</P>
<P>Macgregor is a former Army Colonel and a decorated Gulf War combat veteran. He is the author of <EM>Transformation Under Fire</EM> (Praeger, 1993), <EM>Breaking the Phalanx: A New Design for Landpower in the 21st Century</EM>, (Praeger, 1997), and <EM>The Soviet-East German Military Alliance </EM>(Cambridge University Press, 1989). His newest work, <EM>Character under Fire: The Battle of 73 Easting</EM>, will be appear later this year. </P>
<P>Richards is a retired intelligence and middle east specialist.&nbsp; He is the author of <EM>Certain to Win</EM> (applying the thinking of American strategist John Boyd to the private sector), and <EM>Swift Elusive Sword</EM> (about 3rd generation warfare), in addition to <EM>Neither Shall the Sword </EM>(about 4th generation warfare).&nbsp; Each is published by CDI.</P>
<P>Due to space limitations, RSVPs are required if you plan to attend: <A href="mailto:winslowwheeler@comcast.net">winslowwheeler@comcast.net</A>.</P>
