<p>WASHINGTON - January 3 - The AFL-CIO and the
United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW) today sued the U.S. Department of
Labor over its failure to issue a standard requiring employers to pay for
personal protective equipment (PPE) -- a standard which has been delayed
for nearly eight years. This Occupational Safety and Health Administration
(OSHA) rule would require employers to pay the costs of protective
clothing, lifelines, face shields, gloves and other equipment used by an
estimated 20 million workers to protect them from job hazards.
  <p>  The lawsuit asserts that the Bush Administration's failure to act is
putting workers in danger. By OSHA's own estimates, 400,000 workers have
been injured and 50 have died due to the absence of this rule. The labor
groups say that workers in some of America's most dangerous industries,
such as meatpacking, poultry and construction, and low-wage and immigrant
workers who suffer high injury rates, are vulnerable to being forced by
their employers to pay for their own safety gear because of OSHA's failure
to finish the PPE rule.
   <p> The rule was first announced in 1997 and proposed in 1999 by the
Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) after a ruling by the
Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission that OSHA's existing PPE
standard could not be interpreted to require employers to pay for
protective equipment. The new rule would not impose any new obligations on
employers to provide safety equipment; it simply codifies OSHA's
longstanding policy that employers, not employees, have the responsibility
to pay for it.
   <p> In 1999, OSHA promised to issue the final PPE rule in July 2000. But it
missed that deadline and has missed every self-imposed deadline since. The
agency has failed to act in response to a 2003 petition by the AFL-CIO and
UFCW and numerous requests by the Hispanic Congressional Caucus. The
lawsuit filed today seeks to end this eight-year delay, calling it
"egregious."
   <p> "Nothing is standing in the way of OSHA issuing a final PPE rule to
protect worker safety and health except the will to do so. It is long
overdue that the agency take action on protective equipment. Now, we are
asking the courts to force OSHA to act," said Joseph Hansen, UFCW
International President.
   <p> "The Bush Administration's failure to implement even this most basic
safety rule spotlights how it has turned its back on workers in this
country," said AFL-CIO President John Sweeney. "Too many workers have
already been hurt or killed. The Bush Department of Labor should stop
looking out for corporate interests at the expense of workers' safety and
health on the job."
  <p>  The lawsuit, filed in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of
Columbia Circuit, asks the court to issue an order directing the Secretary
of Labor to complete the PPE rule within 60 days of the court's order.<!-- #EndEditable -->
