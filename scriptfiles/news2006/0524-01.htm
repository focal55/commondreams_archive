<p>WASHINGTON - May 24 - As top sportswear brands  prepare to showcase their newest products at this year's FIFA World  Cup in Germany, many workers who make the products are facing  intimidation or dismissal for attempting to unionize, according to a  report released today by Oxfam International.</p>
<p>   Oxfam's report, Offside! Labor Rights and Sportswear Production  in Asia, found that workers making clothes, shoes and other goods  for global sports brands have been fired or threatened with violence  when they have organized unions to lobby for better pay and  conditions. The majority of Asian sportswear workers are women from  poor communities, many supporting children and families. Oxfam said  that none of the big sports brands are doing enough to solve the  problem.</p>
<p>   &quot;In 2004 the Play Fair Alliance—including Oxfam, the Clean  Clothes Campaign and global unions—challenged the industry to  improve labor conditions, but sadly little has changed. Workers'  right to form unions is crucial to achieving the big improvements  needed on the factory floor but many brands are still not willing to  play ball,&quot; says Kelly Dent, Oxfam International spokesperson and  the report's co-author.</p>
<p>   Oxfam's year-long survey of 12 sportswear labels found that U.S.- based FILA was at the bottom of the league and had failed to address  serious labor abuses in its supply chain. In one case, a FILA sport  shoe supplier in Indonesia with an appalling record of worker abuse  closed suddenly and without warning. A year later, none of its 3,500  workers have received any back-pay or severance pay. FILA refuses to  reveal its role in the closure or take responsibility for the  workers.</p>
<p>   &quot;Unless workers are free to bargain collectively for better pay  and conditions, companies like FILA will continue to get away with  this kind of outrageous behavior. Professional soccer players are  represented by players' associations, sportswear workers should be  allowed to form unions too,&quot; Dent said.</p>
<p>   Oxfam says that Reebok has done the most to uphold workers'  rights in Asia, while other big brands such as Nike, adidas, Puma  and Asics had made some improvements. However, the performance of  the industry as a whole remains poor.</p>
<p>   For example, an adidas supplier in Indonesia where workers  receive as little as 60 cents an hour for their labor recently  terminated 30 union workers who took part in a legal strike for more  pay. The Panarub factory near Jakarta makes the adidas' Predator  Pulse shoes promoted by England's David Beckham and Frank Lampard,  France's Zinedine Zidane and Patrick Viera, Spain's Raul and  Brazil's Kaka. The factory also makes the +F50.6 Tunit shoes  promoted by Holland's Arjen Robben, Germany's Kevin Kuranyi and  Brazil's Ze Roberto in the lead up to the FIFA World Cup. However,  adidas has refused to help the 30 fired workers get their jobs back.</p>
<p>   &quot;The firing of these workers sends a very worrying signal to  sports brands -- that it's acceptable to discriminate against union  workers. In the past, adidas has shown leadership within the  industry and the company should continue to do so by ensuring the  factory reinstates these workers,&quot; Dent said.</p>
<p>   &quot;The sportswear industry is a valuable source of jobs in Asia.  But consumers and workers alike have the right to expect that global  brands will not exploit the people making their goods,&quot; concluded  Dent.</p>
