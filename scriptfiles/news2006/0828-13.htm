<p>WASHINGTON - August 28 - Amnesty International today warned that the build-up of Sudanese troops in Darfur could lead to a human rights catastrophe in the very near future, and urged the UN Security Council to take immediate action to protect the people of the region.<br>
<br>
&quot;Eyewitnesses in al-Fasher in North Darfur are telling us that Sudanese government military flights are flying in troops and arms on a daily basis,&quot; said Kate Gilmore, Amnesty International's Executive Deputy Secretary General. &quot;Displaced people in Darfur are absolutely terrified that the same soldiers that expelled them from their homes and villages may now be sent supposedly to protect them.&quot;<br>
<br>
The organization urged the UN Security Council to exert maximum pressure on Sudan  to accept UN peacekeeping troops in Darfur --  including imposing further targeted sanctions against Sudanese authorities.<br>
<br>
The Security Council is due to meet today to discuss a draft resolution on the crisis in Darfur.<br>
<br>
The Sudanese government has proposed its own protection plan for the people of Darfur -- a plan that reportedly involves bringing up to 26,000 government troops into the region.  <br>
<br>
&quot;The Sudanese government's 'protection plan' is a sham and must be firmly rejected,&quot; said Kate Gilmore. &quot;How can Sudan -- which appears to be about to launch its own offensive in Darfur -- realistically propose being a peacekeeper in a conflict to which it is a major party and perpetrator of grave human rights violations?&quot; <br>
<br>
On 29 July, the Sudanese government bombed villages in North Darfur, violating a March 2005 UN Security Council resolution banning offensive flights in Darfur. Armed opposition groups have also perpetrated grave human rights abuses, including attacking humanitarian convoys.
