<p>WASHINGTON - August 18 - Amnesty International  is alarmed that escalating fighting in Sri Lanka has resulted in  the death and injury of scores of civilians, the displacement of  more than 160,000 people, and the destruction of homes, schools,  and places of worship. The organization is dismayed that neither  the government security forces nor the Liberation Tigers of Tamil  Eelam (LTTE) appear to be taking adequate precautions to protect  civilian lives. Even when serious violations of international  humanitarian law are reported, both sides trade accusations and  counter-accusations rather than take steps to address or put a  halt to violations.</p>
<p>   &quot;The organization is concerned by the extent and seriousness  of the violations reported, the lack of adequate protection for  civilians, and restrictions on access to the worst affected  areas,&quot; said Jim McDonald, Amnesty International USA's Sri Lanka  Country Specialist. &quot;Persistent uncertainty about what has  actually occurred and who is responsible for alleged war crimes  and other violations of international law are fueling fear and  panic among the civilian population.&quot;</p>
<p>   This past June, Amnesty International issued a report, Sri  Lanka: Waiting to Go Home –- The Plight of the Internally  Displaced, describing how as insecurity increases, people who  have been displaced several times are being forced to move again.  Many have been unable to return home for decades and the increase  in military activity is a major barrier preventing them from  resettling and rebuilding their lives. A total of 39,883 people  have been displaced in the north and east of Sri Lanka since  April 2006, according to United Nation figures.</p>
<p>   Amnesty International believes that the establishment of a  strong and effective international human rights monitoring  operation is urgently needed to respond to the dramatic  deterioration of the human rights and humanitarian situation.  Such a monitoring mission must have the full cooperation of both  the government of Sri Lanka and the LTTE, and the support of the  United Nations and its member states.</p>
<p>   Recent incidents recorded by Amnesty International that demand  further investigation by independent human rights experts  include:</p>
<p>   -- On August 3, at least 17 civilians, including children,  were killed and 80 injured when four schools in Muttur were hit  by shelling, according to reports.</p>
<p>   -- On August 6, the bodies of 15 aid workers with the French  aid agency Action Against Hunger (Action Contre la Faim, or ACF)  were discovered lying face-down on the front lawn of ACF's Muttur  office, with bullet wounds indicating that they had been shot at  close range. The bodies of two more staff members were found on 8  August in a car nearby, indicating that they may have been killed  while trying to escape. The government has invited an Australian  forensic expert to assist with the investigation, but has  prevented international truce monitors from visiting the site.</p>
<p>   -- On August 10, renewed aerial bombardment by the Sri Lankan  air force of LTTE-controlled areas in Trincomalee district  reportedly resulted in a number of civilian casualties. The LTTE  claimed that at least 50 civilians were killed and more than 200  wounded in aerial attacks on populated areas. A military  spokesman told the Associated Press news agency that the army  does not target civilians but added that the LTTE were &quot;known for  using human shields and they placed their gun positions around  civilian villages.&quot;  Casualty figures and competing accounts of  the bombardment could not be independently verified.</p>
<p>   -- On August 14, as many as 51 teenage girls were reportedly  killed and more than 100 wounded when Sri Lankan air forces  dropped between 12 to 16 bombs on a compound in the northern  district of Mullaitivu, in LTTE-controlled territory. UNICEF  reported that the victims had come from various schools in  Mullaitivu and Kilinochchi districts to attend course in first  aid. The Sri Lanka Monitoring Mission, an international team of  experts charged with monitoring the compliance of both parties  with the 2002 ceasefire agreement, said the target of the air  strikes was a former orphanage with no evidence of military  installations or weapons nearby. A national security spokesperson  said the air force had conducted air strikes on an LTTE training  base at Puthukudiyurippu in Mullaitivu, and that &quot;between 50 and  60 young LTTE terrorist cadres were killed and many were  injured.&quot;</p>
<p>   There also have been a series of attacks in the capital,  Colombo, the nature and targets of which strongly suggest the  involvement of the LTTE.</p>
<p>   -- On August 8, a car bomb attack on S. Sivathasan, a senior  member of the Eelam People's Democratic Party and former Member  of Parliament, killed the politician's bodyguard and a three- year-old child who happened to be standing near the roadside. S.  Sivathasan and five other civilians were injured in the blast.</p>
<p>   -- On August 12, unidentified gunmen assassinated Ketheshwaran  Loganathan, the deputy secretary general of the government's  Secretariat for Coordinating the Peace Process (SCOPP) and former  director of the Colombo-based Centre for Policy Alternatives, a  research centre that specializes in conflict resolution and good  governance.</p>
<p>   -- On August 14, a bomb hit a convoy carrying the Pakistan's  High Commissioner Bashir Wali Mohamed; the ambassador escaped  without injury, but at least seven people were killed in the  blast including four military bodyguards and three civilian  bystanders.</p>
<p>   Amnesty International appeals to both the government and the  LTTE to comply with international humanitarian law, which  prohibits murder or other violence to those taking no active part  in hostilities. As a matter of urgency, both parties to the  conflict must ensure that their forces comply with the principle  of distinction between civilian and military targets and do not  target civilians or carry out indiscriminate attacks.</p>
