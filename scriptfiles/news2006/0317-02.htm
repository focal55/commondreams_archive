<p>PARIS - March 17 - "Ignore the Bush Administration's apparent 
reckless intent to ravage the planet," says Greenpeace today as experts 
attend an urgently convened meeting on World Heritage and climate 
change. Greenpeace called on the experts to ignore a challenge from the 
Administration and continue with its deliberations and subsequent 
recommendations on protecting listed sites from the dangers posed by 
climate change.

<p>Today's meeting in Paris follows the decision to hold an investigation, 
which was agreed at a meeting of the United Nations Educational, 
Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) last year after 
petitioning by campaigners and lawyers. However a recent submission from 
the United States suggests that it is an inappropriate discussion for 
World Heritage and warns that if the Committee addresses the issue of 
global climate change it risks 'losing the unified spirit and 
camaraderie that has become synonymous with World Heritage.1'

<p>"The United States has a history of trying to stifle the climate change 
debate in any and all fora and that's exactly what it is trying to do 
here," said Laetitia de Marez, Greenpeace France Climate & Energy 
Campaigner. "It also once again deploys the defunct argument that there 
is not enough evidence to prove that climate change is caused by humans, 
therefore there is no proof that humans can do anything about it under 
the World Heritage Convention."

<p>Greenpeace is petitioning the World Heritage Committee, along with other 
organizations, to list both the Great Barrier Reef in Australia and the 
Waterton-Glacier International Peace Park in the United States and 
Canada as they are in danger due to the damage caused by climate change2.

<p>"There is no doubt that these sites and many others are being damaged by 
climate change to the extent that they may eventually lose the 
characteristics that made them Heritage sites in the first place," said 
De Marez. "In the Glacier National Park, for instance, only 27 glaciers 
remain out of 150 and those are rapidly melting".

<p>"It is completely appropriate for World Heritage to discuss this issue 
and we hope that the meeting will recommend that State Parties should 
take responsibility for reducing greenhouse gas emissions as part of its 
strategy for protecting and preserving heritage sites around the world," 
concluded De Marez.

<p>The World Heritage Committee will discuss the report by the expert 
working group in July, 2006.
