<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON - November 2 - Business owners, executives and venture capitalists around the nation -- 
including the states where minimum wage is on the ballot Nov. 7 -- are calling 
for a higher minimum wage to pay workers fairly, boost business and strengthen 
the economy.<BR>
<BR>
The statement released today calls for raising the wage 
floor above $5.15 an hour, noting, "Minimum wage workers have less buying power 
than minimum wage workers had half a century ago. We cannot build a strong 21st 
century economy on a 1950s' wage floor."<BR>
<BR>
"As a productivity adviser to 
major retailers, I've witnessed how inadequate wages can create a vicious cycle 
of high turnover and low productivity, which is bad for workers and businesses," says Paul Lightfoot, CEO of AL Systems Inc.<BR>
<BR>
INAUGURAL SIGNERS include 
Eileen Fisher, chief creative officer, women's apparel company Eileen Fisher ~~ 
Arnold Hiatt, former CEO, Stride Rite ~~ Robert Glassman, chair, Wainwright Bank 
~~ Deborah Nelson, executive director, Social Venture Network ~~ Jeffrey 
Hollender, president, Seventh Generation, the leading brand of non-toxic 
household products ~~ Peter Strugatz, CEO, IceStone ~~ Jeff Milchen, co-founder, 
American Independent Business Alliance ~~ Rink Dickinson, president, Equal 
Exchange, the nation's largest for-profit fair trade company ~~ Peter Barnes, 
co-founder, Working Assets ~~ Doug Hammond, president, Relief Resources and 
co-founder, Business Alliance for Local Living Economies.<BR>
<BR>
Signers from 
states with a minimum wage increase on the ballot include:<BR>
<BR>
OHIO: Adnan 
Durrani, president of Condor Ventures and venture partner, Blue Chip Venture 
Capital, Cincinnati.<BR>
Mr. Darrani says, "I have found that without exception 
in the successful ventures we've backed, providing sustainable living wages 
yielded direct increases in productivity, job satisfaction and especially brand 
loyalty from customers, thus contributing to higher returns for investors/ 
shareholders, employees and vendors."<BR>
<BR>
ARIZONA: Rick Keefe, president of 
R-Galaxy, Tucson.<BR>
Mr. Keefe says, "Raising the minimum wage is vital because 
it enriches our entire community, by giving purchasing power to working people 
who deserve it for their hard day's work."<BR>
<BR>
COLORADO: Marilyn Megenity, 
owner of the Mercury Cafe, Denver.<BR>
Ms. Megenity says, "Workers deserve a 
living wage to allow them to participate in the economy with 
dignity."<BR>
<BR>
MISSOURI: Lew Prince, co-owner of Vintage Vinyl, St. 
Louis.<BR>
Mr. Prince comments, "To business owners I say, take a look at who 
walks in the door and see if putting an extra $200 a week in the pockets of 10 
percent of them is good for your business."<BR>
<BR>
MONTANA: Shalon Hastings, 
owner of Taco del Sol, Helena.<BR>
Ms. Hastings says, "We're overdue for a 
minimum wage increase. It's a sign of respect for our employees and the work 
they do for us as business owners."<BR>
<BR>
"Investing in employees is the single 
most important investment that a company can make," says Brian Smith, managing 
partner of the Blackfoot River Brewing Company in Helena, MT.<BR>
<BR>
Arnold 
Hiatt, former CEO of Stride Rite, explains, "In order to create a better 
tomorrow, we've got to plan responsibly today. Increasing the minimum wage will 
help the United States create a future with a stable workforce and a strong 
economy."<BR>
<BR>
The Business Owners and Executives for a Higher Minimum Wage 
statement appears below, along with inaugural signatories. Sign-ons are 
continuing through Let Justice Roll, a national partnership of more than 80 
organizations working for a higher minimum wage, at 
http://www.letjusticeroll.org/business-signup.html.<BR>

<BR>
BUSINESS 
OWNERS AND EXECUTIVES FOR A HIGHER MINIMUM WAGE<BR>
<BR>
We, the undersigned 
business owners and executives, support an increase in the minimum wage to 
benefit workers, business and our economy. We know that a minimum wage of $5.15 
an hour is simply not enough for workers to afford necessities for themselves 
and their families. We know that a fair wage floor is essential to healthy 
businesses and communities, and enduring economic growth.<BR>
<BR>
We expect an 
increased minimum wage to provide a boost to local economies. Businesses and 
communities will benefit as low-wage workers spend their much-needed pay raises 
at businesses in the neighborhoods where they live and work.<BR>
<BR>
Higher wages 
benefit business by increasing consumer purchasing power, reducing costly 
employee turnover, raising productivity, and improving product quality, customer 
satisfaction and company reputation. In a recent National Consumers League 
survey, for example, 76 percent of American consumers said "how well a company 
treats/pays employees influences what they buy."<BR>
<BR>
States that have raised 
their minimum wages above the inadequate $5.15 federal level have had better 
employment and small business trends than the other states. Studies by the 
Fiscal Policy Institute and others show that in states with minimum wages above 
$5.15, the number of small businesses and the number of small business employees 
grew more than the other states -- contrary to what critics predicted. Likewise, 
after the last federal minimum wage increases in 1996 and 1997, the nation 
experienced lower unemployment, low inflation, robust growth and declining 
poverty rates.<BR>
<BR>
At $5.15 an hour, today's minimum wage workers have less 
buying power than minimum wage workers had half a century ago. We cannot build a 
strong 21st century economy on a 1950s' wage floor. We cannot build a strong 
21st century economy when more and more hardworking Americans struggle to make 
ends meet.<BR>
<BR>
A fair minimum wage shows we value both work and responsible 
businesses. A fair minimum wage is a sound investment in the future of our 
communities and our nation.<BR>
