<p>WASHINGTON - March 3 - 
<p><b><a href="mailto:aweiss@uoregon.edu">ANITA WEISS</a></b><br />
Co-editor of the book <i>Power and Civil Society in Pakistan</i> and professor of international studies at the University of Oregon, Weiss said today: "It's not clear if the bombing of the Marriott hotel was to protest Bush's visit or if it was more agitation over the cartoon issue, which is really a proxy for dissatisfaction with Musharraf's relationship with the U.S. and the West regardless. ... An interesting thing to look for: which Pakistani politicians will publicly be seen meeting with Bush? Since there's been a powerful alliance against Musharraf (allegedly over the cartoon issue) in the past weeks, I wonder how many of them will show up in photos with Bush. Few, I would think. The unfortunate thing about the timing of Bush's visit is that I fear it will serve to strengthen the political appeal of the Islamist parties."<br />

A physicist, Faheem recently retired from the International Center for Theoretical Physics in Italy. He is in Islamabad and can address U.S.-Pakistani relations and U.S. policy in the region, including nuclear policy. He said today: "Bush talks about fostering democracy, but Musharraf is a military dictator. Despite his talk of 'enlightened moderation,' Pakistan is not a democratic country. For Bush's visit, they have completely locked down Islamabad, the sky here is filled with military helicopters, I've never seen anything like it."<br />
