<p>WASHINGTON - April 17 - Campaign for Innocent Victims in Conflict (CIVIC) today announced the launch of a new web site, featuring news and information on civilian casualties, updates on CIVIC’s work in Washington and in conflict zones as well as state-of-the-art tools for online advocacy to help victims of war.  Also launched today is CIVIC’s Week of Action – an advocacy and education campaign in honor of CIVIC’s founder – the late Marla Ruzicka, her colleague Faiz Ali Salim and all war victims.
 
<p>“The new site reflects our mission to make the issue of civilian casualties accessible and visible to the public,” said Sarah Holewinski, executive director of CIVIC. “As advocates for victims of war, we believe strongly in promoting public awareness about the human cost of conflict.”  Holewinski added, “By launching this campaign on the anniversary of Marla and her colleague Faiz’s passing in Baghdad last year, we remember her passion and energy, and commit to carrying on her work.” 
 
<p><b>The ‘Week of Action’ includes: </b>
<p><b>MONDAY:</b>  A photo campaign that will visually appeal to policymakers and the media to focus on civilian casualties. Titled “I Care,” the campaign features photos of citizens from around the country and around the world showing support for victims of war.  <a href="http://icare.civicworldwide.org">http://icare.civicworldwide.org</a> <http://icare.civicworldwide.org><p><b>TUESDAY:</b>  A letter writing campaign to Congress. Americans can write to their congressional representatives at a critical time in the budget process for humanitarian initiatives in Iraq. 
 
<p><b>WEDNESDAY: </b>Letters to local editors. Writing to local newspapers across the country gives concerned citizens a personal way to shine a spotlight on the often forgotten human cost of war.
 
<p><b>THURSDAY:</b>  A fundraising effort.  To help CIVIC continue its work, supporters can use a new online tool to fundraise on the organization’s behalf.  
 
<p><b>FRIDAY:</b>  Get out the word about CIVIC.  On this day, current supporters of CIVIC will bolster the organization’s base by spreading the word to colleagues, friends and family. 
 
<p>CIVIC is a Washington-based organization founded by Marla Ruzicka, who was killed by a suicide bomb in Baghdad while advocating for civilian victims’ families in Iraq.  CIVIC believes that civilians killed or injured in conflict should be counted and their families compensated by the governments involved.  The organization works in Washington toward smart, compassionate policies for victims of war and in conflict zones to help the families of civilian casualties rebuild their lives. <!-- #EndEditable -->
