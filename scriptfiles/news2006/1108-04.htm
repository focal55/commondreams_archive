<p>WASHINGTON - November 8 - So far it’s not a good night for George Bush and his allies in Congress, but it’s shaping up as a great night for working families, who have expressed in no uncertain terms their desire to change the direction of our country.  It’s clear that working people were the engine driving the change in leadership in the House - - they want our leaders in Washington to address issues like jobs, health care and retirement security and they’re voting for a change to the economic status quo.  While the returns are still coming in, we’re pleased that union members and their families played a significant role in helping to shift the balance of power back to working people.  

 

<p>The AFL-CIO’s mid-term mobilization focused on 13.4 million union voters in 32 states. In the final four days of this election alone, more than 185,000 union volunteers participated in an unprecedented get-out-the-vote effort, making 7.9 million phone calls, knocking on 3.5 million doors and reaching 2 million workers at the worksite.  In addition the program focused on turning out millions of infrequent voters in battleground states.
