<p>WASHINGTON - April 24 - The SavetheInternet.com Coalition today launched a campaign to defend the free and open Internet from a bill being voted on in the House of Representatives beginning this week.<BR>
<BR>Congress is currently rewriting our nation's telecom laws. The SavetheInternet.com Coalition will mobilize public pressure to force Congress to resist a multimillion dollar lobbying effort by Internet providers like AT&T and Verizon to gut Network Neutrality, the Internet's First Amendment.<BR><BR>"Network neutrality is the First Amendment of the Internet," said Timothy Karr, campaign director of Free Press. "It ensures that the public can view the smallest blog just as easily as the largest corporate Web site by preventing companies like AT&T from rigging the playing field for only the highest-paying sites and services. Net neutrality is the reason why the Internet has driven economic innovation, democratic participation, and free speech online &mdash; and the public demands Congress not dismantle it."<BR><BR>Without Net Neutrality, issue organizations would essentially have to pay protection money to dominant Internet providers or risk that their Web sites were not as fully functional as corporate sites.<BR><BR>"Gun Owners of America opposes any attempt to limit or curtail political speech," said Craig Fields, director of Internet operations for Gun Owners of America. "Without statutory network neutrality, there is nothing to prevent big telecom companies from injecting political bias into the very skeleton of modern communications. If the telecoms believe they can frame opposition to their power grab as a liberal or anti-free-market attack, they are sadly mistaken."<BR><BR>Charter members of the SavetheInternet.com Coalition include: Professors Larry Lessig of Stanford University and Tim Wu of Columbia University, Free Press, Gun Owners of America, right-of-center Instapundit blogger Glenn Reynolds, MoveOn.org Civic Action, Consumers Union, Consumer Federation of America, Public Knowledge, Common Cause, the American Library Association and U.S. PIRG.<BR><BR>As early as next week, the House Energy and Commerce Committee is expected to vote on the "Communications Opportunity, Promotion, and Enhancement Act of 2006," a major overhaul of the Telecommunications Act of 1996. The current version of the bill – sponsored by Rep. Joe Barton (R-Texas), Rep. Fred Upton (R-Mich.), Rep. Charles Pickering (R-Miss.), and Rep. Bobby Rush – includes no meaningful protections for network neutrality.<BR><BR>"The future of the free, open and innovative Internet we have all enjoyed through the years is not guaranteed," said Gigi Sohn, president of Public Knowledge, a public interest group working on technology and intellectual property issues. "If the bill before the House Commerce Committee gives control of the Internet to the telephone and cable companies, the Internet we have come to appreciate could well cease to exist, and it will be almost impossible to get it back."<BR><BR>
