<p>SEATTLE - August 9 - More than 400 veterans from across the 
                                country committed to ending war will hold 
                                meetings here from August 10 through the 
                                13.<BR><BR>Veterans For Peace, whose membership 
                                includes veterans ranging from the Spanish Civil 
                                War to the current Iraq conflict will hold its 
                                national annual convention at the University of 
                                Washington campus.<BR><BR>In making the 
                                announcement, Gerri Haynes committee chairperson 
                                of the convention, said, &#8220;the concept that war 
                                is an extension of the negotiating table has to 
                                stop. That is essentially the theme of this 
                                meeting,&#8221; she added.<BR><BR>Best selling author 
                                o Confessions Economic Hit Man, John Perkins 
                                will be a main speaker when the convention opens 
                                it&#8217;s doors to the public on August 12 at 7PM in 
                                the Husky Union Building on the UW campus. 
                                Perkins spent three decades in the private 
                                sector convincing third world countries to 
                                accept enormous loans for infrastructure 
                                development by major U. S. engineering firms. 
                                The crux of his message is that once saddled 
                                with these debts the countries would default, 
                                paving the way for control by the U. S. 
                                Government and international aid agencies.
