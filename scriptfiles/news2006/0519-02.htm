<p>PARIS - May 19 - A leaked document on the vulnerability to terrorist attack of the new European Pressurised Reactor (EPR) - being considered or already under construction in several countries including UK, France and Finland - reveals a dangerously flawed approach to security, according to a study commissioned by Greenpeace International. (1)</p>
    <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="">The
Electricite de France (EDF) document relates to the projected performance of
the AREVA designed Generation III European Pressurized Reactor, the first of
which is being built at Olkiluoto in Finland with a second planned for a site
at Flammanville, Normandy, France.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>EDF
has also submitted proposals to the UK government to build ten such reactors,
and is seeking to export the design to China and India.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="">Nuclear
engineering consultancy, Large and Associates, in the commissioned study
assessed the secret EDF document and concluded that it includes seriously
flawed assumptions about whether the reactor could withstand a potential
terrorist attack using hijacked commercial aircraft; fallacies include:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="">* the
impact of a 250 tonne commercial jet aircraft is considered to be in the same
range as a military aircraft (2-5 tonnes) in terms of the energy of impact,
despite the greater induced shock from the much greater physical weight;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="">* that
up to 100 tonnes of aviation fuel from a commercial aircraft would burn within
two minutes - which is both unjustified and unproven. It also ignores the
possibility of fuel vapour forming within the reactor structures, the explosion
of which could severely damage the shield and the reactor within; <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="">* that
terrorists would have insufficient skills to pilot an aircraft onto the
intended target, despite the deadly accuracy of the 9/11 attacks having proven
how well trained and highly skilled they can become.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="">The EDF
document also discounts a serious risk of radioactive release from the reactor,
whilst also failing to consider potential radioactivity released from damage to
spent fuel rods and waste processing and storage sources on site<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="">"I
am not surprised at the controversy generated by this leaked document. This is
not because it reveals some highly sensitive details about the EPR design,
which it certainly does not, but more because it reflects what seems to be an
almost total lack of preparation to defend against the inevitability of
terrorist attack," said Dr Large. "A similar attack on a reactor
would cause a total calamity with the release of large amounts or
radioactivity."<o:p></o:p></span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="">The
leaked document was published in full this week by politicians and<span style="">&nbsp; </span>environmental organisations in France, in
protest at the arrest of an activist from the French Nuclear Phase-out network
(Sortir du Nucleaire), who was accused of violation of France's nuclear Secret
Defence by having a copy of the EDF document.(2) The activist, Stephane Lhomme,
was interrogated over 14 hours on Tuesday after ten anti-terrorist police and
others raided his home in Paris, removing documents, computers and phones.<o:p></o:p></span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="">"France's
nuclear state, including EDF, does not like public exposure. Their approach is
to intimidate and to seek to suppress information. But these issues are too
important to be left to a complacent bureaucracy and a self-interested nuclear
company with reactors to sell. The EPR is promoted as the future for nuclear
power but in reality it is the same dangerous unacceptable technology that has
plagued us for decades. Whatever the terrorist threat and targets a wind turbine
or solar panel is not on the list," said Shaun Burnie of Greenpeace
International.<o:p></o:p></span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="">Dr
Large and Stephane Lhomme with a delegation from Greenpeace will be visiting
the proposed site for the new EDF EPR reactor at Flammanville on Friday, 19
May.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
