<p>WASHINGTON - November 30 - As Capitol Hill's first green building, the headquarters of the Friends Committee on National Legislation (FCNL) offers a model for the next generation of office buildings in the District of Columbia. The Quaker peace lobby&rsquo;s recently renovated building, constructed out of two civil war era brownstones, is one of only a handful buildings in the D.C. that have cut energy use by more than 40 percent while creating an open, light working environment for employees. The building offers a preview of what Washington, DC could achieve through the city council proposal to require new, city funded project to meet green standards. 
<p><strong>Interviews, photos opportunities with Hart Senate Office Building as backdrop, and tours are available for members of the media. </strong>More information and a virtual tour of the building can be found on <a href="http://www.fcnl.org/building/">FCNL's website. </a></p>
          <p>The building&rsquo;s green features include geothermal heating and cooling, a vegetated roof, eco-friendly office furniture, a &ldquo;light scoop&rdquo; for natural lighting, bamboo floors, energy efficient windows, and bicycle parking. While adding to the building&rsquo;s initial <a href="http://fcnl.org/building/questions.htm">construction costs</a>, these energy-saving features provide long term savings that will allow FCNL to recoup the extra cost in about five years. </p>
          <p>FCNL&rsquo;s work in Washington includes advocacy for <a href="http://fcnl.org/energy/">environmental protection and the use of renewable energy sources</a>, and in July 2003 the organization began renovations on its Civil War-era office building that would reflect its commitment to reduced energy consumption and vision for an earth restored. Construction was completed in August 2005. The building is LEED-registered with certification expected in the next few months.</p>
          <p>The Washington Chapter of the American Institute of Architects in October 2006 presented a Presidential Citation for Sustainable Design to FCNL, architect Burt Hill, and general contractor Kfoury Construction for the FCNL green building. &quot;Sometimes buildings are said to have a soul,&quot; explained AIA Vice President Todd Ray in presenting the award. &quot;This one has a conscience.&quot;</p>
