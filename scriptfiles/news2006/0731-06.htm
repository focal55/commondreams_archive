<p>WASHINGTON - July 31 - 
<p> WHAT: National conference call open to media <br>
WHEN: Tonight, Monday, July 31, at 8:20 p.m.<br>
WHO: Sen. Barack Obama (D-Ill.) and Al Franken headline 685-plus GOTV House Parties Nationwide
<p>DETAILS: 

<p>Tonight, MoveOn members will gather in homes across the nation to eat dessert, get energized on a conference call with Sen. Barack Obama and Air America host Al Franken, and strategize about what they can do locally to ensure a national democratic victory in 2006.

<p>To listen to the Obama/Franken conference call or to attend an event, contact <a href="mailto:alex@fenton.com">alex@fenton.com</a>.

<p>Tonight's events have seen record sign-ups. People are invited to bring their favorite desserts to share in tonight's community potluck-style gatherings -- all as political strategy for 2006 is discussed. The gatherings will begin at 8 p.m., and the conference call will begin at 8:20 p.m.

<p>MoveOn.org Political Action will also unveil a cutting-edge "Call for Change" phone program that empowers Americans who live busy lives to make phone calls in 15-minute blocks to targeted voters around the country. This program was piloted in this year's CA-50 special House election. In a controlled experiment, Yale University researchers found that this voter outreach was more effective than any other volunteer phone bank measured before. 

<p>"Americans are clearly energized for a national change election," said Eli Pariser, executive director of MoveOn.org Political Action. "At tonight's house parties, communities will come together to get pumped up by Barack Obama and Al Franken, and to kick into gear our local planning for national Democratic victory in 2006."


<p><b>Event Details:</b>

<p>WHAT: 687 local house parties to plan national Democratic victory in 2006 -- and national conference call with Sen. Barack Obama and Air America's Al Franken.
<br>

WHEN: Tonight -- Monday, July 31, at 8:20 p.m. for the conference call. (8 p.m. start time for house parties.)
