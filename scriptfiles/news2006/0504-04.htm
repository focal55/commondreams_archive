<p>WASHINGTON - May 4 - A tax cut bill widely  expected to pass in Hawaii's legislature will do little to reduce  the income tax burdens faced by low-income Hawaiians, according  to a new analysis by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. </p>
<p>   In the next few days, Hawaii's legislature will consider the  conference agreement on changes to Hawaii's income tax, HB957.   This agreement, which appears to have the support of legislative  leadership and the governor, increases the standard deductions  and expands the tax brackets beginning in tax year 2007. </p>
<p>   The bill fails to remedy a well-documented problem in Hawaii's  tax system:  the high income tax Hawaii levies on poor working  families. A Center on Budget and Policy Priorities report earlier  this year found that in tax year 2005, Hawaii was one of the  states with the very highest income taxes on families with  poverty-level earnings. Despite its substantial cost, HB957  provides relatively little tax reduction for working-poor  families and does little to improve Hawaii's standing relative to  other states. </p>
<p>   Of the 42 states with income taxes, Hawaii in 2005 imposed the second-highest income tax in the nation on one-parent families of  three with income at the federal poverty line.  Under HB957 and  other tax changes passed this year, Hawaii will still impose the  second-highest income tax on these families. </p>
<p>   -- Under HB957, Hawaii's tax thresholds, the lowest income at  which families are required to pay income tax, will be the fourth  lowest in the nation, and still well below the federal poverty  line. </p>
<p>   -- A separate analysis by the Institute on Taxation and  Economic Policy finds that the poorest 40 percent of Hawaii  residents -- those with income under $31,000 -- will receive only  20 percent of the benefits of the bill. </p>
<p>   Hawaii's income tax imposes a major burden on poor and near- poor working families.  The Center study of state income tax  systems found that, overall, Hawaii's income tax in 2005 was  second only to Alabama's in the burden it imposed on low-income  families, and it was far outside the national mainstream.   Alabama has since significantly reduced its taxes on the poor.   HB957 directs only a fraction of its benefit to low-income  families, and so leaves Hawaii's income tax system well outside  the national mainstream in its tax treatment of the working poor. </p>
