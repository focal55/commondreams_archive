<p>WASHINGTON - April 11 - As World Bank President Paul 
Wolfowitz unveiled his much anticipated framework 
to fight corruption at the World Bank today in 
Jakarta, Jubilee USA Network and East Timor and 
Indonesia Action Network today urged a bolder and 
more comprehensive approach, including efforts to 
meaningfully address its past corrupt lending to 
the impoverished country, especially under former dictator Suharto.

<p>The East Timor and Indonesia Action Network 
argues that if President Wolfowitz is truly 
concerned about corruption in Indonesia, the 
World Bank must acknowledge its role in fostering 
corruption in the impoverished country through 30 
years of lending to the kleptocratic Suharto 
dictatorship. The Bank's lending to Suharto 
enabled the military to continue to abuse human 
rights not only in Indonesia but in the now-independent state of East Timor.

<p>"The people of Indonesia suffered greatly under 
the Suharto dictatorship. They should not be made 
to suffer again by being forced to pay back his 
debt," said John M. Miller, National Coordinator 
of the East Timor and Indonesia Action Network. 
"Any effort to end corruption in Indonesia must 
tackle its most corrupt institution. The 
Indonesian military is deeply involved in 
businesses, illegal and legal, receives 
protection payoffs from foreign corporations, and 
remains largely unaccountable to its civilian leadership."

<p>Jubilee USA Network and the Indonesian Anti-Debt 
Coalition call on the World Bank and other 
Northern creditors to cancel Indonesia's odious 
and illegitimate debt. The combination of 
persistent and wide-spread poverty in Indonesia 
and the odious nature of Suharto-era debt provide 
a compelling argument for the 100% cancellation 
of Indonesia's debt. Such cancellation must come 
without harmful economic conditions attached. In 
US Senate testimony, Northwestern University 
professor Jeffrey Winters found that at least 
one-third of World Bank loans to Suharto were stolen by his regime.

<p>"Many of the major lenders - the World Bank, 
International Monetary Fund (IMF), the Asian 
Development Bank and some G-8 countries - made 
large loans to the Indonesian government during 
Suharto's regime knowing that significant amounts 
would either be used to oppress the people or 
would be lost to corruption," argues Ardi St. 
Majo Endah, Coordinator of the Anti-Debt 
Coalition (KAU) in Indonesia. "As a result, a 
growing number of voices both inside and outside 
Indonesia are calling for the cancellation of 
Indonesia's debt not only as a question of 
charity or meeting human needs, but as a question of justice."

<p>In addition to canceling Indonesia odious debt, 
Jubilee USA Network argues that a comprehensive 
approach to corruption would include the 
development and implementation of clear standards 
for responsible lending, assuring 
transparency/accountability, human rights, and 
environmental sustainability to avoid the 
creation of new odious debts in the future.

<p>Jubilee USA Network is the US arm of the 
international movement working for debt 
cancellation for impoverished nations. Jubilee 
USA is a network of 75 religious denominations 
and faith-based groups, labor groups, 
environmental organizations, and community and 
advocacy groups working for freedom from debt and 
economic justice for countries in Africa, Asia, 
and Latin America. See <http://www.jubileeusa.org/>www.jubileeusa.org.

<p>The East Timor and Indonesia Action Network was 
founded in November 1991 to support genuine 
self-determination and human rights for the 
people of East Timor. ETAN advocates for 
democracy, justice and human rights for East 
Timor and Indonesia. ETAN calls for an 
international tribunal to prosecute crimes 
against humanity committed in East Timor from 
1975 to 1999 and for restrictions on U.S. 
military assistance to Indonesia until there is 
genuine reform of its security forces. For
