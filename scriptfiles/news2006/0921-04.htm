<p>SAN FRANCISCO - September 21 - Rainforest Action Network, Greenpeace and Amazon Watch demanded greater corporate responsibility from companies participating in Bank of America’s 36th annual investors conference this week. Gathered outside San Francisco’s Ritz-Carlton Hotel, activists confronted investors with street theater and banners to spread the word about the environmentally and socially destructive practices of companies like Wells Fargo and Kimberly-Clark. Groups are also calling on ConocoPhillips to abandon oil drilling plans in the Amazon.<br />
<br />Over the course of the four-day conference, activists snuck into conference sessions to ask CEOs about their poor environmental and social policies; slipped information about the companies’ destructive practices under conference participants’ doors; delivered letters from affected communities, performed colorful street theater in front of the hotel; protested in giant Kleenex boxes outside a City Hall reception; and offered an alternative cooking demonstration using coal, oil and wood chips at Tuesday night’s Taste of California banquet.<br /><br />“Wells Fargo may not care that investing in mountaintop coal removal in Appalachia destroys communities and the environment, but we thought its investors would,” said Scott Parkin, Global Finance campaigner at Rainforest Action Network. “Investors are in a perfect position to tell Wells Fargo to stop investing in destruction and start investing in the future.”<br /><br />Wells Fargo is the largest US bank currently operating without a comprehensive environmental policy. Kimberly-Clark Corporation makes Kleenex and other disposable tissue products from clear-cut ancient forests, including North America’s Boreal forest. ConocoPhillips, which has more Amazon rainforest holdings than any other US oil company, is being called on to reconsider drilling plans in several controversial rainforest oil blocks recently inherited from its acquisition of Burlington Resources. &nbsp;<br /><br />“We want investors to be fully aware that if they invest in Kimberly-Clark they are investing in forest destruction,” said Pamela Wellner, Greenpeace Senior Campaigner.<br /><br />&nbsp;“ConocoPhillips’ controversial oil concessions expose the company to reputational risks, something that investors should be concerned about. ConocoPhillips is at crossroads. The company’s decision to drill or not in the Amazon is a litmus test of their stated commitments to corporate responsibility,” said Kevin Koenig of Amazon Watch.</p>
