<p>WASHINGTON - July 18 - Congress claims it wants sound science to govern decisions. And when credible air pollution researchers all agree the U.S. EPA should set better health standards for deadly particle soot, Congress should applaud.

<p>The American Medical Association, the American Thoracic Society and the American Academy of Pediatrics all say the current standards don't protect their patients and the public. And so do other health and environmental groups.

<p>But big polluters are fighting back -- with industry-bought science that seeks to cast doubt on the need to clean up. And now they've enlisted some powerful senators to carry their water (or dirty air, as the case may be).

<p>The clock is ticking for EPA to make a final decision. An announcement is due in September. And, quite literally, thousands of lives hang in the balance. Will political pressure and industry-paid science triumph over truth? 

<p>For the answers, please join a July 19 luncheon briefing at the National Press Club. Prominent researchers will explain why particle pollution needs to be cleaned up, and why industry is just blowing smoke.

<blockquote><b>Who: </b>Speakers from the American Thoracic Society, Johns Hopkins University, New York University Medical Center, the American Lung Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics

<p><b>When:</b> Wednesday, July 19, 1 pm EDT (Lunch served)

<p><b>Where:</b> National Press Club, Zenger Room, 529 14th St. NW, 13th floor, Washington, DC 20045
