<p>WASHINGTON - January 10 - <p>   WHAT: Conference Call Briefing</p>
<p>   Last-Minute Changes Made in 2003 to Medicare Drug Benefit  Causing Serious Unintended Problems; Will Recent Changes to  Medicaid Do the Same?</p>
<p>   WHEN:     Thursday, January 12 at 12 p.m. (ET)</p>
<p>   WHO:</p>
<p>   -- Jude Walsh, Special Assistant to the Governor of Maine.</p>
<p>   -- Jocelyn Guyer, Senior Program Director, Center for Children  and Families, Georgetown University Health Policy Institute</p>
<p>   The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities will hold a  conference call briefing Thursday, January 12, at 12 p.m. (ET) to  examine factors causing many low-income beneficiaries to fall  through the cracks as the new Medicare drug benefit is  implemented.  As the briefers will explain, these problems are  rooted in aspects of the 2003 Medicare drug law that were  designed behind closed doors at the very end of the legislative  process and never received appropriate scrutiny before the votes  on final passage.  This process now appears to be repeating  itself in the budget reconciliation bill, with the inclusion of  several hastily designed, far-reaching Medicaid provisions in the  recent budget reconciliation conference agreement that may have  serious unintended consequences.</p>
<p>   Since January 1, a number of states have had to intervene on  an emergency basis to provide prescription drugs to low-income  people who are not receiving the Medicare drug coverage to which  they are entitled.</p>
<p>   Under a change that Congress made to the Medicare drug  legislation after it had passed both the House and Senate, these  individuals -- low-income seniors and people with disabilities  who qualify for both Medicare and Medicaid -- had their Medicaid  drug coverage terminated on January 1 regardless of whether they  were receiving drug coverage through Medicare at that point.   Repeated assurances by senior Administration officials that these  individuals would be shifted smoothly to the Medicare drug  benefit have proved unfounded.</p>
<p>   In a similar vein, congressional negotiators, operating behind  closed doors, made several major last-minute Medicaid changes to  the budget conference agreement now scheduled for a final House  vote on February 1. These changes, which were not in the earlier  versions of the legislation approved by the House or Senate,  could have serious effects on low-income beneficiaries.  For  example, the conference agreement would allow states to impose  co-payments of unlimited size on beneficiaries with incomes below  the poverty line and also could cause poor children to lose  coverage for important health services.</p>
<p>   Like the last-minute changes to the Medicare drug bill, these  changes appear not to have been fully thought through and rely on  complex administrative procedures that may not prove workable.</p>
<p>   After opening remarks, the panelists will take questions.</p>
