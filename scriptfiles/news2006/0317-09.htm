Lessin is co-founder of Military Families Speak Out, which is protesting the war with 50 events in 26 states listed on their web page. She can put media in touch with their members around the country. Lessin said today: "As we commemorate the third year of this war that should never have happened, the U.S. government is escalating with a major air offensive.
