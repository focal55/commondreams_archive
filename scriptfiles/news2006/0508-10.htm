<p>WASHINGTON - May 8 - The proposals Congress is debating to address rising gas prices – such as drilling in the Arctic Refuge or off of our coasts - will do nothing to solve America’s energy problems. As a nation, we simply can not drill our way to lower gas prices. This Congress continues to fiddle while consumers are doing a slow burn at the pump.

<p>Any gas or oil found in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge or on America's fragile coasts would amount to a mere drop in the bucket and wouldn't be available until the middle of the next decade. Allowing ExxonMobil to drill in our last protected wilderness areas would be nothing less than another windfall for an industry already drowning in profits. And at best, oil from the Arctic Refuge would reduce the price of oil by about a penny in 25 years.

<p>Bottom line, drilling in the Arctic Refuge would ruin one of America’s last wild places and would not solve our current energy problems.

<p>Instead of more drilling and other sops to ExxonMobil, Congress should promote energy efficiency and other clean energy solutions. Clearly, the best way to reduce consumer costs is making our cars go farther on a gallon of gas and by using clean, renewable energy sources.
