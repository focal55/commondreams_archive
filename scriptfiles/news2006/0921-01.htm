<p>WASHINGTON - September 21 - Legislation introduced  by Senator George Allen (R-Va.) and Rep. Frank Wolf (R-Va.) to  create a federal &quot;National Heritage Area&quot; that encompasses  portions of Virginia, Maryland, West Virginia and Pennsylvania is  likely to disproportionately harm minority families in the region  by making homeownership more inaccessible, say members of the  Project 21 black leadership network.</p>
<p>   The &quot;Journey Through Hallowed Ground National Heritage Area  Act of 2006&quot; is S. 2645 in the Senate and H.R. 5195 in the House.</p>
<p>   &quot;Rather than promote initiatives that harm property rights and  make it harder for minorities to obtain a piece of the American  Dream, Senator Allen should focus on protecting the property  rights of all Americans,&quot; said Project 21 member and Virginia  resident John Meredith.</p>
<p>   Meredith, who has experience working on environmental and land  use issues, is also the son of James Meredith, the first black  student admitted to the University of Mississippi in 1962.</p>
<p>   &quot;The last thing that wealthy, preservation interest groups  need is a leg up from the federal government -- especially when  that leg up comes on the back of minorities and the lower middle  class,&quot; said Meredith.</p>
<p>   National Heritage Areas are land areas where preservationist  interest groups and the federal government have teamed up to  influence local land use decisions, frequently in ways that have  restricted property rights.</p>
<p>   A March 2004 report from the General Accountability Office  found that provisions of such areas &quot;encourage local governments  to implement land use policies that are consistent with the  heritage area's plans, which may allow heritage areas to  indirectly influence zoning and land use planning in ways that  could restrict owners' use of their property.&quot;</p>
<p>   Although the bill was introduced ostensibly for the purpose of  historic preservation, and its advocates -- apparently for public  relations purposes -- have marketed it as a pro-tourism measure,  supporters have repeatedly claimed the bill is needed to combat  suburban sprawl.</p>
<p>   New land-use restrictions affecting housing availability could  be bad news for minorities in the &quot;hallowed ground&quot; region. A  National Center for Public Policy Research -- commissioned  econometric study, &quot;Smart Growth and Its Effects on Housing  Markets: The New Segregation,&quot; found that anti-sprawl policies  disproportionately and negatively affect minority homeownership:</p>
<p>   Poor and minority families pay a disproportionate amount of  the social and economic costs of growth restrictions. The weight  of increased home prices falls most heavily on minorities, the  disadvantaged and the young, fewer of whom already own homes. The  &quot;haves&quot; who already own homes ride the price bubble created by  restricted growth policies while the dream of ownership moves  further away from the &quot;have-nots.&quot;</p>
<p>   The 2002 study, which examined the social and economic impact  of one model for sharply curtailing sprawl, found that growth  restrictions would have prevented 260,000 minority homeowner  families from homeownership had they been applied nationally over  the preceding decade.</p>
<p>   Housing restrictions can have strong, negative affects on the  quality of life for families who cannot afford skyrocketing  housing prices.  The introduction to the &quot;New Segregation&quot; study  tells the story of a 45-year-old waitress living in Fairfax  County, Virginia, who, despite having over $2,000 a month to  spend, lives in a seedy hotel with her four children and receives  financial aid from the county because the average rent in the  area at the time was over $1,100 per month.  During the 1990s,  due to Fairfax County's severe development restrictions, the  county added 110,000 fewer housing units than it did new jobs.</p>
<p>   &quot;Serving the interests of preservationist elites at the  expense of normal, everyday Americans is unacceptable,&quot; said  Project 21 Senior Fellow Deneen Moore. &quot;The public outcry over  last year's U.S. Supreme Court decision in the Kelo eminent  domain case shows that Americans want stronger property rights  protections - not new threats to private ownership.&quot;</p>
<p>   &quot;I am at a loss to understand how this furthers the interests  of anyone but the super-elite,&quot; said Project 21 national chairman  Mychal Massie. &quot;Suffice it to say that this land-use initiative  is harmful and punitive to the very people elected officials  promised to protect.&quot;</p>
<p>   Project 21, a nonprofit and nonpartisan organization, has been  a leading voice of the African-American community since 1992.
