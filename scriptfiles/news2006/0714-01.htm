<p>WASHINGTON - July 14 -

The Senate is expected to vote next week on three bills related to stem-cell research, including a measure that would expand federal funding for a procedure that uses and destroys human embryos in the drive to cure diseases that afflict millions of Americans. The Senate is expected to pass that bill, but President Bush has promised to veto it. This is the latest chapter in the ongoing social and political debate over stem cell research and the proper use of new scientific technologies.

<p>In an effort to help inform this debate, The Century Foundation has published Stem Cells and Public Policy- a guide to the issues. This is the newest publication in The Century Foundation's series, The Basics. Stem Cells and Public Policy, provides a concise, comprehensive overview of the implications of stem cell research for the development of public policy. It addresses critical questions related to stem cell research including the establishment of medical research priorities, the treatment of intellectual property rights, the role of religious and scientific institutions and the effective national and international governance of the burgeoning field of biotechnology.

<p>Stem Cells and Public Policy was written by Richard Hayes of the Center for Genetics and Society in collaboration with Pete Shanks and Marcy Darnovsky, under the direction of Leif Wellington Haase, health care fellow at The Century Foundation. Haase can shed light on the many complicated issues related to this current political debate and speak to the broader issues related to creating policy around the development and use of stem cell technologies and the new human biotechnologies.

<p>The Century Foundation's Basics series offers readers a clear, succinct summary of essential facts about important policy issues and unbiased assessments of strengths and weaknesses of reform proposals in the news. These guides are important resources for legislators, journalists, students, and the general public who want the facts and analysis without the rhetoric. Other titles in this series include Public Policy in an Aging America, The USA Patriot Act, Social Security Reform, and Medicare Reform. These and other guides in the Basics series can be downloaded from The Century Foundation Web site at <a href="http://www.tcf.org%20" target="_new">http://www.tcf.org
