<p>NEW ORLEANS - May 25 - Marie Benoit had worked 28 years as a teacher for the Orleans Parish School system before hurricane Katrina disrupted her life. Now, eight months later, she’s living in a FEMA trailer and supported by $232 of unemployment benefits.
</p>
<p>But those benefits are scheduled to run out for Benoit and about 80,000 others next week, unless Congress approves an extension before recessing for the Memorial Day weekend.
</p>
<p>Benoit, a member of ACORN (Association of Community Organization for Reform Now), is urging people to contact their Senators and Congressmen to pass House Bill 5397, which extends disaster unemployment assistance for 13 weeks.
</p>
<p>“I’m just one of so many people who are facing this horrific situation,’’ Benoit said. “What’s so ironic is June 3 is two days after the start of the hurricane season. That means you’re coming into the most dangerous part of the season without any income.’’
</p>
<p>After being evacuated to Houston, Benoit returned to New Orleans three months ago to begin restoring her life. She’s facing numerous obstacles, and counts the perception that everything is OK in New Orleans as one of them.
</p>
<p>“People don’t understand that just because the French Quarter is open, other parts of the city is still in shambles,’’ Benoit said. “All is not well.’’
</p>
<p>“I think the canceling of unemployment benefits is an injustice on top of everything else,’’ Benoit said. “This is not making our burdens lighter, but weighing us down heavier. Now this is something else you can’t count on; you can’t count on anything.’’
