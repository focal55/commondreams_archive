<p>WASHINGTON - June 8 - “I commend our military forces for their great accomplishment.  Abu Musab al-Zarqawi was a ruthless terrorist who led an insurgent campaign of brutal suicide bombings, kidnappings and hostage beheadings in Iraq.  This is great news for the Iraqi government and the Iraqi people.  It is also a testament to the professionalism and capability of the men and women in uniform in the U.S. military and the effectiveness of well-planned and targeted operations.  

 

<p>Unfortunately, al-Zarqawi’s death will probably not end the insurgency.  As long as large numbers of U.S. troops remain indefinitely in Iraq, that country will remain a crucible for the recruitment and development of a wide range of terrorist networks determined to fight so-called American ‘occupiers.’  It’s time to refocus our global fight against terrorism.  We must move away from the Iraq-centric policies that are draining our resources and focus on Al Qaeda and its affiliates who are reportedly operating in reportedly some 60 to 80 countries around the world.”
