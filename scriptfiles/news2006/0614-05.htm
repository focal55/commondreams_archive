<p>WASHINGTON - June 14 - Right-wing pundit Ann  Coulter has made numerous appearances on television and radio  programs to promote her latest book, "Godless: The Church of  Liberalism" (Crown Forum, June 2006). Since her June 6 interview  on NBC's Today with co-host Matt Lauer, Coulter has defended  comments from her book attacking some of the 9/11 widows as  "celebrities ... stalked by grief-arazzis," who are "enjoying  their husbands' deaths." However, while those who have  interviewed Coulter in recent days have noted some of her more  egregious statements from the book, many have largely ignored  some controversial issues surrounding Coulter. </p>
<p>   Media Matters for America suggests the media ask Coulter the  following questions:</p>
<p>   Questions relating to plagiarism</p>
<p>   -- Can you explain the similarity of this passage from your  most recent book to work previously published by others you did  not cite or quote? (From a post on the Weblog The Rude Pundit): </p>
<p>   Here's Coulter from Chapter 1 of "Godless:" "The massive  Dickey-Lincoln Dam, a $227 million hydroelectric project proposed  on upper St. John River in Maine, was halted by the discovery of  the Furbish lousewort, a plant previously believed to be  extinct."</p>
<p>   Here's the Portland Press Herald, from the year 2000, in its  list of the "Maine Stories of the Century": "The massive Dickey- Lincoln Dam, a $227 million hydroelectric project proposed on  upper St. John River, is halted by the discovery of the Furbish  lousewort, a plant believed to be extinct." </p>
<p>   -- Can you explain prior instances of passages you have  written that are also remarkably similar to works previously  published by others you did not cite or quote? (From an August 4,  2005, article by Tucson Weekly columnist Walt Nett, citing  examples highlighted by The Rude Pundit and The Raw Story): </p>
<p>   The Coulter chase began July 1 when a blogger called The Rude  Pundit (<a href="http://releases.usnewswire.com/redir.asp?ReleaseID=67538&Link=http://rudepundit.blogspot.com">http://rudepundit.blogspot.com</a>) compared four  unattributed comments in Coulter's column to text from the  December 1993 edition of a now-defunct Web magazine, "The  Flummery Digest." (If the publication is deceased, is it  plagiarism or grave-robbing?) Here's one example Rude Pundit  provided: </p>
<p>   "From Ann Coulter, talking about what taxpayers have funded:  'A photo of a newborn infant with its mouth open titled to  suggest the infant was available for oral sex.' </p>
<p>   "From The Flummery Digest: 'The title of a photo of a newborn  infant with its mouth open suggested that the infant was  available for oral sex.' " </p>
<p>   The Raw Story (<a href="http://releases.usnewswire.com/redir.asp?ReleaseID=67538&Link=http://www.rawstory.com),">http://www.rawstory.com),</a> an online  "alternative news nexus," dug around further. In a July 20 story  titled "Coulter Caught Cribbing From Conservative Magazines," Raw  Story presented another half-dozen questionable paragraphs -- two  from a Jan. 24, 1995 column in the Boston Globe and four from  various issues of an MIT-based magazine, "Counterpoint." </p>
<p>   Should we be surprised? Not really. The conservative group  CoulterWatch (<a href="http://releases.usnewswire.com/redir.asp?ReleaseID=67538&Link=http://www.coulterwatch.com">http://www.coulterwatch.com</a>) offers strong evidence  that portions of Coulter's book, "High Crimes and Misdemeanors:  The Case Against Bill Clinton," were lifted from articles and  research by a former Coulter colleague -- who she since has  denied ever knowing -- at "Human Events" magazine. </p>
<p>   -- Are you able to refute other possible examples of  plagiarism in your work, as documented by The Raw Story?</p>
<p>   Questions relating to possible illegal voting</p>
<p>   -- Why did you try to vote in a precinct in which you are not  registered? Why did you then leave when you were told that you  had to file a change-of-address form?</p>
<p>   On February 15, The Palm Beach Post reported that when voting  in local town council elections in Florida, Coulter "cast her  ballot in a precinct 4 miles north of the precinct where she owns  a home." Two days later, the Post reported that Coulter had  attempted to vote in the wrong precinct, quoting the Palm Beach  poll worker who confronted Coulter on her mistake: </p>
<p>   A Palm Beach poll worker says he tried to help GOP-loving  pundit Ann Coulter vote in the right precinct last week. But, Jim  Whited says, Coulter dashed out of the polling place when he told  her she needed to file a change of address.</p>
<p>   On the June 6 edition of Fox News' Hannity & Colmes, co-host  Alan Colmes noted that the Palm Beach election supervisor had  accused Coulter of "voting in the wrong district and not  answering a registered letter that they sent" to her. Colmes then  asked Coulter: "So could you address those charges and tell us  what happened?" Coulter quickly denied the allegations, but  refused to provide any substantive details, instead declaring  that "I think the syphilis has gone to their (the Palm Beach  election officials') brains," and adding that the reporters  writing about the incident are "all retarded."  </p>
<p>   -- After you left that precinct, why did you cast a ballot in  another precinct that was not your own?</p>
<p>   According to the same Palm Beach Post article, "(l)ater,  elections records show, Coulter cast her ballot 2 miles up the  road -- in the wrong precinct."</p>
<p>   The Post also reported that Coulter's voter registration in  Florida did not contain her correct address, noting that "Florida  statutes make it a third-degree felony to vote knowingly in the  wrong precinct. Lying on a voter's registration can cost up to  $5,000 and five years behind bars."</p>
<p>   -- Can you confirm that you have hired a lawyer to defend you  against allegations of illegal voting?</p>
<p>   On June 2, Palm Beach Post columnist Jose Lambiet noted that  Coulter "hired a white-glove, White House-connected law firm to  fight allegations she voted illegally in February's Town of Palm  Beach election." He added that her lawyer is "one of the lead  attorneys who fought for George W. Bush's side in the 2000  presidential election" in Florida.</p>
<p>   -- Why are you registered to vote in both Florida and  Connecticut, which is illegal according to a Connecticut  registrar, even though you told Fox News that you live in New  York and not Florida or Connecticut?</p>
<p>   In a June 7 article on the Palm Beach County investigation  into Coulter's voting, the New York Daily News reported that  "Coulter is also registered to vote in New Canaan, Conn. --  though the local registrar told the Daily News yesterday it's  illegal to be registered in two places at once." The article  noted that Coulter told Fox News "she actually lives in New York"  and owns a condominium in New York, but "has never registered to  vote there."</p>
<p>   Question relating to church attendance</p>
<p>   -- Why does the spokesman for the church you have said you  attend say that you are not a member of the church and are not  known by the congregation?</p>
<p>   In a June 8 Raw Story article, Media Matters staff member Max  Blumenthal noted that, while Coulter's book "denounces liberalism  as 'the opposition party to God,'" a spokesman for the church she  professes to attend says that her congregation "do(esn't) really  know her." Blumenthal quoted an April 17, 2005, Time magazine  article, in which writer John Cloud "suggested that she has been  a regular attendee of New York City's Redeemer Presbyterian  Church, to which 'she brings a lot of people.'" Blumenthal then  detailed his inquiry with the Manhattan church regarding  Coulter's purported attendance there.</p>
<p>   When contacted by Raw Story, however, Redeemer Presbyterian's  Communications and Media Director Cregan Cooke could not confirm  that Coulter had ever attended services at the church.</p>
<p>   "The only thing I have heard is hearsay that she is an  attender" of Redeemer, Cregan told Raw Story. "Our database shows  that she is not a member ... And I don't know anybody that would  have seen Ann Coulter. We don't really know her." </p>
<p>   -- Do you dispute the spokesperson's assertion that you are  not a member? Can you name anyone who has been to the church and  seen you there?</p>
