<p>WASHINGTON - August 2 - With the Washington,  D.C. area gasping under a &quot;code red&quot; alert, the non-profit Clean  Air Watch today reported that breathers in 38 states plus the  District of Columbia gasped through serious smog problems in  July. </p>
<p>   The Clean Air Watch Smog Survey was released as researchers in  California reported that outdoor air pollution is causing  increased deaths among infants. </p>
<p>   Clean Air Watch noted the heat wave that has rocked the nation  also brought a &quot;blanket of smog&quot; from California to Maine. </p>
<p>   Public health standards for ozone, or smog, were breached more  than 1,000 times at state-run air pollution monitors in July,  according to the survey by Clean Air Watch volunteers. The total  was a slight increase over July 2005, continuing a 2006 trend. </p>
<p>   &quot;Over the years, we have made progress against smog,&quot; noted  Frank O'Donnell, president of Clean Air Watch.  &quot;But this survey  shows that we have a long way to go before we can take an easy  breath.&quot; </p>
<p>   He called on the U.S. EPA to make good on an &quot;overdue&quot; promise  to clean up high-polluting diesel freight trains and boats.   Noting that existing diesel engines remain a huge source of  pollution, O'Donnell observed that &quot;Congressional cheapskates  have cut President Bush's budget request to clean up existing  dirty diesel engines.&quot; </p>
<p>   O'Donnell added that &quot;unless we start getting serious about  global warming,&quot; predicted increases in global temperatures could  mean continued smog problems in the future.  &quot;And that will mean  more asthma attacks, disease, and death.&quot; </p>
<p>   Infant death from pollution was the focus of the new study by  researchers from the University of California at Los Angeles.  In  a study to be published in the journal Pediatrics  <a href="http://releases.usnewswire.com/redir.asp?ReleaseID=70152&Link=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/abstract/118/2/493?ct=ct">http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/abstract/118/2/493?ct=ct</a> </p>
<p>   The scientists found increased sudden infant death syndrome  and other increased deaths among infants in Southern California  exposed to outdoor air pollution. </p>
<p>   Details of the Clean Air Watch survey are available through  Clean Air Watch and at <a href="http://releases.usnewswire.com/redir.asp?ReleaseID=70152&Link=http://www.blogforcleanair.blogspot.com/">http://www.blogforcleanair.blogspot.com/</a>
