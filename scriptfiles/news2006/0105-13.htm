<p>WASHINGTON - January 5 - Americans United for Separation of Church and State today deplored TV preacher Pat Robertson’s comments about Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon.

<p>In remarks on his “700 Club” program, Robertson suggested that God had caused Sharon’s severe medical problems because of the Israeli official’s land policies.

<p>Said the Rev. Barry W. Lynn, executive director of Americans United, “Pat Robertson has a political agenda for the entire world, and he seems to think God is ready to take out any world leader who stands in the way of that agenda.

<p>“A religious leader should not be making callous political points while a man is struggling for his life,” Lynn continued. “I’m appalled. The last thing the world needs at this difficult moment is someone like Robertson offering these kinds of incendiary comments.”

<p>During his show, Robertson said, “Sharon was personally a very likeable person and I am sad to see him in this condition; but I think we need to look at the Bible and the Book of Joel. The Prophet Joel makes it very clear that God has enmity against those who ‘divide my land.’ God considers this land to be his. You read the Bible, he says ‘this is my land’ and for any prime minister of Israel who decides he’s going to carve it up and give it away, God says ‘No, this is mine.’”

<p>Continued Robertson, “And the same thing, I had a wonderful meeting with Yitzhak Rabin in 1974. He was tragically assassinated. It was a terrible thing to happen, but nevertheless he was dead, and now Ariel Sharon, who is again a very likeable person, a delightful person to be with, I’ve prayed with him personally, but here he’s at the point of death. He was dividing God’s land. And I would say, woe unto any prime minister of Israel who takes a similar course to appease the EU, the United Nations or the United States of America. God says, ‘This land belongs to me. You better leave it alone.’”
