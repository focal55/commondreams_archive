<p>LONDON - November 3 -  International demonstrations on climate change will take place worldwide on November 4, putting pressure on governments attending key United Nations climate talks due to start in Nairobi, Kenya on November 6, 2006. [1]

<p>Negotiators in Nairobi are set to discuss future action after 2012, when the first phase of the Kyoto climate change treaty will end.

<p>Demonstrators in more than forty five countries around the world are calling on world leaders to take the urgent action needed to prevent a catastrophic destabilisation of global climate. [2]

<p>Ministers will meet in Nairobi against this backdrop of growing calls for action on climate change, with demonstrations and rallies planned from Vancouver to Taipei, from Stockholm to Dhaka and from Paris to Abuja. Demonstrations are also planned in Nairobi on Saturday the 11th of November, midway through the climate talks.  [3]

<p>"Climate change is rapidly becoming the number one global justice issue and these global demonstrations reflect this fact. Faced with thousands of people across the world all demanding action on climate change, Ministers arriving in Nairobi must not forget they're negotiating the future for the planet," said Catherine Pearce, Friends of the Earth International climate campaigner.

<p>"We have learnt this week that climate change could push the world into the worst recession in recent history, comparable to the downturn of the great depression and two world wars [4]. Meeting in Africa, a continent already hit hard by our warming world, we need to see far greater attention to meet the needs of the most vulnerable," added Catherine Pearce.

<p>Some events planned:

<p>AUSTRALIA:
