<p>WASHINGTON - December 8 - A new  WorldPublicOpinion.org poll finds that a majority of Americans  believe that the way the United States has been using the threat  of military force has diminished U.S. security. </p>
<p>   Sixty-three percent believe that countries around the world  have grown more afraid that the United States will use force  against them and the same number thinks this is bad for U.S.  security.  Eighty percent believe that fear of the United States  has increased &quot;the likelihood that countries will try to acquire  weapons of mass destruction.&quot; </p>

<p>   The poll included interviews with a nationwide sample of 1,326  Americans conducted Nov. 21 to 29. It was developed in  conjunction with the conference, &quot;Leveraging U.S. Strength in an  Uncertain World,&quot; held by the Stanley Foundation Dec. 7 at the  Ronald Reagan Building, Washington, D.C.  The study was fielded  by Knowledge Networks using its probability-based online panel;  for information about this methodology, go to  <a href="http://releases.usnewswire.com/redir.asp?ReleaseID=77293&Link=http://www.knowledgenetworks.com/ganp">http://www.knowledgenetworks.com/ganp</a> </p>
<p>   Sixty-one percent believe that the U.S. invasion of Iraq has  increased the likelihood that Iran will build weapons of mass  destruction.  This is a sharp shift from 2003 when only 24  percent believed that the invasion increased the likelihood of  Iran acquiring WMD while 68 percent thought it decreased that  possibility. </p>
<p>   Steven Kull, editor of WorldPublicOpinion.org, comments, &quot;Most  Americans now believe that the recent thrust of U.S. foreign  policy has backfired: As the U.S. has provoked greater fear of  U.S. military force, countries have reacted in ways that have  reduced U.S. security.&quot;  </p>
<p>   When asked how the United States should deal with Iran, a  large majority (75 percent) prefers trying &quot;to build better  relations&quot; with Iran, rather than &quot;pressuring it with implied  threats that the U.S. may use military force against it,&quot; (22  percent).  Eight in 10 believe that threatening to bomb Iran's  uranium enrichment facilities would not deter the Iranians from  continuing their nuclear program.  </p>

<p>   A large majority (72 percent) does not think the United States  should announce it is pursuing regime change in countries, such  as Iran, which the United States sees as a problem.  Eight in 10  also reject the policy of isolating, rather than talking to,  problem countries.  </p>
