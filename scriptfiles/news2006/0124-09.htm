<p>WASHINGTON - January 24 - In a letter to the  Senate released today, Earthjustice and more than 50 other  conservation groups urged the Senate to oppose the confirmation  of Judge Samuel Alito Jr. to a lifetime seat on the Supreme  Court. ( The letter is available at  <a href="http://releases.usnewswire.com/redir.asp?ReleaseID=59675&Link=http://www.earthjustice.org/policy/judicial/pdf/Alito_enviro_opposition_Jan_23.pdf">http://www.earthjustice.org/policy/judicial/pdf/Alito_enviro_opposition_Jan_23.pdf</a>)  None of these groups opposed the confirmation of Chief Justice  John Roberts. </p>
<p>   &quot;Earthjustice has not opposed a Supreme Court nominee since  Judge Robert Bork in 1987,&quot; said Glenn Sugameli, Earthjustice  Senior Judicial Counsel. &quot;Judge Alito's record indicates that he  would pursue his own extreme legal theories to create new  barriers that prevent enforcement of laws that protect families  and communities from pollution. The Senate should refuse to  confirm Judge Alito.&quot; </p>
<p>   The environmental community has united around the opposition  of Judge Alito to a lifetime seat on the Supreme Court for the  following reasons: </p>
<p>   -- Commerce Clause: Judge Alito's record, including most  prominently his dissent in Rybar vs. United States, indicates  that he has a very narrow view of the Congress's authority under  the Constitution's Commerce Clause, which underlies most federal  environmental laws. During the hearing, Judge Alito refused to  acknowledge his faulty reasoning even though the Supreme Court  has essentially rejected his argument. In February, the Court is  scheduled to hear oral arguments on the scope of the Commerce  Clause in two critical cases that could restrict the geographic  jurisdiction of the Clean Water Act to a small fraction of its  current coverage. </p>
<p>   -- Standing and Access to Courts: Judge Alito has placed  unjustifiable hurdles in front of citizens that are trying to  make polluting corporations comply with basic environmental  safeguards. His record indicates that he will shut the courthouse  doors on citizens who are injured by polluting companies. In PIRG  vs. Magnesium Elektron, Judge Alito overturned a $2.6 million  dollar verdict against a polluter that violated its Clean Water  Act permit more than 150 times. In his hearing testimony, Judge  Alito refused to acknowledge that the subsequent Supreme Court  decision in Friends of the Earth v. Laidlaw invalidated the  reasoning he employed to deny the plaintiffs their day in court. </p>
<p>   -- Corporate Interests: Judge Alito joined a 2-1 decision to  overturn an Environmental Protection Agency emergency cleanup  order under the Safe Drinking Water Act for cleaning toxic  pollution out of the City of Lansing, Michigan's aquifer -- the  drinking water supply for 180,000 people </p>
<p>   -- Hearing Testimony: Judge Alito did not alleviate these  concerns during his recent hearing before the Senate Committee on  the Judiciary. </p>
<p>   &quot;Americans depend upon the Supreme Court to uphold and enforce  our nation's environmental safeguards,&quot; said Buck Parker,  executive director of Earthjustice. &quot;After a careful analysis of  Judge Samuel Alito's record, we believe that he would likely side  with polluters and against citizens in disputes over  environmental protection. Judge Alito's history indicates that he  will choose his own extreme personal beliefs over the enforcement  of environmental laws.&quot; </p>
<p>   &quot;With smoggy cities, dirty rivers, mercury contaminated fish  and other threats, Americans cannot afford to confirm a Supreme  Court justice who would unfairly side with polluters,&quot; said  Sugameli. &quot;Judge Alito's nomination must be defeated.&quot; </p>
