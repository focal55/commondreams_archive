<p>WASHINGTON - July 19 - 
<p><b><a href="mailto:pappe@poli.haifa.ac.il">ILAN PAPPE</a></b>, 
<a href="http://www.zmag.org/content/showarticle.cfm?SectionID=107&ItemID=10590" target="_new">http://www.zmag.org/content/showarticle.cfm?SectionID=107&ItemID=10590</a> <br>

      Currently in Haifa, Ilan Pappe is senior lecturer in the University 
of Haifa Department of Political Science and Chair of the Emil Touma 
Institute for Palestinian Studies in Haifa. He said: "The Israeli army's 
main vision for the battlefield is today still that of 'shock and awe' 
rather than chasing snipers, suicide bombers and political activists. The 
'low intensity' war questions the invincibility of the army and erodes its 
capability to engage in a 'real' war. ... In the last week, [Israeli 
generals] have had a field day. No more random use of one-kilo bombs, 
battleships, choppers and heavy artillery. The weak and insignificant new 
minister of defense, Amir Perez, accepted without hesitation the army 
demand for crushing the Gaza strip and grinding Lebanon to dust. But it may 
not be enough. It can still deteriorate into a full-scale war with the 
hapless army of Syria, and [the generals] may even push by provocative 
actions towards such an eventuality. And, if you believe what you read in 
the local press here, it may even escalate into a long-distance war with 
Iran, backed by a supreme American umbrella. ... It is not too late to stop 
the Israeli designs from creating a new and terrible reality on the ground. 
But the window of opportunity is very narrow and the world needs to take 
action before it is too late."
      Pappe is author of "Ethnic Cleansing of Palestine," scheduled for 
publication this fall.

<p><b><a href="mailto:rcd48@cox.net">ROBERT DREYFUSS</a></b>, <a href="http://www.robertdreyfuss.com" target="_new">http://www.robertdreyfuss.com</a>, <a href="http://www.tompaine.com/articles/2006/07/17/neocons_rise_from_mideast_ashes.php%20" target="_new">http://www.tompaine.com/articles/2006/07/17/neocons_rise_from_mideast_ashes.php

    Author of the recent book "Devil's Game: How the United States Helped 
Unleash Fundamentalist Islam," Dreyfuss said: "Israel's actions in no way 
can be seen as a legitimate response to the small-scale attacks from Hamas 
and Hezbollah. Instead, what Israel has done has used the pretext of those 
pin-prick attacks -- a couple of border raids and a handful of errant 
rockets -- to launch a strategic attack whose goals are to crush Hamas and 
the remaining institutions of Palestinian self-rule and decapitate and 
destroy Hezbollah politically and militarily in Lebanon. Second, it's clear 
that Israel would never have launched this war without having made the 
calculation that it would win the support of the United States. ... Third, 
by invading and bombing Lebanon and acting brutally to crush the 
Palestinian Authority, Israel has created a unified field theory of the 
Middle East's crises, uniting the escalating world showdown with Iran, the 
unraveling civil war in Iraq, the crisis over Syria's role in Lebanon, and 
the Arab-Israeli conflict itself into one big tangle.
<p> "Until last week, before Israel went to war, the neoconservatives 
were losing across the board. They watched in horror as the war in Iraq 
faltered, and they were appalled by President Bush's Condi-led opening to 
Iran. Indeed, to many it seemed as if the entire post-9/11 project to 
remake the Middle East and build American hegemony on that cornerstone was 
in jeopardy. ... Now that Israel is at war, they have the chance once again 
to go on the offensive, against Iran, in Iraq, against Syria and against 
the mythical Terrorist International that they warn about so regularly."

 A specialist in Israeli-Iranian relations, Parsi wrote the article 
"Israel Readies for Iran Showdown by Attacking Lebanon." He said: 
"Recalling Hezbollah's close ties to Iran and Syria, both Washington and 
Tel Aviv argue that the recent clashes must have the support and blessing 
of these two states. ... Such a conclusion rests on the assumption that 
Tehran and Hezbollah could have predicted Israel's reaction to the ambush 
and kidnaping of two Israeli soldiers. ... Israel's heavy-handed response, 
which risks embroiling the entire region in a war, is rather unprecedented 
and unlikely to have been predicted by Hezbollah, despite Israel's shelling 
of the Gaza strip after Palestinian fighters took an Israeli soldier prisoner."
<p>Parsi added: "An overextended United States may embolden Israel's 
enemies, who may be tempted to test Israel's resolve and ability to uphold 
its tough posture. Through its crushing response and by expanding the 
conflict, Israel seeks to conceal this potential vulnerability and signal 
the Arabs to abandon any adventurous ideas that the U.S. difficulties in 
Iraq may have given them."

of Iran, Israel and the United States," scheduled for publication next year.
