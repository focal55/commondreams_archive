<p>WASHINGTON - August 29 - Median household income  rose modestly in 2005, while the poverty rate remained unchanged.   For the first time on record, median income was lower in the  fourth year of an economic recovery, and poverty was higher, than  when the last recession hit bottom and the recovery began,  according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. </p>
<p>   Median income remained $243 below its level in the recession  year of 2001, while the poverty rate, at 12.6 percent, remained  well above its 11.7 percent rate in 2001.  In addition, both the  number and the percentage of Americans who lack health insurance  climbed again and remained much higher than in 2001.  Four  million more people were poor, and 5.4 million more were  uninsured, than in 2001.  The percentage of children who are  uninsured rose in 2005 for the first time since 1998. </p>
<p>   &quot;Four years into an economic recovery, the country has yet to  make progress in reducing poverty, raising the typical family's  income, or stemming the rise in the ranks of the uninsured,  compared to where we were in the last recession,&quot; Center  Executive Director Robert Greenstein said. </p>
<p>   The 1.1 percent increase in median income in 2005, which was  well below the average gain for a recovery year, was driven by a  rise in income among elderly households.  Median income for non- elderly households (those headed by someone under 65) fell again  in 2005, declining by $275, or 0.5 percent.  Median income for  non-elderly households was $2,000 (or 3.7 percent) lower in 2005  than in 2001. </p>
<p>   In addition, the median earnings of both male and female full- time workers declined in 2005.  Median earnings for men working  full time throughout the year fell for the second straight year,  dropping by $774, or 1.8 percent, after adjusting for inflation.   The median earnings of full-time year-round female workers fell  for the third straight year, declining by $427, or 1.3 percent. </p>
<p>   The poor also became poorer.  The amount by which the average  person who is poor fell below the poverty line ($3,236) in 2005  was the highest on record, as was the share of the poor who fell  below half of the poverty line. </p>
<p>   Ranks of the Uninsured Rise Again </p>
<p>   The number of uninsured people climbed by 1.3 million in 2005  to 46.6 million -- also setting a new record -- while the  percentage without insurance rose from 15.6 percent to 15.9  percent.  Both figures were far above the figures for the 2001  recession year, when 41.2 million people -- 14.6 percent of the  population - were uninsured. </p>
<p>   The number of children who are uninsured rose by 360,000 to  8.3 million, climbing from 10.8 percent of children in 2004 to  11.2 percent in 2005. </p>
<p>   Results Disappointing for this Stage of an Economic Recovery </p>
<p>   &quot;It is unprecedented in recoveries of the last 40 years,&quot;  Greenstein noted, &quot;for poverty to be higher, and the typical  household's income lower, four years into a recovery than when  the previous recession hit bottom.&quot; </p>
<p>   Greenstein observed that, &quot;These disappointing figures on  median income and poverty are the latest evidence that the  economic growth of the past few years has had an unusually  limited reach.  Many middle- and low-income families are not  sharing in the gains.&quot; </p>
<p>   In related findings that underscore the unevenness of the  current economic recovery, data recently issued by the Commerce  Department show that a smaller share of the gains from the  current economic recovery are going to workers' wages and  salaries, and a larger share are going to corporate profits, than  in any other recovery since World War II. </p>
<p>   Little Cause for Optimism in 2006 </p>
<p>   Developments so far in 2006 do not offer much cause for  optimism.  Job growth has been slightly slower so far in 2006  than in 2005.  In addition, in the first quarter of 2006, wages  and salaries reached their lowest level on record as a share of  the economy. </p>
