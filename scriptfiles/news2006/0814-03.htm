<p>WASHINGTON - August 14 - <p>   Tuesday, Aug. 15, WakeUpWalMart.com's "2006 Change Wal-Mart, Change America" national bus tour will visit Cedar Rapids, Iowa, as part of the tour's five-day swing through Iowa. The tour is an exciting and unprecedented national bus tour going to 19 states and 35 cities in 35 days with one mission -- to change Wal-Mart and change America for the better.</p>
<p>   In Cedar Rapids, as part of the tour, on Tuesday, Aug. 15,  at 3 p.m., the Linn County Courthouse, 50 Third Avenue Bridge,  Sen. Evan Bayh (D-Ind.) will hold a press conference to call on  Wal-Mart, America's largest private employer, to change into a  responsible corporate citizen that lessens the burden on  taxpayers, helps protect American jobs, and provides affordable  health care.</p>
<p>   At the press conference, the speakers, including  representatives from Change-to-Win unions, will discuss why large  profitable corporations, like Wal-Mart, must lessen the burden on  taxpayers and provide affordable health care to their workers.  The speakers  will also emphasize the need, for the sake of a  better America, that Wal-Mart change its business practices which  ship good paying, middle-class manufacturing jobs overseas, leave  hundreds of thousands of families uninsured, and cost Iowan  taxpayers, and all Americans, an estimated $2.5 billion annually.</p>
<p>   At the event, U.S. Sen. Evan Bayh will also sign the "Better  America Pledge." By signing the 8-foot by 6-foot patriotic card,  U.S. Sen. Evan Bayh will pledge to fight for affordable health  care for all, living wages, American jobs, and a safe and just  workplace.</p>
<p>   As an added visual, the "2006 Change Wal-Mart, Change America"  National Bus will be on display.  The 45-foot long, fully wrapped  bus (more like an enormous sized billboard), nicknamed "Smiley,"  is wrapped side-to-side and front-to-back in patriotic colors,  emblazoned with the American flag, and the name of the tour,  "2006 Change Wal-Mart, Change America Tour." In addition, on each  side of the bus, the message of the tour will be available for  all to see -- including "Join America's Fight for Health Care."</p>
