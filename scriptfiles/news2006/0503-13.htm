<p>WASHINGTON - May 3 - Two dozen college graduates and parents organized by the Campaign for America's Future marched through the halls of Congress today in graduation caps and gowns to deliver "diplomas" to <b>House Majority Leader John Boehner</b>, R-Ohio. The diplomas were signed by more than ten thousand people who want to make college more affordable.</p>

<p style="font-size: 12px">The Campaign for America's Future collected more than fifteen thousand signatures from students and parents across the country on a petition urging Rep. Boehner to support new legislation by <b>Sen. Dick Durbin</b>, D-Ill., and <b>Rep. George Miller</b>, D-Calif., designed to cut interest rates in half on college loans. The petition included signatures from every state.</p>

<p style="font-size: 12px">Today's "graduation procession" of students and parents was in response to public outrage about higher student loan rates and the rising cost of college. Rep. Boehner led efforts to pass the largest cuts to student aid in our nation’s history.</p>

<p style="font-size: 12px">Using the slogan "Reverse the Raid," organizations representing millions of students, parents and recent college graduates are mobilizing the public in different ways around the rising cost of college. Groups are reaching out to their members, releasing reports, launching online campaigns, communicating with the public, and holding events at dozens of college campuses and in hundreds of communities this year to ensure that the more than 18 million Americans who seek to pursue a college education can afford it, according to organizers.</p>

<p style="font-size: 12px">The House approved a measure earlier this year that failed to invest in a college education for America's students and families while giving breaks to for-profit colleges. Congress recently passed a measure that slashed almost $12 billion in federal student aid to pay for massive tax breaks to millionaires, putting college further out of reach for millions of families. And earlier this year, the president proposed further cuts to higher education programs in his FY 2007 budget.</p>
