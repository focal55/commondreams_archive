<p>WASHINGTON - October 3 - As the U.S. faces a growing shortage of nurses willing to work in hospitals, today's attempt by the National Labor Relations Board to deny nurses legal protection when they form unions would undermine the quality of health care in our nation's hospitals (to view court documents, visit <a href="http://www.valuecarevaluenurses.org/docUploads/Oakwood_decision.pdf">www.valuecarevaluenurses.org/docUploads/Oakwood_decision.pdf</a>).</p>

<p>If allowed to stand, the NLRB rulings would undermine efforts by nurses to address the shortage of bedside nurses by uniting at work to improve working conditions and patient care standards.&#160; With a growing and aging population, the U.S. Department of Labor projects 1.2 million registered nurses will be needed by 2014 to fill both new and vacant slots.&#160;</p>

<p>"The Bush Administration's rulings are bad for nurses and their families, bad for patients, and comes at a time when we are already struggling to attract nurses back to the bedside to provide the quality care our patients deserve," said Mary Kay Henry, Executive Vice President, SEIU. "That's why we're calling on hospital employers to respect our freedom to unite for a voice in decisions that affect their patients and their future."</p>

<p>By joining together in a union, nurses have been able to hold hospitals and nursing homes accountable to their staff and their patients by negotiating higher wages and benefits to attract nurses to the profession, better staffing ratios to keep nurses and patients safe, and a guaranteed voice for working with management and other staff to address issues affecting quality patient care.</p>

<p>"Today's rulings only make RNs more committed than ever to uniting nurses," said Diane Sosne, an RN from Washington State with more than 35 years experience and President of the Nurse Alliance of SEIU. "As frontline caregivers we know that it's up to us to work together to find real solutions that will put patients first and raise standards for our profession. That's what we've been doing for years in the Nurse Alliance of SEIU, and it won't stop now."&#160;</p>

<p>Thousands of union and non-union nurses are already finding new ways to work together through the Nurse Alliance of SEIU to find solutions in their hospitals, in state and federal legislatures, and in their communities to address the growing patient care crisis.&#160; In March, nurses unveiled a new study, <em>Solving the Nursing Shortage through Higher Wages</em>, from the Institute for Women's Policy Research, revealing the role inadequate pay and difficult working conditions play in driving nurses from the bedside and showing how raising nurse salaries will help to draw more nurses to the profession.&#160; The report also shows that union nurses make 13% more than their non-union counterparts, and in some cities as much as 28%.</p>

<p>The Nurse Alliance of SEIU is one of the nation's largest nurse organizations and part of the nation's largest and fastest-growing health care workers union.&#160;</p>
