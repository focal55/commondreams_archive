<p>SAN FRANCISCO - December 19 - The nation’s oldest and largest grassroots environmental group is proud to announce the launch of a weekly radio show called Sierra Club Radio, a half hour program that will be broadcast in the San Francisco Bay Area and available nationally on the Web and via podcast. Sierra Club Radio is designed to help meet the mounting demand for "green" news -- information Americans can use as consumers, as citizens, as neighbors and parents to make responsible choices and to connect to the growing environmental community.</P>

<P>"Sierra Club Radio has something green for everyone," said Carl Pope, the Club’s Executive Director. "Whether you want tips for how to ‘green’ your holiday season, or stories that showcase solutions in action and interviews with environmental newsmakers, Sierra Club radio will inspire you."</P>

<P>The show will be hosted by the Sierra Club’s Orli Cotel, and will air on the Bay Area’s Air America affiliate, 960am The Quake, at 3:30 pm on Saturdays, as well as webcast at http://www.sierraclubradio.org. Cotel, who also is a contributing writer to Sierra Magazine, is already known for her nationally syndicated radio column on Air America. </P>

<P>The show will spotlight in-depth conversations with a wide range of environmental experts and activists, artists, filmmakers, and authors inspired by nature. It will also feature Sierra Club content - including lifestyle tips from <I>Sierra</I> magazine's Green Life editor Jennifer Hattam and Mr. Green, Bob Schildgen; in-depth interviews with Sierra Club Books authors and contributors to <I>Sierra</I> magazine; and political observations and commentary by Executive Director Carl Pope. The program will also highlight stories from the Sierra Club’s conservation work and grassroots fieldwork. </P>

<P>In the coming year, the Sierra Club will be making segments available for syndication, including the weekly "Ask Mr. Green" and "Green Living Tips" features. </P>

<P>The radio show comes on the heels of the first successful season of Sierra Club Chronicles, a half-hour television show featuring profiles in environmental courage, and broadcast nationwide on LinkTV. </P>
