<P>WASHINGTON - June 16 - As the debate over the war in Iraq continued on the House floor today, Congressman Dennis J. Kucinich (D-OH) gave the following floor speech.
<p>“Our soldiers are killing insurgents.&nbsp; Insurgents are killing our soldiers.&nbsp;&nbsp; Iraq’s Prime Minister is said to have considered amnesty for the growing number of insurgents, ‘as long as their hands weren’t stained by Iraqi blood.’&nbsp; This kind of talk will only encourage more aggression against US troops, more US casualties, more US deaths.&nbsp; </p>
<p>“Our soldiers are sitting ducks in a shooting gallery. If we really cared about them we would bring them home. </p>
<p>“Iraq’s leaders will ultimately seek peace and reconciliation with its diverse armed groups through renouncing the US presence. </p>
<p>“Yet, we are building permanent bases in Iraq.</p>
<p>“It is time for our nation to seek truth and reconciliation over 9/11 and the war in Iraq.&nbsp; Otherwise our national agenda will continue to be held captive in Iraq. </p>
<p>“The Bible says, ‘You shall know the truth, and the truth will set you free’. </p>
<p>“The truth is Iraq had nothing to do with 9/11. Iraq did not have weapons of mass destruction.</p>
<p>“The truth is in the name of fighting terrorism we are creating more terrorists. </p>
<p>“You shall know the truth, and the truth will set you free. We must free ourselves from this war. We must reconcile with those who wrongly took us into Iraq. </p>
<p>“We must seek the truth.”</p>
