<p>WASHINGTON - July 17 - 

Former secretary of state of Canada for Asia Pacific and human rights lawyer report on their independent investigation into China's organ harvesting from prisoners of conscience 

<p><b>WHO:</b> 

<p>-- David Kilgour, former secretary of state of Canada for Asia Pacific<br>


-- David Matas, international human rights lawyer, Canada 
<p>
<b>WHEN:</b> Thursday, July 20 from 9:30 a.m. to 10:15 a.m.
<p>
<b>WHERE:</b> Holeman Lounge, National Press Club, 529 14th St. NW, 13th Floor, Washington, D.C.
<p>
<b>DETAILS:</b> Kilgour, a former prosecutor, was a long-serving member of Canadian House of Commons, chair of Human Rights Subcommittee and served in the Canadian Cabinet. Matas is a highly-respected human rights attorney in Canada. After a two- month independent investigation into China's organ harvesting practice, they have published their findings: "Report into Allegations of Organ Harvesting of Falun Gong Practitioners in China." They will meet with the press in Washington, D.C. to discuss their findings. 

<p>The 46-page report concludes:

<blockquote>"We have come to the regrettable conclusion that the allegations are true. We believe that there has been and continues today to be large scale organ seizures from unwilling Falun Gong practitioners. Their vital organs, including hearts, kidneys, livers, and corneas, were virtually simultaneously seized for sale at high prices, sometimes to foreigners, who normally face long waits for voluntary donations of such organs in their home countries."
</blockquote>
<p>The Kilgour-Matas report in English and French is available at <a href="http://investigation.redirectme.net" target="_new">http://investigation.redirectme.net</a>.
