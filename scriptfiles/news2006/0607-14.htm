WASHINGTON - June 7 - MoveOn.org Political  Action launched a new television ad today charging four  Representatives with voting to protect war profiteers like  Halliburton.  The launch coincided with rallies outside of the  Members' offices where local veterans joined MoveOn members to  demand the return of thousands in defense contractor  contributions.</p>
<p>   "At a time when our soldiers' lack of body armor was a  national scandal, and most of us were worrying about the safety  of our troops, these Congressmen and women's attention was  focused on letting war profiteers like Halliburton off the hook  for overcharging our military and defrauding American taxpayers,?  said Eli Pariser, executive director of MoveOn Political Action. </p>
<p>   "Even our troops in Iraq are subject to the effects of  Washington's culture of corruption. These Members, who took tens  of thousands in campaign contributions from defense contractors,  protected them from stiffer penalties for war profiteering.  It's  an outrage because every dollar that Halliburton took through  fraud could have gone to our Army and our troops," said Eli  Pariser, executive director of MoveOn Political Action.   </p>
<p>   At the four rallies, hundreds of MoveOn members gathered  petition signatures and held up large signs and giant yellow  ribbons with a message to the Congressman: "Support Our Troops,  Not Halliburton."  </p>
<p>   Today's launch is the third in a series of MoveOn.org  Political Action's "Caught Red-Handed" television ads slated to  run through June 16th.  The group is spending over $300,000 to  run the ad on stations in the four districts.</p>
