<p>WASHINGTON - April 6 - Commercial Alert applauded new bi-partisan <A 
href="http://www.commercialalert.org/cnpsclpa.pdf">legislation</A> in Congress 
to restrict the sale of junk food in public schools.&nbsp; The Child Nutrition 
Promotion and School Lunch Protection Act would expand the definition of &#8220;food 
of minimal nutritional value,&#8221; and empower the U.S. Department of Agriculture 
(USDA) to stop the sale of unhealthy foods everywhere in school &#8211; not just in 
school cafeterias.<BR><BR>&#8220;Our children are suffering from an obesity epidemic, 
but federal laws governing the sale of food in schools are a junk food 
manufacturer&#8217;s dream,&#8221; said Gary Ruskin, executive director of Commercial Alert, 
a nonprofit corporate watchdog group.&nbsp; &#8220;It&#8217;s time for Congress to wake up 
and take the childhood obesity problem seriously.&#8221;<BR><BR>&#8220;Three cheers for this 
new bill, which puts the interests of children ahead of the profits of the junk 
food industry,&#8221; Ruskin said. &#8220;If Congress cares about children, it will swiftly 
turn this bill into law.&#8221;<BR><BR>The federal definition of &#8220;food of minimal 
nutritional value&#8221; is extremely narrow. It includes only sodas, water ices, 
chewing gum, and candies made mostly of sugar. Still worse, the USDA can only 
stop the sale of these foods during meal times in cafeterias -- not in vending 
machines elsewhere in schools, or in school stores.<BR><BR>In June 2005, the 
USDA rejected Commercial Alert&#8217;s <A 
href="http://www.commercialalert.org/fmnvpetition.pdf">petition</A> to enforce 
the competitive foods rule, which prohibits public schools from selling &#8220;food of 
minimal nutritional value&#8221; during mealtimes in school cafeterias.<BR><BR>In 
2003, Commercial Alert, backed by dozens of endorsing organizations and 
prominent scholars, started a campaign in support of the <A 
href="http://www.commercialalert.org/cop.pdf">Childhood Obesity Prevention 
Agenda</A>, to help stop the childhood obesity epidemic by banning the 
marketing, distribution and sale of junk food in schools, and improving the 
quality of food provided to schoolchildren.<BR><BR>Last month, in response to 
recent findings by scientists at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and 
elsewhere that certain soft drinks may contain amounts of the carcinogen benzene 
above the U.S. legal limit for drinking water, Commercial Alert and public 
health advocates sent <A 
href="http://www.commercialalert.org/news/news-releases/2006/03/benzene-in-some-soft-drinks-prompts-call-for-halt-on-sales-in-schools">letters</A> 
to all U.S. chief state school officers, asking them to stop the sale and 
marketing of these soft drinks in public schools, until they can be proven safe 
and free from benzene contamination.<BR><BR>Commercial Alert is a nonprofit 
organization based in Portland, Oregon. Our mission is to keep the commercial 
culture within its proper sphere, and to prevent it from exploiting children and 
subverting the higher values of family, community, environmental integrity and 
democracy. <!-- #EndEditable -->
