<p>BRUSSELS / GENEVA - February 3 - Opposition to genetically modified 
(GM) foods is likely to increase if the World Trade Organisation (WTO) 
rules in favour of a US-led complaint against European GM policy, 
Friends of the Earth Europe warned today. A draft WTO ruling is expected 
next week.

<p>The international environmental group accused the WTO of being 
secretive, undemocratic and biased towards business interests, and 
charged that it is the wrong institution to settle disputes of this kind.

<p>The United States, Canada and Argentina launched a trade dispute with 
the EU through the WTO in May 2003. They have been arguing that Europe's 
reluctance to embrace GM foods damaged their farmers and was a barrier 
to trade. In line with WTO secrecy, the draft ruling will only be sent 
to the countries in the dispute. A final ruling is expected later in the 
year.

<p>Friends of the Earth Europe's Trade Co-ordinator Alexandra Wandel said: 
"The World Trade Organisation should keep its hands off our food. 
Protecting Europe's wildlife, farmers and consumers from the threat of 
genetically modified crops is far more important than free trade rules. 
The WTO is secretive, undemocratic and unfair. It should not decide what 
the public eats and how we protect our environment."

<p>Adrian Bebb, GM Food Campaigner for Friends of the Earth Europe, said: 
"Opposition to genetically modified foods is likely to increase if the 
WTO decides that European safeguards should be sacrificed to benefit 
biotech corporations. The number of bans by countries in Europe against 
GM foods is increasing, and the number of regions declaring themselves 
GM Free has soared. The WTO, the US administration and biotech firms 
should stop their bullying and let Europeans decide what food we eat."

<p>Friends of the Earth has published a fact sheet and briefing on the 
dispute today [1] which highlight:

<p>. Opposition to GM foods and crops in Europe has increased since the 
beginning of the trade dispute. There are now over 170 regions and 4,500 
smaller areas that want to be GM-free.

<p>. An alternative dispute settlement procedure is needed to solve trade 
and environmental conflicts. This could be the International Court of 
Justice or the Permanent Court of Arbitration. Additionally, the UN 
Biosafety Protocol is an international agreement already in place that 
deals with trade in GM organisms. Unfortunately, the US has refused to 
sign it.

<p>. The first ten years of GM crops have failed to deliver the benefits 
promised by the biotech industry and have played no role in tackling 
poverty and hunger [2].

<p>An international campaign against the WTO dispute called "Bite-back - 
WTO: Hands off our food!" - is supported by 750 organisations 
representing some 60 million people (see www.bite-back.org). The 
coalition states that the industry-friendly WTO is not the right place 
to decide what food Europeans should eat.

<p>The "Bite Back" citizens' objection was initiated by Friends of the 
Earth International with the support of consumer, development and 
farmers' groups, trade unions, research institutes and citizens from 
over 100 countries.
