"Secretary of the Interior Dirk Kempthorne’s announcement today of a national parks Centennial Challenge brings welcome attention to the needs of these imperiled treasures. We are grateful and appreciative of this tremendous opportunity and for this critical first step to ensuring that the parks are preserved for their 100th anniversary—and for generations to come. 

<P>"A significant investment in our national parks during the next 10 years, leading to the parks’ centennial in 2016, would help the National Park Service address some of the parks’ most pressing needs. New money could ensure that these natural and cultural treasures are protected and that national park rangers are no longer an endangered species. 

 

<P>"Our national parks today are facing crippling funding needs in excess of $600 million annually—a shortfall that we know is getting larger every day. We need seasonal rangers to tell America’s stories, and year-round park staff to ensure visitor safety and the preservation of our natural and cultural heritage. We need funding to maintain trails and visitor facilities, restore historic sites and natural landscapes, and protect cultural artifacts and wildlife. It is time for a significant investment in our national parks as we embark on this 10-year challenge leading up to their 100th anniversary. 

 

<P>"We look forward to working with Secretary Kempthorne, the Administration, and Congress to see this important committment carried through, and to finally restore the faded glory of America's national parks."
