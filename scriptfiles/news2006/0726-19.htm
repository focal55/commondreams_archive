<p>WASHINGTON - July 26 - Today the US House of Representatives passed three proposals to extend permanent protection to a total of more than 670,000 acres of wilderness in California, Idaho and Oregon. If enacted, these bills would provide permanent protection to some of the most important unspoiled landscapes in each state.

<p><b>California</b>
<p>The Northern California Coastal Wild Heritage Wilderness Act, HR 233, would protect 289,000 acres of wilderness and 21 miles of the Black Butte River as wild and scenic. All of the lands in the bill are in the northwest corner of California, stretching from the Oregon border to Napa County. The bill is championed in the US House by Rep. Mike Thompson (D-CA), who represents all of the areas included.

<p>"This bill will protect some of the finest remaining wild places in all of California. We hope the Senate will act quickly to pass this proposal and send it to the President," said Sara Barth, California / Nevada Regional Director of The Wilderness Society.

<p>The Senate passed the companion bill, S. 128, in July of 2005 with the backing of Senators Barbara Boxer (D-CA) and Dianne Feinstein (D-CA). Changes were made to the proposal as it headed to the House floor so the bill now goes back to the Senate for consideration, since the House and Senate have passed different versions of the bill.

<p><b>Idaho</b>
<p>The Central Idaho Economic Development and Recreation Act, HR 3603, would protect more than 310,000 acres of wilderness in central Idaho’s Boulder-White Cloud Mountains. This proposal is championed by Rep. Simpson (R-ID).

<p>Craig Gehrke, Idaho Regional Director of The Wilderness Society said, “We welcome this action by the House of Representatives to protect the Boulder-White Clouds. This is the most significant step forward to protect Idaho’s wilderness since the passage of the Central Idaho Wilderness Act in the 1980. We look forward to prompt action on the Boulder-White Clouds in the Senate. We appreciate Congressman Simpson’s leadership to protect the White Clouds.”

<p><b>Oregon</b>
<p>The Mount Hood Stewardship Legacy Act, HR 5025, would protect 77,500 acres of wilderness on Mt. Hood and 26 miles of wild and scenic rivers. The bill was crafted by Congressmen Greg Walden (R-OR) and Earl Blumenauer (D-OR). The areas included in the bill contain ancient forests, key wildlife areas, and provide a wealth of recreational opportunities for Oregonians and Americans. Mount Hood is a regional icon and well known nationally.

<p>“Although not much time remains in this congressional session, I think the strong bi-partisan effort that went into drafting this bill will help speed its way through the Senate,” said Bob Freimark, Senior Policy Analyst for The Wilderness Society’s Pacific Northwest office. “Senators Wyden and Smith now have a great opportunity to add additional areas for protection, and make the bill even stronger.”

<p>“Each of these wilderness bills is the product of years of hard work and difficult negotiations. As a result, each contains unique provisions that we would not have written ourselves, including some which we would not support in another time and place,” said Bill Meadows, President of The Wilderness Society. “Nevertheless, we enthusiastically celebrate what they all have in common: permanent protection for hundreds of thousands of acres of pristine, unspoiled, natural lands for all Americans to enjoy.”

<p>Since 1935, The Wilderness Society has led national efforts to preserve America’s wildest public lands to ensure that future generations will enjoy, as we do today, the clean air and water, wildlife, beauty, and opportunities for recreation and renewal that pristine forests, rivers, deserts, and mountains provide. The Wilderness Society has over 250,000 members and supporters nationwide.

<p>Wilderness designations permanently protect wild and unspoiled lands within National Forests, National Parks, National Wildlife Refuges, and other federal public lands for recreation, wildlife habitat, watershed and other important purposes, including hunting and fishing. To preserve their unspoiled, pristine character, wilderness designations prohibit logging, mining, oil and gas development, and construction of power lines and roads in federally designated wilderness areas. Motorized and mechanized vehicles are also not permitted.
