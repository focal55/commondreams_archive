<p>ANN ARBOR, Michigan - February 17 - On Friday February 17 at 4:45 pm, members of Michigan Peaceworks’ Youth Activist Network will gather at the Federal Building for a “spy-in.”  Participants will dress in vintage, Hollywood-style spy clothing (fedoras, trenchcoats, and sunglasses) and engage in mock surveillance of the Federal Building. The satirical event is designed to highlight the abuse of executive power at the core of the President’s domestic eavesdropping program.

<p>The “spy-in” brings together members of Michigan Peaceworks’ Youth Activist Network from nine different area high schools, joined by students from the University of Michigan and members of the wider community. The event is intended to be a peaceful consciousness raising demonstration, and security officials have been notified in advance in order to ensure that everything runs smoothly.

<p>The issue of domestic eavesdropping, and civil liberties in general, has been identified as a priority by the Youth Activist Council (the body comprised of students representing each participating high school). Seth Buchsbaum, leader of Huron High Peaceworks, stated, "The youth are the voters and politicians of tomorrow.  If we can't stand up for our rights now, who's to say we can later?"

<p>The demonstration against warrant-less wiretapping comes as the Bush Administration faces mounting criticism for operating outside the bounds of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) of 1978.  An Associated Press poll shows that 56 percent of Americans believe that the administration should not conduct domestic surveillance without obtaining warrants as established by FISA. 

<p>In a resolution published on Monday, January 13, the American Bar Association joined a chorus of voices in urging the administration to reconsider its position. The ABA passed a resolution stating, in part, “The American Bar Association calls upon the President to abide by the limitations which the Constitution imposes on a president under our system of checks and balances and respect the essential roles of the Congress and the judicial branch in ensuring that our national security is protected in a manner consistent with constitutional guarantees.”  In a letter to the President accompanying the resolution, the ABA wrote, “We join with you in the conviction that terrorism must be fought with the utmost vigor, but we also believe we must ensure this fight is conducted in a manner reflective of the highest American values.”

<p>The administration has defended its policies with claims that the process of obtaining a warrant is difficult and time-consuming.  These claims contradict the facts: that warrants can be obtained retroactively if need be, and that fewer than ten warrants (out of thousands requested) have been denied in the entire history of the program. As Bob Herbert stated in the New York Times on 2-7-06, “The most logical reason for not getting a warrant is that the president’s intelligence acolytes…have not been able to demonstrate that the people being spied upon are connected to al-Qaida or any other terror organization.”

<p>The “spy-in” is part of a series of events sponsored by Michigan Peaceworks’ Youth Activist Network. Other events included a Youth Peace Summit, Youth Peace Night, youth feeder march in last September’s “Stop the War” demonstration and a Cultural Diversity Workshop.  Members of the Network work within their schools to reform military recruitment policies, conduct educational events, and hold vigils to raise awareness about peace and justice issues. The Spy-in idea emerged from the inaugural meeting of the Youth Activist Council on February 4, which brought together members of each club for networking and strategy sharing.  The student activists share a passion for peace and working towards a more just society.  

<p>Michigan Peaceworks, founded in 2001, is a grassroots organization dedicated to peace, democracy, civil rights, and civil liberties. The organization undertakes education and action on local and state levels to influence U.S. foreign and domestic policy.
