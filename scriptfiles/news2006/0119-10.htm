<p>WASHINGTON - January 19 - The recently completed confirmation hearing for Supreme Court nominee Samuel Alito confirmed that he is the wrong choice for the Supreme Court and for the country, according to a People For the American Way post-hearing report (link) released today.

 

         <p>   “Samuel Alito spent his confirmation hearing refusing to give senators and the American public clear and honest answers to the most important questions about his record and judicial philosophy,” said People For the American Way President Ralph G. Neas.  “This was Judge Alito’s one opportunity to explain his record and judicial philosophy before the Senate decides whether to give him a lifetime position with great power over our laws and liberties.  He used that opportunity to evade and mislead the Senate and the American public.”

 

         <p>   The report released today documents Judge Alito’s troubling, evasive and misleading answers on questions vital to Americans’ rights and interests: unchecked presidential and executive branch power, congressional authority to protect Americans, privacy and reproductive rights, and his long record of favoring powerful institutions over individuals in civil rights and other cases.

 

         <p>   “Samuel Alito is a dangerous threat to the Constitution and the rights it protects,” said Neas.  “His testimony reflects the same disregard for our system of checks and balances that makes his views of unchecked presidential power so troubling.  His confirmation would lead to constitutional catastrophe.”

 

<p>“Samuel Alito must not be confirmed to the Supreme Court,” said Neas. “The debate on the Alito nomination has just begun.”
