<p>WASHINGTON - June 8 - As the Senate Judiciary 
Committee prepared to consider legislation today that would effectively approve 
the warrantless spying on Americans by the National Security Agency, the 
American Civil Liberties Union expressed its strong disapproval that lawmakers 
appear ready to accept unprecedented and unconstitutional claims of presidential 
powers.&nbsp; On Tuesday, Chairman Arlen 
Specter (R-PA) declined to order a hearing with leaders from telecommunications 
firms to investigate their involvement with the illegal program.&nbsp;
<P>&#8220;Chairman Specter&#8217;s current course of 
&#8216;action&#8217; in effect surrenders the right of Congress to investigate and oversee 
this illegal spying program to the Vice President,&#8221; said Caroline Fredrickson, 
Director of the ACLU Washington Legislative Office. &#8220;By calling off the telecom 
hearing in exchange for a vague promise from Vice President Cheney to &#8216;take a 
look&#8217; at surveillance legislation written by Specter, Chairman Specter gives the 
White House far too much power over the legislative process.&nbsp; Congress must assert its independence 
and be a check on the president, not a rubberstamp.&#8221;</P>
<P>The ACLU has urged Congress to delay 
consideration of legislation related to the warrantless NSA spying until 
Congress has a clear understanding of the scope of the program.&nbsp; On Tuesday, the chairman refused to 
notice a hearing with telecom executives and announced that he would not press 
for subpoenas while the Vice President considered whether his legislation 
infringed on the inherent presidential powers the administration claims 
exist.&nbsp; At that meeting, Senate 
Specter indicated that the committee would defer to the Vice President&#8217;s 
objection to holding hearings with telecommunications companies or other 
witnesses.&nbsp; </P>
<P>However, on Wednesday, Senator Specter sent a 
letter to Vice President Cheney voicing his concerns with both the 
administration&#8217;s unwillingness to cooperate with the committee and attempts, by 
Cheney himself, to pressure members of the Senate Judiciary Committee from 
meeting their Constitutional requirements to conduct meaningful 
oversight.</P>
<P>&#8220;This is turning into a partisan whitewash of 
administration wrongdoing,&#8221; said Fredrickson.&nbsp; &#8220;Our government was designed to have 
separate branches &#8211; each with its own function and role.&nbsp; Sadly, this executive has usurped power 
&#8211; and has done so with the blessing of the majority in the national 
legislature.&nbsp; We hope that Senator 
Specter will hold the administration accountable for their obstruction and 
interference.&#8221;</P>
<P>The committee today is expected to consider 
several pieces of legislation regarding the illegal NSA spying program 
authorized by President Bush.&nbsp; Both 
Senators Arlen Specter (R-PA) and Mike DeWine (R-OH) had introduced bills that 
would effectively ratify the NSA&#8217;s illegal eavesdropping on Americans.&nbsp; In addition, Senator Dianne Feinstein 
(D-CA) has co-authored a bill with Senator Specter that reiterate that the NSA 
program must follow the procedures of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act 
(FISA), the law governing national security surveillance of Americans that 
provide some privacy protections. </P>
<P>Senator Specter&#8217;s &#8220;National 
Security Surveillance Act&#8221; (S.2453) would essentially end any congressional 
investigation into the warrantless NSA program by amending FISA to allow the court to approve NSA monitoring of 
Americans without any evidence they are conspiring with al Qaeda.&nbsp; </P>
<P>He also has a substitute to that legislation written to 
win administration support by amending the criminal code to allow wiretapping at 
the direction of the president without any independent check.&nbsp; This move would create a retroactive 
exception to criminal liability when warrantless wiretapping is done at the 
president&#8217;s direction under a claim of inherent authority and make future court 
review of surveillance of Americans optional.&nbsp; The bill would also permit the president 
to claim a right to conduct secret searches of American homes and businesses in 
wartime.&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>Senator DeWine&#8217;s &#8220;Terrorist Surveillance 
Program Act of 2006&#8221; (S. 2455) weakens the probable cause requirement for spying 
on ordinary Americans, makes judicial review for seeking a court order optional 
and permits the NSA to engage in its surveillance several weeks without any 
court oversight at all.&nbsp; Even after 
45 days of warrantless surveillance, it would be up to the executive branch to 
seek judicial approval or bypass it.</P>
<P>The Feinstein-Specter bill would reinforce 
the long-standing principle that electronic surveillance of Americans must be 
&#8220;conducted pursuant to individualized court orders,&#8221; as outlined in FISA and 
other federal statutes.&nbsp; The bill, 
S. 3001, the &#8220;Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Improvement and Enhancement Act 
of 2006,&#8221; would also streamline the administrative procedures used before 
seeking approval of the FISA court.</P>
<P>The ACLU has urged Congress to reject any 
attempts to amend FISA to ratify the NSA&#8217;s spying on Americans until the 
administration provides lawmakers with the information needed to conduct 
oversight.&nbsp; Thus far, the White 
House and it allies have stonewalled Congress.</P>
<P>In addition to its legislative efforts, the 
ACLU has also challenged the NSA&#8217;s warrantless wiretapping program in federal 
court.&nbsp; In legal papers submitted 
late Monday, the ACLU argued to a federal court in Detroit that the NSA's spying 
program is unconstitutional and violates FISA. &nbsp;The court will hear arguments in the case 
on Monday, June 12.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Also late Monday, the ACLU filed papers with 
the Federal Communications Commission pointing out that the agency cannot permit 
a pending merger between AT&amp;T and BellSouth without investigating the merits 
of allegations that these companies illegally provided customer information to 
the NSA.</P>
<P>&#8220;The administration has continued to conceal 
from the public critical information about its surveillance of the people in 
this country,&#8221; said Lisa Graves, ACLU Senior Counsel for Legislative 
Strategy.&nbsp; &#8220;The bills the committee 
is expected to consider would reward stonewalling by the administration and put 
a stamp of approval on an illegal program that violates Americans&#8217; right to 
privacy.&nbsp; We urge the committee to 
reject these terrible proposals that give the president a virtual blank check to 
monitor Americans.&#8221;</P>
