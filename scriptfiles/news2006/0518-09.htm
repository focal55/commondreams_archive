<p>WASHINGTON - May 18 - American Civil Liberties Union today urged the Senate Select 
Committee on Intelligence to thoroughly question General Michael V. Hayden at 
his confirmation hearing to be the new Director of the Central Intelligence 
Agency.&nbsp; Hayden was the Director of the National Security Agency when that 
agency began a warrantless program to spy on Americans and data-mine their phone 
records, and has been one of the chief advocates for this illegal monitoring of 
Americans&#8217; communications.&nbsp;
<P>&#8220;The Senate has a constitutional obligation to vigorously question this 
controversial nominee, and they should hold General Hayden&#8217;s feet to the fire,&#8221; 
said Anthony D. Romero, ACLU Executive Director.&nbsp; &#8220;We urge the committee to 
break through the stonewalling that we have seen thus far.&nbsp; The rule of law 
was broken under General Hayden&#8217;s watch and Congress is entitled to honest 
answers about what led to illegal wiretapping and how extensive the violations 
of Americans&#8217; rights have been.&#8221;</P><P>Today&#8217;s hearing follows a move by the White House to belatedly provide both 
the House and Senate intelligence committees, as required by law, with 
classified briefings on the warrantless NSA wiretapping and data-mining of 
Americans&#8217; communications.&nbsp; The ACLU noted that there must be more than 
just political appeasement to ease Hayden&#8217;s confirmation, and this initial 
briefing to the full committees must be followed by full disclosure and real 
congressional oversight.</P><P>The ACLU has also called on Inspector General Fine at the Justice Department 
to investigate that department&#8217;s involvement in illegal NSA spying 
program.&nbsp; The IG&#8217;s involvement is necessary given that the Justice 
Department&#8217;s Office of Professional Responsibility has been denied the required 
security clearances to conduct its own investigation into the warrantless 
eavesdropping program.&nbsp; Attorney General Gonzales has rejected repeated 
calls for the appointment of a special counsel to investigate the program.</P><P>In addition to the concerns surrounding the NSA&#8217;s illegal activities, the 
ACLU also urged lawmakers to question Hayden about how the CIA would respect the 
rule of law under his guidance.&nbsp; That agency also has a demonstrated 
pattern of violating federal laws, including ratified treaties, at the direction 
of the White House.&nbsp;</P><P>&#8220;This is also an opportunity for Senators to demand that the CIA uphold the 
rule of law,&#8221; said Caroline Fredrickson, Director of the ACLU Washington 
Legislative Office.&nbsp; &#8220;The practice of unlawful rendition, the torture and 
abuse of prisoners and the use of &#8216;black sites,&#8217; or secret prisons operated 
overseas, all violate the spirit and letter of our Constitution and laws.&nbsp; 
Those who oversee our nation&#8217;s intelligence agencies must have the highest 
respect and regard for our rule of law.&#8221;</P><P>The ACLU is a non-partisan organization, and takes no official position on 
Hayden&#8217;s nomination.</P><!-- #EndEditable -->
