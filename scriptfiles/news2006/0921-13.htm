<p>WASHINGTON - September 21 - League of Women Voters  National President Mary G. Wilson today strongly denounced  yesterday's House passage of the so-called &quot;Federal Election  Integrity Act&quot; (H.R. 4844). The legislation requires eligible  citizens to present government-issued, current and valid photo  identification at the polling place in 2008 and proof of  citizenship by 2010.</p>
<p>   &quot;This is a truly sad day for our nation. The House of  Representatives voted in favor of legislation that masquerades as  protection against voter identity fraud. In reality, this bill is  a means to discriminate against legal, eligible voters,&quot; said  Wilson.</p>
<p>   &quot;Any proposal that restricts voter registration or raises  barriers to voting is a fear-based approach instead of a fact- based solution,&quot; Wilson stated.  </p>
<p>   &quot;Some would have you believe that this legislation cures voter  identity fraud,&quot; continued Wilson. &quot;But there remains a lack of  evidence of instances in which voters misrepresent their identity  at the polls.&quot;</p>
<p>   &quot;It sounds good to stand on the floor of Congress and demand  equality and fairness in elections, but when one takes a closer  look behind the political smokescreen, it is clear that this  bill's restrictions will disproportionately impact those who are  least likely to have a current photo ID: the elderly, young  people, people of color, rural voters and others,&quot; said Wilson. </p>
<p>   &quot;In modern society, it is easy to assume that everyone has  appropriate ID or can prove their citizenship. But it is more  difficult than one might think,&quot; Wilson said. &quot;The costs in time  and money of obtaining proof of citizenship and photo ID would  clearly discourage voter participation.&quot;</p>
<p>   &quot;The League hopes members of the Senate will do the right  thing for all voters by voting against this legislation and a  return to the dark days of exclusion, which relied on such  measures as literacy tests and poll taxes,&quot; Wilson stated. The  league sent two letters to members of Congress over the past few  months strongly urging them to oppose H.R. 4844.</p>
<p>   &quot;Congress should not be playing politics with our right to  vote. The League and our members in communities nationwide will  work to keep this bill from passing the Senate and becoming the  law of the land,&quot; concluded Wilson.</p>
