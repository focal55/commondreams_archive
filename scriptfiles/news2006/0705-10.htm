<p>WASHINGTON - July 5 - Human Rights Campaign President Joe Solmonese made the following statement as the American Academy of Pediatrics journal published a report today finding that children of same-sex couples would benefit from marriage fairness for their parents.

<p>“The nation’s largest organization for pediatricians knows what it’s talking about: marriage is good for all families,” said Human Rights Campaign President Joe Solmonese. “The academy’s report is based on solid research showing that sexual orientation makes no difference when it comes to parenting and they aren’t alone in that finding. Every single credible child welfare organization has said that sexual orientation has nothing to do with the ability to be a good parent. It’s having a loving home that matters. We thank the American Academy of Pediatrics for publishing this important study. Lawmakers should heed the advice of the experts and give families the security they deserve under law.”

<p>The report, “The Effects of Marriage, Civil Union and Domestic Partnership Laws on the Health and Well-Being of Children,” is in the July 2006 edition of Pediatrics and was commissioned by the American Academy of Pediatrics Board of Directors. With 55,000 members, the AAP is the largest and most influential professional organization for pediatricians in the United States.
