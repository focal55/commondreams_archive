<p> WASHINGTON - March 10 - Congressman Dennis J. Kucinich (D-OH), Ranking Member of the House Government Reform Subcommittee on National Security, Emerging Threats and International Relations, today, introduced a rarely used Congressional procedure called a Resolution of Inquiry to demand documents from the Administration about the security review of the port deal that would have allowed a United Arab Emirates (UAE) company to take control of six US ports.
<p>A Resolution of Inquiry is a privileged resolution used to obtain documents from the Executive Branch. Under House rules, Kucinich’s resolution is referred to the House Financial Services Committee, and action must be taken in committee within 14 legislative days</p>
<p>Kucinich’s resolution requires the President, and the Secretary of Homeland Security, to turn over to Congress:</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>All documents in their possession regarding the December 13, 2005, Coast Guard Intelligence Coordination Center document. <br>
<br>
</li>
<li>All documents in their possession regarding discussions between the White House and Dubai Ports World relating to the Committee on Foreign Investment process for approving the acquisition.<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>All documents in their possession regarding discussions between the White House and the Carlyle Group between October 1, 2005, and March 2, 2006. </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>“The port deal is not dead,” stated Kucinich. “Much as they would like to, Congress must not allow this Administration to sweep this under the rug. Congress must fulfill its Constitutional duty and provide aggressive oversight of this ill-advised and misguided deal. Congress must continue to investigate this deal to ensure similar deals, which put the security of our nation at grave risk, can not happen again.”</p>
