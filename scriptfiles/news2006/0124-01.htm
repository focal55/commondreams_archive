<p>WASHINGTON - January 24 - Representative John Conyers, Jr., (D-MI) House Judiciary Committee Ranking Member, issued the following statement today regarding the release of the transcript from last week's Democratic Forum on domestic surveillance:

 



<p>    "I am disappointed that the President of the United States and his Attorney General are now actively campaigning for their illegal wiretap program. As usual, they are perpetuating three misconceptions about this unprecedented new authority: that it is legal, that it works, and that it is limited to terrorists. 

 

<p>      "At Democratic hearings last week, conservatives and liberals alike testified that the program is patently illegal and unconstitutional. We also heard testimony that these broad new authorities are being used against purely innocent, and constitutionally protected protest activity. As this transcript shows, the President and his entourage are the only ones singing the praises of this program in the face of unanimous opposition."
