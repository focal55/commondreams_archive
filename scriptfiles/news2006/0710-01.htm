<p>NEW YORK - July 10 - Today the Center for  Constitutional Rights (CCR) published the first report citing  declassified primary accounts from current detainees and their  American attorneys to detail torture and inhumane treatment by  U.S. officials at Guantanamo Bay prison.</p>
<p>   The &quot;Report on Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, and Degrading  Treatment of Prisoners at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba&quot; is the most  comprehensive primary source account ever published of ongoing  abuse at the prison, detailing systematic physical,  psychological, sexual, medical and religious abuse of detainees,  filling 51 pages and 279 footnotes.  The report is particularly  significant in light of the Supreme Court's recent Hamdan  decision because it catalogues conduct by U.S. officials in  violation of the Geneva Conventions, which the court applied to  detainees, and analyzes the administration's attempt to create a  &quot;legal black hole&quot; for enemy combatants in sections discussing  the administration's liability concerns regarding conduct at the  base Geneva, war crimes, and the forthcoming revisions to the  Army Field Manual.  </p>
<p>   &quot;This report authoritatively documents the Bush  Administration's systematic human rights abuses at Guantanamo.  I  think the torture and abuse detailed here will shock Congress and  the American public because it reveals a lawless, immoral and  ineffective detention facility and undermines the  administration's increasingly desperate attempts to lie about  what is happening down there,&quot; said CCR Legal Director Bill  Goodman.  &quot;This report tells a story of abuse and the betrayal of  our laws at the highest levels of government, which is why the  Supreme Court just had to step in and order the President to  treat detainees humanely and provide due process.  Before  Congress rushes to give the President cover with unnecessary new  legislation, I hope it will review the record and provide real  oversight, starting with an independent investigation of the  base,&quot; he added. </p>
<p>   The report is available at <a href="http://releases.usnewswire.com/redir.asp?ReleaseID=68939&Link=http://www.ccr-ny.org">http://www.ccr-ny.org</a>. Printed  copies are available upon request.  CCR represents over 200  detainees at Guantanamo and it won the 2004 Supreme Court decision  establishing the detainees' rights to challenge their detention. </p>
