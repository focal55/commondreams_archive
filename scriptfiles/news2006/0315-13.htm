<p>WASHINGTON - March 15 - Melanie Sloan, Executive Director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) made the following statement in response to the lackluster ethics package proposed by the House Republican Leadership today. <br />
<br />
“The new Republican lobbying reform proposal is more targeted at undercutting the financing of 527 organizations than it as at reigning in unethical behavior. This proposal, like all the others before it, fails to include any oversight or enforcement mechanisms. Mere disclosure requirements for lobbyists are not sufficient. <br />
<br />
One of the problems highlighted by the Abramoff scandal is that Members of Congress have routinely and flagrantly violated the travel and gift rules, but this proposal does nothing to curb such unethical conduct. Instead, this proposal is intended to give members cover in the mid-term elections, allowing them to claim that they voted for reforms without having to endure the indignities of commercial plane travel and paying for their own meals.”
