<p>LONDON - October 26  - Greenpeace's high profile 'Green my Apple' 
stall was shut-down today at the start of the Mac Expo (1) Organisers of 
the Mac Expo claimed they had received complaints from unnamed sources. 
The Greenpeace stall was bought for the three-day expo in an attempt to 
raise awareness about concerns over the use of toxic chemicals in 
Apple's products.

<p>The Greenpeace volunteers manning the stall were signing up Mac fans to 
challenge Apple to go green. Flyers explaining the Green my Apple 
campaign were handed out to members of the public along with organic 
green apples. The volunteers have vowed to return to the expo tomorrow 
to continue the <a href="http://www.greenmyapple.org" target="_new">'Green my Apple'</a> campaign. www.greenmyapple.org

<p>"This reaction is totally over-the-top" said Iza Kruszewska, Greenpeace 
International campaigner at the expo. "Apple refuses to address our 
criticisms on their products, both for the recycling and for the use of 
harmful chemicals. Instead of hiding their head in the sand, Apple 
should be a world leader in the greening of the electronics industry, 
not lagging behind," she continued.  

<p>Apple scored 11th place (out of 14) on a 'Guide to Greener Electronics' 
recently released by Greenpeace, with a poor showing on almost all 
criteria. (2) The company fails to embrace the precautionary principle, 
withholds its full list of regulated substances, provides no timelines 
for eliminating toxic polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and no commitment at all 
to phasing out all uses of brominated flame retardants (BFRs). (3) The 
company also performs poorly on product take back and recycling, with 
the exception of reporting on the amounts of its electronic waste recycled.

<p>"It's time for Apple to use clean components in all of its products and 
to provide a free take-back program to reuse and recycle its products 
wherever they are sold. We are challenging the world leader in design to 
also be a world leader in environmental innovation.  We challenge Apple 
to have a product range on the market by 2007 which is free of the worst 
toxic chemicals," she concluded.
