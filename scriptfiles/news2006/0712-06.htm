<p>WASHINGTON - July 12 - The Humane Society of the United States continued to promote the boycott of Canadian seafood today with yet another full page advertisement appearing in the New York <i>Times</i>. The ad, depicting the clubbing of seals, renews the organization's boycott campaign to pressure the Canadian government to stop the annual slaughter of hundreds of thousands of baby seals for their fur. The advertisement thanks major restaurants and seafood distributors that have signed on, including Down East Seafood and Prime Seafood, and calls for other establishments to join. 

<p>"We are excited to continue our aggressive ad campaign to bring our message to the Canadian government and the public that the boycott will not go away until the seal hunt is canceled for good," said Dr. John W. Grandy, senior vice president of The HSUS. "We are encouraging everyone to join the hundreds of chefs, restaurants, and companies who have already committed not to buy snow crabs or other Canadian seafood until the seals are safe." 

<p>Sealing is an off-season activity conducted by commercial fishermen from Canada's East Coast. Even in Newfoundland, where more than 90 percent of the sealers live, sealing income accounts for less than 1 percent of that province's gross domestic product and only 2 percent of the landed value of Newfoundland's fishery. More than two-thirds of Canadian seafood is exported to the United States, producing $2.8 billion annually for the Canadian economy and making the industry a viable target for a boycott. 

<p>Since the launch of the seafood boycott by The HSUS in March 2005, the value of Canadian snow crab exports to the United States has dropped by $158 million CAD compared to the same time frame in the previous year -- a 32 percent decline. 

<p>A list of all companies supporting the Protect Seals boycott of Canadian seafood is available at <a href="http://www.RestaurantsForSeals.org" target="_new">www.RestaurantsForSeals.org</a>.
