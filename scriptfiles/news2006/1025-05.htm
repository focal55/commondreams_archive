<p>WASHINGTON - October 25 - 
<p>NOMI PRINS, <a href="mailto:NomiPrins@msn.com">NomiPrins@msn.com</a>, <a href="http://www.thenation.com/doc/20061030/prins" target="_new">http://www.thenation.com/doc/20061030/prins</a>
<p>Author of the piece "How the Republicans Can Manipulate Oil 
Prices for Political Gain," Prins said today: "Since their August 
highs, oil prices dropped from $77 to $59 per barrel. Gas prices have 
fallen from an average of $3.04 to $2.25 per gallon. In a September 
USA Today poll 42 percent of Americans thought there was a direct 
connection between the Republicans wanting to keep control of 
Congress and gas prices falling.

<p>"Free-market types went to town. Oil is set by market forces, not 
Washington, rang the unified voice of analysts. 'If only Bush had 
that kind of control,' mused White House spokesman Tony Snow. But 
subtle manipulation is a form of control. ...

<p>"An overly speculated market like oil (the most traded commodity 
in the world) picks up on subtle signs. Just as traders push the 
market up, they can take it down, depending on those signs."

<p>Prins is a senior fellow at the think tank Demos. She worked as a 
managing director for Goldman Sachs and is author of the book "How 
'Conservatives' are Picking Your Pocket (Whether You Voted for Them or Not)."

<p>STEVE KRETZMAN, <a href="mailto:steve@priceofoil.org">steve@priceofoil.org</a>, <a href="http://www.tompaine.com/articles/2006/10/20/separation_of_oil_and_state.php" target="_new">http://www.tompaine.com/articles/2006/10/20/separation_of_oil_and_state.php</a>
<p>Executive director of Oil Change International, Kretzman's most 
recent piece is "Separation Of Oil And State." He said today: "What 
we're seeing in the oil markets right now is a chilling demonstration 
of the mutual and constantly converging interests of oil and state in 
the U.S. In other words, it's not a conspiracy -- it's the gasoline 
market, which is an oligopoly, recognizing that its collective 
self-interest lies in more Republican rule.


<p>"In the current election cycle, the Center for Responsive 
Politics reports  that donations from the oil industry and its 
employees are running 83 percent in favor of Republicans, which is 
the most pronounced slant by the oil industry -- and possibly the 
most pronounced in any industry -- ever. Clearly, they know which 
side their bread is buttered on, and can take actions to protect 
those interests."
