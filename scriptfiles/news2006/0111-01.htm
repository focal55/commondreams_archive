<p>BOSTON - January 11 - As President Bush and his senior advisors traveled across the country this past weekend touting 2005 job growth numbers and demanding that Congress make the administration's tax cuts permanent, a study examines the administration's claim that tax cuts create jobs-and finds it without merit.

<p>While two million jobs were created in 2005, this is 3.5 million jobs short of expectations by the President's Council of Economic Advisors, who estimate job growth at 3.1% in a normal year.  Jobs grew by only 1.5% in 2005.

<p>"The president's tax-cutting policy is a failure in regard to job creation, and we need to recognize it as such, " said Anisha Desai, program director at UFE and one of the report's co-authors. "While there is no evidence that massive tax cuts create jobs, there is considerable evidence that they contribute to economy-choking deficits."

<p>The report reviewed administration claims that "tax cuts create jobs" and found the following:

<p>
<ul>
<li>Tax cuts have no predictable effect on employment, either in job creation or job destruction.</li>
<li>Since 2003, job creation has fallen millions of jobs short of the administration's promises.</li>
<li>The current weakness in job creation during an economic recovery is unprecedented since World War II.</li>
</ul>
<p>The report highlighted other concerns about jobs and the economy as well. For example, the number of good quality jobs (defined as those paying at least $16 an hour, providing employer-paid health insurance, and providing a
pension) has remained flat at 25% of all workers.  Significant racial disparities exist:  black employment is at 89.6%, compared to 95.2% for whites.  And Latino workers average more than $10,000 per year less in earnings than whites, and this gap is increasing.

<p>The report, entitled "Nothing to Be Thankful For:  Tax Cuts and the Deteriorating U.S. Job Market" was co-authored by Anisha Desai, Scott Klinger, Gloribell Mota, and Liz Stanton. The authors are available for interviews by calling 617-423-2148 ext. 119, or emailing ckasica@faireconomy.org.
