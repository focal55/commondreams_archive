<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON - September 13 - The American Civil Liberties Union today strongly rebuked the 
Senate Judiciary Committee for adopting legislation that approves warrantless 
spying on Americans by the National Security Agency. The move follows a recent 
court decision finding the surveillance both illegal and unconstitutional. The 
Bush administration has thus far stonewalled efforts by the committee to conduct 
meaningful oversight over the program.</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Today, the Senate Judiciary Committee acted as a rubber stamp for the 
administration&#8217;s abuse of power," said Caroline Fredrickson, Director of the 
ACLU Washington Legislative Office. "Congress has a right and obligation to 
conduct meaningful oversight on the unlawful actions of the president. But 
instead of investigating lawbreaking, the Senate Judiciary Committee wants to 
make it legal. We urge the full Senate to reject any attempts to ratify this 
illegal program."</font></P><P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">By a vote of 10 to 8, the committee approved S.2453, the "National Security 
Surveillance Act." That bill, crafted by Vice-President Dick Cheney and Chairman 
Arlen Specter (R-PA) gives the president the option of complying - or not - with 
the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act and the protections of the Fourth 
Amendment.</font></P><P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The bill would also: vastly increase the government&#8217;s statutory power to 
examine all international phone conversations and emails, making warrantless 
surveillance of Americans&#8217; conversations the rule rather then the exception and 
expand the ability to conduct warrantless physical searches of Americans&#8217; homes.</font></P><P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Senator Mike DeWine&#8217;s (R-OH) "Terrorist Surveillance Program Act of 2006" (S. 
2455) was approved by a vote of 10 to 8. This bill would weaken the probable 
cause requirement for spying on people in the US - sweeping in innocent 
Americans - allow extended warrantless surveillance, limit judicial review and 
punish whistleblowers.</font></P><P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Senator Dianne Feinstein&#8217;s (D-CA) "Foreign Intelligence Surveillance 
Improvement and Enhancement Act of 2006" (S. 3001), co-sponsored by Senator 
Specter, was also approved today in the only bipartisan vote taken by the 
Judiciary Committee, with the support of Senators Lindsey Graham (R-SC) and 
Specter, on a vote of 10 to 8. Her bill would restore the rule of law by 
requiring the president to follow the exclusive procedures set by Congress for 
wiretapping Americans and it would also streamline the procedures to seek a FISA 
warrant.</font></P><P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The ACLU has urged Congress to reject any legislation that would authorize 
the president&#8217;s continued warrantless surveillance of Americans, as the Specter 
and DeWine bills would do, and has noted that Congress has failed to thoroughly 
investigate the secret programs authorized by the president. Attorney General 
Alberto Gonzales has disclosed that President Bush personally interfered to stop 
an investigation by the Justice Department&#8217;s Office of Professional 
Responsibility into the NSA&#8217;s warrantless surveillance. Vice President Cheney 
also personally intervened to block telecommunications companies from giving any 
testimony to Congress about the extent of the warrantless surveillance of 
Americans they have assisted the administration in obtaining. And, recently, a 
federal court in Detroit found the program to be both illegal and 
unconstitutional. That case is stayed pending appeal.</font></P>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"The approval of partisan bills to ratify the illegal spying on Americans 
demonstrates cowardly obedience to the president, to the detriment of the 
liberty and privacy of the American people and the rule of law," said Lisa 
Graves, ACLU Senior Counsel for Legislative Strategy. "Stonewalling and illegal 
spying have been rewarded with the Senate Judiciary Committee&#8217;s partisan 
approval of administration misconduct. Only Senator Feinstein&#8217;s bipartisan bill 
would help restore the rule of law. We call on the Senate to stand up for the 
Constitution and reject the Big Brother bills as non-starters that give the 
administration a blank check."</font></P>
