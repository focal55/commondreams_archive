<p>WASHINGTON - April 12 - The senseless  slaughter of 230,000 seal pups began this morning off the coast of  Newfoundland. The International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW) is  flying overhead, monitoring and documenting this event so the world  can see the shameful reality.</p>
<p>   The Department of Fisheries and Oceans has already demonstrated  their inability to manage this hunt this year, with the Gulf of St.  Lawrence component going almost 20 percent over the quota set by the  Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO). There is no penalty for  going over the quota and DFO is not adjusting today's hunt quota to  reflect the overrun.</p>
<p>   &quot;This cruel and unnecessary hunt is a mismanaged mess,&quot; said  Olivier Bonnet, IFAW's Canadian director.</p>
<p>   &quot;DFO is utterly incapable of effectively regulating and managing  this slaughter. Repeatedly sealers take more than the quota and DFO  lets it happen. Combined with the extreme cruelty we witness every  year and raging negative publicity for Canada, the time has come to  finally end the seal hunt and move on.&quot;</p>
<p>   Canada's commercial seal hunt has two phases –- the Gulf hunt and  the Front hunt. For 2006, the Gulf hunt quota was 92,343 seals. DFO  announced yesterday that sealers have so far killed 108,653 seals -- 16,310 seals over the quota.</p>
<p>   The quota for the Front hunt is 232,657 seals. Most of this hunt  begins by being open for one day, and then DFO assesses whether it  will re-open. The Front hunt is an extremely competitive, reckless  environment that is known to be extremely difficult to regulate and  monitor by authorities.</p>
<p>   &quot;We are very worried about the level of cruelty that we are going  to see today,&quot; said Regina Flores, IFAW's seals campaigner. &quot;As  IFAW, our role is to show the world that this is happening and  encourage everyone to pressure the Canadian government to end it  once and for all.&quot;</p>
