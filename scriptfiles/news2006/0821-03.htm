<p>WASHINGTON - August 21 - Calling President Bush&#8217;s &#8220;hard line&#8221; policies 
              on Iraq and Iran failures that have undermined national security 
              and made America less safe, General Joseph Hoar (USMC ret.), Lt. 
              General Robert Gard (USA ret.), and Morton Halperin, former National 
              Security Council staff, released an open letter signed by twenty-one 
              colleagues urging the Administration to reverse course (full text, 
list of signers &amp; bios of three speakers below). 
<p>In a telephone press conference today, Lt. General Gard said, &#8220;We 
              who have served this country cannot stand by silently while the 
              President and his spokespeople attack critics of their deeply flawed 
              policies as &#8216;soft on terrorism&#8217;. The Administration 
              has repeatedly failed to seek diplomatic solutions to problems that 
              are only inflamed by the use of military force. They need to start 
              talking with the Iranians immediately,&#8221; he continued. </p>
            <p>&#8220;We believe that the U.S. occupation of Iraq continues to 
              divert our nation's resources from addressing adequately the most 
              serious threat to our national security, Al Qaeda.&#8221; he added.</p>
            <p>&#8220;We also believe that the President's failure to engage immediately 
              and without preconditions in direct talks with the government of 
              Iran, and the Administration's continued consideration of military 
              action against that country, could lead to disastrous consequences 
              for security in the region and for U.S. forces in Iraq,&#8221; he 
              concluded.</p>
            <p><strong>The statement signed by former U.S. military, national 
              security and foreign policy officials calls for immediate direct 
              talks with the government of Iran, without preconditions, and cautions 
              against the use of military action to resolve the current crises 
              in the Middle East or to settle differences over Iran&#8217;s nuclear 
              program. </strong> </p>
            <p><strong>Full text:</strong></p>
            <p><em>As former military leaders and foreign policy officials, we 
              call on the Bush Administration to engage immediately in direct 
              talks with the government of Iran without preconditions to help 
              resolve the current crisis in the Middle East and settle differences 
              over the Iranian nuclear program.</em></p>
            <p><em>We strongly caution against any consideration of the use of 
              military force against Iran. The current crises must be resolved 
              through diplomacy, not military action. An attack on Iran would 
              have disastrous consequences for security in the region and U.S. 
              forces in Iraq, and it would inflame hatred and violence in the 
              Middle East and among Muslims everywhere.</em></p>
            <p><em>A strategy of diplomatic engagement with Iran will serve the 
              interests of the U.S. and its allies, and would enhance regional 
              and international security.</em></p>
