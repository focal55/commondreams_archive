<p>WASHINGTON - March 24 - 
<p><b><a href="mailto:secrecyprivilege@aol.com">ROBERT PARRY</a></b><br />
In early 2005, Parry wrote the article "Bush's 'Death Squads,'" which examined the "Salvador Option" in Iraq, referring to the 1980s U.S. government's "supporting El Salvador's right-wing security forces, which operated clandestine 'death squads' to eliminate both leftist guerrillas and their civilian sympathizers."<br />
<br />
Parry is editor of ConsortiumNews.com. He broke many of the Iran-Contra stories in the 1980s for the Associated Press and Newsweek. His latest book is <i>Secrecy & Privilege: Rise of the Bush Dynasty from Watergate to Iraq</i>.<br />

<b><a href="mailto:browniess@yahoo.com">ARUN GUPTA</a></b><br />
Gupta has been among the first reporters to write about death squads in Iraq and examine their links to the Interior Ministry. He is an editor with <i>The Indypendent</i>. Gupta said today: "The proliferation of militias in the security forces is tacit U.S. policy. Eager to 'stand up' Iraqi forces, the Bush administration has allowed the police to take over huge swaths of Baghdad and other cities despite knowing that they were more loyal to their warlords than [to] the Iraqi government."<br />

<b><a href="mailto:direland@nyc.rr.com">DOUG IRELAND</a></b><br />
Ireland wrote the piece "Shia Death Squads Target Iraqi Gays," in the current issue of the <i>Gay City News</i>. Ireland wrote: "Following a death-to-gays fatwa issued last October by Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, death squads of the Badr Corps have been systematically targeting gay Iraqis for persecution and execution, gay Iraqis say. But when they ask for help and protection from U.S. occupying authorities in the 'Green Zone,' gay Iraqis are met with indifference and derision."<br />
