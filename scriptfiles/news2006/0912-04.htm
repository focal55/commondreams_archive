<p>NEW YORK - September 12 - Rainforest Action Network (RAN) celebrated in style Saturday night with a star-studded fete at The Plumm Nightclub in New York City. A surprise musical performance by Grammy-winning singer-songwriter Norah Jones delighted the crowd, which included hosts Chris Noth (Sex & the City, Law & Order: Criminal Intent) and longtime actor-activist Whoopi Goldberg. Nellie McKay also performed, while celebrities like Sharon Angela (The Sopranos), Christopher Maloney (Law and Order: SVU, Oz), Sherri Saum (Rescue Me), Dana Delaney (Kidnapped), and Jesse Martin (Law & Order) sipped on Rainforest Revolution cocktails and nibbled on organic hors d’oeuvres.
</p>
<p>“On behalf of Rainforest Action Network and all those who are passionate about protecting the environment and human rights, I want to thank everyone who made this evening possible,” said RAN Executive Director Michael Brune. “In particular, we owe Chris Noth a tremendous debt of gratitude. Without his generosity, RAN’s New York celebration would never have been such a smashing success.”
</p>
<p>RAN works to protect the Earth’s forests and support the rights of their inhabitants through education, grassroots organizing and non-violent direct action. RAN accomplishes its mission through dynamic, hard-hitting campaigns that strive to bring corporate and governmental policies into alignment with popular support for conservation. RAN works in alliance with environmental and human rights groups around the world, including indigenous communities and non-governmental organizations.
</p>
<p>RAN’s Global Finance Campaign works to redirect the global economic system away from environmentally and socially destructive activities and into clean, sustainable, and socially just alternatives. The organization’s Old Growth Campaign is fighting to protect endangered forests, promote sustainable economies and protect indigenous rights, while the Jumpstart Ford Campaign is working to end America’s oil addiction.
</p>
<p>“RAN’s success over the years in bringing corporate America to its senses has been made possible by our terrific, hard-working supporters,” said Brune. “The unceasing assault on our environment and on indigenous rights around the world makes RAN’s work more important than ever before. Hopefully, this is the first of many future New York celebrations, because the generosity and commitment we’ve seen tonight will help us win our campaigns and make the world a better place.”
