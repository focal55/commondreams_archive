<p>RESTON, Virginia - September 8 - On Sept. 8-12, more than 100 medical students representing states across the nation will congregate in Washington, D.C. for the Paul Ambrose Legislative Affairs Leadership Institute, a weekend aimed at providing physicians-in-training the opportunity to learn practical political skills to help effect change.     <P>
Presented by the American Medical Student Association (AMSA), the Legislative Affairs Leadership Institute will feature keynote addresses from such high-profile voices as Rear Admiral Moritsugu, Acting Surgeon General; R. James Nicholson, Secretary of Veterans Affairs; Dr. Gloria Wilder-Braitewaite, nationally renowned anti-poverty physician activist; and Major Sudip Bose, highly decorated Army physician.    <P>
Over the course of the five-day program, the medical students will experience Washington, D.C. politics firsthand, engaging in activities ranging from joining a rally outside the White House to protesting the Genocide in Darfur to holding a silent Candlelight Vigil for Veteran's Health in front of the Vice President's residence.     <P>
The Institute will conclude with a Lobby Day on Capital Hill during which the students will meet with Senator Barak Obama (D- Ill.) before lobbying on his bill, The Healthy Places Act (S.2772). AMSA endorses the Healthy Places Act as an innovative legislative solution for reducing our nation's burden of chronic disease and obesity.     <P>
The 2006 Legislative Affairs Leadership Institute is the largest health policy training institute ever convened by AMSA. Over the course of the weekend, students will develop strategies on how to effectively carry out legislative action and grassroots campaigning at their respective medical schools and in their communities. A particular focus of the institute will be training medical students to return to their medical schools and actively participate in advocating for the needs of veterans, refugees, uninsured persons and underserved minority communities during the upcoming election season.     <P>
"The medical student voice is particularly important during this critical election year, as we have a responsibility to both our patients and our profession to speak up for the health care needs of this nation," says AMSA's legislative affairs director, Catherine Davenport Pollock. "This institute's combination of powerful bipartisan speakers and legislative skills development training will give the next generation of physicians the tools to really procure political change."     <P>
The Legislative Affairs Leadership Institute is named in memory of Paul Ambrose, a former AMSA legislative affairs director who was lost in the September 11, 2001 tragedy.     <P>
"It's entirely fitting that we conduct this breakthrough conference in memory of Dr. Ambrose, a tireless advocate for the underserved and an outstanding physician," says AMSA President Jay Bhatt. "Ambrose inspired thousands of medical students to pursue careers in public service during his 1995-96 term representing AMSA on Capital Hill."    <P>
For more information about the Institute, please contact the office of AMSA's legislative affairs director, Catherine Davenport Pollock, at 703-620-6600 ext. 211 or lad@amsa.org.    <!-- #EndEditable -->
