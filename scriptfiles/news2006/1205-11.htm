<p>WASHINGTON - December 5 - Military Families Speak Out (MFSO), a nonpartisan organization of over 3,100 military families who are opposed to the war in Iraq, is concerned that the conclusions of the Baker-Hamilton Iraq Study Group report due out on Wednesday, December 6th will be used to continue the war in Iraq, rather than bring it to an end, and bring U.S. troops home quickly and safely from a war that should never have happened. Early accounts of the report’s recommendations suggest that President Bush will be offered broad flexibility in determining the timetable for pulling back U.S. combat troops in Iraq. These accounts also indicate that the report envisions leaving significant numbers of U.S. troops in Iraq for years to come. 

<p>“It appears that the purpose of the Iraq Study Group report has been to provide political cover to politicians as they prepare for the 2008 elections,” said Nancy Lessin, a co-founder of Military Families Speak Out. “It seems that the report will allow the administration and Congress to avoid dealing with the real problem in Iraq, the U.S. military occupation.” 

<p>“As the violence in Iraq continues and escalates, with an average of two or more U.S. troops and countless Iraqis being killed each day, it is past time for political gamesmanship,” said Charley Richardson, another Military Families Speak Out co-founder. “Military Families Speak Out renews our call for an end to the U.S. military occupation of Iraq and for bringing our troops home now.” 

<p>To arrange interviews with members of Military Families Speak Out to comment on the Iraq Study Group report, contact Ateqah Khaki, Riptide Communications, at 212-260-5000 or Nancy Lessin, Military Families Speak Out, at 617-320-5301.
