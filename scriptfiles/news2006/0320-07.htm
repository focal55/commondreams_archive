<p>NEW YORK  - March 20 - On the third anniversary of the 

US invasion of Iraq, MADRE, an international women's human rights 

organization, reiterates our call for the deployment of a United 

Nations-led peacekeeping force and an immediate end to the US 

occupation.  As the crisis in Iraq intensifies, women and their 

families in Iraq face an urgent need for security, functional 

government, and the provision of basic services within a human rights 

framework.</p>  

<p>Read MADRE's statement, <a

Demands UN Response: MADRE Calls for International Peacekeepers</a></p>

<p><b>Available for interviews on MADRE's statement and women's human 

rights in Iraq:</b></p>

<p><b>Yifat Susskind</b>, MADRE's Communications Director, was born and 

raised in Israel and was active in the Israeli women's peace movement 

for several years before joining MADRE in 1997. Her critical analysis 

of US foreign policy and women's human rights in the Middle East and 

other parts of the world has appeared in online and print publications 

such as <a 

href="http://www.tompaine.com/articles/2005/08/18/iraqs_secondclass_cit

izens.php?tr=y&auid=1470618">TomPaine.com</a>, <a 

href="http://www.fpif.org/fpiftxt/586?tr=y&auid=1470620">Foreign Policy 

in Focus</a>, and <i>The W Effect: Bush's War on Women</i>, published 

by the Feminist Press in 2004.  Ms. Susskind has also been featured as 

a commentator on CNN, National Public Radio, and BBC Radio.  She is the 

author of a book on US foreign policy and women's human rights and a 

report on violence against women in Iraq, both forthcoming.</p> 

<p><b>Houzan Mahmoud</b> is the UK representative of MADRE's sister 

organization, the Organization of Women's Freedom in Iraq (OWFI), and 

Editor in Chief of Equal Rights Now!, a publication of OWFI.  Ms. 

Mahmoud speaks internationally on behalf of OWFI about the impact of 

the US occupation and the rise in Islamic fundamentalism on women's 

human rights and women's daily lives. As of late, she has focused in 

particular on the escalation of sectarian violence, Iraq's fraudulent 

political process, and the role of Iraq's progressive, secular movement 

in articulating human rights-based alternatives for Iraq's future.  Her 

analysis has been published by <a 

href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0,3604,1164268,00.html">The Guardian</a> and <a 

href="http://comment.independent.co.uk/commentators/article305879.ece">

The Independent</a>, and she has been a featured commentator on BBC, 

CNN, and other international media outlets. Ms. Mahmoud is based in 

London and will be in New York for speaking engagements during the 

anniversary of the US invasion of Iraq.</p>
