<p>WASHINGTON - July 25 -

    On July 23, the United Nations Emergency Relief coordinator, Jan 
Egeland, visited Beirut. The BBC reported: "[Egeland] said the 
'disproportionate response' by Israel was a 'violation of international 
humanitarian law.'" <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/5207478.stm" target="_new">http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/5207478.stm</a>.

<p>The United Nations' top human rights official, Louise Arbour, <a href="http://www.unhchr.ch/huricane/huricane.nsf/view01/5AF0033D13E85EFEC12571B00061BFDE?opendocument" target="_new">warned 
on July 19</a>: "International law demands accountability. The scale of the 
killings in the region, and their predictability, could engage the 
personal criminal responsibility of those involved, particularly those 
in a position of command and control." 
<p><a href="mailto:fboyle@law.uiuc.edu"><b>FRANCIS BOYLE</b></a> <br>

    Professor of international law at the University of Illinois, Boyle 
said today: &quot;Although Lebanon is not a party to the Statute of the 
International Criminal Court, nevertheless Lebanon can and should file a 
declaration ... [and] ask the ICC prosecutor to initiate an 
investigation into war crimes and crimes against humanity committed by 
Israel in Lebanon.&quot; Boyle is author of the books &quot;Biowarfare and 
Terrorism&quot; and &quot;Destroying World Order.&quot;<br>
<p><a href="mailto:president@adc.org"><b>MARY ROSE OKAR</b></a>, <a href="http://www.adc.org" target="_new">http://www.adc.org</a><br>

Okar is president of the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination 
Committee, which today filed a federal lawsuit claiming that Secretary 
of State Condoleezza Rice and Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld 
failed to fulfill their constitutional and professional obligations and 
protect U.S. citizens in a crisis or time of war.
<p>Okar, who is a former member of Congress, said today: "At no time 
has President Bush, Secretary of State Rice, or Secretary of Defense 
Rumsfeld called for a ceasefire in Lebanon. To the contrary, the Bush 
administration has encouraged the violence by sending an urgent shipment 
of bombs to Israel giving that country the green light to continue in 
its indiscriminant bombing of Lebanon. This has placed innocent 
civilians, including thousands of U.S. citizens, in harm's way and has 
resulted in injuring several U.S. citizens in Lebanon."

    Berrigan is senior research associate at the Arms Trade Resource 
Center, which recently released the report "U.S. Military Assistance and 
Arms Transfers to Israel: U.S. Aid, Companies Fuel Israeli Military."

<p>She said today: "For more than 30 years, Israel had been the largest 
recipient of U.S. foreign assistance and since 1985 it has received 
about $3 billion in military and economic aid each year from Washington. 
In addition, Israel is one of the United States' largest arms importers. 
The bulk of Israel's current arsenal is composed of equipment supplied 
under U.S. military aid programs.
<p>"The Arms Export Control Act, enacted in 1976, stipulates that 
weapons may be transferred for self-defense, internal security and UN 
operations only and establishes a process for Congressional advance 
notice of major sales."

    Fred Abrahams is senior emergencies researcher for Human Rights 
Watch actions in Gaza, Israel and Lebanon. He said today: "Human Rights 
Watch has serious concerns about Israel and Hezbollah's compliance with 
international humanitarian law (the laws of war) during military actions 
in Gaza, Israel and Lebanon. Two fundamental tenets of international 
humanitarian law are those of 'civilian immunity' and the principle of 
'distinction.' They impose a duty on all sides in a conflict to 
distinguish between combatants and civilians, and to target only the 
former. Serious violations of international humanitarian law are war 
crimes."
