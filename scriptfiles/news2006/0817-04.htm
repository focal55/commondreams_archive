<p>YARMOUTH PORT, Massachusetts - August 17 - IFAW (The  International Fund for Animal Welfare -- <a href="http://releases.usnewswire.com/redir.asp?ReleaseID=70877&Link=http://www.ifaw.org">http://www.ifaw.org</a> ) has  officially launched the Animal Rescue Blog at  <a href="http://releases.usnewswire.com/redir.asp?ReleaseID=70877&Link=http://www.animalrescueblog.org">http://www.animalrescueblog.org</a> -- the first blog on the Internet  to focus solely on worldwide emergency relief efforts to save  animals from manmade and natural disasters.</p>
<p>   The Animal Rescue Blog ( <a href="http://releases.usnewswire.com/redir.asp?ReleaseID=70877&Link=http://www.animalrescueblog.org">http://www.animalrescueblog.org</a> )  will bring readers into the trenches of on-the-ground animal  rescue efforts in disaster-affected areas such as Lebanon and  Israel, Indonesia and India. The Animal Rescue Blog will provide  a single platform for the latest animal relief news, commentary  and photos/videos from animal rescue efforts around the globe.</p>
<p>   &quot;We are connecting a virtual community of people interested in  and committed to animal rescue work by using this highly  interactive space to post regular updates from the field,&quot; said  Cassandra Koenen, IFAW's director of online campaigns and  marketing.</p>
<p>   The blog provides a &quot;pet's eye view&quot; of IFAW's work and takes  advantage of the Web 2.0 features to create a living web.  Visitors can add their individual comments or use del.icio.us or  digg to further amplify IFAW's web presence. The blog will also  take advantage of the technology offered by YouTube.com and  Flickr to further enhance the experience for visitors with video  and photographs submitted directly from rescue locations.</p>
<p>   When families evacuating from Hurricane Katrina had to leave  their pets behind or when families fleeing the war in the Middle  East were forced to abandon their family pets, IFAW staff and  sponsored volunteers risked their own lives to ensure that these  animals would be fed and cared for in the absence of their  owners. The Animal Rescue Blog tells these and other compelling  stories.</p>
<p>   IFAW is working everyday around the world to rescue animals in  harm's way and to provide shelter and care for orphaned, injured,  or mistreated animals, including stranded sea mammals and birds  affected by oil spills. This new communication tool will educate  the public about the importance of animal rescue work and inspire  more people to get involved. While this blog will publish sad and  tragic stories, it will also share the happy and triumphant ones  that make IFAW's animal rescue work worthwhile.</p>
