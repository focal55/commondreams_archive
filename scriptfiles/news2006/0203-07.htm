<p>WASHINGTON - February 3 - <p>   Tomorrow Feb. 4: Massive March to the White House; A New  Movement With a Single Demand: Bush Step Down</p>
<p>   WHO: </p>
<p>   -- Kathleen Chalfant, Broadway and TV actress </p>
<p>   -- Ann Wright, former U.S. diplomat and military officer quit  in protest of war</p>
<p>   -- Martin Garbus, trial lawyer and author </p>
<p>   -- Doris &quot;Granny D&quot; Haddock, walked across the country for  campaign finance reform</p>
<p>   -- Michael Ratner, Center for Constitutional Rights</p>
<p>   -- Boots Riley, The Coup (Hip-Hop artist)</p>
<p>   -- Rev. Al Sharpton, long time activist</p>
<p>   -- Thousands of People: taking to the streets and circling the  White House</p>
<p>  WHAT: </p>
<p>   11 a.m. rally, 2 p.m. march to White House: 30 foot statue of  Bush will be toppled.</p>
<p>   WHEN: </p>
<p>   Saturday Feb. 4: 11 a.m. rally, 2 p.m. march </p>
<p>   WHERE: </p>
<p>   17th and Constitution, then march to the White House</p>
<p>   DETAILS:</p>
<p>   On Saturday, Feb. 4, tens of thousands will travel from across  the country to the national seat of government with a single  demand: Bush Step Down And Take Your Program with You.  The crowd  will rally beginning at 11am, then encircle the White House at  2 p.m.</p>
<p>   World Can't Wait is quickly attracting a surprising and broad  range of well-known people in public life including U.S.  Congressional Representatives JOHN CONYERS, CYNTHIA MCKINNEY,  MAXINE WATERS, BOBBIE RUSH, and MAJOR OWENS, along with HARRY  BELAFONTE, LEWIS LAPHAM, MARK RUFFALO, SEAN PENN, SUSAN SARANDON,  GLORIA STEINEM, SERJ TANKIAN, CORNEL WEST, HAROLD PINTER, and  PAUL HAGGIS. Two full-page ads have appeared in the New York  Times and spots are running nationally on Air America radio. </p>
<p>   Debra Sweet, national coordinator of World Can't Wait-Drive  Out the Bush Regime, states, &quot;Torture, war, the  rule of law and separation of church state eviscerated, an  extreme rightwing Supreme Court nominee goes essentially  unopposed... The hour is late. This whole regime is illegitimate  and criminal, and politics as usual have failed to stop  it.  Bush will not be indicted, impeached, or driven from office  without massive, determined, unrelenting protest with  the concrete demand that BUSH STEP DOWN. This is what we set out  to do.&quot;</p>
<p>   On the night of the State of the Union address, at exactly  9 p.m. as Bush stepped to the podium, there were World  Can't Wait rallies to &quot;drown-out Bush's lies&quot; in over 60 U.S.  cities, including Greensboro, N.C., where 7 protesters  were arrested, and in Iraq where several U.S. soldiers shot  rounds of artillery into the air at 9 p.m. EST to drown out  Bush.</p>
