<p>WASHINGTON - July 19 - 
<p><b>WHAT:</b> DC Vote will host a press conference to launch a compelling public awareness campaign designed to educate Americans about DC's unique relationship with Congress. The campaign will be launched with print ads in Metro stops and bus shelters across the District of Columbia, and it will grow to include nationwide television and radio messaging. The print ad to be unveiled is the first in a series running through April 2007. 

<p><b>WHEN:</b> Thursday, July 20, 10 a.m. 

<p><b>WHERE:</b> Bus Shelter, Intersection of 10th Street and Independence Avenue SW, Washington, D.C.

<p><b>WHO:</b> 

<blockquote>-- Jack Evans, DC Council chair pro tempore

<p>-- Kwame Brown, DC Councilmember (at-large)

<p>-- Ilir Zherka, executive director, DC Vote
</blockquote>
<p><b>WHY:</b> DC Vote was awarded $500,000 in competitive grant funding by Mayor Anthony Williams and the DC City Council to promote educational and informational activities to apprise the public about the lack of congressional voting representation for the nearly 600,000 residents of the District of Columbia. Recent public opinion research conducted for DC Vote by the renowned Mellman Group was used to help craft messaging for the new campaign.
