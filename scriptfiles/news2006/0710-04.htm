<p>WASHINGTON - July 10 - Barbara R. Arnwine,  executive director of the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights  Under Law, will testify today in Geneva before the United Nations  Human Rights Committee concerning the International Covenant on  Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR).  </p>
<p>   As part of her testimony, Arnwine will urge the Human Rights  Committee to call for an immediate termination of the U.S.  government's efforts to continue to restrict minority person's  inalienable right to vote through photo identification  requirements and other hostile legislative actions.</p>
<p>   In addition, Arnwine will urge the Human Rights Committee to  reiterate its past observations and call for a probing  examination by the U.S. government of its policies to protect the  civil and political rights of its most vulnerable communities. </p>
<p>   As part of her testimony, Arnwine will submit a report titled,  &quot;A Critical Assessment of the U.S. Commitment to Civil and  Political Rights: Toward Securing Equality and Justice for All.&quot;  The report provides insight into denials of civil rights in the  U.S. and describes how such civil rights violations have affected  different communities in the U.S. The Report also offers  recommendations for actions to strengthen the government's  current strategy for fulfilling its obligations under the ICCPR.</p>
<p>   Arnwine is participating in the Human Rights Committee's 87th  Session in Geneva. Reports submitted by the Governments of the  United States, the Central African Republic, as well as the  United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo on  measures taken to implement the ICCPR will be reviewed by the  Human Rights Committee.  </p>

White &amp; Case LLP provided pro  bono assistance in the coordination and drafting of this report. </p>

<p>   The Lawyers' Committee is a nonpartisan, nonprofit civil  rights legal organization, formed in 1963 at the request of  President John F. Kennedy to provide legal services to address  racial discrimination.
