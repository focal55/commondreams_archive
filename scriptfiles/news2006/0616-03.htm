<p>FRIGATE BAY, St. Kitts - June 16 - Representatives from 66 nations are convening today in the  Caribbean nation of St. Kitts and Nevis for the 58th meeting of  the IWC to debate whether a 1986 global moratorium on whaling  should be lifted, allowing whales to be hunted commercially.  A  global community that fought hard to &quot;Save the Whales&quot; in the  1970s is holding its breath as a Japanese-led pro-whaling voting  block attempts to wrangle control of the International Whaling  Commission (IWC) for the first time.</p>
<p>   Tension will be particularly high, as Japan may have amassed  enough pro-whale votes within the IWC to control the simple  majority, though narrowly, through what it calls its &quot;vote  consolidation&quot; program. This would give Japan the power to  reverse many of the IWC's whale conservation initiatives and to  replace them with those that support whaling, putting the world's  whales in the greatest jeopardy they have faced since 1986 when  the IWC whaling moratorium was put in place.</p>
<p>   &quot;It is very likely that Japan may have finally realized their  long-held goal to establish a pro-whaling majority within the  IWC,&quot; said International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW) Director  of Wildlife and Habitat Protection Dr. Joth Singh. &quot;This would be  a tragedy for the whales and for the decades of critical  conservation efforts that have gone into protecting them.&quot;</p>
<p>   Though commercial whaling has not been allowed since the 1986  moratorium went into place, Japan, Norway and Iceland continue to  hunt whales. Japan and Iceland do so in the name of &quot;science,&quot;  citing an IWC resolution that allows for lethal whale research.  This year, Japan has announced it will hunt more than 1,200  whales as part of what it calls its &quot;scientific&quot; whaling program.  Japan sells the whale meat commercially, which it says is allowed  as part of the IWC's lethal whale research rules, though the IWC  has officially criticized these whaling activities.</p>
<p>   IFAW is calling on IWC members to take a strong stand against  commercial whaling at this year's IWC meeting.
