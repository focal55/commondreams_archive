<p>WASHINGTON - October 30 - Rock the Vote announced today a new campaign encouraging young people to make short video statements about why they plan to vote and to post them at the Rock the Vote page on AOL's new user-generated video site, AOL UnCut Video (<a href="http://www.uncutvideo.aol.com">http://www.uncutvideo.aol.com</a>.)
 
<p>The campaign, which launches today and will be an ongoing feature at Rock the Vote's website (<a href="http://www.rockthevote.com">http://www.rockthevote.com</a>), issues a challenge to the generation:  "Ten seconds to two minutes – tell the world what makes you want to Rock the Vote.  Iraq?  Student debt?  Global warming?  Grab your webcam, camcorder, digital camera, or cell phone, shoot your statement, and upload it.  Let's make our voices heard." 
 
<p>With AOL UnCut Video, users can make videos with almost any device—webcams, camcorders, digital cameras and cell phones—and upload the video directly to a Rock the Vote branded page in UnCut Video.   
 
<p>While Rock the Vote is well known for working with entertainment industry leaders to create public service announcements that engage younger generations in politics, the UnCut Video approach is completely different.  It asks young people to make clips of themselves, ten seconds to two minutes in length, as simple a production as making a statement into a camera.  In addition to posting their own videos, visitors to UnCut Video can browse a collection of Rock the Vote video statements that others have submitted. 
 
<p>Hans Riemer, Political Director of Rock the Vote, said, "We want a video archive of what is most on the mind of the new generation when it comes to voting in 2006.  Our new campaign offers a great platform for young Americans to tell us, and the world, what makes them want to Rock the Vote." 
 
<p>Riemer continued, "The value is in the statement, not the production—we're looking for voters, not directors."
 
<p>Bill Schreiner, Vice President, AOL UnCut Video added, "UnCut Video allows anyone to shoot, upload and share their video statements quickly and easily from a file or directly from an array of personal video devices, making UnCut a perfect online partner for this campaign.  What's more, AOL's wide reach means that these statements will be seen by an enormous online audience, adding to the campaign's impact."
