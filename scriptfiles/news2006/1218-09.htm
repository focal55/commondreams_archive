<p>WASHINGTON - December 18 - Esther Nieves, national director of the American Friends Service Committee Project Voice immigrant rights program, observes: “Anti-immigrant laws that limit access to jobs and housing and that build fences and walls are inhumane, knee-jerk responses that offer no real solutions to problems of migration. In the United States, the real solution is logical, just and humane immigration policy.”
<p><em>Philadelphia </em>(December 15) &nbsp;&mdash; As <em>International Migrants&rsquo; Day </em>approaches, the contributions of the world&rsquo;s estimated 185 million migrants and the challenges United States&rsquo; immigrants face are the focus of a series of nationwide events sponsored by the American Friends Service Committee (AFSC) and a host of immigrants rights organizations.</p>
<p>Immigrant and non-immigrant communities throughout the world will participate in activities urging their governments to honor the inherent and basic human rights of immigrants and refugees. The events will also focus on the <em>International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families </em>adopted in 1990 by the United Nations General Assembly. As of December 2006, 34 member states have ratified the Convention; the United States has not.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>In the United States, AFSC activities draw attention to the stalled immigration reform process, the escalation of anti-immigrant laws, increasingly punitive civil and human rights abuses and violations (including housing and employment restrictions), and the increased militarization of the nation&rsquo;s&nbsp; southern border.&nbsp;&nbsp; Despite these difficult conditions, the celebratory nature of the activities pays tribute to the spirit of unity and unwavering resilience of migrant communities.</p>
<p>The United Nations created <em>International Migrants&rsquo; Day</em> to affirm an unflagging commitment to human rights. This year, <em>International Migrants&rsquo; Day</em> falls on December 18. Immigrants throughout the world increasingly face multiple forms of violence and isolation.&nbsp; Because of this, it is important for the world community to reject laws, procedures or actions that diminish our common humanity, and to ensure that nations respect the human rights of every person.</p>
