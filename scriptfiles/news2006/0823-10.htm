<p>NEW ORLEANS  - August 23 - Several New Orleans ACORN members are featured in Spike Lee’s four-hour documentary, titled, “When the Levees Broke: A Requiem in Four Acts,’’ showing on HBO Aug. 21, 22 and 29.
</p>
<p>Tanya Harris, her mother Cherrie Harris and grandmother Josephine Butler share their personal stories in the four-hour, two-part film. Tanya, an ACORN community organizer in the Lower 9th Ward, one of the city’s most devastated neighborhoods, has been working since September to assist residents in returning and rebuilding. 
</p>
<p>“Everyone I’ve talked to want to come back,’’ Tanya stresses in the documentary. “They just need a little help.’’
</p>
<p>Since days after the storm, ACORN has been on the ground level working for residents’ rights to return. The national grassroots community organization has worked to secure additional funding and assistance for hurricane victims and has won lawsuits blocking the city from bulldozing properties without contacting homeowners.
</p>
<p>Tanya, a fourth-generation New Orleanian whose family lived in the Lower 9th Ward, joined other ACORN members Aug. 16 for the documentary’s premiere at the New Orleans Arena. The show aired Monday and Tuesday, in two parts, and will be shown in its entirety Aug. 29, the one-year anniversary of Katrina’s landfall.
