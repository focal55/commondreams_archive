<p>PHILADELPHIA - July 6 - Farm Aid co-founder Neil Young today announced that the nation's leading family farm advocacy organization will bring its annual benefit concert to The Tweeter Center on the Waterfront in Camden, N.J.

<p>Farm Aid 2006 will urge Americans to choose food from family farms, creating growing opportunities for more family farmers. Artists at the 2006 concert will show support for activities that keep family farmers on the land. Farm Aid's fundraising concert is scheduled to take place on Saturday, Sept. 30 and will feature headliners Willie Nelson, Neil Young, John Mellencamp and Dave Matthews, plus other top artists to be announced later.

<p>"Family farmers are our best choice for good, fresh, wholesome foods," said Farm Aid Board Member Neil Young. "When you choose local, sustainable, humanely raised, or organic food from family farms, you are keeping family farmers on the land."

<p>The Delaware River Valley is an area rooted in family farm agriculture. Almost half of the land in Pennsylvania and New Jersey is used for agriculture, and the region boasts more than 200 farmers' markets. Philadelphia is a city known for the strong support it shows regional family farms, and for its commitment to sustainability. At the same time, many of the region's residents live below the poverty line and are at risk for hunger and malnutrition.

<p>"Everyone, everywhere deserves access to family farm food," said Farm Aid President Willie Nelson. "The Farm Aid concert brings us all together to support one of our most important national resources, our family farmers."

<p>"Farm Aid is working hard to help all people find ways to buy fresh, family farm foods and to increase opportunities for family farmers," said Farm Aid Executive Director Carolyn Mugar. "Thankfully the Good Food Movement that Farm Aid has promoted and supported since 1985 is taking hold in grocery stores, farm-to- school programs, restaurants and at dinner tables across America."

<p>Since its beginning, Farm Aid has traveled the country, supporting local organizations working to strengthen and promote family farms. From Washington State to Washington, D.C., Farm Aid has helped family farmers create a movement that increases the supply and demand for family farm-identified food. Farm Aid's vision is for family farmers to provide us with good products -- food, fiber and alternative fuels that protect our land, our health and our environment.

<p>Willie Nelson, Neil Young and John Mellencamp organized the first Farm Aid concert in 1985 to raise awareness about the loss of family farms and to raise funds to keep farm families on their land. Dave Matthews joined the Farm Aid Board of Directors in 2001. Farm Aid has raised awareness about the critical role of family farms and raised more than $29 million to build and strengthen family farm food production. Between 1985 and 2005, 80 percent of Farm Aid's total expenditures were on effective programs for family farmers and their organizations. Through public education, program activities, and direct grants, Farm Aid promotes sustainable agriculture, fights factory farms, advocates for fair farm prices and provides disaster assistance and credit counseling to farm families.
