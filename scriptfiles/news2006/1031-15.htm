<p>WASHINGTON - October 31 - 
<p>SPENCER OVERTON, soverton@law.gwu.edu, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/30/opinion/30waldman.html">http://docs.law.gwu.edu/facweb/soverton</a> A law professor at George Washington University, Overton was a 
commissioner on the Carter-Baker Commission on Federal Election Reform. 
Author of the new book "Stealing Democracy: The New Politics of Voter 
Suppression," Overton said today: "In the 2006 elections, mass confusion 
is the biggest threat to the right to vote. Much disenfranchisement will 
be de facto -- rather than legal -- disenfranchisement. Politicians have 
created a maze of 4600 different election systems -- all with different 
rules and practices -- and the confusion over the rules itself threatens 
to chill voter participation. Some Americans may be discouraged from 
voting because they mistakenly assume that they need a photo ID or that 
the lines will be 4 hours long. People who have had a brush with the law 
may stay home, even though in most states ex-felons can vote.
  <p>  "Often, state election boards contribute to the confusion and 
misinformation. In Georgia, even after the court struck down the photo 
ID requirement, the state election board mailed out hundreds of 
thousands of letters indicating that voters needed photo ID to vote. The 
Florida election board's website suggests that a photo ID is required to 
cast a vote, but doesn't indicate that voters who don't have a photo ID 
can cast a ballot. Confused voters and election workers without adequate 
training may be intimidated by new electronic voting machines. I want to 
encourage people to go to the polls and vote. Voters should not 
disenfranchise themselves by being intimidated by this confusion."

<p>WENDY WEISER, wendy.weiser@nyu.edu,

<p>JUSTIN LEVITT, justin.levitt@nyu.edu, <a href="http://brennancenter.org">http://brennancenter.org</a> Weiser is deputy director of the Democracy Program at the Brennan 
Center for Justice at NYU School of Law, where she runs a voting rights 
project. Levitt is associate counsel with the Democracy Program at the 
Brennan Center.
<p>  In an op-ed she co-wrote for the New York Times, published 
yesterday, Weiser stated: "On November 7, many voters will encounter new 
voting machines, new computerized voter lists and new rules regarding 
registration and ID requirements. As primaries earlier this year 
demonstrated, local officials and poll workers are overwhelmed by all 
the changes -- some of them engineered by mischievous partisans who have 
passed laws and rules that would block many eligible citizens from 
voting. There is a silent disenfranchisement afoot --- one that could 
affect hundreds of thousands of voters. ...
<p>  "In the 2004 presidential election, some states were decided by less 
than 1 percent of the vote. This year, dozens of Congressional races 
could be close enough that vote suppression would affect them. ... 
Congress and state legislatures should spurn partisan attempts to 
manipulate elections by imposing new voting requirements, like proof of 
citizenship and identification. They should ban wireless components in 
voting machines and require an audited paper trail. Judges should 
continue to strike down illegal and anti-democratic laws. And citizens 
and journalists should demand to know who is being purged from the 
rolls, and why. All registered voters should cast their ballots and 
insist their votes be counted."
<p> Added Levitt: "At a minimum voters should demand a provisional ballot."
