<p>WASHINGTON - February 14 - Today, Media Matters  for America released the findings of its first in-depth study,  which indicates that conservative voices have significantly  outnumbered progressive voices on the Sunday shows throughout  former President Bill Clinton's second term (1997-2000),  President George W. Bush's first term (2001-2004), and 2005.</p>
<p>   The report -- titled If It's Sunday, It's Conservative --  includes content analysis of NBC's Meet the Press, CBS' Face the  Nation, and ABC's This Week, classifying each one of the nearly  7,000 guests who appeared during the 1997-2005 period as either  Democrat, Republican, conservative, progressive, or neutral.</p>
<p>   &quot;There is strong evidence indicating Democrats and  progressives have been systematically underrepresented on the  Sunday talk shows on ABC, CBS, and NBC no matter what party has  occupied the White House,&quot; said Paul Waldman, Senior Fellow at  Media Matters and author of the study. &quot;With a combined audience  of nearly 10 million households every week, the networks have  given conservatives and Republicans significantly more  opportunities to shape public debate and influence public  opinion.&quot;</p>
<p>   Among the study's key findings:</p>
<p>   -- During Clinton's second term, the right held a small  advantage in the balance between Democrats/progressives and  Republicans/conservatives: 52 percent of the ideologically  identifiable guests were from the right and 48 percent were from  the left. But in Bush's first term, Republicans and conservatives  held a dramatic advantage, outnumbering Democrats and  progressives by 58 percent to 42 percent. In 2005, the figures  were identical: 58 percent to 42 percent.</p>
<p>   -- Counting only elected officials and administration  representatives, Democrats had an eight-point advantage during  Clinton's second term, 53 percent to 45 percent. In Bush's first  term, however, the Republican advantage was 61 percent to 39  percent, nearly three times as large.</p>
<p>   -- In both the Clinton and Bush administrations, conservative  journalists were far more likely to appear on the Sunday shows  than were progressive journalists. In Clinton's second term, 61  percent of the ideologically identifiable journalists were  conservative; in Bush's first term, that figure rose to 69  percent.</p>
<p>   -- In 1997 and 1998, the shows conducted more solo interviews  with Democrats and progressives than with Republicans and  conservatives. But in every year since, there have been more solo  interviews with Republicans and conservatives.</p>
<p>   -- The most frequent Sunday show guest during this nine-year  period is Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) who has appeared 124 times. A  staggering 69 percent (86 out of 124) of McCain's appearances  have been solo interviews. Sen. Joseph Biden (D-DE) has been the  most frequent guest since 2003, but only 31 percent (25 out of  80) of his appearances have been solo interviews.</p>
<p>   -- In every year examined by the study -- 1997 through 2005 --  more multi-guest panel discussions tilted right (a greater number  of Republicans/conservatives than Democrats/progressives) than  tilted left. In some years, there were two, three, or even four  times as many right-titled panels as left-tilted panels.</p>
<p>   -- Congressional opponents of the Iraq war were largely absent  from the Sunday shows, particularly during the period just before  the war began.</p>
<p>   &quot;If conservative dominance in this major arena of public  opinion-making continues as it has the past nine years, it may  have serious consequences for future policy debates and  elections,&quot; said David Brock, President and CEO of Media Matters.  &quot;This study should serve as a wake-up call to anyone who thinks  they are seeing balanced discourse on Sunday mornings -- and to  those responsible for producing this imbalanced programming.&quot;</p>
<p>   While conducting the study, Media Matters asked the producers  of all three Sunday shows several questions, including: Why,  since the Bush administration began, have more  Republicans/conservatives appeared on your show than have  Democrats/ progressives? If It's Sunday, It's Conservative  includes their answers. Two of the respondents suggested that  their guest list often includes members of the party holding the  presidency and that the same was true during the Clinton  administration. However, as the report details, the data from the  Clinton years indicate a clear Republican/conservative advantage  -- an advantage that ballooned during Bush's first term.</p>
