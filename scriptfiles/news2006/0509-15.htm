<p>NEW YORK - May 9 - Today the Center for Constitutional Rights (CCR), which won the Supreme Court case establishing the Guantánamo detainees' right to challenge their detention in U.S. court (Rasul v. Bush), provided a rebuttal to President Bush's recent comments about closing the Guantánamo prison.  On Sunday, President Bush said he would "like to close the camp" and referring to the detainees, he added: "They will get their day in court.  One can't say that of the people that they killed."  

 

<p>CCR Legal Director Bill Goodman provided the following response:

 

<p>President Bush's comments reveal that again he is oblivious to the facts.  According to the Defense Department's own documents, nine out of ten detainees are not accused of being in Al-Qaeda.  By declaring detainees guilty before a trial has begun, the President is undermining due process and deceiving the public.  

 

<p>The President did not define his plan for closing Guantánamo, but so far his Administration has denied due process and transferred detainees abroad for further imprisonment and abuse.  While we would applaud the proper closing of Guantánamo as long overdue, closing the base will not automatically stop the abuse of human rights if these abuses and indefinite detention are simply transferred to other countries.  The Bush Administration has a record of running from the Constitution; it has outsourced torture and the President's comments do not rule out attempts to export its Guantánamo practices.  

 

<p>President Bush has an obligation to further explain any plans for closing Guantánamo, and Congress must hold thorough hearings to ensure that the failures of the President's Guantánamo policies are addressed, not simply hidden or exported.  The U.S. must provide due process to detainees who have been imprisoned without charges or trial.



<p>Statistics on the Pentagon records of detainees are available in a 2006 report from Seton Hall Law School.  CCR oversees 450 pro-bono attorneys representing the detainees and it filed two amicus briefs in the pending lawsuit of Hamdan v. Rumsfeld, challenging the legality of the Detainee Treatment Act and arguing that the principles embodied in the Geneva Conventions are enforceable in the U.S.
