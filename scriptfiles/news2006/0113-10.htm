<p>WASHINGTON - January 13 - The Baltimore Sun reports today: "The National Security Agency used law 
enforcement agencies, including the Baltimore Police Department, to 
track members of a city anti-war group as they prepared for protests 
outside the sprawling Fort Meade facility, internal NSA documents show.

<p>"The target of the clandestine surveillance was the Baltimore Pledge of 
Resistance, a group loosely affiliated with the local chapter of the 
American Friends Service Committee, whose members include many veteran 
city peace activists with a history of nonviolent civil disobedience." 
Full Sun story is here:

<p>Mark Goldstone, chair of the D.C. Chapter of the National Lawyers Guild 
Demonstration Support Committee, said: "This surveillance is completely 
unrelated to even an expansive definition of 'national security.' People 
should not be afraid to speak out, and unfortunately evidence of 
domestic spying tends to chill people's interest in speaking out -- thus 
chilling and limiting our precious First Amendment rights." [See:

<p>MAX OBUSZEWSKI, MObuszewski@afsc.org, <a href="http://www.iraqpledge.org">http://www.iraqpledge.org</a><p> A founding member of the Pledge of Resistance-Baltimore, Obuszewski 
said today: "The NSA documents describe the Pledge or Resistance as a 
'threat.' The only threat that the Pledge of Resistance poses is that it 
speaks truth to power, which may contribute to ending the Bush 
administration's war and occupation of Iraq.
  <p>  "Besides challenging the NSA, the Pledge has been lobbying local 
senators and representatives to speak out against the war. On January 
13, Pledge members intend to go to Congressperson Ben Cardin's Baltimore 
office and read Martin Luther King's Riverside Church speech, April 4, 
1967, when he came out against the Vietnam War." 
<p>Text and audio of the 
King speech is available at: <a href="http://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/mlkatimetobreaksilence.htm">http://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/mlkatimetobreaksilence.htm</a>

<p>MARIA ALLWINE, mariarichard@verizon.net, 
<a href="http://democracyrising.us/content/view/402/164">http://democracyrising.us/content/view/402/164</a><p>Allwine, also a member of the Pledge of Resistance, said today: 
"Once we have exhausted all avenues of petitioning, such as faxes, 
emails and face to face meetings with our representatives, what are we 
supposed to do next? Go home and be quiet? Once we do that, we are no 
longer a free society.
   <p> "Surveillance of peaceful, constitutionally protected activities has 
a chilling effect, as it is designed to do. There were a couple of 
people in our group who were here on Green Cards who were concerned that 
they could be deported. They expressed fear and no longer participate 
with us, although they wanted to continue."
