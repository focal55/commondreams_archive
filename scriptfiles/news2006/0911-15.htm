<p>NEW YORK  - September 11 - Communities across America are gearing up for the Environmental Justice for All, Tour '06, launched by a coalition of over 70 environmental justice, social justice, public health, human rights, and worker’s rights groups to highlight the devastating impact of toxic contamination on people of color and in poor communities across the United States. Three bus caravans carrying activists, health researchers, environmental scientists, and public policy experts will tour communities in the Northeast, South, and West Coast, where people are suffering serious health effects associated with toxic pollution. Organizers say the tour will provide advocacy tools to affected communities and put pressure on Congressional leaders to make the elimination of environmental hazards a priority issue in the upcoming elections. 

 

<p>“This Environmental Justice Tour will bring together grassroots communities from across the country, to help them realize that they are not alone in their fight against the toxic contamination of their communities,” said Hilton Kelley, a Port Arthur, TX native and national spokesperson for the tour.  “This tour will also identify resources for these community groups in their struggle. A tour like this has been long overdue,” Kelley added. 

 

<p>Stops along the Tour will include towns such as Port Arthur, TX; Newark, NJ; and Fort Ord, CA, communities that have suffered widespread and significant health effects due to the persistent presence of industrial toxins in their air, water, and food. 

 

<p>The low-income, African American community of Port Arthur, TX is located in the heart of “Gasoline Alley,” home to four international oil refineries, and some of the dirtiest air in the nation.  Port Arthur is about 90% African American, with a 13.5% unemployment rate, and a quarter of its residents living at or below the poverty level.  Currently, environmental justice activists in Port Arthur are battling a proposal from gasoline giant Motiva, a part of Shell Oil, to expand their facilities in Port Arthur.  Activists claim that the proposed expansion, which would make the facility the largest in the nation, is an environmental injustice to the largely African American community living on the fenceline. 

 

<p>The largely working-class, multi-ethnic Ironbound community in Newark, NJ is home to the largest solid waste incinerator in the Northeast and numerous hazardous waste sites, including a Diamond alkali Superfund site that makes Newark the largest dioxin contaminated site in the world.  Environmental activists in Ironbound are currently challenging a proposed action which would dump waste from New York City to landfills in Ironbound.

 

<p>Fort Ord, an army post in Northern California is recognized by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency as one of the most contaminated Superfund sites in the nation.  Residents of Fort Ord are routinely exposed to hazardous toxins from two leaky landfills, burning of military munitions and littered ammunition, and contaminated groundwater from the improper disposal of cleaning solvent carbon tetrachloride, a cancer causing agent.

 

<p>The Tour will also stop in Gulf Coast communities, where the combined effects of global warming and toxic pollution are undermining the recovery of areas destroyed during Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.

 

<p>Each of these communities is engaged in solution-driven efforts that draw attention to a broken U.S. environmental protection system that defends old polluting industries instead of requiring innovative and safer technologies, and establishing safeguards for protecting human health from industrial toxins and hazards.

 

<p>The Environmental Justice for All, Tour '06  was inspired at a meeting of environmental justice and public health groups from across the country who joined together to draw attention to the work of local activists in West Louisville, KY, dubbed by industry as “Rubbertown.”  The collaboration of these groups brought light to the one-half mile stretch adjacent to an African American neighborhood where 12 toxic industrial facilities have left the area polluted, and people sick and dying.
