<p>PEAKS ISLAND, Maine - March 8 - The last time Annie and Perry O'Brien were on a peace march together, she was 
carrying him in a Snugli. From March 14 to 19, they'll be walking side by 
side from Mobile, Alabama, to New Orleans on the Veterans' and Survivors' March 
for Peace and Justice. The O'Briens, a mother and son from Peaks Island, Maine, 
are supported by more than 60 individuals who are sponsoring their walk.

<p>Perry, a 23-year-old veteran of the war in Afghanistan where he served as a 
medic with the 82nd Airborne, was honorably discharged as a conscientious 
objector in November 2004. He has created a website to guide soldiers through the 
process of applying for conscientious objection (<a href="http://www.peace-out.com">www.peace-out.com</a>) and has 
been active with Veterans for Peace and Iraq Veterans Against the War since his 
discharge. He is currently a student at Cornell University. 

<p>In addition to participating in the march, the mother-son team is also 
partnering in writing a book about nonviolence for children, to be published in 2008 
by Charlesbridge Publishers of Watertown, MA. Annie (Anne Sibley O'Brien) is 
a well known illustrator and author who  has published 25 children's books.  
In 1997 she won the National Education Association's Author-Illustrator Human & 
Civil Rights Award.  

<p>The Veterans' and Survivors' March for Peace and Justice 
(<a href="http://www.vetgulfmarch.org">www.vetgulfmarch.org</a>) is an action of Veterans For Peace, Iraq Veterans Against the War, Military 
Families Speak Out, and other veteran and family organizations, in coalition 
with organizations supporting victims of Hurricane Katrina.  Veterans of wars 
abroad along with the survivors of Katrina and Rita are joining together for 
this march and caravan to establish ties of material solidarity between those 
who oppose the war abroad and the social and economic costs for working people 
at home. It will arrive in New Orleans on the third anniversary of the 
invasion and occupation of Iraq.
