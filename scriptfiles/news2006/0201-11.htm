<p>WASHINGTON - February 1 - A Seattle-based program  manager won first prize today in the Since Sliced Bread contest for  his idea to create Sustainable Resource Industries.  The  unprecedented contest engaged tens of thousands of Americans who  submitted bold new ideas to strengthen the economy and improve life  for working men and women and their families.  Peter Skidmore, a  father of two, received a $100,000 check from the Service Employees  International Union (SEIU) at a ceremony in Washington, D.C. and a  commitment from the union to work to make his idea a reality.</p>
<p>   Two runners-up in the Since Sliced Bread contest each received  checks for $50,000.  Leslie Hester, a 26-year old graduate student  studying forestry in Raleigh, North Carolina, would reform public  education by redistributing tax revenues for schools, controlling  tuition at public universities, and raising teacher salaries.   Filippo Menczer, a 40-year-old associate professor at the Indiana  University in Bloomington, would tie the minimum wage to the cost of  living.</p>
<p>   Other finalists include a Provost Marshall in the U.S. Army who  wants to create a Civil Works Corps, a grandmother who wants to  teach children money management, a tutor who wants to separate  health care from employment and create a special sales tax to fund  national health insurance, and a divinity student who wants to  establish a mortgage program to repair dilapidated houses.  The  contest attracted more than 22,000 policy ideas addressing jobs,  health care, wages, retirement security and much more. </p>
<p>   &quot;Last night, we heard what the President thinks the country  needs, and the Democratic response,&quot; said SEIU President Andy  Stern.  &quot;We're here this morning to talk about what Americans think  will improve their lives.  Through the Since Sliced Bread contest,  SEIU asked the public to tell us what will help the U.S. compete in  the global economy and make work pay.  The response was remarkable.   We received more than 22,000 ideas, from people in every state and  every congressional district.  More than 40,000 people voted to  choose the winners.&quot;</p>
<p>   &quot;It has been exciting to be part of such a big conversation about  what matters -- that to me is the essence of a democratic society,&quot;  Skidmore says.  His idea involves imposing a &quot;resource tax&quot; on pollution, development, and fossil fuel to pay for development of  renewable energy and environmental restoration.  &quot;Promoting  sustainable localized energy industries (solar, wind, hydro, tidal,  biofuels) will provide reliable, clean homegrown energy, exportable  technologies, and bring energy jobs home,&quot; it says.  &quot;Funding  widespread environmental restoration will expand existing industries  (farming, recreation, tourism, and commercial fisheries) that are  dependent on ecological services and will foster research, design  and technology industries.&quot;  Skidmore works for the Nature  Conservancy, which did not endorse his idea.</p>
<p>   &quot;This contest accomplished something extraordinary,&quot; Stern  added.  &quot;We got ideas from liberals and conservatives.  College  students and grandmothers joined the conversation.  People who are  unemployed and people with large incomes sent us ideas.  People are  hungry for this conversation.  They have ideas, and they want to be  heard.&quot;</p>
<p>   &quot;It's been wonderful to realize that public education is a  priority for so many fellow Americans,&quot; Hester said.  &quot;I want to  thank Since Sliced Bread for providing a unique forum for idea  solicitation and sharing. It's been fun!&quot;</p>
<p>   Menczer says he considers himself lucky to have a good job, but  knows that others do not.  &quot;I have learned a lot from others'  comments about the issues surrounding my idea on the minimum wage.   I am excited that the finalist ideas address important needs like  sustainable resources, health care, and (in my case) the working  poor.&quot;</p>
<p>   A panel of leading economists, thinkers, businesspeople, labor  leaders, activists and Wall Street investors selected the top 21  ideas to be voted on.  The panel includes such notable names as  former United States Senator Bill Bradley, former Environmental  Protection Agency Administrator Carol Browner, former Secretary of  the Army Louis E. Caldera, Teach for America Founder Wendy Kopp, CEO  of Three Oaks LLC Ginger Lew, and Republican strategist Ed Rollins.</p>
<p>   Stern said the winners will be honored in a full-page  advertisement in USA Today tomorrow, Feb. 2.  He encouraged people  to go to <a href="http://releases.usnewswire.com/redir.asp?ReleaseID=60320&Link=http://www.sinceslicedbread.com">http://www.sinceslicedbread.com</a> and send their favorite  idea to their Senators, Representative and Governor.  Later this  month, <a href="http://releases.usnewswire.com/redir.asp?ReleaseID=60320&Link=http://www.sinceslicedbread.com">http://www.sinceslicedbread.com</a> will invite visitors to sort  the ideas by topic so they can be sent to lawmakers.  &quot;We received a  wealth of smart, creative ideas in this contest,&quot; Stern added.  &quot;We  are committed to sharing them with lawmakers and opinion leaders  over the next several months.&quot;</p>
