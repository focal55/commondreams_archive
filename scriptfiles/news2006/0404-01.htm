<p>* Election Interference
<p>* America's Blinders
<p>* The Logic of Withdrawal

<p>JERRY STARR, <a href="mailto:jmstarr@adelphia.net">jmstarr@adelphia.net</a>, <a href="http://www.teachvietnam.net" target="_new">http://www.teachvietnam.net</a>
<p>Author of <i>"<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0945919212/commondreams-20/ref=nosim" target="_new">The Lessons of the Vietnam War</a>,"</i> Starr said today: "The 
U.S. government is openly manipulating the construction of the Iraqi 
government. For the past half century, the U.S. has intervened in 
elections on behalf of candidates and parties considered most responsive 
to U.S. interests, including Iran and Guatemala in 1954, Vietnam from 
1954-73, the Dominican Republic in 1965, and now in the Mideast. It's 
difficult to dictate election processes while, at the same time, 
persuading the larger population that your claims about their future 
independence are credible."

<p>HOWARD ZINN, <a href="mailto:hzinn2@yahoo.com">hzinn2@yahoo.com</a>, <a href="http://www.howardzinn.org" target="_new">http://howardzinn.org</a>
<p>Available for a limited number of interviews, Zinn wrote the 1967 
book <i>"<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/089608681X/commondreams-20/ref=nosim" target="_new">Vietnam: The Logic of Withdrawal</a>."</i> He is also author of the 
bestseller "A People's History of the United States." His most recent 
piece is "America's Blinders," in which he writes: "Now that most 
Americans no longer believe in the war, now that they no longer trust 
Bush and his administration, now that the evidence of deception has 
become overwhelming, we might ask: How come so many people were so 
easily fooled? ... The deeply ingrained belief -- no, not from birth but 
from the educational system and from our culture in general -- that the 
United States is an especially virtuous nation makes us especially 
vulnerable to government deception."

<p>ANTHONY ARNOVE, <a href="mailto:arnove@igc.org">arnove@igc.org</a>,<a href="http://www.inthesetimes.com/site/main/article/2555" target="_new">http://www.inthesetimes.com/site/main/article/2555</a>
<p>Arnove is author of the recently-released book "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1595580794/commondreams-20/ref=nosim" target="_new">Iraq: The Logic of 
Withdrawal</a>," which has an introduction by Zinn. Arnove wrote recently: 
"Al-Qaeda made its first appearance in Iraq only after the invasion, a 
predictable outcome of the U.S. occupation. ... Even more circular is 
the idea that the United States has to stay in Iraq until it 'defeats' 
the resistance to the occupation. The occupation itself is the source of 
the resistance, a fact that even some of the people responsible for the 
war have been forced to acknowledge."
