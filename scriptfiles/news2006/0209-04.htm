<p> ANNAPOLIS, Maryland - February 9 - The following was  released today by the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence  regarding Maryland Sen. John Giannetti and gun laws:</p>
<p>   Sen. John Giannetti, the Democrat who killed Maryland's  assault weapons ban two years ago, called the Brady Campaign  after a Jan. 19 press release to say his actions on the assault  weapons legislation had been distorted out of context, and that  he was a strong supporter of the Brady Campaign’s agenda. </p>
<p>   The truth is that Giannetti has embraced the NRA's agenda with  an enthusiasm that even his colleagues find embarrassing. For  example:</p>
<p>   -- He voted last year to repeal Maryland's landmark ballistic  identification system, which uses cutting edge technology to help  police trace shell casings found at crime scenes to the guns --  and the criminals -- who fired them.  Shortly after Giannetti  voted for a bill to repeal the system, Prince George's County  prosecutors used the system to identify and convict a murder  suspect, and the bill was scuttled.</p>
<p>   -- Giannetti voted against legislation that would have set  minimum security standards for gun dealers. Burglaries at gun  stores are a major source of firearms for criminals, and  prosecutors testified that dozens of stolen firearms taken from  Maryland gun stores are used to commit violent crimes every year,  yet some gun dealers fail to keep weapons adequately secured.</p>
<p>   -- He voted against requiring gun owners to report the theft  or loss of a firearm promptly, despite testimony that these  reports help police track down guns that have fallen into the  hands of criminals. In some cases, police find that owners  falsely claim that their guns were lost or stolen when confronted  with evidence that the firearms were used in crimes.</p>
<p>   The Brady Campaign named Sen. Giannetti as one of its  principal national targets for the 2006 election season in a  letter to hundreds of thousands of supporters late last year.  </p>
<p>   The letter said &quot;We will also punish those state legislators  who stand in the way of our legislative priorities.  In  Maryland's 21st Senate District, Senator John Giannetti (D),  killed the state assault weapons ban.  Senator Giannetti must pay  the price for allowing high-powered killing machines on the  streets of Maryland.  We will target his race and replace him  with someone who will make sensible gun laws a priority.&quot;</p>
