<p>NEW YORK - October 30 - Several US state laws and regulations on 
abortion chip away at every woman's right to have a safe and legal 
abortion, Human Rights Watch said in a briefing paper released today. 

<p>The mounting obstacles to abortion services include in some states a legal 
requirement to provide medically inaccurate information as part of 
obligatory pre-abortion counseling. For example, some state regulations 
compel doctors and nurses to say that abortion leads to breast cancer and 
that fetuses feel pain throughout the pregnancy. Both claims are 
scientifically unfounded.

<p>"These regulations undoubtedly are a back-door attempt to curtail 
women's rights. There is a direct assault on women's right to safe abortion 
through deliberate misinformation," said Marianne Mollmann, advocacy 
director in Human Rights Watch's Women's Rights Division.

<p>Several US state laws and regulations on abortion may in fact contravene 
Supreme Court rulings. Since 1973, the Supreme Court has consistently 
held that states cannot place an "undue" regulatory burden on a woman or 
girl seeking to terminate her pregnancy. But some regulations do just that, 
notably where the law compels the mandatory imposition of false 
information.  

<p>States have also sought to curtail access to abortion by re-imposing 
criminal sanctions for the provision of services. Most prominent is the 
blanket ban on abortion in South Dakota, signed into law in March, and 
subject to a state referendum during the mid-term elections next week. 
South Dakota's law makes abortion illegal except when the procedure is 
carried out to save the pregnant woman's life. Several other states, 
including Georgia, Indiana, Ohio, Louisiana and Tennessee, have moved 
to enact similar legislation.

<p>"Experience shows that criminalizing abortion does not eliminate the need 
for it," said Mollmann. "Criminal sanctions only push the provision of 
abortion services underground with potentially fatal consequences to the 
woman. As the United States gears up for elections, I sincerely hope no 
US politician favors a policy option that places women's health and lives 
at real risk."

<p>Access to abortion has also been curtailed for pregnant girls, who are 
subject to additional restrictions. At present, more than 20 states enforce 
parental consent laws, requiring consent from a parent before a minor may 
obtain an abortion. These consent laws have serious adverse consequences 
for precisely those pregnant girls who cannot rely on parental support at a 
time of crisis pregnancy, and fail to ensure that the best interest of the 
pregnant girl is central to decisions about abortion.

<p>Federal legislators have moved to strengthen the enforcement of such 
parental consent laws. In July, the Senate passed the Child Custody 
Protection Act, a version of which had already passed as the Child 
Interstate Abortion Notification Act in the House of Representatives in 
April 2005. If this law enters into force, any adult - including a guardian, 
grandparent, teacher or religious counselor - who helps a girl cross a state 
line to procure an abortion in circumvention of state parental consent or 
notification laws would be committing a federal crime.  

<p>"Fortunately, most pregnant teenagers who need an abortion find support 
in their parents," said Mollmann. "But those who don't find parental 
support need all the friends they can get," said Mollmann. "The Child 
Custody Protection Act and its similarly draconian House version ignore 
this basic truth and leave pregnant teenagers without family support to 
fend for themselves."
