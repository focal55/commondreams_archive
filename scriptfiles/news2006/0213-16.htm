NEW YORK - February 13 - 
		<span class="published-content-body"> When George W. Bush announced on February 9 that an Al-Qaeda plot
against a building in Los Angeles had been "thwarted," many television
newscasts took the administration's claims as fact.<br>
<br>
<span class="media_outlet">ABC</span> <span class="media_outlet">World News Tonight</span> anchor Charles Gibson reported (2/9/06) that "President Bush today
revealed some details of a terrorist plot that was foiled," later
putting this question to <span class="media_outlet">ABC</span> reporter Pierre Thomas: "So what were the details of the plot and how
was it foiled?" After a brief summary of the administration's story of
the plot and some soundbites from terrorism experts on the general
threat posed by Al-Qaeda, Thomas concluded that "disaster was averted."<br>
<br>
<span class="media_outlet">CNN</span>'s Miles O'Brien (2/10/06)
displayed a similar lack of skepticism: "The president was talking
terror yesterday, and lifting a veil on a thwarted Al-Qaeda attack that
aimed to fly a hijacked airliner into a L.A. skyscraper in early 2002." Unsurprisingly, conservative commentators like <span class="media_outlet">Fox</span>'s Bill O'Reilly were upset that the media weren't credulous enough; O'Reilly (2/10/06) singled out the <span class="media_outlet">New York Times</span> (2/10/06) for failing to give the story prominent placement: "Of
course, on page 22 is the terror thing that they stopped an attack on
Los Angeles. Page 22."<br>
<br>
<span class="media_outlet">CBS Evening News</span> anchor Bob Schieffer
announced (2/9/06) that "for the first time President Bush confirmed
today that in the months after 9/11, the government broke up another
terrorist plot to fly a plane into the tallest building in Los
Angeles." The fact that Bush says something does not "confirm" that
what he is saying is true—and in fact, earlier reporting by the <span class="media_outlet">Los Angeles Times</span> casts doubts on Bush's claims.<br>
<br>

As an <span class="media_outlet">NPR</span> report (2/10/06) recalled, "Elements of the plot have been described before, notably in the <span class="media_outlet">L.A. Times</span>." But the earliest <span class="media_outlet">Times</span> report (3/31/04) included a significant caveat about Khalid Sheikh
Mohammed, the Al-Qaeda operative who allegedly planned the L.A. attack: "Law enforcement officials, however, caution that Mohammed's statements
since his capture have been viewed with a degree of skepticism by U.S.
intelligence."<br>
<br>

The next <span class="media_outlet">Times</span> story (10/8/05),
headlined "Scope of Plots Bush Says Were Foiled Is Questioned," cited
"several counter-terrorism officials" as saying that "the plot never
progressed past the planning stages.... 'To take that and make it into
a disrupted plot is just ludicrous,' said one senior FBI official." "At
most," the story suggested, "it was a plan that was stopped in its
initial stages and was not an operational plot that had been disrupted
by authorities."<br>
<br>

In the current round of reporting on the story, some newspapers have noted the dissent over the alleged plot.  The <span class="media_outlet">Washington Post</span> (2/10/06) cited "several U.S. intelligence officials" who "said there
is deep disagreement within the intelligence community over the
seriousness of the Library Tower scheme and whether it was ever much
more than talk." And the <span class="media_outlet">New York Daily News</span> (2/10/06) cited one senior counterterrorism official who said: "There
was no definitive plot. It never materialized or got past the thought
stage."<br>
<br>
 Such skepticism should have been the norm in the media—especially given
the White House's record of deception (e.g., FAIR press release, <a href="http://www.democracyinaction.org/dia/track.jsp?key=82256012&url_num=16&url=http://www.fair.org/index.php?page=1841" target="_blank" title="">7/18/03</a>).</span><!-- #EndEditable -->
