<p>WASHINGTON - October 10 - <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">National 
        and local Washington, D.C., area gun violence prevention, youth, and community 
        organizations delivered a letter today to Washington Redskins owner Daniel 
        M. Snyder urging him to cancel the Redskins' hosting of the second annual "Redskins Sporting Clays Challenge, presented by NRA [National Rifle Association] 
        Sports," on Tuesday, October 17, at the Prince George's County Trap and 
        Skeet Center. The event is to benefit Washington Redskins Charitable Foundation, 
        the mission statement of which declares that the foundation works to "make 
        a positive and measurable impact on youth in the greater Washington, D.C. 
        region," including their "health and wellness." [See <a href="http://www.vpc.org/vpcletter2006.pdf">http://www.vpc.org/vpcletter2006.pdf 
        </a>for a copy of the letter.] </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The letter notes, 
        "At the same time that the District of Columbia is under a `Crime Emergency' 
        and its young people are continuing to pay a disproportionately high price 
        in death and injury due to gun homicide, the National Rifle Association 
        is continuing its efforts to overturn D.C.'s landmark gun laws. The October 
        2006 issue of the NRA's <i>America's 1st Freedom</i> magazine features 
        a column condemning D.C.'s `draconian gun control system' and declaring, 
        `It's time to overturn the D.C. gun law....'" </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Federal bills to repeal 
        the District of Columbia's gun laws promoted by the NRA would: legalize 
        handguns as well as semiautomatic assault weapons and 50 caliber sniper 
        rifles; allow any person to carry, openly or concealed, loaded handguns 
        and other concealable firearms in houses, places of business, or other 
        land "possessed by that person"; and, severely weaken the District's ban 
        on armor-piercing handgun ammunition. At the same time, it stands as an 
        outrageous attack by an outside special interest group on the home rule 
        rights of D.C. residents. </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Noting that this is 
        the second year that this event has been held—despite public protests 
        held by D.C. organizations last October calling for its cancellation—the 
        letter states, "While the NRA may have convinced the Redskins that it 
        is somehow possible to separate the NRA's political agenda from other 
        components of the organization, this rationalization is false and, to 
        be frank, an insult to those whose lives have been ended or changed forever 
        by the NRA's pro-gun, anti-public safety policies and actions. Recognizing 
        that gun violence is one of the single most prevalent, and preventable, 
        factors that can affect the `health and wellness' of youth in the Washington, 
        D.C., area, we urge the Washington Redskins to end all participation in 
        this event. The Washington Redskins Charitable Foundation's involvement 
        with an organization whose mission is to repeal Washington D.C.'s gun 
        laws cannot be reconciled with the mission of the foundation."</font>
