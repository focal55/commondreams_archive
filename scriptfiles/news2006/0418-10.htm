<p>WASHINGTON  - April 18 - On Good Friday, April 14, 2006, President Bush and Vice-President Cheney released
their federal income tax returns for 2005. An analysis by Citizens for Tax Justice of the
White House figures shows:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Due to the 2001-05 Bush tax cuts, the President’s 2005 income tax was reduced
by $26,204.<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>The President’s income tax rate was 25.4 percent of his reported income.
Without his tax-cut legislation, he would have paid 29.0 percent.<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>Vice-President Dick Cheney’s 2005 income tax bill was reduced by $1,093,937
due to the Bush tax cuts.<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>The Vice-President’s income tax rate was only 5.7 percent of his $9.1 million
reported income. Without the Bush tax cuts, he would have paid 17.7 percent. </li>
</ul>
<p>President Bush’s $26,000 tax cut stemmed from both the lower regular tax rates and
his reduction in the top tax rate on dividends from 39.6 percent to 15 percent.
Vice-President Cheney’s $1.1 million tax cut in part reflected the lower regular tax rates
and the 15 percent tax rate on capital gains and dividends. Cheney also was able to
take an additional $2.5 million in itemized deductions due to a tax-law change signed
by Bush in 2005, which was ostensibly designed to encourage charitable donations to
the victims of Hurricane Katrina.
<p>Normally, charitable deductions cannot offset more than half of a taxpayer’s adjusted
gross income. (Unused deductions can be carried forward for possible use in later
years.) A special rule for 2005, however, allows unlimited charitable deductions if made
after August 27, the date of the Katrina disaster. The law does not require that these
donations be linked in any way to hurricane relief.
<p>None of Cheney’s charitable donations went to hurricane victims. Instead, they went to
the Washington, D.C. hospital that takes care of his heart condition, the University of
Wyoming (his alma mater), and Capital Partners for Education, which helps low-income
Washington, D.C. students pay private school tuition.

Tax Justice, follow.
