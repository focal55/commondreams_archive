<p>WASHINGTON - May 16 - It has been more than four months since the Sago Mine disaster in Buckhannon, West Virginia took the lives of 12 coal miners. Since that time 14 other coal miners have perished as a result of mine injuries. It&rsquo;s crystal clear that immediate action is needed to improve mine safety measures to prevent more unnecessary deaths. But the Republican leadership in Congress has dragged its feet and refused to act. 
<P>The mine safety legislation proposed today by Rep. George Miller, Rep. Nick Rahall and others would update the decades old communications technology, ensure adequate oxygen availability, and improve rapid emergency response in the event of disaster so that miners have a fighting chance to survive. It would also prohibit the use of dangerous conveyor belts to supply air to the mines and put some teeth into Mine Safety Health Administration (MSHA) enforcement and penalties. </P><P>The twelve men who died at Sago, and the others who have been killed, should not have died in vain. Coal miners and their family members deserve action from the Congress &ndash; now &ndash; to stop the carnage in the nation&rsquo;s mines.
