<p>NEW YORK - April 5 - Today attorneys from the Center for Constitutional Rights (CCR) responded to a new Amnesty International Report about the U.S. Government's use of "Secret flights to torture and 'disappearance,'" emphasizing that the records of hundreds of flights directly linked to the CIA provides more evidence that the Bush Administration is systematically advancing the use of torture as U.S. government policy.  CCR represents detainees at the Guantánamo Bay Naval Station and victims of torture and "rendition," including Maher Arar, a Canadian citizen who was taken into custody while traveling through JFK international airport and sent to Syria for torture.

 

<p>The following is a statement from Bill Goodman, CCR Legal Director:

 

<p>"These new disclosures again demonstrate our contention that the U.S. government is systematically outsourcing torture.  The flight records reveal a disturbing pattern of secret human rights abuse around the world, from the U.S. to Guantánamo Bay to Djibouti.  It is shameful that the Bush Administration has used the CIA and private aircraft operators to send people abroad for torture, and now that these practices have been exposed, the Administration and these companies must be held accountable.  Congress overwhelmingly voted to ban torture and the American people do not want torture practiced in their name - not on our soil, and not hidden in another country.  

 

<p>"Below the radar: Secret flights to torture and 'disappearance'" is available at Amnesty International's website.  Information about CCR's cases, including legal challenges to outsourcing torture, is available on CCR's website.
