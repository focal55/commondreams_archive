<p>WASHINGTON - April 12 - In the first major restructuring of the Ohio union movement in nearly 50 years, 600 Ohio union leaders from over 30 international unions gathered Saturday to launch the New Alliance reorganization plan to help unite the grassroots power of the Ohio union movement. 

<p>“The challenges facing working families in this state are enormous and working people are depending on a strong grassroots labor movement that is ready and able to fight for their basic issues. The Ohio union movement has stepped up to the challenge in a major way,” said AFL-CIO Executive Vice-President Linda Chavez-Thompson, who chaired the Ohio convocation. “Through the New Alliance, Ohio unions will grow stronger and fight smarter on behalf of the workers they represent.” 

<p>Under the New Alliance reorganization plan, Ohio’s 36 Central Labor Councils (CLCs) have been consolidated to 22, each working under one of six regional labor powerhouses or Area Labor Federations (ALFs). Each Area Labor Federation will have full time staff to run a year round mobilization program that supports workers’ efforts to form unions, ensures workers have a voice in the political realm and advocates for good jobs in Ohio. The new structure uses resources more efficiently, establishes a statewide strategic planning committee for all Ohio labor bodies, and includes provisions that ensure diversity in the leadership and governance of the new area federations. 

<p>“Workers in Ohio need a union movement that is as powerful and united as possible,” said Bill Burga, President of the Ohio AFL-CIO. “For the first time, our national, state and local labor bodies will be working out of the same playbook to achieve the same goals.” 

<p>“The New Alliance builds the permanent mobilization network that working families need to meet the challenges of the 21st Century in politics, legislation, and organizing” said federation political director Karen Ackerman. She challenged participants at the convocation “to defeat anti-worker GOP Senator Mike DeWine, elect a pro-union Governor and U.S. Congress in 2006 and win a state wide ballot initiative to increase the state’s minimum wage.” 

<p>The New Alliance is the result of scores of meetings and discussions among Ohio’s state and local labor leaders and activists over the past five months. The Convocation of over 600 union leaders adopted the New Alliance plan with an overwhelming 86 percent majority. Ohio now joins nine other states and the District of Columbia who have completed the AFL-CIO "New Alliance" restructuring plan.
