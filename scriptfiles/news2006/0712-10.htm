<p>ATHENS, Greece - July 12 - Greenpeace today warned that the 
illegal killing of  scores of  whales and dolphins  in the Mediterranean 
sea will continue until Mediterranean countries get serious about 
enforcing a long standing ban on illegal driftnet  fishing in their sea. 
The environmental organisation  demanded that Mediterranean countries  
properly manage their  fisheries and finally commit to a network of 
marine reserves to protect the sea's fish stock from dying, Greenpeace 
said today.

<p>"If people are horrified by the images of the whales being harpooned in 
the Southern Ocean , they'd be equally repulsed by the thousands of 
dolphins and other creatures that are being entangled and killed  by 
fisherman using huge illegal driftnets each season in the 
Mediterranean," said Sofia Tsenikli of Greenpeace Greece aboard the 
Rainbow Warrior. "It's illegal, it's immoral and it's time it was 
stopped. A ban should mean a ban."

<p>Greenpeace's flagship the Rainbow Warrior has spent the past three weeks 
on the  high seas off the coasts of Greece and Italy confronting  rogue 
fishing vessels and confiscating their  driftnets, known as 'walls of 
death', up to 15km in length and 15m deep that are still being used to 
fish a dwindling stock of swordfish despite United Nations and European 
Union bans. (1)

<p>"The Mediterranean countries cannot have it both ways- bad management 
and overfishing have already wiped out 80% of the Mediterranean's tuna 
stock (2);  the region's flagrant disregard for the driftnets ban that 
it signed up to, together with continuing mis-management of the 
fisheries threaten to take swordfish and other species down the same 
path unless they take action to protect their sea immediately," said 
Alessandro Gianni of Greenpeace Italy. "Unfortunately, for every 
driftnet rounded up, countless vessels are still getting away with murder."

<p>Belated round-ups by the Italian authorities over the past 6 months have 
reportedly captured over 400 km of illegal driftnets from ships which 
have already received large grants from the EU to change fishing gear 
since the ban came into effect. (3)

<p>Greenpeace is calling on the Mediterranean countries to establish a  
network  of Marine Reserves covering  40% of the Mediterranean sea. 
Elsewhere around the world marine reserves have  increased the  number 
of species and regenerated the fish populations. (4)

<p>"With proper and legally enforced management of the fish stocks outside 
the reserves, both commercial and conservation interests can be met, 
said  Tsenikli. "

<p>"Over the past 3 weeks we've been on dives both in and around Marine 
Reserves and  well away from them too. In the Marine Reserves that were 
properly managed there's plenty of fish. Elsewhere, the sea's bereft. 
Time is  fast running out," concluded Tsenikli.

<p>From Greece the Rainbow Warrior continues on its three-month tour
'Defending Our Mediterranean' and travels next to Turkey, where it will 
work with scientists from Turkey and Israel to carry out a survey of 
whales and dolphins, as well as documenting some of the polluted and 
pristine sites along the Turkish coastline.

<p>(3) One of the illegal driftnet vessels that confronted Greenpeace off 
the coast of Italy had been compensated some 28 000 euros to change its 
fishing gear. Another had received nearly 10 000 euros.

<p>(4) Greenpeace Mediterranean Marine Reserve proposal includes known 
spawning and nursery grounds of swordfish and important areas for 
dolphins and whales. With proper and legally enforced management of the 
fish stocks outside the reserves, both commercial and conservation 
interests can be met. See, "Marine Reserves for the Mediterranean Sea",
