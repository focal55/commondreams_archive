WASHINGTON - June 7 - The Interfaith Alliance applauds the United States Senate for striking down the Federal Marriage Amendment that would impede on the religious liberty of all Americans.  However, TIA is outraged that the religious freedom this country was founded on is being used as a political football during election-year politics geared towards strengthening one party's base. 

<p>The proposed Constitutional Amendment would have imposed one religious definition of marriage over other religious views. This would take the debate and power away from houses of worship to decide who they will or will not marry and put it squarely in the hands of the federal government. 

<p>"For those people who want to protect marriage, let me offer a few suggestions," said the Rev. Welton Gaddy, President of The Interfaith Alliance. "Raise the public's consciousness of the dignity and importance of women in our still deeply patriarchal society; increase the minimum wage and offer tax breaks to the working poor so that spouses can see each other for quality lengths of time, rather than briefly passing on their way to two jobs; encourage family planning; start a plan to deal with domestic violence; and work to cover mental health care in medical insurance policies so serious emotional difficulties can be prevented from tearing marriages apart."

<p>Gaddy stressed these are real world solutions for dealing with the real world problem of protecting marriage and thanked members of The Interfaith Alliance for lending the support and time to fight the amendment. 

<p>"Our grassroots activists helped stop this amendment," said Gaddy.  "More than 5,000 members of The Interfaith Alliance contacted their Senators by email, phone call, fax or letter telling them to stay out of the houses of worship for the sake of religion and the institution of marriage."

<p>The U.S. House is looking to introduce similar legislation as early as this summer and The Interfaith Alliance will continue its work to ensure religious liberty for all Americans.<!-- #EndEditable -->
