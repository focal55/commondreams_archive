<p>WASHINGTON - October 2 - The globalization of the  arms industry has opened up major loopholes in all current arms  export regulations, allowing sales to human rights abusers and  countries under arms embargoes, according to a new report by the  Control Arms Campaign. </p>
<p>   The report, &quot;Arms without Borders,&quot; was launched today as the  United Nations opened its annual session on arms control, in the  run up to a landmark vote at the UN to start work on an Arms  Trade Treaty.</p>
<p>   The report reveals that U.S., EU and Canadian companies are  among those able to circumvent arms regulations by selling weapon  components and subcontracting arms manufacturing overseas. The  report details how weapons, including attack helicopters and  combat trucks, are being assembled from foreign components and  manufactured under license in countries including China, Egypt,  India, Israel and Turkey. </p>
<p>   The report shows how these or similar weapons have ended up in  destinations such as Colombia, Sudan and Uzbekistan where they  have reportedly been used for the killing and displacement of  civilians, highlighting the urgent need for global rules to  regulate an increasingly globalized industry.  </p>
<p>   &quot;This report reveals a litany of loopholes and destroyed  lives. Arms companies are global, yet arms regulations are not,  and the result is the arming of abusive regimes. Europe and North  America are fast becoming the IKEA of the arms industry,  supplying parts for human rights abusers to assemble at home,  with the morals not included. It is time for an Arms Trade  Treaty,&quot; said Jeremy Hobbs, director of Oxfam International.</p>
<p>   The report exposes two major loopholes that allow arms  companies to legally circumvent arms regulations, including arms  embargoes:</p>
<p>   You can't sell it whole, but you can sell it in individual  pieces:</p>
<p>   The European Union has an arms embargo against China; the  United States and Canada refuse to sell attack helicopters to  China, yet, China's new Z-10 attack helicopter would not fly  without parts and technology from a UK/Italian company  (AugustaWestland), a Canadian company (Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada), a  US company (Lord Corporation) and a Franco-German company  (Eurocopter). China has previously sold attack helicopters to a  number of countries including Sudan, which is under a full EU  arms embargo and a partial UN arms embargo. The Apache  helicopter, used by Israel in the recent Lebanon crisis, is made  up of over 6,000 parts manufactured worldwide, including in UK,  the Netherlands and Ireland. Under the EU Code of Conduct, these  countries should refuse to export attack helicopters directly to  Israel. </p>
<p>   You can't sell from here, but you can sell from over there:</p>
<p>   In May 2005, Uzbek security forces fired on demonstrators,  killing hundreds of people. The Uzbek military used military Land  Rovers during the massacre, which were made up of 70 percent  British parts. The Land Rover parts were sent &quot;flat pack&quot; to  Turkey, where they were assembled and made into military  vehicles. The vehicles were then supplied to the Uzbek  government. The UK government has no control over the deal  because the vehicles were not assembled and converted into  military vehicles in the UK.  </p>
<p>   &quot;EU arms makers don't have to sacrifice profits for the sake  of principle, instead they can simply subcontract,&quot; said Rebecca  Peters, director of the International Action Network on Small  Arms. &quot;For example, the Austrian gun company Glock is trying to  establish a production plant in Brazil. If that goes ahead, Glock  will be able to circumvent the EU Code of Conduct on Arms Exports  by shipping guns from its Brazilian plant.&quot;</p>
<p>   The report also shows that the technology revolutionizing the  arms industry is often the same as that used in the home and that  it is frequently unregulated. For example, the digital signal  processors used in the latest DVD players can also be found in  target acquisition systems for fighter jet missile systems, yet  when the technology is sold for use in military planes it is not  regulated. </p>
<p>   &quot;Arms trade laws are so out of date that the sales of army  helmets are more regulated than the components assembled into  deadly weapons. What the world needs is an effective  international Arms Trade Treaty that will stop the flow of arms  to those that commit human rights abuses,&quot; said Irene Khan,  secretary general of Amnesty International.</p>
<p>   Facts and figures: </p>
<p>   -- By the end of this year, military spending is estimated to  reach an unprecedented $1,058.9 billion, which is roughly 15  times international aid expenditure. This is higher than the Cold  War record reached in 1987 to 1988 of $1,034 in today's prices. </p>
<p>   -- In 2005, the United States, Russia, the United Kingdom,  France and Germany together accounted for an estimated 82 percent  of all arms transfers. </p>
<p>   -- Brazil, India, Israel, Singapore, South Africa and South  Korea now all have arms companies in the world's top 100.</p>
