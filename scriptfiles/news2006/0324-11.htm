<p>CHARLOTTETOWN, Canada - March 24 - Canada's  annual hunt for harp seal pups starts tomorrow, according to the  IFAW (International Fund for Animal Welfare). </p>
<p>   &quot;By allowing this cruel and unnecessary hunt to continue, the  federal government is disregarding sound science, national and  international public opinion and simple decency. This year, they  are going one step worse by inflicting one of the highest quotas  ever at 335,000 seal pups,&quot; said Olivier Bonnet, IFAW's Canadian  director.</p>
<p>   Canada has allowed nearly a million seals to be killed over  the past three years, in the largest hunt of marine mammals in  the world. This year's government quota is one of the highest  since the hunt began. The hunt occurs annually, in the spring,  when hundreds of thousands of seal pups are killed during a few  days of intense hunting.</p>

<p>   The hunt draws international criticism due to its brutality  and waste. Seals are hunted primarily for their pelts, which are  used in the fashion industry.  </p>
<p>   This is a hunt for seal pups. Last year, according to  statistics provided by the Canadian government, 329,829 seals  were killed, and 98 percent of them were less than three months  old. Experts agree that the size of the hunt coupled with  environmental uncertainty is putting the harp seal population at  significant risk of depletion.</p>
<p>   &quot;This is a cruel hunt for products that nobody needs,&quot; said  Fred O'Regan, IFAW's president and CEO. &quot;Canada is better than  this. It's time for the new Canadian government to shut down the  seal hunt.&quot;</p>
<p>   Each spring the entire Northwest Atlantic harp seal population  migrates to the East Coast of Newfoundland to mate, give birth  and nurse their young. In one of nature's great wildlife  spectacles, thousands of seals are born on the pristine ice floes  off eastern Canada in early March. </p>
<p>   Seal pups may be legally killed as soon as they begin to moult  their fluffy white natal coats, usually at about14 days old. </p>
