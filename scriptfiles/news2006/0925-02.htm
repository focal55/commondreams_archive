<p>WASHINGTON - September 25 - WWF, the global  conservation organization, said today it was deeply saddened at the  loss of life in Saturday's helicopter crash in the mountainous far- east of Nepal.</p>
<p>   &quot;The helicopter has been found, and it appears that there are  no survivors, but we are waiting for final confirmation,&quot; WWF  Director General James Leape said this morning.</p>
<p>   The wreckage of the Shree Air helicopter was found today 1.8  km. (1.15 miles) from Ghunsa village. Rescuers had been looking  for the crash site since the helicopter disappeared shortly after  noon Nepal time (6.00 GMT) on Saturday.</p>
<p>   It was found by a search team who had hiked in on foot.</p>
<p>   &quot;This is a time of profound sadness for all of us at WWF. Our  hearts go out to the families and loved ones of the passengers  and crew at this time of great loss,&quot; said Carter S. Roberts, CEO  of WWF in the United States. In the U.S. and Canada, WWF is known  as World Wildlife Fund.</p>
<p>   Seven WWF staff from its offices in Nepal, the U.K. and the  U.S. were on board, as well as high-ranking government officials,  representatives of other agencies, journalists and Russian crew  members.</p>
<p>   If confirmed, the deaths will amount to the biggest single  loss of life in WWF's 45-year history.</p>
<p>   &quot;The colleagues we have lost had dedicated their lives to  conserving the extraordinary natural resources of Nepal and of  the earth. Their deaths are a huge blow to conservation efforts  in Nepal, and worldwide. They will be greatly missed,&quot; Leape  said.</p>
<p>   &quot;I am humbled by the work and dedication that the seven  amazing conservationists from WWF and our deeply valued partners  brought to their work. They are conservation heroes and will be  sorely missed by all of us,&quot; said Roberts.</p>
<p>   WWF appreciates the cooperation the authorities have given us  and all the efforts of local communities during this difficult  time.</p>
<p>   The helicopter was on its way back from a trip to a  conservation site at Ghunsa, in Kangchenjunga, eastern Nepal,  near the border with India. It was due to land in Taplejung 20  minutes later but failed to arrive.</p>
<p>   An air and land search was quickly begun, but was hampered by  the remote location and poor weather conditions, which reduced  visibility.</p>
<p>   The helicopter was returning from an inauguration ceremony  which saw the Nepalese government turn over the conservation of  the wildlife and habitats surrounding Kangchenjunga -- the  world's third-highest mountain -- to a coalition of local  communities.</p>
<p>   The Kangchenjunga Conservation Area is known for its rich  biodiversity, spectacular scenery and vibrant cultural heritage.  Launched in 1998, it is designed to conserve globally threatened  wildlife species such as the snow leopard and red panda while  supporting the local communities through health services,  informal education and income-generating activities.</p>
