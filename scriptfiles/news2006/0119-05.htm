<p>   DETAILS:</p>
<p>   Common Cause invites the media to join us for a unique and  informative panel discussion Monday at the National Press Club in  Washington, D.C., titled &quot;Restoring Ethics in Washington: How  Congress Can Create an Independent Ethics Commission.&quot;  </p>
<p>   Jack Abramoff is at the heart of the biggest congressional  scandal to hit Washington in decades. Yet in the 18 months since  allegations began surfacing about Abramoff and his activities  with members of Congress, the House and Senate ethics committees  have been silent. Were it not for the efforts of federal  prosecutors and investigative journalists, we may never have  known about efforts by Abramoff and his associates to buy  legislative favors in exchange for campaign contributions and  gifts.  </p>
<p>   And even before the Abramoff scandal broke, it was more than  clear by the inactivity of the House and Senate ethics committees  that there was little enforcement of ethics rules in Congress.   </p>
<p>   We believe an independent ethics commission is a solution to  cleaning up Washington. Some states already have truly  independent ethics commissions with jurisdiction over their state  legislatures. This panel of legislative ethics experts at the  federal and state levels will explore the idea of an independent  ethics commission for Congress and help shape a proposal. </p>
