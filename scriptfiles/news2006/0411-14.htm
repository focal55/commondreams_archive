<p>WASHINGTON - April 11 – Human Rights Campaign President Joe Solmonese sent the following letter today to the Dutch ambassador. The letter was prompted by recent news reports of a vicious and brutal hate crime committed against two American tourists. Those same reports also highlighted a hesitance by Saint Maarten authorities to launch a full and complete investigation.

<p>The text of the letter is below:

<p>April 11, 2006

<p>His Excellency Boudewijn Johannes Van Eenennaam<br>

The Ambassador of the Kingdom of the Netherlands<br>

4200 Linnean Avenue, NW<br>

Washington, D.C. 20008

<p>Dear Mr. Ambassador Van Eenennaam:

<p>Saint Maarten gained the dubious distinction last week of becoming one of the latest places were an anti-gay hate crime has occurred. Two American tourists from New York, Dick Jefferson and Ryan Smith, became the victims of a particularly vicious and brutal attack.

<p>Unfortunately, the gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender community has had to deal with such hate-filled violence terrorizing our community for years. However, even more troubling in this particular case is the apparent lack of attention local authorities paid to the immediate needs of the case.

<p>In an Associated Press story today, Mr. Jefferson faulted Saint Maarten authorities for not being vigilant in pursuing witnesses that could have led to a possible quick arrest. When someone is beaten by three men with tire irons we expect authorities to put their full resources to apprehending the perpetrators.

<p>Saint Maarten has been a popular tourist destination for many gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender Americans for years. This recent news will most certainly give pause to members of our community who are planning any future travels to the area.

<p>Hate crimes are a devastating reality that gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people face all too often. These acts are most certainly used to instill terror throughout an entire community of people.

<p>A failure to conduct a full and complete investigation to apprehend a hate crime perpetrator not only allows prejudice to fester but keeps citizens and tourists at risk. I certainly hope that the government of the Netherlands understands the seriousness of this crime and will take immediate steps to ensure a full and complete investigation.

<p>Sincerely,

<p>Joe Solmonese<br>

President<br>

Human Rights Campaign
