<p>WASHINGTON - February 22 - Hawaii's income tax  burdens for working-poor families are among the highest in the  country, according to a new study from the Center on Budget and  Policy Priorities, which examines the income tax burdens on the  poor in the 42 states that levy income taxes.  A two-parent  family of four in Hawaii with income at the federal poverty line  of $19,961 owes $470 in state income taxes for 2005.  A single- parent family of three in Hawaii with income at the federal  poverty line of $15,577 owes $373.  Those amounts are the  nation's second-highest, after Alabama.</p>
<p>   Working poor families in Hawaii face substantial state income  tax burdens even if their incomes are well below the federal  poverty line. Hawaii's &quot;tax threshold&quot; (the income level at which  families begin owing taxes) for tax year 2005 is $11,500 for a two-parent family of  four and $9,800 for a single-parent family of three.  These  thresholds are the 4th-lowest and 3rd-lowest in the nation,  respectively.  Such taxes can make a big difference to a family  struggling to escape poverty.</p>
<p>   &quot;The federal government has exempted poor working families  from income taxes since the 1980s because both parties agree on  the importance of helping families work their way out of  poverty,&quot; said Jason Levitis, co-author of the report.  &quot;Many  states have improved their income-tax treatment of low-income  families since the early 1990s.  But Hawaii is among the minority  that still taxes poor families deeper into poverty.&quot;</p>
<p>   Leading state legislators and the governor have introduced  proposals that would substantially increase income tax thresholds  and reduce state income taxes paid by low-income families.  An  appendix to the Center's study provides an analysis of three of  these proposals.</p>
<p>   According to the Center's analysis, both the governor's  proposal and a proposed state Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC)  would be sufficient to move Hawaii's thresholds above the poverty  line, and to guarantee tax refunds to families at the poverty  line.  Hawaii's income-tax treatment of low-income families would  go from being substantially worse than that of other states to  being better than that of most other states. A proposal to  increase the standard deduction would also increase the  thresholds substantially but would leave thresholds somewhat  below the poverty line and lower than those in the majority of  other states.</p>
<p>   &quot;Eliminating state income taxes on working families with  poverty-level incomes gives a boost in take-home pay that helps  offset higher child care and transportation costs that families  incur as they strive to become economically self-sufficient,&quot;  said Nicholas Johnson, co-author of the report.  &quot;In other words,  relieving state income taxes on poor families can make a  meaningful contribution toward making work pay.&quot;</p>

<p>   Note to editors: The Center on Budget will host a Hawaii- specific media conference call briefing to discuss the findings  for Hawaii and proposals to reduce state income taxes paid by  low-income families at 11:30 a.m. (HT) (4:30 p.m. (ET)) on  Wednesday, February 22nd.</p>
