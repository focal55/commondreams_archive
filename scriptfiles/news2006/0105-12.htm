<p>WASHINGTON - January 5 - An analysis released  today by the Institute for America's Future finds that retail  behemoth Wal-Mart Inc. sucked more than $20 billion out of local  economies across America this holiday season. </p>
<p>   Despite slower-than-projected revenue growth for November and  December, Wal-Mart still brought in a record $66 billion for the  holiday season - more than five times the revenue of its next- largest competitor.  Looking more closely, Wal-Mart's siphoning  means a loss of billions in wages and benefits paid, lost  purchases of inventory, supplies and services from other local  businesses, lost tax revenue to local government and lost  contributions to local charities.</p>
<p>   &quot;America, as we know it, can't afford Wal-Mart,&quot; said Robert  Borosage, president of the Institute for America's Future.  &quot;People across America are starting to realize the stark reality:  Wal-Mart's triumph is the defeat of middle-class America. If Wal- Mart sets the pace, Americans will pay the price, in declining  wages, rising health care costs, longer hours, worsening  workplace conditions and rising personal taxes to offset soaring  corporate subsidies. </p>
<p>   The Institute for America's Future analysis combines today's  December retail sales report from Wal-Mart to its previously  reported November sales to define the company's overall holiday  sales. The report applies that holiday sales total to research  done by the Institute for Local Self-Reliance to calculate the  cost to local communities. </p>
<p>   According to a report by the Institute for Local Self- Reliance, $100 spent in locally owned businesses provides the  town and surrounding area $44.60, while large retail chains only  give back $14.10 to local communities, mainly in the form of  wages and service.  Therefore, local communities lose at least  $30.50 for every $100 spent at Wal-Mart.</p>
<p>   For this holiday season, Wal-Mart's record-breaking sales mean  staggering losses for Main Street, U.S.A.: $20.3 billion.  Had  that $66 billion been spent at locally owned businesses, it would  have generated some $29.7 billion for local communities.   However, thanks to Wal-Mart, that $66 billion translates to only  $9.4 billion going into local economies. </p>
