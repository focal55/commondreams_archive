<p>WASHINGTON - January 24 - Publication of the Council of Europe's interim report on the issue of extraordinary renditions and secret detention centres in Europe is a step towards uncovering the truth about the extent to which US agents are carrying out renditions and related practices in Europe. However, it makes clear that serious questions still need to be answered by a number of European governments.

<p>The report recognizes that there is "a great deal of coherent, convergent evidence pointing to the existence of a system of 'relocation' or 'outsourcing' of torture." What is needed now is the cooperation of all countries to ensure that they actively look at what is happening within their territory, which may facilitate torture and take appropriate action. 

<p>"European countries have the duty to fully collaborate in the investigations of gross human rights violations committed in their own territory. Not cooperating with those investigations is tantamount to collaborating with the abuses," said Claudio Cordone, Amnesty International's Senior Director of Regional Programmes.

<p>Amnesty International supports the call of Dick Marty, the Council of Europe's Parliamentary Assembly Rapporteur, for a full committee of inquiry, with extensive investigatory powers.

<p>"The allegations that secret detention centres have existed in Europe, as Dick Marty has pointed out, come from varied and credible sources. Not even the US government has denied their existence. The issue now is what will be done about it," said Claudio Cordone.

<p>Amnesty International is campaigning to stop torture and ill-treatment in the "war on terror".
