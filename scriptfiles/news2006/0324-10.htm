<p>WASHINGTON - March 24 - The Rhode Island  Department of Education has banned from public schools an  abstinence-only-until-marriage program found to violate students'  rights, embrace sexist stereotypes, isolate GLBT youth, and, in  accompanying materials, promulgate religious views.</p>
<p>   &quot;We've known for some time that abstinence-only is bad  science, bad policy, and a blatant violation of medical ethics  and basic human rights,&quot; said James Wagoner, president of  Advocates for Youth.  &quot;And as more people find out what is being  taught and what is being censored in these ineffective programs,  more and more of these 'stay pure or we don't care about you'  programs will be banned from public schools.&quot;</p>

<p>   A letter sent last week by Education Commissioner Peter  McWalters issued a directive to schools not to use the program or  accompanying materials, and also revealed that the classes taught  by Heritage of Rhode Island were never approved by state  authorities.  The Commissioner announced his office would create  a panel to review the HIV/AIDS curricula of every school district  in the state.</p>
<p>   &quot;Enough is enough. For too long these abstinence-only programs  have operated without a hint of oversight,&quot; said Wagoner.  &quot;At  least at the state level, this trend is changing, and public  health officials couldn't be more pleased.&quot;</p>
<p>   Recently, the Society for Adolescent Medicine, in one of the  most exhaustive reviews to date of government-funded abstinence- only programs like that of Heritage of Rhode Island, rejected  current administration policy that promotes abstinence as the  only sexual health prevention strategy for young people.</p>
<p>   Any decision to continue using abstinence-only programs is  even more difficult to defend, given that:</p>
<p>   -- Curricula used by a majority of abstinence-only-until- marriage programs provide false and misleading information,  according to the House of Representatives' Committee on  Government Reform - Minority Staff; </p>

<p>   -- State evaluations from across the country show these  programs don't work to delay sexual initiation; </p>
<p>   -- The nation's most trusted medical organizations, such as  the American Medical Association (AMA), the American Academy of  Pediatrics (AAP) and the Institute of Medicine (IOM), all support  comprehensive sex education. </p>
<p>   &quot;Now it's time for Congress to declare an immediate moratorium  on federal funding for these programs. It is a national scandal  that we have already spent over $1.1 billion of taxpayers'  dollars on programs that don't work and that censor vital public  health information for young people. It is time to restore sanity  and common sense to our public health policy,&quot; concluded Wagoner.
