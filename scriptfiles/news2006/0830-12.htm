<p>NEW ORLEANS - August 30 - Buzz Hargrove, president of the Canadian Auto Workers Union, visited homes in the Lower 9<sup>th</sup> Ward Tuesday that his union members are rehabilitating along with the local neighborhood group, ACORN (Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now).
</p>
<p>CAW members have completed renovations of a home on Alvar Street. For the next two months, different teams of auto workers will come to New Orleans to help rebuild five homes. 
</p>
<p>Hargrove stood outside a historic home on Deslonde Avenue Tuesday with ACORN chief organizer Wade Rathke. The CAW is expected to begin to work soon on the house in the historic Holy Cross neighborhood. 
</p>
<p>“We come here to draw attention to what has not happened one year after the storm,’’ said Hargrove. "It's important for all of us to contribute to the rebuilding of New Orleans. 
</p>
<p> “The United States may be the wealthiest country in the world, but that doesn’t mean all the wealth is shared,’’ Hargrove said.</p>
