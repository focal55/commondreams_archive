<p>SILVER SPRING, Maryland - August 9 - The victory of  insurgent candidate Ned Lamont over staunchly pro-war Sen. Joe  Lieberman in yesterday's Connecticut primary demonstrates the  intense voter dissatisfaction with the war in Iraq - and the  power of the pro-peace vote in this year's mid-term elections.  Peace Action, the nation's largest grassroots peace organization  (which endorsed Lamont), will mobilize that power this fall  through its nationwide &quot;Peace Voter 2006&quot; campaign.</p>
<p>   Peace Voter 2006 is a non-partisan, grassroots campaign  designed to let voters know where candidates stand on a number of  key foreign and domestic policy issues, including the withdrawal  of troops from Iraq, the resumption of U.S. nuclear weapons  testing, potential military intervention in Iran, federal budget  priorities and the military's recruitment of young Americans.</p>

<p>   &quot;Both Democrats and Republicans need to realize the American  public is not looking for politicians who posture about being  &quot;strong&quot; or &quot;tough&quot; on foreign affairs,&quot; said Kevin Martin,  Executive Director of Peace Action. &quot;The electorate is looking  for candidates who have clear ideas about solving our nation's  problems, and the no. 1 problem to address is our government's  disastrous military occupation of Iraq, which is now the defining  issue of our time.&quot; Martin noted that Ned Lamont's strong belief  in employing international cooperation over unilateral military  action, as well as his call to re-prioritize domestic needs such  as health care for all Americans, also helped him win in  Connecticut - and that such a message will doubtless appeal to  voters across the country.</p>
<p>   The primary vehicle for Peace Voter 2006 will be the Peace  Voter Guide, which will be distributed to 2.5 - 3 million voters  nationwide. An example of the Peace Voter Guide, along with other  supporting materials such as the candidate questionnaire (from  which candidate positions are taken), can be found at  <a href="http://releases.usnewswire.com/redir.asp?ReleaseID=70508&Link=http://www.peacevoter.org">http://www.peacevoter.org</a></p>

<p>   Peace Action, a national organization with affiliates and  chapters across the country, will be organizing Peace Voter  campaigns in more than 40 key House and Senate races this fall,  including highly competitive races in Pennsylvania, Michigan, New  Jersey, California, Maryland, Ohio, Connecticut and New York. (A  list of specific races will be posted in early September.)</p>
<p>   The Peace Voter campaign is also aligned with the Peace Voter  Pledge, a campaign enabling individual voters to sign a pledge to  only support candidates who are calling for an end to the U.S.  occupation of Iraq. A copy of this pledge, which has so far been  signed by over 85,000 people nationally, can also be found at  <a href="http://releases.usnewswire.com/redir.asp?ReleaseID=70508&Link=http://www.peacevoter.org">http://www.peacevoter.org</a></p>
