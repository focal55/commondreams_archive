<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p><i>Sierra Club Statement by 
Dan Becker, Director, Global Warming Program</i>
<p>WASHINGTON - June 29 - Yesterday, Bill Ford announced in an email to Ford Motor Company employees that Ford was walking away from its promise to produce 250,000 hybrid vehicles annually by the end of the decade.  Instead, as Ford also announced yesterday in a letter with GM and DaimlerChrysler to Congress, it intends to focus on doubling its production of flexfuel vehicles. 
<p>“We were pleased to applaud Ford when it made a promise to build 250,000 hybrid vehicles annually by 2010.  Today we are appalled that Ford is abrogating this promise.  Ford is rapidly becoming the automaker that cried wolf.  In 2000, Ford promised to increase the fuel economy of its SUVs by 25% over five years; it walked away from that promise in 2003.  By swapping out more clean and efficient hybrids for more flexfuel vehicles, Ford is engaging in a classic bait and switch.  Even the Bush administration admits that flexfuels run on regular gasoline 99% of the time, since E85 is only available at an infinitesimal .003% of the nation’s gas stations.  Instead of taking concrete steps to save consumers money at the pump by giving them efficient hybrids, Ford is saddling consumers with the same gas guzzlers that will run on the same gasoline they have for the past 100 years.   

<p>“Ford already has the least efficient fleet of the Big 6 automakers and it can and should do better than simply using clever marketing to disguise its exploitation of the SUV-sized flexfuel vehicle loophole in the CAFE law.  This loophole allows Ford and other automakers to make more gas guzzlers than the already weak CAFE law would allow if they simply make a certain number of flexfuel vehicles—even though the vast majority of these vehicles never actually run on E85. 

<p>“I am particularly disappointed that Bill Ford himself delivered this unfortunate news.  He and his company have repeatedly claimed—using multi-million dollar ad campaigns—to be environmental champions that were working toward cleaner and more environmentally sound choices for consumers.  We now know that Ford Motor Company cannot be relied upon to tell the truth or even to compete effectively with the more efficient fleets of foreign competitors like Honda and Toyota.  It is also becoming clear that Bill Ford himself is either unable or unwilling to live up to his own commitments to the environment.
