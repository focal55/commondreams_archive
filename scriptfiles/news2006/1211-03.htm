<p>WASHINGTON - December 11 - Paparazzi-hating  Hollywood stars have nothing on a camera-averse young tiger in  central Sumatra that recently went on a 10-day spree of  destruction that left three WWF's camera traps in pieces in the  jungle. In each case, the film inside was spared and revealed  that the same culprit was responsible for all three incidents.  Scientists believe the camera's flash upset the tiger.</p>
<p>   Infrared-triggered camera traps take photos of animals moving  past that trigger their temperature-sensitive sensors and are  used to gather photographs of wildlife and identify tigers in an  area. In less than 10 days, a far-ranging tiger attacked and  destroyed three of the cameras WWF had stationed in the jungle  about seven miles apart.</p>
<p>   &quot;Fortunately, the photographic evidence survived,&quot; said  Sunarto, lead tiger researcher for WWF in the central Sumatran  province of Riau, Indonesia. &quot;We developed the film and were able  to identify the same individual in each case -- a young tiger  that clearly doesn't like having his picture taken. The flash  from the camera apparently set him off each time he passed by a  camera and he walked over to it and ripped it to pieces with his  teeth.&quot;</p>
<p>   Each tiger's stripe pattern is unique, so photos from camera  traps allow WWF scientists to identify individuals in the jungle  and help determine an accurate population estimate. The film in  all three incidents revealed a tiger with the same stripe  pattern. </p>
<p>   &quot;We've had camera traps destroyed before by tigers and other  wildlife and we've had camera traps stolen by illegal loggers and  poachers,&quot; Sunarto said. &quot;But this is the first time we've been  able to identify a culprit.  Young tigers are curious and  adventurous. I've warned our team to be careful working in this  area with such a tiger around.&quot;</p>
<p>   The series of attacks took place in the Tesso Nilo-Bukit  Tigapuluh Conservation Landscape, inside the Kerumutan Wildlife  Reserve, which is surrounded by land about to be cleared by pulp  and paper companies. Conducting research in the remote area is  difficult and WWF's tiger teams spent weeks trekking deep into  the interior of the reserve to set up the camera traps. </p>
<p>   &quot;In our interviews with communities and local authorities,  only a few people said they had ever seen signs of tigers in  Kerumutan,&quot; said Cobar Hutajulu, a member of WWF's tiger team in  Riau. &quot;But these photos are evidence of healthy tigers in the  area. Unfortunately, we also found a lot of evidence of illegal  logging in the area.&quot; </p>
<p>   Central Sumatra's tiger and elephant habitat has declined  drastically in the past two decades, with many animals now  isolated from each other in small pockets of forest. WWF is  working to stop further clearing of natural forest in the area  and to reconnect isolated fragments of habitat via wooded  wildlife corridors. </p>
<p>   There are estimated to be fewer than 500 Sumatran tigers left  in the wild. </p>
