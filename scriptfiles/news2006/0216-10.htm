<p>NEW YORK - February 16 - Today The Center for Constitutional Rights (CCR) applauded the U.N. Special Rapporteurs' conclusion in an investigative report that the U.S. must shut down Guantánamo. In the report, five U.N. experts also called on the U.S. to "refrain from any practice amounting to torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment."

 

<p>Barbara J. Olshansky, Deputy Legal Director of the New York-based Center which represents hundreds of men being held in Guantánamo, said: "The significance of this UN report cannot be overstated; it represents the findings of the world's top legal experts on human rights and the laws of war.  The conclusions of the five Special Rapporteurs represent the international consensus that the U.S. is violating nearly every rule of international law concerning the seizure, detention, and treatment of people during wartime and peacetime" Olshansky, who has been litigating on behalf of Guantánamo detainees from the time of the establishment of the Guantánamo camps, added: "The Rapporteurs' report confirms what the Center has been saying for a long time:  that the U.S. arbitrarily seized people from countries far from any battlefield who were not involved in any war or terrorist activities and placed them in Guantánamo; that these people have been denied all due process and been held without recourse to any  court to hear a challenge to their detention; and that they have been tortured and mistreated.  It is far past the time for the U.S. to return its democratic principles of justice and fairness and humanity."

 

<p>Although the U.S. government has tried to undermine the validity of the report by emphasizing that the U.N. representatives have never visited the naval base at Guantánamo, the government has neglected to acknowledge that they have repeatedly denied U.N. representatives access to the prisoner population.  The government has sought to orchestrate the conditions under which the U.N. can visit the base, essentially offering a guided tour and impeding any opportunity for independent inquiry into the practices and procedures in effect there.  Given these constraints, the U.N. representatives who authored this report refused an invitation to Guantánamo, specifically citing their unwillingness to engage in a visit that does not include access to the detainees.
