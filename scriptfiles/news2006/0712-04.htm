<p>MOGADISHU, Somalia - July 12 - Mogadishu hospitals supported by the ICRC treated over 380 casualties following heavy fighting in Somalia's capital at the beginning of this week. Most had gunshot wounds. Eleven of the 151 patients admitted to Medina hospital subsequently died from their injuries, while more than 220 people are being treated at the temporary Benadir Hospital. Both hospitals are located in Mogadishu South, where the clashes took place.


<p>Fire from heavy weapons hit Medina Hospital three times, damaging the laundry and parts of the male ward but without injuring any patients. For two days, staff were unable to reach the hospital due to the fighting, but personnel already on site continued to treat patients.

<p>Medina Hospital had to increase its capacity to cope with the large number of new arrivals. Some patients were released early, and additional sleeping space was created in the hallways. The ICRC regularly supplies the hospital with surgical equipment and medicines and trains the medical staff, enabling the hospital to respond quickly to any emergency. "The medical staff at Medina and other hospitals in Mogadishu are extremely motivated. They’re willing to work around the clock if necessary," says Suzanne Grognuz, ICRC health delegate responsible for the organization’s assistance to hospitals in Mogadishu.

<p>Medina Hospital is a full-service community hospital and the ICRC has been providing support since 2000. Since May 2006, the ICRC has also been providing Benadir Hospital with surgical equipment, dressing kits and medicines. In Mogadishu North, the ICRC is supporting Keysaney Hospital, which is run by the Somali Red Crescent Society.

<p>The ICRC calls on all groups and individuals to prevent suffering among a defenceless population and to protect the life and the dignity of those not taking part in the fighting.
