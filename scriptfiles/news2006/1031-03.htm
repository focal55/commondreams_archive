<p>WASHINGTON - October 31 - The Nature Conservancy,  World Wildlife Foundation (WWF) and Stanford University today  announced the launch of an innovative partnership that aims to  change the way governments and policy makers think about nature  worldwide.</p>
<p>   The program, called the Natural Capital Project, is an  unprecedented effort to calculate the economic and other benefits  nature provides to people -- so-called &quot;ecosystem services&quot; such  as clean water, flood control and climate regulation. By  answering the question, &quot;What is nature worth to people?&quot; the  Natural Capital Project highlights the many ways in which the  world's forests, grasslands, arid lands, freshwater systems and  oceans, support their daily lives.</p>
<p>   &quot;This exciting project brings together the expertise of  leading field conservationists and a world-class university,&quot;  said Steve McCormick, president and CEO of The Nature  Conservancy. &quot;Recognizing that ecosystems should be protected for  their intrinsic values as well as their economic values will help  us prioritize the conservation of the world's natural systems.  This, in turn, can help improve the quality of life for people  throughout the world.&quot;</p>
<p>   Ecosystem services can include everything from soil fertility  to clean air to pest control. These services are essential to  human health. As the world's natural resources are depleted  through unsustainable land-use practices, important ecosystem  services are being lost at an alarming rate. The impact is  greatest felt by the world's poorest people, who cannot afford to  buy or replace the resources they are losing from nature.</p>
<p>   Two groundbreaking scientific papers, authored by scientists  from Natural Capital Project partner organizations, were  published in PLoS Biology today. These papers are the first to  show how ecosystem services can influence the outcomes of  conservation planning efforts. Research led by Kai Chan at  University of British Columbia and Rebecca Shaw of The Nature  Conservancy suggests that in California biodiversity conservation  is highly compatible with the protection of ecosystem services  upon which Californians depend and should be included in  systematic conservation planning. And research led by Robin  Naidoo at WWF revealed that based on a study of a landscape in  Paraguay the economic benefits of conserving forests exceed the  benefits of farming the same land in many areas. Chan's paper can  be found at <a href="http://releases.usnewswire.com/redir.asp?ReleaseID=75352&Link=http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.0040379">http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.0040379</a> and  Naidoo's paper can be found at  <a href="http://releases.usnewswire.com/redir.asp?ReleaseID=75352&Link=http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.0040360">http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.0040360</a>.</p>
<p>   &quot;Learning to map the economic values of nature will give us  the information we need to conserve ecosystems for the benefit of  biodiversity and people. That's what these papers and the Natural  Capital Project, are about,&quot; said Taylor Ricketts, director of  WWF's Conservation Science Program and co-author of one of the  papers. &quot;Our early results indicate that the benefits of  conservation can far outweigh costs and that if land owners could  capture the value of ecosystem services, like carbon storage,  conservation can be a profitable use of land.&quot;</p>
<p>   The Natural Capital Project will begin working with local  partners in three pilot areas -- the Eastern Arc Mountains of  Tanzania, the upper Yangtze River Basin in China and the Sierra  Nevada region in California -- to assess the value of the  ecosystem services and to then help incorporate those values into  policies and resource decisions.</p>
