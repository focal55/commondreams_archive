<p>   Willie Nelson, Neil Young and John Mellencamp organized the  first Farm Aid concert in 1985 to raise awareness about the loss  of family farms and to raise funds to keep farm families on their  land. Dave Matthews joined the Farm Aid Board of Directors in  2001. Farm Aid raises awareness about the critical role of family  farms and has raised more than $29 million to build and  strengthen family farm food production. Between 1985 and 2005, 80  percent of Farm Aid's total expenditures was spent on programs to  benefit family farmers, exceeding charity watchdog standards.  Through public education, program activities and grants, Farm Aid  promotes food from family farms and sustainable agriculture,  fights factory farms, advocates for fair farm prices and provides  disaster assistance and credit counseling to farm families.</p>
