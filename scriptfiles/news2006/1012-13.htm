<p>WASHINGTON - October 12 - The typical worker's earnings have increased little over  the last six years despite apparently rapid productivity growth,  according to a report by the Center for Economic and Policy Research.  &quot;<em>A Note on Distribution and Growth,</em>&quot; by economist Dean  Baker, provides a quick examination of key measurement issues to assess  the extent to which they can explain this gap. <br />
  <br />
To read the paper, click <a href="http://www.cepr.net/publications/distribution_2006_10.pdf">here</a>.<br>
<br>
The report shows that there has been little change in the  distribution between labor and capital in the current business cycle.  While the profit share of income is up from its 2000 level, it is just  now reaching the peaks it hit in 1997 (the profit peak of the last  business cycle). <br />
<br />
The report also examines the gap between productivity growth and  &quot;usable&quot; productivity growth, which is due to the growing gap  between gross and net output and the gap between the CPI and implicit  price deflator used for measuring output. As a result of this growing  gap, the rate of usable productivity growth is still more than 0.7  percentage points lower than in the 1960s golden age.</p>
