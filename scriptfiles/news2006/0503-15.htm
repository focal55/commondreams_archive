<p>SAN FRANCISCO  - May 3 -   Fair Trade is catching on everywhere, because it gives consumers a way to support businesses that provide a good environment for the workers who make our clothing, coffee, jewelry, and crafts. The great items featured below are Fair Trade certified, guaranteeing that their producers earn a fair price, and thus a decent living. Fair Trade also ensures that products aren't made using forced or exploitative child labor, and it promoted production techniques that won't harm the environment. Purchasing Fair Trade lets you do a good deed for the world when you're shopping for items that make you look great!
<p>
Global Exchange has four retail Fair Trade Stores: an <a href="http://www.globalexchangestore.org">Online Store</a> and three brick & mortar locations (in San Francisco, Portland, and Berkeley). The following are a few of our favorite new Fair Trade items for summer:
