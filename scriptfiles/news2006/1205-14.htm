<p>WASHINGTON - December 5 - Cindy Sheehan and CODEPINK’s 
        Medea Benjamin Say Charges Should be Dropped and Ambassador John Bolton 
        Should Apologize
<p><strong>When: December 4-December 8<br />
        Where: New York City Criminal Court, 100 Centre Street, Room 535</strong></p>
      <p>On December 4, the same day that UN Ambassador John Bolton announced 
        his resignation, the trial began of 4 women arrested at the US Mission 
        to the UN. On March 6, 2006, in celebration of International Women’s 
        Day, the women’s peace group <font color="#ff0099">CODEPINK</font> 
        had collected 72,000 signatures on a petition entitled Women Say No to 
        War and about 50 women attempted to deliver the petition to the office 
        of John Bolton. Instead, the group was stopped by the New York City police 
        and four of the leaders were arrested and charged with trespassing, disorderly 
        conduct, resisting arrest and obstructing government administration. The 
        trial began on Monday, December 4 in the New York City Criminal Court 
        and will continue until Friday, December 8. The four women charged are 
        “peace mom” Cindy Sheehan, <font color="#ff0099">CODEPINK</font> 
        cofounder Medea Benjamin, Episcopal priest Patti Ackerman and Missy Beattie 
        of Gold Star Families for Peace.</p>
      <p>“We were a peaceful group of women who simply wanted to give our 
        petition to a representative of the US Mission headed by John Bolton,” 
        said <font color="#ff0099">CODEPINK</font> cofounder Medea Benjamin. “But 
        in classic Bolton-style diplomacy, instead of taking our petition and 
        thanking us for our efforts, the UN Mission called the police to arrest 
        us. It’s outrageous.”</p>
      <p>Cindy Sheehan, whose son Casey was killed in Iraq, was hurt by the police 
        as they dragged her across the concrete pavement. “It’s terrible 
        that women working for peace and representing the sentiments of the majority 
        of people in this country—and the world—should be treated like 
        dangerous criminals. Instead of being on trial, we should get an apology 
        from Mr. Bolton before he leaves office.”</p>
      <p><em><strong>Attorney Robert Gottlieb, one of the lawyers for the defendants, 
can be reached at 212-566-7766.</strong></em><!-- #EndEditable -->
