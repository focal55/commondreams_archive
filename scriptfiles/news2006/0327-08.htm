<p> SPRINGFIELD, Illinois - March 27 - The following  was released today by the Institute for America's Future:</p>
<p>   President Bush's prescription drug plan will cost Illinois  taxpayers and beneficiaries $32 billion over the next decade,  according to a report by the Institute for America's Future. The  report outlines the consequences of specific provisions inserted  at the request of pharmaceutical and HMO interests in the  prescription drug law known as Medicare Part D. A coalition of  groups called Americans United released the report today and  launched its statewide campaign to fix the president's Medicare  Part D disaster at a news conference in Chicago.</p>
<p>   Americans United -- the group which defeated the president's  campaign to privatize Social Security last year -- has turned its  guns on Bush's flawed prescription drug plan. The group announced  last week that it is launching a national campaign, "The Campaign  to Fix the Bush Part D Disaster," in 22 states and the District  of Columbia. The announcement came as President  Bush campaigned to save his troubled drug program for seniors  that is the subject of a fierce election-year debate. The  president's tour came as thousands of Medicare recipients have  had trouble with the plan.</p>
<p>   Institute for America's Future co-director Roger Hickey said  the president's plan costs taxpayers because it prohibits  Medicare from negotiating with drug companies to get lower prices  for seniors and denies coverage to millions of seniors who will  still pay monthly premiums this fall.</p>
<p>   "The simplest way to reduce the cost of prescription drugs  would've been to require Medicare to negotiate lower prices from  drug companies like the Veterans Administration does for veterans  -- and by allowing seniors to choose their drug plan directly  from Medicare, instead of from a private insurance company," said  Hickey. "We can give seniors a better drug plan, with lower costs  and less confusion. Part D was written by and for the drug  companies, not seniors -- it shows how corruption in Congress  hurts average people."</p>
<p>   Today's report shows that the primary source of waste in the  drug plan is the decision, dictated by drug and insurance  industry lobbyists, to provide coverage through private providers  and to prohibit Medicare from using its leverage as a bulk buyer  to negotiate lower prices.</p>
