<p>VIENNA - February 3 - The International Atomic Energy 
Agency's inevitable decision to report Iran to the Security Council will 
seriously increase the risk of further escalating conflict in the 
region, Greenpeace said today.

<p>"Reporting Iran to the UN Security Council will be  a lose-lose outcome 
for the international community" said Greenpeace nuclear analyst William 
Peden. "Board members supporting the EU-3 draft resolution will be 
effectively shooting themselves in the foot. 

<p>"There will be no winners in this dispute. As Iran made quite clear 
today they will have no choice but to severely restrict inspections and 
no longer comply with requests to reveal information above and beyond 
what is legally required under existing treaty obligations.  All 
diplomatic initiatives will also be dead in the water escalating further 
tensions on all sides. It is clear that heightened and mismanaged 
distrust on both sides will solve nothing.

<p>"A decision to report Iran is premature - there were hopes that 
negotiations and other diplomatic efforts could still succeed and where 
there remains hope one should not close the door. Regrettably,  the 
majority of the IAEA Board's intentions do just that," said Peden.

<p>Greenpeace is opposed to any nation acquiring nuclear technology and 
nuclear weapons, including Iran. It believes that the current crisis is 
borne out of the clear contradiction in the nuclear Non-Proliferation 
Treaty that obliges signatories to achieve a world free of nuclear 
weapons whilst at the same time encouraging their access to nuclear 
technology that can be diverted to produce those weapons.

 <p>"The real solution to this crisis is a Nuclear Free Zone in the Middle 
East," said Peden. "It is a vital first step towards removing all 
nuclear proliferation risks in the region, as well as providing the 
essential security guarantees from nuclear weapons states outside the 
region. If we don't seriously contemplate this option then the world 
will, as UN Secretary General Kofi Annan pointed out yesterday, lurch 
from nuclear crisis to nuclear crisis," Peden concluded.

<p>Greenpeace is an independent campaigning organisation that uses 
non-violent creative confrontation to expose global environmental 
problems to force solutions that are essential to a green and peaceful 
future.
