<p>NEW YORK  - May 15 - HIV activists demanded today that the New York State Department of 
Health stop illegally collecting medical information on people with HIV and stop 
its illegal end run around New York law requiring informed consent for HIV 
testing.
<P>The HIV Law Project, the New York Civil Liberties Union, the American Civil 
Liberties Union and South Brooklyn Legal Services presented the demand in a 
letter that the organizations sent to the New York Department of Health. The 
letter threatens the Department of Health with a lawsuit unless it changes the 
policies.</P>
<P>&#8220;The state clearly has a responsibility to protect against the spread of HIV, 
but that doesn&#8217;t put it above the law,&#8221; said Cynthia Knox, Deputy Executive 
Director of the HIV Law Project. &#8220;The Department of Health has used the false 
threat of an emergency to undercut laws that were put in place to protect 
medical privacy and allow people to make informed decisions about their 
treatment.&#8221;</P>
<P>According to the letter, since the Department of Health announced that it had 
identified a so-called &#8220;super bug&#8221; infection on February 12, 2005, it has 
repeatedly overstepped its authority by requiring mandatory reporting of 
individual medical data regarding HIV care and treatment to the Department of 
Health.&nbsp; This change is in violation of state law, which guarantees greater 
medical privacy.&nbsp; Rather than permitting public debate about whether 
mandatory reporting of this data will actually help patients or aid in 
preventing the spread of the disease, the state has illegally sidestepped the 
required rulemaking process by repeatedly reissuing on an &#8220;emergency&#8221; basis 
these regulations requiring the reporting of private medical information well 
beyond what the law authorizes.&nbsp; </P>
<P>In addition, the state has gutted important laws mandating that patients be 
tested only after giving informed consent, both by removing the requirement that 
test administrators instruct patients of their rights when they ask for consent 
and by significantly changing the consent form. While the original form made it 
clear that the patient was consenting to a single HIV test, the new form tries 
to serve as a &#8220;one time for all time&#8221; consent that would authorize all 
subsequent HIV-related testing without any further notice to the patient. </P>
<P>More than two months after the Department announced that it had identified a 
so-called &#8220;super bug&#8221; infection, it filed a notice with the state on April 25, 
2005, claiming that emergency circumstances called for changes in public health 
policy.&nbsp; Since it initially asked for the emergency policy changes, the 
Department has extended the emergency regulations four times:&nbsp; July 21, 
2005, October 19, 2005, January 17, 2006, and April 18, 2006.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
</P>
<P>&#8220;Even if the &#8216;super bug&#8217; scare had warranted the initial emergency 
regulations, there has been plenty of time to hold an open debate on the merits 
of the changes, and that hasn&#8217;t happened,&#8221; said Elisabeth Benjamin, Reproductive 
Rights Project Director of the New York Civil Liberties Union.&nbsp; &#8220;The 
Department is playing fast and loose with the law to illegally collect medical 
information and keep people in the dark about their medical treatment.&nbsp; HIV 
is still a very scary disease.&nbsp; People deserve education and counseling to 
help them cope with such a life changing diagnosis.&#8221;</P>
<P>While the emergency policies have been in effect, New York City Health 
Commissioner Thomas Frieden has been advocating for permanent changes in New 
York law, claiming that the informed consent requirements discourage people from 
getting testing. Frieden claims that the changes are necessary because of the 
high percentage of people who don&#8217;t know their HIV status, yet he offers only 
anecdotal evidence that written informed consent and counseling are the real 
barriers that prevent people from getting tested.&nbsp; </P>
<P>HIV advocates agree that the increased prevalence of HIV in communities of 
color is of great concern. However, they say, it is wrong to strip individuals 
who have too often received substandard health care at the hands of both public 
and private agencies &#8211; particularly people of color and people with lower 
incomes and people with limited English proficiency &#8211; of their ability to 
receive HIV education and to make informed decisions about the tests performed 
on them.</P>
<P>&#8220;Twenty-five years into this epidemic, people with HIV/AIDS continue to be 
fired from their jobs, kicked out of their homes and refused medical treatment,&#8221; 
said Sharon McGowan, a staff attorney with the ACLU AIDS Project.&nbsp; &#8220;If the 
government wants to do something to get people tested, it should improve access 
to quality health care and make efforts to end the discrimination, not take away 
their ability to make educated decisions.&#8221;&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>Just last month, Public Advocate Betsy Gotbaum released a survey finding 
gross inadequacies at the city&#8217;s ten clinics that treat sexually transmitted 
diseases including HIV.&nbsp; The survey found that four of the clinics were 
unable to assist Spanish-speaking callers, services were not available at all at 
the East Harlem clinic, and rapid HIV testing was unavailable at two of the 
clinics. Additional information about the survey is available at: <A class=noline_blue href="http://pubadvocate.nyc.gov/news/STDReport42806.html">http://pubadvocate.nyc.gov/news/STDReport42806.html</A>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

flyer further explaining why Commissioner Frieden&#8217;s proposed policy changes are 
wrong is available at: <A class=noline_blue href="http://www.aclu.org/images/asset_upload_file662_24735.pdf">www.aclu.org/images/asset_upload_file662_24735.pdf</A>.</P><!-- #EndEditable -->
