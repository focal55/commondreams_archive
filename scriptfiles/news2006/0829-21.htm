<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->WASHINGTON - August 29 - A new report on the “Cost of Iraq” will be released on Wednesday, August 30, in twenty-five cities by members of MoveOn.org Political Action.  The report will analyze the cost of the Iraq War by Congressional district.

 

<p>Since the Iraq war began, the Republican-led Congress has spent more than $300 Billion on President Bush’s failed policy. $18 billion has been awarded to Halliburton, much of which was in “no bid” contracts and $9 billion is missing. 

 

<p>“Most Americans agree President Bush’s Iraq policy is a fiasco. But Congress keeps rubber-stamping Bush’s wasteful spending,” said Tom Matzzie, Washington Director of MoveOn Political Action. “By voting to spend $300 billion on the fiasco in Iraq, Republicans in Congress have short-changed education, health care, job creation, and tough homeland security,” he added. 

 

<p>The estimate is based on two reports: the “Cost of War” by the National Priorities Project http://costofwar.com/numbers.html, which looks at Congressional appropriations and Congressional Research Service (CRS) studies.


<p>At the events, local MoveOn members holding giant red hands and signs accusing their representative of being “caught red-handed” will talk about money from their district that has been wasted.

 

<p>“George Bush's war has cost the resident of Saratoga Springs, New York more than $962 million,” said Roger Wyatt, a local MoveOn member. “It is outrageous that Representative Sweeney has continued to support wasting our hard-earned dollars on Bush's fiasco in Iraq instead of spending that money here at home where we really need it.” Wyatt concluded.

 

<p>The national report will be available on Wednesday at <a href="http://www.moveon.org">www.political.moveon.org/costofiraq</a>.
