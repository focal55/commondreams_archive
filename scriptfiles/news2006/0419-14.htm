<p>NEW YORK / WASHINGTON - April 19 - Jackie Guerra, the first Latina to star in a network sitcom (WB’s “First Time Out”), will host Workin’ It, a new program on Air America Radio focusing on working life in America.  The show premiere will air Saturday, April 22, 2 p.m.-3 p.m., on WLIB-1190AM in New York City, WWRC-1260AM in Washington, DC, and on Channel XM Satellite Radio Channel 167.

 

<p>“Workin’ It is all about what’s happening to American workers,” said Guerra, a stand-up comic, actress, and author whose first job after college was as a Los Angeles organizer for the Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees International Union (HERE).  “From low-wage jobs to immigration, we’re going to break down hot topics in the news and show how these issues impact our daily lives. I don’t think anything exists on the air from that perspective.”

 

<p>Produced in partnership with workers’ rights advocacy group, American Rights at Work (http://www.americanrightsatwork.org), “Workin’ It is a lively one-hour, magazine program that will make you think, laugh, and do something to bring progressive values of justice and fair play into the American workplace,” says former Congressman David Bonior who chairs American Rights at Work.  Mixing hard facts with humor, the show will combine news updates, features on the daily work lives of regular Americans, and interviews with politicians, activists, and celebrities.  Bonior will also appear regularly on the show as a commentator.

 

<p>“It’s important that progressives remember that protecting workers rights is vital part our vision for America.” noted Guerra.  “Workin’ It will remind us that we’re all workers that want the same things.  Whether you’re a janitor in Los Angeles, an office worker in Washington, DC, or a nurse from Boise, we all want to earn a decent living and be able to provide for our families.”

 

<p>In the inaugural show, Guerra will interview actor and political activist Danny Glover and 2004 Democratic vice-presidential nominee John Edwards.  The show will also feature weekly commentaries from former Democratic Whip and American Rights at Work Board Chair David Bonior.  Future shows will feature interviews with Pulitzer Prize-winning author and radio network personality Studs Terkel and tackle topics including student activism on workers’ rights.
