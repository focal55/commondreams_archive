<p>WASHINGTON - October 18 -  A coalition of over thirty-five religious and environmental groups will issue a united statement and call to action tomorrow as part of a national movement to make environmental stewardship and creation care a top policy priority, especially in response to global warming. Centered on the new film <a href="http://www.thegreatwarming.com/" target="_new"><i>The Great Warming</i></a>, this movement will reach people from all walks of life encouraging good environmental stewardship and immediate action to address climate change. 

<p>"Global warming affects everyone regardless of religion, political affiliation or income level" said Carl Pope, Executive Director of Sierra Club. "Heightened concern about global warming’s impact on the poor has united groups with concerns about poverty and justice, like the Sierra Club and leading religious institutions."   

<p>The Great Warming Call to Action statement -- signed by high-profile religious leaders from across the faith and ideological spectrum, key policy-makers, celebrities, environmental groups, and many of the most respected scientists in the world -- calls on our country to take immediate action to address climate change. 

<p>As part of this alliance, the Sierra Club has joined with faith groups like Christian Coalition and the Religious Action Center of Reformed Judaism in seeking to engage a wide array of people, including those who are not yet global warming believers, around simple solutions that can help reduce the threat of global warming. The coalition is urging all Americans, especially those who are skeptical about climate change, to see the movie. In major cities across the country, practical efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions are also being undertaken; letting decision makers at all levels know that global warming is an urgent priority. 

<p>"The Great Warming provides an excellent opportunity for dialogue and action about global warming," said Lyndsay Moseley, Associate Washington Representative for Faith Partnerships at the Sierra Club. "Our goal is to help people care for one another and future generations by being part of the solution to global warming, not the problem."   

<p>Members of the movement are hoping that The Great Warming will play a major role in converting climate skeptics, just as Al Gore’s Inconvenient Truth helped open eyes with its charts and predictions. Reflecting the emerging voice of the evangelical community, The Great Warming reveals how climate change is affecting the lives of people everywhere. While the film presents a moving picture of a world changed by global warming, it also makes a business case for taking action. With hard-hitting comments from scientists, religious leaders, and public-opinion leaders the film taps into the growing public interest and the growing concern within the faith community. 

<p>The Great Warming will launch in Regal Cinemas across the U.S. November 3rd.
