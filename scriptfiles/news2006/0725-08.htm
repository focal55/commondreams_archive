<p>WASHINGTON - July 25 - 

In February this year, three former U.S. diplomats toured the Mideast as 
part of an independent delegation and met with President Bashar al-Assad 
of Syria, President Emile Lahoud of Lebanon, Hassan Nasrallah of 
Hezbollah, various Hamas officials and Amr Mousa, secretary general of 
the Arab League.

    A former U.S. ambassador to Greece and Zimbabwe, Keeley said today: 
"It was remarkably easy for us to get meetings with the major players in 
the region. I think that's because there has been so little dialogue 
between them and our officials.
<p>"When we were in Lebanon, I found that our ambassador doesn't talk 
to the Lebanese president. [Mideast NSC official] Elliott Abrams had 
been there, but he doesn't talk to the Lebanese president either.
<p>"Even among the undemocratic leaders, we found enthusiasm for the 
concept of democracy in the region, but the U.S. is viewed as totally 
hypocritical, only backing democracy when the people it wants win.
<p>"We need to stop castigating and threatening -- and start talking 
and listening."

    Peck, a former U.S. chief of mission in Iraq and ambassador to 
Mauritania, was deputy director of the White House Task Force on 
Terrorism in the Reagan administration. He said today: "Israel wants and 
needs to live in peace and security with her neighbors. That will never 
be achieved under her current policy. ... In this context, the silence 
about the tragedy in Gaza, since the events in Lebanon, will be part of 
the costs to Israel and to the United States -- and I do not want to be 
right."

President of the Center for the National Interest, Bird said today: "While in Lebanon we met with the president, the prime minister and 
Nasrallah. All three emphasized the following three points: Israel had 
not fully withdrawn from Lebanese territory -- this is separate from the 
Shebaa Farms issue. There are three areas of just a few thousand square 
feet, but they are military positions.
<p>"Second, they emphasized that Israel has not given a map to 
thousands of landmines it left in Lebanon as it was supposed to do. 
These mines regularly kill people. Third, they emphasized the abduction 
of three Lebanese who were taken from Lebanese territory by Israel. I 
asked Nasrallah what he would do about these people. He said that there 
was only one way to free them, and that was to capture Israeli soldiers. 
What Hezbollah is doing may seem to be foolish, especially in the short 
term, but we need to understand the facts involved.
<p>"The United States could have probably prevented all this from 
happening if they had taken any action to answer the complaints of the 
Lebanese government." Bird is a 23-year veteran with the United States 
Foreign Service and the former Counselor of Embassy in Saudi Arabia.
