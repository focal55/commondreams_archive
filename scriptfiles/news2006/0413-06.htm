<p>SYDNEY / JAKARTA - April 13 - A new detailed map (1) - released by 
Greenpeace and Forest Watch Indonesia today - reveals plans to cut down 
as much as 35% (29 million hectares) of New Guinea Island's rainforest, 
the 'Eden' where scientists recently discovered a host of new species (2).

<p>The environmental organisations have collated and mapped government 
logging concessions in the Paradise Forests of Asia Pacific (3). The new 
map shows that 24% of Papua's forests and as much 46% of Papua New 
Guinea's (PNG) forests have already been sold as concessions to logging 
companies, which export tropical timber to feed demand for cheap wood in 
Japan, US, EU and China.

<p>"These are some of the most biologically rich forests in the world but a 
handful of logging companies (4) are wiping them out faster than any 
other on Earth. Unless the Indonesian and PNG Governments stop selling 
off these precious forests they, and the incredible diversity of life 
they support, will be decimated over the next few years," said Emmy 
Hafild, Executive Director of Greenpeace Southeast Asia.

<p>Much of the large, intact forest landscapes in the Paradise Forests have 
already been cut down -- 72% in Indonesia and 60% in PNG. New Guinea 
Island has the largest remaining area of intact forest in Asia Pacific, 
but it is not adequately protected.

<p>"To save these threatened rainforests, the Papua and PNG governments 
must cancel the logging concessions immediately, review their forest 
policies and permanently protect large areas of the rainforest," said 
Hafild.

<p>Today's map is based on a Greenpeace world map made using groundbreaking 
satellite technology. The map reveals that forests are in critical 
condition worldwide and that less than 10% of the Earth's land area 
remains as large intact forest areas. (5) 

<p>Greenpeace has launched a project in Papua to set the stage for 
eco-enterprises that will help protect what is left of the largest 
intact, pristine forest in the region. It has also set up a Global 
Forest Rescue Station in the forests of PNG, where volunteers are 
working with landowners and other environment groups to protect the 
forests from illegal and destructive logging.

<p>Greenpeace flagship, the Rainbow Warrior, is arriving in Jakarta on 
April 22,
2006 to continue on its mission to protect the Paradise Forests from 
illegal and
destructive logging.

Greenpeace is an independent, campaigning organisation which uses 
non-violent, creative confrontation to expose global environmental 
problems, and to force solutions essential to a green and peaceful 
future. It is committed to protecting the world's last ancient forests 
and the people and animals that depend upon them.

(3) The Paradise Forests stretch from Southeast Asia, across the islands of Indonesia and on towards Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands in the Pacific.<br>

(4) Most of the rainforests are logged by just a few Indonesian and 
multinational logging companies, such as Kayu Lapis Indonesia, Korindo 
Group (Korea, Indonesia), Barito Pacific (UK, Indonesia), Djajanti Group 
(Indonesia), PT Hanurata (Indonesia) and PT Wapoga Mutiara Timber  
(subsidiary of Rimbunan Hijau, Malaysia). In Papua New Guinea, Malaysian 
logging company, Rimbunan Hijau, controls almost 50% of log exports from 
the country, and Malaysian companies control over 80% of the trade.<br>
