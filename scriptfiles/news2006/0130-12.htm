<p>WASHINGTON   - January 30 - Citizens for Responsibility  and Ethics in Washington (CREW) today sued the US Department of  Homeland Security (DHS) over its continued refusal to respond to a  Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request on Katrina-related  issues.  </p>
<p>   On September 7, 2005, CREW sent a FOIA request to DHS and its  component, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), asking  for records and communications regarding the federal government's  preparedness for and response to hurricane Katrina.  CREW  requested an expedited response from DHS on the FOIA, which was  denied by DHS on September 20, 2005.  CREW appealed on October 24,  2005, urging the agency to quickly release documents that would  inform the public about the circumstances surrounding FEMA's  response to Katrina. On December 21, 2005 DHS again denied CREW's  request for expedited treatment, forcing CREW to sue DHS for the  information.</p>
<p>   Specifically, CREW asked DHS for: </p>
<p>   -- communications between the White House and FEMA regarding  the preparation for and response to the damage caused by Hurricane  Katrina;</p>
<p>   -- communications regarding offers by corporations and foreign  governments to assist the victims of Katrina, and FEMA's response  to such offers; </p>
<p>   -- information regarding the portion of the $3.1 billion 2005  DHS budget for emergency preparedness that was used to prepare for  hurricanes on the Gulf Coast and for potential flooding in New  Orleans;</p>
<p>   -- information regarding the amount of money that was diverted  from natural disaster emergency preparedness to terrorism  emergency preparedness and the rationale for any such diversion; </p>
<p>   -- studies, assessments, presentations and scenarios created  demonstrating the potential impact of a powerful hurricane on the  Gulf Coast and proposed responses to such scenarios.</p>
<p>   &quot;The Administration continues to stonewall anyone -- whether a  Member of Congress or a watchdog organization -- who seeks  information regarding the federal government's preparedness for  and response to Katrina,&quot; Melanie Sloan, executive director of  CREW said today. &quot;President Bush does not have the prerogative to  refuse to release documents responsive to a FOIA request. </p>
<p>   Clearly, the Administration is trying to shield its  incompetence from the American people by refusing to comply with  legitimate requests for information.&quot; Sloan continued, &quot;from  Abramoff to Katrina, the Administration is trying to conceal the  facts from its citizenry. We urge the Administration to release  the Katrina-related documents today.&quot;   </p>
<p>   CREW's FOIA and the DHS responses are available at  <a href="http://releases.usnewswire.com/redir.asp?ReleaseID=60076&Link=http://www.citizensforethics.org">http://www.citizensforethics.org</a> </p>
