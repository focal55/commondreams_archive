<p> CAPE TOWN - February 27 -   After spending 73 days at sea defending the whales in the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary, the Greenpeace ship MY Esperanza is preparing to set sail again, this time to turn world attention on the plague of pirate fishing (1). Every day, in every ocean, pirate fishing boats are stealing fish and leaving a trail of environmental destruction in their wake.
    </p>

<div class="body">    
      Greenpeace and the Environmental Justice Foundation are working
together to expose the pirate fishing fleets that operate without
sanction across the globe. Together the international environment and
human rights organisations are demanding that governments close ports
to ban pirates, deny them access to markets and prosecute companies
supporting them.<br><br>Globally,
pirate fishing could be worth anywhere between US$4 billion and
US$9billion a year - 20% of the total fish catch. It is estimated that
pirate fishing just in sub Saharan Africa is worth US$1billion dollars
annually, while in the waters of the Southern Ocean, up to 50% of the
valuable Patagonian Toothfish may come from illegal activities. Further
north in the Baltic Sea 40% of the cod caught in 2002/2003 is estimated
to have been taken illegal.<br><br>In the Atlantic Ocean alone, pirate
vessels cash in on the lucrative market for tuna, taking thousands of
tons of fish, in complete contravention of international regulations.
The fish are then transferred to refrigerated cargo ships, known as
reefers, "laundered" through legal ports and sold on into the market.<br><br>"Pirate
fishing of Atlantic tuna is just one example of a global problem in
every ocean and with almost every type of fish." said Sebastian Losada
of Greenpeace Spain. "Fish on dinner plates around the world are stolen
from someone else's ocean, denying them food and income. It is a hidden
crime that governments have the power to stop now."<br><br>The impact
on fish stocks is matched by the devastation of marine life through
pirate fishing. Reeling out lines sometimes 100 km long with tens of
thousands of baited hooks, the pirates also snare turtles, sharks and
seabirds. Millions are thrown overboard dead or dying as unwanted
bycatch every year.<br><br>The Esperanza sails to the Atlantic just
days before the ministerial level High Seas Task Force (2) meets to
announce how it plans to further discuss the problem of pirate fishing.<br><br>"
Five years ago governments agreed an International Plan of Action on
pirate fishing - what's left to discuss?" said Helene Bours of the
Environmental Justice Foundation. "Governments need to stop talking and
start acting. Closing ports, markets and prosecuting companies will rid
the oceans of pirate fishermen - it is simply a matter of political
will, not further debate."<br>
<br>
<div class="Section"> <b>Notes to Editor</b>
<p class="notes-to-editor">(1) Pirate fishing is Illegal, Unregulated and Unreported (IUU) fishing.<br />
(2) The OECD High Seas Task Force, which is made up by fisheries ministers from Australia, Canada, Chile, Namibia, New Zealand and the UK, will meet in Paris on March 2nd & 3rd</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0px;">The drive to make piracy history is the second leg of a 14-month global expedition "Defending Our Oceans", the most ambitious ship expedition ever undertaken by Greenpeace to expose the threats to the oceans and demand a global network of properly enforced marine reserves covering 40% of the worlds oceans.  Already 45,000 people have become Ocean Defenders to echo the call. Greenpeace aims to gather a million Ocean Defenders by the end of the
expedition in February 2007.<br />
