<p>WASHINGTON - August 10 - As 
the anniversary of Hurricane Katrina approaches, the American Civil Liberties 
Union's National Prison Project today released <EM>Abandoned &amp; Abused: Orleans 
Parish Prisoners in the Wake of Hurricane Katrina</EM>.&nbsp; The report documents 
the experiences of thousands of men, women and children who were abandoned at 
Orleans Parish Prison (OPP) in the days after the storm.&nbsp; 
<BR>
&nbsp;<BR>
"The prisoners inside the Orleans Parish Prison suffered some of 
the worst horrors of Hurricane Katrina," said Eric Balaban, a staff attorney for 
the National Prison Project.&nbsp; "Because society views prisoners as second-class citizens, their stories have 
largely gone unnoticed and therefore untold."<BR>
&nbsp;<BR>
In conjunction with 
the report's release, the National Prison Project urged the president to direct 
the Department of Justice to evaluate OPP's current evacuation plans in an 
effort to determine whether any meaningful improvements have been made over the 
past year. The ACLU also asked Congress to audit the jail's emergency 
preparedness plans.&nbsp; The ACLU is calling for a full and immediate 
investigation into abuses at Louisiana correctional facilities during and after 
the storm and is also urging the DOJ to make the findings from such an 
investigation public and accessible to state and federal prosecutors. <BR>
&nbsp;<BR>
The ACLU report describes a history of neglect at Orleans Parish 
Prison, one of the most dangerous and mismanaged jails in the country.&nbsp; 
This culture of neglect was evident in the days before Katrina, when the sheriff 
declared that the prisoners would remain "where they belong," despite the 
mayor's decision to declare the city's first-ever mandatory evacuation.&nbsp; OPP even accepted prisoners, including juveniles as young as 10, from other 
facilities to ride out the storm.&nbsp; <BR>
&nbsp;<BR>
As floodwaters rose in the 
OPP buildings, power was lost, and entire buildings were plunged into 
darkness.&nbsp; Deputies left their posts wholesale, leaving behind prisoners in 
locked cells, some standing in sewage-tainted water up to their 
chests.<BR>
&nbsp;<BR>
"The sheriff's office was completely unprepared for the 
storm," said Tom Jawetz, Litigation Fellow for the National Prison 
Project.&nbsp; "The Louisiana Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals 
did more for its 263 stray pets than the sheriff did for the more than 6,500 
men, women and children left in his care."<BR>
&nbsp;<BR>
Prisoners went days 
without food, water and ventilation, and deputies admit that they received no 
emergency training and were entirely unaware of any evacuation plan.&nbsp; Even 
some prison guards were left locked in at their posts to fend for themselves, 
unable to provide assistance to prisoners in need.<BR>
&nbsp;<BR>
The prisoners 
were finally evacuated by order of the state after days of fear and chaos.&nbsp; 
The report follows the prisoners as they were transferred to jails and prisons 
around Louisiana.&nbsp; Thousands of the men were first transported to the Elayn 
Hunt Correctional Center, where they were placed outdoors in a yard with 
inadequate food, medical care, and protection from other prisoners, many of whom 
were armed with makeshift weapons.&nbsp; According to the report, at several 
other facilities, prisoners were subjected to systematic abuse and racially 
motivated assaults by prison guards.<BR>
&nbsp;<BR>
"Some prisoners at Hunt 
attacked other prisoners, and guards did nothing to prevent this from 
happening," said Katie Schwartzmann, a staff attorney for the ACLU of 
Louisiana.&nbsp; "Guards threatened prisoners with guns when they were 
approached for help, and shot at one prisoner who had been stabbed by a group of 
other prisoners."&nbsp; <BR>
&nbsp;<BR>
Among the people profiled in the ACLU 
report are:<BR>
&nbsp;<BR>
<UL><LI>Ivy Gisclair, who was being held at OPP for $700 
in traffic violations (mostly parking tickets) and had never been in any serious 
trouble with the law. After days in OPP following the storm, Ivy was transferred 
to Hunt, where he witnessed stabbings, rapes and countless fights. Ivy was 
finally transferred to Bossier Parish Maximum Security Prison. His release date 
came and went. When he asked a guard about it, he was pepper sprayed, repeatedly 
shocked with a Taser, beaten by multiple guards, and put in solitary confinement 
with no clothes. Ivy was released in an orange prison jumpsuit at a gas station 
by the side of the road, three weeks after his scheduled release date. It was 
the day of Hurricane Rita.<LI>Renard Reed, a guard at OPP's 
psychiatric ward who reported to work before the hurricane out of a sense of 
camaraderie and shared responsibility. Like many other guards, Renard was locked 
in during his shift to prevent desertion, and was then ordered to go to the roof 
with a shotgun and shoot anyone trying to leave one of the flooded buildings. He 
was still stranded at the prison long after the prisoners were 
evacuated.<LI>Ashley George, a 13-year-old girl housed in OPP's 
Youth Center, who was moved to an area adjacent to an adult male holding area 
where the men watched her use the toilet. As the building began to flood, Ashley 
spent days in water up to her neck. Adult prisoners rescued Ashley and the other 
children from the waters. After being taken to the bridge for evacuation, Ashley 
was lucky enough to be given a bag of potato chips and water. She reports again 
being forced to relieve herself publicly and that pregnant girls received no 
assistance or treatment.</LI></UL>"These are the untold horrors of Hurricane 
Katrina," Balaban said. "We must preserve these stories to create a record of 
the tragedy and to ensure that the mistakes detailed in this report are never 
repeated."<BR>&nbsp;<BR>The report, along with several multimedia features 
including a slide show, video footage and maps, is online at: <A class=noline_blue href="http://www.aclu.org/prison/conditions/26198res20060809.html">www.aclu.org/prison/conditions/26198res20060809.html</A><P></P>
