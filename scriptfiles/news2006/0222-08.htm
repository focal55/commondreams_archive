<p>WASHINGTON - February 22 - Today, Citizens for  Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) filed a complaint  with the Senate Ethics Committee alleging that Senator Rick  Santorum (R-PA) violated the Senate Gift Rule by accepting a  mortgage from The Philadelphia Trust Company, a bank that serves  affluent clients.</p>
<p>   CREW based its complaint on a story by Will Bunch that first  appeared in the Philadelphia Daily News on February 21, 2006.   According to the article, in 2002, Sen. Santorum and his wife  received a $500,000 five-year mortgage for their Leesburg, VA  home from Philadelphia Trust.  The bank's web site states that  &quot;banking services are available only to investment advisory  clients whose portfolios we manage, oversee or administer.&quot;  The  Daily News reporter called the bank, which confirmed that it  offers mortgages only to investors and not to the general public.</p>
<p>   Sen. Santorum's financial disclosure forms for 2001 and 2002  show no investment portfolio with Philadelphia Trust.  Moreover,  in 2002, the year Sen. Santorum obtained the mortgage, his  financial disclosure forms indicate that his investments did not  exceed $145,000.</p>
<p>   Rule 35 of the Senate Code of Official Conduct bans Senators  from accepting gifts and specifically includes &quot;loans&quot; within the  definition of &quot;gifts.&quot;  The Gift Rule also provides that Senators  can accept loans from banks and other financial institutions on  terms &quot;generally available to the public.&quot;</p>
<p>   CREW's complaint alleges that because a &quot;loan&quot; constitutes a  &quot;gift,&quot; because Sen. Santorum did not meet Philadelphia Trust's  clientele criteria, and because the Senator was not, in fact, a  bank client at the time he received the mortgage, Sen. Santorum  violated the Gift Rule.</p>
<p>   CREW's complaint also notes that Philadelphia Trust officials  have contributed a total of $23,250 to Sen. Santorum's campaign  and his political action committee, America's Foundation.</p>
<p>   Melanie Sloan, CREW's executive director, stated &quot;the public  has the right to expect that Senators -- just like everybody else  -- will follow the rules.  Sen. Santorum's decision to accept a  loan not available to other people in his financial position  demonstrates his contempt for the rules.  This is particularly  ironic given that Sen. Santorum has long attempted to position  himself as the poster child for public morality.&quot;</p>
<p>   Sloan continued, &quot;ethical trespasses have become the norm for  Sen. Santorum, which begs the question: how serious is Majority  Leader Frist in changing the way in which the Senate does its  business, considering he appointed Sen. Santorum to be the point  person on ethics reform?&quot;</p>
<p>   &quot;Although there is no evidence that Sen. Santorum has used his  official position to benefit Philadelphia Trust, the receipt of  the loan from the bank creates exactly the sort of appearance of  impropriety that the Gift Rule was designed to address.&quot;</p>
<p>   A copy of CREW's complaint is available on its website,  <a href="http://releases.usnewswire.com/redir.asp?ReleaseID=61339&Link=http://www.citizensforethics.org">http://www.citizensforethics.org</a>.</p>
