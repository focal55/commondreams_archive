<p>WASHINGTON - July 13 - As the Group of 8 (G8) 
wealthy nations launch their annual meeting in St. Petersburg, Russia 
over the coming weekend, Africa Action today released a new set of 
talking points on the G8 and Africa, urging new action from G8 leaders 
on urgent African priorities - from the continent's debt crisis, to the 
HIV/AIDS pandemic, to the ongoing genocide in Darfur. Also today, Africa 
Action released a letter to President Bush, signed by 300 religious 
leaders of diverse religious traditions, urging greater global 
engagement in support of African efforts to address the continent's 
challenges.

<p>The letter to President Bush was circulated by Africa Action's Religious 
Action Network, an interfaith network of religious leaders and their 
communities committed to positively shaping U.S. Africa relations. The 
full text of the Religious Leader Letter to the G8 on HIV/AIDS and Debt 
is available on Africa Action's website here: 
<a href="http://www.africaaction.org/campaign_new/docs/2006G8SignOnFinal.pdf%20" target="_new">http://www.africaaction.org/campaign_new/docs/2006G8SignOnFinal.pdf
</a>
<p>Ann-Louise Colgan, Acting Co-Executive Director of Africa Action, said 
today, "Last year's G8 agenda rightly concentrated on Africa's 
challenges. But promises made last year - on debt cancellation and 
universal access to HIV/AIDS treatment - must not be forgotten now, and 
new action is required from the G8 on these urgent issues. The G8 
represent a global elite, and as this year's summit begins, they must 
address the priorities of the global majority."

<p>Marie Clarke Brill, Acting Co-Executive Director of Africa Action, said 
today, "Activists around the world have heard the G8 pledges towards 
Africa, and they are still waiting for the G8 to fully deliver on these 
promises. Hundreds of religious leaders have signed on to a letter to 
President Bush, calling on him to show leadership at the G8 summit to 
tackle the HIV/AIDS pandemic and to cancel 100% of Africa's debt. They 
represent a much larger population of people who refuse to allow the G8 
to marginalize Africa's concerns."

<p>This year's G8 summit will include discussion on three priorities: 
infectious disease, global energy security and education. While the 
explicit focus on Africa's challenges has disappeared from the agenda, 
the "Africa Action Talking Points on the G8 and Africa" - included below 
- demonstrate both that those challenges continue to require action and 
that Africa has a role to play in dealing with the concerns on this 
year's G8 agenda.

<p>The G8 discussion of infectious disease will seek to address the global 
response to epidemic threats. The recent "Africa Action Statement on 
Avian Influenza and Africa," underscores how, in light of Africa's 
experience with HIV/AIDS and the risk of avian flu, a new G8 focus on 
strengthening Africa's health systems is required. This resource is 
available here: <a href="http://www.africaaction.org/newsroom/docs/avianflu0606.pdf%20" target="_new">http://www.africaaction.org/newsroom/docs/avianflu0606.pdf
</a>
<p>One week prior to the G8 launch, Africa Action released a statement on 
last year's G8 promises on Africa's debt, entitled "Africa Out of the 
Limelight: The Debt Crisis One Year After the Gleneagles G8." This 
document outlines the developments on this issue in the past year and 
emphasizes the pressing need for 100% debt cancellation. It is available 
here: <a href="http://www.africaaction.org/newsroom/docs/G8debtstatement06.pdf%20" target="_new">http://www.africaaction.org/newsroom/docs/G8debtstatement06.pdf
</a>
<p>Also today, Africa Action is publishing an op-ed entitled "The G8 & 
Africa: Reality Check" with the Foreign Policy Association, providing an 
analysis of the results of the 2005 G8 promises, as well as a glimpse of 
upcoming G8 priorities.
