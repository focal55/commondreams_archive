<p>KANSAS CITY, Missouri - November 6 - Leaders of the  community group ACORN today applauded the FBI for the steps it is  taking to investigate individuals suspected in several cases of  possible voter registration fraud that the group reported to  authorities during a recent ACORN voter registration drive in the  Kansas City area.</p>
<p>   The individuals under investigation were temporary workers,  hired--and later fired-by Kansas City ACORN (Association of  Community Organizations for Reform Now) to help in its large- scale voter registration drive, which helps thousands of Kansas  City residents register to vote.  </p>
<p>   ACORN took the initiative on October 11 to contact the Kansas  City Board of Elections and the Jackson County Prosecutor when  the organization's standard review process identified suspicious  voter registration applications. ACORN provided to the Board and  the prosecutor a letter with the name and contact information of  the former employees who had collected the suspicious  application. ACORN then facilitated the subsequent FBI inquiry by  providing internal records documenting ACORN's suspicion and  other information as requested.. ACORN will continue to provide  its full support and cooperation in the investigation.</p>
<p>   &quot;When we caught this misconduct, we reporter it to the  authorities. Now we want to see these folks  prosecuted to the  full extent of the law, because they have defrauded our  organization, and, worse, detracted from our mission of ensuring  that citizens in our community participate in the democratic  process,&quot; said Claudia Harris, Chairperson of  Kansas City ACORN.</p>
<p>   &quot;Like the FBI, ACORN considers any interference in the voting  process to be a very serious matter,&quot; Harris continued. &quot;Across  the state our attorneys today reached a settlement with the St.  Louis Board of Elections to issue a retraction of the  intimidating letter they sent out to thousands of voters we  registered. Vigilance is needed to make sure that Scott  Leindecker's St. Louis Board of Elections does not engage in any  other dirty tricks to suppress the African American vote.&quot;</p>
<p>   ACORN's voter registration drives are committed to one  objective:  Registration of eligible low-income and minority  citizens who wish to vote and have their votes counted. In the  past year, ACORN has helped tens of thousands of Missouri  residents register to vote. As part of ACORN's voter registration  program, ACORN has a comprehensive quality control that reviews  all application for completeness and accuracy and calls  applicants to verify their information. It was this process that  identified the individuals who were referred to the Board and  Prosecutors.</p>
