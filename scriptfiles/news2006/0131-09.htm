<p>WASHINGTON - January 31 - The murder of six former co-workers and subsequent suicide by a Goleta, California, ex-postal worker fits the tragic pattern--the use of a firearm--that defines almost all of the more than 1,300 estimated deaths that result each year from murder-suicide, according to the Violence Policy Center (VPC).  In 2002, the VPC published the largest study of murder-suicides ever conducted, American Roulette:  The Untold Story of Murder-Suicide in the United States. The study was based on data collected in the first six months of 2001.  It found that California--with 29 murder-suicide incidents in the first half of 2001--was second only to Florida, and tied with Texas, in the number of murder-suicides incidents. For the full text of the study, please see <a href="http://www.vpc.org/studies/amercont.htm">http://www.vpc.org/studies/amercont.htm</a>.  The study is currently being updated by the VPC using 2005 incidents for release later this year.

 

<p>Findings of the 2002 study included:

 

<p>
<ul>
<li>Unlike the Goleta, California, murder-suicide, where a woman was the shooter,  the VPC study found that men were the murderers in 90.4 percent of incidents.<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>The VPC study found that 94.5 percent of murder-suicide incidents studied involved a firearm, most often a handgun.<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>The VPC study estimates that there are more than 1,300 murder-suicide deaths per year.<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>Unlike the Goleta, California, shooting, 76 percent of murder-suicides analyzed in the VPC study occurred in the home.</li>
</ul>
<p>VPC Legislative Director Kristen Rand states, "Most people think of suicide as a solitary act.  In fact, many people with suicidal thoughts are also intent on taking other people with them, and guns make it far too easy to commit mass murder-suicide.  America needs to fully understand the risk of murder-suicide and the pivotal role that firearms play."
