<p>WASHINGTON - May 8 - Larry Cox, Amnesty  International's executive director, made the following statement in  response to President Bush's remarks on May 4 regarding his desire  to close the U.S. detention center in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba:</p>
<p>   &quot;If President Bush was serious when he said 'I would very much  like to end Guantanamo,' then he needs to take decisive action to  make that happen.  Amnesty International has been calling for the  closure of the detention center at Guantanamo for almost a year.   Additionally, if the president really wants to respect the Supreme  Court's decision on the fairness of the military commissions, then  he should stay the pending cases and withdraw the presidential  military order that created these sham trials.  Amnesty  International welcomes any decision, presidential or court-ordered,  that removes detainees from the legal limbo in which they are  currently trapped.&quot;</p>
<p>   Amnesty International called for the closure of the U.S.  detention center in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba on May 25, 2005, ( <a href="http://releases.usnewswire.com/redir.asp?ReleaseID=65365&Link=http://www.amnestyusa.org/annualreport/statement.html">http://www.amnestyusa.org/annualreport/statement.html</a> )</p>
