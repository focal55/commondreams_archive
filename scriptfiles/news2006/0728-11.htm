<p>WASHINGTON - July 28 - 

<p><b><a href="mailto:gael@codepinkalert.org">MEDEA BENJAMIN</a></b>, <a href="http://www.TroopsHomeFast.org" target="_new">http://www.TroopsHomeFast.org</a><br>
Benjamin is cofounder of CodePink, a women's peace group, and Global 
Exchange. She stood up and spoke as Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki 
addressed a joint session of Congress today.
<p>CodePink said in a statement released this afternoon that Benjamin 
is on her 23rd day of a long-term fast for peace called the <a href="http://www.TroopsHomeFast.org" target="_new">Troops Home 
FAST</a>, which has been based in front of the White House. Fasters are 
available for interviews.
<p>During a segment of his speech in which al-Maliki said that Iraqis' 
ink-stained fingers evidenced their desire for democracy, Benjamin stood 
up in the House gallery and shouted, "Iraqis want the troops to leave, 
bring them home now! Listen to the Iraqis!" Benjamin repeated the 
statement several times before she was forcefully lifted from her seat, 
handcuffed and escorted out by Capitol police.

<p><b><a href="mailto:jarrar.raed@gmail.com">RAED JARRAR</a></b>,  
<a href="http://raedinthemiddle.blogspot.com/2006/07/iraq-raped.html" target="_new">http://raedinthemiddle.blogspot.com/2006/07/iraq-raped.html</a><br>

    Currently in Washington, D.C., Jarrar is the director for the Iraq 
Project of the Institute for Policy Studies and Global Exchange. He said 
today: "The rhetoric surrounding al-Maliki's speech was that the U.S. 
government is backing democracy in Iraq. But when he articulates views 
widely held by Iraqis, he is attacked by elements of the U.S. government.
<p>"This week, the most notable example was al-Maliki saying that 
Israel was the aggressor in Lebanon, a view held by the vast majority of 
Iraqis, and he was attacked for this."
<p>Jarrar added: "Last month, when he proposed a comprehensive 28-point 
package for Iraqi reconciliation and an end to violence, the plan was 
warmly received by different Iraqi political, religious and even 
insurgent leaders. But the U.S. Embassy turned that 28-point package 
into a weak 24-point plan that was rejected by everyone. The four 
dropped demands were: establishing a timetable for pulling out the 
occupation troops, amnesty for anyone who has not killed civilians, 
compensation for civilian victims and an immediate halt of all raids on 
homes and cities without Iraqi court orders.
<p>"Mowaffak al-Rubaie, Iraq's National Security Adviser, recently 
wrote: 'While Iraq is trying to gain its independence from the United 
States and the coalition, in terms of taking greater responsibility for 
its actions, particularly in terms of security, there are still some 
influential foreign figures trying to spoon-feed our government and take 
a very proactive role in many key decisions.'"
