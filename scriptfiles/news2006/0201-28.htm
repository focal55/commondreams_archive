<p>WASHINGTON - February 1 - For the second time in as many months, Congress has revealed its skewed priorities by passing a budget reconciliation bill that cuts programs of vital importance to working families, including Medicaid, Medicare and student loans. At a time when Congressional leadership and President Bush push to extend hundreds of billions of dollars in tax breaks for the wealthy, it’s unconscionable that they would choose to slash $39 billion dollars from programs that are a lifeline for millions of Americans. 

<p>As America’s workers are contending with falling wages, skyrocketing health care costs and vanishing retirement security, these cuts cruelly add insult to injury. Today’s vote is all the more difficult to stomach knowing President Bush’s 2007 budget, which will be released next week, will undoubtedly propose further devastating cuts to working family-supporting programs. 

<p>President Bush said last night in his State of the Union address that “Americans should not fear our economic future, because we intend to shape it.” With today’s vote, it’s clear what kind of economic future the President and his allies in Congress are shaping for America’s workers: A future that unfairly rewards the privileged while burdening society’s vulnerable with additional hardship.
