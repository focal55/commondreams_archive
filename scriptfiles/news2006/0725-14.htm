<p>WASHINGTON - July 25 - Nancy Keenan, president of NARAL Pro-Choice America, called on the Senate to protect our young people's safety and vote against the so-called "Child Custody Protection Act" later today. This divisive and controversial legislation would prohibit any adult other than a parent—including a grandparent, aunt, adult sibling, or member of the clergy—from accompanying a young woman across state lines for abortion care if the home state's parental-involvement law has not been met.  

<p>"We all agree that teens in trouble should talk to their parents, and thankfully, most do. However, if they can't, for whatever reason, their safety is the most important thing," Keenan said. "The American public wants teen pregnancy prevented, not punished. This bill does nothing to protect young people or promote communication between teens and their parents."

<p>Keenan also said today's legislation further exposes how out of touch Sen. Bill Frist and his anti-choice allies are with the American people's priorities. 

<p>"If Sen. Frist and his anti-choice colleagues honestly want to protect our teens, they should stop blocking votes on commonsense measures to prevent unintended pregnancies and reduce the need for abortion. Congress should fund programs that provide honest, realistic sex education, teach young people about the serious responsibilities that accompany parenthood, and stop slashing budgets for after-school programs that keep kids out of trouble and on the road to success. Prevention - not punishment - is the better path for the Senate to take."

<p>Keenan said the United States, where 866,000 teenagers become pregnant each year, has the highest rates of teen pregnancy in the Western industrialized world. She cited an amendment that Sens. Robert Menendez and Frank Lautenberg, both Democrats from New Jersey, are planning to offer that would fund teen-pregnancy-prevention programs in schools and community groups, pilot programs to teach young people about the serious responsibilities that come with parenthood, and programs that help parents talk to their kids about tough topics like sex.  Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) intends to offer an amendment that would exempt grandparents and clergy members from prosecution. Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-CA) plans to offer an amendment that would exempt young women who are victims of incest, a tragic situation for which today's legislation has no exception.
