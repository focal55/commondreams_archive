<p>WASHINGTON - April 7 - The nonpartisan National Parks Conservation Association (NPCA) today testified at a public hearing in Harrisburg, urging the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board (PGCB) to reject Chance Enterprises’ application for a license to build a casino with up to 5,000 slot machines within a mile of Gettysburg National Military Park.
<p>
“NPCA is concerned that marketing a casino would conflict with and detract from Gettysburg’s unique and compelling history, and its proven economic engine – heritage tourism,” testified Alan Spears, NPCA’s associate director for diversity.  “We urge you not to gamble with Gettysburg’s future, and to deny the application for a Gettysburg-based casino.”
<p>
Gettysburg National Military Park is already a strong economic engine for the area.  As the nation’s premier classroom on the American Civil War, Gettysburg National Military Park attracts more than two million people each year. In 2003, park visitors spent more than $92 million at local businesses and supported 2,852 local jobs. The combination of Civil War preservation and the family friendly nature of Adams County have created a proven, winning formula for the park and its neighboring communities.
<p>
Organizations that wished to apply for one of Pennsylvania’s 14 gaming licenses were required to submit their formal application to the PGCB by December 28, 2005.  As part of the process, the PGCB is holding public hearings on each of the applications for gaming licenses.  During these hearings, applicants, individuals, community organizations, and representatives of county and local governments will express their concerns about the proposed gaming facility.  A decision on who gets the licenses is expected later this year.
<p>
“Gettysburg is an authentic, family-friendly town that allows children and adults to learn about a time in our history that shaped who we are today,” said Cinda Waldbuesser, Pennsylvania program manager for NPCA. “Whether walking through the town or standing on the battlefield, one truly gets a glimpse of what life was like during the battle at Gettysburg.  A casino seems at odds with this atmosphere and with the sacred nature of the land on which so many gave their life for our country.”
<p>
Since 1919, the nonpartisan National Parks Conservation Association has been the leading voice of the American people in protecting and enhancing our National Park System. NPCA, its members, and partners work together to protect the park system and preserve our nation’s natural, historical, and cultural heritage for generations to come. NPCA is a non-profit 501(c)3 organization with more than 300,000 members, including more than 13,000 members in Pennsylvania.<!-- #EndEditable -->
