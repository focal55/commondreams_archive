<p>WASHINGTON - August 22 - <SPAN>I’m proud, as a Sierra Club representative, to stand with these&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN>members of Congress. Real leaders pursue the truth. Real leaders put&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN>public&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN>health and safety first. Real leaders still believe that honesty and&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>integrity are American values.</SPAN>
<P><SPAN>We need accountability in government, especially on issues that&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>affect human health and safety. At Ground Zero, we have seen lies&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>compounded by more lies. And those lies have had a devastatingly harmful&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>impact on the health of thousands of people. We need an end to lies.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN>And Congressman Nadler is right. We should be very vigorous in our&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN>scrutiny&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN>of the process to select a new Inspector General for the federal&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>Environmental Protection Agency.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN>Will that new appointment ensure that our next Inspector General is an&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN>independent&nbsp; investigator who will speak the truth even if it sometimes&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>makes important people uncomfortable?</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN>Or will that new appointment ensure that high quality, high integrity&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN>reports like this one [the August 2003 EPA Inspector General Report)&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>never,&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN>ever happen again?</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN>The Sierra Club thanks these members of Congress for their leadership on&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN>this important issue.</SPAN></P><!-- #EndEditable -->
