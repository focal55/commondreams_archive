<p>WASHINGTON - May 1 - The National Park Service is putting the final touches on a dizzyingly complex formula to determine future funding levels for individual parks, according to an internal memo released today by Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility (PEER). The &ldquo;NPS Scorecard&rdquo; rates parks based upon 33 efficiency and performance &ldquo;metrics&rdquo; spread across four &ldquo;matrix quadrants.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nobody objects to basing management decisions on comparable data but this Rube Goldberg formula takes bureaucratic pretzel making to new heights,&rdquo; stated PEER Executive Director Jeff Ruch, referring to the hilariously convoluted inventions sketched by late Pulitzer Prize-winning cartoonist Rube Goldberg. &ldquo;Using this Scorecard to determine park budgets suggests a stunning vacuum of intelligent leadership in the National Park Service.&rdquo;</p>
<p>  The Park Service claims that the Scorecard implements President Bush&rsquo;s management reform philosophy. As outlined by an April 5, 2006 &ldquo;overview&rdquo; prepared for agency regional directors, the system takes &ldquo;22 efficiency metrics and 11 performance metrics to determine a park&rsquo;s score&hellip; Adjusted efficiency and performance scores are then placed into one of four quadrants on a matrix.&rdquo; At that point&mdash;</p>
<ul>
  <li> &ldquo;Raw scores are adjusted by independent variables that consider &lsquo;uniqueness&rsquo; factors such as acres, new parks, population density, emphasis, climate, and FTE [full time employees], among others;&rdquo;</li>
  <li> Parks with &ldquo;high efficiency [but] low performance scores&rdquo; will be targeted for budget increases; and</li>
  <li> Parks with &ldquo;high efficiency [and] high performance scores&rdquo; would also receive unspecified financial awards.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each park will be responsible for validating its own data. Metrics factors include such items as &ldquo;Base Labor Expenditures as a % of Gross Base Obligations, 4th Quarter Base Obligations as a % of Gross Base Obligations (Non-Labor), Change in Base Funded &lsquo;Full-time Permanent Positions&rsquo; and Supervisory Span of Control (ratio of supervisor to non-supervisor positions).&rdquo;</p>
<p>  In March 2, 2006 testimony before the House Parks Subcommittee, NPS Director Fran Mainella stated &mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>&ldquo;In 2006, the newest version of the Park Scorecard will be tested, piloted, and integrated into the Regional and Servicewide budget formulation processes leading to a national priority list for park base funding requests for use in future budgets.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The time and expense consumed by this giant paper exercise could be better spent hiring rangers and park police officers to protect visitors and the assets they come to see,&rdquo; Ruch added, referring to rising complaints of resource shortages by park superintendents. &ldquo;If this wacky, paint-by-the-numbers Scorecard constitutes a management reform then I am the Easter Bunny.&rdquo;</p>
