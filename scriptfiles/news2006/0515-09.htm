<p>SAN FRANCISCO - May 15 - Calls to the San Francisco social change phone company Working Assets tripled on Friday, following revelations by USA Today that AT&T, BellSouth and Verizon were helping the National Security Agency build a massive database containing tens of millions of telephone records.

<p>While major telecommunications giants are scrambling to explain their voluntary participation in a Bush administration domestic spying program, the San Francisco-based  telephone company Working Assets and its customers have been helping to lead the charge against NSA spying for months. 

<p>Working Assets has joined the ACLU lawsuit against the NSA for illegal wiretapping (and is the only telephone company participating)

<p>Working Assets and its members are opposing the nomination of former NSA director Michael Hayden to head the CIA. 
Working Assets is publishing a book on May 15 by Glenn Greenwald, the blogging community's leading voice on the NSA wiretapping scandal. 

<p>Following the revelations by USA Today that AT&T, BellSouth and Verizon were helping the National Security Agency build a massive database containing tens of millions of telephone call records, consumers nationwide are questioning whether the companies they entrust with their communications are adequately protecting their privacy.  

<p> "Working Assets believes that the warrantless monitoring of phone conversations ordered by the Bush administration is illegal and unacceptable," wrote company President Michael Kieschnick in a letter to current subscribers. "We also unequivocally oppose the disclosure of domestic calling records to the NSA by our nation's telecommunications providers."

<p>Furthermore Kieschnick explains "Working Assets does not give our customer names, addresses or other billing information to any other telecommunications carrier, or the NSA."

<p>The company has created a Web page dedicated to the subject at http://www.workingassets.com/nsadatabase. 

<p>Working Assets is pressing for confirmation from its underlying carrier Sprint that it has not contributed phone records to the NSA database. The liberal wireless and long distance company does not provide customer names, addresses or other billing information to Sprint or any other telecommunications carrier. 

<p>Working Assets will continue to fight illegal wiretapping by the Bush administration and advocate fiercely for the privacy of its members.


<p>For more information - and to schedule an interview with Working Assets president Michael Kieschnick - call Anne Luesing at 415.369.2157 or email aluesing@workingassets.com or bbond@workingassets.com
