<p>NEW ORLEANS - November 15 - ACORN (Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now) is waging its fight against Wal-Mart on international fronts. 
</p>
<p>In India and Mexico, ACORN community organizers played key roles Saturday (Nov. 11) in organized efforts to stop Wal-Mart from expanding in those countries.
</p>
<p>ACORN founder and chief organizer Wade Rathke joined prominent Indian leaders in a protest rally under the banner “India FDI Watch,’’ against corporate retail chains such as Wal-Mart and Reliance Retail. The public meeting announced a broad-based “Alliance for Retail Democracy in India’’ and demanded that the Indian government stop its pro-FDI-pro-corporate, anti-people policy drive. 
</p>
<p>The foreign direct investments would allow outside companies to partner with Indian businesses as a minority interest. The Indian government has expressed favor for FDI in real estate to enable the construction of large shopping malls to facilitate retail.
</p>
<p>“India is seen as the next frontier of global capitalist expansion, as can be witnessed daily in media reports and in the unprecedented rate and aggression by which government policies and laws are changing and corporate power is rising,’’ said Rathke, a keynote speaker at the rally.
</p>
<p>In Mexico City, ACORN Latin America organizer Ercilia Sahores joined 75 other leaders of labor unions, small businesses, human rights groups and others to form a common front to fight the expansion of Wal-Mart at the Frst Binational U.S.-Mexico Meeting Against Wal-Mart. 
</p>
<p>“We all agreed to work together to prevent Wal-Mart from harming workers, local businesses, public markets, the environment, communities and historical sites in Mexico,’’ Sahores said. “We are fighting the world's biggest retailer, a global giant, our strategy has to be global, as well.’’
</p>
<p>Mexican progressives are planning a protest against Wal-Mart Tuesday, Nov. 14, outside its shareholders meeting in Mexico.
</p>
<p>In the United States, ACORN has led successful campaigns against Wal-Mart in Florida, California and Chicago, from restricting the size of big-box retailers to demanding Wal-Mart pay its employees a living wage.
