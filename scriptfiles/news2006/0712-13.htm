<p>WASHINGTON - July 12 -  Green candidates and Green Party leaders called on the White House and the United Nations to press Israel to halt its invasion of the Gaza Strip.

<p>"Israel is now using the capture of an Israeli soldier and the Palestinian Qassam rocket attacks as a pretext for inflicting death and mayhem on the Palestinian civilian population and infrastructure, and for the mass arrest of elected Hamas officials," said <a href="http://www.bergforcongress.us" target="_new">Michael Berg</a>, Delaware Green candidate for the U.S. House. 

<p>"Collective punishment and targeted killing of civilians are crimes punishable under the 4th Geneva Convention. The U.S. and U.N. must demand that Israel halt these actions immediately."

<p>The Green Party has repeatedly called for an end to Israel's occupation of Palestinian territories, in accord with international law, and has condemned all violence directed against unarmed civilians, whether committed by the state of Israel or by Israeli or Palestinian guerrillas.

<p>Greens support Israeli and Palestinian organizations dedicated to peace, justice, and equality in their efforts to find a nonviolent resolution. The party has sharply criticized the governments of Israel and the U.S. for cutting off funding, water, and electricity to Palestine and other measures to create economic hardship on Palestinians, including expulsion from and destruction of homes and farms and the continuation of Israeli settlements.

<p>"When Congress passed H.R. 4681, which severely cut U.S. aid to the Palestinian people as long as Hamas is in power, it rejected the right of Palestinians to elect their own government by democratic vote," said <a href="http://www.dixon4senate.com" target="_new">Aaron Dixon</a>, Washington Green for U.S. Senate. "While Hamas observed a ceasefire for over a year and has taken steps towards recognizing Israel, the Olmert government repeatedly violated the ceasefire, assassinated Hamas leaders, bombed a power plant that provides electricity for hospitals and water treatment plants, and allowed sniper-shootings and imprisonment of Palestinian women and children."

<p>In November, 2005, the Green Party <a href="http://www.gp.org/press/pr_2005_11_28.shtml" target="_new">endorsed a resolution</a> calling for divestment and a general boycott of Israel until it complies with international law and realizes human rights for Palestinians, including those living within Israel's borders.

<p>Greens have also endorsed the Palestinian Right of Return, consistent with U.N. General Assembly Resolution 194 (nonbinding, passed December 11, 1948), which states that "refugees wishing to return to their homes and live at peace with their neighbors should be permitted to do so at the earliest practicable date."
