<p>WASHINGTON - June 7 - Today's Senate  derailment of the Federal Marriage Amendment is a good thing, but  the floor vote never should have taken place, according to  Americans United for Separation of Church and State.</p>
<p>   The amendment, S.J. Res. 1, failed on a 49-48 procedural vote.  Sixty votes were necessary to bring the measure to the floor. </p>
<p>   &quot;This vote was election-year politics at its worst,&quot; said the  Rev. Barry W. Lynn, Americans United executive director. &quot;I'm  glad the amendment was derailed, but it never should have been  voted on. This vote was nothing but ammo for attack ads.</p>
<p>   &quot;Playing politics with the Constitution is disgraceful,&quot; Lynn  continued. </p>
<p>   Lynn noted that James Dobson's Focus on the Family Action is  already running ads attacking 15 senators who fail to conform to  Dobson's agenda. The ads show a sad-looking boy and feature the  headline, &quot;Why doesn't Senator (senator's last name here) believe  every child needs a mother and a father?&quot;</p>
<p>   &quot;This is pure demagoguery,&quot; said Lynn. &quot;Dobson and his  Religious Right cronies are playing the worst kind of hardball  politics.&quot;</p>
<p>   The so-called &quot;Marriage Protection Amendment&quot; would revise the  U.S. Constitution to mandate that marriage &quot;shall consist only of  the union of a man and a woman.&quot; Americans United charged that  the measure is a Religious Right-inspired effort to write the  majority faiths' marriage doctrines and rituals into the  Constitution.</p>
