<p>WASHINGTON - February 7 - In a letter sent today to the Members of the U.S. Senate 
and House of Representatives Committees on Appropriations, 60 business, 
environmental, and faith-based organizations urged Congress to reject the 
White House Fiscal Year 2007 (FY07) budget request for the U.S. Department 
of Energy’s renewable energy and energy efficiency programs.  Instead, they 
called for full funding of the cross-section of sustainable energy programs 
up to the levels authorized by the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPAct).

<p>The Administration is seeking increases for a few programs such as 
photovoltaics, biofuels, fuel cells, and hydrogen.  Yet even these would be 
funded at levels below that authorized by EPAct while other core accounts 
such as geothermal, concentrating solar, hydropower, weatherization, and a 
number of energy efficiency programs would face deep cuts or be eliminated 
altogether.  Accordingly, the groups view “the proposed cut-backs in the 
federal investment in sustainable energy research, development, deployment, 
and grants [to be] illogical, irresponsible, and a totally unacceptable 
strategic mistake.”

<p>Citing the worsening problems of climate change, rising energy prices, and 
ever-greater energy imports, the groups wrote:  “Options such as expanded 
oil and gas drilling, 'clean' coal, and nuclear power are, at best, 
long-term strategies that will offer no immediate or even near-term relief 
from the energy problems now confronting the U.S.  Moreover, many of these 
technologies entail unacceptably high economic, social, and environmental 
costs that will limit, if not completely preclude, their use over the long 
term.

<p>“The only energy resources that can provide any significant relief, both now 
and in the years ahead, are the mix of energy efficiency and renewable 
energy technologies deployed to the maximum extent possible.  Therefore, the 
deep cuts being proposed by the White House in the U.S. Department of Energy 
and other federal agency budgets for these programs should be rejected 
out-of-hand.  Instead, Congress should not only restore program budgets for 
the core sustainable energy programs but also increase funding to the levels 
authorized by the recently-enacted Energy Policy Act of 2005.”

Washington, D.C.

<p>Dear Senator/Representative:

<p>We the undersigned business, environmental, consumer, energy policy, and 
other organizations are writing to urge you to reject the Administration's 
Fiscal Year 2007 budget request for the federal energy efficiency and 
renewable energy programs.

<p>For a host of reasons, the proposed cut-backs in the federal investment in 
sustainable energy research, development, deployment, and grants are 
illogical, irresponsible, and a strategic mistake that is totally 
unacceptable.

<p>Natural gas prices are at historic highs and unlikely to diminish anytime 
soon causing very serious problems for business and consumers alike.

<p>Oil prices remain above $60 a barrel and are projected by the Energy 
Information Administration to remain at least at those levels into the far 
foreseeable future.

<p>Petroleum and natural gas imports continue to climb upward contributing to 
record trade deficits while undermining the nation's security by increasing 
U.S. dependence on politically unstable energy-exporting countries.

<p>Climate change is worsening - apparently at an accelerating rate - with 2005 
being the warmest year on record and the United States continuing as the 
world's largest emitter of greenhouse gases.

<p>Options such as expanded oil and gas drilling, "clean" coal, and nuclear 
power are, at best, long-term strategies that will offer no immediate or 
even near-term relief from the energy problems now confronting the U.S.  
Moreover, many of these technologies entail unacceptably high economic, 
social, and environmental costs that will limit, if not completely preclude, 
their use over the long term.

<p>The only energy resources that can provide any significant relief, both now 
and in the years ahead, are the mix of energy efficiency and renewable 
energy technologies deployed to the maximum extent possible.

<p>Therefore, the deep cuts being proposed by the White House in the U.S. 
Department of Energy and other federal agency budgets for these programs 
should be rejected out-of-hand.

<p>Instead, Congress should not only restore program budgets for the core 
sustainable energy programs but also increase funding to the levels 
authorized by the recently-enacted Energy Policy Act of 2005.

<p>Furthermore, Congress should act to ensure that funds appropriated for 
energy efficiency and renewable energy programs are directed towards 
immediate deployment and near-term R&D rather than long-term, speculative 
research programs.  As part of this, emphasis should be given to reinforcing 
those state and local sustainable programs now in place that are 
successfully and effectively deploying these technologies -- possibly 
through expanded grants programs.

<p>Coupled with other efforts - such as extension and expansion of sustainable 
energy production and investment tax credits, government procurement, 
regulatory reform, and public education - adequate funding for, and proper 
design of, the federal sustainable energy program offers the best solution 
to the nation's energy woes.  In fact, it may offer the only viable 
solution.

<p>We look forward to working with you on this issue as you develop the FY'07 
budget in the weeks and months ahead.

<p>Sincerely,
