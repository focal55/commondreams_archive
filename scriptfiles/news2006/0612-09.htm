<p> WASHINGTON - June 12 - In a letter sent today to members of the House Ethics Committee, 
five reform groups strongly opposed ''the use of a pre-approval system by the 
House Ethics Committee as a basis for allowing private interests to continue to 
finance trips taken by members of Congress.''
<P align=left>The reform groups include Campaign Legal Center, Democracy 21, the 
League of Women Voters, Public Citizen and U.S. PIRG.</P>
<P align=left>A copy of the House Ethics Committee letter was sent to all House 
members.</P>
<P align=left>Instead of adopting ''any such procedures to deal with a 
fundamental House ethics problem,'' the reform groups urged the Committee ''to 
recommend an end to the serious abuses arising from privately-funded trips for 
Members.''</P>
<P align=left>According to the letter, ''The Committee could do this by 
endorsing the ban on privately-funded trips proposed by House Speaker Dennis 
Hastert (R-IL). Alternatively, the Committee could accomplish this by endorsing 
the restrictions on privately-funded trips contained in H.R. 4682, the lobbying 
and ethics bill introduced by House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA).''</P>
<P align=left>The letter states, ''We strongly oppose the use of pre-approval by 
the House Ethics Committee to legitimize privately-funded travel for two basic 
reasons.''</P>
<P align=left>According to the letter, ''First, pre-approval by the House Ethics 
Committee of privately-funded trips will not stop the widespread abuses that 
have occurred in the House as a result of private groups paying for trips by 
Members whose decisions and votes they are trying to influence. At the same time 
it will reduce a Member's own accountability for taking privately-funded 
trips.''</P>
<P align=left>The letter continues, ''Second, the House Ethics Committee has no 
public credibility. The Committee has failed to enforce even the limited 
existing House ethics rules governing travel, failed to investigate the Jack 
Abramoff lobbying scandals and failed to even function during most of this 
Congress.''</P>
<P align=left>The letter adds, ''There is no reason for the public to have any 
confidence in decisions by the House Ethics Committee about what is acceptable 
privately-funded travel, even if such a process was an effective way to end 
travel abuses by Members, which it is not.''</P>
<P align=left>The letter states, ''If members of Congress are traveling on 
official business for public purposes, it is the public that should pay for such 
trips, not private interests.''</P>
<P align=left>According to the letter, ''Citizens certainly understand why many 
private interests that lobby Congress are interested in paying for trips by 
Members, trips which are often made to luxurious and vacation-type settings in 
the United States and around the world.''</P>
<P align=left>The letter states, ''According to a recent study by the Center for 
Public Integrity, for example, during the period from January 2000 through June 
2005, members of Congress and their staffs received at least 200 
privately-funded trips to Paris, 150 to Hawaii and 140 to Italy.''</P>
<P align=left>The letter adds, ''Privately-funded trips give private interests 
the opportunity to provide substantial financial perks to Members, while also 
having the Members as a captive audience during the trips for access and 
lobbying purposes. And if private interests have company planes available to fly 
the Members on the trips, they gain sole access to Members, often for hours at a 
time.''</P>
<P align=left>The letter continues, ''According to an article in <EM>The 
Washington Post</EM> (June 6, 2006) reporting on the study by the Center for 
Public integrity, 'Over 5 1/2 years, Republican and Democratic lawmakers 
accepted nearly $50 million in trips, often to resorts and exclusive locales, 
from corporations and groups seeking legislative favors, according to the most 
comprehensive study to date on the subject of congressional travel.'''</P>
<P align=left>The letter further cites the <EM>Post</EM> article as stating, 
''From January 2000 through June 2005, House and Senate members and their aides 
were away from Washington for more than 81,000 days--a combined 222 years--on at 
least 23,000 trips, according to the report, issued yesterday by the nonpartisan 
Center for Public Integrity.''</P>
<P align=left>According to the letter, ''A list of the top House spenders on 
privately-funded trips, including their staffs, shows that the funders of these 
private trips are not providing them at random, but rather are focusing on the 
most influential members of the House.''</P>
<P align=left>The letter states, ''According to the Center for Public Integrity 
study, nine of the top eleven House spenders on privately-funded travel, 
including their staffs, included the House Speaker; the former House Majority 
Leader; the House Majority Whip; the former Chairman of the House Education and 
the Workforce Committee and current House Majority Leader; the Chairman of the 
House Ways and Means Committee; the Chairman of the House Energy Committee; the 
former Chairman of the House Energy Committee; the Chairman of the House 
Financial Services; and the Chairman of the House Transportation and 
Infrastructure Committee, who previously served as Chairman of the House 
Resources Committee.''</P>
<P align=left>The letter adds, ''There is no reason to believe that a system of 
pre-approval of privately-funded trips for Members is going to stop the 
vacation-type trips for Members to Paris, Hawaii, Italy and the like.''</P>
<P align=left>The letter continues, ''There is no reason to believe that a 
system of pre-approval of privately-funded trips for Members is going to stop 
private interests from using privately-funded trips to gain special access to 
and influence with Members, and in particular the most powerful members of the 
House.''</P>
<P align=left>The letter concludes, ''Our organizations strongly urge the House 
Ethics Committee not to establish a system of pre-approval for privately-funded 
travel by Members, and instead to recommend new House ethics rules to prevent 
private interests from funding trips for Members.''</P>
