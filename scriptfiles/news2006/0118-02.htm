<p>WASHINGTON - January 18 - CNN Headline News has hired radio talkshow host Glenn Beck to host a one-hour primetime show, according to a <span class="media_outlet">Daily Variety</span> report (1/17/05). Variety quotes <span class="media_outlet">CNN Headline News</span> president Ken Jautz's description of Beck: "Glenn&#8217;s style is self-deprecating, cordial; he says he'd like to be able to disagree with guests and part as friends. It's conversational, not confrontational." <br />

 <br />
But Glenn Beck&#8217;s hateful rhetoric tells a different story. <br />
 <br />
Beck, best known for setting up <span class="media_outlet">Clear Channel</span>'s pro-war Rallies for America shortly before the Iraq War, once described how much he loathed anti-war presidential candidate Dennis Kucinich (<span class="media_outlet">WABC-AM</span>, 3/16/03): "Every night I get down on my knees and pray that Dennis Kucinich will burst into flames." <br />
 <br />
In 2004, Beck called Michael Berg, whose son had been beheaded in Iraq, "despicable" and a "scumbag" because the elder Berg criticized George W. Bush in the wake of his son&#8217;s death. (Mediamatters.org, <a target="_blank" href="http://mediamatters.org/items/200405170002" title="">5/17/04</a>) <br />

 <br />
On May 17, 2005, Beck fantasized about murdering anti-war filmmaker Michael Moore (Mediamatters.org, <a target="_blank" href="http://mediamatters.org/items/200505180008" title="">5/18/05</a>): <br />
 <br />
<div class="sideindent">I'm thinking about killing Michael Moore, and I'm wondering if I could kill him myself, or if I would need to hire somebody to do it. No, I think I could. I think he could be looking me in the eye, you know, and I could just be choking the life out--is this wrong?</div> <br />
 <br />
Beck also accused Moore of "taking help and money from Hezbollah."<br />
 <br />

He wasn&#8217;t much more charitable to victims of Hurricane Katrina, some of whom he called "scumbags." On September 9, Beck said that Katrina victims caused a "near riot" when ATM cards were distributed to the displaced (Mediamatters.org, <a target="_blank" href="http://mediamatters.org/items/200509090003" title="">9/9/05</a>): <br />
 <br />
<div class="sideindent">When you are rioting for these tickets, or these ATM cards, the second thing that came to mind was--and this is horrible to say, and I wonder if I'm alone in this--you know it took me about a year to start hating the 9/11 victims' families? Took me about a year.... But the second thought I had when I saw these people and they had to shut down the Astrodome and lock it down, I thought: I didn't think I could hate victims faster than the 9/11 victims.... And that's all we're hearing about, are the people in New Orleans. Those are the only ones we're seeing on television are the scumbags--and again, it's not all the people in New Orleans. Most of the people in New Orleans got out! It's just a small percentage of those who were left in New Orleans, or who decided to stay in New Orleans, and they're getting all the attention.</div><br />
 <br />
In the same broadcast, he explained his animus against the relatives of September 11 victims (while maintaining that "of the 3,000 victims' families, I don't hate all of them. Probably about 10 of them"): "When I see a 9/11 victim family on television, or whatever, I'm just like, 'Oh shut up!' I'm so sick of them because they're always complaining. And we did our best for them." <br />
 <br />
The strategy of out-Foxing <span class="media_outlet"><a href="index.php?page=19&amp;media_outlet_id=2" title="">Fox</a></span> by signing up incendiary right-wing talkshow hosts is a dangerous one, as <span class="media_outlet">MSNBC</span> found when it gave a show to hate-radio star Michael Savage and had to let him go when it turned out that his TV persona spouted the same vitriol featured on his radio show (FAIR Action Alert, <a href="index.php?page=1621" title="">7/7/03</a>). <span class="media_outlet">Headline News</span> executives may put Glenn Beck on the air in spite of his hateful baggage, but they shouldn&#8217;t be surprised if he doesn&#8217;t turn out to be the "cordial" and tolerant host they are touting. <br />

 <br />
<b>ACTION:</b> Contact Ken Jautz and ask him to explain his characterization of Beck as "cordial." Ask him if <span class="media_outlet">CNN Headline News</span> supports the hateful and violent commentary Beck is known for.<br />
