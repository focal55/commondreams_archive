<p>WASHINGTON - October 6 - The Department of Energy's new efficiency standards for home furnaces and boilers are as weak as they are tardy, according to the Natural Resources Defense Council.</p>

<p>The proposed standards, which by law were due in 1994, will do little to save energy or cut costs for consumers, said Katherine Kennedy, an NRDC attorney.</p>

<p>&quot;This long-overdue proposal misses the opportunity to bring home heating into the 21st Century,&quot; Kennedy said. &quot;We need strong furnace and boiler standards to cut pollution and keep Americans warm -- without breaking the bank.&quot;</p>

<p>The only promising aspect of DOE's proposal is to grant states greater authority to set standards appropriate to their own climates, she said.</p>

<p>&quot;The best solution remains for DOE to issue stronger national furnace standards, and the department can still do that,&quot; Kennedy said. &quot;The next best solution, if the federal government refuses to lead, is to allow states to set tougher furnace efficiency standards that would lower energy bills and clean the air.&quot;</p>

<p>To date, three states -- Massachusetts, Rhode Island and Vermont -- have passed laws to set stronger standards than the one proposed today. But those laws cannot take effect without DOE authorization, a cumbersome process at best. Under today's DOE proposal, the department is signaling that it would make it easier for states to set their own, tougher standards.</p>

<p>The long-overdue DOE's furnace standards proposed today came in the wake of a September 2005 lawsuit filed by NRDC, 15 states and two consumer organizations. The still-pending lawsuit alleges that DOE has repeatedly ignored deadlines requiring them to set new efficiency performance standards for air conditioners, furnaces and 20 other types of power-hungry equipment.</p>

<p>More efficient standards, according to Kennedy, could reduce home-heating bills by 10% or more.</p>
