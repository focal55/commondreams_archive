<p>WASHINGTON - February 23 - Following repeated  attempts to receive answers from federal government officials as  to why basic health information for gay, lesbian, bisexual, and  transgender (GLBT) Americans was removed from a Department of  Health and Human Services Web site at the demands of an extremist  organization, Parents, Families and Friends of Lesbians and Gays  (PFLAG) praised Wisconsin Rep. Tammy Baldwin's swift move to  demand an explanation and correction to the situation.</p>
<p>   &quot;This shouldn't be about politics or fringe ideology. It  should be about the responsibility of the government to provide  complete, accurate and accessible health information that serves  all Americans effectively, including our GLBT loved ones,&quot; said  Jody M. Huckaby, PFLAG's executive director. &quot;HHS has removed  basic health information on one site at the demands of an  extremist group, and has completely omitted all content about  GLBT youth on another. This is outrageous and unacceptable. We're  proud of Rep. Baldwin's call to action on this matter of basic  fairness.&quot;</p>
<p>   The information currently in question was on the Substance  Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) Web  site. The agency had posted information regarding GLBT health and  issues, featuring PFLAG as one of the primary resources for  straight individuals who wanted to learn more about GLBT issues.</p>
<p>   In January 2006, the Family Research Council (FRC) issued a  letter to HHS Secretary Michael Leavitt, complaining that the Web  site was &quot;loaded with biased, politically-charged language, such  as condemnations of so-called 'homophobia,' 'heterosexism,' and  'sexual prejudice'&quot; and requesting a prompt response. </p>
<p>   They also asked members to contact the agency and complain  that it &quot;uses material from pro-homosexual activist groups such  as ... Parents, Families, and Friends of Lesbians and Gays  (PFLAG) ... &quot;</p>
<p>   Eleven days later, the site was removed and a letter sent to  FRC indicating that the content -- which had been up for six  years -- had been removed because it was not within the mission  of HHS, in spite of the fact that it addressed substance abuse  among GLBT populations in a user-friendly format.</p>
<p>   The Family Research Council immediately sent a message to its  supporters indicating that this was a victory, noting that they  were still upset that &quot;HHS became involved in promoting the  unhealthy homosexual lifestyle in the first place.&quot;</p>
<p>   PFLAG, who had met with HHS representatives in April of 2005  regarding incorrect health information on another of its Web  sites -- <a href="http://releases.usnewswire.com/redir.asp?ReleaseID=61404&Link=http://4parents.gov">http://4parents.gov</a> -- has contacted the agency  repeatedly asking for an explanation and received no response.  PFLAG joined with the Sexuality Information and Education Council  of the United States (SEICUS) -- who had also played an integral  role in the 4parents.gov investigation -- to collect images and  content of the removed pages.</p>
<p>   On Feb. 17, PFLAG contacted Rep. Baldwin about the issue and  she immediately took action, issuing a letter on Feb. 21 to  Michael Leavitt asking for an explanation for the action and  calling for the information to be restored on the Web site. The  letter is currently being circulated among her colleagues for  sign-on support.</p>
<p>   &quot;Government agencies are supposed to provide services and  accurate information to all people, not just a select few, and  not just the ones they deem acceptable,&quot; said Huckaby. &quot;The fact  that this agency so quickly and willingly gave in to the demands  of an extremist group who uses fringe religious bias and junk  science to advance their hurtful agenda is outrageous. We deserve  answers, and our GLBT families deserve the same resources as  everyone else.&quot;</p>
