<p>WASHINGTON - April 10 - “Today is a historic day. In an unprecedented mobilization sweeping the nation, over a million people are coming together in more than one hundred cities to call for a realistic solution to our broken immigration system.

<p>“This broad coaliton of labor, community, religious, student and other immigrant advocacy groups has united in a National Day of Action to urge Congress to pass comprehensive immigration reform that makes America more secure, protects all workers, and recognizes the important contribution of immigrants to our economy and American society as a whole.

<p>“While we come from a variety of backgrounds with different histories, we are all united by a simple belief: everyone who works hard in America should have the opportunity for a good job with a paycheck that supports a family, affordable health care and a secure retirement.

<p>“But our outdated immigration laws make it much harder for millions of people to achieve a better future for themselves and their families.

<p>“That’s why America is counting on its leaders in Congress to continue working together in a bipartisan fashion to get comprehensive immigration reform passed this year that respects this core value of rewarding hard work.

<p>“A comprehensive approach must include an earned path to citizenship for the hardworking, taxing paying immigrants already here. It must also establish a controlled, orderly process for coming to work in this country so we can channel immigrant workers through the American legal system. This will in turn enhance our security by allowing our border patrol to focus on those who come to this country to do us harm.

<p>“Today’s extraordinary mobilization is just the beginning. We will continue to march and speak out until the President signs a comprehensive immigration bill into law that works for all working people in this country. And if Congress fails to act, we will deliver our message in the ballot boxes come November.”
