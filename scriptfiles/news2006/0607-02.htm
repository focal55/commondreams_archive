<p>WASHINGTON - June 7 - Following the U.S. Senate's  vote on the Federal Marriage Amendment (SJR 1), Jody M. Huckaby,  executive director of Parents, Families and Friends of Lesbians and  Gays (PFLAG), which represents more than 200,000 members and  supporters in all 50 states, issued the following statement:</p>
<p>   &quot;This whole ordeal provided us with some great statistics.</p>
<p>   &quot;Forty-nine of our elected leaders voted to support legislation  that would write discrimination against our loved ones into the  Constitution. These people would deny gays and lesbians basic rights  like healthcare and hospital visitation. Without a shred of credible  evidence, they shamefully concluded that 'traditional' marriages  would be torn apart if we were to grant all Americans equal rights,  and used this as their justification for their extreme position.</p>
<p>   &quot;On the other hand, 48 of our legislators displayed great courage  and wisdom in opposing the Federal Marriage Amendment. Whether they  voted no because they believe that this bill is discriminatory, or  because they believe that this should be left to the states and not  a federal mandate, or because they believe this to be a deeply  misplaced priority, they have made a tremendous statement. Their  votes prove that this political pandering will not be tolerated.</p>
<p>   &quot;Over the course of the last three days, the U.S. Senate has  wasted nearly 20 hours debating a bill that would make the  Constitution a license for discrimination against the millions of  gay and lesbian Americans. During this time, they could have been  discussing issues that matter to all Americans -- the war in Iraq,   immigration, rising fuel costs, and adequate funding for education,  to name a few -- but they chose to appeal to extreme factions and  carry out the demands of vocal constituents who would forever change  the face of the Constitution.&quot;</p>
<p>   Editors/Reporters: PFLAG leaders and members throughout the U.S.  are available for comment on this issue. Contact Jean-Marie Navetta  to get more information.</p>
