<p>CARACAS, Venezuela - January 26 - Today, the Poor Peoples Economic Human Rights Campaign, a Philadelphia-based organization comprised of poor and homeless families, will announce plans to take a group of families from poor neighbors of the United States to meet with residents of Venezuela’s poorest barrios.  The meeting, which will be televised on Venezuelan TV, is part of an unprecedented effort to unite the voices of the world’s poor and homeless in demanding economic human rights.  

 

<p>According to Cheri Honkola, Poor Peoples Economic Human Rights Campaign National Coordinator, "This meeting of poor people from the United States and poor people from a major Latin American city is a landmark in what we hope will become a global campaign to highlight economic deprivation around the world.”

 

<p>The Poor People's Economic Human Right's Campaign is committed to uniting the poor across national boundaries as the leadership base for a broad movement to abolish poverty. They work to accomplish this through advancing economic human rights named in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights- such as the rights to food, housing, health, education, communication and a living wage job.
