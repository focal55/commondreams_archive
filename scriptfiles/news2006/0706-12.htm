<p>WASHINGTON - July 5 - 

	

    The Washington Post reported today that North Korea's missile 
testing prompted "a hastily called session of the UN Security Council 
after the Stalinist state unnerved the region."
<p>The Associated Press reported on June 14: "The Air Force 
successfully tested an unarmed Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic 
missile early Wednesday, officials said. The missile traveled 4,800 
miles in about 30 minutes before its three warheads struck targets at 
the Kwajalein Missile Range in the western chain of the Marshall Islands 
[in the Pacific]..."

    President of the GRACE Policy Institute, which works on issues of 
nuclear power and the environment, Slater said today: "We are reaping 
the whirlwind when the North Korean government launches this shocking 
series of missile firings. The U.S. has been hurling missiles over the 
Pacific, most recently in June, after the Korean threat was reported as 
a 'provocation' to U.S. interests. Russia is getting into the act, too, 
having launched a ballistic missile on June 29, from a submarine in the 
Barents Sea, at a target nearly 4,000 miles away in the Pacific. It is 
folly to think we can tell North Korea what to do, when we are unwilling 
to restrain our own missile testing.
<p> "We ought to be negotiating a treaty to ban all missiles. Instead, 
the Bush administration has pulled out of the Anti-Ballistic Missile 
Treaty, an agreement we had with Russia not to provoke a missile arms 
race, brazenly asserting our U.S. right to 'dominate and control the 
military use of space,' proclaimed in the mission statement of the U.S. 
Space Command."

    Author of the book "The U.N. For Beginners," Williams said today: 
"The manner in which the Security Council is dealing with Israel and 
North Korea is quite an interesting exercise in hypocrisy."
<p>"Israel has just announced it's moving into civilian areas [in 
Gaza], and was already in egregious violation of international law and a 
multitude of UN Security Council resolutions. It has ripped up the 'Road 
  Map' and, despite occasional hot air from ambassadors, the U.S. 
government has made sure nothing is done about it.
<p>"Meanwhile, whatever you may think of the provocative...actions of 
the North Korean government, it is not violating any international 
statute -- there is no treaty governing missile launches -- but there is 
a rush to put the issue on the Council agenda."

    Weisbrot is co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy 
Research and has written extensively on Latin America. The group issued 
a statement this morning: "The credibility of Mexico's electoral process 
was thrown into question on Tuesday morning when the head of Mexico's 
Federal Electoral Institute, Luis Carlos Ugalde, acknowledged that as 
many as 4 million votes had not been counted in the preliminary vote 
count that began after the polls closed on Sunday."
<p>Said Weisbrot: "[Felipe] Calderon's lead in the preliminary vote 
count appears to be statistically meaningless, since the excluded votes 
are more than 10 times as large as his margin over Lopez Obrador. ... 
Why didn't the Federal Electoral Institute inform the public about the 
more than 3 million votes not included in the preliminary vote count 
until about a day and a half had passed and only after the PRD 
[Democratic Revolution Party] had raised the issue of '3 million missing 
votes.'"
