<p>WASHINGTON - April 13 - Following is a  statement on Wal-Mart CEO Lee Scott's &quot;Month Long Vacation&quot; by  Paul Blank, campaign director, WakeUpWalMart.com:</p>
<p>   At a time when Wal-Mart is attempting to repair a faltering  public image, reverse sluggish store sales, and minimize the in- store damage from a collapse in worker morale, it is extremely  odd and very unusual for Wal-Mart's CEO Lee Scott to take a  &quot;month long vacation.&quot; Scott's &quot;vacation&quot; raises serious  questions about whether or not this is the beginning of the end  for Mr. Scott's troubled tenure as Wal-Mart's CEO.</p>
<p>   Above all, whether Lee Scott stays as CEO or is replaced by  another Wal-Mart executive, like John Menzer or Eduardo Castro  Wright, we remain hopeful Wal-Mart will realize it cannot solve  its public relations quagmire simply by changing the leadership  at the top. Only real change, which improves the lives of their  workers and their families, can salvage Wal-Mart's faltering  public image.</p>
<p>   As we have said in the past, we are willing to work together  with Wal-Mart - no matter who is the CEO - to improve the lives  of its workers and to make Wal-Mart a better and more successful  company.</span></p>
