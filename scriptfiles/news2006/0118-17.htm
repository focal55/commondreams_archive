<p>WASHINGTON - January 18 - The American Civil Liberties Union and Planned 
Parenthood Federation of America (PPFA) welcomed today's decision by the U.S. 
Supreme Court in <EM>Ayotte v. Planned Parenthood of Northern New England, et al,</EM> 
which unanimously recognized its precedent that abortion laws must protect 
women's health and safety.<BR><BR>
"Today's decision tells politicians that 
they cannot jeopardize women's health when they pass abortion laws," said 
Jennifer Dalven, Deputy Director of the ACLU's Reproductive Freedom Project, and 
the attorney who argued Ayotte before the Court. <BR>
<BR>The case began as 
a challenge to a New Hampshire law that prevents doctors from performing an 
abortion for a teenager under the age of 18 until 48 hours after a parent has 
been notified. Contrary to 30 years of Supreme Court precedent, the law 
contained no medical emergency exception to protect a pregnant teenager's 
health. The lower courts struck down the law because of this 
omission. <BR><BR>"We are relieved that the Supreme Court left in 
place protections for women's health and safety in abortion laws," said PPFA 
Interim President Karen Pearl. "We continue to believe that the law should be 
struck down by the lower court."<BR><BR>The Supreme Court asked the lower 
court to consider whether the New Hampshire legislature would have wanted this 
law with a medical emergency exception. If not, the Court said the law 
should be struck down in its entirety. <BR><BR>"The New Hampshire 
legislature intentionally omitted a medical emergency exception when it passed 
this law," Dalven said. "We continue to believe that the lower court will 
recognize this and strike down the law in its entirety."<BR><BR>New 
Hampshire abortion clinics and providers who brought the legal challenge are 
Planned Parenthood of Northern New England, the Concord Feminist Health Center, 
the Feminist Health Center of Portsmouth, and Wayne Goldner, 
M.D.<BR><BR>Attorneys for the respondents include Dalven, Steven R. 
Shapiro, Louise Melling, Talcott Camp, Corinne Schiff, Brigitte Amiri, and Diana 
Kasdan of the ACLU; Dara Klassel of Planned Parenthood Federation of America; 
Martin P. Honigberg of Sulloway &amp; Hollis, PLLC; and Lawrence Vogelman, of 
Nixon Raiche Manning Vogelman &amp; Leach, PA and legal director of the New 
Hampshire Civil Liberties Union.<BR><BR>For more information, go to: <A class=noline_blue href="http://www.ayottevplannedparenthood.org./">www.ayottevplannedparenthood.org</A>.
