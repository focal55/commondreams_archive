<p>GENEVA / BRUSSELS - February 8 - The Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy, Friends of the Earth Europe and
Greenpeace have made the conclusions of the WTO dispute on genetically
modified organisms public [1] in order to allow the whole world to
engage in the debate on the future of our food.

<p>The groups condemned the secrecy of the WTO and called on governments to
ensure that complex health and environmental decisions are taken in a
transparent manner by bodies qualified to do so.

<p>"This verdict only proves that the WTO is unqualified to deal with
complex scientific and environmental issues. They even say so
themselves, claiming that ‘the panel did not examine ... whether biotech
products in general are safe or not’. The US administration and
agro-chemical companies brought the case in a desperate attempt to
force-feed markets with GMOs. But consumers, citizens and farmers around
the world do not want GMOs and this ruling will change none of that,"
said Daniel Mittler, Trade Policy Advisor at Greenpeace International.

<p>"The WTO is keeping its draft ruling secret. This sums up everything
that is wrong with the WTO. It is secretive, undemocratic and biased
towards business interests. The WTO should be the last institution to
decide what people eat and grow in the fields," said Alexandra Wandel,
Trade Coordinator at Friends of the Earth Europe.

<p>"The WTO dispute panel is set up to view regulations strictly in a
framework designed to facilitate trade, not to realize public or
environmental health objectives," said Steve Suppan, Senior Trade
Associate at the Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy. "The U.S.
government and the biotech companies may claim that the ruling proves
that GE crops are safe for human consumption and the use of GE seeds is
an environmentally beneficial agricultural practice. But the case covers
no such thing: much less does it support the profoundly flawed U.S.
regulation of GE crops."
