WASHINGTON - July 8 - 

 The Green Party's National Committee has endorsed the <a href="http://www.votersforpeace.us" target="_new">VotersForPeace pledge</a>, a national effort to organize the emerging 'Peace Vote' as a voting block with the power to determine the outcome of elections.

<p>The pledge reads "I will not vote for or support any candidate for Congress or President who does not make a speedy end to the war in Iraq, and preventing any future war of aggression, a public position in his or her campaign."

<p>"We encourage all voters who agree that U.S. troops must be withdrawn from Iraq to sign the VotersForPeace pledge," said <a href="http://www.voterae.org" target="_new">Rae Vogeler</a>, Wisconsin Green candidate for the U.S. Senate. "The only way to stop the war is to get Democratic and Republican warhawks out of office."

<p>"The Green Party and the 'Peace Slate' of Green candidates have consistently opposed the invasion and occupation since the beginning, and have criticized President Bush's threats of a military assault against Iran. In many elections, the Green is the only candidate running who calls for immediate troop withdrawal," Ms. Vogeler added.

<p>Greens have expressed dismay at Congress's refusal, in recent House and Senate votes, to set even a tentative deadline for the withdrawal of American troops, and blamed Democrats and Republicans who voted to defeat the proposals.

<p>When VotersForPeace.US was launched on March 17, 2006, the first signer was <a href="http://www.bergforcongress.us" target="_new">Michael Berg</a>, whose son Nick was taken hostage in Iraq and killed in May, 2004. Mr. Berg is currently running as the Delaware Green candidate for the U.S. House of Representatives. 

<p><a href="http://www.kevinzeese.com" target="_new">Kevin Zeese</a>, candidate on the Green ticket for U.S. Senator from Maryland and director of <a href="http://www.democracyrising.us" target="_new">DemocracyRising.US</a>, is co-founder of VotersForPeace. VotersForPeace itself is nonprofit and nonpartisan, and does not endorse candidates.

<p>Green Party members joined various antiwar events during the July 4th holiday. Greens support the 'Troops Home Fast' organized by CodePink, which is taking place in front of the White House until August 14. On August 14, the fast will move to Camp Casey in Crawford, Texas, where it will continue. Party members also support U.S. Army First Lieutenant Ehren K. Watada, who recently refused orders to fly to Iraq, on the grounds that the war and occupation in Iraq are illegal.

<p>The Green Party will hold its 2006 national meeting, titled "<a href="http://www.gp.org/meeting2006" target="_new">El Futuro es Verde / The Future is Green</a>," in Tucson, Arizona, from July 27 to 30.
