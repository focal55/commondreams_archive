<p>WASHINGTON - APRIL 25 - Today, April 25, is Equal Pay Day -- the day when women's average 
            earnings finally catch up with the amount men earned on average in 
            the previous calendar year alone. At our founding in 1966, the 
            National Organization for Women identified the wage gap and its 
            negative impact on women. Forty years later, the gap remains wide 
            and progress has slowed to a crawl. Now, women working full-time, 
            year-round, are paid only about three-quarters as much as men, and 
African-American women and Latinas receive even less. 
<P>Women are still not receiving equal pay for equal work, let alone 
            equal pay for work of equal value. According to data from the 
            Department of Labor, women are paid less than men in every 
            occupation for which sufficient information is available -- more 
            than 300 job classifications. This disparity not only affects 
            women's day-to-day spending power; it also affects their retirement 
            by penalizing them through gaps in social security and pensions. In 
            spite of the passage of the Equal Pay Act in 1963, the pay gap 
            remains, having closed by an average of less than half a penny per 
            year since the act was passed. </P>
            <P>That is why NOW proudly joins with the WAGE (Women Are Getting 
            Even) Project and other women's rights allies in launching WAGE 
            Clubs -- an exciting new nationwide grassroots movement forged to 
            help grow women's wages. WAGE clubs will provide women with a forum 
            where they can discuss wage discrimination and strategize about how 
            to right this wrong.</P>
            <P>If women were paid as much as men who work the same number of 
            hours, have the same education and union status, are the same age, 
            and live in the same region of the country, then women's annual 
            income would rise by $4,000 and poverty rates would be cut in half. 
            Working families would gain an astounding $200 billion in family 
            income annually. </P>
            <P>"It is shameful that, in the United States of America, women are 
            paid so much less than men - and that that there is so little 
            political will to deal with the disparity," said NOW President Kim 
            Gandy. "These inequities are injuring women and our families. Both 
            employers and politicians are way past due in demonstrating that 
            they value women's contributions as much as they value men's." </P>
