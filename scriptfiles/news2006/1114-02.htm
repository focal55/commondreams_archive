<p>CORNUCOPIA, Wisconsin - November 14 - The Cornucopia  Institute, the nation's most aggressive organic farming watchdog,  has filed a formal legal complaint with the USDA asking them to  investigate allegations of illegal &quot;organic&quot; food distribution by  Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.  Cornucopia has documented cases of  nonorganic food products being sold as organic in Wal-Mart's  grocery departments.</p>
<p>   &quot;We first noticed that Wal-Mart was using in-store signage to  misidentify conventional, nonorganic food as organic in their  upscale-market test store in Plano, Texas,&quot; said Mark Kastel of  The Cornucopia Institute.  Subsequently, Cornucopia staff visited  a number of other Wal-Mart stores in the Midwest and documented  similar improprieties in both produce and dairy sections.</p>
<p>   Cornucopia notified Wal-Mart's CEO Lee Scott in a letter on  Sept. 13, 2006, alerting the company to the problem and asking  that it address and correct the situation on an immediate basis.   But the same product misrepresentations were again observed weeks  later at separate Wal-Mart stores.  Fines of up to $10,000 per  violation for proven incidents of organic food misrepresentation  are provided for in federal organic regulations.</p>
<p>   Earlier this year, Wal-Mart announced a sweeping organic foods  initiative and declared that they would greatly increase the  number of organic offerings for sale in their stores — at  dramatically lower prices than the competition.  The move by the  giant retailer has been under close scrutiny from members of the  organic community.</p>
<p>   &quot;This is disturbing and a serious problem,&quot; Kastel said.  &quot;One  can question whether Wal-Mart has the management and staff  expertise necessary to fully understand organics and the marketing  requirements essential to selling organic food.  Given their size,  market power, and market clout, this is very troubling.&quot;</p>
<p>   A number of other organic food retailers throughout the  country, including Whole Foods Markets and many of the nation's  member-owned grocery cooperatives, have gone to the effort to  become certified organic in terms of the handling of their  products and have invested heavily in staff training.</p>
<p>   This past September, The Cornucopia Institute also issued a  white paper, &quot;Wal-Mart Rolls Out Organic Products — Market  Expansion or Market Delusion?&quot;  The report accuses Wal-Mart of  cheapening the value of the organic label by sourcing products  from industrial-scale factory-farms and Third World countries,  such as China.</p>
