<p>WASHINGTON - January 23 - 
<p><b>WHO:</b> The Pledge of Resistance-Baltimore was formed for individuals willing to engage in nonviolent resistance to protest an invasion of Iraq. As part of its activities, the Pledge has tried to meet with the director of the National Security Agency to discuss its involvement in the war in Iraq.  On June 27, 2005, for example, the Pledge sent a letter to the interim NSA director, William B. Black, Jr., seeking a meeting.   Instead of meeting with the Pledge, the NSA treats the nonviolent activists as a “threat” and through the Maryland Terrorism Task Force illegally monitors Pledge activities.

 

<p><b>WHAT:</b> Mr. Black failed to respond to the letter, so eight Pledge activists visited Fort Meade on July 2, 2005.  Carrying cookies and hot and cold drinks for the NSA security forces, they walked from the Cryptologic Museum parking lot to a guard station.  The cookies and drinks were offered to NSA police officials. Then Pledge members indicated the group was there seeking a meeting with Mr. Black to discuss concerns related to Agency operations.  

 

<p>Security officials told the group to go to the visitor’s parking lot to await a meeting with an NSA representative.  Most of the group went to the parking area, but Ellen Barfield and Max Obuszewski decided to wait by the guard station for someone in authority. However, they were arrested and charged with Disturbance on Protected Property and are now scheduled for trial.

 

<p><b>WHEN:</b> Wednesday, January 25, 2005 at 10 AM


 

<p><b>WHERE:</b> U.S. District Court, 101 W. Lombard St., Baltimore 21201   before Magistrate Judge Beth Gesner 

 

<p><b>WHY: </b>It is assumed that the super-secret National Security Agency, which eavesdrops on communications worldwide as part of U.S. spying operations, fears having a meeting with citizen activists who will denounce its illegal operations. These are the concerns mentioned in the Pledge letter: “the role the NSA played in eavesdropping on members of the United Nations Security Council during the debate on attacking Iraq; John Bolton’s request for transcripts of intercepted conversations of many prominent politicians; the Agency’s role in spying on the Pledge of Resistance; and its refusal to release documents on the Pledge, as part of a FOIA request, without being paid a fee of $1915.” 

 

<p>Despite its illegal activities, the NSA will be visited by George W. Bush on Wednesday, January 25.  Presumably, he will order them to continue to spy on U.S. citizens.

 

<p>While Bush is visiting the NSA, Barfield and Obuszewski will try to put the Puzzle Palace on trial.  It is fitting that one of the prosecutors is an NSA attorney.  The Pledge of Resistance-Baltimore remains resolved in speaking out against an agency which is spying on U.S. citizens and monitoring a Baltimore peace group involved in Constitutionally-protected activities.
