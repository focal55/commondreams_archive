<p>PARIS - March 3 - European governments are turning a blind eye to the daily destruction of vulnerable deep-sea marine life by unregulated fishing vessels flying under European flags, according to a new Greenpeace report released today. <br>
<br>
"Murky Waters: hauling in the net on Europe's high seas bottom trawling
fleet"</a> documents the destructive activities of high seas bottom
trawlers observed fishing in the North Atlantic by Greenpeace in 2004
and 2005.<br>
Several of the vessels had been cited breaking the few rules that do
exist in these fisheries, yet all continued to fish. All of the vessels
observed were either owned by European nationals or fly the flags of
European states.<br>
<br>
High seas bottom trawling is recognised as the most destructive of all
fishing methods. Using weighted nets, which are dragged across the
ocean floor to catch and crush everything in their path, the practice
leaves valuable marine habitats as wastelands and devastates
vulnerable, slow-growing deep-sea fish stocks.<br>
<br>
According to the Greenpeace report, only a few hundred ships are
responsible for devastating huge areas of the world's oceans, with 60%
of these vessels flagged to EU Member States, principally Spain,
Denmark and France.<br>
<br>
"European interests are fuelling what is recognized as one of the
greatest threats to marine life: unregulated high seas bottom trawling"
said Greenpeace oceans campaigner, Sari Tolvanen, of Greenpeace. "The
report shows that Europe is a leading deep-sea destroyer. This can and
must change.<br>
European governments hold the key to the protection of deep-sea life:
by supporting a United Nations moratorium on high seas bottom trawling
these countries could ensure that these rich ecosystems are saved from
ruin. The economic cost of a moratorium on high seas bottom trawling
would be negligible compared to the protection provided to deep-sea
life - which is priceless."<br>
<br>
The Report coincides with the ministerial-level OECD Task Force meeting
on high seas illegal, unregulated and unreported (IUU) fishing, which
is due to reveal how it plans to further discuss the problem of pirate
fishing.<br>
<br>
Just last month, the 25 states that make up the European Union stood up
at the United Nations and said that urgent action was needed to combat
two of the biggest threats to marine life: destructive deep-sea fishing
and illegal fishing. "Words are fine, but action is better," said Remi
Parmentier of the Deep Sea Conservation Coalition, a consortium of more
than 50 NGOs worldwide set up to promote a UN high seas bottom trawling
moratorium. "The EU must now put its money where its mouth is and
immediately announce that it will support the proposed United Nations
General Assembly moratorium on high seas bottom trawling."<br>
<br>
"The unregulated bottom trawlers exposed in the Greenpeace Report are
just one facet of a broader picture of destruction spanning all of the
world's oceans. All of it leads back to the failure of governments to
act effectively to regulate illegal fishing," said Tolvanen of
Greenpeace.<br>
<br>
Earlier this week the Greenpeace ship Esperanza, set sail from Cape
Town, South Africa as part of the year-long 'Defending Our Oceans
Expedition' to highlight the threats to the oceans and demand that 40%
be declared no-take marine reserves, to safeguard marine life. Over the
next few months, in partnership with the Environmental Justice
Foundation, the Esperanza will expose how fishing pirates in the
Atlantic are wiping out marine life and destroying the livelihoods of
the communities dependent on our oceans for food.<br>
