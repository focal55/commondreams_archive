<p>WASHINGTON - August 16 - <b><a href="mailto:craigjmurray@tiscali.co.uk"><br>
<br>
CRAIG MURRAY</a></b><br />
Former ambassador from the UK to Uzbekistan, Murray wrote in a recent piece titled "The UK Terror Plot: What's Really Going On?" that: "None of the alleged terrorists had made a bomb. None had bought a plane ticket. Many did not even have passports, which given the efficiency of the UK Passport Agency would mean they couldn't be a plane bomber for quite some time."<br />
<br />
Murray also wrote: "In all of this, the one thing of which I am certain is that the timing is deeply political. This is more propaganda than plot. ... Be skeptical. Be very, very skeptical."<br />

Author of the book <i>The Newest Explosions of Terrorism</i>, Grosscup said today: "Of course it is playing politics with terrorism ... to what end? Bush/Blair could have the political results of a 9/11 without an actual event -- using the fear of a catastrophic event to (1) ... change the very nature of our society to a more authoritarian 'democracy'; (2) test how cowed the British/U.S. public is by the terrorism/national security issue; (3) focus attention back on their 'war on terror' and how effective they are being at getting an enemy that is still out there and away from their Iraq fiasco which is hurting their political prospects and their allies; (4) remind us all that this is a long permanent situation that requires 'special warfare' tactics at home and abroad to which there should be no objection."<br />

<br />
Grosscup is professor of international relations at California State University in Chico and author of the forthcoming book <i>Strategic Terror: The Politics and Ethics of Aerial Bombardment</i>.<!-- #EndEditable -->
