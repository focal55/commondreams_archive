<p>WASHINGTON - November 8 - The U.S. Supreme Court will hear argument 
today in two legal challenges to a federal ban on abortion.&nbsp; The American 
Civil Liberties Union and the National Abortion Federation (NAF) submitted 
friend-of-the-court briefs in each of the cases.&nbsp; Both organizations have 
called on the Court to hold women&#8217;s health paramount by affirming lower court 
decisions striking down the ban. 
<P></P>
<P>&#8220;This is a dangerous and broad ban prohibiting abortions as early as 13 weeks 
in pregnancy &#8211; abortions that doctors say are safe and among the best to protect 
women&#8217;s health,&#8221; said Vicki Saporta, NAF President and CEO. &#8220;Politicians should 
not legislate medical decision-making; women should be able to make decisions 
and receive care based on their individual circumstances.&#8221; <BR>&nbsp;<BR>Before 
the Court today are two challenges to the federal abortion ban, called the 
&#8220;Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act&#8221; by its sponsors: <EM>Gonzales v. Carhart</EM>, brought 
by the Center for Reproductive Rights on behalf of Dr. LeRoy Carhart and three 
other physicians and decided by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit 
in July 2005, and <EM>Gonzales v. Planned Parenthood Federation of America</EM>, brought 
by Planned Parenthood Federation of America on behalf of its affiliates 
throughout the country and decided by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth 
Circuit in October 2005. Both circuit courts struck down the ban because it 
fails to protect women&#8217;s health.&nbsp; In addition, the Ninth Circuit found that 
the ban prohibits an array of safe abortion methods. <BR>&nbsp;<BR>A third 
challenge to the federal abortion ban, <EM>NAF v. Gonzales</EM>, was brought by NAF and 
seven individual physicians, represented by the ACLU, Wilmer Cutler Pickering 
Hale and Dorr LLP, the ACLU of Illinois, and the New York Civil Liberties Union. 
In January 2006, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed that 
the ban requires a health exception and asked for further legal briefing to 
determine how to remedy the violation. That case is now on hold as the other two 
cases go before the Supreme Court. <BR>&nbsp;<BR>&#8220;Only six years ago, the 
Supreme court struck down a nearly identical ban because it endangered women,&#8221; 
said Louise Melling, Director of the ACLU Reproductive Freedom Project. &#8220;We are 
hopeful the Court will follow its own lead and stop this sweeping ban.&#8221; 
<BR>&nbsp;<BR>Medical groups, including the American College of Obstetricians 
and Gynecologists, oppose the federal ban. <BR>&nbsp;<BR>Congress passed the 
federal ban and President Bush signed it into law in 2003, despite numerous 
court decisions striking down similar state bans, including the decision in 2000 
by the Supreme Court in Stenberg v. Carhart. Courts have consistently struck 
down the bans for two reasons: their broad language prohibits abortions as early 
as 13 weeks in pregnancy, and they lack exceptions to protect women&#8217;s health. 
<BR>&nbsp;<BR>Today&#8217;s cases are <EM>Gonzales v. Planned Parenthood Federation of 
America</EM>, No. 05-1382 and <EM>Gonzales v. Car</EM>hart, No. 05-380.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>NAF is 
the professional association of abortion providers in the United States and 
Canada. NAF members care for more than half the women who choose abortion each 
year in the United States and work at clinics, doctors&#8217; offices, and hospitals 
throughout the country, including premier teaching hospitals. <BR>&nbsp;<BR>The 
ACLU is our nation&#8217;s guardian of liberty, working daily in courts, legislatures 
and communities to defend and preserve the individual rights and liberties 
guaranteed to every person in this country by the Constitution and laws of the 
United States.&nbsp; The NYCLU is the New York affiliate of the 
ACLU.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>For more information, visit: <A class=noline_blue href="http://www.aclu.org/reproductiverights">www.aclu.org/reproductiverights</A>
