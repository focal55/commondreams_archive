<p>BOSTON - October 5  - September 30, 2006 marked three decades of discrimination by government health programs against low-income women seeking abortion care.  Just three years after Roe v. Wade, Congress passed the Hyde Amendment, which prohibits federal Medicaid dollars from being used to pay for abortion, except in cases of rape, incest and danger to the life of the woman.  As Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall noted in 1980, in his dissent to the Court’s decision upholding the Amendment, “[F]or women eligible for Medicaid – poor women – denial of a Medicaid-funded abortion is equivalent to denial of legal abortion altogether.  By definition, these women do not have the money to pay for an abortion themselves.”

<p>The National Network of Abortion Funds (NNAF), an association of grassroots groups that helps low-income women to pay for abortions, has joined with allies nationwide to launch the Hyde – 30 Years is Enough! Campaign.  The campaign is raising money to help women harmed by the Hyde Amendment and advocating for expanded public funding of abortion, comprehensive health care for all and support for low-income women to care for their families with dignity.

<p>“All women must have the power and resources to make healthy decisions about their bodies and their families,” said Stephanie Poggi, Executive Director of NNAF.  “The Hyde Amendment deprives thousands of poor women, women of color and young women of this right.”

<p>Since 1976, most states have also banned state Medicaid funding for abortion, and Congress has severely restricted abortion funding in virtually every federal program, including health programs for military personnel and their families, disabled women and women receiving care from Indian Health Services. 

<p>For the more than 12 million women who depend on Medicaid and other federal programs, the impact of the Hyde Amendment and state funding bans is staggering.  When Medicaid covered abortion nationally, it paid for fully one-third of all abortions.  Since the Hyde Amendment took away abortion coverage, federal Medicaid has paid for less than one percent of abortions.

<p>“At an average of $468, the cost of a first-trimester abortion can be more than half of what a poverty-level family lives on in a month,” noted Toni Bond, Board President of NNAF and President/CEO of African American Women Evolving.  “So women have very little choice -- they have to use money needed for food, rent and other necessities to pay for abortion care.  Women who are trying to make the best decision for themselves and their families are sometimes forced to continue the pregnancy, abandon school and stay trapped in poverty.”  

<p>The Hyde - 30 Years is Enough! Coalition includes groups working on reproductive rights, health care access, social justice and human rights.  The full list of participating organizations and campaign activities can be found at www.hyde30years.nnaf.org. 

<p>The National Network of Abortion Funds is a coalition of over 100 community-based groups in 42 states that offer financial assistance to low-income women seeking abortions.  Each year, member groups of the Network raise over $2 million and help more than 20,000 women and girls nationwide, but we cannot meet the enormous gap created by the Hyde Amendment.  NNAF provides support and training to its member funds and advocates for a humane future where public funding of abortion – and all reproductive health care – is a reality.
