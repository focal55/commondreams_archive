<p>WASHINGTON - June 26 - The following is a  statement by Democracy 21 President Fred Wertheimer on the  Federal Election Commission: </p>
<p>   Democracy 21 strongly endorses the legislation introduced in  the Senate by Senators John McCain (R-AZ) and Russell Feingold  (D-WI) and in the House by Representatives Christopher Shays (R- CT) and Marty Meehan (D-MA) to replace the Federal Election  Commission (FEC) with a new agency to enforce the nation's  campaign finance laws. The bill was introduced last Thursday.</p>
<p>   A summary of the legislation and a summary of the principal  differences between the proposed new agency and the FEC are set  forth below.</p>
<p>   The FEC is a failed agency.</p>
<p>   It also is a captive agency.</p>
<p>   Washington Post columnist David Broder has described the FEC  as an agency &quot;whose six members are famously responsive to the  members of Congress who put them in their jobs.&quot;</p>
<p>   The failure of the FEC to do its job is illustrated by the  agency's central role in creating the soft money system, which  turned into a $500 million national scandal ended by Congress in  2002 when it banned soft money; in issuing flawed regulations  that opened new soft money loopholes in the 2002 law banning soft  money, which were overturned by the courts; and in allowing 527  groups to become a vehicle for circumventing the soft money ban,  an FEC decision which has been challenged by a court decision.</p>
<p>   The Supreme Court in upholding the 2002 law banning soft money  strongly admonished the FEC for having &quot;subverted&quot; and &quot;invited  widespread circumvention&quot; of the 1974 campaign finance laws by  creating the soft money system in the first place.</p>
<p>   This did not stop the FEC, however, from repeating history by  adopting a number of regulations that opened new soft money  loopholes in the 2002 law banning soft money.</p>
<p>   It took rulings by a federal district court judge and the D.C.  Circuit Court of Appeals to overturn the numerous loophole- opening regulations issued by the FEC to implement the soft money  ban.</p>
<p>   Federal district court judge Kollar-Kotelly found, for  example, in striking fifteen FEC soft money regulations as  contrary to law, that one of the FEC regulations &quot;runs completely  afoul&quot; of basic campaign finance law and &quot;would create an immense  loophole,&quot; that another &quot;severely undermines FECA&quot; and would  &quot;foster corruption,&quot; that another &quot;would render the statute  largely meaningless&quot; and that yet another has &quot;no rational  basis.&quot;</p>
<p>   Judge Kollar-Kotelly also rebuked the FEC for acting as a  &quot;super-legislature disregarding congressional intent.&quot;</p>
<p>   The D.C. Circuit Court found that the Commission's regulations  in one area &quot;fly in the face of (Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act's  (BCRA)) purpose because they reopen the very loophole the terms  were designed to close,&quot; and called one of the FEC's regulations  an &quot;absurdity.&quot; The Circuit Court further stated, &quot;Whereas BCRA  aims to shut down the soft money system, the Commission's rules  allow parties and politicians to perpetuate it ...&quot;</p>
<p>   The case against the FEC for failing to properly enforce the  laws is overwhelming.</p>
<p>   The need for a new enforcement body is equally clear.</p>
<p>   The legislation introduced last week by Senators McCain and  Feingold and by Representatives Shays and Meehan, and previously  introduced in the last Congress, would establish a new, effective  agency to enforce the nation's campaign finance laws.</p>
<p>   The bill would create a new independent agency, the Federal  Election Administration (FEA), to replace the FEC. The new  enforcement agency would include a Chairman with strong powers  and two other members appointed by the President and confirmed by  the Senate. The Chairman would serve for 10 years and have broad  powers to manage and administer the agency. The other two members  would serve for six year terms. No two members of the new FEA  could be from the same political party.</p>
<p>   The FEC consists of six Commissioners, three from each  political party. The position of FEC Chairman rotates on an  annual basis among the Commissioners and does not have the  authority to manage and administer the agency.</p>
<p>   The new agency would use impartial administrative law judges  to hear and decide campaign finance enforcement proceedings, an  approach currently used by a number of other oversight and  enforcement agencies to provide for independent, impartial  decisions, but not used by the FEC.</p>
<p>   The new agency would have real enforcement powers, including  the power to find that violations of law have occurred, to  directly impose civil penalties and to issue cease and desist  orders. These are enforcement powers available to other federal  agencies but not available to the FEC.</p>
<p>   On May 15, 2002, Democracy 21 released NO BARK, NO BITE, NO  POINT, a comprehensive 142-page report prepared by a blue ribbon  task force that detailed the failures of the FEC and made  recommendations for the creation of a new agency to enforce the  nation's campaign finance laws.</p>
<p>   The Democracy 21 task force report found that among the major  reasons for the failure of the FEC are the ineffectual structure  and cumbersome procedures of the Commission, the politicization  of the appointment of commissioners, the lack of effective  enforcement powers, the denial of adequate resources and  congressional interference with the agency.</p>
