<p>IVORY COAST - July 11 - The ICRC has completed a food and agriculture programme in 23 villages of the "confidence zone," situated southeast of Bouaké.


<p>Under the programme, which was conducted from 21 June to 5 July in cooperation with volunteers from the Red Cross Society of Côte d'Ivoire, 156 tonnes of yam seed and 15.6 tonnes of maize seed were distributed to 1,481 households (12,500 people), the purpose being to improve their food security.

<p>A preliminary assessment carried out by ICRC delegates had shown that several villages were in a precarious situation and that the population as a whole was facing pauperization, owing partly to the influx of farmers fleeing the west and north of the country because of the crisis, and partly to the difficulty of reaching this area and trading there. Another contributing factor was the lack of rainfall last year.

<p>The ICRC will provide the farmers with technical assistance until the next harvest.
