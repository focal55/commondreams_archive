<p>WASHINGTON - July 21 -
The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities will hold a conference call briefing on Tuesday, July 25 at 12:00 p.m. (ET) to discuss two bills the House is expected to consider that week that would establish “sunset commissions” to recommend the elimination or scaling back of federal programs, agencies and regulations.

<p>The bills’ sponsors have presented them as “good government” reforms that will increase efficiency and reduce waste.  Center analysts will examine this claim in light of what the two bills would actually do:

<blockquote><li> As a new Center analysis of the two bills explains, the commissions that the bills would establish would likely operate in a partisan fashion.  The commission could adopt recommendations to terminate or cut programs and eliminate regulations by a bare majority vote.  Under one bill, special procedures would then be used to facilitate Congressional approval.  Under the other, agencies would automatically be abolished if legislation to reauthorize them is not enacted within a one-year period.  Under both bills, programs, agencies, and rules and regulations could be eliminated without a single vote being cast by a member of the minority party, either on the commission or in Congress, and with members of the minority party barred even from offering amendments on the House and Senate floors.

    <p><li>While successful commissions usually are formed to operate in a bipartisan fashion, these bills would use a commission approach to enable program terminations and cuts that cannot pass Congress under normal procedures to be achieved through the use of special procedures on a strictly partisan basis.

    <p><li>The bills also have an ideological slant, since the commissions would be prohibited from proposing to eliminate or scale back any of the roughly $800 billion a year in what the GAO, CBO and OMB refer to as “tax expenditures” (i.e., spending accomplished through the tax code), no matter how inefficient or unnecessary some tax expenditures may be.
</blockquote>
<p>After initial presentations, the participants will take questions from reporters.
