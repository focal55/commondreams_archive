<p>WASHINGTON - June 29 
<p><b><a href="mailto:Naruri@aol.com">NASEER ARURI</a></b><br>
Aruri is chancellor professor emeritus of political science at the 
University of Massachusetts at Dartmouth and author of the book "Dishonest Broker: The U.S. Role in Israel and Palestine." He said 
today: "Virtually every one of the nearly one hundred Hamas officials 
and lawmakers that Israel has taken prisoner has called for the release 
of the Israeli soldier. Israel's actions are totally contrary to its 
stated goal of rescuing the boy. More generally, Hamas leadership has 
refrained from suicide bombings for more than a year, despite Israel 
assassinating some of them. A Hamas engaged in diplomacy is apparently 
more upsetting to Israel than one engaged in suicide bombings. ... 
Israel has not bet on a Hamas endorsing the two-state solution." See: "<a href="http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/732528.html" target="_new">Hamas Arrests Planned Weeks Ago</a>" from the Israeli newspaper Haaretz.

<p><a href="mailto:zunes@usfca.edu"><b>STEPHEN ZUNES</b></a><br> 
Zunes is Middle East editor for Foreign Policy In Focus and author 
of the book "Tinderbox: U.S. Middle East Policy and the Roots of 
Terrorism." He said today: "Though a carefully-targeted Israeli 
paramilitary operation to liberate the captured soldier could perhaps be 
considered legitimate, Israel's decision to respond by destroying 
bridges, power stations, and other civilian targets constitutes 
collective punishment, which is expressly forbidden by international 
law. In addition, the launching of this destructive assault just when 
the Palestinians are exploring new diplomatic initiatives appears 
designed to further delay a resumption of the peace process."

today: "We are already receiving reports of civilians being killed from 
the Israeli attack -- as well as houses being demolished."<br>

<p><b><a href="mailto:rafahtoday@yahoo.com">MOHAMMAD OMER</a></b><br>
A freelance journalist and photographer, Omer writes the Rafah Today 
blog. He said today: "Most of the Western reporters are in hotels in 
Jerusalem, not in Gaza. There are constant sonic booms from Israeli jet 
fighters frightening everyone here, particularly the children."

<p><b><a href="mailto:Awaskow@aol.com">RABBI ARTHUR WASKOW</a></b><br>
Director of the Shalom Center, Waskow asked about the attack on 
Israeli soldiers: "What kind of narrowness of thought and disregard for 
human life, not just of the soldiers being directly attacked, but the 
victims of the consequences -- was involved in the decision to carry out 
this attack? What kind of disregard and narrowness of thought was 
involved in destroying more of the infrastructure of Gaza, thus 
punishing hundreds of thousands of the common folk with more misery, 
more hunger, more thirst, more disease, more death?"

<p><b><a href="mailto:laila.elhaddad@gmail.com">LAILA EL-HADDAD</a></b><br>
A journalist based in the U.S. and the Gaza Strip, El-Haddad said 
today: "Hamas made some effort, but I don't think they were capable of 
stopping the Qassam rocket attacks into Israel -- after all, Israel 
couldn't stop the attacks when it was in Gaza. There are numerous 
splinter factions and a lot of competing interests."

<p><a href="mailto:barbara@mecaforpeace.org"><b>BARBARA LUBIN</b></a><br> 
Director of the Middle East Children's Alliance, Lubin recently 
returned from Gaza. She said today: "The children in the Gaza Strip have 
been suffering for a long time even before this latest bombing. The 
borders to Gaza have been closed for months. No food or medicine have 
been allowed into the area, and because countries like the U.S. and 
Europe have withheld financial aid, most of the workers have not 
received a paycheck since February. With the bombing of the electric 
plant the children now face new diseases. The Middle East Children's 
Alliance will continue to send much-needed food and medicine to the 
children."<br>
