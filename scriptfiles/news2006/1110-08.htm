<p>WASHINGTON - November 10 - Military Families Speak Out (MFSO), a national organization of people opposed to the war in Iraq who have relatives or loved ones in the military will honor the over 2,800 American service men and women, and tens of thousands of Iraqi children, women, and men who have died as a result of the war in Iraq this Saturday November 11, 2006 for Veterans Day.  Fifty military families from across the country, including Gold Star families whose loved ones were killed in Iraq, military families with loved ones currently serving in Iraq and those with loved ones who have served and/or are due to deploy, will display an exhibit of over 2,800 flags and photographs on the National Mall.  Earlier this week, over thirty military families from California, Colorado, Missouri, New Jersey, South Carolina and other states gathered in Washington, D.C. to deliver petitions to the Pentagon and Congress calling for an end to troop extensions, stop-loss orders, involuntary re-calls, multiple deployments, and other aspects of the “back door draft,” and for all troops to be brought home now.
