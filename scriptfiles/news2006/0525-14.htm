<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->WASHINGTON - May 25 - After a grassroots campaign initiated by the Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood (CCFC) and Dads and Daughters (DADs), Hasbro announced today that they were canceling their planned line of dolls based on the Pussycat Dolls, a real-life burlesque troupe turned music group famous for their sexualized lyrics and dance routines.  On Monday, CCFC and DADs launched a letter-writing campaign urging the toy giant to reverse its plan to market the blatantly eroticized dolls to girls as young as six.  Today, the efforts of parents around the country were rewarded when Hasbro issued the following statement: 

 

<p>“Hasbro and Interscope have jointly agreed that Hasbro will not move forward with the line of dolls based on the recording group, The Pussycat Dolls. Interscope’s current creative direction and images for the recording group are focused on a much older target than we had anticipated at the time of our original discussions, thereby making a doll line inappropriate for Hasbro.”

 

<p>"We’re thrilled that Hasbro responded to the concerns expressed by the many people who participated in our letter-writing campaign, and that they are putting the well-being of children above their bottom line,”  said Dr. Susan Linn, CCFC’s co-founder,   “Hasbro’s decision underscores the importance of working together to stop the commercial exploitation of children."

 

<p>Lisa Flythe, a CCFC member who had written to Hasbro and first alerted CCFC about the dolls, was gratified by Hasbro’s decision:  “As a parent of a four-year-old girl, I’m grateful that Hasbro has decided not to join with other toy, media and marketing companies in escalating the sexualization of little girls.  I hope that other companies will follow their example.” 

 

<p>Dads & Daughters President Joe Kelly called Hasbro’s decision a victory for families and responsible corporate practice. “We asked Hasbro executives to imagine encouraging their own six-year-old daughters and granddaughters to engage in developmentally unhealthy behavior. It appears that they did that, and then made the right decision for their families, our families, and the company.”
