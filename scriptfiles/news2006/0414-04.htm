<p>WASHINGTON - April 14 - FAIR's radio show CounterSpin takes a look this week at the
"Massachusetts miracle," the health care plan passed by the Massachusetts
legislature and touted by Gov. Mitt Romney. The legislation made front pages
last week, with many accounts calling it a plan for universal health care. Our
guest says that's just what it's not. So how are is press getting it wrong? We
talk with Steffie Woolhandler, associate professor of medicine at Harvard
University and cofounder of Physicians for a National Health Program.<br>
<br>

Also on the show: A contributor to the New York Post's Page Six gossip column reportedly
tried to shake down a subject for hundreds of thousands of dollars for
"protection" against negative coverage in the column. CounterSpin
talks to New York Observer columnist Joe Conason, who says the gossip columnist
may have been just following the example of Post owner Rupert Murdoch, who has
long used his media holdings to trade favors and punish enemies.
