<p>WASHINGTON - January 25 - President Bush is expected to speak today at the National 
Security Agency in Fort Meade, Maryland, to defend his continuing approval of 
that agency&#8217;s warrantless wiretap program. The American Civil Liberties Union 
has denounced that operation because it continues to violate both the letter and 
spirit of the law, and renewed its call for comprehensive and open Congressional 
hearings and for Attorney General Gonzales to appoint a special counsel to begin 
an independent investigation of the program.</P>
<P>The ACLU has also filed a lawsuit against the NSA on behalf of a group of 
prominent journalists, nonprofits, terrorism experts and community advocates. 
The suit argues that the president's program violates the First and Fourth 
Amendment and the separation of powers.</P>
<P>The following can be attributed to Anthony D. Romero, ACLU Executive 
Director:</P>
<P>"President Bush and his surrogates can justify this program all they want, 
but they cannot change the underlying fact that it remains an illegal program. 
Our nation was founded upon on the principles of checks and balances and a 
respect for the rule of law. The continued approval for this unlawful program 
undermines the very freedoms and values that define America.</P>
<P>"Numerous legal scholars, from the left and right, and the non-partisan 
Congressional Research Service all agree that the president overstepped his 
authority when he approved the program and that he failed to properly brief 
Congress, as required by law. From the Palmer Raids to COINTELPRO, many others 
have claimed &#8216;national security&#8217; as a reason to expand the power of the 
executive; their intentions did not change the fact that they were violating the 
law.</P>
<P>"We applaud Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Arlen Specter for agreeing to 
hold hearings and we call on all relevant committees to do the same. A thorough 
examination will show that this domestic spying program violates our laws and 
our freedoms. America agrees: a new CNN/Gallup/USA Today survey shows that a 
majority of Americans said the president was wrong in using these warrantless 
wiretaps. The rule of law must be restored."</P>
