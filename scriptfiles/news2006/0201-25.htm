<p>WASHINGTON - February 1 - 20/20 Vision applauds the President’s renewed commitment to reducing America’s dependence on Middle East oil, as noted in last night’s State of the Union address.  We especially note his support for advanced hybrid cars and better ethanol fuels that can replace gasoline.  Key to the success of these efforts will be educating Americans—particularly young Americans—on the need to switch to new types of cars and fuels.  “This critical public education effort cannot start soon enough,” explained 20/20 Vision Executive Director, Tom Collina. “Young people need to understand that the cars and fuels they buy today will directly impact their security, economy and environment tomorrow.” 
 
<p>The burden of America’s oil addiction is causing immediate hardships for all Americans but will be especially vital to the interests of those in future generations. With the rise in gas prices after hurricanes Katrina and Rita and continued instability among the world’s largest oil-producing nations, we believe that America is ready to look at long-term solutions to our dependence on oil. 
 
<p>In response, 20/20 Vision and a coalition of national organizations will organize a series of regional conferences on university campuses throughout the country to bring understanding about the dangers of US oil dependency to our economy, security and environment, while exploring promising solutions.  A key component of the conferences will be the Oil Shockwave simulation developed by our co-sponsors, the National Commission on Energy Policy and Securing America’s Future Energy.     
 
<p>A primary goal of the conferences is to look at oil dependency as a national security, economic and environmental issue.  By doing so, we can bridge the gap between federal and state decision-makers, industry, farmers, environmentalists, students and the public.  “This forum will begin to explore some promising solutions and national policies that can reduce oil consumption,” said Collina.  “Now is the time to pull these issues together and show Americans how their energy choices can effect the economy, their health and national security.”    
 
<p>The tour will begin on April 1, 2006 in Kalamazoo, MI and will continue with subsequent stops in Portland, OR, Richmond, VA, Orlando, FL, Lawrence, KS, Fort Wayne, IN and Washington, D.C. All events are sponsored by 20/20 Vision’s Education Fund, The National Commission on Energy Policy, Securing America’s Future Energy, The Foundation for the Defense of Democracies, Americans for an Informed Democracy, Union of Concerned Scientists, The Natural Resources Defense Council, and more.
