<p>WASHINGTON - January 6 - Participatory democracy  has reached new heights.  Americans are invited to vote for the  public policy ideas that they believe have the best chance of  strengthening our economy and improving the lives of working  people.  The top ideas will get support from the nation's fastest  growing union, which will promote them with lawmakers and the  public.  And it's all happening online.</p>
<p>   On <a href="http://www.SinceSlicedBread.com">SinceSlicedBread.com</a>, people can review 21 policy ideas  chosen by a diverse panel of judges from more than  22,000 submitted by everyday working people.  Beginning Monday at  9 a.m., visitors to the site can vote for the three they think are  the best ideas &quot;since sliced bread.&quot;  </p>
<p>   Sponsored by the Service Employees International Union (SEIU),  SinceSlicedBread.com received ideas from people in every single  state.  They addressed improving public schools, simplifying to  tax code, making health care more accessible and affordable, and  more.  The winning ideas will be announced on Feb. 1 and will  receive SEIU's support.  The creator of the winning idea also  will receive $100,000, and the creators of the two runners up  will receive $50,000 each.</p>

<p>   &quot;We asked Americans for their ideas on how to make this  country a better place to live and work,&quot; said SEIU President  Andy Stern.  &quot;The response was overwhelming.  We received more  than 22,000 suggestions from people in every state and  congressional district.  Now we're asking Americans to choose the  ideas that would most improve their lives from the 21 finalists.&quot;</p>
<p>   A panel of leading economists, thinkers, businesspeople, labor  leaders, activists and Wall Street investors selected the top  21 ideas to be voted on.  The panel includes such notable names as  Bill Bradley, Ed Rollins and President and Founder of Teach for  America, Wendy Kopp.  </p>
