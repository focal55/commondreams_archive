<p>WASHINGTON - February 1 - Consumers Union's  Internet animation parodying the prescription drug industry --  and its accompany online advocacy campaign to reform drug safety  and affordability -- was lauded by the Public Affairs Council for  the best Technology Innovation in grassroots outreach.</p>
<p>   The animation, &quot;The Drugs I Need,&quot; was launched in March by  Consumers Union to highlight the massive amount of drug industry  advertising and marketing to consumers. Featured on the Jib Jab  Web site, as well as on The Today Show and The New York Times,  the animation has been viewed by more than 2.5 million people and  generated more than 30,000 letters to Congress supporting drug  safety and pricing reform.</p>
<p>   &quot;The drug industry spends millions of dollars lobbying  politicians to build their profits, but consumers don't have that  kind of access to get their voices heard about skyrocketing drug  costs or unsafe medicines,&quot; said Rob Schneider, director of  Consumers Union's <a href="http://releases.usnewswire.com/redir.asp?ReleaseID=60312&Link=http://www.PrescriptionforChange.org">http://www.PrescriptionforChange.org</a> campaign,  where the animation can be viewed.</p>
<p>   &quot;By using the Internet, we created a quick and easy way for  consumers to join together to have their frustrations with the  drug industry heard in Congress,&quot; Schneider said.</p>
<p>   The song, created by the Texas bluegrass band the Austin  Lounge Lizards, is a humorous take on drug companies' billion- dollar marketing budgets, the serious side effects associated  with blockbuster drugs, and the high costs Americans pay. Among  the lyrics:</p>
<p>   &quot;You've got a headache, I've got some strange disease    Don't worry about it, this pill will set your mind at ease    It's called Progenitorivox, It's made by SquabbMerlCo    It's a life-enhancing miracle, but there are some things you  should know...    It may cause agitation, palpitations, excessive salivation,    Constipation, male lactation, rust-colored urination    Hallucinations, bad vibrations, mild electric shock sensations    But it's worth it for the drugs I need.&quot;</p>
<p>   The humorous animation was created by the Animation Farm.  After someone plays the animation they are directed to more  information about drug safety and have an opportunity to send an  email to Congress, using Consumers Union's e-outreach tool.</p>
<p>   First presented in 2000, the Public Affairs Council awards  recognize the nation's best grassroots programs and campaigns.  Launched in 1954 at the urging of President Eisenhower, the non- partisan, non-political organization is the leading association  for public affairs professionals. The awards were presented at  the Council's 29th annual conference in Key West, Fla., Jan. 24- 27.</p>
