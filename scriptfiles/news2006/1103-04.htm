<p>NEW YORK - November 3 - Nation editor and publisher Katrina vanden Heuvel today announced the launch of <a href="http://www.thenation.com/events/">Around The Nation</a>, a calendar of events of interest to progressives on <a href="http://www.thenation.com/">TheNation.com</a>.  Around The Nation gives grassroots organizations and readers access to an online tool that allows them to list political, social and cultural happenings across the country.


<p>"For some time now, The Nation has sought to bring together the many communities that read the magazine and come to our website and events.  With the Around The Nation feature, we hope to provide a one-stop space for people with shared interests," said vanden Heuvel.  "I think it's going to be politically and culturally engaging and a great resource for those who believe that action engenders hope!"


<p>The Around The Nation calendar will feature a daily list of events happening in all 50 states.  All users will have the ability to post their organization's events online and to provide a brief description of it as well as share a link to their site.  The events will include such things as demonstrations, rallies, Congressional hearings, award ceremonies, concerts, conventions, author signings/speaking engagements, and more - anything the general public should know about and might want to attend.  


<p>The Nation is especially interested in programs in the South, West and Middle America.  The Around The Nation progressive calendar can be accessed at <a href="www.thenation.com/events">www.thenation.com/events</a> and is launching in beta today.


<p>The Nation is America's most widely read opinion magazine and oldest weekly.  Founded in 1865,   has long been regarded as one of the country's leading progressive journalistic voices.  Covering politics and culture, the magazine, website and its other operations have remained true to its original commitment -- to be an engaged, passionate and independent voice in American journalism.
