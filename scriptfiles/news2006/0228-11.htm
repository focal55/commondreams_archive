<P>WASHINGTON - February 28 - Today, Citizens for  Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) forwarded a  complaint to the House Committee on Standards of Official  Conduct, better known as the Ethics Committee, against Rep. Sam  Johnson (R-Texas) for using executive branch resources, namely  the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), for partisan political  purposes. The complaint alleges that Rep. Johnson asked the IRS  to audit Texans for Public Justice (TPJ) as punishment for the  organization's role in sparking the Texas criminal investigation  of Rep. Tom DeLay (R-Texas).</p>
<p>   Although outside groups are barred from filing complaints,  CREW decided to forward this complaint to the Committee because  under the long-standing ethics &quot;truce&quot; in the House, Members have  been directed by their leaders not to file ethics complaints  against other Members.</p>
<p>   CREW released its complaint in the hope that a Member of the  House will certify that the complaint has a good faith basis and  forward it to the Ethics Committee, stating that the complaint  merits the Committee's consideration. </p>
<p>   CREW based its complaint on a Feb. 27, 2006 story by R.  Jeffrey Smith in The Washington Post as well as documents  released by TPJ. On Aug. 3, 2004, Rep. Johnson sent a letter to  IRS Commissioner Mark W. Everson, claiming that he had &quot;uncovered  some disturbing information&quot; about Texans for Public Justice  (TPJ).</p>
<p>   Rep. Johnson requested an investigation into TPJ and an  affiliated foundation after Barnaby W. Zall, a Washington lawyer  with ties to Rep. DeLay sent Rep. Johnson a letter complaining  about TPJ and noting that Rep. Johnson's subcommittee had  &quot;jurisdiction to review the Internal Revenue Service's  supervision of tax-exempt organizations.&quot;  Zall alleged that  Travis County District Attorney Ronnie Earle was part of an  effort, along with TPJ, by Texas Democrats to force Rep. DeLay to  step down as Majority Leader.  Zall argued that the IRS should  investigate TPJ for &quot;engaging in an apparent attempt to influence  national politics.&quot;</p>
<p>   After receiving Rep. Johnson's complaint, the IRS conducted an  audit of TPJ determining, after an extensive review of TPJ's  records, that the groups continued to qualify for tax-exempt  status.</p>
<p>   CREW's complaint  alleges that Rep. Johnson's actions violated  31 U.S.C. Section 1301(a), which provides that official funds are  to be used only for purposes for which they are appropriated; the  Code of Ethics in Government Service, which requires all  government employees to uphold the laws of the United States and  which prohibits government employees from providing special  favors to anyone; and House Rule 23, which requires Members to  conduct themselves in a manner that reflects creditably on the  House.</p>
<p>   Coincidentally, in October 2004, the House ethics committee  admonished Rep. DeLay for using executive branch resources for  partisan purposes when he had staff contact the FAA to locate an  airplane carrying Texas state legislators.</p>
<p>   Melanie Sloan, CREW's executive director, stated, &quot;Rep.  Johnson abused the public trust by using the power of his office  to harass an organization which had taken a position with which  he disagreed.  Such actions are specifically prohibited by  federal law and ethics rules and the House ethics committee  should immediately commence an investigation into Rep. Johnson's  disgraceful conduct.&quot;  Sloan continued, &quot;After seeing the NAACP,  a Pasadena church and now Texans for Public Justice investigated,  no one can doubt that the IRS has been politicized to a degree  not seen since the dark days of the Nixon administration.&quot;</p>
<p>   A copy of CREW's complaint is available on its Web site,  <a href="http://releases.usnewswire.com/redir.asp?ReleaseID=61593&Link=http://www.citizensforethics.org">http://www.citizensforethics.org</a>.</p>
