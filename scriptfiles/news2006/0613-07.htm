<p>OXFORD, England  - June 13 - 
<UL>
  <LI><FONT face=Arial size=2>Major new study deeply critical of UK and US 
  policies in the 'war on terror', finding that they make the risk of future 
  terrorist attacks on the scale of New York, Madrid or London more likely, not 
  less likely.</FONT> 
  <LI><FONT face=Arial size=2>One of Britain's leading independent think tanks 
  concludes that the current focus on international terrorism is distracting 
  politicians from more fundamental threats to global security, causing their 
  responses to those threats to be wholly inadequate.</FONT> 
  <LI><FONT face=Arial size=2>Report receives worldwide attention and gains 
  support from major international figures in the political, military and NGO 
  world.</FONT></LI></UL>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>The 'war on terror' is a dangerous diversion and 
prevents the international community from responding effectively to the most 
likely causes of future conflict, according to a new report, <STRONG>Global 
Responses to Global Threats: Sustainable Security for the 21st Century</STRONG>, 
published 12&nbsp;June 2006. </FONT></DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>The result of an 18-month long study by Oxford 
Research Group, one of Britain's leading independent think tanks, the authors 
argue that the genuine threats to peace and the likely causes of future conflict 
are: </FONT></DIV>
<UL>
  <LI><FONT face=Arial size=2><STRONG>climate change, </STRONG></FONT>
  <LI><FONT face=Arial size=2><STRONG>competition over resources, 
  </STRONG></FONT>
  <LI><FONT face=Arial size=2><STRONG>socio-economic marginalisation,</STRONG> 
  and </FONT>
  <LI><FONT face=Arial size=2><STRONG>global 
militarisation.</STRONG></FONT></LI></UL>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>These are the trends that are likely to lead to 
substantial global and regional instability and large-scale loss of life of a 
magnitude unmatched by other potential threats, including terrorism. 
</FONT></DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>They are far more important than the current focus 
on the 'war on terror'. This deeply flawed strategy is consuming hundreds of 
billions of dollars, creating more recruits and supporters of terrorism than it 
defeats, and is diverting attention from threats to security that are far more 
serious, lasting and destructive than that of international 
terrorism.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Furthermore, the current response to insecurity is 
essentially about "control" - attempting to maintain the status quo through 
military force, without addressing the root causes. The authors argue that such 
security policies are self-defeating in the long-term, and so a new approach is 
urgently needed.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>An alternative "sustainable security" approach aims 
to address the root causes of those threats, cooperatively using the most 
effective means available. For example:</FONT></DIV>
<UL>
  <LI><FONT face=Arial size=2>renewable energy and conservation as the most 
  important response to climate change; </FONT>
  <LI><FONT face=Arial size=2>energy efficiency as a response to resource 
  competition; </FONT>
  <LI><FONT face=Arial size=2>intensive poverty reduction programmes as a means 
  to address marginalisation; and </FONT>
  <LI><FONT face=Arial size=2>the halting and reversal of WMD development and 
  proliferation as a main component of checking global militarisation. 
  </FONT></LI></UL>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>These provide the best chance of averting global 
disaster, as well as addressing some of the root causes of terrorism. 
</FONT></DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>According to Oxford Research Group, it will be 
essential to encourage governments, especially in the United States and the 
United Kingdom, to rethink their current security outlook, with the next five 
years being the key period for change if we are to avoid a highly unstable 
global system by the middle years of the century. </FONT></DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Even though both governments look very set in their 
ways and repeatedly claim "there is no alternative", there is abundant evidence 
that the 'war on terror' is proving deeply counterproductive - making the risk 
of future terrorist attacks on the scale of New York, Madrid or London more 
likely, not less likely. </FONT></DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>The Iraq war is now into its fourth year and the 
conflict in Afghanistan moves into its sixth year in October, yet both countries 
are increasingly unstable and violent while the al-Qaida movement is as active 
as ever. In such circumstances, the authors of the report believe there is now 
real opportunity for an intensive debate leading to a realistic chance of 
changes in policy.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Commenting on the publication of the report, former 
UK Secretary of State for International Development, <STRONG>Clare Short 
MP</STRONG>, said: </FONT></DIV>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
  <DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>"Current US and UK foreign policy is totally 
  counterproductive and is encouraging terrorism and proliferation of WMD. This 
  report offers a serious alternative which would make the world safer. I hope 
  it is widely read." </FONT></DIV></BLOCKQUOTE>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>The Liberal Democrat spokesperson on defence in the 
House of Lords, <STRONG>Air Marshal the Lord Garden</STRONG>, added: 
</FONT></DIV>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
  <DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>"This report takes a measured look at the 
  challenges that the planet faces in the coming years, and offers a coherent 
  strategy to make the world a safer place. If we are to reverse the deepening 
  crisis, a global approach to security in all it aspects is needed. The authors 
  offer a compelling starting point." </FONT></DIV></BLOCKQUOTE>

report</FONT></STRONG></DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>"This new report argues very persuasively and cogently that the war against 
terrorism has been a near-term distraction from a set of more fundamental, 
long-term issues that seriously threaten the future well-being of the globe. If 
this report can encourage even a few policy-makers to shift their focus from 
tactics that win elections to solutions that benefit society, it will have 
served a very useful purpose indeed."<BR><STRONG>Professor Jack Mendelsohn, US 
Department of State (1963-85); Professor of National Security Affairs, US Naval 
Academy (1998-99)</STRONG></DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>"An important, profound, up-to-date report that provides the background to 
elaborate a serious multilateral and global peace and security policy. A must 
for decision-makers."<BR><STRONG>Dr. Mariano Aguirre, Co-director, Fundación 
para las Relaciones Internacionales y el Diálogo Exterior (FRIDE), 
Spain</STRONG></DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>"The post 9/11 mainstream security discourse has run on three myths: that 
terrorism has no causes worth discussing, that terrorism is only 
non-governmental, and that the 'war on terror' should be given priority over all 
other global challenges. With a wealth of facts and solid arguments, this report 
debunks these myths and tells how urgent it is that governments and civil 
society re-think and widen security concepts as well as 
policies."<BR><STRONG>Dr. Jan Oberg, Director, Transnational Foundation for 
Peace and Future Research (TFF), Sweden</STRONG></DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>"A serious, profound, thought-provoking report. This valuable study will 
greatly benefit the common efforts to build a better world."<BR><STRONG>Niu 
Qiang, Secretary General, Chinese People's Association for Peace and Disarmament 
</STRONG></DIV>
<DIV><STRONG></STRONG>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>"Essential reading and reference for anyone concerned with turning the 
world away from its current disastrous path. Not only does this report show 
clearly the full picture of the interrelated problems we face, it offers a 
bracing prescription for how we can change course towards a more secure 
future."<BR><STRONG>Janet Bloomfield, British Coordinator, Atomic Mirror; Chair, 
Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (1993-96)</STRONG></DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>"A truly inspirational report. It blows an overdue gust of wise analysis 
and well-reasoned argument through the counterproductive and self-serving 
US-driven response to the current world disorder. The younger generation in 
particular desperately need its imaginative and hopeful ideas for sustainable 
alternative security strategies."<BR><STRONG>Commander Robert Green, Disarmament 
and Security Centre, New Zealand Peace Foundation</STRONG></DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>"In this report the authors have examined threats to peace and security 
from a perspective which seeks to remove these threats and create a world of 
sustainable security for all. The core issues discussed, and their 
interconnectedness are extremely important to consider and to consider now, 
while there is still time and opportunity to address them. The recommendations 
provided in this report must be taken seriously."<BR><STRONG>Susi Snyder,
