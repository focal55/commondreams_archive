<p>NEW YORK - June 26 - The following Green Party
          candidates will march on Sunday: Alison Duncan, candidate for
          Lieutenant Governor, Julia Willebrand, candidate for Comptroller,
          Malachy McCourt, candidate for Governor, Howie Hawkins, candidate for
          US Senate, Peter Camejo, candidate for Governor of California, and
          Aaron Dixon, candidate for US Senate from Washington.</p>
          <p class="navigate">&quot;We are marching Sunday for love and
          life,&quot; said Alison Duncan, Green Party candidate for Lieutenant
          Governor of New York. &quot;We are marching not only for LGBT civil
          rights, but also to address the need of our children to be safe in
          their schools and families, the needs of our elderly for safe and
          respectful access to care and services, and the needs of our community
          for universal healthcare and medical research.&quot;</p>
          <p class="navigate">&quot;As the proud parent of a lesbian, I will
          work to ensure that my daughter has the same rights and privileges as
          everybody else,&quot; said Julia Willebrand, Green Party candidate for
          Comptroller of New York. &quot;I will use the comptroller's power as
          sole trustee of $120 billion dollars in retirement funds to pressure
          publicly-traded corporations to initiate LGBT-friendly workplace
          policies,&quot; added Willebrand.</p>
          <p class="navigate">&quot;It's time to legalize same-sex
          marriage,&quot; said Howie Hawkins, Green Party candidate for US
          Senate from New York. &quot;1,138 rights and responsibilities from the
          federal government and another 700 rights and responsibilities from
          New York government are bestowed on partners in civil marriage.
          Marriage equality is a matter of human rights and equality under the
          law.&quot;</p>
