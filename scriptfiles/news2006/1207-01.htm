<p>WASHINGTON - December 7 - Amnesty International  USA (AIUSA) has urged Florida Gov. Jeb Bush to halt the execution  of Angel Diaz, which is scheduled to take place on Wednesday,  Dec. 13. If it proceeds, the execution would be the last to take  place this year and the fourth in Florida in the last two months. </p>
<p>   Amnesty International, the world's largest grassroots human  rights organization, has issued a worldwide call to action  regarding Diaz's case, mobilizing the public to send appeals to  Gov. Bush on Diaz's behalf. AIUSA Executive Director Larry Cox  has also written Gov. Bush, urging commutation of Diaz's  sentence. </p>
<p>   &quot;On behalf of more than 320,000 members of Amnesty  International USA, I appeal to you to do everything in your power  to stop the execution of Puerto Rican national Angel Nieves  Diaz,&quot; Cox wrote to Bush. &quot;As an international human rights  organization, Amnesty International opposes the death penalty in  all cases without reservation. While I have tremendous sympathy  for the family and friends of Joseph Nagy, I believe capital  punishment only perpetuates the cycle of violence.&quot; </p>
<p>   Anibal Acevedo Vila, governor of Puerto Rico, has also taken  the unusual step of writing to Gov. Bush requesting clemency for  Diaz, citing Puerto Rico's longstanding opposition to the death  penalty. </p>
<p>   Angel Diaz was sentenced to death for the 1979 robbery and  murder of bar manager Joseph Nagy. He was allowed to represent  himself at trial even though he had limited command of the  English language, had no knowledge of how trials were conducted,  and had not finished high school. Assessments conducted by mental  health experts also suggest that Angel Diaz suffers from various  mental disorders.</p>
<p>   Although two other men were involved in the robbery of the  bar, co-defendant Angel Toro pled guilty to second-degree murder  and was sentenced to life in prison. The testimony of Ralph  Gajus, a jailhouse informant, was central to the prosecution's  allegations that Diaz was the gunman. Gajus has now provided a  sworn affidavit stating that his testimony was false and that he  knew nothing about the crime.</p>
<p>   At the sentencing, it was argued in mitigation against a death  sentence that Diaz had only been an accomplice to the crime, but  no new evidence of this was presented. Research has repeatedly  demonstrated that residual doubt about guilt is a highly  mitigating factor in the minds of capital jurors. Although the  jury recommended a death sentence for Diaz, it did so only by  eight votes to four, indicating possible residual doubt in the  minds of the jurors, even with the testimony of Gajus. Without  Gajus' testimony, it is possible that more of the jurors would  have voted against a death sentence. </p>
<p>   Testimony given by people who are themselves in custody or  facing criminal prosecution has been shown to be frequently  unreliable. Research at Northwestern University in Illinois has  revealed that the use of such informants was among the three most  prevalent factors in wrongful capital convictions in the United  States. A review of 111 such cases from 1973 to 2004 found the  use of false testimony in 46 percent of the cases. </p>
<p>   &quot;Testimony by jailhouse informants is notoriously unreliable  and is a leading cause of wrongful convictions in this country,&quot;  said Sue Gunawardena-Vaughn, the director of AIUSA's Program to  Abolish the Death Penalty. &quot;It would be a travesty of justice for  the state of Florida to allow this execution to proceed now that  a key piece of the prosecution's case has been called into  question.&quot;</p>
<p>   This case exemplifies many of the concerns raised earlier this  fall by the American Bar Association, which conducted a thorough  study of Florida's capital punishment policies. Florida is the  only state in the country that does not require a jury to be  unanimous in recommending the death penalty. Four of the jurors  in Diaz's trial did not vote for the death penalty; it is highly  likely that without the damaging testimony of Gajus, even more  would have voted against a death sentence.</p>
<p>   &quot;Gov. Bush's last days in office should not involve the  execution of a man who was incompetent to stand trial and who was  sentenced largely on the basis of testimony that has since been  recanted by a jailhouse snitch,&quot; said Mark Elliott, AIUSA's State  Death Penalty Abolition Coordinator for Florida. &quot;We call upon  the governor to make a final stand for justice and to stop this  execution from proceeding.&quot;</p>
