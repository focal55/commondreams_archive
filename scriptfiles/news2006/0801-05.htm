<p>WASHINGTON - August 1 - A letter signed by 546 scientists was sent to Senators today warning about the negative impacts of logging after fires and other natural disturbances.  The letter, released a day before a hearing in the Senate Agriculture Committee’s Forestry Subcommittee on the Walden logging bill, passed by the House of Representatives.  The bill, H.R. 4200, would fast-track logging by suspending environmental safeguards and reducing the American public's ability to give input on how their forests are managed.

 

<p>“We are concerned that H.R. 4200 will bind us to land management practices that, perhaps logical in the past, are no longer tenable in the light of recent scientific understanding,” says the scientists’ letter.  “Neither ecological benefits nor economic efficiency result from post disturbance logging.”

 

<p>A copy of the scientists’ letter is available <a href="http://americanlands.org/documents/1154442267_Scientists%20letter%20HR4200-S2709%20_546_%208.1.06.pdf%20" target="_new">here</a>.
<p>“Post disturbance logging prevents or slows natural recovery by slowing the establishment of plant and animal populations and degrading streams, damages terrestrial and aquatic systems, plant and animal communities, sensitive areas, and crucial regional resources such as soils,” said Dr. James Karr, an aquatic and avian ecologist at University of Washington and author of several studies on post-fire logging.  “Rather than rush to implement emergency treatments, rather than set aside a half century of ecological research and risk undermining the public’s interest in healthy federal lands—as H.R. 4200 appears to do—I respectfully urge this committee to examine with great care the act’s potentially irreversible consequences.” 
<p>The August issue of the journal <I style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal"><A

<p>“No substantive evidence supports the idea that fire-adapted forests might be improved by logging after a fire.  In fact, many carefully conducted studies have concluded just the opposite,” said Dr. Reed Noss, professor of Conservation Biology for the University of Central Florida.  “Most plants and animals in these forests are adapted to periodic fires and other natural disturbances. They have a remarkable way of recovering ¾ literally rising from the ashes ¾ because they have evolved with and even depend upon fire,” 

 

<p>One of the papers in <i>Conservation Biology</i> by Dr. Richard Hutto, Professor and Director of Avian Science Center at the University of Montana, raises significant doubts that the current standards to mitigate the impacts of post fire logging protect wildlife species that depend on burned forests.  

 

<p>"Existing post-fire salvage logging studies reveal that most post-fire specialist species [like the Black-backed Woodpecker] are completely absent from burned forests that have been (even partially) salvage logged," writes Dr. Hutto.  He also notes that the development of more meaningful snag (standing dead trees) retention guidelines for post-fire specialists would preclude logging in burned conifer forests where the maintenance of biological diversity is deemed important.”

 

<p>Witnesses at the August 2 Senate hearing opposing H.R. 4200 include Oregon State Senator Charlie Ringo and Dr. James Karr.  Senator Ringo obtained and released emails revealing that professors at Oregon State University that supported H.R. 4200 sought to discredit research in the journal <i>Science</i> showing that post-fire logging harms forest recovery and increases fire risks.

 

<p>A study by an Oregon State University graduate student Daniel Donato and others was the target of efforts by OSU Forestry Dean Hal Salwasser and Professor John Sessions to prevent its publication and then to discredit its claims.  The Donato study was published in the prestigious journal <i>Science</i> and the negative publicity generated by this attack on academic freedom led to widespread exposure of Donato’s findings.  

 

<p>AP reports that opponents of the study will soon publish a rebuttal in this month’s issue of <i>Science</i>.  Donato is standing by the groups’ findings, saying, “The conclusions were supported by independent statistical evaluations, and the rebuttals provide no compelling evidence to refute our findings.”

 

<p>The Donato study is the not the first scientific research that shows logging after fires causes environmental harm or increases fire risks.  There is abundant scientific evidence that salvage logging can have diverse and significant negative impacts on ecological recovery including over 30 scientific publications and government reports such as the Interior Columbia Basin Ecosystem Management Project and the recommendations of scientists representing the Forest Ecosystem Management Team that assembled the Northwest Forest Plan.  

 

<p>“Proponents of expedited post-fire logging can’t provide a significant body of evidence that a nationwide program of logging after disturbance is scientifically justified,” said Dominick DellaSala, Ph.D., of the National Center for Conservation Science & Policy.   “Of the more than 30 scientific papers on post-fire logging published to date, not a single one indicates that logging provides benefits to ecosystems regenerating after disturbance.”
