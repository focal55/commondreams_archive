<p>WASHINGTON - January 13 - Lobbying firms representing some of the largest contracting interests and defense contractors sponsored the holiday party in December for the House Government Reform Committee, which has jurisdiction over federal contracting issues. Sponsors of the event Included Patton Boggs, PodestaMattoon, General Dynamics, BearingPoint, and Innovative Defense Strategies.

<p>Former staff members for the Committee's Chairman, Tom Davis (R-VA), worked for several of the lobbying firms representing major contractors including MCI, which is bidding on a $20 billion telecommunications contract that is a pet project of Chairman Davis. A few  sponsors were involved in drafting or supporting Davis-sponsored legislation which guts protections that prevent contractors from overcharging the government. Some provisions of that legislation have passed on defense authorization bills.

<p>The event took place in the Rayburn House Office Building. Unconfirmed is whether the same sponsors have hosted the event in years past. To learn more about the sponsors and to see a copy of the event invitation, go to POGO's blog at: http://pogoblog.typepad.com/
