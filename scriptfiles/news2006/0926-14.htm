<p>NEW YORK - September 26 - The role of the consulting and engineering firm Booz Allen Hamilton, 
Inc. in providing oversight for the SWIFT surveillance program, much touted by 
the program&#8217;s defenders, was called into significant question today by the 
American Civil Liberties Union and Privacy International, which released a memo 
that they prepared at the request of European regulators, documenting the 
consulting firm&#8217;s close ties to the U.S. Government. </P><P>The New York Times reported today that the regulators were planning to issue 
a report this week concluding that Booz Allen did not constitute independent 
supervision of the SWIFT monitoring program, and that the program is of dubious 
legality under European law.&nbsp; </P><P>&#8220;It is bad enough that the administration is trying to hold out a private 
company as a substitute for genuine checks and balances on its surveillance 
activities,&#8221; said Barry Steinhardt, Director of the ACLU&#8217;s Technology and 
Liberty Project.&nbsp; &#8220;But of all companies to perform audits on a secret 
surveillance program, it would be difficult to find one less objective and more 
intertwined with the U.S. government security establishment.&#8221;</P><P>After it was revealed in June that the Bush Administration was sifting 
through the records of financial transactions carried out by a financial 
cooperative, the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, or 
SWIFT, an uproar ensued over the lack of legal basis or oversight.&nbsp; In 
response, the government claimed that the searches were audited by Booz Allen 
(though the details of that process were never made clear).&nbsp; </P><P>Among the research findings contained in the memo is that Booz Allen is not 
only one of the largest government contractors, with hundreds of millions of 
dollars in contracts awarded each year, and therefore heavily dependent on the 
very agencies it is supposedly overseeing, but also that:</P><UL><LI>its staff includes many former members of the military and 
intelligence community, including a former director of the CIA and a former 
director of the NSA.<LI>it has a history of working closely with security 
agencies on electronic surveillance, including the now-defunct Total Information 
Awareness program run by Admiral John Poindexter.<LI>it has been at the 
forefront of a push to increase information collection from the private sector 
by the government.&nbsp; Several Booz Allen vice presidents, for example, have 
publicly called for sweeping efforts in that direction, even if it means 
sacrifice by and regulation of private industry.</LI></UL><P>&#8220;We knew that Booz Allen was a large contractor, but even so the results of 
this research are quite startling,&#8221; said Steinhardt.</P><P>The ACLU/PI research memo was prepared at the request of the European Article 
29 Working Group, an advisory body to the European Commission made up of 
national data protection authorities from throughout the European Union.&nbsp; 
The ACLU and Privacy International have both testified before the Article 29 
Working Group.&nbsp; In June, Privacy International sent a letter to European 
privacy commissioners calling upon them to launch investigations of the SWIFT 
data sharing. </P><P>Steinhardt said that the ACLU and PI were sharing the results of its research 
with data protection officials around the world, many of whom were conducting 
their own investigations into the SWIFT scandal. &#8220;We and Privacy International 
are working to make sure that extensive ties between Booz Allen and the 
government they are supposed to be monitoring are well known to the authorities 
charged with enforcing their nations&#8217; privacy laws,&#8221; he said.&nbsp; </P><P>&#8220;Even the weak reed of oversight that the Bush Administration has been 
leaning upon &#8211; Booz Allen &#8211; is highly suspect,&#8221; said Steinhardt.&nbsp; &#8220;If 
nothing else, Booz Allen is a prime example of a government-industry &#8216;revolving 
door&#8217; of shared personnel.&#8221;<P>The research memo is available at: <A class=noline_blue href="http://www.aclu.org/pdfs/safefree/boozallen20060914.pdf">www.aclu.org/pdfs/safefree/boozallen20060914.pdf</A>
