<p>WASHINGTON - January 10 - The Green Party today urged state legislatures in the 
northeast to significantly strengthen the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative 
(RGGI) recently announced by the governors of seven states.

<p>"The proposed compact falls far short of the actions needed to reduce the 
devastating and accelerating impact of climate change," stated Greg Gerritt, 
secretary of the Green Party of Rhode Island.  "The seven governors deserve 
praise for taking action in face of the stonewalling by both the Bush and 
Clinton administrations, but the public should push them to do much more."

<p>"We now urge the many environmental groups that campaigned for RGGI to take 
the next step and demand a more far-reaching and effective compact that 
places public health, the environment, and our future ahead of industry 
demands.  We also call on Massachusetts and Rhode Island to sign on," Mr. 
Gerritt added.

<p>The compact took several years to negotiate and was announced six months 
after the initial target date.  The Governors of Massachusetts and Rhode 
Island backed out at the last minute after objections from business lobbies, 
to the frustration of Greens and environmental and public health activists 
in those states.

<p>Greens in northeast states have called for the caps on carbon emissions by 
power plants to be significantly tightened; for all of the carbon emission 
permits (rather than the agreed upon 25%) to be auctioned off rather than 
given away to corporations; and for elimination of loopholes that weaken the 
reduction on greenhouse emissions (e.g., omitting emissions from increasing 
electricity imports from polluting coal plants in the Midwest).

<p>An overwhelming majority of scientists warn that the original Kyoto goal of 
a 5% reduction to 1991 greenhouse gas levels by 2012 is severely inadequate 
and urge a 70% reduction.  The Green Party supports this goal, and note that 
RGGI only calls for stabilizing current carbon emissions by 2015 and then 
reducing those levels by 10% by 2020.  Greens are skeptical that RGGI, which 
only addresses power plants, will accomplish even this modest goal.

<p>Greens also urged states to take more aggressive and comprehensive action to 
reduce energy use, such as imposing a carbon tax on fossil fuel use and 
increased investment in conservation.  Greens also seek to limit the rate of 
sprawl and reduce the use of automobiles.

<p>"Conservation will not only curb ongoing climate change, it will also reduce 
the costs of importing fossil fuels; create good jobs, and stimulate 
development of new energy-saving technologies, including wind and solar, 
that can generate tax revenues and new enterprises," said Rebecca Rotzler, 
Deputy Mayor of New Paltz, New York, where she is involved in a local wind 
and solar energy project.

<p>"There are many reasons why the Republicans and Democrats have shied away 
from such measures.  First, they seriously underestimate the financial, 
ecological, and social harm that will be caused by global warming.  Many of 
them contend that it'll be cheaper to suffer 'maybe a 4%' annual decrease in 
the Gross Domestic Product than to invest in changes to reduce climate 
change.  Second, some believe that a limited investment in renewable energy 
technology will alone be enough to solve the problem, and ignore the need 
for lower energy consumption.  Third, they're receiving campaign 
contributions from the energy and automobile industries that want the 
environmental impact costs from their operations to be paid by taxpayers 
rather than by the industries themselves," said Ms. Rotzler, who also serves 
as co-chair of the Green Party of the United States.

<p>Greens emphasized that there is no longer any serious debate among 
scientists about the reality of global warming, especially in light of 
evidence such as the shrinking ice caps, melting tundra, which releases 
methane gases that accelerate climate change, and a growing number of killer 
storms, a result of higher ocean surface temperatures.

<p>The RGGI pact would create a 'market-driven system' of tradable carbon 
dioxide emissions permits for hundreds of electric generators in the seven 
northeastern states.  Each state would have its own emissions cap, and power 
plant operators would each be permitted to emit carbon dioxide up to a 
certain level.  The intent is to promote the use of the cleaner plants in 
order to stay under the limits; operators would be allowed to sell excess 
allowances.  A recent study commissioned by the states found that if money 
raised by the sale of the excess pollution allowances were invested in 
energy efficiency programs, consumers could save up to $108 a year by the 
year 2021.

<p>"We're calling for all carbon emission permits under RGGI to be auctioned 
off, rather than most of them to be given free to existing carbon 
polluters," said Mark Dunlea, former chair of the Green Party of New York 
State and former national coordinator of the Campaign for Safe Energy.  "The 
hundreds of millions of dollars raised annually through the auction process 
would be used to offset the regressive nature of any 'energy tax', for 
example, through state supplements to the low-income Home Energy Assistance 
Program.  The rest would be invested in energy efficiency, conservation, and 
development of renewable energy technologies."

<p>A recent report by <a href="http://www.fiscalpolicy.org/northeastRGGI.pdf">Redefining Progress</a><http://www.fiscalpolicy.org/northeastRGGI.pdf> shows that auctioning off 
the permits rather than giving them away free would reduce the costs of the 
initiative by 75%.  A grandfathered permit system would reduce employment, 
investment, and competitiveness in northeastern states, while an auctioned 
permit system would increase employment.
