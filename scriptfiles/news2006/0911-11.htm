<p>NEW YORK - September 11 - The terrorist attacks of September 11, 
2001 were not only a tragedy for the victims and their families. They were 
also a searing reminder that radical groups today can commit acts of 
enormous violence and impact. The attacks showed with unmistakable 
clarity the extent to which certain extremist Islamist groups, far from the 
mainstream yet with global ambitions, have internalized the idea that the 
ends justify the means, that any civilian living in a state perceived as 
hostile is a legitimate target. 

<p>One might have expected the governmental response to that threat to 
champion the principle so flouted by the extremists듮he importance of 
not treating people as means to an end but of respecting their rights as 
individual human beings. Governments should have understood the need 
to respect human rights not only because it is the right thing to do but also 
because it provides the only hope of effectively undermining the 
destructive logic of terrorism.   
  
<p>Sadly, the U.S. government never took that insight to heart. As the target 
of the attacks five years ago, no government played a more important role 
in shaping the global response to terrorism. Yet Washington's response 
instead reinforced the dangerous view that laudable ends can justify brutal 
means.   
  
<p>Following the terrorist attacks, many Americans understandably wanted 
their government to do anything possible that might protect them from 
terrorism. The Bush administration exploited that fear to push through 
various measures with scant regard to international human rights 
standards. Systematic prisoner abuse, widespread detention without trial, 
and proposed kangaroo courts were the result. Abu Ghraib, Guant烱amo, 
and secret CIA prisons became the unfortunate symbols of U.S. 
counterterrorism efforts. Even within the United States, the rights of many 
Muslim men were compromised through the misuse of laws such as those 
on detaining immigrants and 늜aterial witnesses." Governments around 
the world, in turn, exploited the U.S. government's example to launch or 
defend repression of their own.   
  
<p>These abuses are wrong as a matter of fundamental rights. Though done in 
the name of protection from terrorism, they are also counterproductive. 
Fighting terrorism effectively requires not just stopping existing terrorists 
but also preventing the generation of new ones. By all accounts, U.S. 
abuses in the name of fighting terrorism have been a boon to terrorist 
recruiters. The loss of the moral high ground has made it harder to 
dissuade angry young men from resorting to the deliberate killing of 
civilians.   
  
<p>Many of the abuses also reflect a counterterrorism strategy that is too 
narrow. Most experts insist that, in comparison with other law 
enforcement methods such as surveillance or searches, information 
garnered from interrogation plays a relatively small role in cracking 
secretive criminal conspiracies. The most important source of all is tips 
from members of the general public듪rdinary citizens, often from the 
same community as a would-be terrorist, who might report suspicious 
activity next door or the approach of a terrorist recruiter. Abusive 
interrogation can discourage such cooperation because many potential 
sources of information want nothing to do with 늓irty war" tactics that 
may be used against their neighbors or even themselves. Cooperation from 
other governments can be similarly undermined.   
  
<p>For these practical reasons, and because Americans and people around the 
world are morally outraged by U.S. government tactics, Washington has 
begun to change its approach. The U.S. Supreme Court rejected the Bush 
administration's attempts to exclude Guant烱amo from U.S. legal 
protections or to prosecute alleged terrorists before military commissions 
that violate the Geneva Conventions. The U.S. Congress rejected a Bush 
administration claim that the prohibition of cruel, inhuman or degrading 
treatment does not protect non-Americans held by U.S. forces outside the 
United States. These developments, coupled with revelations of the CIA's 
secret detention centers and growing public pressure, led President Bush 
to close those secret prisons, at least for the moment. Uniformed members 
of the U.S. military, successfully resisting pressure from their civilian 
superiors, have reaffirmed rules against the abusive techniques that those 
superiors had authorized.   
  
<p>Yet major battles remain:  
 
<p>*	The Bush administration still subscribes to the view that it is 
engaged in a 늖lobal" war, so suspects can be detained as 는nemy 
combatants" anywhere in the world, including the United States, 
and held without charge or trial until the end of the 능ar against 
terrorism," which may never come. That theory threatens the basic 
rights of us all. 
 
<p>*	Even though it has now been reaffirmed that U.S. law clearly 
outlaws all forms of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, the 
administration is trying to decriminalize such mistreatment to 
protect anyone who has authorized or deployed it in the last five 
years.
 
<p>*	The administration still claims the right to send suspects to 
countries that regularly torture, hiding behind the fig leaf that a 
government's mere diplomatic promise to treat suspects well, with 
little more, is credible even when that government regularly flouts 
major multilateral treaties against torture.
 
<p>*	The administration is still pressing for trials before military 
commissions where suspects could be convicted and even executed 
on the basis of evidence they never see, witnesses they never 
confront, and testimony that has been forcibly extracted.
 
<p>*	The administration has never repudiated the view that the president 
as commander-in-chief can ignore or even violate laws that protect 
fundamental rights.
  
  
<p>The arguments advanced to defend these ongoing abuses are weak. No one 
denies that terrorist incidents should be prevented as well as punished, but 
existing criminal laws allow the government to stop terrorist plans before 
they are carried out. No one denies that military force must sometimes be 
used against terrorist groups, but that does not justify pretending that the 
entire world is a battlefield where criminal justice rights can be suspended. 
No one denies that protecting intelligence sources and methods is 
important, but existing U.S. courts, both civilian and military, have done 
that well for decades, even in the face of raging wars and serious security 
threats.   
  
<p>The important goal of curbing terrorism does not justify a response 
without limits. So for reasons of pragmatism as well as principle, the best 
way to mark the fifth anniversary of September 11 would be with a 
rejection of the logic of terrorism and a renewed commitment to human 
rights. The rights of people matter. The ends do not justify any means. 
Respecting human rights드nd encouraging other governments to do the 
same들s not only the right way to curb terrorism but also the most 
effective.
