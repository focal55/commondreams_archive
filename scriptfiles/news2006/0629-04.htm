<p>WASHINGTON - June 29 - Congressman Dennis J. Kucinich (D-OH) gave the following speech today on the House floor: 

<p>"This Administration is angry that the media leaked the story about it snooping into the bank records of millions of Americans.  It supporters in Congress want to formally condemn the New York Times.  What a bunch of baloney.

<p>"It is about time the media did its job of protecting the public interest. If the media and this Congress had shown some independence from the party line of this Administration, the claims of  WMDs would have been dismissed, and fact there was no connection between Iraq and 9/11 would have been well established and we would not have gone to war against Iraq.

<p>"A few years ago, a movie, Wag the Dog, told of how a US administration misused its communications power to create phony stories to put the nation into an international conflict.   This Administration not only wagged the dog in Iraq, but, with the help of its fabricators at the Rendon and Lincoln groups, it has wagging a whole kennel.

<p>"In a free society the media cannot be a lap dog of any Administration.  The First Amendment states, 'Congress shall make no law abridging freedom of speech', except of course, under this Administration."
