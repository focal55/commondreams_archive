<p>WASHINGTON - March 2 - 
<p><b><a href="mailto:guptahr@yahoo.com">VINEETA GUPTA, M.D.</a></b><br />
Gupta is director of the Stop HIV/AIDS in India Initiative. She said today: "As a physician and human rights lawyer who worked in the slums and rural areas for 18 years, I want legal and policy changes that would make medicines more affordable and accessible to poor people, especially those suffering from HIV/AIDS. U.S pressure on India is making that goal farther."<br />

<b><a href="mailto:tangri@econjustice.net">NEIL TANGRI</a></b><br />
Tangri is Asia/Africa Organizer for the Center for Economic Justice. He said today: "Obviously, the U.S. right and the Hindutva right like the idea of a joint war on Islam, but it even predates 9-11. The U.S. is turning India into a regional military satrap as a counterbalance to China. Of course, India, with $140 billion in foreign exchange in its coffers, is also a plump target for U.S. military contractors. It's also important, from an Indian perspective, to note how this visit is the capstone to the complete domination of neo-liberalism [corporate globalization]. Even as it appears to be on the wane in Latin America, in India it's becoming even more dominant, in large part because the educated classes have seen financial benefits from the opening of the economy in the last 15 years, and they identify the U.S. as the source and symbol of their new wealth."<br />
