<p>WASHINGTON - September 22 - Eight retired senior agents of the Federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms &amp; Explosives, including two former ATF chiefs, and two of the nation&rsquo;s most prominent police groups today sent letters to members of Congress urging them to oppose a bill, H.R. 5092, that would weaken federal powers to crack down on gun dealers who violate the law.<br />
<br />
The retired ATF leaders wrote the legislation &ldquo;would severely undermine the Bureau and protect corrupt gun dealers.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Major Cities (Police) Chiefs Association said the bill &ldquo;would have a devastating effect on the ability of law enforcement to stem the flow of firearms from lawbreaking gun dealers to violent criminals.&rdquo; <br />
<br />
The International Brotherhood of Police Officers (IBPO) wrote &ldquo;a vote for H.R. 5092 in any form is a vote against police officers.&rdquo;<br />
<br />
The letters are available at www.BradyCampaign.org/action/trafficking/ <br />
&nbsp;<br />
Yesterday, the House leadership indicated that the bill, H.R. 5092, Could be brought up as soon as Monday for a final vote.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
&ldquo;Supporters of this bill have waged a campaign of utter deception about what it would do,&rdquo; said Paul Helmke, President of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence.&nbsp; &ldquo;They say it would strengthen federal enforcement.&nbsp; In fact, the bill would decimate federal power to shut down the most irresponsible gun pushers, leading to more guns in the hands of criminals.&rdquo;<br />
<br />
The ATF veterans, including former ATF Directors Stephen Higgins and Rex Davis, wrote that the bill would &ldquo;protect lawbreakers, at the expense of public safety&rdquo; by requiring ATF to meet an &ldquo;extraordinary burden of proof&rdquo; to revoke the licenses of dealers who violate the law.&nbsp; They also wrote that, although the bill would give ATF the authority to levy fines and impose suspensions against dealers, the legislation &ldquo;places such severe impediments on ATF&rsquo;s ability to impose these sanctions as to make them nearly meaningless.&rdquo; <br />
<br />
Major Chiefs Association President Harold Hurtt wrote &ldquo;it is not hard to see the devastating effect that H.R. 5092 would have on law enforcement around the country&hellip; If ATF is unable to revoke the licenses of corrupt gun dealers, our communities will continue to be flooded with firearms from these irresponsible gun sellers.&rdquo;<br />
<br />
IBPO Legislative Affairs Director Steve Lenkart wrote &ldquo;this senseless legislation would serve only to cripple law enforcement&rsquo;s ability to track and prevent the flow of illegal guns across the country.&rdquo; <br />
<br />
H.R. 5092, misnamed the ATF &ldquo;Modernization and Reform Act of 2006,&rdquo; would cripple ATF&rsquo;s ability to crack down on the nation&rsquo;s worst gun dealers by reclassifying a host of serious federal gun law violations as &ldquo;minor,&rdquo; and raising the burden of proof to require ATF to show gun dealers specifically intended to break the law.&nbsp; The legislation would add to the supply of illegal guns available to criminals, since studies show that about one percent of the Nation&rsquo;s gun dealers supply almost sixty percent of the guns traced to crime.<br />
<br />
Earlier this week, the Brady organization issued a study which dismantled the gun industry claim that federal law enforcement authorities penalize gun dealers for mere &ldquo;trivial violations&rdquo; of gun laws unrelated to public safety.&nbsp; Instead the study found that federal action against gun dealers typically occurs only after numerous, consistent and serious violations of the law.&nbsp; The study - &ldquo;Trivial Violations&rdquo;?:&nbsp; The Myth of Overzealous Federal Enforcement Actions Against Licensed Gun Dealers, is available on the Brady Campaign website. <br />
<br />
The new report examined every published Federal court decision during the Bush Administration - 21 in all -- in which gun dealers challenged ATF&rsquo;s license termination actions.&nbsp; Instead of &ldquo;trivial violations,&rdquo; the cases are replete with frequent and serious illegal conduct by dealers.<!-- #EndEditable -->
