WASHINGTON - June 7 - The United Steelworkers  (USW), North America's largest private sector manufacturing union  with 850,000 members, and the Sierra Club, the nation's largest  grassroots environmental organization with 750,000 members,  announced today the formation of a strategic alliance to pursue a  joint public policy agenda under the banner of Good Jobs, A Clean  Environment, and A Safer World.</p>
<p>   &quot;The Blue/Green Alliance is one of the most important  initiatives undertaken by the environmental movement in decades,&quot;  said Carl Pope, executive director of the Sierra Club. &quot;We have  reached a point in the development of a global economy where we  can either use our planet's resources for long-term  sustainability or to create an ever more dangerous polarization  of wealth and poverty.  Our new alliance allows us to address the  great challenge of the global economy in the 21st next century --  how to provide good jobs, a clean environment and a safer world.&quot;</p>
<p>   &quot;Good jobs and a clean environment are important to American  workers -- we cannot have one without the other, said Leo Gerard,  International President of USW.  &quot;In fact, secure 21st century  jobs are those that will help solve the problem of global warming  with energy efficiency and renewable energy.&quot;</p>
<p>   A joint resolution establishing the Blue/Green Alliance was  signed by Gerard and Pope, declaring that, &quot;This alliance will  focus its resources on those issues which have the greatest  potential to unite the American people in pursuit of a global  economy that is more just and equitable and founded on principles  of environmental and economic sustainability.&quot;</p>
<p>   Gerard and Pope also announced their intention to launch a  &quot;New Vision for America&quot; tour designed to highlight the economic  benefits of dealing with global warming.  The tour will feature  events in several cities across the country whose mayors have  embraced the Climate Protection Agreement, a movement of more  than 200 U.S. mayors who have vowed to take action in support of  the Kyoto Treaty on global warming.</p>
<p>   Mayor R.T. Rybak of Minneapolis, one of the signers of the  Climate Protection Agreement, said, &quot;This alliance between the  Steelworkers and the Sierra Club is exactly what America needs to  help promote positive choices.  We can have stable jobs based on  sound environmental principles.  I look forward to welcoming the  'New Vision' tour to Minneapolis.&quot;</p>
<p>   The USW and the Sierra Club have worked jointly on issues of  mutual concern for many years, including the Clean Air Act, trade  reform, and corporate responsibility.  Currently, the two  organizations have joint projects in fifteen states.  The new  Alliance will build on these existing programs and focus  initially on three key issues-global warming and clean energy,  fair trade, and reducing toxics.  The work will begin in four  states-Pennsylvania, Minnesota, Ohio, and Washington with plans  to expand into at least 10 more states in the next two years.</p>
<p>   The Alliance will be headquartered in Minneapolis, MN in the  USW District 11 office.  The first Executive Director of the  Alliance will be David Foster, former District 11 Director of the  USW.  The Alliance's Blue/Green organizers will be housed in USW  offices around the country.</p>
<p>   The USW also released its new Environmental Policy Statement  in conjunction with the Alliance announcement.  Carl Pope called  the statement, &quot;the most important environmental statement to be  issued by any trade union in North America-and indeed would make  most environmental groups proud. American public policy debate is  deeply polarized and paralyzed today.  By reaching across the  divides of class and geography, the Sierra Club and Steelworkers  are showing that there is another way. &quot;</p>
<p>   The document provides North American workers with a strategic  vision on how to fight for both job security and an improved  quality of life.  North American workers know that the global  economy is not being managed in their interest.</p>
<p>   Leo Gerard concluded, &quot;We believe that the complex problems of  a global society are interrelated and that a coalition such as  ours can focus the country's attention on the positive solutions- whether global warming or outsourcing, public health or public  safety, or workers' rights and environmental standards.</p>
