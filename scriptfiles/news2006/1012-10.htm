<p>WASHINGTON - October 12 - U.S. Senator Russ Feingold (D-WI) today joined 
          a number of his Senate colleagues in calling for funding for the COPS 
          in Schools Program to be restored for the current fiscal year. The letter 
          was sent to Senators Richard Shelby and Barbara Mikulski, Chairman and 
          Ranking Member of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Science, 
          State, Justice, Commerce, and Related Agencies. The COPS in Schools 
          program, originally implemented in the wake of the 1999 tragedy in Littleton, 
          Colorado, provides officers with specialized training to help them prevent 
          and deal with school violence. The President&#8217;s budget proposal 
          has provided no funding for this program for five years in a row, and 
          Congress eliminated funding for the program in 2006. The program&#8217;s 
          services are vital to creating a safe learning atmosphere for our nation&#8217;s 
          schoolchildren, teachers, and administrators. 
<p>&#8220;The tragic incidents of school violence we have seen in recent 
          weeks only confirm the need for this program,&#8221; Feingold said. 
          &#8220;Congress needs to consider the safety of our children and teachers 
          and provide the necessary funding for this program.&#8221;</p>
        <p>The letter, led by Senator Joseph Biden (D-DE), was sent in light of 
          recent school tragedies, including incidents in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, 
          and Colorado. Since its creation, the COPS in Schools Program has deployed 
          more than 6,424 School Resource Officers in schools nationwide. The 
          officers are specially trained to operate in schools, to utilize community 
          policing techniques to prevent violence, and to ensure a rapid, coordinated 
          response if an incident does occur. </p>
        <p>&#8220;With the tight budgets faced by local school boards and local 
          law enforcement, the federal government must do what it can to help 
          protect the health and safety our children,&#8221; Feingold said. &#8220;No 
child should have to fear for his or her safety at school.&#8221; <!-- #EndEditable -->
