<p>WASHINGTON - September 25 - The Consumer Federation of America today announced its
participation in a broad-based coalition of consumer advocates, public health advocates,
patient groups, trade associations and companies dedicated to increasing resources for the
U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The Coalition for a Stronger FDA has come
together to work with the Administration and Congress to ensure that the FDA has the
resources it needs to protect the public health.
<p>“Funding for the FDA has been gradually eroded over the past several years and
the cracks are starting to show,” said Chris Waldrop, Deputy Director for the Food Policy
Institute at Consumer Federation of America.
<p>While the recent E. coli O157:H7 outbreak linked to spinach has highlighted the
need for increased FDA resources to protect the public from food borne illness, food
safety is not the only concern. The FDA regulates a vast array of consumer products and
oversees numerous public health initiatives. Without adequate funding, the Agency is
unable to meet these responsibilities, putting consumers at undue risk.
The Coalition for a Stronger FDA has two main goals: 1) to ensure that the FDA
has sufficient resources to protect consumers and patients and 2) to maintain public
confidence and trust in the FDA.
<p>“Consumers depend on the FDA to ensure the safety of the food they eat, the
drugs they take, and the cosmetics and medical devices they use,” Waldrop said. “It is
absolutely essential that FDA have the resources it needs to meet these obligations.”
