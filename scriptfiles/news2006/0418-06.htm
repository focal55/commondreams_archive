<p>MINNEAPOLIS, Minnesota - April 18 - <p>A new study released today by the Manhattan Institute for Policy Research came under criticism from the Economic Policy Institute’s president and education research director, Lawrence Mishel, for perpetuating the seriously flawed data and methodology of previous studies by the Institute’s Senior Fellow, Jay Greene.</p>

<p>Greene’s new study only offers updated numbers based on the same flawed data and methodology that yielded his earlier inaccurate results, according to Mishel. He explained that the other data available on high school completion, ignored by Greene, are far more reliable, far more consistent with each other, and show significantly higher graduation rates than the school enrollment data Greene relies on. Second, Mishel said that Greene’s computations show an artificially low graduation rate because he does not fully correct for grade retention, especially among minorities, in 9th and 10th grade.</p>

<p>EPI's own report on graduation rates - <span class="italic">Rethinking High School Graduation Rates</span> - will be released Thursday and offers a more reliable look at trends nationwide.</p>
