<p>NEW YORK - August 17 - A federal district judge  in Detroit today struck down the President's warrantless domestic  spying program operated by the National Security Agency.  The  decision by Judge Anna Diggs Taylor is yet another setback for  the President's claim of unchecked executive power, and an  important victory for the rule of law.</p>
<p>   The Brennan Center for Justice at NYU School of Law applauds  Judge Taylor's decision.  The Brennan Center filed a friend-of- the-court brief in the case on behalf of the National Association  for the Advancement of Colored People (&quot;NAACP&quot;) and other leading  civil rights organizations, urging the court to invalidate the  domestic spying program.</p>
<p>   As the Brennan Center brief explained, Democratic and  Republican administrations alike engaged in warrantless  electronic surveillance of Americans engaged in completely  legitimate activities, chilling the exercise of core  constitutional rights and undermining the work of civil rights  organizations across the country. These abuses were exposed in  the mid-1970s by a U.S. Senate committee investigation, known as  the Church Committee. The Brennan Center's Senior Counsel, Fritz  Schwarz, served as chief counsel to the Committee.</p>
<p>   Judge Taylor recounted this history in rejecting the  President's claim that he can disregard the laws enacted by  Congress and the protections provided under the Constitution.  In  particular, she cited the extensive record developed by the  Church Committee.  She also rebuffed the administration's claim  that claims of secrecy can shield illegality.</p>
<p>   &quot;As the judge's opinion shows, the statute that President Bush  violated was not some abstract legalism,&quot; says Michael Waldman,  the Brennan Center's Executive Director.  &quot;It was created because  of real previous abuses in the name of national security.  This  is a victory for the rule of law.&quot;  Today's decision is the  latest in a series of setbacks in the courts for the Bush  Administration.</p>
<p>   The Liberty and National Security Project of the Brennan  Center works to ensure accountability, transparency, and checks  and balances in the formulation and implementation of national  security policy. It is founded on the belief that these are vital  for individual liberties and an effective and sustainable  counter-terrorism strategy.</p>
