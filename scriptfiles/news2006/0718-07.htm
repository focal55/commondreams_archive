<p>WASHINGTON - July 18 -  

The nonprofit Center for Science in the Public Interest will convene policy makers and scientists from industry and government to discuss the makeup of the advisory committees that provide science-based advice to the Food and Drug Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency and the federally chartered National Academies. 

<p><b>WHAT:</b> Moderated panel on federal advisory committees, and whether their members should include representatives who have financial ties to companies that may have a stake in the proceedings. 

<p><b>WHO: </b><br>


-- Moderator: Snigdha Prakash, National Public Radio<br>
 

-- Dr. Scott Gottlieb, deputy commissioner, FDA <br>


-- Dr. Steven Nissen, former chair, FDA Cardiovascular and Renal Drugs Advisory Committee, The Cleveland Clinic Foundation 
<br>

-- Merrill Goozner, director, Integrity in Science, CSPI <br>


-- Dr. David Michaels, professor, George Washington University <br>


-- James Conrad, the assistant chief counsel for the American Chemistry Council 


<p><b>WHEN:</b> 1 p.m. to 2:30 p.m. EDT on Monday, July 24

<p><b>WHERE:</b> National Press Club, Holeman Lounge, 529 14th St. NW, Washington, D.C. 

<p><b>WHY:</b> Congress is considering legislation that would prohibit the Food and Drug Administration from appointing scientists with ties to drug manufacturers to its science advisory panels. The Environmental Protection Agency routinely appoints such scientists to its committees, and public interest groups are raising similar concerns about the National Academy of Sciences (NAS). CSPI release a report on the NAS' practices on this day.
