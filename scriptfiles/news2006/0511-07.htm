<p>WASHINGTON - May 11 - <SPAN>On May 11, </SPAN><SPAN>America</SPAN><SPAN> will celebrate Endangered Species Day and endangered species success stories, including the protection and recovery of the American bald eagle, gray wolf, peregrine falcon, American alligator and many other fish, plants and wildlife.</SPAN>
<P><SPAN>The U.S. Senate has unanimously proclaimed May 11 as “Endangered Species Day,” providing for the first-ever national celebration of </SPAN><SPAN>America</SPAN><SPAN>’s commitment to protecting our unique wildlife. The Senate resolution encourages all Americans to “become educated about, and aware of, threats to species, success stories in species recovery, and the opportunity to promote species conservation worldwide.” </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN>“This first-ever Endangered Species Day gives us a chance to celebrate </SPAN><SPAN>America</SPAN><SPAN>’s commitment to protecting our unique wildlife,” said Sarah Matsumoto of the Endangered Species Coalition. “Endangered Species Day is a great opportunity for young and old alike to learn about our nation’s wildlife and get involved in protecting endangered species and their habitat.”</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN>The goal of Endangered Species Day is simple—to educate people about the importance of protecting our rare, threatened, and endangered animal and plant species. Endangered Species Day will provide an opportunity for schools, libraries, museums, zoos, aquariums, botanical gardens, agencies, businesses, community groups and conservation organizations to educate the public about the importance of protecting endangered species and highlight the everyday actions that individuals and groups can take to help protect our nation’s wildlife, fish and plants.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN>A list of Endangered Species Day events and activities can be found at: <a href="http://www.stopextinction.org/endangeredspeciesday">www.stopextinction.org/endangeredspeciesday</A>.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN>“Across the country, </SPAN><SPAN>America</SPAN><SPAN>’s symbol, the Bald Eagle has made a remarkable recovery thanks to efforts to protect these birds and their homes,” said Betsy Loyless with the National Audubon Society. “Without these efforts, we might have lost the Bald Eagle forever. Our commitment to protecting rare wildlife ensures that Americans can enjoy seeing eagles soar across our skies for generations to come.”</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN>One reason for the nation’s success in protecting wildlife is the passage, 33 years ago, of the federal Endangered Species Act. The Endangered Species Act has successfully prevented the extinction of hundreds of species, including the bald eagle, whooping crane, grizzly bear and Pacific salmon.<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>Many of our nation’s signature species, such as the </SPAN><SPAN>Florida</SPAN><SPAN> manatee, </SPAN><SPAN>Kirkland</SPAN><SPAN>’s warbler, California condor and Hawaiian monk seal, owe their continued existence to the protections of the Act.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN>The resounding success of the Act shows in the fact that </SPAN><SPAN>only two percent of the more than 1800 listed species went extinct after listing while the great majority increased in size and are on the road to recovery.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN>"The Endangered Species Act provides a safety net for animals and plants on the brink of extinction," said Larry Schweiger, President of the National Wildlife Federation. "Our children and grandchildren deserve to inherit a wildlife legacy we can be proud of."</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN>"Today is also a day to step back and recognize all the great achievements of the Endangered Species Act," said Carl Pope, Sierra Club Executive Director. "The fish, wildlife and plants that we celebrate today have teetered at the brink of extinction but found the road to recovery thanks to these important protections."</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN>Endangered Species Day will raise awareness about the ongoing threats to endangered species, and the Act’s tremendous success in helping species to recover. It also provides an opportunity to learn more about the wide variety of actions that individuals and groups can take to help protect our nation’s wildlife, including building backyard wildlife habitat, protecting water quality, and supporting local efforts to clean up rivers, parks, and other natural areas. </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN>“We should all give thanks that </SPAN><SPAN>America</SPAN><SPAN> had the foresight to take the steps necessary to ensure that our children and grandchildren will continue to be thrilled by our nation’s unique wildlife,” said Michael Bean, Chair of the Wildlife Program at Environmental Defense. “With more than 1,800 species worldwide now listed as threatened and endangered, and thousands more threatened with extinction unless they are protected, </SPAN><SPAN>America</SPAN><SPAN>’s commitment to protecting wildlife is more important than ever.”</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN>“We believe that we have a responsibility to protect wildlife, plants and fish that are on the brink of extinction,” said Wayne Carley, Executive Director of the National Association of Biology Teachers.<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>“We owe it to our children and grandchildren to be good stewards of the environment and leave behind a legacy of protecting endangered species and the special places they call home.”</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN>“We encourage Americans to celebrate Endangered Species Day with us,” said David Robinson, the Endangered Species Day organizer. “There are a wide variety of actions that individuals and groups can take to help protect our nation’s wildlife, including building backyard wildlife habitat, protecting water quality, and supporting local efforts to clean up rivers, parks, and other natural areas.”</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN>“The gray wolf now roams many parts of its historic range,” said Kieran Suckling of the Center for Biological Diversity.&nbsp; “Americans can now once again experience the howl of a wolf in </SPAN><SPAN>Yellowstone</SPAN><SPAN>.&nbsp; However, in order to ensure the wolf’s continued success, it is up to us to protect both the wolf and the places it calls home.”</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN>"Aveda has been committed to preserving and protecting endangered species for the last two years during Earth Month," says Mary Tkach, Aveda's Executive Director for Environmental Sustainability. "Every Earth Month, we energize our global spa, experience centers and salon network to raise funds and gather petitions for environmental causes, so to see Endangered Species Day recognized nationally is truly inspirational." </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN>During Earth Month 2005, the Aveda network doubled its 100,000-signature goal by collecting more than 235,000 signatures in support of endangered species worldwide and raised almost $1.1million - in just one month. This year's results are not yet in, but the Company hopes to collect 275,000 signatures and raise more than $1.5 million. </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN>The Endangered Species Day resolution, passed April 5, was introduced by Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), and cosponsored by Senators Biden (D-DE), Byrd (D-WV) Cantwell (D-WA), Chafee (R-RI), Clinton (D-NY), Collins (R-ME), Crapo (R-ID), Dodd (D-CT), Feingold (D-WI), Levin (D-MI), Lieberman (D-CT), Reed (D-RI), and Snowe (R-ME).<B></B></SPAN></P>
