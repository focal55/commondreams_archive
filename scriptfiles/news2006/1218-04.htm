<p>WASHINGTON - December 18 - Activists from  Seattle's Ethiopian community, local group Fair Trade  Puget Sound and Oxfam are demonstrating today outside  the Westlake Center Starbucks to protest against the  company's refusal to recognize the rights of Ethiopian  coffee farmers.  This is part of a day of action to  send a message of solidarity with Ethiopian farmers to  the coffee giant.</p>
<p>   More than 89,000 people in 70 countries have now  joined Oxfam's campaign by faxing Starbucks CEO Jim  Donald, asking the company to stop dragging its feet  and to support Ethiopia's ownership of its coffee  names.  Today's international action is further proof  of the strength of support worldwide for Ethiopia's  attempts to help millions of farmers who produce world- class coffee but who continue to live in poverty.</p>
<p>   Between 11 a.m. and 1 p.m. activists are leafleting  and carrying the image of an Ethiopian coffee farmer (  <a href="http://releases.usnewswire.com/redir.asp?ReleaseID=77730&Link=http://www.oxfamamerica.org/resources/images/OA_Starbucks_Sandwichboard.jpg">http://www.oxfamamerica.org/resources/images/OA_Starbucks_Sandwichboard.jpg</a></p>
<p>) on sandwich board  fronts, with the backside reading, "For every cup of  Ethiopian coffee Starbucks sells, Ethiopian farmer earn  3 cents. Tell Starbucks: Honor your commitments to  coffee farmers."

<p>   In addition, an Ethiopian coffee ceremony is taking  place in Westlake Park (weather permitting). A  traditional part of Ethiopian culture, the ceremony is  often done for visiting friends or on holidays, and is  considered a blessing for those participating.</p>
<p>   "The strength of feeling about this issue is obvious  from the number of Starbucks customers who have spoken  out already," said Seth Petchers, Oxfam's Make Trade  Fair campaign coffee lead. "Knowing that farmers only  receive around three cents for a three dollar cup of  coffee leaves a bitter taste with customers."</p>
<p>   "Starbucks must demonstrate that their much  publicized commitment to the welfare of the farmers who  provide it with world-class coffee is genuine by  acknowledging Ethiopia's ownership of its coffee names  and signing the agreement on the table," concluded  Petchers.</p>
<p>   On Oct. 26, Oxfam launched a campaign to encourage  Starbucks to sign a licensing agreement with Ethiopia.  The agreement would acknowledge Ethiopia's ownership  over its specialty coffee names, Harar, Sidamo and  Yirgacheffe.  Ownership over the names would result in  greater control over how the beans are marketed and the  price of the beans, which would ultimately result in a  great share of the profits getting back to the 15  million poor people in Ethiopia who are dependent upon  the coffee sector.</p>
<p>   For more than a year, Ethiopia sought a dialogue  with Starbucks about supporting the country's efforts  to return more of the price of its coffees in world  markets to the farmers who produce them by seeking  trademark rights for Sidamo, Harar and Yirgacheffe  coffees. Despite its professed commitment to farming  communities, Starbucks has continually rejected  Ethiopia's requests to resolve the trademark issue, and  has refused to sign a royalty-free licensing agreement  that would recognize Ethiopia's right to control how  its own coffee names are used.</p>
<p>   A press release issued by the Ethiopian Intellectual  Property Office shortly after a meeting late last month  between the Ethiopian Prime Minister and Starbucks CEO  Jim Donald acknowledged that while the meeting with  Starbucks was an encouraging step, "Starbucks has not  yet recognized Ethiopia's trademark ownership of the  specialty coffee names..."</p>
<p>   Legal and intellectual property experts have  supported Ethiopia in its approach, expressing the  opinion that the trademark and licensing project is a  viable solution to the poverty that plagues Ethiopian  farmers. Trademark protection for Ethiopia's coffees  has already been recognized in several European  countries, as well as Canada and Japan.</p>
<p>   In addition to public events, activists throughout  the world will be taking individual actions and  visiting their local Starbucks to talk to baristas  about the Ethiopian trademark issue.
