<p>WASHINGTON - July 11 - Reacting to the leaked “Draft Plan of Action on Energy Security” for the Group of Eight’s June 15 summit in St. Petersburg, Russia, a coalition of youth from 21 countries in six continents has issued a statement urging the G8 to rethink their position, which recommends spending trillions on nonrenewable energy.   Acting in defense of their future, young people also plan to demonstrate in Washington, D.C., St. Petersburg, and elsewhere.

<p>According to the statement, the leaked document “defines energy security as being able to provide for growing energy demands through fossil fuels and nuclear energy” and proposes investing $17 trillion in infrastructure for these unsustainable sources.  The coalition argues that this massive investment in energy sources that have proven to exacerbate the already pressing problem of global warming and pose significant safety risks will “lock the world into a massive increase in greenhouse gas emissions that can only lead to dangerous and irreversible global climate change,” ultimately jeopardizing their future and the future of the earth.

<p>The coalition is not alone in opposing the “Plan of Action.”  Top world scientists from science academies in the G8 countries, along with China, Brazil, India and South Africa, have themselves urged the G8 to reconsider their position on energy security in a June 14 statement.   In addition, the G8’s own Communique on Climate Change, Clean Energy and Sustainable Development from last year’s meetings in the UK committed the eight economic powerhouses to pursue renewable energy sources and curb demand.  

<p>Though the G8 seems poised to ignore its own council and the council of top scientists, the youth are determined to be heard.  They see the G8’s shortsighted decision to be a quick and ultimately disastrous solution to energy shortages. “Young people will have to bear the brunt of climate chaos, and it is simply irresponsible for the leaders of the world to turn their backs on our generation,” said Mike Hudema, Independence from Oil director at the human rights group Global Exchange. “The technology to begin transitioning the developed countries of the world to a more sustainable energy base already exists.  Wind power, for example, has even reached a price inversion point, so it’s cost-effective in addition to clean.  It’s time for the most powerful people in the world to have the vision and leadership to take us in a direction that won’t sell out our future for a quick and dirty fix.”

<p>The statement precedes a series of international actions against the G8 in St. Petersburg and beyond. In the U.S., large demonstrations are expected in Washington, DC leading up to July 15.  From Southern Indiana to Appalachia to Washington, D.C., as President Bush flies to Russia, young people will pursue the alternatives to a society based on nonrenewable energy and its corollaries: international warfare, violence in oil-producing countries, and climate chaos.  Internationally, in Maracaibo, Venezuela; and Grassy Narrows, Canada; young people will join with indigenous communities to prevent mining and logging operations, respectively.

<p>The Statement Against the Draft “Plan of Action on Global Energy Security”  has been endorsed by youth organizations in Australia, the U.S.A., Canada, Bahrain, Turkey, Bulgaria, Thailand, Niger, Burkina Faso, Togo, Germany, Sweden,  Zimbabwe, Nigeria, Brazil, Argentina, China, Guyana, Japan, the UK, and Peru.
