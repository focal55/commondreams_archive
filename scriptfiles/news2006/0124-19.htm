<p>WASHINGTON - January 24 - The U.S. Supreme Court today refused to hear a case with enormous implications for many of the nation’s state judges who stand for election. The decision will exacerbate the rising tide of money and politics flooding into America’s courtrooms, and ratchet up special interest pressure on courts that are supposed to be fair and impartial.  
 
<p>In Dimick v. Republican Party of Minnesota (No. 05-566), the Supreme Court refused to review a decision by the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals striking down much of two ethics rules governing the conduct of candidates in Minnesota’s judicial campaigns. Judges will now be free to make some personal solicitations for campaign funds and to engage in a wider range of partisan political activities.   

 

<p>“Three in four Americans already believe that campaign contributions affect the outcome of decisions - and one in four state judges agrees,” said Bert Brandenburg, executive director of the Justice at Stake Campaign. The figures come from national polls released in 2002.  “The Eighth Circuit’s decision further reduces the safeguards that have protected judges from special interest pressure,” he added.     
 
<p>The Supreme Court had been urged to reverse the Eighth Circuit decision by the Conference of Chief Justices, a separate group of former state chief justices, the attorney generals of ten states (Missouri, North Dakota, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Dakota, West Virginia, and Wisconsin), and the American Judicature Society.  The American Bar Association had also urged the Supreme Court to take the case.
  
<p>Supreme Court candidates in 38 states must stand for some form of election.  In the last three political cycles, these candidates have raised a record $123 million, smashing records in more than a dozen states.    Interest groups are spending millions on candidates and television ads designed to install courts that will rule in their interest, not the public interest.

<p>The decision also frees judges running in nonpartisan elections to engage in many partisan activities.  "Under this decision, Minnesota will soon have judicial elections that are nonpartisan in form but partisan in substance," said Deborah Goldberg, Democracy Program Director at the Brennan Center for Justice at NYU School of Law.  "From our experience in Michigan and Ohio, we know that this is likely to mean more expensive races and more special interest influence."
 
<p>Thirty states are scheduled to hold Supreme Court elections this year.
