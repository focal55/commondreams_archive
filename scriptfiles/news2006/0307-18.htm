<p>WASHINGTON - March 7 - A Web site and artistic designs created by Georgia resident Charles Smith to express his objections to Wal-Mart&#8217;s business practices are not only permissible under trademark law but are speech that should be protected by the First Amendment, Public Citizen said in a lawsuit filed in federal court in Atlanta, Ga. The lawsuit, filed with the American Civil Liberties Union of Georgia Foundation, is&#160;<a href="http://www.citizen.org/documents/Complaint_and_exhibit.pdf">available here.</a></p>

<p align="left">&#160;&#160; Smith, a Conyers resident, created designs critical of Wal-Mart that merged Wal-Mart&#8217;s name with the word &#8220;holocaust&#8221; and a star, and arranged for CafePress.com, a California company, to put the design on T-shirts, hats, bumper stickers and other items for sale on the Internet. Smith reserved the domain name "walocaust.com" and arranged for his items to be sold on CafePress.com.</p>

<p align="left">&#160;&#160; In December 2005, Wal-Mart sent a letter and e-mail to Smith asserting ownership of trademarks in the name Wal-Mart, the star and the &#8220;smiley face&#8221; the company uses. The company threatened to sue Smith for infringing and diluting its trademarks and demanded he stop selling his items. Wal-Mart also demanded that Smith stop using the domain name &#8220;walocaust.com&#8221; and transfer it to Wal-Mart. Wal-Mart made a similar threat to CafePress.com, which immediately stopped making and selling Smith&#8217;s items.</p>

<p align="left">&#160;&#160; In the lawsuit, Public Citizen asserts that although Smith sold his anti-Wal-Mart merchandise, the designs themselves are non-commercial speech &#8211; a type of speech currently protected from trademark infringement and dilution lawsuits. The lawsuit also states that there is no likelihood of confusion about whether Smith&#8217;s designs or Web site are sponsored or affiliated by the retail giant, a common trademark violation claim. The lawsuit requests the court to rule that Smith is not infringing, diluting or cybersquatting on Wal-Mart&#8217;s trademarks because his speech is protected by the First Amendment.</p>

<p align="left">&#160;&#8220;Wal-Mart is using bully tactics to silence its critics,&#8221; said Paul Levy, the Public Citizen attorney representing Smith.&#160;&#8220;Claiming a trademark violation is an abuse of the trademark law. If Wal-Mart were to succeed, this would have a profound effect on every artist, photographer or writer who uses product names to criticize companies.&#8221;&#160; &#160;</p>

<p align="left">Added Gerald Weber, legal director of ACLU of Georgia, &#8220;Citizens should be free to creatively criticize even the biggest of corporations.&#8221;</p>
