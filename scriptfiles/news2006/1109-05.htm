<p>WASHINGTON - November 9 - Larry Cox, Amnesty  International USA's executive director, issued the following  statement on the upcoming fifth anniversary of President Bush's  Military Order authorizing military commissions and treatment of  detainees in U.S. control, originally signed on Nov. 13, 2001:</p>
<p>   &quot;The president boldly asserted presidential powers that have  now been rejected by the nation's highest court and led to failed  policies regarding the detention and trial of suspected  terrorists in U.S. custody. The executive order attempted to give  the president ultimate authority to make all decisions without  regard to U.S. and international law and amounted to a  presidential coronation.  President Bush granted himself the  power to make the laws, execute the laws and try cases according  to his will, with no outside review.</p>
<p>   &quot;The U.S. Supreme Court has rejected this assertion more than  once. In June 2004 and June 2006, the court ruled that detainees  in Guantanamo could access federal court, and that the president  did not have unlimited powers to set up tribunals. In the face of  the court's refusal to vest all powers of government in the  executive branch, the administration went to Congress and asked  members to endorse its reckless policies. In the aftermath of the  Military Commissions Act, the battle has returned to court.</p>
<p>   &quot;Rather than obstinately pushing forward with the same failed  policies, the administration should reverse course and return to  an agenda that embraces human rights. We will never achieve true  security without restoring the rule of law.&quot;</p>
