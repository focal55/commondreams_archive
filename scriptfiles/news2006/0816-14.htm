<p>WASHINGTON - August 16 - Four women peace activists return to the United States on Tuesday, having completed a citizens&#8217; diplomacy mission to the Middle East. The women met with Iraqi parliamentarians in Jordan, and spent five days in Beirut, witnessing the impact of the war and contributing to the humanitarian aid effort. The women are Medea Benjamin of San Francisco, co-founder of the human rights group Global Exchange and the women&#8217;s peace group CodePink; Judith LeBlanc of New York co-chair of the national anti-war coalition United for Peace and Justice; Gael Murphy of Washington, DC, co-founder of CodePink; and Diane Wilson of Texas, a fisherwoman, peace and justice activist, and the author of An Unreasonable Woman.<BR>
&nbsp;<BR>
In Jordan, the women met with officials of the Iraqi government, including official representatives of the Shiite coalition now holding power, the minority Sunni bloc, the anti-occupation Muslim Scholars Association, parliamentarians and torture victims from Abu Ghraib. The meeting, which was also attended by Gold Star mother Cindy Sheehan and former California State Senator Tom Hayden, resulted in an agreement by the Iraqis and Americans present to promote a specific timetable for American withdrawal combined with efforts to &quot;fix the problems&quot; of the occupation as the withdrawal proceeds.<BR>
&nbsp;<BR>

&nbsp;From Jordan, the women traveled to Lebanon via Damascus. They arrived last Monday and proceeded to meet with humanitarian groups and visit improvised refugee camps where internally displaced people from Southern Lebanon and Southern Beirut are living. On her second day in Lebanon, Medea Benjamin said, &#8220;People are terrified. The ones who continue to live in the areas that have been bombed are traumatized - they don&#8217;t know from one day to the next if they&#8217;re going to be alive or if their homes are going to be there. Many people won&#8217;t leave &#8211; they&#8217;re old or disabled or too poor and afraid of losing everything they have &#8230; And the Israelis are pushing up to the Litani River, so people are feeling that the worst is still yet to come. There are bomb blasts every night. Kids have told us that they&#8217;re afraid when it gets dark, because that&#8217;s when the bombing starts &#8230; The refugee camp we&#8217;ve visited doesn&#8217;t have wheelchairs for the elderly &#8211; it&#8217;s just a park where about 1,000 people sleep outside every night &#8211; they don&#8217;t even have tents.&#8221;<BR>
&nbsp;<BR>
&#8220;Although a cease-fire is now in place the situation remains difficult for the many displaced Lebanese,&#8221; says Gael Murphy, co-founder of CodePink, a women&#8217;s peace organization. &#8220;The expansion of war and violence in the region beyond Iraq makes it that much more critical for CodePink women to continue organizing in the US for peaceful alternatives, and to mobilize support for the thousands of innocent civilians trying to recover  in Lebanon and Israel, and trying to survive in Iraq.&#8221;
