<p>WASHINGTON - November 30 - President Bush is  expected to remove protections within the next week for Bristol  Bay, opening what many call America's &quot;Fish Basket&quot; to oil and  gas drilling.  Bristol Bay has been protected from offshore  drilling since 1989 through the Presidential Withdrawal first  declared by President George Herbert Bush in 1990. But the area  is currently included in the Minerals Management Service's 5-year  plan to develop the Outer Continental Shelf for oil and gas  development.</p>
<p>   &quot;We strongly urge President Bush to leave Bristol Bay alone,&quot;  said Carter Roberts, president and CEO of World Wildlife Fund.   &quot;Oil and gas drilling would jeopardize the nation's most  important fishery, hundreds of communities reliant on fishing and  a treasure trove of wildlife.&quot;</p>
<p>   Bristol Bay supports a billion dollar fishery, valuable sport  hunting and fishing industry, Native Alaskan cultural and  subsistence values, and marine wildlife populations. It is also  home to four national wildlife refuges, important herring, crab,  halibut, pollock fisheries and the world's largest runs of  sockeye salmon.  The region also supports many marine mammals  such as walruses, harbor seals, northern sea otters and  endangered species, including stellar sea lions, humpback and fin  whales and the world's most endangered whale species, the north  Pacific population of northern right whales.</p>
<p>   Meanwhile Bristol Bay represents just a minor part of Alaska's  oil and gas potential. Natural gas drilling at Prudhoe Bay --  where the field is delineated and the infrastructure is in place  -- is a much more substantial energy source. </p>
<p>   &quot;Bristol Bay has enjoyed bi-partisan support and protections  for it should remain in place. Bristol Bay is simply the wrong  place for oil and gas drilling,&quot; continued Roberts.  &quot;We are very  concerned that this type of development will harm the ecological  and economic productivity of region.&quot;</p>
<p>   Bristol Bay and the North Aleutian shelf are home to intense  storms with high winds and massive seas through the winter  months. Offshore infrastructure would be exposed to the full fury  of these storms at a time of year when response efforts would be  effectively impossible.  Even the seismic testing required to  find oil and gas reserves is known to disturb marine mammals and  even fish and crab. </p>
