<p>WASHINGTON - January 30 - Members of Military Families Speak Out, an organization of 
3,000 families with loved ones in the military, including those with loved 
ones currently serving in Iraq, about to deploy or re-deploy, and those 
whose loved ones have died as a result of the war in Iraq, are available for 
interview to discuss their reactions to President Bush’s 2006 State of the 
Union Address.
<p>During his 2003 State of the Union address, President Bush outlined the lies 
that took the nation to war in Iraq. Military families and our loved ones, 
along with the Iraqi people, have suffered and are suffering the 
consequences of these lies.

<p>The following are among the Military Families available for interview. For a 
complete list of over 125 military families from 37 states and overseas who 
are available for interview, see www.mfso.org

<p>Nick Bagley of Brooklyn, NY whose brother served with the Marines in Iraq 
for two tours of duty, and was wounded in Fallujah due to lack of sufficient 
body armor. He has since had five operations to repair his stomach.

<p>Amy Campbell-Pittz of Antioch, TN whose husband is in the Army and is 
currently serving under stop-loss orders on his second deployment to Iraq. 
He got his orders right after they sent out wedding invitations, and was 
deployed 16 days after their wedding.

<p>Shawn Greaser of Altoona, PA, whose wife is in the Pennsylvania National 
Guard and is currently serving in Iraq. Shawn and his wife have a 
three-year-old son who his wife has not seen for 13 months, except for a 
20-day leave period.

<p>Susan House of Simi Valley, CA, whose son, Petty Officer 3rd Class John D. 
House, age 28, was killed in a helicopter crash near Ar Rutbah, Iraq on 
January 26, 2005. Susan has still not received his autopsy report or the 
ribbons/medals he should have received for his last deployment. His son was 
born on December 24, 2004; he never got to see or hold him.

<p>Stephany Kern of Westerly, RI, whose son Marine Lance Corporal Nickolas D. 
Schiavoni, 26, was serving his second deployment in Iraq and was killed on 
November 15, 2005, near Fallujah.  He had already earned a purple heart 
during his first deployment.

<p>Katherine King, of Fort Hood, TX, whose husband is in the Army and was 
diagnosed with PTSD and vertigo after two tours in Iraq. He also has heart 
ailments, and two physicians declared him medically undeployable. Despite 
that, he is on his third deployment to Iraq.

<p>Cathy Smith of Liberty, MO, whose eldest son served with the Army’s 1st 
Cavalry Division in Iraq and was struck by an AK-47 round. He is paralyzed 
from the chest down. He is now a member of Iraq Veterans Against the War. 
Cathy Smith’s middle son is currently serving with the Army in Iraq.

<p>Phil and Linda Waste of Shellman Bluff, GA, whose three sons and two 
grandchildren are active-duty military. Together they have served a total of 
80 months on tours of duty in Iraq. Several are currently serving in Iraq or 
have recently returned, and have served extended and multiple deployments.
