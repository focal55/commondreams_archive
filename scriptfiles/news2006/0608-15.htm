<p>“I’m excited to open this round of ‘Pick a Progressive Patriot.’ In the past we have asked the online community for it’s views on whom we should support and I’m happy to give the netroots another opportunity to help direct our campaign contributions. Bloggers have a unique view of the races around the country and I look forward to hearing what they have to say,” Feingold said.


<p>Past winners of the “Pick a Progressive Patriot” contest are John Courage (TX-21) and Bill Winter (CO-6).
