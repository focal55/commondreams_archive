<p>WASHINGTON - April 6 -

<p>   WHEN: Tuesday, April 11 at 12 p.m. (EDT) </p>

<p>   WHO: Center staff: </p>
<p>   -- LaDonna A. Pavetti, senior fellow, Mathematica Policy  Research </p>
<p>   -- Sharon Parrott, director, Welfare Reform and Income  Support, CBPP </p>
<p>   In the wake of enactment in February of the largest changes in  federal welfare policy in a decade, the Center on Budget and  Policy Priorities will hold a conference call briefing on  Tuesday, April 11 at 12 p.m. (ET) to discuss an important new  study that offers lessons to states as they seek to meet the  stricter work requirements that the new law mandates in their  Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF) programs. </p>
<p>   During the call, LaDonna A. Pavetti, co-author of the study  and a nationally recognized welfare expert, will discuss the  demonstration program in Minnesota that the new study examines  and its implications for other states. </p>
<p>   The Minnesota program focuses on identifying long-term TANF  recipients' barriers to employment and developing ways to address  them.  In response to the sharply increased work requirements  that soon will take effect, some states may place TANF recipients  in &quot;one-size-fits-all&quot; work programs.  As the evaluation of the  Minnesota program shows, however, many long-term TANF recipients  do not succeed in such programs because of the formidable  challenges they face, such as mental health problems and low  cognitive functioning. </p>
<p>   This issue is of immediate concern to states.  In June, the  Department of Health and Human Services will issue regulations  governing the new TANF work requirements.  The National Governors  Association recently recommended that states be given flexibility  to design welfare-to-work programs for the kinds of families  targeted by the Minnesota program.  After opening remarks, the  panelists will take questions. </p>
