<p>WASHINGTON - July 11 - Larry Cox, Amnesty  International USA's executive director, issued the following  statement in response to the Department of Defense's announcement  that all detainees in its custody are entitled to protections  under Common Article Three of the Geneva Conventions: </p>
<p>   &quot;Amnesty International welcomes today's announcement that DoD  has accorded detainees under its control protection under Common  Article Three.  The Supreme Court's recent decision to nullify  President Bush's military commissions was clear: that all  detainees must be given fundamental human rights protection.   Amnesty International urges the administration not to gut these  protections by narrowly defining what constitutes outrages on  personal dignity. Today's action is a significant step; however,  we urge that these basic protections apply to all detainees  including those in secret CIA custody. As Amnesty International  has stated before, it is important to adhere to U.S. and  international laws.&quot;   </p>
<p>   Amnesty International continues to call for an independent  commission to investigate all aspects of U.S. detention policies,  including the use of secret detention sites and the practice of  extraordinary rendition.
