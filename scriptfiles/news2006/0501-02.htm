<p>WASHINGTON - May 1 - Dear Senator: All I want  for Mother's Day is for you to vote NO on the Federal Marriage  Amendment...&quot; is the theme of thousands of postcards that will be  sent between today and June 5 to U.S. Senators from members of  Parents, Families and Friends of Lesbians and Gays (PFLAG).</p>
<p>   &quot;A no vote on the Federal Marriage Amendment would be the best  gift any parent could get this year for Mother's Day or Father's  Day,&quot; said Samuel Thoron, National President of PFLAG. &quot;This is  literally giving the gift of fighting discrimination against our  children -- and there's nothing a parent could want more.&quot;</p>
<p>   The new &quot;Dear Senator&quot; campaign is part of a month of high- intensity lobbying by PFLAG members around the U.S. to fight the  Federal Marriage Amendment, which, if passed, would mark the  first step in writing discrimination into the U.S. Constriction  by denying marriage equality to same-sex individuals.</p>
<p>   In addition to the postcard campaign, PFLAG members are  lobbying their congressional representatives on this and other  issues of equality for their gay, lesbian, bisexual and  transgender (GLBT) loved ones this week on Capitol Hill. They  will have family photos in hand and will make more than 30 visits  during the day, culminating with a reception that evening.</p>
<p>   &quot;These visits are being made by PFLAG board members and  Regional Directors -- all volunteers -- who represent the more  than 200,000 members and supporters around the country,&quot; said  Thoron. &quot;Our legislators need to see that we believe in family  values too, to see our photos of the people we do this for -- and  to understand why passing legislation that hurts our GLBT loved  ones is wrong, is un-American and unacceptable.&quot;</p>
<p>   PFLAG members nationwide are also taking the message of  marriage equality and fairness in legislation to their members of  Congress at home. Members from PFLAG's more than 500 chapters are  scheduling in-district meetings as part of their fourth annual  Bringing the Message Home campaign to remind their elected  officials that equality is non-negotiable and that discrimination  against their loved ones affects their families too.</p>
<p>   &quot;Our families are everywhere, and we deserve equality,&quot; said  Thoron. &quot;It is as simple as that.  All of our children should  have of equal treatment, equal protections and equal  opportunities and our elected officials need to know it.&quot;</p>
