<p>WASHINGTON - January 20 - The following is a  statement from Raymond C. Offenheiser, president of Oxfam  America, on Secretary Rice's announcement of USAID restructuring: </p>
<p>   Secretary Rice announced a momentous overhaul of the State  Department and the U.S. Agency for International Development  (USAID) that will certainly change the way the U.S. helps the  poor across the world.  The steps she has proposed as part of her  'Transformational Diplomacy' initiative -- posting more diplomats  in poor countries and crisis zones, focus on teaching more  languages used in the developing world, and ensuring that the  State Department can evolve to face a post-Cold War world are to  be commended.</p>
<p>   As an international organization committed to long term  solutions to poverty and hunger, we want to see U.S. taxpayer  money used as effectively as possible to make the biggest  difference for the billion people across the world that struggle  to survive on just a dollar a day. As an independent organization  that does not pursue or accept USAID funding but works alongside  USAID initiatives, we recognize the magnitude and importance of  this restructuring. </p>
<p>   Indeed, President Bush has made great strides to increase and  restructure overseas assistance. But lives are at stake so we  must proceed cautiously and wisely.  The following four areas of  focus must drive the reform of US foreign aid, ensuring that the  long-term needs of the poor -- not politics -- come first.</p>
<p>   1. The Needs of the Poor, Not Politics, Should Drive Reform of  U.S. Foreign Aid</p>
<p>   Since the attacks of September 11 there has been a drastic  shift in U.S. foreign assistance that has blurred the lines  traditionally separating development and humanitarian aid from  political and military action. It is essential that any plan to  restructure the State Department and USAID does not further erode  the independence of aid groups to fight poverty and respond to  humanitarian emergencies based on the need on-the-ground, not  based on the agenda of the White House or the Pentagon.  </p>
<p>   The safety of NGO staff and the people we are trying to help  is compromised by any perception that development and  humanitarian assistance is a political and military tool.   Secretary Rice and the incoming Administrator of USAID must  publicly affirm the independent nature of development and  humanitarian assistance, and work to restructure USAID in a way  that reflects the core values of independence and impartiality  that should guide development and humanitarian programs. </p>
<p>   2. Building Institutions Should be Cornerstone of U.S. Aid  Strategy</p>
<p>   For far too long, food aid and other forms of assistance that  breed dependence have been large components of U.S. foreign aid.   Secretary Rice should outline a far-reaching yet detailed  strategy for how U.S. money will be used to strengthen economic  systems, government agencies, civil society groups, and basic  infrastructure in poor countries.  Increasing agricultural  production or supporting poor communities through micro-credit  programs is only one part of the solution.  </p>
<p>   Strong local institutions are required to ensure development  at the village level will have results at the national one.   Better roads to bring goods to market, reliable banks where poor  people can save their money and receive credit, and government  institutions where the rights of the most marginalized are  respected and defended are all examples of investments that  encourage sustainability.  </p>
<p>   3. U.S. Aid Budget Must be Increased Dramatically</p>
<p>   Restructuring USAID and America's approach to foreign aid  should be accompanied with further increases in funding for  development and humanitarian assistance.  Although the U.S. is  the largest donor in the world, and U.S. assistance has been on  the increase, the U.S. is lags behind other developed countries  in terms of how much foreign aid we give in proportion to our  huge economy (only 0.16 percent in 2004). </p>
<p>   The type of generational changes Secretary Rice is proposing  requires an equally ambitious vision for increasing the amount of  money we are willing to spend on programs that help the poorest  of the poor get out of poverty.</p>
<p>   4. U.S. Must Adopt Complementary Aid and Trade Policies  Promoting Inclusive Globalization</p>
<p>   U.S. foreign assistance should be accompanied by pro- development policies in other areas, particularly trade.   Secretary Rice's speech today did not mention what the U.S. is  prepared to do to enable poor people in developing countries to  compete fairly in the global marketplace. </p>
<p>   While trade and agriculture have an enormous capacity to help  poor countries develop, the unfair trading system currently in  place is holding them back.  For example, if Africa increased its  share of world trade by just one per cent, it could make five  times the amount it currently receives in aid.  But this  opportunity is negated by trade protectionism and unfair  agricultural subsidies to farmers in countries like the U.S.  Reforming of U.S. trade policy, such as subsidies on commodities  like cotton and rice should go hand in hand with aid programs  that provide developing countries the means to make and market  goods globally.  </p>
