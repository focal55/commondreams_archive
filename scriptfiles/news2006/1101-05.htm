<p>NEW YORK - November 1 - With less than a week to go before the election, it's clear no single issue will have more impact than the war in Iraq. On November 3 at 8:30 pm (check your local listings), NOW goes to one of the most pro-war districts in the country - the Texas 31st - to see how townsfolk deeply affected by our presence in Iraq are expressing their feelings at the ballot box. This solidly-red district is home to Fort Hood, the largest active duty army base in America, and almost everyone living there has a personal connection to the war. Is the war in Iraq changing the minds of even the most entrenched voters? 

<p> "Everybody here has felt the pain of what's going on," Jerry Morris, a district resident and retired Army Major told NOW. "So I think people here are more willing to say, 'maybe we need to rethink what we're doing.'"  

<p>Also, an insightful interview with writer Andrew Sullivan, looking ahead to Tuesday's election. Next time on NOW.

<p>Starting this Friday, the NOW website will feature web-exclusive reports about U.S. congressional candidates from Texas who've made the war a centerpiece of their campaigns, on opposite sides of the issue.
