<p> WASHINGTON - June 15 - The Senate has been hearing testimony about Network neutrality on the 
Internet and is expected to take up the subject in telecommunications 
legislation next week.

<p>MARK COOPER, markcooper@aol.com, http://www.savetheinternet.com
    <br>
Director of research at the Consumer Federation of America, Cooper 
said today: "Network neutrality has existed throughout the history of 
the Internet and created the most dynamic environment for innovation and 
competition the nation has seen in generations. Good government policy 
decisions created an open, neutral communications platform over the 
objections of the telephone companies. It is the opponents of Network 
neutrality who would burden the Internet with Network discrimination. 
... Network discrimination alters the fundamentally open architecture of 
the Internet and forces innovators to negotiate with network operators 
before they can get into business -- ending the era of 'innovation 
without permission,' as Vint Cerf, one of the fathers of the Internet, 
calls it."

<p>JEFF CHESTER, jeff@democraticmedia.org, http://democraticmedia.org<br>
Founder and director of the Center for Digital Democracy, Chester 
wrote the piece "The End of the Internet?" He said today: "Getting rid 
of Network neutrality will make the current open Internet more closely 
resemble the closed world of cable television. Content that will 
dominate will be what is associated with the big phone and cable 
companies. Other content providers will be confined to the Internet 
equivalent of a dirt road. And it's not just PCs but also information 
going to mobile devices and such that will be affected."

<p>SASCHA MEINRATH, sascha@ucimc.org, http://cuwireless.net, 
http://www.saschameinrath.com
  <p>  Meinrath is founder and project coordinator of the Champaign-Urbana 
Wireless Network (CUWiN). He said today: "Telecommunications giants are 
trying to make everyone pay for their poor business planning. They 
overbuilt in many locations during the Internet boom in the late 1990s, 
creating a glut of dark fiber that could be utilized for broadband 
provision. But instead, the telcos are spending billions of dollars 
buying each other in an attempt to prevent the very competition that 
would lower prices and increase service options for consumers.
 <p>   "Network neutrality is needed to maintain an Internet free from 
excessive charges and without content discrimination. These corporations 
are attempting to artificially limit customers' choices so they can 
double-charge Internet users. Today, people and providers already pay 
for broadband access -- these are the fees we pay to get connected to 
the Internet. However, the phone and cable giants are trying to make it 
so that content providers will be forced to pay a second time to prevent 
their content from being discriminated against; in essence, the network 
owners want to charge content providers once for access and a second 
time for speedy delivery."
  <p>  Meinrath added: "CUWiN uses open-source software to provide free 
Internet connectivity to residents of the Champaign-Urbana community and 
many other locations worldwide. We have built clouds of WiFi coverage 
throughout our city -- allowing people free broadband access and the use 
of free services and applications (e.g., telephone/VoIP, streaming audio 
and video, webhosting) via this network. Currently, we get contacted 
every day from organizations and municipalities that would like to learn 
from our successes and are interested in replicating our service 
provision model."
