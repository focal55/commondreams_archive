<p>WASHINGTON - April 5 - Operation Gulf Coast (<a href="http://www.operationgulfcoast.net">http://www.operationgulfcoast.net</a>), a national relief effort of community- and faith-based organizations, labor unions and the Pacifica Radio network, will broadcast a community dialogue from New Orleans on Saturday, April 15, 2006 from 3:00 p.m.– 6:00 p.m., Central Time. Rev. Marjani Dele, pastor of Exodus Ministries, explains, “Our Gulf Coast Mainline dialogues focus on the needs of survivors and their families. Evacuees keep calling for a healing process and self-determination.” Producer Rob Robinson adds, “Voters who were abandoned find it hard to believe mayoral candidates who promise that government, business, and the media will now come to their rescue.” Municipal elections are scheduled for April 22, 2006.  Runoff elections will occur May 20th.
 
<p>Listeners may access this broadcast on the worldwide web at <a href="http://www.pacifica.org">http://www.pacifica.org</a>. The broadcast will also feature a national “800” number enabling survivors throughout the nation to call-in messages to family and friends and raise concerns about the need for information in protecting their rights of return.  Broadcasts are made possible with the support of the Wider Church Ministries of the United Church of Christ.
 
<p>As governments continue sending mixed signals to residents about their property rights, voting rights, and their prospects of returning to their homes, jobs or good health, the mood at the grass roots is volatile. “My property in the Ninth Ward is destroyed: the power and phones and water are still off; I can’t get a trailer. I can’t get straight answers out of my insurance company, the Small Business Administration, or FEMA” says lifelong New Orleans resident, Celine Narcisse. “If the city seizes my property, they’ll never pay me enough to buy a home.  I’d vote for a candidate for Mayor who’ll take a stand for people like me -- if I saw one.”
 
<p>The broadcast will facilitate dialogue among Gulf Coast based advocates such as REACH 2010: At the Heart of New Orleans; Common Ground, ACORN, All Churches Together; activists with New Orleans neighborhood associations; environmental justice groups; labor voices will include the United Teachers of New Orleans and the Communications Workers of America.  
 
<p>The public is cordially invited to participate in this dialogue. It will be held at the Ashe Cultural and Arts Center, 1712 Oretha Castle Haley Boulevard, in New Orleans, Louisiana. Pacifica stations KPFA (FM 94.1) in Berkeley, KPFK (FM 90.7) in Los Angeles, WBAI (FM 99.5), in New York City, KPFT(FM 90.1) in Houston, and WPFW (FM 89.3) in Washington DC will air the broadcast live.  Gulf Coast Mainline is looking for other broadcasters interested in airing our community dialogues.
