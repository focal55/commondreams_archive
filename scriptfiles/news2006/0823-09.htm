<p>WASHINGTON - August 23 - The Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law (&quot;Lawyers'  Committee&quot;) and the Mississippi Center for Justice (&quot;MCJ&quot;) will  hold a free housing workshop on Saturday, August 26 from 2 to 4  p.m. at the Isaiah Fredericks Community Center in North Gulfport.   The workshop is open to the public.
<p>   The goal of this workshop is to provide legal assistance and  support to the over 400 families that live in Charles Warner  Homes in Pascagoula and the L.C. Jones Homes and W.M. Ladnier  Homes in Gulfport. Earlier this month, the Mississippi Regional  Housing Authority (&quot;MRHA&quot;) announced plans to sell or transfer  these public housing complexes. If approved, this plan would  displace hundreds of residents and force them into a rental  market that is already stretched thin. The legal workshop will  provide individual counseling for the residents of these  properties.</p>
<p>   WHO: Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights and Mississippi  Center for Justice</p>
<p>   WHAT: Free Public Housing Workshop - Open to the Public</p>
<p>   WHEN: Saturday, August 26, 2 p.m. - 4 p.m.</p>
<p>   WHERE: Isaiah Fredericks Community Center in North Gulfport</p>
<p>   3312 Martin Luther King Jr. Blvd., Gulfport, MS</p>
<p>   Brief remarks will be made by Barbara Arnwine, Executive  Director of the Lawyers' Committee, Ella Holmes-Hines, City  Council Member, City of Gulfport, and Reilly Morse, Attorney with  the Mississippi Center for Justice.</p>
<p>   In the wake of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, the Lawyers'  Committee and MCJ have coordinated more than 25 community legal  workshops for thousands of hurricane survivors. Through these  workshops, we have directly reached more than 1,000 families in  core disaster areas.</p>
<p>   The Lawyers' Committee is a nonpartisan, nonprofit civil  rights legal organization, formed in 1963 at the request of  President John F. Kennedy to provide legal services to address  racial discrimination.</p>
