<p>WASHINGTON - December 4 - Former CIA director Robert Gates' confirmation hearing is scheduled for 
Tuesday. Several articles on Gates, featuring in-depth information about 
his background and suggested questions, are at: 
<http://www.ConsortiumNews.com><a href="http://www.ConsortiumNews.com">http://www.ConsortiumNews.com</a>.

<p>The following former CIA analysts are available for a limited number of 
interviews:

<p>MELVIN A. GOODMAN, goody789@comcast.net, 
<a href="http://www.commondreams.org/views06/1110-28.htm">http://www.commondreams.org/views06/1110-28.htm</a><p>  Now a senior fellow at the Center for International Policy, Goodman 
was with the CIA for 41 years, serving as a senior analyst and a 
division chief. He wrote a recent piece for the Baltimore Sun titled 
"Wrong Man to Replace Rumsfeld," which stated: "Two previous presidents, 
Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush, nominated Mr. Gates for the 
position of director of central intelligence. In 1987, Mr. Gates had to 
withdraw his name because a majority of Senate Intelligence Committee 
members did not believe his denials regarding prior knowledge of the 
Iran-contra scandal. The independent counsel in the Iran-contra 
investigation, Lawrence E. Walsh, shared their disbelief.
  <p>  "In 1991, Mr. Gates was confirmed after receiving more than 30 
negative votes, far more than any other nominee to the position of CIA 
director had garnered over nearly six decades. Key senators were 
convinced in 1991 that Mr. Gates had a major role in the politicization 
of intelligence on the Soviet Union, Central America and Southwest Asia. 
During his testimony, Mr. Gates, known for his outstanding memory, 
testified 33 times that he did not have any recollection of the facts of 
Iran-contra.
<p> "Mr. Gates became the first career CIA analyst to take over the 
reins of the agency, ultimately doing more harm to the mission and 
mandate of the CIA's intelligence directorate than any previous director 
-- even his mentor, William J. Casey. His strong ideological agenda in 
support of the White House often led him down the wrong analytical road, 
causing him to be wrong about the central issues of the day involving 
the decline and fall of the Soviet Union and the impact of ethnic 
violence on regional conflicts."

<p>RAY McGOVERN, rrmcgovern@aol.com, 
<a href="http://www.miami.com/mld/miamiherald/news/opinion/16158060.htm">http://www.miami.com/mld/miamiherald/news/opinion/16158060.htm</a><p> McGovern was a CIA analyst from 1963 to 1990 and Robert Gates' 
branch chief in the early 1970s. McGovern now serves on the Steering 
Group of Veteran Intelligence Professionals for Sanity. McGovern wrote a 
piece published in today's Miami Herald titled "A CIA Insider's Take on 
Gates," in which he states: "In January 1995, Howard Teicher, who served 
on President Reagan's National Security Council staff, submitted a sworn 
affidavit detailing the activities of Gates and his then-boss, CIA 
Director William Casey, in secretly providing arms to Iraq. This 
violated the Arms Export Control Act in two ways: ignoring the 
requirement to notify Congress; and providing arms to a state designated 
as a sponsor of terrorism.
<p> "It gets worse. To grease the skids for this dubious adventure, 
Gates ordered his more malleable subordinates at the CIA to cook up 
intelligence reports to provide some comfort to Reagan in acquiescing to 
these activities. A National Intelligence Estimate of May 1985 predicted 
Soviet inroads in Iran if the United States did not reach out to 
'moderates' within the Iranian leadership.
<p>"In addition, Gates' analysts were pressed to publish several 
reports beginning in late 1985 -- as HAWK anti-aircraft missiles wended 
their way to Tehran -- that Iranian-sponsored terrorism had 'dropped off 
substantially.' There was no persuasive evidence to support that judgment.
<p>"As part of my official duties at the time, I took steps to make 
Gates aware of this a month before he wrote in articles in the 
Washington Post, Foreign Affairs magazine and our professional journal 
Studies in Intelligence that, 'No CIA publication asserted these 
things.' I then tried in vain to get him to correct the record.
<p>"Since this episode casts serious doubt on Gates' veracity, I felt a 
responsibility to bring it to the attention of the senators weighing 
Gates' nomination to become CIA director in 1991. On Oct. 7, 1991, I 
swore in an affidavit laying out the facts and gave it to the Senate 
Intelligence Committee. I heard nothing."

<p>DAVID MacMICHAEL, dmacm@adelphia.net, 
<a href="http://counterpunch.org/macmichael11142006.html">http://counterpunch.org/macmichael11142006.html</a><p>  MacMichael, a former analyst for the Central Intelligence Agency, is 
also a member of the steering committee of Veteran Intelligence 
Professionals for Sanity. He wrote the piece "The Insider: Gates to the 
Pentagon" on Nov. 14 in which he predicted: "The Democrats, of course, 
will demand, and get, something in return for their acquiescence [on the 
Gates nomination]. Most likely the bone thrown to them will be John 
Bolton, current interim holder of the post of U.S. Ambassador to the 
United Nations." Today, Bolton resigned.
