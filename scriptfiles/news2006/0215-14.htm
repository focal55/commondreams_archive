<p>WASHINGTON - February 15 - Following the release  of new photos and video images depicting severe abuse and torture  of detainees in U.S. government custody, Amnesty International  USA released the following statement from Executive Director  William F. Schulz:</p>
<p>   &quot;The repulsive images released today give a clearer picture of  the scope of abuses perpetrated at Abu Ghraib and raise the  question of what other abuses occurred there and elsewhere when  cameras weren't present.  These releases reaffirm the need for a  truly independent investigation that will look at all levels of  the military chain of command, as well as involvement from other  government agencies like the CIA and private military contractors  who have been implicated in abuses. Despite all the revelations  of abuse, only one senior officer has been reprimanded and no  civilians who devised the torture policies have been held  responsible. Americans expect those who break the law to be held  accountable whether the violators wear uniforms and combat boots  or suits and cowboy boots. Prosecutions of primarily lower-level  military personnel create the impression that those on the front  lines are the scapegoats for policy set at the top.</p>
<p>   The Bush Administration established policies that created an  environment that fostered abuse and even deaths in custody.  Government investigations make it clear that these practices  migrated from Afghanistan to Guantanamo to Iraq and likely secret  detention sites. These images aren't just the antics of a few  soldiers on the night shift. They are the direct result of a  policy engineered by this administration.  Given the  administration's silence on so-called CIA &quot;black-sites&quot; and the  exception President Bush created for himself when he signed the  Anti-Torture Amendment, the administration's torture policy  remains as murky today as when the original photos shocked the  world.</p>
<p>   The only way to cleanse the tarnished reputation of the United  States is to establish an independent commission composed of  credible experts with necessary power to investigate those  involved at all levels of government. The findings of the non- partisan commission should assess accountability and  responsibility of government officials, inform policies to stop  current abuses and send the message that the U.S. government  takes seriously its obligations and respects the rule of law.&quot;</p>
<p>   Amnesty International USA today launched its new web movie,  Connect the Dots - Extraordinary Rendition, a short flash video  designed to raise the public's awareness about the U.S.  government's continued outsourcing of torture.
