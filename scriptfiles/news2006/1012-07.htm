<p>NEW YORK - October 12 - Today Tamara Draut,  director of the Economic Opportunity Program at Demos, a non- partisan public policy and research organization, issued the  following statement regarding the release of a U.S. Government  Accountability Office report analyzing credit card fees, interest  rates and related disclosure provided to consumers. The report,  requested by and released by Sen. Carl Levin, is the first  federal study to compile in a single place a description of the  recent fees, interest rates and disclosure practices of 28  popular credit cards from the six largest credit card issuers.</p>
<p>   &quot;This report confirms what our years of research have shown  us, and what American families are feeling across the country as  they try to make ends meet: Credit card issuers are out of  control and using the fragile economic conditions of America's  households to send profits through the roof.</p>
<p>   &quot;Since the industry has been almost totally deregulated  following two Supreme Court cases -- one in 1979 and the other in  1996, issuers have steadily increased fees and interest rates for  most cardholders, and penalties have skyrocketed for almost all - - well beyond the limits of traditional lending institutions.  During the same time, greater economic vulnerability and risk  have been introduced into the family budget as our nation's  promise of a stable, accessible middle class has become  endangered. For instance:</p>
<p>   -- Credit card debt has more than tripled since 1990 to over  $800 billion in 2005.</p>
<p>   -- Between 2001 and 2005, Americans cashed out nearly $500  billion in home equity to free up needed cash, often to pay-off  high-cost credit, but depleting a families most essential asset</p>
<p>   -- A recent survey of low- and moderate-income Americans with  credit card debt by Demos and the Center for Responsible Lending  found that basic necessities like car repairs, home repairs, and  medical expenses contributed to credit card debt.</p>
<p>   -- Nearly half (46 percent) of all households had credit card  debt in 2004.</p>
<p>   &quot;Moreover, credit card companies reaped the benefits of steep  declines in the Federal reserve rate in the 90's, but  deliberately didn't pass the savings on to their customers -- and  instead raised penalty rates and fees dramatically. It's time to  reverse this trend.</p>
<p>   &quot;One thing we could do is ask Congress to take serious action  to protect consumers from deceptive credit card terms and  exorbitant interest rates and fees by passing a Borrower's  Security Act that would restore the balance of power in the  lending relationship. A Borrower's Security Act should:</p>
<p>   -- Prohibit credit card companies from raising a cardholder's  interest rate based solely on payments to other creditors.</p>
<p>   -- Provide a late-payment grace period of at least five days  before fees or interest rate hikes can be assessed.</p>
<p>   -- Limit rate increases to 10 percent above the cardholder's  original rate and to new transactions only.</p>
<p>   -- Require disclosure of the full costs of only making minimum  payments and raise the minimum payment requirement to 5 percent  of the total balance for new cardholders.</p>
<p>   -- Require credit cards issued to individuals under age 21 to  have a co-signer, unless they can prove they have independent  means of support.</p>
<p>   &quot;It's time to give America's families, rather than credit card  issuers, a break for a change.&quot;</p>
