<p>WASHINGTON - November 1 - The war in Iraq, and U.S. foreign policy generally, are the top issues with voters in the upcoming election. Peace organizations around the country are engaging in a number of electoral and voter education strategies to help keep the electorate’s focus there.

 

<p>As part of the Peace Action’s Peace Voter 2006 campaign [ http://www.peace-action.org/2006/ ], the following efforts are being organized around the country:

 
<ul>
<li>In Massachusetts, public referendums on the Iraq war are on the ballot in 139 towns. Wisconsin has a similar referendum on the ballot in 42 municipalities, including Milwaukee, the state’s largest city. <br>
<br>
<li>Candidate forums highlighting peace and justice issues have been organized in competitive races in Maine, Maryland, New York and Wisconsin. Candidate briefings have been organized in numerous other states and districts. <br>
<br>
<li>Organizers have been hired to work for campaigns in Ohio, Connecticut, Virginia, New Mexico and California. Door canvasses have been set up in competitive races in southeastern Pennsylvania. <br>
<br>
<li>Peace Voter Guides have been produced in 18 races, and are being distributed to millions of voters through door hanger campaigns and mailings, as well as being promoted online and published in newspaper ads. [ <a href="http://www.peace-action.org/2006/voterguides.html">http://www.peace-action.org/2006/voterguides.html</a> ] <br>
<br>
<li>Over 134,000 signatures have been gathered on the Peace Voter Pledge, where voters can pledge to vote only for candidates who will end the war in Iraq and oppose future wars of aggression. [ <a href="http://www.peace-action.org/2006/peacevoterpledge.html">http://www.peace-action.org/2006/peacevoterpledge.html</a> ] <br>
<br>
<li>Nearly $100,000 donated directly to peace candidates or for independent expenditures; 55 candidate endorsements 
 </ul>

<p>“Polls show a consensus between the Iraqi and American people, namely the war must end,” said Kevin Martin, Executive Director of Peace Action.  “Sadly, the politicians in Washington have been way behind the people, and next Tuesday’s election offers an opportunity to correct that. Americans want to end the war and change course on US foreign policy, from ‘pre-emptive war’ and threats to international cooperation, diplomacy and human rights.”
