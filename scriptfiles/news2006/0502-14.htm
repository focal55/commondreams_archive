<p>RALEIGH, North Carolina - May 2 - Certain members of Congress keep trying to convince the American people that if we had opened the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil drilling 10 years ago, we wouldn’t be facing the high gas prices we face today. The Bush administration’s own facts tell us differently.

<p>Oil from the Arctic Refuge would not even begin to affect the price of a gallon of gasoline for 20 years from the time the refuge is first drilled, and even then it would only lower gas prices by about a penny per gallon.

<p>Now consider that with technology that exists today we could produce all new vehicles that get 40 miles per gallon within 10 years. This kind of mileage in the near future would save the average driver $2,200 over the lifetime of their vehicle.

<p>One penny in twenty years and the loss of even more American wilderness, or $2,200 in ten years and an untouched refuge for polar bears, caribou and countless other creatures.

<p>You do the math.
