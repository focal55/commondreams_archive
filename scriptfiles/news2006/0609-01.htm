<p>WASHINGTON - June 9 - Samuel Thoron, national  president of Parents, Families and Friends of Lesbians and Gays  (PFLAG) closed out the week of debate on the Federal Marriage  Amendment by sending a letter to President George W. Bush  criticizing his support for the discriminatory legislation and  reminding him of his obligations to all Americans. Following is  the full text of the letter:</p>
<p>   June 8, 2006</p>
<p>   Dear President Bush,</p>
<p>   It is my honor to serve Parents, Families and Friends of  Lesbians and Gays (PFLAG) as national president. We are the  nation's largest family organization dedicated to equality for  gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender citizens. PFLAG proudly  sponsors over 500 grassroots chapters and affiliates with  locations in each of the 50 states and the District of Columbia.  I write on behalf of our members, over 200,000 parents, family  members and supporters, in expressing our outrage over your  recent, very public, statements in support of the Federal  Marriage Amendment.</p>
<p>   You are using the full prestige and weight of your office to  advocate for an amendment to the United States Constitution that,  for the first time since the abolition of slavery, seeks for all  time to perpetuate discrimination against a class of citizens. We  fail to understand why perpetuating the oppression of our family  members should be a national priority.</p>
<p>   In the very same speech, you state that &quot;every American  deserves to be treated with tolerance and respect and dignity.&quot;  How you can say this when you lobby for a change of our  Constitution that permanently consigns our lesbian, gay, bisexual  and transgender children, family members and loved ones to second  class citizenship is utterly beyond comprehension.</p>
<p>   You argue that this decision belongs with the people. In the  long history of our country, ending discrimination against an  oppressed minority has rarely begun as the will of the majority.  Because the majority of the people desire a certain action does  not make that action right or just. Placing this issue before the  people may simply be subjecting yet one more oppressed minority  to the tyranny of the majority. </p>
<p>   I deeply believe that, like every other citizen of this great  country, my daughter deserves to be treated in every aspect of  her life with the same respect and dignity as flows so naturally  to her two brothers and to your two daughters. As Parents,  Families and Friends of Lesbians and Gays, all we want for our  children, families and loved ones is that they have full access  to all the rights, privileges and obligations of full  participation in citizenship, including the rights and  obligations that come with civil marriage, the right to build a  family. In the name of &quot;family values,&quot; it is these very rights  that you would have them denied by our Constitution.</p>
<p>   Mr. President, I remind you that you have an obligation to  govern on behalf of every citizen of this country, not just the  slim majority who elected you, nor on behalf of the vocal  minority who would have you advance their discriminatory and  sectarian special agenda. This country was founded on the concept  of liberty and justice for all. For the President of the United  States to advocate and lobby for discrimination against and  oppression of any group of citizens is an inappropriate and,  frankly, cowardly use of the power of the office and is  inexcusable, not to say, unforgivable.</p>
<p>   Very truly yours,</p>
<p>   Samuel Thoron</p>
<p>   National President</p>
<p>   Parents, Families and Friends of Lesbians and Gays</p>
<p>   ---</p>
<p>   EDITOR'S NOTE: Samuel Thoron and other PFLAG leaders are  available for comment on the Federal Marriage Amendment and other  issues. Please contact Jean-Marie Navetta to arrange an  interview.</p>
