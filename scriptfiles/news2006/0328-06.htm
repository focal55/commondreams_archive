<p>BEIJING - March 28 - China is central to the laundering of illegal 
timber from some of the world's most endangered forests, according to a 
new investigative report by Greenpeace. The trade is driven by domestic 
and international demand in the USA, Europe, Japan and other developed 
countries.

<p>'Sharing the Blame: Global Consumption and China's Role in Ancient 
Forest Destruction' (1), documents illegally logged timber, particularly 
from the Paradise Forests of Asia Pacific (2), being shipped to China. 
There, it is made into furniture, flooring and plywood for domestic 
consumption and for export to satisfy the rising, global demand for 
inexpensive wood products.

<p>China is now the world's largest importer of tropical woods: half of all 
tropical trees logged globally end up in China. Much of this wood comes 
from Indonesia and Papua New Guinea where between 76 to 90 per cent of 
the logging is illegal.

<p>"Illegal logging is rampant in many of the countries that supply China 
with wood and this destructive trade is fueling the global forest 
crisis," said Sze Pang Cheung, deputy campaign director for Greenpeace 
China. "China has committed internationally to tackle this problem and 
must, together with all countries that import these wood products, take 
urgent concrete action to ban the trade in timber from illegal or 
destructive logging."

<p>The report applauds some international buyers for starting to address 
the issue of illegal logging.  Recently, numerous companies in Europe 
have committed to stop purchasing Chinese plywood made from illegally 
logged timber from Papua New Guinea. These include Wolseley (UK), 
PontMeyer (Netherlands), Castorama (France) and the French Federation of 
Timber Importers (Le Commerce du Bois).

<p>However, the report concludes that the world's forests cannot sustain 
current consumption patterns in developed countries and China's 
escalating demand. China's hunger for wood is already driving more trees 
to be felled.

<p>In the last 10 years alone, China's total consumption of wood products 
increased by 70%. A third of this was due to increase in exports of wood 
products and 66% to increases in domestic consumption. Greenpeace warns 
that if China were to increase its per capita paper consumption to that 
of the USA, for example, this would require nearly 1.6 billion 
additional cubic metres of wood to be logged - equivalent to the Earth's 
entire yearly harvest.

<p>Today, it is North America, Europe, Japan and other developed countries 
that consume more ancient forests than anyone else.
 
<p>"There's massive over-consumption of wood products in developed regions 
such as North America and Europe," said Tamara Stark, international 
advisor to Greenpeace China. "If the world's ancient forests are to 
survive, consumption levels in these countries has to drop dramatically."

<p>This month, China acknowledged that the environmental impact of 
consumption is a serious issue, with Premier, Wen Jiabao's, call to the 
country to reduce consumption of wood. Just last week, the Chinese 
Government announced a 5% consumption tax on hardwood flooring and 
disposable chopsticks.

<p>"It's positive that China is taking steps to address wasteful 
consumption of wood products, but the scale pf the problem warrants 
nothing less than a new vision of development," said Sze Pang Cheung.

<p>Greenpeace is urging China and the other 187 signatory nations to the 
United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), meeting in 
Curitiba, Brazil this week, to protect the world's last ancient forests 
up by establishing a global network of protected forest areas, to ban 
the trade in illegally and destructively logged wood products and to 
introduce a legally binding mechanism under the CBD to combat illegal 
and destructive logging.

<p>Greenpeace is an independent, campaigning organisation which uses 
non-violent, creative confrontation to expose global environmental 
problems, and to force solutions essential to a green and peaceful 
future. It is committed to protecting the world's last ancient forests 
and the people and animals that depend upon them.

<p>Images of the Paradise Forest and video footage of the trade in 
illegally and destructively logged timber are available on request.
