<p>WASHINGTON - March 9 - Americans United for  Separation of Church and State today blasted the Bush  administration for its relentless effort to steer federal funds  to religious organizations, charging that the &quot;faith-based&quot;  initiative undermines civil rights and civil liberties.</p>
<p>   President George W. Bush renewed his push for the initiative  today in a speech in Washington, D.C. A new administration report  claims that $2.15 billion in tax aid was directed to faith-based  groups for social services during the last fiscal year. </p>
<p>   James Towey, head of the White House Office of Faith-Based and  Community Initiatives, asserts that Bush is breaking down  barriers that prevented religious groups from accessing  government funds.</p>
<p>   &quot;The president seems to have little or no regard for the  separation of church and state,&quot; said the Rev. Barry W. Lynn,  Americans United executive director.  &quot;This initiative clearly  rolls back constitutional safeguards and civil rights protections  that people count on.&quot;</p>
<p>   &quot;Bush is slashing social service spending across the board and  using the faith-based initiative to divert attention from the  cuts,&quot; said Lynn. &quot;This initiative is a scam, and I hope  America's religious leaders and the American people don't fall  for it.&quot;</p>
<p>   Lynn added, &quot;Bush persists in claiming that religious  charities have a better success rate than governmental and  private secular programs. However, there is no proof that this  assertion is true.&quot;</p>
<p>   &quot;It is particularly deplorable that Bush boasts about rolling  back civil rights protections for government employment,&quot; Lynn  continued. &quot;This initiative lets religious groups run publicly  funded programs that openly discriminate in hiring on religious  grounds. That's an outrage.&quot;</p>
<p>   Under executive orders issued by the president, tax dollars  can go to religious groups to operate social services even if  they discriminate in hiring on religious grounds. Thus, taxpayers  are being required to pay for programs where they would not be  allowed to work or even volunteer.</p>
<p>   Lynn charged that far from trying to create a level playing  field for faith-based groups, Bush wants to tilt the process  toward favored religious groups and leaders.</p>
<p>   &quot;I don't think it's coincidental that TV preacher Pat  Robertson, a prominent Bush backer, received $1.5 million in  faith-based funding,&quot; said Lynn. </p>
<p>   The initiative, Lynn said, has clearly been used for partisan  purposes. He noted that in February, Towey spoke at a conference  on the initiative for religious leaders in Pennsylvania, where  U.S. Sen. Rick Santorum, who is locked in a tight re-election  bid, appeared via video.</p>
