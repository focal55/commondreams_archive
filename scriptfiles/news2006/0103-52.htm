<p>WASHINGTON - January 3 - Tomorrow U.S. Senator Russ Feingold will again 
          introduce legislation to establish a timetable to redeploy U.S. troops 
          from Iraq. The legislation builds on Feingold&#8217;s effort in the 
          last Congress to end the military mission in Iraq in order to focus 
          attention and resources on our top national security priority: defeating 
          global terrorist networks. Feingold&#8217;s legislation would require 
          the administration to submit a timetable for the redeployment of U.S. 
          forces from Iraq within six months. The bill would allow a minimal number 
          of U.S. forces to remain in Iraq for targeted counter-terrorism activities, 
          training of Iraqi security forces, and the protection of U.S. infrastructure 
          and personnel.
<p>&#8220;The American people sent a strong message in November to fix 
            the administration&#8217;s failed Iraq policy, the same message I 
            have heard from Wisconsinites at my listening sessions,&#8221; Feingold 
            said. &#8220;So far, the administration has ignored that message and 
            is considering sending more troops to Iraq &#8211; something that 
            would run counter to our national security and the wishes of the American 
            people. Congress can&#8217;t afford to make the same mistake. We must 
            redeploy our troops from Iraq so that we can focus on serious threats 
            to our security &#8211; in Somalia, Afghanistan and elsewhere &#8211; 
            that have only grown while this Administration has been distracted 
            in Iraq.&#8221;</p>
          <p>In August 2005, Feingold became the first U.S. Senator to propose 
            a target date for the redeployment of U.S. troops from Iraq. In June 
            2006, Feingold cosponsored an amendment to the FY2007 Department of 
            Defense authorization bill that would have required the redeployment 
            of U.S. troops from Iraq by July 1, 2007. In the 109th Congress, Feingold 
            also introduced several bills addressing counter-terrorism and national 
            security priorities, including provisions for strengthening our efforts 
            in Afghanistan and Somalia.</p>
          <p>&quot;The way to win a war against global terrorist networks is not 
            by keeping over 140,000 brave American troops in Iraq indefinitely,&quot; 
            Feingold said. &quot;The President's failed, Iraq-centric policies 
            are preventing us from effectively countering serious threats around 
            the world. We must change course, and the 110th Congress can start 
          now by passing this bill to redeploy our troops from Iraq.&quot;</p>
