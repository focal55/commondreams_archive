<p>WASHINGTON - July 17 -
<p><b>On Africa:</b>

<p>“We welcome the fact that UK and French pressure has led the G8 to agree a review of progress on Africa when they meet again in Germany in 2007. However, it is less clear how much progress we can expect on the back of today’s announcements. The G8 has ignored the fact they’re off track on aid, and stalling on education and HIV and AIDS.”
Moussa Faye, ActionAid Senegal director

<p><b>On the fight against infectious diseases:  </b>

<p>“Despite a lack of support from Germany and Japan, it’s positive news that other G8 members are taking forward the Advanced Market Commitments initiative, creating incentives for the development of life-saving drugs.

<p>“However, the G8 has fallen short on HIV and AIDS, by repeating existing promises and - with the exception of Russia - not pledging money to bridge a $10 billion financing gap. Having made political capital last year by pledging universal access to treatment, the G8 is now slipping on implementation.”
Patrick Watt, ActionAid UK policy coordinator

<p><b>On education:</b>

<p>“Four years on from the establishment of the Education Fast Track Initiative to get the world’s poorest children into school, the G8 has failed the test by simply recycling last year’s language. 

<p>"A Fast Track financing gap of over $400m is preventing some of the poorest countries from implementing carefully prepared plans, while 100 million children remain out of school. This summit has done next to nothing to address this crisis.”
Patrick Watt, ActionAid UK policy coordinator
