<p>WASHINGTON  - November 13 - Feminists continue to celebrate the results of the 2006 midterm 
            elections and recognize the hard work and resolve that brought many 
            new women's rights supporters to Congress. As much as we enjoy -- 
            and quite frankly deserve -- a good celebration, it's not too soon 
            to ask: What next? 

<P>Come January, both the House and the Senate will be under new 
            leadership, and women and men across the United States will be 
            watching. Will the 110th Congress seize upon this fresh chance to 
            live up to our nation's ideals? Will this victory be merely a 
            cosmetic one, or can we expect real change and progress? </P>
            <P>The initial legislative plans from the new leaders, Rep. Nancy 
            Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Sen. Harry Reid (D-Nev.) bode well for women, 
            if they are not blocked by Bush allies still stung by the voters' 
            repudiation of their agenda. </P>
            <P>One of Pelosi's first commitments is to put new rules in place to 
            "break the link between lobbyists and legislation," which will 
            increase the likelihood of legislators making decisions based on the 
            best interests of the people, rather than the interests of the 
            lobbyists -- and will make it easier for advocates to promote 
            positive change that increases fairness and equality.</P>
            <P>Increasing the minimum wage to $7.25 an hour will have a dramatic 
            impact on the quality of life for women and their families. Women 
            are the majority of those working at minimum wage, and many are 
            working two and three jobs to make ends meet. We deserve to be paid 
            fairly for the work that we do, and we hope the Paycheck Fairness 
            Act and the Fair Pay Act will also be on the agenda as the 110th 
            Congress progresses.</P>
            <P>There's also a strong commitment by the new leadership to protect 
            Social Security from privatization and allow the government to 
            negotiate directly with the pharmaceutical companies for lower drug 
            prices for Medicare patients -- both of those commitments are 
            critical to women because we are the most likely to be among the 
            elderly poor and dependent on Social Security in our later 
years.</P>
            <P>And of course, there is a determination to change the course in 
            Iraq, and we will work with the new leadership to ensure that the 
            safety and rights of women are increased, not decreased, by U.S. 
            actions in the future.</P>
            <P>MORE ON THE AGENDA:</P>
            <P>After 12 years of inaction, the agenda for women's rights is 
            broad and long, but we hope to see action on many other important 
            issues in the coming years, from family/work balance and women's 
            health concerns, to stem cell research and hate crimes.</P>
            <P>The targeting of girls in recent school shootings reminds us that 
            it's past time for Congress to finally add gender, disability and 
            sexual orientation to the existing hate crimes law. As we saw in the 
            Colorado and Amish school shootings, women and girls are sometimes 
            singled out for cruelty and even murder because of their gender, yet 
            federal law does not consider these acts to be hate crimes, as it 
            would if the students had been targeted because of their race or 
            religion.</P>
            <P>Another important priority is The Balancing Act, introduced this 
            session by Rep. Lynn Woolsey (D-Calif.), which would help women and 
            men balance work and family by providing greater access to family 
            and medical leave, expanding child care options, increasing funding 
            for after-school programs and encouraging family-friendly 
            workplaces.</P>
            <P>Women's reproductive rights and health have been under relentless 
            attack from the Bush administration and its cronies in Congress, and 
            the new leadership has already committed to broadening the types of 
            stem cell research allowed with federal funds. We also look for 
            action on Plan B emergency contraception (EC), and Rep. Carolyn 
            Maloney (D-N.Y.) has pledged to pursue broader availability of EC to 
            the women who need it most. Rep. Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.) has 
            introduced the FDA Scientific Fairness Act for Women, which would 
            halt the Food and Drug Administration's approval process on silicone 
            breast implants until the agency can actually establish the life of 
            silicone breast implants and until implant makers can prove the 
            safety of the product</P>
            <P>These forward-thinking policies are only the beginning. We are 
            energized and we will not stop, because women's and girls' 
            opportunities, health, well-being and futures are on the line.</P>
            <P>In addition to voting for representatives who are committed to 
            our issues, the best way to ensure that women's rights are protected 
            and advanced at the federal level is for constituents to expect and 
            demand it. We will be off to a good start with the 110th 
Congress.</P><!-- #EndEditable -->
