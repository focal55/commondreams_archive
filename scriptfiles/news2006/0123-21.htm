<p>WASHINGTON - January 23 - The still-unfolding congressional scandal surrounding lobbyist Jack Abramoff has prompted Democrats and Republicans to unveil a number of reform proposals aimed at curbing the pay-to-play culture that is flourishing in Washington.</p>

<p>But since Congress has proven over and over in the last decade - most notably in the last year - that it cannot police itself like it is supposed to, Common Cause believes any new reforms will be ignored without strong and credible enforcement of the rules.&#160; For that reason, Congress must create an independent ethics commission, insulated from partisan manipulation, to investigate complaints and recommend sanctions.</p>

<p>Common Cause convened a panel of experts on legislative ethics at the federal and state levels Monday to discuss how such a panel might work.&#160; More than 30 states have ethics commissions with varying degrees of independence and with jurisdiction over state legislatures.</p>

<p>"This is an idea whose time has come," said Common Cause President Chellie Pingree.&#160; "New rules and new prohibitions around lobbying and ethics won't mean anything without credible enforcement.&#160; A number of states have already created independent ethics commissions because of the inherent problems of peer review for elected officials.&#160; Washington should follow their lead."</p>

<p>The panel, entitled <strong>Restoring Ethics in Washington: How Congress Can Create an Independent Ethics Commission</strong>, included the following:</p>

<p><strong>Norman Ornstein</strong>, resident scholar and congressional expert at the American Enterprise Institute</p>

<p><strong>Stanley Brand</strong>, founding partner, Brand Law Group; former general counsel to the U.S. House of Representatives</p>

<p><strong>Dennis Thompson</strong>, Alfred North Whitehead Professor of Political Philosophy at Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government; founding director of the Edmond J. Safra Foundation Center for Ethics</p>

<p><strong>Bonnie J. Williams</strong>, executive director, State of Florida Commission on Ethics</p>

<p><strong>The Hon. Anthony M. Wilhoit</strong>, executive director, Kentucky Legislative Ethics Commission</p>

<p><strong>Chellie Pingree</strong>, president of Common Cause</p>
