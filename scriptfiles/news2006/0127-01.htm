  White House Erodes Open Government</A> </strong></p>

  <p style='text-align:justify;font-family:Arial;font-size:10.0pt'> While the White House has expanded its ability to keep tabs on civilians, it's been   working to curtail the ability of the public&mdash;and even Congress&mdash;to find out what the   government is doing. One year ago, Rep. Henry A. Waxman, D-Calif., released an 81-page analysis of   how the administration has administered the country's major open government   laws. The report found that <strong>the feds consistently "narrowed the scope and   application" of the Freedom of Information Act, the Presidential Records Act and   other key public-information legislation, while expanding laws blocking access   to certain records&mdash;even creating new categories of "protected" information and   exempting entire departments from public scrutiny.</strong> When those methods haven't been enough, the  administration has simply   refused to release records&mdash;even when requested by a congressional   subcommittee or the Government Accountability Office.   
  Given the news media's  interest in safeguarding open government   laws, one wonders why these findings weren't publicized    far and wide.</p>

  <p style='text-align:justify;font-family:Arial;font-size:10.0pt'>The civilized world may well look back on the   assaults on Fallujah in 2004 as examples of utter disregard for the most basic wartime   rules of engagement. U.N.   High Commissioner for Human Rights Louise Arbour called for an investigation   into whether the Americans and their allies had engaged in "the deliberate   targeting of civilians, indiscriminate and disproportionate attacks, the killing   of injured persons, and the use of human shields," among other possible "grave   breaches of the Geneva Conventions&quot; considered war crimes under federal law.     
  More than 83 percent of Fallujah's 300,000 residents fled the city. Men between the ages of   15 and 45 were refused safe passage, and all who remained&mdash;about 50,000&mdash;were   treated as enemy combatants.   
  <strong>Numerous sources reported that coalition forces cut off water and   electricity, shot at anyone who ventured out into the   open, executed families waving white flags while trying to swim across the   Euphrates, shot at ambulances, and allowed corpses to rot in the streets and be eaten by dogs. </strong>Medical staff reported seeing people with melted   faces and limbs, injuries consistent with the use of phosphorous bombs. But you likely  know  little of this as the media hardly mentioned it.  </p>

  <p style='text-align:justify;font-family:Arial;font-size:10.0pt'> The mainstream media  largely   ignored  evidence that electronic voting machines were <a href="http://www.wanttoknow.info/electronicvoting">susceptible to   tampering</a> and downplayed  <a href="http://www.wanttoknow.info/votingproblems">political alliances</a> between the machines' manufacturers   and the Bush administration. Then came Nov. 2, 2004. President Bush prevailed by 3 million votes&mdash;despite exit polls that  projected   John Kerry winning by a margin of 5 million. "Exit polls are highly accurate," wrote Professor Steve Freeman of the University   of Pennsylvania's Center for Organizational Dynamics in an article co-authored with statistician Josh Mitteldorf of Temple University. "They remove most   of the sources of potential polling error by identifying actual voters and   asking them immediately afterward who they had voted for." <strong>The  discrepancy of <strong>8 million votes</strong> was well beyond the poll's recognized   margin of error<strong> of less than one percent</strong>.  The official result deviated  by more than five percent, which is considered a statistical impossibility. </strong>Freeman and Mitteldorf analyzed   the data and found   that "only in precincts that used old-fashioned, hand-counted paper ballots did   the official count and the exit polls fall within the normal sampling margin of   error." The discrepancy between the exit polls and the official   count was considerably greater in the critical swing states.</p>

  <p style='text-align:justify;font-family:Arial;font-size:10.0pt'>It's a well-known dirty trick   in the halls of government: If you want to pass unpopular legislation that you   know won't stand up to scrutiny, just wait until the public isn't looking.   That's precisely what the White House did Dec. 13, 2003, the day   American troops captured Saddam Hussein. President Bush celebrated the occasion by privately signing into law the Intelligence   Authorization Act&mdash;a controversial expansion of the PATRIOT Act that included   items culled from the "Domestic Security Enhancement Act of 2003," a draft   proposal that had been shelved due to a public outcry after being leaked. <strong>Specifically, the IAA allows the government to obtain an individual's   financial records without a court order. The law also makes it illegal for   institutions to inform anyone that the government has requested those records,   or that information has been shared with the authorities.</strong> The law also broadens the definition of &quot;financial institution&quot; to include   insurance companies, travel and real estate agencies, stockbrokers, the U.S.   Postal Service, jewelry stores, casinos, airlines, car dealerships, and any   other business &quot;whose cash transactions have a high degree of usefulness in   criminal, tax or regulatory matters.&quot; In one fell swoop, this act has decimated our rights to privacy, due   process, and freedom of speech.</p>

  <p style='text-align:justify;font-family:Arial;font-size:10.0pt'>The   American people reacted to the tsunami that hit the Indian Ocean last December   with an outpouring of compassion and private donations. Across the nation,   neighbors got together to collect food, clothing, medicine and financial   contributions.  The White House initially offered an embarrassingly low $15 million in aid.   More importantly, the government exploited the   catastrophe to its own strategic advantage. Establishing a stronger military presence in the area could help the United   States keep closer tabs on China. It could also fortify an important military launching ground and help   consolidate control over potentially lucrative trade routes. The United States   currently operates a base out of Diego Garcia&mdash;a former British mandate about halfway between Africa and Indonesia, but the lease   runs out in 2016. Consequently, <strong>in the name of relief, the U.S. revived the Utapao military   base in Thailand it had used during the Vietnam War and reactivated its   military cooperation agreements with Thailand and the Visiting Forces Agreement   with the Philippines.</strong></p>

  <p style='text-align:justify;font-family:Arial;font-size:10.0pt'>The United Nations  allegedly allowed Saddam   Hussein to rake in $10 billion in illegal cash through the Oil for Food program. <em>New York Times</em> columnist William Safire   referred to the alleged U.N. con game as "the richest rip-off in world history." According to the GAO, Hussein smuggled $6 billion worth of oil out of   Iraq&mdash;most of it through the Persian Gulf.  <strong>Yet most of the oil that left Iraq by land did so through Jordan and Turkey&mdash;with   the approval of the United States.</strong> The first Bush administration informally   exempted Jordan from the ban on purchasing Iraqi oil&mdash;an arrangement that   provided Hussein with $4.4 billion over 10 years, according to the CIA's own   findings. The U.S. later allowed Iraq to leak another $710 million   worth of oil through Turkey, all while U.S. planes enforcing no-fly zones flew   overhead. Scott Ritter, a U.N. weapons inspector in Iraq during the first six years of   economic sanctions against the country, unearthed yet another scam: The United   States allegedly allowed an oil company run by Russian foreign minister Yevgeny   Primakov's sister to purchase cheap oil from Iraq and resell it to U.S.   companies at market value&mdash;purportedly earning Hussein "hundreds of millions"   more.</p>

  <p style='text-align:justify;font-family:Arial;font-size:10.0pt'>Last   year was the deadliest year for reporters since the International Federation of   Journalists began keeping tabs in 1984. A total of 129 media workers lost their   lives, and 49 of them&mdash;more than a third&mdash;were killed in Iraq.  As far as anyone has yet proved, no commanding officer ever ordered a   subordinate to fire on journalists. But what <em>can</em> be shown is a pattern of tacit   complicity, side by side with a heavy-handed campaign to curb journalists' right   to roam freely.<strong> The Pentagon has refused to implement basic safeguards to protect journalists   who aren't embedded with coalition forces, despite repeated requests by Reuters   and media-advocacy organizations. </strong>To date, U.S. authorities have not disciplined a single officer or soldier   involved in the killing of a journalist. Meanwhile, the interim government the United States installed in Iraq raided   and closed down Al-Jazeera's Baghdad offices almost as soon as it took power and   banned the network from doing any reporting in the country. In November, the interim government ordered news organizations to "stick to the government line on the U.S.-led offensive in Fallujah or face legal action," in an official command sent out on interim prime minister Eyad Allawi's letterhead.</p>

  <p style='text-align:justify;font-family:Arial;font-size:10.0pt'>Historians believe it   was in the "fertile crescent" where Iraq now lies, that humans   first learned to farm. "It is here...that mankind   first domesticated wheat," wrote Jeremy Smith in   the <em>Ecologist</em>. "The U.S., however, has decided that Iraqis   don't know what wheat works best in their own conditions." Smith was referring to Order 81, penned by Paul Bremer, the U.S. administrator in Iraq, and left as a legacy by the American   government when it transferred operations to interim Iraqi authorities. <strong>The   regulation sets criteria for the patenting of seeds that can only be met by   multinational companies like Monsanto or Syngenta, and it grants the patent   holder exclusive rights over every aspect of all plant products yielded by those   seeds.</strong> The new scheme   effectively launches a process whereby Iraqi farmers will soon have to purchase   their seeds rather than using seeds saved from their own crops or bought at the   local market. Native varieties will be replaced by foreign&mdash;and genetically   engineered&mdash;seeds.   Order 81 fit nicely into the outlines   of a U.S. "Economy Plan," a 101-page blueprint for the economic makeover of   Iraq, formulated with ample help from corporate lobbyists. BBC journalist Greg Palast reported that   someone inside the State Department leaked the plan to him a month prior to the   invasion. Smith put it simply: "The people whose forefathers first mastered the   domestication of wheat will now have to pay for the privilege of growing it for   someone else. And with that, the world's oldest farming heritage will become   just another subsidiary link in the vast American supply chain."  </p>

  <p style='text-align:justify;font-family:Arial;font-size:10.0pt'>The Bush   administration has been paying a lot more attention to Iran recently. Part of   that interest is clearly Iran's nuclear program&mdash;but there may be more to the   story. One bit of news that hasn't received the public attention it merits is   Iran's declared intent to open an international oil exchange market, or   "bourse." Not only would the new entity compete against the New York Mercantile   Exchange and London's International Petroleum Exchange (both owned by American   corporations), but it would also ignite international oil trading in euros. <strong>A shift away from U.S. dollars to euros in the oil market would cause the   demand for petrodollars to drop, perhaps causing the value of the dollar to   plummet<em>. </em></strong>Russia, Venezuela and some members of OPEC have expressed interest in moving   towards a petroeuro system. And it isn't entirely implausible that   China, which is the world's second largest holder of U.S. currency reserves,   might eventually follow suit. Barring a U.S. attack, it appears imminent that Iran's euro-dominated oil   bourse will open in March 2006. Logically, the   most appropriate U.S. strategy is compromise with the EU and OPEC towards a   dual-currency system for international oil trades. But you won't hear any discussion of that alternative on the 6 o'clock news. </p>

  <p style='text-align:justify;font-family:Arial;font-size:10.0pt'>On Aug. 15,   environmental activists created a human blockade by locking themselves to   drilling equipment, obstructing the National Coal Corp.'s access to a strip mine   in the Appalachian Mountains 40 miles north of Knoxville, Tenn. It was just the   latest in a protracted campaign that environmentalists say has national   implications, but that's been ignored by the media outside the immediate area. <strong>Under contention is a technique wherein entire mountaintops are removed  to access the coal underneath&mdash;a practice that is nothing short of   devastating for the local ecosystem, but which could become much more   widespread.</strong> As it stands, 93 new coal plants are in the works nationwide. Areas incredibly rich in biodiversity are being   turned into the biological equivalent of parking lots. Is this  the final solution for 200-million-year-old mountains?</p>
