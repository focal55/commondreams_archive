<p>WASHINGTON - August 18 - Next month, people across the country will participate in 
a nationwide 'Walk for Peace' to raise awareness of legislation (HR 3760 and 
S. 1756) currently in the House and Senate to create a cabinet-level U.S. 
Department of Peace and Nonviolence.  The walk is sponsored by The Peace 
Alliance, a nonprofit, non-partisan citizen action organization spearheading 
the national campaign for a US Department of Peace.  Proponents of the 
legislation hope to build on rapidly growing grassroots support to persuade 
lawmakers that now is the time to create a U.S. Department of Peace.

<p>"We want our elected representatives to understand how important the 
Department of Peace legislation is to their constituents and the world," says 
Peace Alliance Executive Director Dot Maver.  We want to help them 
understand that their constituents will actively work to 'elect peace' - that 
they'll support with enthusiasm local, state and national politicians who 
endorse the Department of Peace and measures to counter the trends of 
increasing violence we're seeing at home and abroad."

<p>Internationally, the Department of Peace and Nonviolence will advise the 
President and Congress on the most sophisticated techniques and innovative 
ideas regarding peace-creation among nations.  It would also research and 
analyze the root causes of war and other forms of violence to help prevent 
conflicts from escalating out of control in the first place.  A Peace Academy, 
on par with the Military Service Academies, would train civilian peacekeepers 
and the military in the latest nonviolent conflict resolution strategies and 
approaches. 

<p>Domestically, the Department will develop policies and allocate re sources to 
effectively reduce the levels of domestic and gang violence, child abuse and 
various other forms of societal discord.   Statistics reveal that each year, 
medical expenses from domestic violence alone total at least $3 to $5 billion, 
and businesses forfeit another $100 million in lost wages, sick leave, 
absenteeism and non-productivity.  

<p>'Walk for Peace' is scheduled for September 16th and is a prelude to 
International Peace Day, September 21st, when peace groups from around 
the world, including The Peace Alliance, will call for a global cease-fire.  Walks 
are organized in 32 states and the countries of Pakistan and Nigeria.

Peace Alliance website at: www.thepeacealliance.org.
