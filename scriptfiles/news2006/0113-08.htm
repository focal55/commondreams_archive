<p>WASHINGTON - January 13 - Maryland state legislators voted for working people this evening when they voted to override Gov. Ehrlich’s ‘Fair Share Health Care’ veto.

<p>Maryland’s working families have sent a clear message to local governments across the country and corporate America by demanding health care fairness—and winning.  

<p>The Fair Share Health Care bill will make corporations like Wal-Mart—with $10 billion a year in profits—pay a fair share of their employees’ health care costs so that workers can afford to take their kids to the doctor when they need it, and companies that provide decent health care will not be at a competitive disadvantage. 

<p>The Fair Share Health Care Fund Act, which is also being introduced in 32 other states, will stop large, profitable corporations from freeloading off communities and shifting their employees’ health care insurance costs onto workers, taxpayers and smaller businesses.

<p>We thank the vast majority of the State Senators and State Delegates who voted with Maryland working people.

<p>What the Maryland victory shows is that the tide is turning because working people are not just fed up—they are ready to get active to set our country in a different direction, one state at a time.  The time is ripe for change and we will look to the lessons of the Maryland victory as we move forward with our ‘Fair Share Health Care’ initiative in 32 states.
