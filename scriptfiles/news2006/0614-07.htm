<p>COLUMBUS, Ohio - June 14 - Today, the Rt. Rev. Bishop Gene Robinson; along with Joe Solmonese, president of the Human Rights Campaign; the Rev. Susan Russell, president of Integrity USA; and Harry Knox, director of the Human Rights Campaign Religion and Faith Program; held a press conference urging the Episcopal Church to stay the course toward equality and reject discrimination.

<p>“It’s time we took the Bible back,” said Robinson. “It’s time we took our faith back and stopped having to apologize for being Christian or Jewish or Muslim without having to explain, ‘No, we’re not that kind of a Jew, we’re not that kind of a Christian.’”

<p>“The work that is being done in denominational meetings like this one are accomplishing the difficult task of educating caring people about who our lives, including the fact that we are, as often as not, people of deep faith. It is imperative that the welcome mat stay out — that there be no retreat in the long struggle for justice and equality,” said Solmonese.

<p>“As an Episcopalian I have taken vows to respect the dignity of every human being and as an American citizen I have pledged allegiance to a flag symbolizing liberty and justice for all. Whether in the state or the church, manipulating LGBT lives violates both of those principles and so I believe it is imperative that people of faith opposed to legislating inequity step up and make their voices heard in this critical debate,” said Russell.

<p>Integrity is the leading grassroots voice for the full inclusion of LGBT persons in the Episcopal Church and equal access to its rites.  Through Integrity's evangelism, thousands of LGBT people, estranged from the Episcopal Church and other denominations, have returned to parish life.
