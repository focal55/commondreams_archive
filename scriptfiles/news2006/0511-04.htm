<p>WASHINGTON - May 11 - Congressman Dennis J. Kucinich (D-OH) gave the following speech today on the House floor about the state of the US economy:



<p>“The Dow Jones will hit a record and the nation's economists will be doing their hosannas, but who profits when factories and businesses are closed in the United States and cheap goods made by no rights, no benefits low wage Chinese workers flood our markets?  



<p>“We have an $804 billion dollar trade deficit.  Hello. Since 1982 $4.5 trillion dollars in assets have been transferred from American to foreign owners. Hello.  Wall Street thumps their golden tub for the Wal-Marts and the cigarette-peddling Altrias while record numbers of Americans are laid off, file bankruptcies, lose their homes, their health care and retirement benefits, their savings, and in some cases, their families.  



<p>“Why do we celebrate Wall Street when Wall Street don't celebrate Main Street?    



<p>“Wall Street makes a killing when gas prices soar, health care costs skyrocket and food prices increase.  We need a new way to measure our economy, as in how! many people are working at good paying jobs and have job security? How many have health and retirement benefits?  Let's create economic progress for all in America, not just for a privileged few.”
