<p>WASHINGTON - September 20 - The Green Party became the first alternative political party in history to
          register a national senatorial campaign committee with the Federal Election Commission last week.&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="navigate">The filing sets further precedent because the Democratic and Republican Senate campaign
          committees were grandfathered in when the FEC was formed.  The FEC has never dealt with a request
          to form such a committee.&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="navigate">"We are taking this step because Americans need a viable alternative to the two old parties, and
          the Green Party is serious about offering that alternative," said Teresa Keane, a former Green
          Senate candidate from Oregon and Chair of the eight-member Green Senatorial Campaign Committee.
          "Voters are upset with both the Republican and Democratic parties this year, and are looking for
          candidates who take principled positions on issues that are important to them."&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="navigate">A senatorial campaign committee allows the party to receive and disburse larger contributions, but
          these contributions are still fully regulated, of public record, and are not soft money, which the
          national Green Party has never used, even when it was legal.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="navigate">Dean Myerson, Treasurer of the Green Senatorial Campaign Committee, submitted registration papers
          on the committee's behalf to the Secretary of the Senate and the Federal Election Commission
          earlier this week.&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="navigate">"The Green Party is serious about supporting its candidates for Senate.  Creating this committee
          is a good way to do that," said Dean Myerson, who noted that the committee is finalizing its
          advisory request now and is collecting affidavits of support from the various Green candidates for
          Senate.&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="navigate">The Green Party has nominated 14 senate candidates for 2006, almost half of the Senate
          seats up for election this year. The key issue for many is the Iraq War; Green candidates are
          calling for immediate withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq.&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="navigate">"The war on Iraq is a crime of historic proportions.  With each new day we see more
          evidence of the greed and corruption that led to the decision to engage in this barbaric war for
          oil and geo-strategic control.  America needs Senators who will stand firm against an
          administration bent on using lies and fear to lead the nation into such a
          devastating direction," said David Sole, Green candidate for Senator of
          Michigan &lt;<a href="http://www.stopthewarslate.org/davidsole.html">http://www.stopthewarslate.org/davidsole.html</a>&gt;.&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="navigate">The Green Party plans to follow up on the Green Senatorial Campaign Committee with the
          establishment of a Green Congressional Campaign Committee.&nbsp;</p>
