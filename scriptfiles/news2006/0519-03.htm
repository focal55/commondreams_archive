<p>SAO PAULO / LONDON - May 19 - <span style="font-family: Arial;">Climbers are trying to
occupy the roof and conveyor belts of Cargill’s facility where they have
displayed a banner reading ‘Fora Cargill’ – ‘Cargill get out’. Other volunteers
are also trying to prevent soya being unloaded from barges into the facility. Meanwhile,
the Arctic Sunrise is attempting to occupy the dock of the facility, preventing
barges of soy from arriving and unloading, but is being rammed by a Cargill
vessel. Cargill workers on the dock are reacting violently, and one activist
has been thrown in the river. Eight people have been arrested so far. <br>
<br>
Greenpeace Amazon Forest Campaign Coordinator, Paulo Adario, said: ”American
corporations like Cargill are eating up the Amazon to grow soya. Meat fed on
this soya ends up on supermarket shelves and fast food counters, like Tesco and
Kentucky Fried Chicken, across Europe. Our volunteers will stay here as long as
possible to prevent soya from the world’s most precious rainforest being
exported to Europe to feed chickens, pigs and cows.” <br>
<br>
Recent Greenpeace investigations documented in ‘Eating up the Amazon’ (1),
shows that the Cargill export facility is not only illegal (2) but is also
laundering soya from illegal deforestation to the world market (3). It operates
13 silos in the Amazon rainforest – more than any other company. <br>
<br>
Soya is now a leading cause of rainforest destruction in the Brazilian Amazon.
In total, an estimated 1.2 million hectares of what used to be rainforest have
already - mostly illegally - been destroyed to grow soybeans. Cargill makes no
secret of helping establish soya farms in the Amazon, some of whom are
complicit in other illegal activities such as land grabbing and slavery (4). <br>
<br>
”US corporations like Cargill must stop seeing the Amazon as a place to expand
their soya businesses, and instead see it as the world’s greatest rainforest
that’s in need of urgent protection,” said Greenpeace International forest
campaign coordinator, Gavin Edwards. <br>
<br>
In recent weeks, Greenpeace has taken action in Europe against soya imports
from Cargill’s Amazon port, including preventing soya ships unloading in
Amsterdam. Cargill responded to allegations yesterday claiming that it had an
‘environmentally friendly’ approach to encouraging soya plantations in the
Amazon. But it has made no commitment to curb ongoing deforestation, and will
not actually ensure protection of the Amazon. <br>
<br>
Greenpeace is calling on Cargill and the European food industry to ensure that
the soya and animal feed they buy and use does not contribute to the
destruction of the Amazon and that none of their soya products are genetically
engineered. <br>
<br>
Greenpeace is an independent, campaigning organisation that uses non-violent,
creative confrontation to expose global environmental problems, and to force
solutions essential to a green and peaceful future.</span>
