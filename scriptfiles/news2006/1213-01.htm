<p>LOS ANGELES - December 13 - Rudy Giuliani announced after the November elections that he is forming a committee to explore the possibility of a 2008 bid for President. A recent poll named him the most popular politician in America. But does America have a true picture of who Giuliani really is? Many Americans mainly remember Giuliani for his heroics on September 11. Director Kevin Keating’s blistering documentary, “Giuliani Time,” attempts to widen that view by exploring his questionable history as mayor of New York before 9/11. The film, which premiered in theaters on May 12, 2006, will be released on DVD January 30, 2007. 

<p>The Draft Rudy Giuliani for President Campaign (<a href="http://www.draftrudygiuliani.com">www.draftrudygiuliani.com</a>) has also been active recently. The group announced that they will begin running radio spots in such key states as Iowa and New Hampshire. The group originally went on the attack when the theatrical release of “Giuliani Time” was announced last May, putting out an email Action Alert calling for subscribers “to launch an effective campaign to expose the inaccuracies in ‘Giuliani Time’ and defend America's Mayor.” 

<p>The carefully developed revelations in “Giuliani Time” contrast sharply with the image portrayed by the Draft Rudy campaign. They describe Giuliani as the mayor who “returned accountability to city government and improved the quality of life for all New Yorkers. Under Mr. Giuliani's leadership, New York City became the best-known example of the resurgence of urban America.”

<p>Ever since the events of 9/11, Rudy Giuliani has become a name recognized the world over.  His role as mayor during the catastrophe elevated him to the status of an international hero.  Kevin Keating’s fascinating doc examines the breadth of Giuliani’s mayoralty through a wide-range of interviews that include: former police commissioner William S. Bratton, former New York mayors, conservative policy-makers, journalists, policemen, homeless people, artists and even Donald Trump. Anthony Kaufman of UTNE Magazine believes, “With Giuliani's post-9/11 resurrection as a hero, ‘Giuliani Time’ should be required viewing before the next election cycle.”

<p>The film began when a prominent constitutional lawyer approached Keating’s company, K Video Productions, concerned about Giuliani’s restrictions on free speech and his fractious relationship with the media. Keating quickly found himself enveloped in the events surrounding Giuliani and the devastating turn his political career was taking. 

<p>Cinema Libre Studio, the independent studio known for distributing socially conscious titles, will be releasing the film on DVD January 30. “Now that Giuliani has thrown his hat into the ring, it is more important than ever that people get an accurate view of him,” says Arik Ben Treston, President of Distribution at Cinema Libre Studio. “With all eyes on Giuliani, this film is sure to change many people’s views.” 

<p>“Giuliani Time” won best documentary at the Silver Lake Film Festival earlier this year. It has been called “first rate,” (Jay Weissburg, Variety) “blistering” (Kevin Crust, Los Angeles Times) and “riveting.” (Jeff Craig, Sixty Second Preview)
