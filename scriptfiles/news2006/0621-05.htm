<p>DETROIT - June 21 - The federal 
government should not be allowed to avoid judicial review of the National 
Security Agency's illegal spying program by invoking the state secrets 
privilege, argued the American Civil Liberties Union in legal papers released 
today.<BR><BR>The move is the latest step in the ACLU's landmark lawsuit challenging 
the NSA program. The government is attempting to prevent the case from going 
forward by invoking a legal doctrine known as the "state secrets 
privilege."<BR><BR>"This administration is radically trying to expand the state 
secrets privilege to shield its own illegal conduct," said Ann Beeson, ACLU 
Associate Legal Director. "There are no more facts - let alone secret ones - 
needed for the court to decide whether the president can violate the law and the 
Constitution by spying on innocent Americans without a warrant." <BR><BR>The ACLU 
argued that the government cannot claim that the case involves state secrets 
because it has acknowledged and defended the spying program to the public. In 
fact, on January 19, the Justice Department issued a 40-page White Paper 
discussing in detail its legal defenses and justifications for the NSA program. 
President Bush and Vice President Cheney have discussed and promoted the program 
numerous times at news conferences and other public events. <BR><BR>Government officials 
have also publicly testified before Congress about the legality, scope and basis 
for the NSA surveillance program on several occasions. <BR><BR>The ACLU warned that 
dismissing the entire lawsuit on state secrets grounds would be an attack on the 
authority of the courts to review any egregious action taken by the executive 
branch, including the torture of Americans within U.S. borders. <BR><BR>While the 
government cloaked its motion in "rhetoric about state secrets and presidential 
duties," its real purpose is clear, said the ACLU. The government seeks to 
dismiss not just the ACLU suit, but to prevent any court from ruling on the 
legality of the program. The government has also moved to dismiss other legal 
challenges against the NSA and has intervened to urge dismissal of lawsuits 
filed against telecommunications companies around the country seeking to block 
their participation in the program.<BR><BR>"Allowing the Executive to violate the 
law and then avoid judicial scrutiny altogether by invoking the state secrets 
privilege as a bar to litigation would dangerously concentrate all executive, 
legislative, and judicial power in one branch of government," argued the ACLU in 
its brief, which was filed in federal court last night.<BR><BR>Courts have 
previously recognized that the state secrets privilege should not be used 
lightly, noting that there are grave consequences when it is used to dismiss an 
entire case.<BR><BR>In the 1953 case, <EM>United States v. Reynolds,</EM> the Supreme Court 
articulated the basis for the state secrets privilege. The government had 
claimed that disclosing a military flight accident report would jeopardize 
secret military equipment and harm national security. Nearly 50 years later, in 
2004, the truth came out: the accident report contained no state secrets, but 
instead confirmed that the cause of the crash was faulty maintenance of the B-29 
fleet.<BR><BR>The ACLU's federal lawsuit was filed in U.S. District Court in the 
Eastern District of Michigan. A hearing to discuss the state secrets privilege 
will be held on July 10 before Judge Anna Diggs Taylor in Detroit.<BR><BR>The 
government also filed a motion this week to consolidate the ACLU lawsuit with 
other NSA challenges across the country, and transfer the case to the District 
of Columbia. The ACLU intends to oppose the motion.<BR><BR>Attorneys in the case are 
Beeson, Jameel Jaffer, Melissa Goodman and Scott Michelman of the national ACLU, 
and Michael Steinberg and Kary Moss of the ACLU of Michigan.<BR><BR>The ACLU brief 
is online at <A class=noline_blue href="http://www.aclu.org/safefree/nsaspying/25954lgl20060620.html">www.aclu.org/safefree/nsaspying/25954lgl20060620.html</A><BR><BR>For
