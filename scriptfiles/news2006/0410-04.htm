<p>BROOKLYN, New York - April 10 - Taxpayers rushing to the IRS or 
post offices on Monday, April 17, the last day to 
file 2005 taxes, will be greeted by signs and 
banners protesting the use of taxes for war. And, 
from Chico, California, to Fort Collins, 
Colorado, and Louisville, Kentucky, to Cambridge 
Massachusetts, members of the public will be 
asked to take a "penny poll," by dropping coins 
into jars representing budget categories to show 
how they would like their tax money disbursed.

<p>      These informal penny polls show year 
after year that funding education, health care, 
and human resources are the highest priorities, 
with the Pentagon receiving a much smaller share. 
This result is consistent with a February 2005 
study by the Program on International Policy 
Attitudes where adult Americans favored increases 
in social spending and gave military spending the deepest cut averaging 31%.*

<p>   With over $5 billion per month going 
to pay for war and occupation in Iraq and 
Afghanistan, and the death toll in military 
personnel and civilians increasing each day, 
anger is rising over the gluttonous use of 
resources-human and monetary-consumed by war. In 
many cases the people holding the signs will be 
individuals who openly refuse to pay some or all 
of their income taxes because they cannot in good conscience pay for war.

<p> Each year the National War Tax 
Resistance Coordinating Committee (NWTRCC) 
collects a list of tax day actions to share with 
activists and the media (see below). This year 
the list includes activities in over 35 cities 
and town. In Portland, Oregon, Berkeley, 
California, and Madison, Wisconsin, war tax 
resisters will publicly redirect their federal 
tax dollars to community organizations. 
Redirection is an intricate part of refusing to 
pay federal taxes to the IRS; resisters instead 
pay their taxes by giving the money to 
organizations that meet human needs, care for 
victims of war, and work for peace and justice.

<p> Along with redirection ceremonies 
and vigils, hundreds of activists around the 
country will hand out informational leaflets 
detailing for passers-by how their income tax 
money is really used. The National Priorities 
Project calculates the cost of the Iraq war per 
household at $3,000, and the War Resisters 
League's analysis of the Bush administration's 
budget puts military spending at 49% of the federal budget. **

<p>  Rebecca Nellenbeck of Ithaca, New 
York, made the decision to refuse to pay for war 
for the first time in 2005. "There is so much 
money. There just isn't enough to pay for 
endless, illegitimate, illegal, unjust wars and 
care for our children, not to mention pay for 
education and healthcare." Rather than send her 
income tax money to the IRS, she chose to give it 
to a veterans' hospital, her local post office 
and library, and a health care fund.

<p>   The National War Tax Resistance 
Coordinating Committee (NWTRCC), founded in 1982, 
is a coalition of local, regional and national 
groups to provide information and support to 
people who are conscientious objectors to paying taxes for war.
