<p>WASHINGTON - November 2 - 
<p align="left"><em>&#8220;We know there was a time, not so long ago, when black people in this country couldn&#8217;t marry the person of their choice either. That&#8217;s why when I am asked, &#8216;Are gay rights civil rights?&#8217; my answer is always, &#8216;Of course they are.&#8217;&#8221;</em></p>

<p><b>WHY:</b><BR>
On the eve of critical midterm elections, Julian Bond, longtime civil rights leader and NAACP chairman, will address a gathering of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender leaders in Miami. In the face of a contentious and prolonged national debate over equal rights for LGBT people, Bond has taken an unequivocal position: &#8220;&#8230;when I am asked, &#8216;Are gay rights civil rights?&#8217; my answer is always, &#8216;Of course.&#8217;&#8221; Bond will be honored by the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force, the country&#8217;s oldest LGBT advocacy organization, for his outstanding and courageous support of LGBT rights. As a national civil rights leader, his contribution to the current struggle for equality stands as a beacon of hope in a time when few have shown the courage to face down anti-gay political and religious leaders who malign lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender citizens for political gain.
