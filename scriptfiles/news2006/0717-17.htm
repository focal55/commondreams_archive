<p>WASHINGTON - July 17 - 

Israel has bombed homes of Hezbollah leaders and the group's Al Manar TV 
station while likening the group to al-Qaeda. But a Washington <i>Post </i>
reporter <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/07/14/AR2006071401401.html?sub=AR" target="_new">wrote</a> yesterday that "[Hezbollah leader Hassan] Nasrallah has 
only disdain for bin Laden and the Taliban. In April, an al-Qaeda cell 
in Lebanon tried to assassinate him."

    AbuKhalil is author of several books on the Mideast including 
"Historical Dictionary of Lebanon." He has just returned from several 
weeks in Lebanon, where he met with Hezbollah leader Nasrallah among 
others. AbuKhalil is a professor in the department of politics at 
California State University, Stanislaus, and a visiting professor at the 
University of California, Berkeley.

    Barsamian is host of the program "Alternative Radio" and was 
recently in Lebanon. He said today: "There is a context of the current 
round of bombings and reprisals. It's clear that Iran has influence and 
has armed and trained Hezbollah, but Hezbollah is an authentic 
indigenous Lebanese group. And we can talk about Iranian-made missiles, 
but Israel is using U.S.-made missiles. Some people are ascribing every 
conceivable atrocity to Hezbollah without serious evidence. It's crucial 
to understand why Hezbollah has such an important role in Lebanon. There 
are many devoted to the group -- and even Lebanese who hate Hezbollah 
admire them for their incorruptibility and the fact that they are 
responsible for having driven Israel out of Lebanon.
<p>"Also, Hezbollah provides services -- day care centers, hospitals, 
clinics, schools, vocational training to people, particularly the Shia 
who are typically looked down at by the upper classes in Lebanon. The 
Shia are underrepresented in the parliament -- they probably constitute 
about 45 percent of the population -- but don't get adequate 
representation in Lebanon's system, particularly since Lebanon hasn't 
had a census since 1932."

     Makdisi holds the Arab-American Educational Foundation Chair of 
Arab Studies at Rice University. He is author of the paper 
"Anti-Americanism in the Arab World: An Interpretation of a Brief 
History." Makdisi said today: "What the U.S. government is doing now -- 
basically giving Israel a blank check for bombing Lebanon, including the 
civilian infrastructure -- is exactly the type of policy that causes 
resentment against the U.S. in the region."
<p>Makdisi is the author of the book "The Culture of Sectarianism" 
about Lebanon. He added: "Even people who are opposed to Hezbollah in 
Lebanon are not going to say anything because the Israeli assault is so 
egregious. ... Israel has created its worst enemies -- they helped 
create Hamas as a counterweight to Fatah and their occupation of Lebanon 
created Hezbollah. ... Hezbollah has substantial respect in the region 
because, unlike the regimes, it has actually done what it says it will do."
