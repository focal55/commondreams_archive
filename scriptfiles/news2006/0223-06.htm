<p>WASHINGTON - February 23 - Cashing in on the  promise of a quick fix, tens of thousands of low-income workers  in the District of Columbia paid more than $2.6 million in  unnecessary fees and excessive interest when they filed their  taxes in 2004 to expedite collection of their tax refunds.  An  analysis of IRS data by the Children's Defense Fund (CDF) found  that most Refund Anticipation Loan (RAL) customers were low- income taxpayers who claimed the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC),  a refundable credit for low-wage earners, even though they only  make up 19 percent of all taxpayers.</p>
<p>   Throughout the United States, low-income workers paid more  than $900 million unnecessarily in RAL fees and interest to  receive their tax refunds more quickly. </p>
<p>   For the 2003 tax year, more than 20,000 D.C. workers purchased  Refund Anticipation Loans (RALs) -- short-term, high-interest  loans that commercial tax preparers aggressively market to low- income tax filers in exchange for receiving their tax refunds  sooner, usually within a few days. Some RAL providers deliver  these high-priced loans on-the-spot. </p>
<p>   RALs are repaid from the tax refund, but the fees associated  with them end up costing individuals a significant percentage of  their refunds. Meanwhile, tax refunds from the federal government  impose no fees or interest charges and if e-filed and deposited  into an account are usually paid within two weeks of filing. In  reducing the value of the refund taxpayers receive, RALs  undermine the very purpose of the EITC, which is to help lift  low-income families out of poverty.</p>
<p>   "Taking money out of the pockets of working poor families in  the form of excessive interest rates and fees paid through RALs  is unjust and indefensible," said Marian Wright Edelman,  president of the Children's Defense Fund. "Now more than ever we  need to make certain that working families get back every dollar  for which they are eligible to help cover expenses like food,  rent, utilities and child care so that they can stay employed and  keep their families intact."</p>
<p>   Three years ago, CDF launched a nationwide Tax and Benefits  Outreach Initiative to ensure children and working families  receive tax, income, health insurance and other benefits for  which they are eligible.  </p>
<p>   Last year, working in conjunction with the Internal Revenue  Service and hundreds of faith and community groups across the  country, CDF and coalition partners helped raise awareness and  set up free tax preparation services to allow families to claim - - and keep -- more than $105 million in tax refunds nationally  and nearly $1 million in Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>   CDF is again participating in the Volunteer Income Tax  Assistance (VITA) free tax preparation program this year in  coalition with the D.C. EITC Campaign and faith- and community- based partners, helping low-income families learn about and  prepare their taxes free of charge so they can save or spend  their refund -- all of it -- as they see fit. </p>
