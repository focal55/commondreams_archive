<p>WASHINGTON - July 12 - Human Rights Campaign President Joe Solmonese made the following statement on the upcoming vote in the U.S. House of Representatives on the Federal Marriage Amendment. The measure would write discrimination against same-sex couples into the U.S. Constitution by denying marriage and seriously threatening civil unions and domestic partnerships.

<p>“The Constitution is a cherished document that promises freedom, not an instrument of discrimination,” said Solmonese. “That the House is even having a conversation about treating same-sex couples as second-class citizens is inexcusable. There’s never a time for talking about discriminating against a group of Americans with the very document that’s supposed to protect us all.”

<p>Solmonese continued, “Regardless of how this amendment is worded, the intent and the effect are to make GLBT Americans second-class citizens. HRC is working with our allies and mobilizing supporters to send a message to the House that discrimination in the Constitution is wrong. With a vote expected as soon as next Tuesday, it’s vital that all fair-minded Americans call their representative’s office today and every day until the vote.”

<p>The Human Rights Campaign has been lobbying on Capitol Hill; mobilizing its members; engaging the press; and working with a large coalition of civil rights, religious, civil liberties, labor and professional organizations advocating against the measure.

<p>Rep. Marilyn Musgrave, R-Colo., continues to lead efforts to pass this discriminatory amendment in the House. With 129 co-sponsors, Musgrave’s amendment, H.J.R. 88, reads: “Marriage in the United States shall consist only of the union of a man and a woman. Neither this Constitution, nor the constitution of any state, shall be construed to require that marriage or the legal incidents thereof be conferred upon any union other than the union of a man and a woman.”

<p>Another version of the amendment was introduced today by Rep. Louie Gohmert, R-Texas, and has no co-sponsors currently. That version reads: “Marriage in the United States shall consist only of a legal union of one man and one woman.”
