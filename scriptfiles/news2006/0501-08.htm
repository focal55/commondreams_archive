<p>LONDON - May 1 -Four decades of armed conflict in Colombia have had a catastrophic effect on the country's civilians. Caught between the security forces who have consistently colluded with and supported paramilitary groups and, on the other side, armed opposition groups, tens of thousands of people have been killed, "disappeared", tortured or kidnapped, while millions of others have been forcibly displaced.
