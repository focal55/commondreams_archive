<p>WASHINGTON - May 12 - On Tuesday, a conference committee agreed on a tax plan that will reduce taxes by $70
billion over the next five years. The plan includes a raft of new giveaways for wealthy
Americans and corporations, but offers only a temporary fix for what has become a
permanent problem: the expansion of the individual Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT).
What’s In the Conference Committee Plan
<p><b>The agreed-upon tax bill includes $70 billion in tax cuts over the next five years.<br>
</b>
<ul>
<li>The biggest single tax cut in the bill is a one-year extension of previously
enacted cuts in the individual AMT. Congress had earlier enacted a temporary
increase in the AMT exemption to help ensure that only wealthier Americans
would be subject to the tax, but that higher exemption expired at the end of
2005. The bill extends, and slightly increases, the higher exemptions for tax
year 2006 only. The one-year extension carries a price tag of almost $34 billion</li>
<li>The bill also provides a two-year extension of temporary tax breaks for capital
gains and dividends. 2003 legislation lowered the top tax rate on capital gains
and dividends to 15 percent for five years; these temporary cuts had been
scheduled to expired on January 1, 2009. The two-year extension is estimated
to cost $21 billion over the next five years.</li>
<li>The third-most-expensive part of the newest tax cut is an expanded tax break
for businesses investing in new equipment. The new law allows companies to
immediately write off up to $100,000 of the cost of new equipment. The fiveyear
cost of this new tax break: $7.3 billion.</li>
<li>The new law also provides a corporate tax break, worth almost $5 billion over
the next five years, to companies such as General Electric and Citigroup by
allowing them avoid paying taxes on certain income shifted overseas.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>What’s Not In the Conference Committee Plan </b>
<p>The Alternative Minimum Tax remains
a major concern for Congressional
tax writers even after the passage
of this latest tax cut: as the chart
at right shows, the agreed-upon
higher exemption will expire at the
end of 2006. CTJ has estimated that if
the exemption is allowed to fall back
to its currently-scheduled levels in 2007, more than 15 million Americans will be forced
to pay the AMT for the first time.
<p>The main reason for Congress’ reluctance to provide more than a one-year patch for
what has become a permanent problem? Its cost. House and Senate negotiators could
agree on “only” a $70 billion tax cut over five years—and even a two-year extension of
Alternative Minimum Tax relief would eat up most, if not all, of that amount.
<p>“Every member of Congress knows that a second year of AMT relief will be enacted, at
a cost of at least $40 billion,” said CTJ Director Robert S. McIntyre. “By excluding this
needed AMT reform from this tax bill, Congress is trying to fit two pounds of sugar in a
one-pound bag.”
<p>The agreed-upon tax bill is also notable for its exclusion of a variety of “extenders”—
temporary tax cuts, mostly for businesses, that have expired or are about to expire.
These tax cuts are widely supported among Congressional tax writers—and will likely
cost at least $20 billion over five years.<!-- #EndEditable -->
