<p>WASHINGTON - September 13 - Two &quot;comeback kids&quot;  who championed gun violence prevention upset both the  conventional wisdom and established opponents in Maryland  yesterday.</p>
<p>   Incumbent Maryland State Senator John Giannetti was unseated  by his Democratic primary opponent, former ambassador Jim  Rosapepe, who pounded Giannetti for killing the state's assault  rifle ban in a prior session of the legislature. And in an open  race for another State Senate seat in Maryland, newcomer  candidate Mike Lenett won easily over established state  legislators by stressing his support from Sarah Brady.  The two  candidates were endorsed by both the Brady Campaign and CeaseFire  Maryland, Inc.</p>
<p>   &quot;I couldn't have won this race without the help of Sarah and  Jim Brady and the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence,&quot;  Rosapepe said. &quot;I'm glad the people of the 21st District support  my efforts to get assault weapons off Maryland streets once and  for all.&quot;</p>
<p>   The Brady Campaign and CeaseFire Maryland, Inc. worked on  behalf of both candidates through hard-hitting email campaigns,  press events, endorsements, contributions, direct mail and  automated phone calls from Sarah Brady.</p>
<p>   &quot;The support of Sarah Brady and the Brady Campaign were a  great help in my victory,&quot; said Lenett.  &quot;The issue of gun  violence really matters to voters in my district, especially when  it comes to getting deadly assault weapons off our streets.&quot;</p>
<p>   The Brady Campaign targeted Senator Giannetti last year, and  endorsed Lenett in February.</p>
<p>   &quot;Over the past year, we have been focusing on Sen. Giannetti  and his opposition to the assault weapons ban.  Now he has  learned a tough lesson -– adopting the gun pushers' dangerous  agenda is not only bad for public safety, it's bad politics,&quot;  said Brady Campaign President Paul Helmke.</p>
<p>   Lenett, as Counsel to the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee and  Committee leaders Joseph Biden (D-DE) and Howard Metzenbaum (D- OH) in the early 1990s, was one of the key staff members in the  U.S. Senate responsible for securing the votes to pass both the  Brady Law and the ban on military-style semiautomatic assault  weapons.  Sarah Brady and the Brady Campaign endorsed him in  February.  &quot;To Jim and me, Mike Lenett is family,&quot; said Sarah  Brady.  &quot;We will never forget how much he did in a historic fight  to keep guns out of the hands of criminals.&quot;</p>
<p>   In the Maryland race in Senate District 21, Rosapepe  consistently hit Giannetti for blocking the assault weapons bill  and thus compromising the safety of his constituents.  The Brady  Campaign announced last year it was naming Senator Giannetti as  one of its principal national targets for the 2006 election  season in a letter to hundreds of thousands of supporters.</p>
<p>   The letter said &quot;We will also punish those state legislators  who stand in the way of our legislative priorities… Giannetti  killed the state assault weapons ban.  Senator Giannetti must pay  the price for allowing high-powered killing machines on the  streets of Maryland.  We will target his race and replace him  with someone who will make sensible gun laws a priority.&quot;</p>
<p>   &quot;Marylanders are lucky to have Jim Rosapepe and Mike Lenett  heading to the Maryland Senate,&quot; Lisa Delity, President of  CeaseFire Maryland, Inc said. &quot;They will champion a ban on deadly  assault rifles and protect public safety by pushing strong and  sensible gun laws in Maryland.&quot;</p>
<p>   As the nation's largest, non-partisan, grassroots organization  leading the fight to prevent gun violence, the Brady Campaign,  working with its dedicated network of Million Mom March Chapters,  is devoted to creating an America free from gun violence, where  all Americans are safe at home, at school, at work, and in our  communities.</p>
