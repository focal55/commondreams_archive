<p>WASHINGTON - February 1 - President Bush's State of the Union speech was delivered following 
 almost two weeks of unremitting reports of record profits from the 
 major oil and gas companies. These reports come even as Americans 
 watch their fuel costs skyrocket. Thus, when President Bush called, 
 not only for the end of dependence on foreign oil, but also for 
 increased research and innovation in the areas of fuel economy and alternative sources of energy, we listened attentively. His goals are 
 worthy, but immediate, serious steps must be taken to ensure lasting 
 success. ADA, therefore, calls on the President to request, and the 
 Congress to enact, a windfall profits tax on oil and refinery 
 companies.
 
<p> Exxon Mobil is the latest company to report record profits reaping 
 over $10 billion in profits in the fourth quarter of 2005, the largest 
 quarterly profit of any company in U.S. history. Adding in the numbers 
 from Chevron and ConocoPhillips brings the total for the three leading 
 U.S. companies to $18.5 billion in profits for the fourth quarter. 
 These companies are gouging consumers even as they line their own 
 pockets by selling, at exorbitant prices, a product that is essential 
 for everyday life. Company executives and spokespersons have offered a 
 list of excuses, each one more outrageous than the last. A windfall 
 profits tax will force the gluttonous energy industry to share the 
 burden of ordinary working Americans.
 
<p>Unfortunately, because the energy industry contributed over $50 million in individual and PAC donations to federal candidates and 
 office holders in the 2004 cycle, leadership on this issue might be 
 hard to find. Step one of the President's initiative should be for the 
 President and Congress to end their own dependency on oil money. Then 
 Congress should enact and the President should sign a windfall profits 
 tax.
