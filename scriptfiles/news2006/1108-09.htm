<p>WORCESTER, Massachusetts - November 8 - The Massachusetts  Chapter of Americans United for Separation of Church and State  has urged members of the Massachusetts Legislature to block a  proposed amendment to the Constitution that would define legal  marriage as being only between a man and a woman.</p>
<p>   The legislature is scheduled to vote on Thursday on whether to  add H-653 to the state Constitution. Americans United now asks  the public to contact their state senator and state  representative and ask them to vote against H-653. This amendment  also prevents the recognition of civil unions or any other legal  equivalent of marriage for same-sex couples.</p>
<p>   Americans United said the measure would write discrimination  into the Constitution and would favor the marriage doctrines and  rituals of some religious groups over others. Further, there is  no need for such an amendment because nothing in the law at  either the federal or state level allows any court or legislature  to require any religious institution or person to perform any  type of marriage ceremony. Given that houses of worship are  already protected from governmental interference in decisions of  who to marry, constitutional definitions of marriage are  therefore wholly unnecessary.</p>
<p>   &quot;The proposed amendment,&quot; said Ronal C. Madnick, president of  the Massachusetts Chapter of Americans United, &quot;is a wrong- headed, mean-spirited and an ignoble campaign to write  discrimination into the Massachusetts Constitution.&quot;</p>
