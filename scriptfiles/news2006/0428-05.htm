<p>NEW YORK - April 28 - The Backbone Campaign will launch the "Bush and Co. Chain Gang" at the Saturday, April 29 March for Peace, Justice and Democracy in New York City. The march begins north of Union Square and proceeds south along Broadway to Foley Square. The Backbone Campaign will also parade its giant, 70-foot puppet of a human spine, festooned with slogans of an interlocking progressive agenda. 

<p>"The Backbone Campaign is insisting on both accountability AND a bold, inspiring vision for the future. The March for Peace, Justice and Democracy comes at a crucial moment," says Bill Moyer, Executive Director of the Backbone Campaign. "This march represents and affirms the diversity, unity, and potential of the progressive movement." 

<p>"Most representatives in Congress," Moyer continues, "seem not to understand the level of discontent in this country. We are not getting adequate leadership from either party, and we are tired of waiting." 

<p>The newly-created Chain Gang features giant puppet heads of Dick Cheney, Condoleeza Rice, Donald Rumsfeld, and President Bush, wearing black-and-white-striped prison uniforms. The Chain Gang project is intended to provide a humorous face to serious calls for Bush Administration accountability. The Backbone Campaign insists that impeachment is not an optional political tactic, but a Constitutional obligation to protect Americans from an Administration that sees itself as above the law.

<p>The Chain Gang will tour the country for "Work Release" appearances. After their debut in NYC, they will travel to Berkeley, CA. Future stops include Washington, D.C.; San Diego; Seattle; Crawford, Texas; and other cities. While the characters pick up trash and break rocks, they'll also be sending a message that will spark the imaginations and stoke the desires of many citizens to resurrect accountability in Washington, D.C. 

<p>The four heads were built by a crew of volunteers on Vashon Island, Washington, home of the Backbone Campaign. The process was led by artist Bill Jarcho, who has a rich background in animation, directing, and puppetry. 

<p>The Backbone Campaign, a leader in the use of political theater as metaphor and spectacle, is a grassroots effort to embolden citizens and elected officials to stand up for progressive values. The organization provides creative tools for citizens and the progressive movement to expand the political dialogue. The backbone symbolizes an interlocking agenda, a coalition, and the personal courage necessary to fight for a future worthy of our children.
