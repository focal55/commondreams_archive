<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON - January 27 -  The&#160;Washington state Senate 
passed a bill today protecting gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender 
people from discrimination, making&#160;Washington the 17th state to ban discrimination based on sexual 
orientation and the seventh state based on gender identity. For 
procedural reasons the bill was sent back to the House, which already 
passed the bill. It now goes to Gov. Christine Gregoire, who pledged to 
sign it.</font></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#8220;States 
like&#160;Washington&#160; are picking up the 
slack as fairness remains stalled in Congress,&#8221; said Human Rights 
Campaign President Joe Solmonese. &#8220;More than one-third of 
Americans now live in a state where it&#8217;s illegal to fire a 
hard-working employee just for being gay.&#8221;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A broad-based coalition 
of religious organizations, large and small businesses, civil rights 
groups and concerned citizens advocated for the bill. Leading supporters 
include Washington employers Microsoft, Boeing, 
Corbis, Hewlett Packard, Levi Strauss &amp; Co., 
Nike and RealNetworks weathering calls for boycotts by extremist 
organizations.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#8220;Businesses support 
non-discrimination protections because recruiting and retaining the best 
talent is good for their bottom line,&#8221; said Solmonese. 
&#8220;Fair-minded consumers, employees and investors will not soon 
forget their leadership on ensuring fairness.&#8221;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A sexual orientation 
non-discrimination bill was first introduced in the Washington 
Legislature in 1976. It failed by one vote in the state 
Senate last year.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#8220;These important legal 
protections are the product of decades of work by thousands of 
Washingtonians committed to equal treatment for every citizen,&#8221; 
said Solmonese. &#8220;We applaud Equal Rights Washington and other 
groups who are opening hearts and minds in communities across the 
state.&#8221;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Over the past year, the 
Human Rights Campaign has worked closely with Equal Rights Washington in 
coordinating grassroots efforts to pass the non-discrimination bill. HRC 
has also provided substantial funding for advertising, polling and 
administrative support in addition to sending more than 10 staff members 
to Washington. Additionally, HRC helped to garner 
business support for the bill by working with various large 
corporations.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>The Human Rights Campaign is 
the largest national lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender political 
organization with members throughout the country.&#160;It effectively 
lobbies Congress, provides campaign support and educates the public to 
ensure that LGBT Americans can be open, honest and safe at home, at work 
and in the community.</i></font></p>
