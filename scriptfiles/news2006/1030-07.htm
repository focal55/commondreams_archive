<p>WASHINGTON - October 30 - A former U.S. Coast  Guard cutter, overhauled and refitted by World Wildlife Fund,  began patrolling the waters of the Galapagos today as the first  National Park Service vessel fast enough to outrun and catch  poachers at sea.</p>
<p>   With the arrival of the 95-foot-long Yoshka, national park  officials, &quot;finally have the means to catch poachers and combat  the illegal fishing that threatens the outstanding marine life of  the Galapagos Islands,&quot; said Lauren Spurrier, managing director  of WWF's Galapagos program. &quot;This boat is faster than anything  else out there.&quot;</p>
<p>   Park patrols protect wildlife within the marine park from  illegal activities like shark-finning or industrial fishing for  highly-valued fish, and destructive fishing practices like  longlines that kill non-target wildlife. Previously, outlaws  eluded park patrols by outrunning them at sea. &quot;That's about to  change,&quot; Spurrier said. </p>
<p>   &quot;Illegal fishing is a serious threat in the archipelago, so  we're really grateful for WWF's support in rebuilding the  Yoshka,&quot; said Raquel Molina, director of the Galapagos National  Park. &quot;With the Yoshka patrolling the park, we'll be better able  to monitor activities and enforce laws within the reserve. We  know that laws are not being followed; in the past two years,  we've seized more than 23,586 shark fins and 668,892 sea  cucumbers illegally fished inside the Galapagos Marine Reserve.&quot;</p>
<p>   A vessel with a colorful history -- as the USS Cape Knox it  saw action during the Cuban missile crisis and played a key role  in transporting refugees to Miami during the Cuban refugee exodus  of 1965 -- the Yoshka was owned by the Sea Shepherd Society and  on loan to the park in 2004, but it badly needed extensive  repairs. WWF secured funding for the needed repairs and  improvements and brokered an agreement under which the society  subsequently donated the cutter to the Galapagos National Park  Service.  </p>
<p>   Overhauled in dry dock at Guayaquil, Ecuador, the Yoshka can  now reach a top speed of 22 knots and navigate for seven to 12  days without having to return to refuel, enabling law enforcement  officials to extend their patrols to the park's outer areas.</p>
<p>   As a protector of the archipelago where unique species  inspired Darwin's theory of natural evolution, the boat was  christened the Yoshka in honor of a donor's Russian family member  who loved nature.</p>
<p>   The Galapagos Marine Reserve is the third largest reserve in  the world, encompassing an area roughly the size of New York  State. A stunning number of animals live on and around the  Galapagos, and many of these are found nowhere else on Earth. In  the waters of the Galapagos, some 300 species of fish swim with  seven species of sharks, rays, turtles, penguins and marine  iguanas above a vast array of urchins, sea cucumbers, crabs,  anemones, sponges and corals. The archipelago is home to some of  the largest colonies of seabirds anywhere in the world.</p>
