<p>HARRISBURG, Pennsylvania - August 25 - Consumers Union is  calling on hospitals across the country to take more aggressive  steps to protect patients from Methicillin-resistant  Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) - related infections in light of a  new Pennsylvania study documenting the serious financial and  health costs associated with such infections.</p>
<p>   The report by the Pennsylvania Health Care Cost Containment  Council (PHC4) is the first in the nation with statewide  statistics on hospitalizations of patients with MRSA.  The  Pennsylvania agency found 13,722 patients with MRSA, based on  2004 data, the latest available.  MRSA patients are four times  more likely to die and stayed in the hospital two and a half  times longer than patients without the antibiotic-resistant  infection.  Hospital charges for patients with MRSA were three  times higher than charges for patients without the infections.</p>
<p>   &quot;The prevalence of MRSA in every hospital in the U.S. poses a  very serious health risk to patients who are unwittingly exposed  to these superbugs,&quot; said Lisa McGiffert, director of Consumers  Union's Stop Hospital Infections campaign.  &quot;Unfortunately, most  hospitals do not even know which patients have MRSA and are  failing to follow strategies and precautions proven to keep these  germs in check.&quot;</p>
<p>   The PHC4 report does not distinguish between community- and  healthcare-acquired MRSA infections.  While community-acquired  MRSA infections are becoming increasingly common, recent CDC  sponsored research shows that 80-91 percent of such infections  are picked up in the hospital or other health care setting.</p>
<p>   MRSA infections have become resistant to most common  antibiotics, though they generally respond to intravenous  vancomycin.  It is mainly spread in hospitals by contact with  unwashed hands or contaminated gloves.  According to the National  Quality Forum, studies show that hand washing compliance rates in  hospitals are generally less than 50 percent.</p>
<p>   While strict hand washing is the fundamental strategy for  prevention, health care experts at a recent Boston meeting on  MRSA agreed that multiple actions must be taken to effectively  curb MRSA.  Successful &quot;bundles&quot; include screening high risk  patients with active surveillance cultures, using  gowns/gloves/masks when treating these patients (&quot;barrier  precautions&quot;), aggressive compliance with hand hygiene and other  precautions, and routine decontamination of the hospital  environment (patient rooms and operating rooms).  This type of  approach has been endorsed by the Society for Healthcare  Epidemiology of America (SHEA) and is the subject of long-awaited  guidelines from CDC, but most hospitals do not follow it.</p>
<p>   Hospitals that do follow this protocol have documented very  impressive results.  The University of Pittsburgh Medical Center  has reduced MRSA in several of its intensive control units by 90  percent and similar results have been documented at the  University of Virginia Health System. Hospitals in the  Netherlands have used these strategies to successfully control  MRSA for decades.</p>
<p>   &quot;For years now, hospital officials have watched as MRSA rates  have climbed and more and more patients have suffered from these  superbugs,&quot; said McGiffert.  &quot;It's time for hospitals to start  following infection control procedures proven to minimize the  spread of MRSA.  There should be zero tolerance for these  infections because these are human lives at stake, not just  numbers.&quot;</p>
