<p>CURITIBA - March 13 - Greenpeace today called upon the 
representatives of the 132 member states of the International Biosafety 
Protocol to agree upon reliable and fair standards of identification and 
labelling of genetically engineered organisms (GMOs) in international 
shipments of food and feed products. (1)

<p>Earlier today Greenpeace also handed over to the Clearinghouse and 
Secretariat of the UN-Agreement a ground-breaking Contamination Report 
documenting 113 incidents of contamination, illegal releases and 
negative agricultural impacts of genetically engineered crops.(2)

<p>"What's at stake at this meeting is environmental and consumer safety," 
said Greenpeace International's GE expert Benedikt Haerlin from the 
meeting in Curitiba. "This time it is imperative that the international 
community gets it right - it must ensure that   genetically engineered 
food and feed will not ultimately be spread on to unsuspecting producers 
and consumers in importing countries. The majority of developing 
countries without national GMO legislation in place are dependent on the 
International Biosafety Protocol to protect them."

<p>At the last set of negotiations of the Protocol in 2005, a powerful 
coalition of trade, agro-industry and science lobbyists in alliance with 
the USA, Canada and Argentina, who have not ratified the Protocol, 
successfully lobbied to prevent clear labelling rules and promoted 
meaningless "may contain GMOs" language instead. Protocol members Brazil 
and New Zealand finally blocked a draft agreement on Article 18.2 (a) 
which provides for identification of international shipments of LMOs 
intended for feed, food and processing.

<p>"Brazilian President  Ignacio Lula has a golden opportunity at this 
meeting in his own country to show leadership on the Protocol," said 
Haerlin. "Lula and his cabinet must put   the protection of biodiversity 
and the poor countries of the world above   the demands and interests of 
the likes of the US and of Agro-industry giants like Monsanto and Cargill."
 
<p>"Greenpeace and GeneWatch's  GM Contamination Report may just cover the 
tip of the iceberg - contamination is spreading much faster than we can 
document it - but it is undeniable proof  of  the need for global 
bio-safety and labelling standards of GE crops," concluded Haerlin.(3)

<p>Greenpeace is an independent campaigning organisation that uses 
non-violent creative confrontation to expose global environmental 
problems to force solutions that are essential to a green and peaceful 
future
