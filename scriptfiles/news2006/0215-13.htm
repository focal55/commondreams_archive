<p>   SPEAKERS:</p>
<p>   -- Jonathan Gruber, professor of Economics, MIT</p>
<p>   -- Edwin Park, senior health policy analyst, CBPP</p>
<p>   -- Jason Furman, senior fellow, CBPP</p>
<p>   DETAILS:</p>
<p>   The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities will hold a  conference call briefing on Thursday, February 16 at 1 p.m. (ET)  to present the results of a new study of the President's Health  Savings Accounts and related proposals by M.I.T. economist  Jonathan Gruber, who is widely regarded as one of the nation's  leading health economists.</p>
<p>   Using a model originally developed with support from the  Kaiser Family Foundation, Professor Gruber has examined both the  extent to which the President's proposals would enable people who  otherwise would be uninsured to gain coverage and the extent to  which it would induce employers to drop coverage and cause some  previously insured people to become uninsured.  Professor  Gruber's study assesses the effects of each element of the  President's proposals, as well as the overall effects on the  number of uninsured.</p>
<p>   Gruber enjoys an outstanding reputation in the economics  field.  In addition to his position at M.I.T., Gruber is Director  of the Program on Children at the National Bureau of Economic  Research, a co-editor of the Journal of Health Economics,  Associate Editor of the Journal of Public Economics, and the  recipient of various awards, including the Kenneth Arrow Award  for the Best Paper in Health Economics (in 1994).</p>
<p>   After an initial presentation, Professor Gruber will take  questions. Center analysts who have conducted substantial  analysis on these issues also will be available during the Q and  A segment.</p>
