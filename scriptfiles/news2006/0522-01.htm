<p>LONDON / PARIS - May 22 - To mark the UN's International Day for 
Biological Diversity today, Greenpeace activists continued their global 
actions against the world's largest privately-owned company, US 
commodities giant, Cargill, for destroying the Amazon rainforest to grow 
soya to feed Europe's farm animals.

<p>This morning, 18 activists in Orléans, France, closed down a 
Cargill-owned Sun Valley factory. Many of the million chickens which Sun 
Valley supplies to supermarkets and fast food restaurants across Europe 
every week are fed on Amazon soya. In Surrey, UK, Greenpeace dumped 
nearly four tonnes of soya at the entrance of Cargill's European 
Headquarters where Cargill managers organise the shipping of hundreds of 
thousands of tonnes of Amazon soya to Europe. Several activists  chained 
themselves to a gate to prevent the company's 300 employees gaining 
access to the site.

<p>Greenpeace Amazon campaign co-ordinator, Thomas Henningsen, said: "Most 
people have never even heard of this company, but its playing a part in 
one of the great environmental tragedies of our time. The Amazon is one 
of the most bio-diverse areas on Earth and we need it to stabilise the 
planet's climate, but this company is trashing the rainforest to grow 
soya to feed Europe's farm animals. We'll stay here until Cargill agrees 
to a moratorium to stop destroying the Amazon rainforest. Until it does, 
companies like KFC, Tesco and Albert Heijn should avoid buying Cargill's 
Amazon-fed products."

<p>Today's protests followed a series of tense protests in the over the 
weekend in the Brazilian city of Santarem, in the heart of the Amazon 
rainforest, where Cargill has illegally contructed a soya export 
facility. On Friday, a team of climbers from the Greenpeace ship, Arctic 
Sunrise, shut down the facility. Cargill workers acted violently during 
the protest, ramming a Greenpeace inflatable boat and the Arctic Sunrise 
with their powerful tugboat. Three activists were injured, with one 
sustaining a broken finger and another suffering burns after having a 
firework launched at him.  On Sunday, over a thousand people from 
Santarem joined Greenpeace and other non-governmental organisations 
reacted by taking to the streets of Santarem in protest against 
Cargilll's destruction of the Amazon.

<p>Recent Greenpeace investigations (1) discovered that Cargill's crimes 
stretch from their illegal operations in the Amazon across the entire 
European food industry. Many of biggest poultry companies in Europe, 
including Cargill-owned Sun Valley Foods which supplies some of the most 
prominent European supermarkets and fast food restaurants, are using 
Cargill soya imported direct from the Amazon rainforest. Soya farmers 
supplying Cargill are linked to the use of slave labour, illegal land 
grabbing and massive deforestation.
 
<p>Cargill is a US-based international food and agricultural commodity 
giant and is leading the soya invasion of the Amazon (2). 1.2 million 
hectares of what used to be rainforest have already - mostly illegally - 
been destroyed to grow soybeans. Forest clearance by burning is 
endangering the world's climate and destroying the habitat of indigenous 
peoples, as well as plants and animals in the most biologically 
important rainforest on earth.

<p>Greenpeace is calling on Cargill and the European food industry to 
ensure that the animal feed they buy does not contribute to the 
destruction of the Amazon and that none of their soya products are 
genetically engineered (3). In a meeting with Greenpeace this month, 
Cargill refused to stop its operations in the Amazon. 

<p>Greenpeace is an independent, campaigning organisation that uses 
non-violent, creative confrontation to expose global environmental 
problems, and to force solutions essential to a green and peaceful future.

<p>Notes to Editors:
<p>(1) Details on that can be found in the report "Eating up the Amazon". A copy is available on: http://www.greenpeace.org/international/press/reports/eating-up-the-amazon.

 <p>(2) Cargill, together with Archer Daniels Midland (ADM) and Bunge,  
controls 60% of soya production in Brazil and more than three-quarters 
of Europe's soya crushing industry that supplies soya meal and oil to 
the animal feed market.

<p>(3) Cargill is a major player in genetically engineered (GE) soya and has bought GE soya grown in some Amazon regions. On 14th May a ship, Tonga, loaded with GE soya arrived in Brest, France from the Brazilian 
port of Paranagua, which is struggling to hold on to its GE free status. 
She was the first ship to bring GE soya from Paranagua into France and 
was chartered by Cargill.
