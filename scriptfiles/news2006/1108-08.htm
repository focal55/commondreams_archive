<p>WASHINGTON - November 8 - ACORN members is four  states -- Missouri, Arizona, Colorado, and Ohio -- celebrated the  overwhelming success of ballot initiative campaigns to raise the  minimum wage. They also applauded the successful efforts of other  coalitions which passed wage increases in Nevada and Montana.</p>
<p>   &quot;Around the country, people came out to vote and did what  politicians have failed to do -- raised the minimum wage. Huge  majorities around the country agree raising wages is the right  thing to do because hard work deserves fair pay,&quot; said Mary Keith  Ohio ACORN's state board chair. &quot;The new U.S. Congress needs to  put a higher minimum wage and the needs of working families on  the top of its agenda.&quot;</p>
<p>   By late Tuesday night, exit polls predicted victory for all  six wage increase initiatives, with especially large wins in  Arizona (66 percent) and Missouri (76 percent).</p>
<p>   Working with a wide range of partners, ACORN helped initiate  and organize these campaigns and coordinated signature-gathering  efforts that qualified them for the ballot. ACORN then ran  ambitious field operations – especially in MO and OH, where  thousands participated. The house-to-house campaign not only  delivered a raise to 1.5 million workers, but also increased  voter participation in the low and moderate income and minority  neighborhoods where ACORN works.</p>
<p>   &quot;Voters were motivated to go to the polls by this initiative,&quot;  Harris continued. &quot;They felt that it was unfair for people to  work for $5.15 and hour when members of Congress have given  themselves raises adding up to $31,000 without ever raising the  minimum wage.&quot;</p>
<p>   ACORN also ran the country's largest registration drive in  2006. ACORN help over 540,000 low income and minority citizens  register to vote in 2006. The 2006 registration drive reached  68,580 new registrants in Michigan, 71,156 in Missouri, 112,953  in Pennsylvania, and 116,366 in Ohio. &quot;Getting people involved in  voting is a fundamental part of ACORN's program,&quot; said ACORN  President Maude Hurd. &quot;It is one of the only ways to make sure  that our communities have a voice that matters when the big  decisions are made.&quot;</p>
<p>   In 20 states around the country, ACORN's volunteers, members  and staff knocked on over 1.5 million doors to talk to their  neighbors about election issues. By Election Day, they reached  580,809 low- and moderate-income, minority, young, and single  working women infrequent voters in 20 states -- often 2 or 3  times each -- and urged them to get out and vote.</p>
<p>   ACORN carried out especially large door-to-door voter outreach  programs statewide in MO, NJ, OH, PA, and RI, and in the  following Congressional Districts:  CO-7, NM-1, OH-1, OH-15, PA- 6, PA-7, and TX-22.  Over 4100 ACORN volunteers and GOTV  canvassers worked on Election Day. A grassroots network of ACORN  Precinct Action Leaders (APALs) organized their neighbors to vote  in 19 cities.</p>
<p>   Key national partners in the national ballot initiative effort  included the AFL-CIO, the National Education Association, the  Brennan Center for Justice at NYU School of Law, and the Economic  Policy Institute and its EARN Network, SEIU, and Let Justice  Roll. In each state, the campaign was conducted by a broad-based  community-faith-labor coalition.</p>
