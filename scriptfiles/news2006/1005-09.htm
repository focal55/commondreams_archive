<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->WASHINGTON - October 5 - The Dow Jones  Industrial Average, adjusted for inflation, is down 17 percent  from its all-time high on Jan. 14, 2000. It would need to rise  another 2,378 points to set a new record, adjusted for inflation.  It is only when no adjustment is made for inflation that the Dow  can be said to have closed at a record high on Oct. 3, as has  been widely reported in the media.</p>
<p>   Measuring how the Dow has done relative to inflation is the  only meaningful way to assess its performance over time and what  it means for investors and the economy more broadly. To fail to  adjust for inflation and to say that the Dow has passed its  previous peak, is like saying that a worker whose wages are a  couple of cents an hour above where they were six or seven years  ago is better off today, even though the purchasing power of his  or her wages has fallen significantly. This is why, when the  Census Bureau reports on median household income each year, it  reports on median income adjusted for inflation.</p>
<p>   The broader stock market is even further below its 2000 peak.  The Dow Jones Wilshire 5000, which tracks more than 5,000 stocks  and is the most comprehensive measure of the U.S. Stock Market,  is 23 percent below its record close on March 24, 2000, after  adjusting for inflation. (Even without adjusting for inflation  the Wilshire 5000 is 9 percent below its March 24, 2000 peak.)</p>
<p>   Some of the value of the Dow when it hit its peak in 2000  undoubtedly was the result of an unsustainable bubble. And it is  good news that the Dow Jones Industrial Average, adjusted for  inflation, has risen at a 6 percent annual rate over the last  four years. (Note: a careful study by economists at the Federal  Reserve found no evidence this was caused by the dividend or  capital gains tax cuts enacted in 2003.) But simple statements  that the Dow is at an all-time high are more likely to create a  misleading impression than to enlighten people about the current  state of the stock market.</p>
