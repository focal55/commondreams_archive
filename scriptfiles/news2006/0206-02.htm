<p>WASHINGTON - February 6 - A coalition of over 100  organizations -- headquartered at  <a href="http://releases.usnewswire.com/redir.asp?ReleaseID=60523&Link=http://www.AfterDowningStreet.org">http://www.AfterDowningStreet.org</a> -- flooded the U.S. media with  e-mails, phone calls, faxes and protests last June until a leaked  British document known as the Downing Street Memo received  coverage.</p>
<p>   The same coalition has launched a campaign to demand coverage  of a memo recording a meeting at the White House on Jan. 31,  2003.</p>
<p>   The Downing Street Memo and seven other leaked documents made  clear that Bush had decided on war and decided to lie about WMDs  and ties to 9-11, that he was aware that Iraq was not a threat,  that no attempt was being made to avoid war, that the focus was  on selling the war to the public, and that Bush turned to the UN  in hopes of crafting an ultimatum that Saddam Hussein would  reject.</p>
<p>   Some of the most damning information in the memo came from a  report that Richard Dearlove, head of secret intelligence for the  UK, made on his recent trip to the United States.  Some in the  media resisted this information, on grounds that we did not know  whom Dearlove had met with.  James Risen's recently released book  &quot;State of War&quot; reports that Dearlove met with George Tenet at CIA  headquarters on July 20, 2002.  </p>
<p>   When President Bush and Prime Minister Blair were asked about  the Downing Street Memo last summer, they did not dispute its  authenticity or speak to most of its charges.  Their chief  response was that they had gone to the United Nations to try to  avoid war.</p>
<p>   But the new White House Memo reports that Bush told Blair &quot;The  U.S. would put its full weight behind efforts to get another (UN)  resolution and would 'twist arms' and 'even threaten'. But he had  to say that if ultimately we failed, military action would follow  anyway.''</p>
<p>   Jan. 31, 2003, was also the day that the NSA circulated an  internal top-secret memo planning spying on UN Security Council  members.</p>
<p>   The new memo shows that Bush was hoping to assassinate Saddam  Hussein, and that Bush was so desperate to provoke a war that he  even proposed painting US planes to look like UN planes and  flying them low over Iraq in hopes of getting shot at.</p>
