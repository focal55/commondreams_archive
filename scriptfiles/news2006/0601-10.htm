<p>U.S. Representative Lynn Woolsey has been outspoken leader in calling for the end of war in Iraq and in bringing the troops home.  In January 2005, Woolsey was the first member of Congress to introduce legislation calling for the President to develop a plan for bringing U.S. troops home from Iraq.  Then in May 2005, Woolsey led the first debate on the House floor and her amendment was the first bipartisan effort to end American military involvement in Iraq, receiving the votes of 128 Members of Congress, including 5 Republicans and 1 Independent.

<p>Rep. Lynn Woolsey has also requested official hearings in the U.S. House International Relations Committee and the U.S. House Armed Services Committee to discuss plans to bring U.S. troops home from Iraq.  Since her requests of the President and the Republican controlled Congress have been ignored, Woolsey has organized her own informal "hearings" to discuss strategies to achieve military disengagement while still playing a constructive role in the rebuilding of Iraqi society.
