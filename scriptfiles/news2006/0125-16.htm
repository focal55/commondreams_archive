<p>WASHINGTON - January 25 - Leaders of the 62-Member Congressional Progressive Caucus (CPC) will present an alternative, inclusive, and uplifting vision for the United States of America on the morning of the President's State of the Union address.  The Members will hold a news conference followed by discussion panels at the DNC to propose a new direction for the country and articulate concrete ideas for achieving change.  The meeting will feature several Progressive Caucus leaders discussing issues ranging from how to bring our troops home from Iraq to ending the Republican culture of corruption and cronyism to healthcare reform to rebuilding New Orleans and the Gulf Coast and achieving broad-based economic growth.

<p>“The Progressive Caucus has a bold, progressive vision for America," said Rep. Woolsey. "Our agenda speaks to hard working Americans who play by the rules and want a bright future for themselves and their families."  Rep. Woolsey is the co-Chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus.

<p>“We offer a fresh, vigorous alternative for the 21st century, and we’re going to present an unapologetic legislative alternative  that offers hope and a better quality of life for all Americans--- not just the powerful and privileged,” said U.S Representative Barbara Lee (D-CA), Co-Chair of the CPC.

<p>The Caucus’ 62 members include 10 who are in line to become Committee Chairs should the Democrats retake the House in November 2006, and 35 who would head up House Subcommittees.      

<p>The Progressive Caucus news conference and panel discussions will highlight progressive priorities and ideas embodied in a set of twenty articles published by the Members of the Caucus in a special issue of The Nation magazine: Paths to Renewal which is now available on newsstands across the country and at www.thenation.com.
