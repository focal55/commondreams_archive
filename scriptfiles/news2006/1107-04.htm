<p>WASHINGTON - November 7 - The AFL-CIO will hold a post-election briefing to release  unique Election Day polling of union members nationally and in  battleground states and to analyze the impact the union vote had  on the elections. AFL-CIO President John Sweeney, Political  Director Karen Ackerman and AFSCME President and AFL-CIO  Political Committee Chair Gerald McEntee will be joined by Geoff  Garin and Guy Molyneux of Peter D. Hart Research Associates for  the 12:30 briefing at the AFL-CIO headquarters on Wednesday, Nov.  8. Union activists from battleground states will also join the  press briefing.
<p>   The AFL-CIO GOTV program is the largest organizational turnout  program in the nation, focused on electing candidates who will  champion working families' priorities.</p>
<p>   The program reaches out to more than 13.4 million union voters  in 32 states and in 175 electoral races at all levels. </p>
<p>   The AFL-CIO identified 2.6 million drop-off voters in 2006,  contacting them as many as 25 times throughout the course of the  program. Overall, the AFL-CIO has made more than 10 million phone  calls and sent more than 11 million pieces of mail urging union  voters, including drop-off voters, to get to the polls on Nov. 7.  More than 100,000 volunteers are going door-to-door for the AFL- CIO's &quot;Final Four&quot; GOTV push in the final four days of the  election.  </p>
<p>   The AFL-CIO is also holding an election night watch party on  Tuesday, Nov. 7 starting at 8 p.m. at AFL-CIO headquarters  building.</p>
