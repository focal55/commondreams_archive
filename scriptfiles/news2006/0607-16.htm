AMSTERDAM - June 7 - As the kick-off to the football world cup 
approaches, Greenpeace has revealed the shocking fact that every four 
seconds, marine life in an area of ocean floor the size of ten football 
fields is wiped out by high seas bottom trawlers. Tomorrow has been 
designated World Oceans Day, but before it is over, a global fleet of 
around 300 high seas bottom trawlers will have dragged their heavy nets 
across an estimated 1,500 km2 of deep-seabed, destroying some of the 
most diverse, ancient and fragile ocean life on the planet.

<P>Today, volunteers highlighted the enormity of bottom-trawling by 
comparing the 100 metre nets actually used to a real sized football 
pitch in Haarlem, The Netherlands. In true football style volunteers 
raised their shirts and had S C O R E   4   O C E A N S spelt out on 
their stomachs as a message to governments of the world to take action 
to protect the ocean today and for future generations. Shirts were worn 
from the different nations of the world who have either opposed 
high-seas bottom trawling or support this devastating fishing practice.

<P>"If this was happening on land, there would be an international outcry. 
It's a question of out of sight, out of mind with the destruction of 
these beautiful ancient undersea worlds - and all for just a few fish." 
(1) Said Sari Tolvanen Greenpeace Oceans campaigner.  "Huge bottom trawl 
nets are dragged along the seabed, smashing ancient corals and 
destroying the other marine life which makes up these fragile deep-sea 
communities that have taken thousands of years to develop," she continued.

<P>The deep-sea is believed to contain the largest pool of undiscovered 
life on earth. Scientists estimate that 500,000 to 100 million species 
exist in the deep-sea. Greenpeace is part of a global coalition of NGOs, 
over 1500 scientists and an increasing number of states which are 
calling for a United Nations global moratorium on high seas bottom 
trawling due to the threat that this destructive fishing activity poses 
to deep-sea life.

<P>"A moratorium on high seas bottom trawling would allow the necessary 
'time out' for scientists to assess the extent and nature of deep-sea 
biodiversity and policy makers to develop legally binding mechanisms for 
the protection, sustainable use and management of international waters. 
The moratorium would be a step towards one of the key solutions to the 
range of threats our oceans are facing" said Karen Sack, Greenpeace 
International Oceans Policy Advisor.

<P>"Unless high seas bottom trawling is halted now, the entire area of 
vulnerable deep-sea corals will have been trawled at least once within 
the next 16 years - that's in just four World Cup's time", said Sari 
Tolvanen.

<P>The job is large but not insurmountable. Next week, world governments 
gather in New York once again to discuss issues related to the 
protection of deep-sea biodiversity where progress on the high seas 
issues can be achieved. (2)

<P>Greenpeace's campaign for a UN moratorium on high seas bottom trawling 
is part of the most ambitious ship expedition ever undertaken by the 
environmental advocacy organisation. The 14-month long "Defending our 
Oceans" expedition is exposing the key threats to our oceans and 
offering real solutions, a global network of properly enforced marine 
reserves covering 40 percent of the worlds oceans: places that will be 
protected from industrial exploitation and destruction, from industrial 
fishing and hunting, and places from which our oceans can begin the 
process of repair and recovery.

<P>Greenpeace is an independent campaigning organisation that uses 
non-violent creative confrontation to expose global environmental 
problems to drive solutions that are essential to a green and peaceful 
future.

<P>(1) At present there are about 250-300 high seas bottom trawling fishing 
boats and many of these are not full time. This is only 0.3 percent of 
the three million commercial fishing boats worldwide, and only 0.2 
percent of global marine fisheries production. The overall contribution 
of high seas bottom trawling to global food security is negligible.
