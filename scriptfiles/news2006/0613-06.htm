<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON - June 13 - U.S. specialists are currently awaiting
              the White House&#8217;s
            next drug certification report, which is normally released in September,
            to see whether the Bush Administration will continue to use the document
            as a political tool rather than a piece of objective research.
            In the summer of 2005, Venezuelan officials suspended collaboration
            with the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) over Caracas&#8217; allegations
            that the U.S. agency had engaged in spying. In response, Washington
            decertified Venezuela as a cooperative anti-narcotics partner, and
            labeled it as one of two countries worldwide which &#8220;failed
            demonstrably to make substantial efforts&#8221; in the anti-drug
            campaign. However, the decision to blacklist Venezuela in the &#8220;war
            on drugs&#8221; was an unalloyed hoax. The Bush Administration&#8217;s
            accusation that Venezuela had failed to implement anti-drug measures
            drawn up by U.S. policymakers did Caracas an injustice. It was a
            judgment inspired more by political differences rather than a genuine
            critique based on legitimate drug-trafficking issues. In fact, the
            administration&#8217;s finding was little more than Washington sensing
            an opening to take another jab at Ch&aacute;vez&#8217;s Venezuela
            for its insolent attitude. This is not surprising considering that
            the decertification process is so self-serving and political that
            it is held in low esteem worldwide because of its lack of transparency
            and its indifference to evidence which challenges the White House&#8217;s
          simplistic verdict against the leftist regime.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
              <strong>Contrived Charges</strong><br>
            Washington&#8217;s decision to decertify Venezuela was a calumnious
            attempt to use ostensibly non-political means to achieve ideological
            ends. Since the drug certification process is ultimately a presidential
            endeavor, there is every reason to believe that the legitimate facts
            of the matter were never included in the decision, considering President
            Bush has pegged his Venezuelan counterpart as, aside from Castro,
            his number one hemispheric foe. According to acting Assistant Secretary
            of State for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs,
            Ambassador Nancy Powell, &#8220;the [U.S.] President determined that
            the Government of Venezuela had not addressed the increasing use
            of Venezuelan territory to transport drugs to the United States.&#8221; But
            her claim merely transposed the responsibility for making the accusation
            to the U.S. president, and did not definitively authenticate Venezuela&#8217;s
            role in the drug trade. Indeed, there is ample evidence that Venezuelan
            President Ch&aacute;vez has been as vigilant over this issue as any
            of the &#8220;partner&#8221; nations supposedly cooperating with
            Washington.</font></p>

          <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The allegations against Caracas are
              all the more slanderous when laid next to other official U.S. compilations
              of
              data. Statistics
            provided by the U.S. International Narcotics Control Strategy Reports
            (INCSR) in 2005 gave positive marks for Venezuela&#8217;s anti-narcotics
            efforts. These accolades are even more impressive considering that
            Venezuela&#8217;s neighbor, Colombia, represents the world&#8217;s
            largest cocaine producer in the world. Such difficulties notwithstanding,
            the Ch&aacute;vez administration actively takes steps to interdict
            drug supplies, to destroy drug production sites, and to formulate
            agreements with other regional countries to combat drug trafficking. </font></p>
          <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
              <strong>Geographically Cursed</strong><br>
            Even if stringent border controls or more transparent security
            were in place, geography has damned Venezuela to an inevitable
            role as
          one of the transshipment points since its border with Colombia
            is almost impossible to control. As Jesse Chac&oacute;n, Venezuela&#8217;s
              Minister of Interior and Justice, stated &#8220;We are neither major
              producers nor major consumers, but our geographic position makes
              us a country of transit.&#8221; In early 2006, a drug bust in Mexico
              served to confirm Venezuela&#8217;s unfortunate reality about its
              relatively peripheral role in the international drug trade. On April
              5, 2006 a DC-9 twin engine jet originating from Caracas landed in
              Ciudad del Carmen, Mexico, carrying 5.5 tons of cocaine with a worth
              of about $100 million in street value. Operating on tips from U.S.
              and Venezuelan authorities, the Mexican army was awaiting the plane&#8217;s
              arrival in order to conduct an inspection. Although a few airport
              officials tried to block the search of the plane with fraudulent
              allegations of a potentially explosive oil leak on the plane, authorities
              were able to seize the aircraft&#8217;s illicit cargo. Although the
              pilot of the plane managed to escape, officials took into custody
              the co-pilot and some suspect airport personnel. </font></p>

          <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Efforts against the Drug Trade</strong><br>
Over the past few years, Venezuelan authorities have been increasingly
              successful in intercepting drug shipments. The 2005 INSCR report
              supports these findings, with statistics from 1998 to 2004 indicating
              that over that period seizures rose from 8.6 tons to 19.07 tons.
              According to Venezuelan government sources, 58.5 tons of cocaine,
              18.3 tons of marijuana, 869 pounds of heroine and 766.7 pounds
              of crack were intercepted in 2005, which representing an 87% increase
              from the previous year &#8211; hardly the mark of a lackadaisical
              or uncooperative anti-narcotics effort.</font></p>
          <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 2004, the Venezuelan government&#8217;s arrests and seizures
            led to the disruption of two major drug trafficking operations: the
            Hasbun and Luis Alberto Ibarra cartels. The Hasbun group was responsible
            for multi-ton cocaine shipments to the U.S. via Venezuela and Mexico.
            Under the leadership of the Venezuelan Prosecutors Drug Task Force
            (PDTF), twenty-four traffickers were captured and seven of the group
            were killed in the course of numerous raids which led to the confiscation
            of about six metric tons of cocaine. The Luis Alberto Ibarra cartel
            was also subjected to heavy pressure from Venezuelan authorities.
            According to the INCSR, the PDTF coordinated an investigation that
            involved the collection of evidence, obtainment of controlled delivery
            orders, overall surveillance, and arrests of members of the organization
            who provided testimony against Ibarra. The investigations ultimately
            led to his arrest and extradition, with a U.S. court eventually sentencing
            him to 21 years in a U.S. prison. A State Department report notes
            that David Kelley, U.S. Southern District judge of New York &#8220;&#8230;praised
            the cooperation between several U.S. enforcement agencies and Venezuelan
            judicial police in investigating the case.&#8221; The report notes
            the additional arrests of 17 members of Ibarra&#8217;s criminal organization,
            underlining Venezuela&#8217;s achievements in the war against organized
            crime. </font></p>

          <p></p>
          <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>A Multi-Front Struggle</strong><br>
Moreover, the Venezuelan government recently implemented legislation
              aiding in the fight against drug trafficking and domestic drug
              consumption. In 2005, Venezuela passed the Organic Law Against
              Illicit Traffic and Consumption of Drugs and Psychotropic Substances,
              as well as the Organic Law Against Organized Crime. These laws
              stipulated that those who traffic and harbor drugs and illegal
              chemical substances will be subject to six to eight years in prison.
              The punishment will be increased if the offender is a government
              official, a member of the National Guard, a judicial authority,
              or anyone who impersonates such individuals. In addition, Venezuela&#8217;s
              National Commission Against the Illegal Use of Drugs (CONACUID)
              was renamed to the National Anti-Drug Office (ONA) and given financial,
              administrative, and functional autonomy as a co-participant in
              the effort. Whether these laws will be consistently applied remains
              an open question. Nonetheless, the legal foundation now exists
to aid authorities in their fight against drug trafficking.</font></p>
          <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>International Cooperation</strong><br>
Furthermore, Venezuela has promoted multilateral cooperation in the
              war against drugs, agreeing in 2005 to various treaties involving
              anti-narcotics operations. During that year Venezuela signed an
              accord with France and Spain to process satellite images that detect
              illegal airstrips and airplanes carrying drugs. Also, the Spanish
              government agreed to sell twelve aircraft, eight patrol boats,
              and two maritime patrolling aircraft to Venezuela for use in the
              anti-narcotics efforts, against much U.S. opposition. Washington
              actively sought to block the sale, despite Ch&aacute;vez&#8217;s
              assertions that the equipment would be used to survey areas and
              interrupt any drug-related activity. Furthermore, in 2005 Colombia
              and Venezuela signed a pact which pledged to create greater cooperation
              between the two countries&#8217; authorities and develop more effective
              enforcement mechanisms against drug trafficking. In 2006, foreign
              officials from Britain, the Netherlands, and Spain congratulated
              Caracas for successfully challenging drug smuggling operations.
              According to the <em>Xinhua</em> news service, Holland&#8217;s Elsa de Costa
              commended Luis Correa, head of the ONA, for &#8220;&#8230;his collaboration
              in ways that are both opportune, efficient and optimal, in everything
              related to the joint anti-drug fight.&#8221;</font></p>

          <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Challenges Ahead</strong><br>
Prospects of corruption &#8212; much of it inherited by Ch&aacute;vez &#8212; clearly
            poses a test for Venezuela&#8217;s crackdown on the drug flow. Personnel
            at the Maiquetia International Airport are reported to have witnessed
            numerous incidences of corruption amongst employees. The <em>Miami
            Herald </em>states that up to an estimated $2 million in bribes are paid monthly
            by drug traffickers to airport officials, as well as some members
            of the National Guard and the police. Other techniques, such as using
            passengers or couriers to transport drug cargo, are also employed
            by the cartels. Venezuelan authorities will need to pay closer attention
            to such activities and introduce new measures in order to effectively
            end these practices. </font></p>
          <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Even so, there have been convincing
              steps taken by Venezuela against corruption. Earlier this year,
              60 anti-drug officers
              were fired after
            charges of mishandling or losing confiscated drug supplies. Luis
            Correa, head of ONA, reported that &#8220;they ordered a complete
            cleanup of the CICP anti-drug squad; that means the removal from
            the director to the last officer,&#8221; indicating that Venezuelan
            officials are highly motivated to target long-practiced corrupt procedures
            in law enforcement.</font></p>

          <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Misleading Claims</strong><br>
The Venezuelan government has clearly undertaken comprehensive steps
              to combat drug trafficking through domestic operations as well
              as multilateral efforts. These moves must be maintained and improved
              upon in order to continue interrupting drug flows primarily originating
              from Colombia. Simply putting the blame on Venezuela&#8217;s inherited
              weak and often venal judicial system will not suffice. Ch&aacute;vez
              has moved aggressively to deal with the narcotics problem, and
              even official U.S. statistics indicate this. The claim that Venezuela
              is any less cooperative or vigilant in its anti-drug efforts than
              other area nations which were not decertified is nothing more than
              a tendentious invention. The long list of investigations, arrests
              and legislation which have been undertaken by the Ch&aacute;vez
              government are not suggestive of a country that is failing &#8220;to
              meet international treaty obligations.&#8221; The incontrovertible
              conclusion is that without any justification, Washington deliberately
              discredits Venezuela&#8217;s anti-drug efforts, defaming a nation
              whose major <em>pecado</em> is its laxity in the war on drugs, but rather
              its willingness to defy the will of Uncle Sam on repeated occasions
              over the issue of not so much drugs or terrorism or human trafficking,
              but of sovereignty.<br>
