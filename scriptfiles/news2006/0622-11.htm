EGYPT - June 22 -  The bluefin tuna population in the Mediterranean Sea may be on the brink of collapse and the fishery must be closed immediately, said Greenpeace today. The organisation's ship Esperanza, in the Mediterranean on the 4th leg of its fourteen-month Defending Our Oceans expedition, (1) has spent the past month documenting and exposing the disastrous management of the fishery.
   </p>
<br>
<br>
    <div class="body">    
      During this time the Esperanza has been to some of the main tuna
fishing grounds in the region, including the Balearic Islands and the
waters north of Egypt and south of Turkey. Greenpeace has documented
the activity of some of the most important fishing fleets in the
Mediterranean (2) and spoken with the captains of these vessels. All
the evidence confirms the desperate state of the fishery in the whole
region.<br>
<br>
"A month ago we asked the question: Where have all the tuna gone? Well,
now we know the answer - we may be witnessing the collapse of the
bluefin tuna stock from the Mediterranean Sea," said Sebastián Losada
of Greenpeace Spain aboard the Esperanza. "Massive overfishing over the
past decade by greedy companies has brought about this crisis, and the
International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas
(ICCAT), <br>
charged with regulating the industry, has proved to be completely unable to enforce the rules".<br>
<br>
In May, Greenpeace published a report (3) which drew the world's
attention to the serious depletion of bluefin tuna in the Mediterranean
Sea and demonstrating that up to 45,000 tonnes of tuna may have been
caught each year in 2004 and 2005, despite the fact that only 32,000
tonnes can be caught legally. During the past month the fishermen
Greenpeace has spoken to admitted that quotas are not respected and
that there is no effective control over the fishery.<br>
<br>
Greenpeace is calling on the countries of the Mediterranean to protect
bluefin tuna with marine reserves in their breeding and feeding areas.
They would become part of a global network of marine parks across 40%
of the world's oceans that are needed to give the oceans a chance to
recover from decades of large-scale industrial exploitation.<br>
<br>
"It is indisputable that neither Governments nor ICCAT are in a
position to enforce fisheries regulations in the region and that, as
the evidence indicates, bluefin tuna may be on the brink of collapse",
said Sebastián Losada. "The fishery should be closed until new
management measures that guarantee the future of the fishery are put in
place (4) - otherwise it will be finished for good."<br>
<br>
Other evidence of the mismanagement of the fishery documented by
Greenpeace includes Japanese longliners fishing south of Sicily in the
month of June, when longline fishing for bluefin tuna is prohibited,
and the transhipment of catches at sea which provides an open door for
illegal catches to reach the market without being properly controlled.

<br>
"The situation is cause for grave concern wherever we've been to. The
Esperanza spent a week with the French and Spanish fleets and they
didn't find a single bluefin tuna. The Turkish fleet is concerned about
the declining size of the fish they catch, and they have only been
fishing this area for five years". Said François Provost of Greenpeace
France. "Sadly it seems the fishing industry has learnt nothing from
the collapse of cod or the western population of bluefin tuna - they
are simply repeating past mistakes in a rush to catch the last fish,"
Provost concluded.<br>
<br>
Greenpeace is an independent campaigning organisation that uses
non-violent creative confrontation to expose global environmental
problems to drive solutions that are essential to a green and peaceful
future.<br>

  <p><b>Notes to Editor</b></p>
<p class="notes-to-editor">(1) The Greenpeace ship Esperanza is currently on a 14-month global expedition 'Defending Our Oceans', the most ambitious ship expedition ever undertaken by the organisation. The expedition has so far exposed the threats to the oceans such as whaling in the Southern Ocean and pirate fishing in West Africa, and documented the beauty of deep-sea habitats around the Azores.</p>
<p>(2) The Esperanza has documented the activities of the French, Spanish and Turkish tuna fleets, as well as towing operations between Libya and Italy, and tuna cages in Cyprus.</p>

Executive summary at: <a href="http://oceans.greenpeace.org/tuna-summary/">http://oceans.greenpeace.org/tuna-summary/</a></p>
<p>(4) Greenpeace demands to ICCAT, before the fishery can be safely reopened:</p>
<p>- Marine reserves to protect the breeding and feeding grounds of bluefin tuna<br />
- A recovery program that includes a substantial reduction in the bluefin tuna quota, and marine reserves to protect the breeding grounds of the species<br />
- A minimum landing size that matches the sexual maturity of the species<br />
- An extension of the seasonal closure of the fishery to guarantee a strong, immediate and enforceable decrease in the fishing effort<br />
- Independent observers on tuna fishing vessels and in tuna farms to record and report the catch to ensure that under-sized fish are not caught and the quota is not exceeded, and provide the information needed to sustainably manage the fishery.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0px;">(5) The Greenpeace ship Rainbow Warrior documented the activity of eight to nine Japanese longliners operating south of Sicily (around 32 º 35.34 N, 29º 48.89 E) on 6 June 2006. On 17 June 2006 the Greenpeace ship Esperanza found the ex-longliner "206 Melissa", flagged to Guinea Conakry, in position 36º 12.67 N, 31º 41.67 E - south of Turkey. The crew of the vessel declared that they were operating as a reefer, receiving bluefin tuna from fishing vessels in the area.</p>
