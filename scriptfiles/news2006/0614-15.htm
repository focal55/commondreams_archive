<p>WASHINGTON - June 14 - Democracy Rising will have its troops in front of the White House 
beginning Thursday June 15, 2006 at 1 p.m. distributing free of charge 
thousands of copies of the book Cruel and Unusual: Bush/Cheney's New 
World Order (Norton, 2004) by Mark Crispin Miller.

<p>"Hundreds of people come from all points of the globe to Washington, 
D.C. every day to see the White House," said Democracy Rising's 
executive director Kevin Zeese. "While they are outside the gates 
looking in at the building, we'll give them a little going away present. 
This book lets them have a peek as to what's going on inside the White 
House."

<p>Zeese said that he learned earlier this year that the book was about to 
be pulped - so his group picked up a tractor trailer load for a fraction 
of the cover price.

<p>"This book portrays President Bush as the lawless militarist that he 
is," Zeese said. "It will be our pleasure to distribute it to people 
from around the world wondering what is going on inside the White House."

<p>Zeese said that volunteers will be distributing the book on the sidewalk 
in front of the White House to passers by.

<p>"I figure that we can give away a couple of hundred a day," Zeese said. 
"We should get them distributed by the end of the summer."
