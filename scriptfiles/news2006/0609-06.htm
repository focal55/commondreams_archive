<p>WASHINGTON - June 9 - “We applaud Senators for rejecting another attempt by some of their colleagues to repeal the estate tax. Such a move would have benefited less than one percent of the population and jeopardized the services that millions of Americans rely on.

<p>“If tax breaks for the wealthy had passed, average Americans would have had to foot the bill through cuts in education, health care and services for the elderly.

<p>“Hopefully lawmakers in Washington will return to focusing on finding solutions to the real problems facing working families in America— record high gas prices, the war in Iraq, and skyrocketing health care costs—instead of spending their time giving multimillionaires the ultimate tax windfall.
