<p>NEW YORK - October 27  - The congressional vote which today 
eliminated all exceptions to the general penalization of abortion in 
Nicaragua constitutes a direct threat to human rights, said Human Rights 
Watch. The new penal code penalizes abortion even when it is carried out 
to save the pregnant woman's life, or when the pregnancy is the result of 
rape or incest. 

<p>"The new penal code doesn't just go against basic human rights: it goes 
against fundamental principles of humanity," said José Miguel Vivanco, 
director of Human Rights Watch's Americas Division. "Human Rights 
Watch knows from experience what it generally means to be pregnant as 
the result of rape, or to have an unsafe abortion: misery, desperation, and 
even the death of the pregnant woman."

<p>The reform has been criticized by international institutions, including 
United Nations agencies, for taking place in a politicized environment, 
since the vote happened on the eve of the presidential elections in 
Nicaragua, scheduled for November 5.  

<p>"Women shouldn't go to prison for having abortions, it's that simple.  And 
even less should they have to risk their lives because of complications 
during pregnancy", dijo Vivanco. "But instead of protecting the rights of 
the citizens they represent, the political parties have used women's bodies 
as electoral battle ground."
