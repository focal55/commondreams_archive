<p>WASHINGTON - January 23 - The unusual depositions of four men suing the U.S. government for unlawful imprisonment and abuse in the wake of the September 11 attacks began this morning, according to their attorneys at the Center for Constitutional Rights.  CCR’s class action, Turkmen v. Ashcroft, was filed in September 2002 to challenge the arbitrary detention and mistreatment of immigration detainees by prison guards and high level Bush Administration officials.  With no evidence of any connection to terrorism, hundreds of Arab and South Asian Muslim men were rounded up on the basis of racial and religious profiling and subject to unlawful detention and abuse at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, NY.  All of the men were eventually deported, but after long and complicated negotiations, four of the plaintiffs have returned under strict conditions to participate in their case against the government. The depositions will take place over the next two weeks in New York City.  Further depositions of both plaintiffs and defendants will take place in the coming months.

 

<p>In the Turkmen suit, CCR challenges the unconstitutional detention of non-citizens arrested on civil immigration charges but held for investigation into potential ties to terrorism long after their immigration issues were resolved and until they could be cleared of any connection to terrorism.  The suit describes the inhumane and degrading treatment they suffered, including solitary confinement, a complete blackout on communication with their families and attorneys, excessive strip searches, severe beatings by guards, incessant verbal abuse, and deliberate interference with their religious practices.  

 

<p>The four men, Yasser Ebrahim, Asif-ur-Rehman Saffi, Hany Ibrahim and Ashraf Ibrahim, will be barred from speaking to anyone outside of the case while they are here, including family members and friends in the U.S and the content of their .  They will be deposed by attorneys from the Department of Justice, and attorneys for the individual defendants named in the suit.  

 

<p>Despite the fact that the allegations of inhumane and degrading treatment have been substantiated by two reports of the Justice Department’s Office of the Inspector General, discipline has been slow in coming from the Federal Bureau of Prisons.  Department of Justice Inspector General Glenn Fine, testifying before Congress in June 2005, criticized the long delay and urged expeditious and appropriate action in disciplining at least 10 of those responsible.  Today, the Center for Constitutional Rights welcomed news that disciplinary actions had finally been taken by the Bureau of Prisons:  so far, in December 2005 and January 2006, five men from the Metropolitan Detention Center (MDC) have been disciplined for their role in the abuse:   two were terminated, two were suspended for 30 days, and one was demoted.  More actions may be pending.

 

<p>CCR Legal Director Bill Goodman said, “Our clients have returned to the U.S. to fight for justice.  They were deprived of their rights and abused simply because of their ethnicity and religion, and we at the Center for Constitutional Rights are determined to challenge the unlawful actions of those responsible.  Former Attorney General Ashcroft and FBI Director Robert Mueller were among the architects of the plan to deprive these individuals of their rights, and we plan to hold them accountable in this lawsuit.”  

 

<p>CCR attorney Rachel Meeropol said, “To our knowledge, there has never before been a case where immigrants who had been deported were allowed to return to the country to participate in a lawsuit, and we look forward to using their time here to strengthen our case against defendants.”

 

<p>“While the three-year delay in taking disciplinary action remains a major concern, we commend the Bureau of Prisons for finally disciplining some of the guards who participated in this outrageous abuse,” said CCR attorney Matthew Strugar. “It means a lot to our clients that finally someone is being held accountable for the brutality they experienced, but we believe the responsibility for these abuses goes further up the chain of command at the Bureau of Prisons and we are disappointed more individuals have not yet been held accountable.  ”
