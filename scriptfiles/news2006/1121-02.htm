<p>NEW YORK - November 21 - Concerned citizens from  over 150 countries have supported a campaign to run newspaper ads  in the United States and United Kingdom today calling for a new  strategy for Iraq, including a U.N.-led international peace  conference. The effort is organized by CeasefireCampaign.org, an  online activist network of 340,000 citizens that rose up to  demand a ceasefire in the conflict in Lebanon last July.  </p>
<p>   "People around the world agree that the solution in Iraq must  be political, not military, and genuinely international, not  unilateral," said Ricken Patel, the director of  CeasefireCampaign.org. "It's time that the U.S. finally passed  the diplomatic steering wheel to a more legitimate and impartial  international mediator, like the United Nations."</p>
<p>   The ad calls for a "N.E.W." plan for Iraq: (1) Negotiate with  all Iraqi factions and neighbors; (2) Empower the international  community to lead negotiations; and (3) Withdraw responsibly,  according to the wishes of the Iraqi people.   </p>

<p>   "The recent elections showed us that we stand with the  American people in our desire to see a fundamentally new  direction in Iraq," said Patel. "When both the U.S. and the  current Iraqi government lack the legitimacy to act as an honest  broker, the international community must fill that void."   </p>
<p>   The first ads will be full page and quarter page ads run in  U.S. and U.K. newspapers on Tuesday, Nov. 21. The ad can be seen  at <a href="http://releases.usnewswire.com/redir.asp?ReleaseID=76648&Link=http://www.CeasefireCampaign.org">http://www.CeasefireCampaign.org</a>. </p>
