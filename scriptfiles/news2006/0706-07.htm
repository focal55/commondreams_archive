<p>ASPEN, Colorado   - July 6 - 

With Americans having just celebrated their nation's independence, a new survey conducted by Dr. Douglas E. Schoen finds that a majority of Americans say they are not living the American Dream. Dr. Schoen's findings were presented at the Aspen Ideas Festival, a weeklong exploration of ideas across an array of timely topics that is being co-presented by the Aspen Institute and The Atlantic magazine.

<p>Some of the key findings of the survey are as follows:

<p>-- While 81 percent agree that America is the land of opportunity, the idea is not something that is being realized, it is simply an abstract concept.

<p>-- Today, 61 percent of Americans say they are not living the American Dream.

<p>-- 61 percent of Americans who aren't living the Dream say they do not believe that they will ever reach the American Dream in their lifetime.

<p>-- 75 percent say the American Dream is somewhat broken, with just 1 in 4 saying it is "alive and well" today.

<p>-- 9 in 10 agree that it is harder to achieve the American Dream than ever before.

<p>-- In addition, just 49 percent agree that if you work hard and play by the rules, you can lead a solid middle class life. 51 percent of Americans disagree with that statement.
<p>
"The rising costs of healthcare, the unaffordability of a college education and the need to self finance your retirement leaves most Americans today caught in an affordability crisis", said Dr. Douglas E. Schoen, the author of the study. "Americans from all income groups are simply saying life as we know it, has become unaffordable and that the promise of achieving the American Dream is simply out of reach for too many people."

<p>-- While 90 percent of voters believe that 25 years ago you could have a solid middle class life if you worked hard and played by the rules -- only 49 percent believe the same is true today suggesting our country's Social Compact is now fundamentally broken and in need of substantial repair.

<p>Unfortunately the consensus among the public is that neither political party, Democrats or Republicans are seen as able to address this crisis.

<p>-- 77 percent agree that America's political system has failed to provide answers at a time when Americans are increasingly alarmed about how technology is reshaping their lives.

<p>-- 72 percent agree that today the world has changed, but our political parties have not.

<p>Dr. Schoen's survey also included questions about what kind of policy prescriptions people are looking for today.

<p>What is clear after 6 years of Republican rule in both the White House and Congress is that there is no desire to move the country to the left -- or the right -- the country desires centrist policies.

<p>-- First there is no appetite for policies of wealth redistribution.

<p>-- 74 percent say that government should pursue policies that grow the economy, compared with just 26 percent who say that government should pursue policies that redistribute wealth from the richest to the middle class and poorest.

<p>-- There is however strong support for the Government supporting traditional institutions.

<p>-- 63 percent believe government has a constructive role to play in supporting institutions like the church, marriage, and family.

<p>The country also desires policies that will unite the country so we can address real problems we face.

<p>-- 95 percent agree with the statement; Our country is strongest when it is united and together and therefore we need to find common solutions to our problems that both Democrats and Republicans agree with.

<p>-- 80 percent agree with the statement that working together, America can address all the problems we face.

<p>Dr. Schoen, a Democratic Party strategist said that although his data analysis concluded that neither political party was adequately addressing this affordability crisis today, the party that offered the most tangible solution to this crisis would benefit enormously on Election Day.

<p>Dr. Schoen's survey was commissioned by the Aspen Institute's annual Ideas Festival which is being held today through July 9 in Aspen, Colo. The survey; designed, developed, and analyzed by Dr. Schoen was conducted among 1,200 American voters and has an overall margin of error of plus/minus 1.44 percent.

<p>Dr. Schoen, a pollster of more than 30 years, has worked for a range of office holders including former President Bill Clinton, New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg, Indiana Senator Evan Bayh, and New Jersey Governor Jon Corzine.

<p>Dr. Schoen is available for comment all day Thursday, July 6.
<p> Dr. Schoen can be reached at 646-206-5955 or you can contact his associate Bradley Honan at 917-576-0981 to arrange an interview.<!-- #EndEditable -->
