<p>PHILADELPHIA - March 16 - Recognizing the tremendous toll taken by more than three years of war, the American Friends Service Committee (AFSC), together with organizations representing military families and veterans opposing the war in Iraq, bring Eyes Wide Open: The Human Cost of War to the National Mall in Washington, D.C. over Mother’s Day weekend,  May 11 -14. 

 

<p>Combat boots that represent each U.S. military casualty in the Iraq war will be on display on the National Mall, in the shadow of the Washington Monument and U.S. Capitol.   Scores will join a silent procession – solemnly marching to mourn the many thousands of lives lost in the Iraq war.  After the procession, Iraq war veterans and survivors of previous wars share personal stories of life after the battlefield. Families recognize fallen loved ones and those still in harm’s way.  A special tribute to the estimated 100,000 Iraqi civilians who have died reminds us of a story not often told – the effects of war on the men, women and children of Iraq.   

<p>While the Pentagon keeps no official tally of civilian deaths, the war’s impact on the Iraqi people is tragic and real.  In this country, families also struggle to make sense of the death and destruction of lives. 

<p><b>WHAT: </b>Eyes Wide Open: The Human Cost of War, a war casualties exhibition featuring a pair of combat boots for each of the U.S. military lives lost in Iraq — more than 2,300 to date — along          with shoes that represent a small fraction of Iraqi civilians who have died. The names of Iraqi civilians and U.S. service personnel killed in the war will be read daily.<br>


                Silence of the Dead, Voices of the Living. Silent march and procession featuring military families, veterans and others who have borne the tragic human cost of the Iraq war 
          

<p><b>WHEN: </b>May 11 – 14 

<p><b>WHERE: </b>National Mall, Washington, D.C.

<p><b>WHY:</b>            To call on Congress to end the war and bring our troops home now
