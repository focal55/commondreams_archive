<p>WASHINGTON - June 28 - Despite multiple  headlines in October 2005 which read "Wal-Mart Urges Congress to  Raise the Minimum Wage," Wal-Mart announced today it does not  support raising the minimum wage to $7.25 an hour, according to  WakeUpWalMart.com.</p>
<p>   According to an article in this morning's Roll Call, Lee  Culpepper said Wal-Mart CEO Lee Scott's statement was  "misinterpreted," and that "Scott was not calling for Congress to  raise the minimum wage."</p>
<p>   "Wal-Mart's flip flop on the minimum wage is a cynical about- face which hurts America's working families," said Paul Blank,  campaign director for WakeUpWalMart.com. "This is hypocrisy at  its worst and the American people are the ones that will pay the  price," continued Blank.</p>
<p>   In this morning's article, Culpepper insisted, "I think what  he (Mr. Scott) said was clear." Culpepper is right. Scott's  statement was clear, WakeUpWalMart.com says. He said the minimum  wage was "out of date with the times" and therefore should be  raised.</p>

<p>   Here is what Scott said in October 2005: "The U.S. minimum  wage of $5.15 an hour has not been raised in nearly a decade and  we believe it is out of date with the times ... while it is  unusual for us to take a public position on a public policy issue  of this kind, we simply believe it is time for Congress to take a  responsible look at the minimum wage and other legislation that  may help working families."</p>
<p>   Blank continued, "Wal-Mart's flip-flop proves the company's  publicity stunts are nothing more than a sham. Wal-Mart will say  anything, even lie about its position on the minimum wage, in  order to try and salvage its declining public image."</p>
