<p>WASHINGTON - November 29 - Are the <span class="media_outlet">Washington Post</span>'s editorial pages entitled to not just their own opinions, but also their own facts? This seems to be the case with the paper's commentary on Venezuelan president Hugo Chavez, where editors and columnists have shown a disturbing pattern of inaccuracy and unaccountability. <br />
 <br />
In a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/11/23/AR2006112300966.html" title="">November 24 column</a>, Charles Krauthammer used a deceptively edited phrase in order to portray a Chavez speech as anti-Semitic. After chiding actor Sacha Baron Cohen for using his film "Borat" to go after small-time anti-Semitism in the United States, Krauthammer listed what he saw as more menacing instances of anti-Semitism, including:<br />
 <br />
<div class="sideindent">In Venezuela, Hugo Chavez says that the "descendants of the same ones that crucified Christ" have "taken possession of all the wealth in the world."</div><br />
 <br />
The idea that Chavez was making an anti-Semitic slur was debunked when these quotes first circulated. (See FAIR Action Alert, "<a href="index.php?page=2805" title="">Editing Chavez to Manufacture a Slur</a>," 1/23/06.)  As FAIR pointed out, Chavez's speech referred collectively to "the descendents of those who crucified Christ, the descendents of those who expelled Bolivar from here" as one and the same, saying they represented the "less than 10 percent of the world population [who] own more than half of the riches of the world." Chavez was clearly referring generically to the wealthy and powerful; by Krauthammer's reading one would have to conclude that Chavez thinks Jews persecuted Simon Bolivar and account for more than 600 million of the world's population. <br />
 <br />
As American Rabbi Arthur Waskow told the <span class="media_outlet">Associated Press</span> (1/5/06), "I know of no one who accuses the Jews of fighting against Bolivar." FAIR's alert noted that Jewish groups in Venezuela rejected the anti-Semitic reading of Chavez's speech. A letter sent by the Confederation of Jewish Associations of Venezuela to the Simon Wiesenthal Center (<span class="media_outlet">AP</span>, 1/14/06), a U.S. group promoting the deceptively edited quote, stated: "We believe the president was not talking about Jews," adding, "you have acted on your own, without consulting us, on issues that you don't know or understand." The American Jewish Committee and the American Jewish Congress agreed with the Venezuelan group's view that Chavez was not referring to Jews in his speech (<span class="media_outlet">Inter Press Service</span>, 1/13/06).   <br />
 <br />
But is Krauthammer's smear part of a larger pattern at the <span class="media_outlet">Post</span>? In April, <span class="media_outlet">Post</span> deputy editorial page editor Jackson Diehl wrote (4/10/06) that Chavez "has never enjoyed overwhelming support in Venezuela," adding, "his ratings have mostly fluctuated a few points above and below 50 percent."<br />
 <br />
As FAIR explained in a letter to Diehl asking for his documentation ("<a href="index.php?page=2876" title="">Ignoring Inaccuracy at the <span class="media_outlet">Washington Post</span></a>," 5/2/06), Chavez has won three elections with totals ranging from 56 to 60 percent of the popular vote, and opinion polls registered support for Chavez from 68 to 71 percent&#8212;as reported in Diehl's own paper (12/5/05). <br />
 <br />
FAIR's reasoned letter never received a response, which raises a question about accountability at the <span class="media_outlet">Post</span>'s editorial pages.<br />
