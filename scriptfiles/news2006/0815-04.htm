<p>WASHINGTON - August 15 - A Government  Accountability Office (GAO) report released today finds that the  U.S. government's efforts to combat human trafficking need: (1) a  coordinated strategy to combat trafficking in persons abroad; (2)  established performance measures or conducted evaluations of U.S.  programs to combat human trafficking in foreign countries; (3)  improved estimates of the number of trafficking victims or better  analysis of human trafficking-related data that already resides  within government agencies; and (4) more narrative to explain why  the specific &quot;country tier rankings&quot; were assigned.   </p>
<p>   House Judiciary Committee Chairman F. James Sensenbrenner Jr.  (R-Wis.), who requested this GAO report along with House  International Relations Committee Chairman Henry J. Hyde (R- Ill.), said, &quot;I am deeply concerned about the stark deficiencies  highlighted by this report. I believe the report clearly  illustrates the need for the President to move the preparation of  the estimate of victims out of the intelligence community and  assign it instead to the Human Smuggling and Trafficking Center  (HSTC). The HSTC is a joint State, Homeland Security, and Justice  clearinghouse for all relevant human trafficking information, so  it should be able to accurately estimate the scale of human  trafficking. The HSTC can also assist in improving the  reliability of the country tier rankings.&quot;</p>
<p>   Hyde stated, &quot;The exploitation, mostly of women and children,  into the commercial sex industry and the trafficking of men,  women, boys and girls into forced labor on farms, in factories  and domestic servitude is an offense to the dignity of human  life. The congressionally mandated Trafficking in Persons Report  has increased global awareness and prompted more anti-trafficking  efforts. With each year, Congress will, no doubt, expect to see  ever increasing improvements in both data gathering and program  efficiency.&quot;</p>
<p>   Human trafficking occurs worldwide where people are bought,  sold and held in slave-like conditions. The Trafficking Victims  Protection Act of 2000 (TVPA) requires the federal government to  promote international programs to ensure punishment of  traffickers, to protect their victims and to prevent trafficking.</p>
<p>   The State Department publishes an annual Trafficking in  Persons Report, which includes a ranking of countries into tiers  based upon an assessment of foreign governments' compliance with  the four minimum standards for eliminating human trafficking set  by the TVPA. Three of the standards address whether the  countries' laws prohibit severe forms of trafficking and  proscribe penalties for trafficking crimes, while the fourth  standard is applied to assess actual efforts by the respective  government to enforce the laws and eliminate trafficking.</p>
<p>   What GAO Found: </p>
<p>   The GAO report, titled &quot;Human Trafficking, Better Data,  Strategy and Reporting Needed to Enhance U.S. Anti-Trafficking  Efforts Abroad,&quot; recommends that the government improve  information on trafficking, develop and implement a strategy  which clarifies agencies' roles and responsibilities and  establish a way to gauge results abroad, and clearly document the  rationale and support for country rankings.   </p>
<p>   The U.S. government needs a coordinated strategy to combat  trafficking in persons abroad. The U. S. government must measure  the performance of its programs to combat trafficking and,  consequently, evaluate which programs are effective. Its  coordination mechanisms ought to clearly delineate roles and  responsibilities for federal or international agencies, identify  needs, or leverage activities to achieve greater results. </p>
<p>   The State Department's annual Trafficking in Persons Report is  intended to serve as a guide, but agencies managing overseas  programs must use this diagnostic tool to identify and correct  deficiencies.  The report's country assessments must clearly  explain how the Department of State assessed each country against  anti-trafficking standards. The absence of detailed explanations  lessens the ability to bring about reform.  </p>
<p>   The U.S. government estimates that almost 800,000 people are  trafficked across international borders annually, but because of  deficiencies in analysis and data gaps, the GAO finds that this  estimate likely understates the extent of human trafficking.
