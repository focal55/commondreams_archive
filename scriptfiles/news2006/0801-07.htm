<p>WASHINGTON - August 1 - For American voters looking for solutions to their 
government's warrantless wiretapping of domestic phone calls, presidential 
signing statements, and torture of detainees, the Bill of Rights Defense 
Committee (BORDC, <a href="http://www.bordc.org" target="_new">www.bordc.org</a>) has just issued its 2006 Voter Information 
Guide.   The guide (<a href="http://www.bordc.org/candidates" target="_new">www.bordc.org/candidates</a>) helps voters cut through the 
maze of inside-the-Beltway doublespeak and political maneuvering to pin down 
candidates on where they stand and what they will do to resolve key civil 
liberties issues if they are elected.

<p>The BORDC's 2006 guide includes

<blockquote><li>Instructions and a timeline for preparing candidate questionnaires 
and publicizing the results;

<li>Guidelines for creating opportunities to engage candidates on 
civil liberties issues;

<p><li>Sample questions to pose to candidates about the President's 
program of electronic surveillance and other privacy issues, government 
accountability, due process for and treatment of detainees, and more;

<p><li>Searchable database of incumbents' voting records on key civil 
liberties issues.
</blockquote>
<p>According to BORDC director Nancy Talanian, "The Bill of Rights has become a 
political football in Washington, where politicians who are willing to 
protect their constituents' civil liberties are tagged as 'soft on 
terrorism.'  These tactics are leading the U.S. toward becoming 'one nation 
under surveillance,' and millions of people are rightfully concerned."

<p>As evidence that the American people recognize the importance of the Bill of 
Rights and are willing to defend it, Talanian points to more than 400 
resolutions passed by local and county governments and eight state 
legislatures upholding their 85 million residents' civil liberties.  The San 
Francisco Board of Supervisors recently became the first local government in 
the country to pass a resolution opposing the President's warrantless 
wiretapping program.
<p>Says Talanian, "People often forget that they hold the power to demand 
accountability from politicians.  Our Voter Information Guide is designed 
for them-so they can ask questions and get answers with which to make the 
right choices when they go to the polls this Election Day."
The Bill of Rights Defense Committee is a national nonprofit organization 
that encourages ordinary people to take an active role in an ongoing 
national debate about the post-9/11 laws and orders that threaten civil 
liberties guaranteed by the Bill of Rights.
