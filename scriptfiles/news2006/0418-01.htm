<p>WASHINGTON - April 18 - After up to 20 hours of detention, 36 staff members of ActionAid International Nepal, alongside representatives of other non-profit organizations, have been released by Nepalese authorities.

<p>The staff members had been among an estimated 200 people arrested Thursday while taking part in a peaceful march at a central Kathmandu location, Maitighar Mandala. Protesters had called for peace, human rights and democracy in Nepal.

<p>ActionAid International Nepal was one of approximately 60 international and national non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and civil society organizations taking part in this march. Dr. Shibesh Chandra Regmi, Country Director of ActionAid International Nepal and the Chair of International NGO Alliance in Nepal, were among those arrested. 

<p>As he was arrested Dr. Regmi said: “We have got no political agenda. We decided to express our concerns since ActionAid development work has been affected badly due to the prolonged conflict.”

<p>The detentions had followed the arrest and injury of lawyers during a demonstration by the Bar Association of Nepal held in Kathmandu earlier Thursday.

<p>Shekhar Ghimire, Head of Finance and Administration, ActionAid Nepal said: “All the detained staff of ActionAid Nepal are safe and are now back in the office.  We are grateful for all of the international support and solidarity during this time of need.”
