<p>WASHINGTON - May 22 - Approximately 200 antiwar activists from 32 states will meet on Monday, May 22, with over 100 Senators and House Members or their staff to urge them to end the Iraq War, prevent an Iran War, and hold the Bush Administration accountable for the claims it made in launching the Iraq War.  Activists will include Leslie Cagan, National Coordinator, United for Peace and Justice; Medea Benjamin, Co-founder, CODEPINK: Women for Peace; Tim Carpenter, Executive Director, Progressive Democrats of America; and Paul Kawika Martin, Executive Director, Peace Action.


<p>On Monday, May 22 from 9 am to 5 pm, peace, religious, medical, student, environmental, women's, and community organizations will visit legislators in the nation's Capitol for a National Antiwar Congressional Education Day. Participants from 32 states are expected to visit Senators and Congress Members from 104 Congressional Districts.


<p>This is the second in a series of Congressional Education days organized by United for Peace and Justice, the largest U.S. peace and justice coalition with more than 1,400 member groups under its umbrella. Since its founding in October 2002, UFPJ has spurred hundreds of protests and rallies around the country, including the two largest marches against the Iraq war on February 15, 2003, and August 29, 2004, during the Republican National Convention. http://www.unitedforpeace.org 


<p>"To date Congress has approved over $300 billion in emergency funding for a war most Americans, Iraqis, and active duty troops now consider unjustified.  We are here to give voice to the many who want to see Congress step up to its responsibilities and close the gap between the majority anti-war sentiment and congressional action for a speedy withdrawal of the troops from Iraq," said Leslie Cagan.  


<p>The delegations will be asking their representatives to counter any threat of a "preventive" strike in Iran which could result in thousands of new deaths and further instability in the Middle East.   Activists will advocate for a number of bills aimed at cutting off war funding and setting a timetable for withdrawal, as well as one bill, H Res 635, aimed at creating an investigation of possible impeachable offenses committed in the launching of and conducting of the war.


<p>WHEN: Monday, May 22, 2006 from 9 am to 5 pm EDT


<p>WHERE: Organizers and lobbyists will be based at the Methodist Building



<p>WHO: Organized by United for Peace and Justice (UFPJ)
