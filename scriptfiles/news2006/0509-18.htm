<p>WASHINGTON - May 9 - This coming Friday, in honor of Mother's Day and heralding a new era of peace, women around the country will visit their U.S. Congressional Representatives and Senators bearing Peace Pies and urging support of landmark legislation to create a U.S. Department of Peace.

<p>In states from Washington to Florida and California to Maine, these "ministers of peace" will engage in lively dialogue with Congressional staff members about the role this Department would play in strengthening national security and reducing domestic violence. They'll note that the pies represent the $400+ billion federal military budget and that the amount required to pay for a Department of Peace constitutes a tiny slice of the total (just two percent). These events are coordinated nationally by the Peace Alliance, a non-profit, trans-partisan organization actively campaigning in all 50 states for a US Department of Peace.  Visits to more than 150 Congressional and Senate offices are anticipated.

<p>The immediate goal of the Peace Alliance is to build support for passage of The Department of Peace and Nonviolence Act (Senate Bill S1756, and House Bill 3760), presently co-sponsored by sixty-three representatives and two senators.  The bills are virtually identical and are currently being discussed in committees.

<p>"The concept of peace is a universal ethic and we are all challenged to govern ourselves in a culture of peace," said Peace Alliance Executive Director Dot Maver, who recently addressed the Values Caucus at the United Nations. "It is time to create an infrastructure for peace that will focus on the principles of nonviolence and cooperation. I'd love to see the U.S. lead the global community in this endeavor. A U.S. Department of Peace would send a powerful message through Americans to the world that the United States intends to use its great strength to participate in a culture of peace."

<p>What would a U.S. Department of Peace do?  For starters, it would research and analyze foreign policy and recommend to the President ways to address the root causes of war. A Peace Academy, on par with the military academies, would train civilian peacekeepers and the military in the latest nonviolent conflict resolution techniques and approaches and peace building technologies. The Department would also provide expert advice to the President when diffusing or dealing with international crises.

<p>Domestically, the Department would, among other things, act as a clearing house for existing programs that successfully prevent, child abuse, domestic violence, gang violence, and cultural and racial violence.  The Department would provide much needed funding for programs to help reduce violence and proactively engage youth in mediation and conflict resolution.  Statistics reveal that each year, medical expenses from domestic violence alone total at least $3 to $5 billion. Businesses forfeit another $100 million in lost wages, sick leave, absenteeism and non-productivity due to domestic violence. Providing violence prevention and mediation tools to America's school children is just one of the many ways a U.S. Department of Peace would help reduce violence in our homes and schools.

<p>The drive to establish governmental bodies dedicated to peace is global in scope, with grassroots organizations in Australia, Canada, Costa Rica, Great Britain, Israel, Palestine, Japan, and elsewhere urging their governments to establish Ministries or Departments of Peace. Representatives from these countries and others are calling on their governments to declare Sept 21st a peace day, in honor of the United Nations' International Day of Peace, and urging individuals everywhere to pledge to live that day in nonviolence.

<p>Maver and thousands of U.S. Department of Peace supporters believe the United States is ready to help lead the world toward peace. "The International Day of Peace calls for a day of global ceasefire and nonviolence," concludes Maver. "We want nonviolent conflict resolution to become part of the fabric of our everyday lives. And we'll take a big step this Friday when we'll ask our Representatives in Washington to share a slice of the pie for peace."
