<p>WASHINGTON - October 25 - Ranking Member of the House Government Reform Subcommittee on National Security, Emerging Threats and International Relations, issued the following statement today in support of "Appeal for Redress" a group of active duty military personal who are calling for the US to end the war in Iraq:

<p>"No one speaks with more moral authority or understanding of the complexity of Iraq then the brave men and women who serve in our Armed Forces and who have done tours of duty in Iraq. The men and women who have joined this effort have demonstrated courage and bravery and represent the very best of our nation. 

<p>"These soldiers cut through the political spin and false rhetoric to deliver a stark and important message: It is time to end the war in Iraq and bring our troops home with the honor and dignity they deserve. 

<p>"I am proud to stand with the courageous men and women of Appeal for Redress and will continue my efforts to end the grave misadventure in Iraq and bring all our troops home."
