<p>WASHINGTON - February 16 - In light of Friday's meeting 
between the presidents of Timor-Leste and 
Indonesia, the East Timor and Indonesia Action 
Network (ETAN) today called on Indonesia to fully 
accept the findings and enact the recommendations 
of Timor-Leste's Commission for Reception, Truth 
and Reconciliation (known by its Portuguese 
acronym, CAVR). The presidents are expected to 
discuss the report and the bilateral Indonesia - 
Timor-Leste Commission on Truth and Friendship.

<p>"Indonesia bears primary responsibility for the 
illegal invasion and occupation of East Timor," 
said John M. Miller, National Coordinator of 
ETAN. "Instead of seeking to bury the past, 
Indonesia should ensure that those responsible 
for crimes against humanity and other systematic 
human rights violations in Timor-Leste are 
brought to justice. This would send a strong 
message to a still recalcitrant military," he 
added. "The cycle of impunity in Indonesia cannot 
end and democracy fully flourish until there is real justice for Timor-Leste."

<p>ETAN posted the full CAVR report on its website 
today.  (See http://www.etan.org/news/2006/cavr.htm.)

<p>"President Gusmao asked NGOs to help make the 
CAVR report widely available once he had 
delivered it to the UN and certain governments, 
which has happened," said Miller, who met with 
Gusmao in January. "The report contains 
information that needs to be widely known. 
Indonesia, the United States, the UN and others 
must act on its recommendations."

<p>The CAVR report states that a new relationship 
between Timor-Leste and Indonesia requires "the 
principles of acknowledging the truth of the 
past, accountability for violence, and a spirit 
of generosity in assisting those who have been harmed by that violence."

<p>The report calls on Indonesia to provide "full 
documentation of military operations resulting in 
human rights violations of civilians"; revise its 
official account so as to "give the Indonesian 
people an accurate and comprehensive account of 
the period 1974 to 1999"; and cooperate "fully 
with any future international or East Timorese 
initiatives established to address justice for 
violations of human rights committed in 
Timor-Leste between 1974 and 1999." The report 
also recommends that the Indonesian government, 
as well as Indonesian businesses which profited 
from the occupation, contribute to a reparations trust fund.

<p>The CAVR report is the product of three years of 
intensive research by hundreds of East Timorese 
and international experts and is based on 
information from more than 8000 witnesses and 
victims. The report found that at least 102,800 
people died from 1975 to 1999 as a result of 
Indonesia's invasion and occupation.

<p>The report is critical of the Commission on Truth and Friendship.

<p>"Under its current mandate the Truth and 
Friendship Commission (TFC), established over 
public opposition, does not meet international 
human rights standards," said Miller. "It cannot 
refer anyone for prosecution for serious crimes 
but can propose amnesties. The international 
community, including the U.S. government, must 
not use the TFC to dodge responsibility for 
accountability," he added. The two presidents 
plan to discuss the TFC during their meeting.

<p>The CAVR report covers the period from 1974 to 
1999 and urges increased attention to crimes 
committed before 1999, including the 99% of the 
total murders committed under the Suharto 
dictatorship, which received strong backing from 
foreign governments. UN-sponsored justice 
processes have so far limited their work to 1999.

<p>ETAN advocates for democracy, justice and human 
rights for East Timor and Indonesia. ETAN calls 
for an international tribunal to prosecute crimes 
against humanity committed in East Timor from 
1975 to 1999 and for restrictions on U.S. 
military assistance to Indonesia until there is 
genuine reform of its security forces. For more
