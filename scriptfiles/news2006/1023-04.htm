<p>SILVER SPRING, Maryland - October 23 - With the  impacts of global warming spiraling out of control in the form of  wildfires, heat waves, hurricanes, floods and sea-level rise,  protesters today dramatically occupied the entrance to a leading  federal agency and demanded an immediate change in U.S. policy  toward fossil fuels. </p>

Gathering at the headquarters of the National Oceanic and  Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) in Silver Spring, Md., two  protesters peacefully occupied a ledge above the building's front  entrance and unfurled a huge banner reading: &quot;Bush: Let NOAA Tell  the Truth.&quot; Other protesters on the ground blocked and occupied  the building's main entrance.  </p>
<p>With political influence from the White House, leaders at NOAA  have repeatedly ignored or actively suppressed agency science  detailing the threat of global warming. NOAA has also blocked  journalists from talking to scientists warning about climate  danger. These widely reported actions have drawn growing  condemnation from the media and Congressional leaders. (See  Greenpeace summary) </p>
<p>Today's protest is part of an escalating campaign to draw  attention to the Bush Administration's failed policies on global  warming. Calling George Bush the nation's &quot;Denier-in-Chief,&quot;  protesters associated with the U.S. Climate Emergency Council and  Chesapeake Climate Action Network carried large photos showing  climate chaos worldwide. Demonstrators called for the resignation  of NOAA director Conrad Lautenbacher.</p>
<p>&quot;Every day, wherever one looks in the world, there are  accelerating signs of climate danger,&quot; said Mike Tidwell,  director of the U.S. CEC and one of the protesters arrested.  &quot;From satellite imagery from space to measurements deep in our  oceans to the daily observations of average Americans, weird and  alarming climate impacts are now in plain view. Yet NOAA, in  blatant violation of its mission statement, suppresses this  truth. And George Bush enforces this censorship as policy. It's  time for concerned citizens to stand up and demand action.&quot;</p>
<p>Protesters called on the Bush Administration to &quot;join reality  and the rest of the world&quot; by re-entering the international Kyoto  Protocol process designed to cut fossil fuel use. A sensible  first step would be for Bush and Congress to drop its utterly  failed policy of &quot;voluntary&quot; greenhouse gas reductions and  instead adopt a plan similar to the one just signed by Republican  California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger. That plan calls for a  mandatory 25 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by  2020 in California.</p>
<p>A national effort must include dramatic but feasible  improvements in energy efficiency, including an average increase  to 40 mpg in the nation's car and truck fleet. Huge investments  in renewable energy, like wind power and bio-fuels, are also  needed immediately, the group says.</p>
<p>Protestors chose NOAA for their action because the agency's  politically appointed leadership has failed to fulfill its  official mission to warn Americans about &quot;dangerous weather&quot; and  &quot;improve our understanding and stewardship of the environment.&quot;  The NOAA leadership blatantly ignores or denies the growing  scientific evidence of climate chaos, including studies from  within NOAA itself. </p>
<p>For example, despite having the words &quot;atmospheric&quot; and  &quot;oceanic&quot; in its very name, NOAA's Web site contains virtually no  reference to the seven major scientific studies in the last 14  months linking atmospheric warming to an observed increase in  hurricane intensity. Indeed, according to NOAA scientist Ants  Leetmaa, the agency refused to release an internal review by NOAA  scientists last May projecting stronger future hurricanes due to  global warming. (See USA Today story). </p>
<p>And recent press reports in the Wall Street Journal, the  Washington Post and elsewhere show how the NOAA leadership has  tried to keep its climate scientists from talking to journalists.  In September, U.S. Congressman Henry Waxman called on NOAA to  release relevant agency documents after an internal NOAA email  showed media officials there intentionally steering an MSNBC  journalist away from a climate scientist whose data shows climate  impacts to be worsening, something the White House clearly wants  to keep from wide public scrutiny. (See Waxman's website and  Salon.com article). </p>
<p>The U.S. CEC, as a result, is today calling for NOAA director  Lautenbacher's immediate resignation. Such a move would be a  good-faith first step in signaling the Bush Administration's  willingness, finally, to begin protecting Americans from the  economic, agricultural, environmental and national-security harm  global warming is beginning to cause.</p>
