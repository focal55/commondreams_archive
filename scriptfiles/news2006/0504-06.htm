<p>WASHINGTON - May 4 - Noting that free expression and the right to dissent are among 
the core principles which the American flag represents, the American Civil 
Liberties Union today expressed its disappointment that a key Senate panel 
failed to protect the Constitution when it passed the Flag Desecration 
Amendment. The House passed the Flag Desecration Amendment by a narrow 
eight-vote margin last year.</P>
<P>"If we take away the right to dissent - no matter how unpopular - what 
freedom will be sacrificed next?" said Caroline Fredrickson, Director of the 
ACLU Washington Legislative Office. "The First Amendment must be protected most 
when it comes to unpopular speech. Failure to do so fails the very notion of 
freedom of expression. We urge the full Senate to reject election year politics 
and stand for the Constitution."</P>
<P>The Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights, and 
Property Rights today approved S.J.R. 12, the Flag Desecration Amendment, which 
would allow Congress to criminalize any "physical desecration" of the American 
flag. If adopted, it would be the first time the Constitution has been used to 
restrict freedoms since Prohibition. The ACLU noted that proposals to ban flag 
desecration or burning have been consistently rejected by the Supreme Court and 
Congress since first introduced in the late 1980s, and polls have shown the 
public has grown increasingly averse to including censorship in the 
Constitution.</P>
<P>The ACLU pointed to a survey released in early June of 2005 by the First 
Amendment Center in which 63 percent of those polled said that the Constitution 
"should not be amended to prohibit burning or desecrating the American flag." 
This number was 10 percentage points higher than the same survey conducted last 
year. The same survey found that support for the amendment dropped from 45 
percent last year to 35 percent this year.</P>
<P>Opposition to the amendment remains ideologically broad. Former Secretary of 
State and former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Colin Powell said in a 
1999 letter, "The First Amendment exists to insure that freedom of speech and 
expression applies not just to that with which we agree or disagree, but also 
that which we find outrageous." In addition to Powell, former Senator John Glenn 
and former Reagan Defense Department official Lawrence J. Korb, have all spoken 
out against the proposal. Veterans Defending the Bill of Rights, Veterans for 
Peace and Veterans for Common Sense have also been vocal in their opposition.</P>
<P>"If this measure passes, it would put the symbol above the values it 
represents," said Terri Ann Schroeder, an ACLU Senior Lobbyist. "The strength of 
our democracy is that we tolerate all peaceful forms of expression, no matter 
how uncomfortable they make us feel, or how much we disagree. We hope that the 
Senate will ultimately reject this attack on the Constitution."</P>
