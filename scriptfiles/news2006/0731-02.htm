<p>WASHINGTON - July 31 - Nancy Keenan, president of NARAL Pro-Choice America, released the following statement on the recent announcement by the Food and Drug Administration that it will reconsider an application by Barr Pharmaceuticals to approve the 'morning-after' pill, also known as Plan B®, for over-the-counter sales. 

<p>"Americans are tired of the Bush administration playing politics and blocking women's access to this effective form of birth control. Plan B® could prevent unintended pregnancies and reduce the need for abortion. We are cautiously optimistic that after more than three years of delays, sound science could prevail.  We are eager to see the FDA put women’s health before ideology, and approve the application for the 'morning-after' pill."

<p>NARAL Pro-Choice America has channeled tens of thousands of messages to the FDA, including the delivery of more then 5,000 hourglass timers and petitions to their headquarters, asking the agency to end the three-year delay on approving the ‘morning-after’ pill for over-the-counter access.
