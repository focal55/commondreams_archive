<p>WASHINGTON - July 31 - 
<p><B><A href="mailto:jchomsky@igc.org">JUDITH BROWN CHOMSKY</A></B><br>
Judith Brown Chomsky is a cooperating attorney with the Center for Constitutional Rights, which is litigating a class action lawsuit in U.S. federal court in connection with Israel's 1996 shelling of a UN compound also in Qana, Lebanon, which killed more than 100 civilians.
<p>She said today: "Ten years ago the U.S. ensured that the UN investigation into the massacre at Qana did not reach a full conclusion, and today the U.S. is preventing the UN from doing what it is morally obligated to do, which is call for an immediate cease fire. The green light that the U.S. is giving to Israel's continued attack on Lebanon will ensure that there are more Qanas."
<p><B>MAHMOUD SHALHOUB</B><br>
Available for a limited number of interviews, Shalhoub is originally from Qana, Lebanon. Now a restaurateur in Troy, Mich., he lost 43 of his family members in Sunday's shelling in Qana. He said today, "My cousin and his entire family were murdered. Only his wife survived -- they found her under the rubble. How can she continue her life? This is very difficult to handle. I can't handle it."
