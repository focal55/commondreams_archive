<p>WASHINGTON - January 9 - Americans for Democratic Action (ADA) views the nomination of Judge Samuel Alito to the Supreme Court as a monumental threat to basic civil rights and civil liberties that many Americans have worked so hard to protect.

<p>"Judge Alito has made a career out of writing one troubling opinion after another," states Amy F. Isaacs, national director of ADA. His opinions concerning federalism, civil rights (including discrimination based on race, gender, and disability), reproductive rights, and the First Amendment are particularly disturbing. Perhaps the single most disturbing revelation about Judge Alito is that he flat out lied to the Judiciary Committee 15 years ago while being confirmed to the Appeals Court. 

<p>Judge Alito's opinions have supported: the transfer and possession of machine guns; the implementation of rules making it more difficult for victims of racial, gender, or disability discrimination to seek restitution; onerous restrictions on reproductive choice; restrictions on freedom of speech; and numerous other alarming threats to individual rights.

<p>ADA will follow the nomination process closely and urges the Senate to use its role of advice and consent carefully in order to protect the independence of the U.S. Supreme Court and the rights and freedoms of all Americans.

<p>ADAction Alert: Contact your Senators and urge them to support an independent and balance judiciary by voting NO on Samuel Alito's confirmation. The Capital Switchboard is 202-225-3121
