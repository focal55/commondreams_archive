<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">NEW YORK - February 23 - Yesterday, the U.S. Census Bureau released a study on the feasibility of counting people in prison at their permanent homes of record during the next Census. Although mandated by Congress to study &#x201C;using prisoners&#x2019; permanent homes of record, as opposed to their incarceration sites, when determining their residences,&#x201D; criminal justice enumeration experts say that the Census report barely scratches the surface on methods and options for achieving this goal. </font></p>
									<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#x201C;The report shows either short shrift in a work product, or a shocking lack of creativity and vision,&#x201D; said Michael Waldman, Executive Director of the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law. &#x201C;The Census Bureau capably solves complicated data collection problems everyday, yet throws in the towel before even entering the ring on the accurate counting of millions of people.&#x201D;</font></p>
									<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In Tabulating Prisoners at Their &#x201C;Permanent Home of Record&#x201D; Address, the Bureau focuses primarily on the most burdensome and expensive way to collect information: interviewing each person in prison or jail on Census Day. This method, the agency concludes, would be too costly &#150; some $250 million in 2010.  At a cost of about $100 per person in prison, this cost is almost twice as much as the $56 the Bureau expects to spend enumerating each U.S. household in 2010.</font></p>
									<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Criminal justice experts say, however, that this presents an incomplete and misleadingly negative picture. &#x201C;There are several ways to identify &#x2018;home&#x2019; addresses and use them at census time,&#x201D; said <a href="../../about_us/aboutus_bios.html#kirsten">Kirsten D. Levingston</a>, Director of the Criminal Justice Program at New York University&#x2019;s Brennan Center for Justice. &#x201C;The Bureau&#x2019;s report does not evaluate the feasibility or cost of those other options, and completely fails to address the importance of accuracy in this area.&#x201D;<br>
											<br>
</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A recent report by the Criminal Justice Program analyzes how critical solving this problem is to census accuracy, and identifies four options for conducting a more accurate count. The <a href="../../programs/cj/Home%20in%202010.pdf" target="_blank">report</a>, <i>Home in 2010: A Report on the Feasibility of Enumerating People in Prison at their Home Addresses in the Next Census</i>,  evaluates several options: using existing records, distributing census forms to people in prison, interviewing people whose forms are incomplete or illegible, and enumerating people at the prison if they do not have a home address.</font></p>
									<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#x201C;This study is a start, but Congress and the American people need real information in order to make the best decisions for communities across the nation,&#x201D; Levingston said. &#x201C;This level of inaccuracy in the Census may have been good enough in the past; but with over 2 million of our nation&#x2019;s population now behind bars, it&#x2019;s no longer acceptable. The Bureau must find a way to produce fair and accurate information about this population.&#x201D;</font></p>
