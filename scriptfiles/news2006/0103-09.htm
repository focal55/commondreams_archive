<p>WASHINGTON - January 3 -  The Campaign for America's Future today announced that it will unveil new advertisements next week about Rep. Bob Ney (R-Ohio) and his involvement in a growing web of corruption in Washington. Court papers released today when Washington lobbyist Jack Abramoff pleaded guilty to federal charges of conspiracy, tax evasion and mail fraud, detailed lavish gifts and contributions that he gave Rep. Ney in return for Ney's agreement to use his office to aid Abramoff clients.</p>
<p>   &quot;This is the worst corruption scandal to hit Washington since Watergate. Abramoff is fingering Reps. Bob Ney and Tom DeLay as central figures in the scandal,&quot; said Campaign for America's Future Communications Director Toby Chaudhuri. &quot;There's a cancer growing on this Congress.&quot;</p>

<p>   Abramoff today also agreed with U.S. District Court Judge Ellen Huvelle when she said he and others had engaged in a scheme to provide campaign contributions, trips and other items &quot;in exchange for certain official acts,&quot; according to the Associated Press. The Washington Post recently reported that Rep. Ney received political contributions, tickets to sporting events and an all-expense paid golf trip to Scotland in exchange for his political favors.</p>
<p>   The Campaign for America's Future ran several print and radio ads last year questioning whether Rep. Ney serves his constituents or the lobbyists who fund his campaigns.</p>
