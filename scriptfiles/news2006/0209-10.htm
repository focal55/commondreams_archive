<p>NEW YORK - February 9 - As avian flu strikes Africa for the first time, CARE International, a leader in the fight against the disease, is sharing its expertise at a United Nations briefing today on the threats and challenges of a possible pandemic of avian flu.</p>

<p>As a poverty-fighting organization with significant expertise in disaster preparedness and response, CARE is well positioned to address avian flu on many levels. CARE has a long-term presence in 70 developing countries and strong relationships with government and community organizations.</p>

<p>"CARE is working with communities to provide training and education on avian influenza, to contain avian influenza at its source," says Dr. Sanjay Sinho, CARE's health program director. "The other key to preventing the spread of the virus is addressing people's livelihoods. People fear reporting sick birds because their flocks will be destroyed and they may not be compensated for their losses. So instead, they hide the sick birds or sell them and that, in turn, contributes to the transmission of avian flu to new areas."</p>

<p>A farmer responding to a CARE survey in Binh Dinh province, Vietnam said: "If I reported, they would kill the whole flock and I would&nbsp;lose everything."&nbsp;</p>

<p>In many developing countries, including Nigeria, the latest country to report bird flu, poor communities depend heavily on the income they receive from raising poultry. In communities where poultry raising is a woman's activity, women's livelihoods are further at risk. Governments in developing countries often do not have the financial resources or systems for speedy disbursement for adequately compensating farmers for their culled flocks.</p>

<p>"It is hard enough to contain an outbreak of disease when it is reported immediately and when there are good systems in place," says Dr.Sinho. "But many developing countries have little or no human and animal health systems in place to deal with an emerging pandemic such as avian flu. Much of the money pledged at the recent conference for avian flu needs to go toward livelihood issues like compensation for destroyed birds, so people will report outbreaks more quickly, and to strengthening health systems," adds Dr. Sinho.</p>

<p>Donor countries at a World Bank conference on avian flu in Beijing recently pledged $1.9 billion to combat avian flu around the world, but it is not clear how that money will be used.</p>

<p>International nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and civil society groups have received limited funding for avian flu. CARE has received some funding for avian flu and has put those resources to work teaching people safe ways to raise their poultry, improving poultry handling techniques and provided safety equipment to farmers. The organization has also developed three television public service announcements promoting avian flu education that are currently airing in Vietnam. Thirty-two of CARE's country offices are involved with avian influenza response planning including all of East Africa. The range of activities in these countries covers surveillance, reporting, education of farmers, promoting hygiene, coping with social unrest and staff protection.</p>

<p>The United Nations briefing is designed to share this and other knowledge among different NGOs about how to best prevent and contain the virus.</p>

<p>For the past several months avian flu experts have been warning that the virus was likely to show up in the Great Rift Valley in East Africa. This line of thinking grew out of theories that migratory birds are the main drivers of avian flu between countries. Yet the disease jumped to West Africa instead. Wildlife groups have suggested that it is not just wild birds spreading avian flu as they migrate, but that the trade of poultry and exotic birds also plays a large role.</p>

<p>"This virus is jumping from continent to continent and the fact is that we don't know exactly how," comments Dr. Sinho. "It's a gaping hole in our knowledge that needs to be addressed urgently."</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
