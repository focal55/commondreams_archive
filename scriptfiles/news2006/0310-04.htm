<p> GENEVA - March 10 - Today, in a historic and  strongly worded decision by the United Nations Committee on the  Elimination of Racial Discrimination (CERD) the United States was  urged to &quot;freeze&quot;, &quot;desist&quot; and &quot;stop&quot; actions being taken or  threatened to be taken against the Western Shoshone Peoples of  the Western Shoshone Nation. In its decision, CERD stressed the  &quot;nature and urgency&quot; of the Shoshone situation informing the U.S.  that it goes &quot;well beyond&quot; the normal reporting process and  warrants immediate attention under the Committee's Early Warning  and Urgent Action Procedure.  </p>
<p>   This monumental action challenges the US government's  assertion of federal ownership of nearly 90 percent of Western  Shoshone lands.  The land base covers approximately 60 million  acres, stretching across what is now referred to as the states of  Nevada, Idaho, Utah and California.  Western Shoshone rights to  the land -- which they continue to use, care for, and occupy  today -- were recognized by the United States in 1863 by the  Treaty of Ruby Valley.  The U.S. now claims these same lands as  &quot;public&quot; or federal lands through an agency process and has  denied Western Shoshone fair access to U.S. courts through that  same process.  The land base has been and continues to be used by  the United States for military testing, open pit cyanide heap  leach gold mining and nuclear waste disposal planning. The U.S.  has engaged in military style seizures of Shoshone livestock,  trespass fines in the millions of dollars and ongoing armed  surveillance of Western Shoshone who continue to assert their  original and treaty rights.</p>
<p>   Based upon these actions and a dramatic escalation of new  actions threatening irreparable harm to Western Shoshone and  their environment, last year, with the support of the Univ. of  Arizona Indigenous Law and Policy Program, the Western Shoshone  filed a renewed legal action at the United Nations CERD. In  addition to evidence of the United States' conduct, the Western  Shoshone delegation also delivered over 13,000 signatures from  citizens across the United States of America supporting the  Western Shoshone action to CERD. This petition was a result of a  campaign organized by the rights-based development organization  Oxfam America to demonstrate the widespread concern for the  Western Shoshone peoples to the United Nations.</p>
<p>   CERD rejected the U.S.' argument that the situation was not  &quot;novel&quot; and therefore should wait to be reviewed until the U.S.  submits its Periodic Report -- past due since 2003.  The  Committee informed the U.S. that &quot;(a)lthough these are indeed  long-standing issues...they warrant immediate and effective action...  (and) should be dealt with as a matter of priority.&quot;   The United  States was &quot;urged to pay particular attention to the right to  health and cultural rights of the Western Shoshone...which may be  infringed upon by activities threatening their environment and/or  disregarding the spiritual and cultural significance they give to  their ancestral lands.&quot;</p>
<p>   CERD presented its decision to the Western Shoshone this  morning.  The decision details the U.S.' actions against the  Western Shoshone and calls upon the United States to immediately:</p>
<p>   -- Respect and protect the human rights of the Western  Shoshone peoples;</p>
<p>   -- Initiate a dialogue with the representatives of the Western  Shoshone peoples in order to find a solution acceptable to them,  and which complies with their rights;</p>
<p>   -- Adopt the following measures until a final decision or  settlement is reached on the status, use and occupation of  Western Shoshone ancestral lands in accordance with due process  of law and the U.S.' obligations under the Convention;</p>
<p>   -- Freeze all efforts to privatize Western Shoshone ancestral  lands for transfer to multinational extractive industries and  energy developers;</p>
<p>   -- Desist from all activities planned and/or conducted on  Western Shoshone ancestral lands;</p>
<p>   -- Stop imposing grazing fees, livestock impoundments,  hunting, fishing and gathering restrictions and rescind all  notices already made.</p>
<p>   The decision is historic in that it is the first time a United  Nations Committee has issued a full decision against the U.S. in  respect to its highly controversial Federal Indian law and  policy.  The decision expressed particular concern that the U.S.'  basis for claiming federal title to Western Shoshone land rests  on a theory of &quot;gradual encroachment&quot; through a &quot;compensation&quot;  process in the Indian Claims Commission.  The decision highlights  that this same process was found by the Inter-American Commission  on Human Rights to violate &quot;international human rights norms,  principles and standards that govern determination of indigenous  property interests.&quot;  When the U.S. last appeared before the  Committee in 2001, Committee members expressed alarm and concern  that U.S. laws regarding indigenous peoples continue to be based  on the outdated, colonial era &quot;doctrine of discovery.&quot;  </p>
<p>   The Committee gave the U.S. a July 15, 2006 deadline to  provide it with information on the action it had taken.  The  decision issued today demonstrates a solid commitment by the  United Nations human rights system to make the Western Shoshone's  struggle a priority. Whereas indigenous peoples have been active  at the United Nations for several decades, the decision today  also brings a breath of hope to indigenous communities across the  U.S. and globally where the negative effects of U.S. policy and  influence reach.  In its decision, the Committee drew particular  attention to its General recommendation 23 (1997) on the rights  of indigenous peoples, in particular their right to own, develop,  control and use their communal lands, territories and resources. </p>

<p>   Comments from Western Shoshone Delegation to United Nations  (March 10, 2006):</p>
<p>   &quot;We have rights to protect our homelands and stop the  destruction of our land, water, and air by the abuses of the  United States government and the multinational corporations.  The  situation is outrageous and we're glad the United Nations  Committee agrees with us.  Our people have suffered more nuclear  testing than anywhere else in the world and they're continuing  underground testing despite our protests.  Yucca Mountain is  being hollowed out in order to store nuclear waste.  We cannot  stand for it -- this earth, the air, the water are sacred.   People of all races must stop this insanity now in order to  secure a safe future for all.&quot;  -- Joe Kennedy, Western Shoshone.</p>
<p>   &quot;The Western Shoshone Nation is very thankful to the Committee  members for their decision affirming U.S. discrimination and  destructive policies do not go on unaccounted for.  Truth is what  it is -- that can never change.  We pray for the healing of our  peoples, the land and the harassment and destruction to stop.   While others are allowed the freedom of religion, we are kept  from the very same right.  The Newe (people) use this ancestral  land for sacred ceremonies. The federal agencies prevent our  access to some of these important areas.  Our ancestors' burials  are being dug up and placed into local museums' basement storage  areas because of surge of gold mines and nuclear developments.   This is an outrage to our people.&quot;  -- Judy Rojo, Western  Shoshone.</p>
<p>   &quot;This battle has been going on for quite some time, but we've  seen a dramatic increase in the federal government and the  companies' rush to finalize what they consider a settlement in  order to get a hold of our lands for activities that are  contaminating our water and our air.  Again, we are very pleased  that our rights are finally being taken seriously and we look  forward to positive actions being taken by the U.S.&quot;  -- Steven  Brady, Western Shoshone.</p>
<p>   &quot;We are Shoshone delegates speaking for a Nation threatened by  extinction.  The mines are polluting our waters, destroying hot  springs and exploding sacred mountains-our burials along with  them--attempting to erase our signature on the land.  We are  coerced and threatened by mining and Federal agencies when we  seek to continue spiritual prayers for traditional food or  medicine on Shoshone land.  We have endured murder of our Newe  people for centuries, as chronicled in military records, but now  we are asked to endure a more painful death from the U.S.  governmental agencies -- a separation from land and spiritual  renewal. We thank our past leaders for their persistence and  courage and the CERD for this monumental step.&quot;  -- Bernice Lalo,  Western Shoshone.</p>
