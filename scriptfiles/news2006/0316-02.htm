<p>WASHINGTON - March 16 - This weekend, military families in at least 26 states and 
Puerto Rico will be participating in over 50 events including vigils, 
rallies, teach-ins, press conferences, marches and demonstrations 
commemorating the 3rd anniversary of a war that should never have happened.

<p>Military families with loved ones currently in Iraq, those with loved ones 
who may deploy or redeploy, those with loved ones who have returned with 
physical and psychological wounds, and families with loved ones who died as 
the result of the war in Iraq, will be speaking out and calling on members 
of Congress and Senators to show some leadership, end the war in Iraq, bring 
our troops home now and take care of them when they get here.

<p>Speaking out through tears, fear and pain, families with loved ones who are 
serving, have served or may serve in Iraq will pay tribute to the over 2,300 
U.S. service men and women and the tens of thousands of Iraqi children, 
women and men who have lost their lives as a result of a war based on lies. 
Military families will speak about their loved ones and all who remain in 
harm’s way because of the continued U.S. occupation of Iraq. In many of the 
upcoming events families will be joining Iraq War Veterans and Veterans of 
other eras to tell the ‘ground truth’ of this war. These families, service 
members and former service men and women will speak about the human cost of 
the war – a cost that the Bush Administration still seeks to keep hidden, as 
it continues to ban the photographing of the flag-draped coffins returning 
to Dover Air Force Base.

<p>Events involving Military Families Speak Out members are now scheduled to 
take place in Alabama, California, Connecticut, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, 
Kentucky, Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New 
Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, 
Tennessee, Utah, Virginia, Vermont, Washington, Washington D.C., Wisconsin 
and Puerto Rico. Events in additional states may be added. To see a complete 
list (updated regularly) and details of events, see www.mfso.org. Contact 
Ryan Fletcher at 202-641-0277 or Nancy Lessin at 617-320-5301 to speak with 
military families involved with events listed.

<p>Military Families Speak Out (MFSO) was founded in November, 2002 by two 
military families speaking out to try to prevent a U.S. invasion of Iraq. 
The membership of MFSO now includes over 3,000 military families speaking 
out to end the war, bring our troops home now and take care of them when 
they get here. It is the largest organization of military families opposing 
a war in the history of the United States.
