<p>WASHINGTON - February 6 - In a new report,  Guantanamo: Lives Torn Apart, published today, Amnesty  International exposes the impact of detention in the Guantanamo  Bay detention center on detainees and their families; thousands  are being condemned to a life of emotional and physical suffering  and torment.</p>
<p>   The report contains testimonies from former detainees and  their relatives revealing how once a person is picked up and  labeled an 'enemy combatant' by the United States, his life  becomes one of constant torment and stigma.  This terror does not  end when the man is released and sent back to his home country.   Many former detainees, even when reunited with their families,  continue to be harassed, arbitrarily arrested and ill-treated by  their own government.</p>
<p>   "Absolutely outrageous," said Dr. William F. Schulz, Executive  Director of Amnesty International USA.  "If someone is no longer  considered an 'enemy combatant,' either he was erroneously  detained in the first place or he has undergone a miraculous  conversion.  In either case, he will never be free from the  stigma of being labeled a "terrorist."  Moreover, the lives of  the detainees' families frequently spiral down into financial and  emotional devastation. The denial of due process we have  witnessed at Guantanamo Bay violates fundamental human rights  law, to say nothing of our highest values as a nation."</p>
<p>   There are approximately 500 men from 35 countries detained in  Guantanamo, and only a couple of them have had a review of their  detention in a court of law. In addition, at least nine men  continue to be held in Guantanamo despite no longer being labeled  as "enemy combatants" by the U.S. government. The report also  provides a timely account of those who continue to be imprisoned  at Guantanamo, including developments in relation to the ongoing  hunger strike and suicide attempts.</p>
<p>   According to testimonies Amnesty International collected,  there are many families who know that their relatives are or have  been detained by the United States, yet have received little or  no communication from Guantanamo.</p>
<p>   Nina Odizheva, the mother of former Russian Guantanamo  detainee Ruslan Odizheva, described how the time spent in U.S.  detention had irrevocably affected her son: "It changed him...he  is completely ill...he lives on pills for all his major  organs...he tries not to show it or tell me details so I don't  get upset...he has no appetite...he is a different person now..."</p>
<p>   "The Bush Administration cannot simply ignore the consequences  of its actions on innocent family members around the world.  It  cannot continue to hold people indefinitely without meaningful  legal recourse or due process. Either charge these men with  recognizable criminal offenses and try them in an established  court or release them immediately," said Schulz.</p>
<p>   Amnesty International urges Congress to establish a fully  independent and impartial commission to conduct public  investigations into the reports of abuse in U.S.-controlled  detention centers, including secret ones, around the world and to  offer preventive measures to stop torture and inhuman treatment.</p>
