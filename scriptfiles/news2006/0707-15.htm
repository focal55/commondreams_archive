WASHINGTON - July 7 - 

Consumers Union, the independent, non-profit publisher of Consumer Reports, today submitted the following comments to the Citizens Health Care Working Group (CHCWC), congratulating them for their strong interim recommendations to ensure health care for all Americans. Consumers Union is particularly supportive of the emphasis on evidence-based medicine as a way to hold down America's crippling health care costs. 

<p>"The Citizens Health Care Working Group has come up with strong recommendations that would address most consumer concerns about the American health care mess," said William Vaughan, a senior health policy analyst at Consumers Union. "We hope more Americans will contribute their support and that Congress will translate the recommendations into action,” added Vaughan.

<p>The CHCWG was created as part of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act Of 2003. The group is in the process of receiving public comments on the interim report and Congress will hold hearing based on the recommendations.
