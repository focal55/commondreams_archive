<p>BOSTON, MA– Today the National Network of Abortion Funds (NNAF), an association of grassroots groups that raises funding for low-income women seeking abortions, announced the launch of the National Reproductive Justice Fund to help low-income women affected by the South Dakota and other state abortion bans.  “We will not allow politicians in South Dakota to deny women the right to make decisions about their lives and their futures,” said NNAF Executive Director Stephanie Poggi.  “Our new national fund will ensure that women have the resources and help they need to obtain abortions – no matter what the South Dakota legislature does.”  In addition, NNAF supports efforts to overturn the ban including the ballot initiative and the election of pro-choice candidates to the state legislature.  

<p>On March 6, South Dakota Governor Rounds signed House Bill 1215, the most restrictive ban on abortion since Roe v. Wade.  While harming all women in South Dakota, HB 1215 would have a disproportionate impact on low-income women.  “Poor women, who already struggle to raise the money needed for abortion services, will now have to work harder than ever to raise money to travel out of state for an abortion,” noted NNAF’s Poggi. “Women already postpone paying for other basic needs including rent, utility bills, and food for their families.”  Some also travel up to 700 miles roundtrip in one day because they cannot afford to pay for a hotel room in Sioux Falls, where the state’s one abortion clinic is located.  

<p>The abortion ban threatens to make true for all South Dakota women what low-income women in the state have faced for 30 years.  For the last three decades, poor women in South Dakota have been effectively denied their right to abortion care because South Dakota and 32 other states virtually eliminated Medicaid coverage of abortions after Congress banned federal funding under the Hyde Amendment in 1976.  Federal law also prohibits the Indian Health Service from paying for abortions except in cases of rape, incest, and danger to the woman’s life.

<p>The National Network of Abortion Funds has created the National Reproductive Justice Fund to help low-income women affected by the South Dakota ban.  The new fund will complement the efforts of one of NNAF’s member funds, South Dakota Access for Every Woman.  “People are already confused and scared --  we’ve had calls from women who ask if abortion is still legal,” cautioned Access for Every Woman’s Evelyn Griesse. “If the ban takes effect, more women will need to go out of state and won’t be able to afford it, including those that have a job.  At the same time, we’ve had a positive response from donors – people have called from as far away as Philadelphia and Oregon asking how they can help.”  

<p>The National Reproductive Justice Fund will also assist women facing other extreme obstacles, including women in the eight other states that have similar abortion ban legislation pending – Alabama, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Missouri, Ohio, Oklahoma, and Tennessee. Poggi noted that “as with South Dakota, in these states low-income women will be most affected.”  People seeking to donate to the National Reproductive Justice Fund can contact NNAF at 617 524 6040 or www.nnaf.org. 

<p><i>The National Network of Abortion Funds (NNAF) is a coalition of 108 community-based groups in 43 states that offer financial assistance to low-income women seeking abortions.  Each year, the Network raises over $2 million and helps more than 20,000 women and girls nationwide, but we cannot meet the entire need.  NNAF provides support and training to its member Funds and advocates for a humane future where public funding of abortion – and all reproductive healthcare – is a reality.</i><!-- #EndEditable -->
