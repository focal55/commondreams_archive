<p>RIO DE JANEIRO   - April 13 - ActionAid International (AAI) is extremely concerned at the government of Nepal’s response to protests organized by the agitating seven-party alliance (SPA). Restricting peaceful demonstrations is a violation of Nepal’s commitments under international law, and is likely to deepen tensions and increase human insecurity.

 

<p>Since 4 April, five protesters have lost their lives, and representatives of the SPA claim that more than 2000 have been wounded and approximately 1500 detained during demonstrations. According to the National Human Rights Commission and the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, the response of the Nepali security forces, including beating and opening fire on protesters, has been disproportionate.

 

<p>AAI has repeatedly pointed out that increasing political confrontation and violence will have huge implications for poor and excluded people in Nepal. Nepal is moving farther and farther away from public accountability, just governance and the fulfillment of human rights, a key position of the Global Call to Action Against Poverty. 

 

<p>AAI believes the government of Nepal should respect people’s right to peaceful assembly and not utilize disproportionate force. The protesting parties should ensure that their movement remains peaceful. 

 

<p>In addition, AAI believes that:

 

<p><b>1) People in Nepal should determine how they are governed. </b>Any system of governance should be rooted in respect for the human rights of people. Such a system should be based on UN principles of good governance and the International Bill of Human Rights. Any system of governance must ensure that people have proper access to justice.

 

<p><b>2) All conflicting groups (the government, political parties and Maoists) and the international community must acknowledge that Nepal is susceptible to a major humanitarian crisis. </b>People should receive humanitarian assistance based not on political factors, but rather on their needs and abilities to cope. Humanitarian agencies should have the right to access populations in need. 

 

<p><b>3) The space for civil society to properly hold the state, private sector and international institutions to account must be protected. </b>Civil society can play a key role in ensuring just and democratic governance, conflict resolution and development.

 

<p><b>4) All violence in Nepal should be denounced.</b>It is the duty of both the security forces and Maoists to respect international law and international human rights standards, even when they are engaged in conflict. During any type of violence, the poor and excluded (particularly women and children) suffer the most because of fewer economic opportunities and greater vulnerability. Thus both the security forces and Maoists should take extra care not to harm these groups.

 

<p><b>5) All conflicting groups must negotiate through dialogue and reach a peaceful solution. Such a solution should focus on structural causes and include the concerns of Nepal’s civil society and private sector, and thus be consensus-orientated.
</b>Neither side can achieve a final military victory in Nepal. Both armed sides should declare a permanent ceasefire. All sides should seriously consider a role for international mediation in the resolution of Nepal’s conflict.

 

<p><b>6) The international community should pay increased attention to Nepal’s situation, and provide the necessary diplomatic and financial support for a just and peaceful resolution of the conflict.

</b>The international community needs to ensure that its actions do not lead to an escalation of violence or suffering. Moreover, conflict resolution will require the involvement of the international community. The international community needs a common approach to resolving the crisis.
