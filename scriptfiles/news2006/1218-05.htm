<p>BOSTON - December 18 - Environmental Defense  praised Massachusetts' officials for taking a strong step forward  today in reducing the public health burden of diesel pollution, by  dedicating $22.5 million to clean up emissions from publicly owned  transit and school buses (see advisory below).  </p>
<p>   Diesel pollution aggravates symptoms of asthma, bronchitis and  other respiratory diseases, and increases the risk of heart  attacks and strokes.  Massachusetts has the highest health risk  from diesel soot in New England. Dirty diesel causes tens of  thousands of lost work days, thousands of asthma attacks, hundreds  of heart attacks and premature deaths annually.  </p>
<p>   "This action to clean up school bus emissions is a winner for  kids, parents and taxpayers in the Commonwealth," said Gwen Ruta,  Massachusetts Regional Director at Environmental Defense and  former director of external affairs for the U.S. Environmental  Protection Agency.  "Every dollar invested in filtering out  pollutants in diesel exhaust yields at least $12 in health  benefits, making this a very cost-effective way to cut air  pollution. This is a great first step toward a comprehensive  solution to dirty diesel."</p>
<p>   Ruta said that the next step s should be to address emissions  from the construction sector by passing House Bill 4719 (see  <a href="http://releases.usnewswire.com/redir.asp?ReleaseID=77750&Link=http://www.mass.gov/legis/bills/house/ht04pdf/ht04719.pdf">http://www.mass.gov/legis/bills/house/ht04pdf/ht04719.pdf</a> ). It targets emissions from construction equipment like backhoes  and cranes that contribute to hot spots of pollution in urban areas  and near construction sites.</p>
<p>   "There are 14 days left in this legislative session," Ruta  added. "The legislature has a chance to take the Administration's  actions one step this year further by cleaning up emissions from  the construction equipment.  This move would give the private  sector the incentives it needs to lead the way, and bring the  cleanest technologies to more diesel fleets now."</p>
<p>   "Massachusetts needs a comprehensive plan for reducing diesel  pollution, and the announcement today is a move in the right  direction," Ruta concluded. "The sooner a comprehensive program is  in place, the sooner we can all start to breathe easier."  </p>
