<p>	DEAD SEA, Jordan - June 13 - Two days ago  a group of prominent women leaders from around the world gathered  in Jordan at the invitation of Queen Rania Al-Abdullah for an  unprecedented meeting to launch the Global Women's Action Network  for Children and to affirm the inextricable link between women,  children and youth and the two goals the Global Women's Action  Network for Children selected for focused and long-term action:  maternal and newborn mortality and girls' education.  Currently,  some 11 million mothers and newborns die from mostly preventable  causes and 100 million children are denied education.  Both are  embodied in the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) adopted by  the United Nations to be achieved by 2015.  At the current rate  of progress, the majority of nations will not meet them, but  together this groundbreaking Network of multi-generational,  multi-sector, multi-racial, multi-faith women that knows no  geographic boundary has pledged to change that outcome.</p>
<p>   Today as the conference concludes, this Network of women are  united in their commitment, drive, and willingness to use their  power and resources to save the lives of mothers and children and  invest in the potential of all of our children.   Each pledged to  do her part to make it clear that these issues are a top concern  of women, and that they should be a top concern of Government  leaders, investors, decision and policy makers around the world  and that as the Network they will engage Government, grassroots  networks, philanthropic and policy institutions in this cause. </p>
<p>   Addressing the closing ceremonies, conference co-convener and  Children's Defense Fund President Marian Wright Edelman said, "We  know from this conference the hope we can bring, the dreams we  can salvage, the knowledge we can share, the successful policies  and practices we can scale up, the power we can multiply and the  wills we can build by uniting our demands for justice for the  voiceless through collaborative action steps and a strategic,  long term action plan."</p>
<p>   Queen Rania Al-Abdullah officially closed the conference by  saying, "By speaking for those whom the world cannot hear, we  will echo their stories in the halls of power and bring about  change. By engaging today's young girls and showing them the  power they have within, we will help save the next generation of  at-risk mothers and babies ... So as you head home, let us  remember ... that to the world, each of us may be just one woman,  we may be the world."</p>
<p>   Developing the Action Plan</p>
<p>   The Conferees also agreed on a key set of recommendations that  will be used to develop an action plan.  Conference co-conveners  agreed that they will meet within 30 - 45 days to fully flesh out  the full action plan and a coordinating infrastructure which  ensures its effective implementation and the ongoing advice and  input of key representatives from each region of the world.  It  will be housed at the Children's Defense Fund with dedicated  staff.</p>
<p>   -- Create the urgency for action – Ensure that the  international community can no longer ignore these issues and  mobilize the outrage over the fact that 11 million women and  children to die needlessly each year and 100 million children  lack education into positive action. </p>
<p>   -- Innovation Fund – Envisioned as a new kind of fund that  will focus on advocacy and effectively harness and utilize the  network's human capital, its ability to drive in-kind resources  and engage in advocacy to influence and hold leaders, decision  makers and investors accountable on these issues. The fund would  also be used as a means to effectively focus resources on and  showcase best practices and model projects with clear, data- driven assessments of the effectiveness of these projects.   Additionally the fund will steer resources towards helping to  scale up innovative projects. </p>
<p>   -- Identify Target Projects - The Network will target two or  three nations to accelerate the rate of progress on our two goals  through a range of advocacy, leadership and community capacity  building strategies and infrastructure development.  Within 90  days, we will select these nations based on a set of criteria  which include need, readiness and will for change and the  likelihood of success drawing on all available research. </p>
<p>   -- Strike Force/Leadership Development – Each member of the  Network is committed to engaging and activating their individual  networks around these issues, and to develop leadership capacity  within their networks, especially among younger women. The  Network will also seek to amplify the voices of women and others  not yet engaged in these issues across all sectors. The Network  will also deploy "value added" resources geographically or when  an issue arises that impacts these issues. </p>
<p>   -- Accountability – The Network will work to ensure  accountability among key decision makers, policy makers and  investors in Government, Philanthropic and private sectors.  They  will monitor the commitments from developed nations -- especially  the United States -- and holding them accountable for  appropriating promised resources, and encouraging monitoring of  actions in all nations for measurable results on mothers and  children's health and quality education for girls.  The Network  also pledged to hold one another accountable to achieving their  goals.</p>
<p>   -- Communications Plan/Develop a Specific Campaign - The  Network seeks to employ strategies to galvanize the public,  grassroots and the international communities to take action. They  will develop and mount a clear, sustained actionable  communications and public awareness campaign to make and keep  visible the preventable mortality, morbidity and illiteracy of  mothers and children around the globe.   The Network will also  increase the understanding, commitment, passion and sisterhood  among prominent women committed to stand for powerless women and  children through Maternal and Child Health and Education Watches,  annual Interfaith Days of Prayer and other opportunities to  celebrate important milestones and mothers and children together  globally.</p>
<p>   -- Develop a Web site/Knowledge Bank of Best Practices - The  Network will establish a Global Women's Action Network for  Children interactive website which will provide up-to-date  information on best practices, current and relevant research in a  user friendly form, and a calendar of important global and  national events and conferences and Network activities so that  our message and messengers can be dispatched to engage others.   The goal in part is to end the redundancies and more effectively  target time and resources toward what works, developing and  promoting best practices, but also engage in real research to  track progress and success.</p>
<p>   The Children's Defense Fund will launch the Global Women's  Action Network for Children Web site by the end of September.  </p>
