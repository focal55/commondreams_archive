<p> MINNEAPOLIS, Minnesota - June 14 - Gun violence  prevention leaders in Minnesota today joined with leaders of the  Children's Defense Fund in urging more public attention on the  devastating cost of gun violence on America's children.</p>
<p>   On Tuesday, the Children's Defense Fund released their annual  report on gun violence and young Americans.  Citing the most  recent data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and  Prevention, the report reveals that 2,827 children and teens died  as a result of gun violence in 2003 – more than the number of  American fighting men and women killed in hostile action in Iraq  from 2003 to April 2006.</p>
<p>   &quot;The pain and devastation caused by losing a child to  senseless gun violence is unspeakable,&quot; said Doris Bluntson,  Director of Mothers of Crime Victims, whose 15-year-old son,  Michael, was shot and killed earlier this year. &quot;My child I  carried inside of me and nurtured for 15 years is no more... My  life has changed.  I have to learn to live without my son. No  mother should be subject to such misery.</p>
<p>   Minneapolis activists discussed the report this morning, and  activists in Duluth will continue focusing attention on the  crisis tomorrow, when they gather at 3:45 p.m. at the Memorial  Bell Garden at Lake Place Park.  They will be participating in a  &quot;Walk for Peace&quot; event starting at 4 PM sponsored by the Duluth  Arts Commission which will stop at the Bell Garden for a history  of the garden and a bell ringing in memory of the eight children  who on average die from gun violence every day in America.</p>
<p>   Nationally, more and more attention is being focused on the  gun violence epidemic. More than 40 American Mayors, including  Minneapolis Mayor J.T. Rybak, have banded together to demand  tougher gun laws to fight the scourge of guns pouring from the  legal into the illegal market and causing cities like the Twin  Cities to see rising gun violence.</p>
<p>   Andrew Kiragu, a pediatric ICU physician and the medical  director of the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit at Hennepin County  Medical Center, joined with the leaders who gathered at Elliott  Park on Minneapolis' East 14th Street. Kiragu, an Assistant  Professor of Pediatrics at the University of Minnesota Medical  School, is the principal investigator for the Injury Free  Coalition for Kids of Minneapolis at HCMC.</p>
<p>   &quot;I have cared for children that have sustained gunshot wounds,  and have seen first-hand the effects of these injuries on the  children and their families,&quot; Kiragu said.</p>
<p>   &quot;Minnesota parents are tired of hearing about Minnesota  children who never make it to adulthood,&quot; said Sue Fust,  Executive Director, Citizens for a Safer Minnesota.  &quot;We know how  to keep guns from getting into the hands of criminals –- and we  need to take action.&quot;</p>
<p>   The Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence in March announced  a new focus on stopping illegal gun trafficking that focuses on  three specific steps that could radically impact illegal gun  trafficking.  Partnering with state-based groups like CSM, the  organization will work for three key reforms at the state and  Federal level, which will shut down sources of illegal guns  without interfering with legal gun ownership:</p>
<p>   -- Strengthen law enforcement tools to crack down on corrupt  gun dealers.  Congress needs to repeal irrational legal  constraints that have reduced ATF's effectiveness in enforcing  the law against dealers who feed the illegal market.  And state  legislatures and local governments need to give state and local  law enforcement new tools to combat gun trafficking.</p>
<p>   -- Extend Brady Background checks to all gun sales.  Since the  enactment of the Brady Bill over 10 years ago, more than 1.3  million felons and other prohibited purchasers have been blocked  from buying guns from licensed gun dealers.  Brady background  checks must now be extended to all gun sales, wherever they  occur.  Our national policy should be no background check, no  sale, no excuses.</p>
<p>   -- Stop large volume gun sales that supply traffickers.  It is  possible in most states for &quot;straw purchasers&quot; and traffickers to  buy unlimited numbers of guns to sell to the illegal market.   This must stop.</p>
