<p>MISSOULA, Montana - November 10 - Tuesday was a very good day for progressives. 
Voters put progressives in Governor's mansions, attorneys general races, 
secretary of state offices, and legislative chambers. Most Progressive ballot 
measures advanced. Conservative ballot measures got trounced.
<P class=MsoNormal>&quot;We're back,&quot; says Progressive States co-chair Steve Doherty, 
the former minority leader of the Montana Senate. &quot;Our message talks directly to 
people at their kitchen tables, over the back fences. It's talking about wages 
and access to health care and those issues are going to bring us back."</P>
<P class=MsoNormal>Doherty related that message in a post-election conference 
call with legislators, journalists, bloggers, and activists from across the 
country. He was joined by PSN executive director Joel Barkin and policy director 
Nathan Newman, as well as Lisa Seitz Gruwell, an experienced state-level 
political operative and chief operating officer of Skyline Public Works, and 
journalist Christopher Hayes.</P>
<P class=MsoNormal>The overwhelming theme of the conversation? State elections 
prove that progressive policy priorities &#8211; even beyond the Iraq War &#8211; are 
connecting with American voters, even as conservative messages are utterly 
failing.</P>
<P class=MsoNormal>Hayes noted that two of the biggest determining factors in 
the election &#8211; Iraq and corruption &#8211; were less likely to affect state races, as 
state candidates have little ability to impact foreign policy and corruption in 
the states is less partisan of an issue than it has been in Washington. Thus, 
analyzing the state results is a useful way of analyzing the domestic policy 
desires of the country: "In terms of teasing out what this election was about, 
the state results are a strong data point in favor of the fact that [É] there 
was a kind of philosophical shift among the electorate and it wasn't just a 
referendum on the war."</P>
<P class=MsoNormal>Gruwell rattled off an explanation of major Democratic 
pick-ups in statewide offices and legislative chambers, noting that no chamber 
in the country saw the defeat of more than two Democrats. Democrats now control 
"the trifecta" &#8211; both legislative chambers and the Governor's office &#8211; in 15 
states, compared to just 10 for the Republicans. She also specifically noted 
that heightened youth turnout, with young people voting overwhelmingly for 
change, was a key factor in the victory.</P>
<P class=MsoNormal>Even these victories understate the extent of the progressive 
victory on Tuesday. According to Joel Barkin, "Even where Republicans did win, 
many of these Republicans were actually running on, in some cases, very 
progressive platforms" citing Governors Arnold Schwarzenegger of California and 
Jodi Rell of Connecticut as examples.</P>
<P class=MsoNormal>In fact, conservative messages utterly failed, not just among 
candidates, but when voters were simply given a clear policy choice. A tax 
revolt utterly failed to materialize when anti-taxing-and-spending measures went 
down to defeat everywhere they were on the ballot.</P>
<P class=MsoNormal>"One of the most dramatic parts of what happened was this 
almost complete collapse of many of the rightwing ballot initiative campaigns, 
especially those coming out of the tax revolt wing of the party," said Nathan 
Newman.</P>
<P class=MsoNormal><B>Key Election Stats:</B></P>
<UL style="MARGIN-TOP: 0in" type=disc>
  <LI class=MsoNormal style="tab-stops: list .5in">Democrats picked up six 
  Governors' seats, leaving 28 Democratic Governors and 22 Republican Governors. 

  <LI class=MsoNormal style="tab-stops: list .5in">Democrats won three net 
  Secretary of State seats. Republicans won three seats. Democrats won four. 
  Incoming Governors in Maryland and New York will appoint new Secretaries of 
  State, assumedly Democrats. That will leave the nation with 27 Democratic 
  Secretaries and 23 Republican. 
  <LI class=MsoNormal style="tab-stops: list .5in">Democrats already had a large 
  lead among Attorneys General, with 29 of the 50 states. Democrats won seats in 
  Kansas, Nevada, and Ohio on election day, losing Wisconsin, leaving the 
  balance at 31 Democratic Attorneys General and 19 Republican. 
  <LI class=MsoNormal style="tab-stops: list .5in">Democrats now control a 
  majority of state legislative seats nationwide. At most recent count (from the 
  National Conference of State Legislatures), Democrats controlled 3,986 seats 
  to the Republicans' 3,323 &#8211; a net gain of 321 seats. Democrats now control 
  both chambers in 23 states, up from 19. Republicans control both chambers in 
  15 states, down from 20. </LI></UL>
<P class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</P>
<P class=MsoNormal><B>Key Ballot Issue Results:</B></P>
<UL style="MARGIN-TOP: 0in" type=disc>
  <LI class=MsoNormal style="tab-stops: list .5in">The minimum wage was hugely 
  popular, winning in all six states where it was considered. 
  <LI class=MsoNormal style="tab-stops: list .5in">Health care issues proved 
  popular, with Missouri approving its stem cell initiative, Oregon approving an 
  expansion of its prescription drug program, and tobacco tax increases faring 
  well in several states. 
  <LI class=MsoNormal style="tab-stops: list .5in">Rightwing tax-and-spending 
  initiatives failed in all six states where they were put on the ballot, 
  indicating a rejection of the rightwing tax narrative. 
  <LI class=MsoNormal style="tab-stops: list .5in">Arizona became the first 
  state to reject a same-sex marriage ban. Seven other states passed bans, but 
  Wisconsin conservatives now blame the measure for unexpected statehouse 
  setbacks. 
  <LI class=MsoNormal style="tab-stops: list .5in">Kelo reform was popular, 
  regulatory takings are not. Eight states passed Kelo/eminent domaint reform. 
  Three states rejected regulatory takings measures. Only one (in Arizona) 
  passed. 
  <LI class=MsoNormal style="tab-stops: list .5in">Rhode Island voters extended 
  voting rights to felons upon release from prison. 
  <LI class=MsoNormal style="tab-stops: list .5in">Voters indicated ballot issue 
  fatigue, voting down 60% of ballot measures, including some great progressive 
  measures that may have failed due to voter unfamiliarity with the central 
  premise, including Massachusetts' fusion voting measure and Arizona's 
  vote-by-mail initiative. </LI></UL>
