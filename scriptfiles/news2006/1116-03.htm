<p>WASHINGTON - November 16 - The Sierra Club today released its second annual "Guide to America’s Best New Development" featuring ten ground-breaking projects that help keep our drinking water clean. Better known for its efforts to combat sprawling construction, the group is making the point that there is a better way to build and produce healthy and livable communities. 

<p>Profiles of the winning projects can be viewed at: <a href="http://www.sierraclub.org/buildingbetter">www.sierraclub.org/buildingbetter</a>
<p>"Everyone deserves clean drinking water," said the Sierra Club’s Executive Director Carl Pope. "That’s why it is heartening to see developers taking action to protect our water. By implementing simple solutions to curb the huge amount of pollution generated by their projects, these cost-effective developments are helping create truly livable communities. Our hope is that Americans will look at these inventive projects and demand better clean water practices as their own communities grow and develop." 

<p>The Sierra Club applauded a diverse set of projects taken on by developers, communities, local utilities and even nuns. They involve solutions both big and small, from rain gardens and natural plantings in Seattle to re-creating wetlands at a Motherhouse in Monroe and a giant underground cistern at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. By incorporating creative methods for managing polluted stormwater runoff these projects help keep sewage, toxics and litter out of our water. 

<p>Polluted runoff and sewage overflows are the largest sources of water pollution and growing threats to the health of our water, so in choosing projects to be recognized with this year’s top development honors the Sierra Club looked for simple, but highly effective solutions that help keep untreated and poorly treated sewage and toxic urban runoff out of our drinking water sources. All of the projects highlighted in this report use simple solutions that can be easily replicated across the country and that have been proven to help keep our water clean by reducing the volume and impact of stormwater runoff. 

<p>"The most important factor in all of these projects is that the designers looked at stormwater as a resource, not a waste product," explained Sierra Club development analyst Eric Olson. "By changing that perspective not only can these projects reap a host of benefits- both economic and environmental, but so can the surrounding communities."
