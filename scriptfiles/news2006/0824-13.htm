<p>WASHINGTON - August 24 - The American 
Civil Liberties Union today said the decision by the Food and Drug 
Administration to allow pharmacies to sell emergency contraception -- also known 
as Plan B or the &#8220;morning after&#8221; pill -- without a prescription to women 18 and 
over was a step in the right direction. The ACLU warned, however, that the 
arbitrary age restriction not only infringes on privacy rights but also will 
deter women of all ages from purchasing emergency contraception. </P>
<P>&#8220;The FDA&#8217;s decision to make emergency contraception available 
without a prescription is long overdue,&#8221; said Caroline Fredrickson, Director of 
the ACLU Washington Legislative Office. &#8220;Unfortunately, the decision is coupled 
with an arbitrary age requirement, unsupported by scientific evidence, that will 
invade the privacy of women. We hope the FDA will re-examine this unwise 
restriction.&#8221;</P>
<P>In May 2004, the FDA denied over-the-counter (OTC) status to 
the emergency contraceptive, Plan B, disregarding the near-unanimous 
recommendation of an FDA expert advisory panel to allow the drug to be sold 
without a prescription. FDA staff, the American College of Obstetricians and 
Gynecologists, the American Public Health Association and other medical 
organizations also supported the recommendation.</P>
<P>In concluding that emergency contraceptives are safe and 
effective, the FDA advisory panel considered a study showing that better access 
to such contraceptives does not cause adolescents to have more unprotected sex 
or to stop using contraception. Other recently released studies further support 
this conclusion.</P>
<P>Following the 2004 denial, and in response to FDA concerns 
about teenagers&#8217; access to the contraceptive, the company that manufactures Plan 
B reapplied for OTC status for women 16 and 
older. In 
2005, the FDA twice announced that it would indefinitely delay issuing a 
decision on the application. Today&#8217;s announcement makes Plan B available as an 
OTC medication, but arbitrarily restricted to women 18 and older.</P>
<P>Emergency contraception reduces the risk of pregnancy by as 
much as 89 percent if the first dose is taken within days of unprotected 
intercourse, but it is more effective the sooner it is taken. Ready access to 
emergency contraception is critical for all sexually active women, , the ACLU 
said.</P>
<P>Following today&#8217;s announcement, pharmacies that sell 
emergency contraception will be forced to impose mandatory proof-of-age 
requirements on all women purchasing the drug. Said Fredrickson, &#8220;Such 
requirements will serve only to humiliate a woman who has just experienced 
contraceptive failure, unprotected sex, or sexual assault.&#8221;</P><!-- #EndEditable -->
