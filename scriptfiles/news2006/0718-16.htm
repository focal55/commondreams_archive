<p>WASHINGTON - July 18 - 
The Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS) will release a survey of nearly one thousand Food and Drug Administration (FDA) scientists that demonstrates widespread and dangerous political and commercial interference at the agency. Because the FDA regulates many products including food, drugs, vaccines, medical devices and cosmetics, these findings have implications for every American. FDA scientists report being asked to alter their findings for non-scientific reasons, experiencing inappropriate commercial influences on their work, and being afraid to publicly express concerns about public health for fear of retaliation. Speakers at the press conference will include a former FDA scientist, a private citizen who has lost a family member due to a dangerous anti-depressant, and the director of UCS's Scientific Integrity Program. This will be the third survey of scientists at federal agencies UCS has released.

<p><b>WHEN:</b>

Noon EST, Thursday, July 20 (Light lunch will be available)

<p><b>WHERE:</b>

National Press Club, Murrow Room, 529 14th St. NW, Washington D.C.

<p><b>SPEAKERS:</b>

Dr. Francesca Grifo, senior scientist and director, Scientific Integrity Program, Union of Concerned Scientists
<p> Dr. Susan Wood, former director of the Office of Women's Health, Food and Drug Administration. Currently research professor in the department of Environmental and Occupational Health at the George Washington University School of Public Health and Health Services. 
<p> Kim Witczak, <a href="http://www.WoodyMatters.com" target="_new">WoodyMatters.com</a>, lost husband due to side effects of a dangerous anti-depressant
