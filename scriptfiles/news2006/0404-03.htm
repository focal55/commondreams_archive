WASHINGTON, April 4 /U.S. Newswire/ -- The following statement was released today by Media Matters for America regarding their analysis of Sunday morning talk shows:
<p>   Six weeks ago, Media Matters for America published an in-depth study of guests on ABC's This Week, CBS' Face the Nation, and NBC's Meet the Press in which we demonstrated that the shows' Republican and conservative guests outnumbered Democratic and progressive guests over a nine-year period. The study, titled &quot;If It's Sunday, It's Conservative: An analysis of the Sunday talk show guests on ABC, CBS, and NBC, 1997-2005,&quot; received a spate of media coverage from outlets across the nation and around the world, including The Nation, CBS Public Eye, Broadcasting &amp; Cable, CNN Radio, and NPR's On the Media. </p>

<p>   Yet despite the media attention focused on our findings, Meet the Press host Tim Russert, Face the Nation host Bob Schieffer, and This Week host George Stephanopoulos continued to play host to a preponderance of Republican and conservative guests during the first three months of 2006. On Sunday mornings during the first quarter of this year, Republican and conservative dominance continued unabated, as those from the right outnumbered Democrats and their progressive compatriots.</p>
<p>   Overall, there were 75 appearances by Republicans/conservatives during this time period, but only 50 by Democrats/progressives. If we remove the neutrals (a category that includes guests who are centrist or nonpartisan) to examine only those with a clearly identifiable ideology, we see that the imbalance has been, if anything, slightly more acute in 2006 than it was in the years 1997 through 2005.</p>
<p>   All three Sunday-morning shows granted more solo interviews to Republicans than Democrats. In this respect, Meet the Press was particularly extreme. While This Week and Face the Nation both gave slightly more solo interviews to Republicans than Democrats, the disparity on Meet the Press was striking: nine solo interviews with Republicans over the three-month period, but only two solo interviews with Democrats.</p>
<p>   As we noted in our original study, we do not assert that every show must be precisely balanced between the left and the right. Over time, however, one would expect something like parity between the two sides to emerge. While the failure to balance the right and the left is particularly acute on NBC's Meet the Press, it persists on all three networks. </p>
<p>   In 2006, Sunday mornings on network television have been dominated by conservatives to the same extent as they had been in the preceding nine years. Media Matters for America once again asks the producers of ABC's This Week, CBS' Face the Nation, and NBC's Meet the Press to consider whether this pattern of conservative domination serves the public interest.</p>
<p>   The complete Media Matters analysis can be found here: <a href="http://releases.usnewswire.com/redir.asp?ReleaseID=63499&Link=http://mediamatters.org/items/200604040001">http://mediamatters.org/items/200604040001</a>.</p>
