WASHINGTON - March 21 – Religious leaders in Pennsylvania should be wary of a new political organizing effort that appears to be little more than a thinly veiled push to help re-elect U.S. Sen. Rick Santorum (R-Pa.), says Americans United for Separation of Church and State.
<p>Details about the new drive, spearheaded by the group Let Freedom Ring, appear in today&#8217;s <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/21/politics/21churches.html?ex=1143608400&en=5023946f2cfc4fb9&ei=5070&emc=eta1" target="_blank"><em>New York Times</em></a>. The newspaper noted that a March 6 organizing event by the group featured a video appearance by Santorum but not his Democratic opponent or any other candidates. Following the presentation, organizer Colin A. Hanna praised Santorum and recommended his book <em>It Takes a Family</em>.</p>

<p>The so-called Pennsylvania Pastors Network claims to be an issue-oriented public policy organization, but critics assert that the real goal is to help Santorum, who faces a tough re-election bid this year. The group has announced it will hire 10 full-time &#8220;field directors&#8221; in the state  a huge number for a mere public policy effort.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is an under-the-radar campaign to re-elect Santorum,&#8221; said the Rev. Barry W. Lynn, executive director of Americans United. &#8220;Pennsylvania pastors are being misled, and they need to be very careful. The Internal Revenue Service is watching carefully for violations of federal tax law this year.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lynn noted that <a href="http://www.irs.gov/newsroom/article/0,,id=154780,00.html" target="_blank">the Internal Revenue Service recently announced</a> that it will vigorously enforce the &#8220;no-politicking&#8221; rule for churches and other tax-exempt entities during this election cycle.</p>

<p>Lynn, an ordained minister as well as an attorney, said Let Freedom Ring is a 501(c)(4) organization, which means it may legally intervene in political campaigns. Houses of worship, by contrast, are 501(c)(3) groups and are flatly barred from partisan political intervention.</p>

<p>During the March 6 event, one speaker, the Rev. Frank Pavone of Priests for Life, discussed the importance of President George W. Bush having a favorable Senate so that he can continue to change the composition of the Supreme Court.</p>

<p>Let Freedom Ring&#8217;s activities are heavily financed by multi-millionaire John Templeton Jr., a Pennsylvania doctor who is a well known supporter of Republican candidates.</p>

<p>&#8220;Voter registration drives are fine,&#8221; said Lynn. &#8220;But the Pennsylvania Pastors Network appears to be undertaking this effort with the aim of helping Sen. Santorum retain his seat. Churches that get involved are putting their tax-exempt status at risk.&#8221;</p>

<p id=aboutau>Americans United is a religious liberty watchdog group based in Washington, D.C. Founded in 1947, the organization educates Americans about the importance of church-state separation in safeguarding religious freedom.</p>
