<p>WASHINGTON - September 6 - A new report by the  Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence reveals how Philadelphia- area gun dealer Lou's Jewelry and Loan sold guns used in crime  for over two decades, and repeatedly sold guns to gun traffickers  and their straw purchasers, yet its gun business was not shut  down by federal law enforcement authorities until this summer,  when the ATF announced that it had found that Lou's had committed  &quot;numerous and egregious violations of the Gun Control Act.&quot;</p>
<p>   Two bills, H.R. 5005 and 5092, which the House Judiciary  Committee has scheduled a vote on tomorrow, Sept. 7, would  protect rogue dealers and make it even more difficult for ATF to  shut them down.</p>
<p>   Drawing on exclusive interviews obtained by the Brady Center  with a former gun trafficker who, by his own account and  according to court records, purchased numerous guns from Lou's, a  former employee of Lou's, and law enforcement officials, &quot;Lethal  Lou's&quot; chronicles how for years the shop sold guns to gun  traffickers and straw purchasers, including Saad Abdul Salaam,  who supplied a co-conspirator in the 1993 World Trade Center  bombing.</p>
<p>   Though current laws greatly restrict ATF's ability to shut  down scofflaw dealers, Congress is now considering passing NRA- backed legislation that would make it even more difficult for ATF  to revoke the licenses of dealers like Lou's, and would shield  their sales of crime guns from disclosure to the public and local  law enforcement.</p>
<p>   Lou's Loan of Upper Darby, Pa., lost its federal license to  sell guns on July 31.  The shop's long history of misconduct  provides powerful evidence of the weakness in current federal law  regulating gun dealers, allowing cities like Philadelphia to be  victimized by illegal guns for decades.</p>
<p>   The gun lobby, and those in Congress who cater to it, are  pushing legislation, H.R. 5092, as part of the &quot;American Values  Agenda&quot; announced by House Republican leaders, which would gut  ATF's already limited powers to take away the licenses of rogue  gun dealers.  Another bill before Congress, H.R. 5005, would bar  the public -- and even local law enforcement -- from learning the  truth about which dealers are supplying guns used in crime.   Tomorrow, Sept. 7, the House Judiciary Committee is scheduled to  vote on whether to send these bills to the House floor.</p>
<p>   &quot;It is outrageous that Congress would coddle gun dealers like  Lou's,&quot; said Elizabeth S. Haile, staff attorney at the Brady  Center to Prevent Gun Violence's Legal Action Project, which  serves as co-counsel for the family of 14-year-old Anthony Oliver  in a lawsuit alleging that Lou's negligently sold the gun used to  kill him.  &quot;If the NRA's bill were the law today, Lou's would be  open for business for years to come.  Congress should crack down  on rogue gun sellers instead of caving in to the NRA.&quot;</p>
<p>   &quot;Lethal Lou's&quot; is the latest in a series of Brady Center  reports exposing the record of reckless gun dealers who have  profited from the supply of firearms to criminals.  A report  issued in June, &quot;Death Valley,&quot; profiled Baltimore gun dealer  Valley Guns, owned by NRA Board Member Sanford Abrams, that had  committed over 900 violations of federal law.  All of the reports  can be accessed at www.bradycenter.org/gunindustrywatch  Gun  Industry Watch is a comprehensive research effort of the Brady  Center to monitor the gun industry and expose industry practices  that endanger innocent lives.</p>
