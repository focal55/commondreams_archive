<p>WASHINGTON - March 24 - World Wildlife Fund  today praised a surprise decision by the government of the  Malaysian state of Sabah to protect its most important remaining  lowland forests on the island of Borneo.  This decision will  permanently preserve one of just two places in the world where  the endangered orangutans, Bornean Pygmy elephants and the  critically endangered Sumatran rhino co-exist and where forests  are still large enough to maintain viable populations of each.</p>
<p>   The plan, long sought by conservationists, places three forest  reserves, which cover an area the size of Rhode Island, under  sustainable forest management.  Large-scale timber harvesting  would end by 2007 and be replaced with sustainable forest  management practices.  </p>
<p>   &quot;This is one of the most important actions ever taken to  secure the future of Borneo's endangered wild mammals,&quot; said  Carter Roberts, CEO and President of Word Wildlife Fund - U.S.   &quot;We applaud the commitment by the Sabah State Cabinet and we look  forward to working with the Malaysian government to make this  commitment a reality.&quot;</p>
<p>   The decision covers the entire Ulu Segama and Malua Forest  Reserves, which are priority areas for WWF and part of the Heart  of Borneo program.  Borneo contains some of the most biologically  diverse habitats on earth that contain a staggeringly high  numbers of unique species across all groups of plants and  animals. </p>
<p>   Foregoing large-scale logging will cost the Sabah state  economy about $270 million in the short-term.  But the government  expects the preserved forests will render at least three times  that amount over the long-term.  </p>
<p>   &quot;The Sabah State Cabinet has shown tremendous foresight in  making this decision,&quot; said Ginette Hemley, WWF's Vice President  for Species Conservation.  &quot;If done right -- and we still have a  long way to go -- these forests will always be a home for some of  the most critically endangered animals in the world while still  contributing in a very significant way to the Malaysian economy.&quot;</p>
<p>   WWF will work with the Sabah state government to create a  management plan for the new reserves, identify restoration needs,  conduct detailed species surveys and support enforcement and  anti-poaching brigades.  Poaching, deforestation and illegal  trafficking are the biggest threats to rhinos, elephants and  orangutans in Borneo.
