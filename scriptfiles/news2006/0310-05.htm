<p> WASHINGTON - March 10 - In just its first  year, WakeUpWalMart.com, America's campaign to change Wal-Mart,  was awarded the prestigious 2006 Golden Dot award for &quot;Best  National Internet Campaign.&quot;  The George Washington University's  Institute for Politics, Democracy &amp; the Internet (IPDI) presents  the annual Golden Dot Awards for excellence in online campaigning  and for outstanding achievement in the use of the Internet as a  political tool. </p>
<p>   &quot;For too long, the American people have been at a disadvantage  fighting back against multi-billion dollar corporations doing the  wrong thing.  The Internet and its grassroots organizing power,  both online and offline, has changed everything.  Now, ordinary  people have the power to join together in unprecedented ways and  numbers to change even the largest corporation in the world,&quot;  said Paul Blank, campaign director for WakeUpWalMart.com.  &quot;On  behalf of our 185,000 supporters, we are honored to receive such  a prestigious award and we will continue to build the most  powerful political movement ever to change Wal-Mart and change  America.&quot;</p>
<p>   In just 11 months, WakeUpWalMart.com has become one of the  fastest growing grassroots movements in America with 185,000  supporters.  The award is a testament to WakeUpWalMart.com's  success in using the Internet to help create a national campaign  to build public and political pressure on Wal-Mart to change into  a responsible corporation.</p>
<p>   WakeUpWalMart.com joins an exclusive club of campaigns to  receive a Golden Dot award.  Past recipients of the Golden Dot  Award for &quot;Best National Internet Campaign&quot; include Bush-Cheney  2004 and Dean for America, and other award winners include Draft  Wesley Clark, Meetup.com and JibJab.com.  In fact, this  represents the third Golden Dot award for the staff of  WakeUpWalMart.com who served in leadership roles at both Dean for  America and the Draft Clark Movement.
