<p>KATHMANDU, NEPAL – April 13 - Thirty-six ActionAid staff members were amongst an estimated  200 people arrested today at approximately 12.00 hours (local time) whilst taking part in a peaceful march at a central Kathmandu location, Maitighar Mandala.  Protesters called  for peace, human rights and democracy in Nepal.

<p>ActionAid International Nepal was one of approximately 60 international and national non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and civil society organisations taking part in this march.  Dr. Shibesh Chandra Regmi, Country Director of ActionAid International Nepal and the Chair of International NGO Alliance in Nepal, was amongst those arrested.  

<p>As he was arrested Dr. Regmi said: “We have got no political agenda. We decided to express our concerns since ActionAid development work has been affected badly due to the prolonged conflict”.

<p>This follows the arrest and injury of lawyers during a demonstration by the Bar Association of Nepal held in Kathmandu earlier today.
