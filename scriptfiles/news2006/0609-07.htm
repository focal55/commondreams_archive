<p>DORSET, Vermont / GIA LAI PROVINCE, Vietnam - June 9 - Three children were killed this week and three others 
injured when they discovered a baseball-sized cluster bomb left over from the US-Vietnam war and 
played with it as if it were a toy. The children, ranging in ages from two to 
eleven years old, found the cluster bomb in a river near their homes in Vietnam’s 
central highlands and attempted to remove the BB-like pellets on the outside of the 
bomb casing. 

<p>The resulting explosion killed three children, aged six, nine and eleven years old, 
immediately and three others remain hospitalized. 

<p>Although the Vietnam War ended over 30 years ago, by some estimates over 350,000 
tons of bombs that did not detonate when dropped remain in the ground. Since the 
conflict ended in 1975, nearly 40,000 Vietnamese have been killed by these devices 
and thousands more have been injured. 

<p>Clear Path International serves landmine and bomb accident survivors, their 
families and their communities in former war zones in Southeast Asia. This 
assistance takes the form of both direct and indirect medical and social services 
to survivor families as well as equipment support to hospitals. Current Clear Path 
projects are in Vietnam, Cambodia and on the Thai-Burma border. 
More information about Clear Path International can be found on the web at
