<p>WASHINGTON - July 24 - In the wake of recent court rulings against fairness, the Human Rights Campaign 
Foundation today launched a new online resource, &ldquo;Justice for All: The Importance of a Fair and Balanced Judiciary to the Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual and Transgender Community.&rdquo; The&nbsp;<A href="http://www.hrc.org/justice" target="_new">new tool</A>, funded by a grant from the Open Society Institute, educates visitors on why fair-minded judges are important in the fight for equality and how attacks on the courts are attacks on justice. It is part of a program that will also include resources for educators to teach about the importance of the courts.
<p>&ldquo;The courts have always had &mdash; and always should have &mdash; a vital role in ensuring justice for all,&rdquo; said Human Rights Campaign President Joe Solmonese. &ldquo;Attacks on the courts are attacks on any American who values fairness. Our &lsquo;Justice for All&rsquo; tool lays out what&rsquo;s going on as judges fight to keep the independence that&rsquo;s so fundamental to being able to do their jobs
<p>The &ldquo;<A href="http://www.hrc.org/justice" target="_new">Justice for All</A>&rdquo; pages also include a way to sign up for e-mail newsletters, regularly updated information on attacks on the court, interactive games and information about the educational resources under development.
<p>The Human Rights Campaign Foundation&rsquo;s &ldquo;Justice for All&rdquo; program houses this resource. Future resources will include a curriculum, facilitator&rsquo;s guide and corresponding DVD for those interested in teaching this information to a range of age groups.
