<p>WASHINGTON - July 3 - MoveOn's director, Eli Pariser, criticized Connecticut’s U.S. Senator Joseph Lieberman today for announcing his intention to place his name on the November ballot as an independent in case he loses the Democratic primary on August 8 to challenger Ned Lamont.

<p>MoveOn.org's members in Connecticut voted overwhelmingly to endorse Lamont in the organization’s recent on-line primary.

<p>Lieberman is facing a stiff challenge by Lamont, a Greenwich businessman, who entered the race in reaction to the incumbent's support for the Bush Administration’s domestic and foreign policy failures, particularly the ongoing occupation of Iraq. While Lamont trails Lieberman in recent polls, he has been gaining on the incumbent steadily since he announced his candidacy.

<p>"This decision reeks of arrogance: Joe Lieberman is holding himself above the democratic process by which his party chooses its candidates. But clearly he's reading the writing on the wall: Connecticut wants bold leaders who will stand up and fight on big issues like energy and Iraq -- not ones who would accommodate a failed President," said Pariser.

<p>"It's good news for democracy, too: the era in which a cabal of consultants choose which candidates run as Democrats is ending, and rank-and-file Democrats and progressives are being heard," he concluded.
