<p>WASHINGTON - October 13 - The following is a  statement from WakeUpWalMart.com on Wal-Mart's decision to target  Democrats in the 2006 midterm elections, as reported by the  Minneapolis Star Tribune:</p>
<p>   Today's Star Tribune reports, &quot;The world's largest retailer is  about to take the unusual step of distributing information about  specific candidates to its 1.3 million employees nationwide,  according to a company official. …Wal-Mart said it will  specifically target local, state and national leaders who  appeared this summer at a series of anti-Wal-Mart rallies  organized by WakeUpWalMart.com, a union-backed group that has  called on the retailer to offer workers better pay and benefits.&quot;</p>
<p>   The following statement is attributable to Paul Blank,  campaign director for WakeUpWalMart.com:</p>
<p>   &quot;Rather than embrace our positive vision for a better America,  Wal-Mart has officially declared war on the Democratic Party,  elected leaders, and every American who believes we should pay  workers a living wage, provide affordable health care to all,  protect American jobs and keep America safe.</p>
<p>   Even though an overwhelming majority of Americans, including  Democrats, Republicans and Independents, now reject President  Bush's right-wing agenda that has brought us a culture of  corruption, repeated scandals, shipped American jobs overseas and  even jeopardized our national security, Wal-Mart is launching a  political campaign to help keep President Bush in power by trying  to defeat Democrats who called on Wal-Mart to be a more  responsible employer.</p>
<p>   From this day forward, no citizen, regardless of their party  affiliation, should doubt how right-wing Wal-Mart's agenda really  is.  By opposing expanding health care to hard working families  and their children, opposing a living wage of $10 per hour,  lobbying to ship American jobs to China, and even lobbying  against strengthening America's national security, Wal-Mart's  agenda is extreme, misguided, and wrong for America.  It is an  agenda that no American could support, jeopardizes the future of  our country, and is one of the key reasons why Wal-Mart's public  image continues to collapse.</p>
<p>   On behalf of the American people, we are not going to allow  big corporations like Wal-Mart to take America in the wrong  direction.  In that spirit, WakeUpWalMart.com, with the help of  276,000 grassroots supporters, will be announcing a major new  initiative next week that will make it clear to Wal-Mart and its  right wing operatives that our movement will never stop fighting  until the day Wal-Mart truly changes for the better.&quot;</p>
