<p>WASHINGTON - September 11 -
<P>
<b>What:</b> Students at Touro University College of Osteopathic Medicine, joined by officials of the Gay and Lesbian Medical Association (GLMA) and the American Medical Student Association (AMSA), gather to protest Touro University's abolition of the school's several-year-old Gay-Straight Alliance.    <P>
<b>Where:</b> Intersection of Georgia Street and Mare Island Way in Vallejo, CA (50 yards north of Vallejo Ferry Terminal)    <P>
<b>When:</b> Monday, September 11, 2006, 4:30 pm Pacific Time    <P>
The Touro University Gay-Straight Alliance (TUGSA) was created in 2002 with the mission of “promoting equitable health care delivery through awareness and education, and . . . representing diversity both on campus and in medicine." This month, Touro's administration, citing the school's Orthodox Jewish heritage, suddenly revoked the group's charter and rescinded its funding (which had already been approved).    <P>
<b>Gay and Lesbian Medical Association (GLMA)</b>   For 25 years, the Gay and Lesbian Medical Association (GLMA) has worked to ensure equality in health care for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender patients and health professionals. For more information, call 415-255-4547 or visit www.glma.org.
