<p>WASHINGTON - June 13 - Cutting funds to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission 
            (EEOC) is like taking a homeless person's coat in the middle of 
            winter -- making an already bad situation much worse. But cutting 
            funds is exactly what the Bush administration's 2007 budget proposes 
to do.
<P>Who will bear the cold brunt of those cuts? Women, people of 
            color, people with disabilities, religious minorities, seniors -- 
            people for whom the EEOC is often the only source of redress for 
            unlawful discrimination or harassment at work.</P>
            <P>It is unacceptable that wage discrimination against women has 
            persisted for decades, with women working full-time, year-round, 
            currently averaging 77 percent of what men are paid, and women of 
            color making much less. It is inexcusable that in order to fight 
            discrimination, employees are faced with high costs of litigation as 
            well as the likelihood that corporate defendants are financially 
            able to drag their cases on for years. </P>
            <P>We need an EEOC that isn't threadbare -- one that will enforce 
            the protections guaranteed by the Equal Pay Act of 1963 and the 
            Civil Rights Act of 1964. In 2005, 63 percent of the 75,428 filings 
            at EEOC offices were based on race or sex discrimination, including 
            sexual harassment. In the past decade, pregnancy discrimination 
            claims have risen 31 percent. These numbers are indisputable 
            evidence that this country requires a fully resourced and powerful 
            entity that can be trusted with the responsibility to respond to the 
            still-pervasive threats to equality. </P>
            <P>Fighting these threats is crucial -- not only for the protection 
            of the women who make up nearly half of the U.S. workforce -- but 
            also for the economic stability of the country. If wage 
            discrimination against women were eliminated tomorrow, the poverty 
            rate would be cut in half. </P>
            <P>We urge Congress to take leadership in this critical arena, 
            restoring lost jobs and funding, and putting an end to efforts to 
            the Bush administration's efforts to privatize the agency's services 
            and close the area offices that handle a large share of race and sex 
            discrimination charges. </P>
            <P>The paid workforce is still a cold place for women and people of 
            color, and we need the protection of a fully-funded and stable 
            agency to enforce the law. It's only 
      right.</P><!-- #EndEditable -->
