<p>SAN FRANCISCO - October 11 - Responding to public  outrage about soaring college costs, a sharp rise in college loan  interest rates and cuts to federal college aid programs, many  organizations and activists are mobilizing voters across the  nation to make college affordability a critical issue in  November's midterm elections. These organizations represent  millions of students, parents, recent college graduates and  educators.</p>
<p>   Citizen groups around the country are working to increase  dialogue on college affordability and to press candidates to  share their positions on the issue. Groups including the Campaign  for America's Future, the US Student Association, USAction,  Campus Progress at the Center for American Progress and the  National Education Association are releasing reports, launching  online campaigns, communicating with the public and holding  events at college campuses and in hundreds of communities to  raise public awareness about this critical issue.</p>
<p>   A new poll released last month by Young Voter Strategies  reveals that education and college affordability are the top  issues concerning young voters heading into the November midterm  elections. With fully three-quarters of respondents indicating  that a candidate's position on college affordability is important  in determining their vote, young voters will be holding Congress  accountable at the ballot box this November.</p>
<p>   &quot;As students are heading into midterm exams with record-high  debt burdens, members of Congress are entering their midterms  with a similarly formidable challenge,&quot; said Robert Borosage, co- director of Campaign for America's Future. &quot;How can they defend  their votes for the largest cut ever to college aid programs in  the face of the exploding cost of college? It's going to be a  hard test to pass.&quot;</p>
<p>   Since 2000, the average cost of attending a four-year public  college has increased over 40 percent, causing millions of  students to forgo college, drop out or incur serious debt. Yet  earlier this year, Congress cut $12 billion in student aid,  allowed interest rates on college loans to spike and failed to  raise the maximum Pell grant.</p>
<p>   &quot;Students are suffering the consequences of policies that  place even more barriers between them and the college education  they need to succeed in today's competitive global economy,&quot; said  Jennifer Pae, United States Student Association president. &quot;As  students are forced to spend thousands of more dollars due to  increasing college costs, stagnant financial aid levels and the  largest cuts in the history of the student loan programs,  students across the country are taking education and college  affordability as their issue to mobilize around this election.&quot;</p>
<p>   With four weeks until the elections, groups around the country  are calling attention to the importance of college affordability  and candidates' voting records and positions on the issue.</p>
<p>   USAction affiliates in Colorado, Florida, Illinois, Maryland,  Missouri, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, West Virginia and  Wisconsin are leading a series of public events to demand that  Congress invest in America's future by making critical new  commitments to America's students. USAction is also coordinating  similar activities with partners in Minnesota, Ohio, Pennsylvania  and elsewhere with help from national allies in the Emergency  Campaign for America's Priorities (ECAP).</p>
<p>   The Campaign for America's Future released a report last  month, based on new Census data, finding that the full cost of  college for one year at a public university now consumes 25  percent of the annual median household income in America. The  report also includes a record of key college affordability votes  along with a letter grade for each member of Congress based on  their voting record.</p>
<p>   The United States Student Association (USSA) is running the  Students Vote 2006 Campaign in six key states, California,  Florida, Michigan, Oregon, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, to  register, educate and turn out students on Election Day.</p>
<p>   USSA is also urging the Department of Education to prioritize  the needs of students when making changes to student loan  programs, the SMART/ACG grants and the Higher Education Act. USSA  is holding press conferences and collecting student debt stories  to emphasize the failure of our government's priorities on  education. This student advocacy group will also be providing  testimonials at the Negotiated Rule Making hearings on Nov. 2 at  the Royal Pacific Hotel Conference Center in Orlando, Florida,  and Nov. 8 at the Department of Education office in Washington,  D.C.</p>
<p>   The national USSA Board of Directors will also be heading to  the Hill on Oct. 19 to ensure that Congress will maintain its  promise for a $7 billion increase to the Labor HHS bill to  maintain its current funds for higher education programs and to  suppress the Voter ID bill which disenfranchises student voters.</p>
<p>   Campus Progress, working with its network of students across  the country, has launched a nationwide &quot;Debt Hits Hard&quot; campaign.  They're pressing for three key changes: ending corporate welfare  that wastes billions of taxpayer dollars in subsidies to banks;  easing the debt burden on students and families by cutting  student loan interest rates in half; and making financial aid  more effective and accessible for American families by raising  the maximum Pell Grant to $5,100 and raising awareness of  financial aid resources in low-income communities. Student  campaigns will focus on letter-writing and campus speaking events  and will utilize three hard-hitting videos produced by Campus  Progress.

<p>   The College Democrats of America launched an online resource  guide last month, enabling students to participate in &quot;Reverse  the Raid on Student Aid&quot; programming. The resource guide equips  College Democrats with the tools they need to host events on  their campuses. The goals of these programs are to raise issue  awareness, increase membership and allow students to take an  active role the passage of HR 5150, which would cut interest  rates on college loans in half.</p>
<p>   Young Democrats of America's chapters will host three  Political Action Days, including Election Day Nov. 7, to educate  young people on issues such as college affordability and to get  young people to the polls to vote for change.</p>
<p>   Student groups around the country are inviting members of  Congress to their campuses to discuss college affordability.  Students at Indiana University, Ohio State University, the  University of Connecticut, Georgetown University and the  University of Pennsylvania have already helped to increase  political dialogue in this way.</p>
