<p>WASHINGTON - January 13 - <p>   News Advisory: </p>
<p>   -- Major Address: Monday, Jan. 16 at 12 p.m.</p>
<p>   -- Al Gore to Warn of Threat to Constitution From President's Actions</p>

<p>   -- Wake-Up Call for Legislative, Judicial Branches: Wiretap Policy Only Latest Extension of Unchecked Executive Power</p>
<p>   -- Introduction by Former Rep. Bob Barr highlights breadth of ideological concern over abuse of executive power</p>
<p>   WHAT: Major address by Al Gore</p>
<p>   WHEN: Monday, Jan. 16 at 12 p.m. (doors open at 10:30 a.m.) </p>
<p>   WHERE: DAR Constitution Hall, 1776 D Street, NW, Washington, D.C. </p>
<p>   Former Vice President Al Gore will deliver a major address Monday on the threat posed by policies of the Bush Administration to the Constitution and the checks and balances it created.   The speech will specifically point to domestic wiretapping and torture as examples of the administration's efforts to extend executive power beyond Congressional direction and judicial review.</p>

<p>   The Vice President will make the case that the country -- including the legislative and judicial branches and all Americans -- must act now to defend the systems put into place by the country's founders to curb executive power or risk permanent and irreversible damage to the Constitution.   </p>
<p>   The extent of bipartisan concern over these issues is highlighted by former Republican Rep. Bob Barr's introduction of the Vice President next Wednesday, and by the organizations cosponsoring the speech. </p>
<p>     The Liberty Coalition brings together ideologically diverse organizations across the political spectrum, including liberal and conservative groups, to preserve the Bill of Rights, personal autonomy and individual privacy. </p>
<p>   The American Constitution Society for Law and Policy (ACS) is one of the nation's leading progressive legal organizations. Founded in 2001, ACS works to ensure that the fundamental principles of human dignity, individual rights and liberties, genuine equality, and access to justice are in their rightful, central place in American law. </p>
