<p>WASHINGTON - July 19 - In the aftermath of the 
pledging conference on Darfur, held yesterday in Brussels, Africa Action 
today released the following short statement and an updated version of 
its "Talking Points on How to Stop Genocide in Darfur, Sudan" (below).

<p>"As the situation in Darfur worsens by the day, this week's pledging 
conference in Brussels revealed a broad international consensus on the 
need for a United Nations (UN) peacekeeping force to protect civilians 
and humanitarian operations on the ground. But the international 
community's failure to overcome Khartoum's objections to such a UN 
force, and to take new action to initiate such a force, leaves the 
Sudanese government to dictate the pace and the extent of the response 
to this crisis. The most immediate priority for the people of Darfur is 
protection, and yet world powers are failing to offer this protection or 
to articulate a plan to achieve this on an urgent basis.

<p>"The additional pledges of money in Brussels to support the African 
Union (AU) operation in Darfur amount to only a portion of what the AU 
needs to sustain even its current mission, which is clearly inadequate 
to the protection needs on the ground. A UN peacekeeping force is needed 
to reinforce the AU operation and to stop the violence and protect 
civilians and humanitarian efforts in Darfur.

<p>"Africa Action calls on the U.S. and other powers to move beyond pledges 
and stop-gap measures and to do everything necessary to overcome the 
Sudanese government's objections, and authorize and deploy a UN force 
for Darfur immediately."

<p>The organization's new escalation strategy in its Campaign to Stop 
Genocide in Darfur is available at:

<p><b>Africa Action Talking Points on How to Stop Genocide in Darfur, Sudan </b><br>
Last Updated July 2006

<p>Nothing short of international intervention will stop the genocide in 
Darfur. Africa Action believes that the U.S. must do everything 
necessary to secure a United Nations (UN) Security Council Resolution 
authorizing a multinational intervention force, under Chapter 7 of the 
UN Charter, to stop the genocide and protect civilians and humanitarian 
efforts in Darfur.


<p><b>1. What is Genocide?</b>

<p>The international legal definition of the crime of genocide is found in 
Articles II and III of the 1948 Convention on the Prevention and 
Punishment of Genocide. Article II describes the two elements that 
constitute the crime of genocide:
<blockquote>
(i) The mental element, meaning the "intent to destroy, in whole or in 
part, a national, ethnic, racial or religious group, as such", and
<p>(ii) The physical element, which includes five types of violence 
described in sections [a] though [e] as follows: [a] Killing members of 
the group; [b] Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the 
group; [c] Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life 
calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part; 
[d] Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group; [e] 
Forcibly transferring children of the group to another group.
</blockquote>

<p><b>2. What is happening in Darfur is Genocide</b>

<p>(i) Genocidal Intent: The intent of the Sudanese government to destroy, 
in whole or in part, three African ethnic communities (the Fur, Zaghawa 
and Massaleit), is clear from at least four categories of evidence: [a] 
Documentary evidence; [b] Legal inference based upon the systematic 
perpetration of culpable acts directed against specific targeted groups; 
[c] Testimony of witnesses who are survivors of the genocide; and [d] 
Government efforts to eliminate all traces of mass graves.

<p>[a] Documentary evidence: Sudanese Government documents obtained and 
released by Human Rights Watch make clear government intent through its 
actions of arming, equipping and transporting Arab militias to destroy, 
in part, targeted groups. In violation of UN Security Council 
Resolutions, the government has withheld other documents requested by 
the UN, such as flight logs for aircraft (planes and helicopter 
gunships) used by the government in Darfur, as well as the minutes of 
meetings of government security officials on Darfur. Such documents 
would likely provide further documentary evidence of genocidal intent. 
According to The New York Times on February 23, 2005, African Union 
observers have also uncovered a document that indicates a policy of 
genocide on the part of the government.

<p>[b] International legal precedent (from the International Criminal 
Tribunals for Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia) holds that genocidal 
intent can be inferred from the context of the perpetration of culpable 
acts when they are systematically directed against a group. For more 
than three years, the government of Sudan has established a pattern of 
atrocities including mass killings, mass rapes, bombings, burning and 
pillaging villages, and destruction of water wells and crops, 
systematically directed against the targeted groups.

<p>[c] The testimony of survivors of genocide in Darfur consistently 
reports that the perpetrators of the atrocities frequently and clearly 
stated their intent to destroy these groups as part of a broader 
government-inspired effort. Attackers' statements, such as "we will kill 
all the black," are documented in an International Criminal Court report 
from June 2006.

<p>[d] According to witnesses and documentary evidence, the government of 
Sudan has sought to erase all trace of large mass graves of executed 
civilians in Darfur. It has prevented researchers from obtaining 
forensic evidence from such sites.

<p>(ii) Genocidal Actions: In Darfur during the past three years, the 
physical acts of violence that have been systematically directed against 
the targeted groups have included all five categories of violence listed 
in the Genocide Convention. These acts have resulted in the deaths of 
more than 450,000 people*:

<p>The following letters correspond to the five categories of genocidal 
violence listed under the legal definition of genocide at the beginning 
of this document:

<p>[a] more than 200,000 people have been killed by government forces and 
militias from 2003 to the present time, and the killing continues;

<p>[b] bodily and mental harm has been inflicted upon thousands of women 
and young girls raped by soldiers and militias.

<p>[c] at least an additional 200,000 lives have been lost through the 
deliberate destruction of homes, crops and water resources and the 
physical displacement of more than two million people which have 
resulted in conditions of famine and disease epidemics;

<p>[d] the killing of pregnant women; and

<p>[e] the use of rape as a weapon of genocide as many perpetrators have 
stated that their intent is to change the ethnic identity of the child 
conceived by rape.


<p><b>3. The Humanitarian Crisis</b>

<p><li>Genocide in Darfur has created the worst humanitarian crisis in the 
world: There are more than 2.5 million people in camps for Internally 
Displaced People (IDPs) in Darfur and roughly 250,000 people have been 
displaced or re-displaced since the beginning of 2006. The UN estimates 
that up to 4 million people in Darfur are reliant on humanitarian aid 
for survival. A lack of funding compelled the World Food Program to 
reduce food rations beginning in May. Only 50% of the $648 million 
needed for humanitarian operations in 2006 has been either pledged or 
received.

<p><li>It is estimated that almost 7,000 people are dying each month in 
Darfur and that this figure could rise significantly if humanitarian 
operations continue to be obstructed by violence. In July 2006, UN 
Under-Secretary for Humanitarian Affairs Jan Egeland warned of growing 
insecurity and a lack of funding, indicating that humanitarian 
operations were on the brink of collapse. Such a collapse would 
jeopardize hundreds of thousands of lives in Darfur.

<p><li>The Khartoum government cannot be trusted to address the humanitarian 
crisis: Across the region, government tactics such as import 
restrictions on fuel and routine harassment of aid workers, stand in the 
way of effective relief efforts. In a May 2006 report, UN 
Secretary-General Kofi Annan characterized the government's obstruction 
of food aid as a "violation of international humanitarian law." The 
government of Sudan is the author of the ongoing genocide in Darfur, and 
Khartoum cannot be trusted to provide security to humanitarian 
operations there.

<p><li>Security is Essential for Humanitarian Efforts: Adequate humanitarian 
assistance cannot be provided to vulnerable and displaced groups in 
Darfur without military protection. This reality is particularly evident 
as relief workers are increasingly targeted, forcing restrictions in aid 
operations. A multinational intervention is necessary to provide 
security and logistical support to urgent humanitarian efforts.


<p><b>4. The African Union Cannot Respond Alone</b>

<p><li>The African Union (AU)-sponsored peace talks between the Sudanese 
government and the rebel groups in Abuja, Nigeria, under intense 
international pressure, culminated in the signing of a Darfur Peace 
Agreement (DPA) on May 5, 2006. However, only one faction of the main 
rebel groups, and the Sudanese government, signed this deal. The 
cease-fire has had no effect in deterring violence on the ground on all 
sides, and attacks against civilians have increased. Violence is also 
increasingly spilling across the border into neighboring Chad.

<p><li>The AU has some 7,000 troops on the ground in Darfur - still short of 
the 7,700 that the AU agreed in March 2005. Jan Egeland at the UN has 
stressed that the force in Darfur "needs to be boosted to three times 
the strength of the current" force. Moreover, the AU has no mandate to 
protect civilians, and its mission's credibility among the Darfuri 
population has plummeted.

<p><li>The AU mission in Darfur clearly lacks the troop strength, and the 
financial and logistical support necessary, to stop the ongoing 
genocide. As the mission has struggled to perform with few resources, it 
has been blamed both internationally and locally for its weaknesses. The 
AU force has increasingly come under fire in Darfur.

<p><li>The AU has agreed on the need for a transition from its current 
operation to a larger UN peacekeeping force, but the Sudanese government 
continues to oppose such a transition. The AU has recently pushed the 
proposed transfer date to the end of this year, but a UN mission has yet 
to be authorized, and this AU decision therefore creates no immediate 
improvements in the situation on the ground.

<p><li>Genocide is not an African problem, it is an international problem 
and, as such, it requires an international response. The African Union 
is a young organization (established in 2002) and it is not equipped to 
respond to a crisis of this magnitude. Faced with such a grave 
challenge, the international community cannot allow the AU to fail, but 
rather must support, reinforce and expand upon its efforts in Darfur.


<p><b>5. The U.S. Government Acknowledges Genocide, But Fails to Act</b>

<p><li>The U.S. is the only government to have publicly acknowledged that 
what is happening in Darfur constitutes genocide. On September 9, 2004, 
then-Secretary of State Colin Powell declared on behalf of the Bush 
Administration that, "genocide has been committed in Darfur, and that 
the government of Sudan and the Janjawid bear responsibility." The White 
House issued a statement the same day confirming this determination.

<p><li>At the same time as he acknowledged that genocide was being carried 
out in Darfur, Powell also defied logic, stating, "no new action is 
dictated by this determination."

<p><li>President Bush has failed to prioritize the genocide in Darfur. His 
stated concern and promises of limited logistical support for the AU 
mission have not been matched by concrete actions to stop the genocide 
and protect the people of Darfur. The Administration has declared 
support for a UN mission in Darfur, but it has failed to use its 
leverage with the Sudanese government to overcome its objections to such 
a force.

<p><li>U.S. policy towards Sudan is marked by three competing policy 
priorities: (1) support for the newly formed government of national 
unity as part of the North-South peace process, (2) intelligence-sharing 
with the Sudanese government as part of the so-called 'war on terror', 
and (3) ending the genocide in Darfur. The inability of the U.S. to 
stand firm on a clear message of action against genocide has undermined 
the international response on Darfur.

<p><li>The U.S. has a clear moral and legal obligation to prevent and punish 
genocide as a signatory to the Convention on the Prevention & Punishment 
of the Crime of Genocide.

<p><li>The U.S. has provided some transportation and logistical support to 
the African Union troops on the ground in Darfur, and engaged in efforts 
to support the peace process. But its actions still remain wholly 
inadequate in response to an ongoing genocide.


<p><b>6. The UN Acknowledges Crimes Against Humanity, But Fails to Act</b>

<p><li>The United Nations' International Commission of Inquiry on Darfur 
delivered its report to UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan in January 2005. 
The report found that the Sudanese government has committed major crimes 
under international law, including a pattern of mass killings, rape, 
pillage and forced displacement and that these constitute war crimes and 
crimes against humanity.

<p><li>Although the report provided ample evidence of genocidal intent and 
actions on the part of the Sudanese government, the commission concluded 
that it did not find a government policy of genocide in Darfur. This 
hearkens back to the time of the genocide in Rwanda in 1994, when the 
international community dodged the term "genocide" to avoid the 
obligations that such a serious charge would invoke.

<p><li>The first conclusion of the report states that the people of Darfur 
"have been living a nightmare of violence and abuse" and that "they need 
protection," but the report fails to recommend any measures to provide 
such protection. Subsequent monthly reports by the Secretary-General on 
the crisis in Darfur emphasize the protection needs of the people of 
Darfur and the growing violence they face.

<p><li>The UN Security Council has hesitated on Darfur, largely because of 
the economic and diplomatic interests of its permanent members 
especially China and Russia, who don't wish to antagonize Khartoum. 
China is the single largest investor in Sudan's oil sector, while Russia 
is Khartoum's major arms supplier.

<p><li>The UN has recently begun to take initial steps toward planning a 
peacekeeping force for Darfur, building upon the realization of the DPA, 
but these steps have yet to make a difference on the ground. A joint 
AU-UN technical assessment mission to Darfur in June investigated the 
necessary mandate, force size and cost of a future UN mission.

<p><li>Without a strong international commitment to expedite the realization 
of a UN peacekeeping mission in Darfur, the deployment of such a force 
could still be months away. The UN Under-Secretary General for 
Peacekeeping suggested in June 2006 that a UN deployment might not be 
feasible before January 2007. Meanwhile, insecurity and humanitarian 
decline continue to claim lives in Darfur.


<p><b>7. What is needed is an Urgent International Intervention</b>

<p><li>As the genocide continues in Darfur and across the border in 
neighboring Chad, stopping the genocide & protecting the people of 
Darfur must be the first priority of the international community. There 
is now an international consensus that a robust UN peacekeeping force is 
needed in Darfur on an urgent basis.

<p><li>An international intervention would serve four critical purposes: (1) 
Stop the killings, rapes and pillaging in Darfur; (2) Provide security 
to facilitate urgent humanitarian assistance programs; (3) Enforce the 
African Union cease-fire established by the Darfur Peace Agreement 
between the Khartoum government and one of the rebel groups, and (4) 
facilitate the voluntary return of IDPs to their land and the 
reconstruction of their homes by providing a secure environment.

<p><li>In September 2005, member states of the UN recognized the fact that 
there is an international "responsibility to protect" civilians from 
genocide and crimes against humanity. The response to Darfur now tests 
this principle. Unless the UN acts to protect the people of Darfur, the 
African Union will continue to be left to bear the brunt of this growing 
catastrophe, and it will likely be blamed for failing to act 
sufficiently & in time to save hundreds of thousands of lives.

<p><li>The most efficient way to realize a multinational force in Darfur 
would be to immediately provide the African Union troops already on the 
ground with a Chapter 7 mandate to protect civilians, turning them into 
a "blue-helmeted" UN force. This would save time on deployment, since 
these troops are already in Darfur, and would provide them with 
international authority and backing. It would also furnish them with a 
mandate to protect civilians and to enforce (not just observe) the 
cease-fire.

<p><li>Once the AU operation has been "re-hatted" as a UN mission with a 
mandate to protect civilians, the UN should immediately begin 
reinforcing and expanding that mission with a UN peacekeeping force. 
This multinational force should comprise at least 20,000 troops.


<p><b>8. What the U.S. should do:</b>

<p><li>As the genocide continues in Darfur, the U.S. must use its leverage 
and take every step necessary to overcome Khartoum's objections to a UN 
force.

<p><li>At the UN Security Council, the U.S. must take immediate steps to 
ensure the rapid authorization and deployment of a UN peacekeeping 
mission to Darfur, under Chapter 7 of the UN Charter. The U.S. must 
expend the necessary diplomatic capital to overcome any Chinese and 
Russian objections to such a UN mission.

<p><li>Just over a decade ago, the U.S. blocked UN action as genocide 
unfolded in Rwanda. Many UN member states are also skeptical about U.S. 
intentions given its un-sanctioned intervention in Iraq. But the U.S. 
must convince the members of the UN Security Council that the genocide 
in Darfur requires urgent international action.

<p><li>The Bush Administration faces growing public pressure for action to 
stop the genocide in Darfur. By taking all necessary steps to achieve a 
UN peacekeeping mission in Darfur, the U.S. government would demonstrate 
its commitment to protecting the people of Darfur and fulfill those 
calls for leadership in the face of the first genocide of the 21st century.


<p>* Accurate estimates of the death toll in Darfur have been difficult to 
ascertain because of obstruction on the part of the Sudanese government 
and because of UN unwillingness to offer an official estimate. The best 
regular estimates of mortality rates in Darfur have been provided by 
Prof. Eric Reeves of Smith College (among others), who makes use of 
extensive data and scientific formulae for projecting death rates in 
comparable conditions. (<a href="http://www.sudanreeves.org/" target="_new">http://www.sudanreeves.org/</a>). The Coalition for 
International Justice also released a report in April 2005, confirming 
that the death toll in Darfur was then close to 400,000.
