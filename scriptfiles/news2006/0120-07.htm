<p>WASHINGTON - January 20 - A federal 
                  district judge's <a href="http://www.gwu.edu/%7Ensarchiv/pdbnews/PDB_Judge_Levi_vs_Berman.pdf" target="_blank">opinion</a> last year ordering more secrecy for two almost 40-year-old 
                  CIA memos to President Johnson contradicted Supreme Court precedent 
                  and the plain language of the Freedom of Information Act, as 
                  well as time limits on presidential privilege set in the Presidential 
                  Records Act, according to <a href="http://www.gwu.edu/%7Ensarchiv/pdbnews/BRMN_APP_BRF.pdf" target="_blank">the 
                  appeal</a> filed yesterday with the U.S. Court of Appeals for 
                  the Ninth Circuit by University of California, Davis professor 
                  Larry Berman.</p>
                <p>Represented by Thomas Burke and Duffy Carolan of Davis Wright 
                  Tremaine LLP, and by Meredith Fuchs of the National Security 
                  Archive at George Washington University, Professor Berman sought 
                  declassification review and release of two President's Daily 
                  Briefs prepared by the CIA for President Johnson during the 
                  Vietnam War, one from the day before and one from the day after 
                  two <a href="http://www.gwu.edu/%7Ensarchiv/pdbnews/index.htm#pdbs">other Briefs</a> that had previously been 
                  declassified by the CIA.</p>
              <div align="left"> 
                <p>In response, <a href="http://www.gwu.edu/%7Ensarchiv/pdbnews/BRMN_APP_BRF.pdf" target="_blank">the 
                  CIA argued</a> - and U.S. district judge David Levi upheld CIA's 
                  claims - that, regardless of their age and content, no Briefs 
                  could be released even in part without damage to U.S. national 
                  security and to the presidential privilege of confidential communications 
                  with advisers. During the same month in which Professor Berman 
                  filed his legal complaint, however, the CIA actually <a href="http://www.gwu.edu/%7Ensarchiv/pdbnews/PDB-1967-LBJL.pdf" target="_blank">declassified 
                  two other LBJ-era Briefs</a> when they appeared in cable format 
                  rather than on President's Daily Brief letterhead.</p>
                <p>Judge Levi declined to review the two Briefs at issue in the 
                  case, ignored the millions of pages of declassified and published 
                  CIA intelligence products already available (including <a href="http://www.gwu.edu/%7Ensarchiv/pdbnews/index.htm#pdbs">35 
                  other declassified Briefs</a> introduced into the record by 
                  Professor Berman), and ruled that the Briefs are themselves 
                  an &quot;intelligence method&quot; that must be protected. Attorney 
                  Duffy Carolan commented, &quot;Judge Levi's decision offers 
                  no logical distinction between the CIA's secret methods of gathering 
                  intelligence and the intelligence product it prepares for its 
                  customers. It essentially ignores 40 years of FOIA history and 
                  practice.&quot; </p>
              </div>
              <div align="left"> 
                <p>Judge Levi also ruled that presidential privilege still applies 
                  to the LBJ-era briefs, despite the Supreme Court's finding in 
                  the Nixon tapes cases that privilege erodes over time, and Congress's 
                  clear finding in the 1978 Presidential Records Act that the 
                  privilege no longer applies 12 years after the president leaves 
                  office.</p>
                <p>&quot;This case is not about revealing intelligence sources 
                  and methods,&quot; remarked Professor Berman, a noted Vietnam 
                  War scholar. &quot;This case is about whether the CIA can declare 
                  its factual briefings to the president, no matter how old and 
                  no matter what they say, off limits to history and to the American 
                  public, forever and without review.&quot; </p>
              </div>
              <div align="left">A number of noted scholars of the American Presidency 
                and the Vietnam War, as well as the nation's leading history and 
                political science associations, are planning to file an amicus 
                curiae brief on January 25 in support of Professor Berman's appeal.<!-- #EndEditable -->
