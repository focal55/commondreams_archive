<p>WASHINGTON - May 15 - People around the country are celebrating Mother's Day not only with the traditional gifts of cards and flowers, but with a request to their lawmakers to enact legislation (HR 3760 and S. 1756) currently in the U.S. House and Senate to create a U.S. Department of Peace (DOP).

<p>Supporters in Florida called on 23 congressional offices, pies in hand, urging their representatives and senators to get the DOP bills out of committee and onto the House and Senate floors for a vote.  According to Cynthia Seymour, State Coordinator for the Florida Department of Peace Campaign, their message was well-received.

<p>"We were welcomed in each of these offices, and they in turn were impacted in a most wonderful way."  Seymour continued, "There is so much grace in this work."

<p>From coast to coast, supporters of the Department of Peace legislation visited their U.S. Representatives and Senators bearing 'peace pies,' representing the federal budget, with a tiny slice cut to demonstrate the amount needed to fund the Department ($8 billion).  This amount is less than 2% of the $400 billion the United States currently allocates to the defense department. Around the country, these emissaries of peace engaged in lively dialogue with Congressional staff members about the role this Department would play in strengthening national security and reducing domestic violence.

<p>"Currently the U.S. government does not have an organized approach to create nonviolent solutions to domestic and international conflict," said Dot Maver, Executive Director of the Peace Alliance, the organization coordinating the national event.  "Creating a U.S. Department of Peace would give us much-needed tools to help in the war on terror, as well as reducing violence in all its ugly forms here at home."

<p>Today in Houston, Texas, supporters rallied at the Mickey Leland Federal Building after visiting eight congressional offices to show their support for a U.S. Department of Peace.  "Mother's Day was originally a day of peace activism," said Kathy Kidd, State Coordinator for the Texas Department of Peace Campaign.  Kidd noted further that Mother's Day gained official prominence in 1870, when Julia Ward Howe, poet and author of The Battle Hymn of the Republic, protested the carnage of the Civil War by organizing the mothers of dead soldiers - from both sides - to work for peace.  "We want our legislators to honor this Mother's Day by supporting legislation to create a US Department of Peace," Kidd said.

<p>A DOP would research and analyze foreign policy and recommend to the
President ways to address the root causes of war.   A Peace Academy, on
par with the Military Service Academies, would train civilian peacekeepers and the military in the latest nonviolent conflict resolution techniques and approaches. The Department would also provide expert advice to the President when diffusing or dealing with international crises.

<p>Domestically, the Department would be responsible for developing new policies that address issues such as child abuse, domestic violence, gang violence, and cultural and racial violence.  Statistics reveal that each year, medical expenses from domestic violence alone total at least $3 to $5 billion. Businesses forfeit another $100 million in lost wages, sick leave, absenteeism and non-productivity due to domestic violence. 
Providing the tools necessary to teach violence prevention to America's school children is just one of the many ways a DOP would reduce violence in our homes and schools.

<p>"A Department of Peace would send a powerful proclamation to Americans and the world that the United States intends to use its great strength to participate in peace," Maver said.
