<p>WASHINGTON - July 14 - <br>
<B><A href="mailto:jdajani@linktv.org">JAMAL DAJANI</A></B><br>
Dajani is producer of the TV program "MOSAIC: World News from the Middle East," which features dramatic recent footage of the conflict. He said today: "We try to provide in a half-hour program a comprehensive look at both the narrative and pictures from the TV networks in the Mideast. From the footage that we're seeing, Israel isn't doing much of anything to Hezbollah -- they're bombing civilians and the infrastructure in Lebanon."<BR>

A British journalist based in Nazareth, Israel, Cook is writing regularly on events from there. A recent piece of his noted that just before the Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit was abducted on June 25, Israel had abducted two Palestinians. Cook wrote: "Few readers of a British newspaper would have noticed the story. In the <I>Observer</I> of 25 June, it merited a mere paragraph hidden in the 'World in brief' section, revealing that the previous day a team of Israeli commandos had entered the Gaza Strip to 'detain' two Palestinians Israel claims are members of Hamas. The significance of the mission was alluded to in a final phrase describing this as 'the first arrest raid in the territory since Israel pulled out of the area a year ago.'" The original piece in the Observer is at <A

<p>Cook is author of the just-released book <I>Blood and Religion: The Unmasking of the Jewish and Democratic State</I>.<BR>
