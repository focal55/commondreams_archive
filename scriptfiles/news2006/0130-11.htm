<p>NEW YORK  - January 30 - 
On Tuesday, Jan. 31, at 8 p.m., thousands of demonstrators will gather at the Capitol Reflecting Pool, close to the Capitol, during Bush's State of the Union Address, to demand an end to the Bush regime, saying that after years of an unjust war raging in Iraq, widespread use of torture, massive spying and total neglect of the people of New Orleans, it is time to force President Bush to step down.
<p>   This demonstration is organized by The World Can't Wait-Drive Out the Bush Regime, a national organization launched Nov. 2, 2005, with actions in nearly 70 cities, including the biggest national high school walk-out in decades.  &quot;This Tuesday in Washington, D.C. and throughout the country the people are speaking: Bush lied, Bush spied, Bush must step down,&quot; a spokesperson said.</p>
<p>   WHO: </p>
<p>   -- Cindy Sheehan, Gold Star Families for Peace, lost her son in Iraq;</p>
<p>   -- Ann Wright, former US diplomat and military officer quit in protest of war;</p>
<p>   -- Debra Sweet, National Coordinator, World Can't Wait</p>
<p>   -- Doug Nelson, Veterans for Peace</p>
<p>   -- Rev. Lennox Yearwood, The Hip-Hop Caucus</p>
<p>   -- Rev. Deborah Lake, Interfaith Alliance</p>
<p>   -- Jim Klimaski, attorney for World Can't Wait</p>
<p>   -- Tim Carpenter, Progressive Democrats of America</p>
<p>   -- Performance Artists: Guerilla Poets, Rhythm Workers Union, Chris Chandler/David Roe, Rabbi David Schneyer, Herb Smith        </p>
<p>   -- Thousands of People: Bringing pots, pans, and voices to drown out Bush </p>
<p>   -- Travis Morales, World Can't Wait, will MC</p>
<p>   WHAT: Protest to Demand Bush Step Down: During the State of the Union people will drown out Bush's address with drums and violins, banging pots, sounding car horns lifting voices, and churches will ring their bells. People will use flashlights to shine the light on Bush's lies.</p>
<p>   WHEN: Tuesday, Jan. 31, 2006:</p>
<p>   -- 8 to 9 p.m. Speakers</p>
<p>   -- 9 p.m. &quot;Drown-Out&quot; </p>
<p>   WHERE: West Side of the Capitol at the Capitol Reflecting Pool</p>
<p>   As Bush's approval ratings drops, people will be in the streets demanding Bush step down. According to the group, the people in America now know that we were falsely led into war, the devastation in New Orleans has more to do with government failure then nature, unemployment has risen to its highest rate in over a decade, and the people are no longer willing to accept Bush as president. Debra Sweet, national coordinator of World Can't Wait said, &quot;Bush lies, spies, breaks the law, lets thousands die, receives huge disapproval ratings and just keeps going. The only way this regime will be stopped is if we, the people, urgently mobilize in truly massive, determined, unrelenting protest with the concrete demand that Bush step down and take his program with him.&quot;</p>
