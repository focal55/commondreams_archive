<p>WASHINGTON - June 9 - ACORN has been waging a national campaign for more than three years against Wells Fargo's predatory mortgage lending. As a result, the company has changed certain lending policies, such as reducing prepayment penalties and eliminating mandatory arbitration.
</p>
<p>But Wells has yet to compensate customers who suffered from previous abuses, as other leading lenders have done. On June 8 in Washington, DC, Wells Fargo hosted a symposium on homeownership and presented a new program aimed at helping its subprime customers "reach financial security."
</p>
<p>A press release for the event featured a statement from a Wells Fargo executive that "helping borrowers get on a path to financial success is the heart of responsible lending." 
</p>
<p>However, according to ACORN, Wells Fargo should show its concern for its customers' financial success and stability by making amends to them for Wells Fargo's past abusive lending practices.
</p>
<p>"Wells still needs to compensate the families and communities its predatory lending has hurt," said Maude Hurd, ACORN's National President. "Also Wells Fargo's business practice changes must be made permanent and enforceable by Court order. Otherwise, Wells could revert to its old ways of doing business." 
</p>
<p>In 2003, ACORN launched a national campaign to shed light on Wells Fargo's abusive lending, to force them to change their predatory practices, and to win some compensation for the borrowers they had harmed. The campaign has included a steady and escalating series of actions, from demonstrations at local Wells Fargo offices throughout the country to a 2,000 person march to Wells Fargo's downtown Los Angeles office last summer.
</p>
<p>At Wells Fargo's shareholder meeting in April 2006, 20 members were able to go inside the meeting and directly confront CEO Richard Kovacevich about Wells Fargo's lending. As part of the campaign ACORN is actively pursuing civil litigation against Wells Fargo in California to benefits Wells Fargo borrowers.
</p>
<p>In addition, ACORN has submitted complaints to several state and regulatory agencies asking them to investigate Wells Fargo.</p>
