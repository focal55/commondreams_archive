<p>WASHINGTON - June 7 - As the 
Senate failed to limit debate on the Federal Marriage Amendment today, the 
American Civil Liberties Union applauded the legislators for effectively 
rejecting the discriminatory proposal, and called on the House of Representative 
to do the same.&nbsp; By a vote 49 to 48, 
the Senate failed, once again, to garner the 60 votes necessary to invoke 
cloture, a procedural move that would limit floor discussion and bring the 
measure to a vote.&nbsp;
<P>&#8220;The failure to close 
debate on the Federal Marriage Amendment is a clear sign that Congress is not 
bending to the will of the president,&#8221; said Caroline Fredrickson, the Director 
of the ACLU Washington Legislative Office.&nbsp; 
&#8220;The Bush administration&#8217;s transparent and desperate appeal to its 
conservative base is both shameless and shameful.&nbsp; Though President Bush seems intolerant 
of gay and lesbian Americans and their families, we must be vigorous and 
generous in countering his message with one of tolerance and equality. Using one 
group of Americans as a divisive 
political ploy is disgraceful.&#8221;</P>
<P>The last time the 
Senate voted on the amendment was in 2004, when it failed to cut off debate by a 
vote of 48-50.&nbsp; This year, as in the 
past, the amendment not only failed to pick up enough votes to cut off debate &#8211; 
it failed even to pick up the votes of a majority of the Senate and it fell far 
short of the two-thirds vote necessary to approve a constitutional 
amendment.&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>&#8220;The fact that 
proponents of the amendment could not even rouse a simple majority on a 
procedural vote is good news,&#8221; said Legislative Counsel Christopher Anders.&nbsp; &#8220;In a Senate with four more Republicans 
than during the last vote in 2004, supporters of the Federal Marriage Amendment 
&nbsp;picked up only one 
vote.&nbsp; At this pace, advocates of 
the amendment will not be able to reach a two-thirds majority until at least 
2042.&nbsp; It&#8217;s time for President Bush 
to pull the plug on this discriminatory amendment.&#8221;&nbsp; </P>
