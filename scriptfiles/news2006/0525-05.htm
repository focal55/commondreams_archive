<p>WASHINGTON - May 25 - <p align="center">&#8216;Senator Frist and his right-wing allies can&#8217;t credibly campaign for re-election on real solutions to America&#8217;s real problems, because they have no solutions and they created the problems. Instead, Frist and his right-wing friends are playing politics with the Constitution and bashing a single group of Americans. That&#8217;s not an agenda any American is talking about at the gas pump, the emergency room or veterans&#8217; hospital. It&#8217;s time for Senator Frist to listen to Laura Bush, Dick Cheney, John Danforth and other Republican leaders and put the American people ahead of his discriminatory politics,&#8217; said Human Rights Campaign President Joe Solmonese.&#160; </p>

<p>Human Rights Campaign President Joe 
Solmonese called out Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist&#8217;s 
politically motivated attack on gay Americans today as the senator 
pushed a discriminatory amendment to the U.S. Constitution.</p>

<p>&#8220;Senator Frist and his right-wing allies can&#8217;t credibly 
campaign for re-election on real solutions to America&#8217;s real 
problems, because they have no solutions and they created the problems. 
Instead, Frist and his right-wing friends are playing politics with the 
Constitution and bashing a single group of Americans. That&#8217;s not 
an agenda any American is talking about at the gas pump, the emergency 
room or veterans&#8217; hospital. It&#8217;s time for Senator Frist to 
listen to Laura Bush, Dick Cheney, John Danforth and other Republican 
leaders and put the American people ahead of his discriminatory 
politics,&#8221; said Solmonese.</p>

<p>Solmonese continued, &#8220;The American people know that marriage 
has absolutely nothing to do with the high cost of gas, the war in Iraq 
or the prohibitive price tag on health care. The consequences of immoral 
leadership are a one-two punch: as they scapegoat hardworking Americans 
and try to put discrimination in the Constitution, the challenges facing 
our nation go unanswered &#8212; it&#8217;s shameful.&#8221;</p>

<p><i>The Human Rights Campaign is the largest national gay, lesbian, 
bisexual and transgender political organization with members throughout 
the country. It effectively lobbies Congress, provides campaign support 
and educates the public to ensure that GLBT Americans can be open, 
honest and safe at home, at work and in the community.</i></p>
