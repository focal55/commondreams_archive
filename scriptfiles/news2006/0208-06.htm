<p>PHILADELPHIA - February 8 - GRAMMY-nominated blues  musician Robert Cray's newest music video &quot;Twenty&quot; made its world  premiere on the American Friends Service Committee (AFSC) Web  site ( <a href="http://releases.usnewswire.com/redir.asp?ReleaseID=60685&Link=http://www.afsc.org">http://www.afsc.org</a> ) Jan. 26. This video, which features  the AFSC's renowned exhibit Eyes Wide Open: The Human Cost of  War, stands as a poignant call for an end to the ongoing war in  Iraq. In the video's first ten days online, nearly 30,000 people  watched &quot;Twenty&quot; and passed it on to their friends. </p>

<p>   Five-time GRAMMY winner, Cray recently received his twelfth  GRAMMY nomination for his album &quot;Twenty.&quot; Nominated for Best  Contemporary Blues Album, the album's thought-provoking title  track &quot;Twenty&quot; stands as a testimony to Cray's opposition to the  ongoing war in Iraq.  In this song, Cray laments the lives lost  in Iraq with the refrain &quot;When you're used up, where do you go,  soldier?&quot; </p>
<p>   The &quot;Twenty&quot; music video -- funded and produced by Cray and  his wife, Sue Turner-Cray -- features 23-year-old Iraq War  veteran Aidan Delgado as an unnamed American soldier. Delgado  returns to his hometown in search of a resting place. He  eventually finds a field filled with over 2000 pairs of combat  boots and looks for the pair that belongs to him.  In the exhibit  as in the video, each pair of boots represents an American  soldier killed in the war in Iraq.</p>

<p>   &quot;It's one thing to follow what's happening in Iraq on the  evening news; it's another to actually see the empty boots of  each and every soldier we've lost there,&quot; reflected Robert Cray.  &quot;It makes us think about the significance of going to war, what  we lose, and whether it's worth it to us.&quot;</p>
<p>   The video itself is a product of coincidence and  collaboration. Though &quot;Twenty&quot; music video Director/Producer, Sue  Turner-Cray had not visited Eyes Wide Open, she had heard of the  boots and thought that the memorial would be an ideal backdrop  for the video. Turner-Cray mentioned this idea to co-producer  Renee Ridgeley, only to learn that Ridgeley's good friend had  been an AFSC intern and had helped coordinate the original Eyes  Wide Open exhibit.  Through this connection, Turner-Cray got in  touch with the AFSC Chicago office and the collaboration began.    </p>
<p>   Since January 2004, the Eyes Wide Open exhibit has toured  throughout the United States as a living memorial to the human  cost of war. This multimedia exhibition of images, words, and  sounds from the Iraq war has visited 75 communities in the past  two years and continues to garner a tremendous reception from the  media and the general public. In an effort to bring this powerful  exhibit to a wider audience, AFSC has also created smaller  versions of Eyes Wide Open featuring boots representing fallen  soldiers from specific states, regions and armed forces such as  the National Guard.  To date, AFSC has received hundreds of  requests to host smaller Eyes Wide Open exhibits in communities  across the country.  Sadly, the smaller exhibits often prove more  feasible as the total number of American soldiers killed grows  each day. </p>
<p>   Founded by Quakers in 1917 as a response to WWI, AFSC strives  to foster peace, justice, and respect for human dignity. AFSC has  worked tirelessly to bring an end to military aggression in all  parts of the world, with recent focus on the US military  involvement in Iraq.  AFSC's activism on this issue brings  together military families, soldiers, religious organizations,  peace groups, and like-minded individuals under one common cause:  ending the US military presence in Iraq.  In addition to its  grassroots efforts, AFSC also fosters peace through available  political channels, working with legislators to craft a feasible  exit plan for troops now stationed in Iraq. By highlighting the  human cost of the Iraq war and building alliances with religious  and legislative partners, AFSC ensures that the peace movement  will play a crucial role in bringing an end to the military  occupation of Iraq. </p>
