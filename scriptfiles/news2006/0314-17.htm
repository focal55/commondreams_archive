<p>NEW YORK - March 14 - To kick off a week of activities and protests marking the third anniversary of the US invasion of Iraq, the anti-war coalition United For Peace and Justice, joined by top media reform organizations, are protesting at media outlets throughout the county including the headquarters of TV networks and outlets in New York, Chicago and Los Angeles. 
 
<p>“Many media outlets aided and abetted the war, not only in its run-up but for the past three years, by selective coverage and un-critical reporting,” says former network producer (ABC, CNN) and MediaChannel.org Editor Danny Schechter, author of two books and an independent film (WMD) on the subject. “Just as media companies aspire to hold the government accountable, the media itself has to be held account for jingoism posing as journalism.” 
 
<p><b>Here are the plans:
</b>
<p><b>NYC Media March planned for March 15th - Noon - 2pm <br>
</b>
We will take a tour to the headquarters of major media outlets with signs calling upon them to "Tell the Truth About the War!" There will be a silent vigil later that evening during the evening newscasts. 
 
<p><b>The March:</b> At noon we will assemble at CBS (51 West 52nd) and then walk down 6th Avenue to NBC HQ (1230 Rock plaza), cross the street in front of CNN and TIME, walk downtown to Fox (48th and 6th), make a right on West 45th with a quick stop at Bertelsmann Headquarters, make a left down Broadway in front of ABC News, cross over to the Military Recruiters in the center of Times Square and then across 7th Avenue to Reuters (43 and 7th), make a left down 43rd Street to the NY Times, and then, return to Broadway and end at MTV/Viacom Headquarters (1515 Broadway). 

<p>At each stop, speakers will appeal to the public and the media executives inside. 
 
<p><b>At 6pm we will have groups hold silent vigils</b> during evening newscasts at CNN (West 58th St), CBS Broadcast Center (West 57th and l0th), NBC (outside where the Today Show broadcasts) and Fox (48th and 6th). 
 
<p>* Planned meetings with media executives were cancelled when no network agreed to hear from delegations of anti-war activists.
