<p>NEW YORK - April 20 - Today the Center for Constitutional Rights (CCR) welcomed support from theNational Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), the League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC), the Japanese American Citizens League (JACL), the Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund (AALDEF), the Arab-American Anti-Discrimination Committee (ADC) and United for Peace and Justice (UFPJ) and a coalition of business leaders in its challenge to the NSA domestic spying program (CCR v. Bush).  Both coalitions filed amicus briefs in support of CCR’s motion for summary judgment, which asserts that the Bush Administration has admitted enough incriminating facts to prove the NSA Program is illegal and requests an injunction to bar further spying on Americans.

<p>CCR Legal Director Bill Goodman noted the support from major organizations is coming at an early stage in the proceedings: “It is unusual to have amicus briefs this early in a case, and I think this support reflects the widespread concern about the dangers of domestic spying.  These CEOs and civil rights leaders know the danger of government abuse firsthand, and we welcome their support.”

 

<p>The civil rights leaders brief, filed by the Brennan Center for Justice at NYU School of Law, details how previous administrations abused domestic spying in deliberate attempts to monitor, intimidate, discredit and threaten law-abiding Americans and civil rights leaders, such as Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.  It argues that domestic spying without judicial oversight “jeopardizes the foundations of a free and domestic society,” and current NSA surveillance infringes on the groups’ international civil and human rights work.  The brief also cites court decisions protecting the right to legal advocacy “on behalf of the rights of members of an unpopular minority,” which can be chilled and compromised by domestic surveillance (NAACP v. Button, 1963).

 

<p>The business leaders brief was filed by Jenner & Block LLP on behalf of senior executives at HarperCollins Publishers (a subsidiary of News Corporation), Meadowbrook Lane Capital, Rustic Canyon Partners and Domini Social Investments, among others.  The brief argues that illegal domestic spying can chill international communications and the free flow of information “on which thousands of American businesses depend for their lifeblood.”

 

<p>These amicus briefs come after disclosures by the Justice Department indicating that the domestic spying program may be broader than it originally acknowledged.  On April 6, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales refused to rule out warrantless surveillance of purely domestic phone calls in congressional testimony, a departure from earlier assertions by the Bush Administration that the program monitored only international calls.

 

<p>The Justice Department is expected to file its response to CCR by May 19.
