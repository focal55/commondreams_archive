<p>WASHINGTON - June 19 - Sixteen top fashion designers, including Carmen 
March, Antonio Pernas and Jocomomola [1], showed that they believe in 
substance as well as style at a glittering catwalk show in Madrid, 
today, when they unveiled one-off creations designed to avoid the use of 
toxic chemicals which are currently widely used in clothing. Fashion 
giants Mango and Camper also joined the initiative by committing to 
phase out dangerous chemicals from their lines.

<p>At 'Moda sin Tóxicos', a catwalk show organised by Greenpeace, the 
designers joined in the lobby to phase out chemicals which can harm the 
immune and nervous system, affect genital development, cause 
reproductive disorders and cancer [2] - and called for their replacement 
with safer alternatives.

<p>Meanwhile, high-street fashion giant Mango announced a long-term 
commitment to remove hazardous chemicals from its entire production 
world-wide, following talks with Greenpeace. Mallorcan family 
firm-turned-global brand Camper, too, is going to stop using dangerous 
substances in its shoes, while Inditex (owner of Zara, Massimo Dutti and 
other stores), supported designers in the search for toxic-free fabrics.

<p>Helen Perivier, Greenpeace International toxics campaigner, said: "These 
fashion leaders work in a highly competitive industry, and are keen to 
put environmental and health concerns at the heart of their priorities. 
Innovative small businesses like theirs must currently go to 
extraordinary lengths to find materials that do not contain harmful 
chemicals; what they should be getting are guarantees that chemicals on 
the market are safe."

<p>It was a well-dressed wake-up call to grey-suited types in Brussels, who 
later this year will vote on new rules to govern the chemical industry. 
This autumn, the EU will decide on the fate of the new chemicals 
regulation called REACH [3]. At the heart of the debate is whether the 
new law will give a clear signal to industry to substitute hazardous 
chemicals with safer alternatives or not. Currently, thousands of 
chemicals are used in consumer products with little or no health or 
safety assessments, leading to widespread contamination. An unborn baby 
may now be exposed to 100 man-made chemicals before it is even born.

<p>Chemical producers have mobilised a strong opposition to REACH in 
Brussels, losing no opportunity to undermine its power to protect human 
health and the environment. In contrast, many other companies which use 
chemicals in their products see advantages in a REACH that could 
guarantee safer materials.

<p>Commenting on the catwalk show, Mario Rodríguez, Greenpeace Spain 
Campaigns Director, said: "The beautiful clothes that we have seen today 
prove that it is possible to avoid toxic chemicals in clothing and still 
be stylish. We urge the EU to ensure that this unique event will one day 
be the norm; so that we can be sure that all our clothes have been made 
without using chemicals that can harm our health and our environment."
