<p>WASHINGTON - January 13 - Amnesty International (AI) experts will brief United Nations (U.N.) officials on the dangers of arms brokering and the need for clearly defined export criteria during the U.N. preparatory meeting on small arms and light weapons on Monday, January 16, from 1:15 to 2:45 p.m. in Conference Room 2 at the U.N. headquarters on First Avenue at 46th Street in New York City. Additionally, AI experts from more than ten countries will be available for comment on negotiation developments.

<p>During the briefing, Brian Wood, Research and Policy Manager for Military, Security and Police Transfers at Amnesty International's London headquarters (see biographical information below), will address the legal and logistical challenges to eliminating troublesome arms brokering, a practice that often fuels deadly conflicts and gross human rights abuses. Colby Goodman, lead staff of Amnesty International USA's (AIUSA) Control Arms Campaign, will also be on hand to comment.

<p>The current U.N. meeting, which concludes January 20th, begins the negotiations for the July 2006 Review Conference on the illicit transfer of weapons such as assault rifles and shoulder-fired missiles. There, delegates will review the Program of Action (PoA), a voluntary agreement adopted by all U.N. member states in July 2001 at the U.N. Conference on Preventing, Combating, and Eradicating the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects.

<p>AI believes the PoA, while beneficial in many regards, lacks the specificity necessary to hold governments accountable when they export arms to gross human rights abusers. AI is also pushing governments to take stronger actions on arms brokering. To make the PoA more effective, the organization is calling on the U.S. conference representatives to support the inclusion of specific arms export criteria.

<p>In addition to the briefing and ongoing analysis, AI representatives will hold an open screening of Lord of War, a recent film highlighting the dangerous exploits of a fictional arms broker played by Nicolas Cage. The reception, comments, and screening will take place at the U.N. headquarters starting at 5:45 p.m. on Tuesday, January 17 at the Dag Hammarskjold Auditorium.

<p>The following AI experts will be available during the conference to discuss proposed actions to the PoA and ways to strengthen controls for arms brokering and transfers:

<p>Colby Goodman, Lead Staff of AIUSA's Control Arms Campaign (mobile: 202-812-5565), represents the organization before the U.S. government and diplomatic community on issues related to human rights, arms control, and military training.  Before joining AIUSA, Goodman was a Research Assistant with the Arms Division at Human Rights Watch, where he supported global advocacy efforts on small arms and light weapons proliferation and researched irresponsible and illegal arms transporting and brokering. He has written testimony for hearings in both the U.S. Congress and the U.N. and has been interviewed on documentaries examining arms trafficking.

<p>Brian Wood, Amnesty International Research and Policy Manager for Military, Security and Police Transfers, is Amnesty International's foremost expert on arms brokering and transporting. Wood co-authored The Arms Fixers, a book detailing the methods used to traffic arm and has written numerous reports on the human rights impact of the largely unregulated arms trade. Wood has also served as an expert witness to the U.N. on arms embargo violations. His most recent January 2006 AI report focused on the effects of arms trafficking in the Democratic Republic of Congo.

Susan Waltz, Professor at the University of Michigan's Gerald R. Ford School of Public Policy, is a specialist in human rights and international affairs. She serves as chair of AIUSA's military security and police transfers working group and has been involved in international efforts to promote global standards on the small arms trade. Waltz served on Amnesty International's International Executive Committee from 1993 to 1999. She is author of Human Rights and Reform: Changing the Face of North African Politics (1995) and has recently published a series of articles on the historical origins of international human rights instruments.
