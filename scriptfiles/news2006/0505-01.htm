<p>WASHINGTON - May 5 - New estimates from the  Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center (TPC)  show that the $70 billion tax-cut reconciliation package  reportedly agreed to by House and Senate negotiators will offer  virtually no benefits to low- and moderate-income households, but  shower high-income households with very large tax cuts.  The  Center has issued a brief report summarizing the TPC findings.</p>
<p>   The 20 percent of households in the middle of the income  spectrum would receive an average of just $20 in tax benefits  from the package if it were fully in effect in 2006, TPC found.   In contrast, the top one percent of households would receive an  average of $13,800 apiece, and households with annual incomes of  more than $1 million would receive an average tax cut of $42,000  apiece.</p>
<p>   &quot;The disparities in this bill are enormous.  While middle- class households will receive a tax break that's barely big  enough to buy a few gallons of gas, millionaires will receive a  tax break that's big enough to buy a new Mercedes or Lexus,&quot;  noted Joel Friedman, senior fellow at the Center and author of  the Center's report.</p>
<p>   The tax reconciliation agreement, whose formal announcement is  expected next week, reportedly includes a two-year extension of  capital gains and dividend tax cuts, a one-year extension of  relief from the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT), and a proposal to  lift the income limits that apply to converting retirement funds  to Roth IRAs.</p>
<p>   More than half (55 percent) of the package's benefits would  flow to the 4 percent of households that have incomes above  $200,000.  In contrast, just 5 percent of the benefits would flow  to the 77 percent of households that have incomes below $75,000.</p>
<p>   The reconciliation agreement provides such large tax breaks to  the highest income households largely because of the capital  gains and dividend tax cuts, which the Administration and  Congressional leaders pushed hard to include in the bill.  Nearly  half (45 percent) of the benefit of extending these tax cuts  would go to households with incomes of more than $1 million,  according to Tax Policy Center estimates.  The benefits of the  AMT and Roth IRA provisions are also sharply skewed to higher- income households, providing nearly all their benefits to  households with incomes above $100,000.</p>
