<p>AMHERST, Massachusetts - April 19 - Leaders in media, politics, education and technology will 
examine the future and sustainability of journalism, democracy, and communities 
in the Internet age at a conference at the University of Massachusetts Amherst 
this summer.

<p>Helen Thomas, the dean of White House correspondents, will be a featured 
speaker, along with leaders in Internet news such as Boston.com Editor Teresa 
Hanafin and veteran journalist Tom Stites, and political leaders such as Common 
Cause's Chellie Pingree. For an updated list of other participants and 
attendees, see www.mediagiraffe.org/wiki/.

<p>"Democracy & Independence: Sharing News and Politics in a Connected World" is 
scheduled for June 29-July 1 at UMass Amherst, right before the 230th 
anniversary of the Declaration of Independence signing. Sponsors include The 
Boston Globe, MassLive.com, The Republican newspaper, Omidyar Network, the New 
England Press Association, and the UMass Office of Research Affairs. 
Christopher Lydon, host of Radio Open Source, an Internet-centered nightly 
radio interview show focused on media, arts, politics and culture, will 
broadcast live from Amherst to more than 30 public-radio stations nationwide.

<p>"It's a combination roundtable summit, workshop and conference on how the Web 
and multimedia technologies are redefining journalism, politics, democracy and 
communities," says Norman Sims, a Journalism professor and principal researcher 
on The Media Giraffe Project, a non-partisan, interdisciplinary effort at the 
Amherst campus. "We're creating a crossover meeting place for leading thinkers 
in four arenas: media, education, politics and education."

<p>The New England Press Association (NEPA) and Corante Media Hub are among 
co-conveners of the summit. NEPA support includes sponsoring summit 
participation by Helen Thomas, who covered the White House for UPI longer than 
any other living journalist and now writes a column for Hearst Newspapers. 
Thomas. forthcoming book is: "Watchdogs of Democracy? The Waning Washington 
Press Corps and How It Has Failed the Public."

<p>"Internet technology and our changing culture are undermining the business of 
print and broadcast media," says Bill Densmore, director and editor of the 
Media Giraffe Project. "We intend that the Amherst summit produce specific 
ideas for sustaining the independent watchdog journalism necessary for vibrant, 
participatory democracy."

<p>There will be panels, discussions, demonstrations and workshops on specific 
projects under way nationwide that use media in innovative, sustainable ways, 
Densmore says. A "Citizen Media Boot Camp" will present case studies of 
emerging Web-based community news efforts in a how-to format. A "Media Cafe" 
will provide a constant meeting place for informal discussions and ad-hoc 
presentations.

<p>"Constituencies from mainstream and alternative media rarely meet together," 
says Sims. "This conference has the potential to bridge the gap between new and 
traditional media." Participants will include traditional and citizen 
journalists, political strategists, educators, media technology researchers, 
bloggers, and citizens who want "how-to" knowledge about participatory media.

<p>The Media Giraffe Project is using a Web site, book and film projects, and 
events like the June conference to spotlight above-the-crowd individuals making 
innovative, sustainable use of media to foster participatory democracy and 
community. Some of the more than 300 "Giraffe prospects" identified so far will 
be at the UMass gathering.

<p>:Democracy & Independence" will explore changes in the structure of the U.S. 
media industry, the impact of the Internet on its financing, new relationships 
among creators and consumers of news, and how democracy is affected. The event 
starts June 28 with a limited-enrollment roundtable summit followed June 
29.July 1 by a four-track conference. It is designed for:

<p>* Traditional media strategists, editors and practitioners<br>


* Elected officials, political and public-policy strategists<br>


* Info-tech pioneers and entrepreneurs<br>


* Operators of local-news Web sites and blogs<br>


* Podcasters and vloggers dealing with news, political, and public-policy 
issues<br>


* Academic researchers and students<br>


* Citizens who want "how-to" knowledge about participatory media<br>
