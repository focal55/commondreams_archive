<p>WASHINGTON - January 25 - Campaign for America's  Future co-director Roger Hickey today praised the announcement of  the newly expanded Americans United. </p>
<p>   &quot;Americans United to Protect Social Security - which  successfully mobilized to stop Bush's Wall Street Social Security  plan - grew directly out of our work to build a nationwide  activist coalition to oppose Social Security privatization,&quot; said  Hickey. &quot;This new campaign, organized with a broader issue  mandate, will build on and amplify the work of the Campaign for  America's Future and many other groups around the issues of  cleaning up corruption in government; health care; energy  independence and the other 'kitchen table' economic issues  Americans care about.&quot; </p>
<p>   Americans United today released a new television ad about  cleaning up corruption in the wake of the Jack Abramoff  corruption scandal, reinforcing a targeted campaign by the  Campaign for America's Future and the Public Campaign Action Fund  in the communities of tainted members of Congress. </p>
<p>   The Campaign for America's Future's &quot;Corrupt Congress&quot; project  has targeted congressional corruption because big money payoffs,  both legal and illegal, give undue weight to special interests in  the halls of Congress.  Payoffs produce legislation that  undermines American's retirement security, hastens the loss of  good jobs and prevents progress on health care, education and  investment in a healthy economy. </p>
<p>   &quot;The disastrous Bush prescription drug benefit for seniors is  a prime example of how special interest money creates bad policy  that undermines security for average Americans,&quot; said Hickey.   &quot;The Campaign for America's Future looks forward to working with  Americans United to improve the prescription drug law, but  progress on getting drug prices under control requires that we  find ways to limit the influence of big money in our Congress and  in our political system. We will work for economic change - while  cleaning up corruption in our democratic system that weakens the  voice of average Americans.&quot; </p>
<p>   Three Houston television stations recently began airing a  targeted television ad that links embattled Rep. Tom DeLay, R- Texas, to corruption after considerable public pressure and  negotiations. The stations' decision to air the spot marks a  turning point in the controversy, which began when Rep. DeLay  threatened to sue media outlets if they aired the earlier ad. The  Campaign for America's Future and the Public Campaign Action  Fund, the two public interest groups that joined forces to run  the spots, vigorously fought back. </p>
<p>   The groups unveiled $115,000 in new television, radio and  billboard ads targeting Rep. DeLay and Rep. Bob Ney, R-Ohio, for  their ties to corruption earlier this month, kicking off a  yearlong campaign to clean up Congress. Speaker Dennis Hastert,  R-Ill., asked Rep. Ney to leave his leadership post as chair of  the House Administration Committee after the ads aired in  southeastern Ohio. </p>
