<b>HUWAIDA ARRAF</b><br />
<b><a href="mailto:rasalti@aol.com">RASHA SALTI</a></b><br />
<b><a href="mailto:medea@globalexchange.org">MEDEA BENJAMIN</a></b><br />
<b>SAMAH IDRISS</b><br />

<b>WADIH AL ASMAR</b><br />
All of these activists are participating in a civilian peace convoy to the south of Lebanon. More information is at <a href="http://www.LebanonSolidarity.org">Lebanon Solidarity</a>.<br />
<br />
Arraf and Shapiro are co-founders of the International Solidarity Movement. Shapiro said today: "Israel has in effect depopulated the south of Lebanon. Many here are determined that Israel should not be able to tell the Lebanese people where they can and cannot go in their country. That's part of the motivation for this unarmed civilian resistance in Lebanon. We will be having a convoy from Beirut beginning on Saturday and going to the south of the country with relief supplies. Many are aware that Israeli leaders have in the past made statements that Israel should extend up to the Latani River."<br />
<br />
Benjamin, who is a cofounder of Global Exchange and the women's peace group CodePink, was recently in Amman where she met with Iraqi parliament leaders and in Syria where she saw Lebanese who had fled to Syria from the Israeli bombing of Lebanon.<br />
