<p>WASHINGTON - DECEMBER 5 - News accounts of the  Baker-Hamilton Iraq Study Group (ISG) report, to be released  tomorrow, Dec. 7, confirm that its recommendations will be a  political compromise out of touch with current reality in Iraq,  according to the nation's largest grassroots peace organization.</p>
<p>   &quot;The civil war in Iraq is spiraling out of control and it's  unclear whether the government of Prime Minister al Maliki can  survive, yet the report will call for 'gradual' withdrawal of  troops,&quot; said Kevin Martin, executive director of Peace Action.  &quot;It's no time for gradual anything. We need bold and creative  actions to dramatically change the dynamic in Iraq, not tepid  recommendations for political consumption at home.&quot;</p>

<p>   &quot;The first necessary step is an immediate cease-fire and an  announcement that the U.S. will be withdrawing its troops, on a  timetable, and that we have no plans to leave behind military  bases or to control Iraqi oil,&quot; added Martin, &quot;but by all  accounts this will be noticeably absent from the  recommendations.&quot; Other recommendations that would be necessary  to address the rapidly deteriorating situation in Iraq, but will  likely be missing from the Iraq Study Group report, include:</p>
<p>   -- Open negotiations with all factions in Iraq to end the  violence.</p>
<p>   -- Redirection of funds being spent on the occupation toward  an orderly withdrawal of troops.</p>
<p>   -- Prohibition of any new funds from being spent on any new  troop deployment.</p>

<p>   -- Full funding for an Iraqi-led reconstruction of Iraq.</p>
<p>   There is reportedly one idea forthcoming from the ISG that the  peace movement can stand behind: the recommendation for direct  negotiations with Iraq's neighbors, including Syria and Iran. &quot;It  is long past time for the U.S. to build peace and security  through international dialogue and cooperation,&quot; concluded  Martin. &quot;And it would be helpful if the ISG also called for the  UN, Arab League or other international bodies to assist with  negotiations, since the Bush Administration has proven itself  neither adept at nor particularly interested in diplomacy during  its six years in office.&quot;</p>
