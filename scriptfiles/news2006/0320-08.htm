<p>TUCSON, Arizona - March 20 - 
<p><b>WHAT: </b>While Senator Kyl is on recess, Arizona's immigrant and border communities are going to his offices in Tucson and Phoenix to insist that "we are not the enemy; we are part of the solution." The Phoenix march and Tucson rally will emphasize that our communities do not need policies like H.R. 4437 (introduced by Congressman Sensenbrenner and passed by the House in December). Instead, the groups will point out, we need an immigration policy that provides 1) a means for immigrants to attain permanent residency and 2) a border policy that upholds community security and border security. A safe border must also be a just and humane border.

<p><b>WHERE:</b> Tucson--Rally at 7315 N. Oracle Rd (northwest corner of Ina/Oracle)
Phoenix--March begins at St. Agnes Church at 24th and McDowell. Concludes at Senator Kyl's office 2200 East Camelback.

<p><b>WHEN: </b>Friday, March 24, 2006. All events begin at 11:00am

<p><b>WHO: </b>Sponsoring organizations include Border Action Network, No More Deaths, Service Employees International Union, Center for Biological Diversity, Samaritans, Coalicion de Derechos Humanos, Florence Immigrant and Refugee Rights Project, American Friends Service Committee, Arizona Latino Legislative Caucus, Arizona Democratic Progressive Caucus and other Phoenix organizations.

<p><b>WHY:</b> In December the House of Representatives approved the infamous Sensenbrenner bill, H.R. 4437 which would criminalize the estimated 12 million undocumented immigrants in the U.S., those that provide assistance to undocumented immigrants, build a 700-mile border wall and erode due process and judicial review. In early March the Senate took up the debate. Arizona Senator Kyl is not representing his constituents and is calling for measures similar to H.R. 4437. 
Immigrant and border communities across the country are standing up by the tens of thousands to show that we are not criminals or the enemies of this country. "We are not the enemy; we are part of the solution! Rather, we are mothers, fathers, sons, and daughters who want to be a part of this country and its democratic processes. Our work and contributions to this country are permanent; our residency ought to be permanent as well," explains Ana Alicia Casas, Border Action Network member, Tucson immigrant and participant in last week's 300-member delegation that traveled to D.C. to speak with every office of the U.S. Senate. 

<p><b>VISUALS & INTERVIEWS:</b> Immigrant children carrying hundreds of drawings, banners, t-shirts with the message "We are not the enemy; we are part of the solution." Church leaders and immigrant workers and their families will be available for interviews.
