<p>TORONTO - August 14 - The fight against AIDS cannot be won without reducing poverty, the humanitarian organization agency CARE said today. CARE calls upon policymakers and practitioners meeting at the upcoming International AIDS Conference in Toronto to include food and income security&nbsp;&mdash; which are critical means of addressing poverty and the spread of the disease&nbsp;&mdash; in their HIV and AIDS strategies.</p>

<p>"Poverty exacerbates the pandemic, while the pandemic contributes to poverty and inequality.&nbsp; If we are going to succeed in fighting AIDS, something has to change," said CARE Canada's President A. John Watson. "Nutritious foods and a steady income are critical to the health of those living with HIV.&nbsp; If people stay healthy, they can continue working and contributing to their families and their communities. At the same time, if non-infected people are hungry and penniless, they often engage in risky behavior for day to day survival; and this contributes to the spread of AIDS."</p>

<p>CARE works with communities on prevention, treatment, care and support through 150 HIV and AIDS programmes in 40 countries. Communities are ravaged by the vicious cycle created when secure access to nutritious foods and a steady income is denied to people living with, affected by and vulnerable to HIV and AIDS.</p>

<p>Women and girls must be at the center of an effective response to HIV and AIDS. Issues related to gender are inextricably linked with food and income security and HIV and AIDS. By and large, it is women who are responsible for food production and preparation, and caring for families affected by AIDS, yet they have limited earning or negotiation power.</p>

<p>"Ignoring the critical role of women further exacerbates their vulnerability and weakens the fight against AIDS," said Dr. Helene Gayle, CARE USA president and International AIDS Society president and conference co-chair.</p>

<p>CARE representatives from 16 countries will participate in the conference, sharing successes and outlining challenges in developing countries. These experts, from Africa, Asia and Latin America, are available for interviews in the following languages: English, French, Spanish, German, Swahili, Portuguese, Vietnamese and Thai. Biographical and contact information is listed below. In addition, they are speaking at the following events:</p>

<p><strong>Monday, August 14, 6:00 - 8:00 p.m.</strong> "Breaking the Vicious Cycle of Food Insecurity" &mdash;&nbsp;Satellite session, CARE and Project Concern International, Session Room 3.</p>

<p><strong>Tuesday, August 15, 6:00 - 8:00 p.m.</strong> "Coalitions: Innovations in HIV and AIDS Programming" &mdash;&nbsp;Satellite session, CARE, Hope for African Children Initiative, Gates Foundation, the Canadian Coalition on HIV and Youth, Skills Building, Room 2.</p>

<p><strong>Thursday, August 17, 10:45 a.m. - 12:15 p.m.</strong> CARE, ICAD, CHF, World Vision Canada and Oxfam Canada will be holding a satellite session on HIV/AIDS, gender and development. The session will be chaired by Stephen Lewis, the UN Special Envoy on HIV/AIDS in Africa, Session Room 3.</p>
