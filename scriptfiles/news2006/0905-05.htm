<p>WASHINGTON - September 5 - Homeowners residing in the southwestern and Great Plains states are much more likely to
refinance with higher interest rate subprime loans than are those that live in the Pacific or Northwestern
regions, according to a new study released today by the Consumer Federation of America.
<p>“The significant variation of subprime refinance lending between different regions and metropolitan areas
may reflect the extent to which local mortgage markets are competitive and transparent or the existence of
predatory lending and not simply, variations of creditworthy borrowers” said Allen Fishbein, Director of
Credit and Housing Policy at Consumer Federation of America (CFA).
<p>The study examined 4.9 million mortgage originations in all 50 states and more than 300 metropolitan areas.
The loan level data was obtained from lenders from reports they are required to submit under the Federal
Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA). The CFA analysis found the prevalence of higher subprime
lending among certain minority groups but also provides a comprehensive look at subprime lending patterns
for metropolitan areas, states and regions across the country.
<p>The national 2005 HMDA data is due out later this month and is expected to show higher levels of reported
higher-cost lending than in 2004 as well as significant pricing disparities for African Americans and Latino
borrowers compared to other borrower groups. Some portion of the year-to-year increase can be attributed to
a changing interest rate environment, but the HMDA reporting provided to the public cannot discern the
extent to which the increase can be explained by the changes in the interest rate yield curve alone.
Nevertheless, interpretations of year-to-year changes in the volume of higher-priced subprime loans should be
treated with caution.
<p>Among the study’s key findings:
<ul>
<li>The share of refinance lending that is subprime is twice as high (over 36 percent of refinance lending) in
the Great Plains (Iowa, Kansas, Missouri and Nebraska) and Southwest (Arkansas, Louisiana, New
Mexico, Oklahoma and Texas) Census Bureau regions than in the Pacific (Arizona, California, Hawaii
and Nevada) and Northwest (Alaska, Idaho, Oregon and Washington) where fewer than one in five (18
percent) of refinance mortgages are high-cost. In 2005, these loans had interest rates of about 8 percent. <br>
<br>
</li>
<li>Gulf Coast and Great Plains states had the highest incidence of subprime refinance lending. More than
half (51.8 percent) of refinance loans in Mississippi were subprime. More than two-fifths of refinance
loans in Oklahoma (44.3 percent), Alabama (41.6 percent), Nebraska (41.4 percent) and Louisiana (40.0
percent) were subprime loans.<br>
<br>
</li>
<li> The ten cities with the highest incidence of subprime refinance lending (Muncie IN, Jackson MS, Decatur
AL, Muskegon MI, Battle Creek MI, Longview TX, El Paso TX McCallen TX and Brownsville TX) were
more than five times more likely to receive subprime refinance loans than the ten cities with the lowest
incidence of subprime refinance lending (San Francisco, Santa Rosa, San Jose, Santa Barbara, Napa, San
Luis Obispo, Santa Ana, Oxnard and San Diego CA and Boulder CO).<br>
<br>
</li>
<li> Subprime Loans Increase, Higher-Cost Loans Increase Faster: The share of subprime loans (those more
than 3 percent above comparable Treasury notes) increased by 79.9 percent between 2004 and 2005 from
14.7 percent of refinance mortgages in 2004 to 26.5 percent of refinance loans in 2005. Over the same
period, refinance loans priced at more than 5 percent above Treasury securities more than doubled from
4.2 percent of refinance lending to 8.8 percent of refinance mortgages in 2005. Some of the increase is be
explained by a changing interest rate environment, but increase is large nonetheless.<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>African Americans and Latinos were more likely than whites to receive subprime refinance loans. Nearly
half (48.9 percent) of African American refinance borrowers and more than one third (32.6 percent) of
Latino borrowers received subprime loans compared to less than a quarter (23.0 percent) of white
refinance borrowers. </li>
</ul>
<p>The CFA research helps to provide a local context to the national release of data by the federal government.
CFA examined over 2.5 million conventional refinance mortgages reported by over 22 lenders and their 312
affiliates in 317 Metropolitan Statistical Areas including at least one MSA in each state. Geographic pricing
variation could represent differential regional creditworthiness or other legitimate price determinants.
However, the size of the variation between localities and regions warrants a closer look by banking regulators
and other enforcement officials to ensure that these differences can be explained solely as a function of riskbased
pricing.
<p>CFA’s findings raise important public policy concerns especially as adjustable rate mortgage rates rise and
monthly payments reset upward this year and next. The subprime refinance market provides higher cost
credit predominantly to borrowers who are unserved by the prime market and is fertile ground for abusive
predatory lending practices. Growing delinquency and foreclosure rates for these loans demonstrate that some
borrowers are taking out mortgages with unsuitable terms and payments.
Patrick Woodall, CFA’s Senior Researcher, said: “Homeowners who borrowed with subprime ARMs or
exotic refinance mortgages in 2005 could face strikingly high payment shocks down the road that could put
their homes at risk.”
