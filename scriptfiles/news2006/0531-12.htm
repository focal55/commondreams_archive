<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --> WASHINGTON - May 31 - The non-profit Clean Air  Watch today decried the Bush administration's decision to  reaffirm the bad, industry-friendly mercury air pollution rule  initially set in March 2005.</p>
<p>   &quot;The Bush administration is ignoring science - and the obvious  potential for better pollution cleanup,&quot; said Frank O'Donnell,  president of Clean Air Watch.</p>
<p>   &quot;This is a classic case of the Bush administration harming the  environment by currying favor with a powerful special interest -  the coal-burning electric power industry. This decision means  power companies can continue to pump this poison into the air for  many extra years, unless states take swifter cleanup action,&quot;  O'Donnell noted.</p>
<p>   The facts -- and developments in the past year -- demonstrate  this rule is a gift to the industry, O'Donnell added.</p>
<p>   When EPA first issued the rule, it claimed that no  commercially available pollution controls were available to clean  up poisonous mercury.  Since that time, various commercial  contracts have been announced -- giving the lie to the EPA plan.   (See some examples at <a href="http://releases.usnewswire.com/redir.asp?ReleaseID=66683&Link=http://www.adaes.com">http://www.adaes.com</a> )</p>
<p>   When EPA first issued the rule, it also claimed that its &quot;cap- and-trade&quot; plan would be just dandy -- and that local pollution  controls weren't needed -- because most of the mercury was  allegedly coming from somewhere else.   Since that time, EPA has  found (in a study of Steubenville, Ohio), that localized  reductions in mercury emissions would lead to less mercury in the  local environment -- thus giving the lie to the cap-and-trade  plan.</p>
<p>   &quot;The irony here is that the pro-industry Bush plan has  triggered a rebellion by states,&quot; O'Donnell said.  He pointed to  a story in CQ Weekly which noted that 21 states -- some with  Republican governors, including New York, Maryland, Minnesota and  Connecticut -- have served notice to the administration that they  will produce their own mercury cleanup plans.</p>
