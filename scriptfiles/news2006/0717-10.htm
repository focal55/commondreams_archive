<p>MILWAUKEE, Wisconsin - July 17 - When U.S. Senator Russ Feingold was in Iowa on Saturday and Sunday, he announced the creation of the Patriot Corps – a campaign worker training program, from the Progressive Patriots Fund, set to train, place, and support 15 campaign workers in key races across the country. Feingold announced the program at a listening session in Dubuque, Iowa on Saturday.  Feingold spent this past weekend in Iowa meeting with local activists and holding a fundraiser for the Iowa State House Democratic Caucus.

<p>The Patriot Corps is part of the Progressive Patriots Fund - an organization formed by Feingold to promote a progressive reform agenda and to support candidates across the country.

<p>Starting today, the Progressive Patriots Fund will be accepting applications for field staff to join the Corps.  Prospective candidates can submit resumes and receive more information on the program at <a href="http://www.progressivepatriotsfund.com" target="_new">www.progressivepatriotsfund.com</a>. Once chosen, Corps members will participate in an extensive, multi-day training program, before being placed in key campaigns in Wisconsin and across the country.

<p>“My campaigns have always been anchored by strong grassroots field efforts,” Feingold said Saturday.  “We can return a progressive majority to the congress and state houses this fall, and I’m excited that the Patriot Corps will help provide trained field organizers to targeted campaigns across the country.” 

<p>Resumes will be accepted through the week of August 7th.  Placements will be announced in early September.
