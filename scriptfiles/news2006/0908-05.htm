<p>WASHINGTON - September 8 - Two 
national watchdog groups today warned that voters may be more turned off than 
properly informed if advertising in the state’s Supreme Court races continues to 
degenerate into mudslinging between rival interest groups. &nbsp;A series of 
recently unveiled advertising efforts by interest groups include some negative 
spots that won’t educate or inform voters, the groups said, but rather serve to 
misinform voters about the proper role of the courts. <BR>&nbsp;<BR>“As the 
election approaches, Washington’s judicial candidates should take the high road 
and ensure that the races do not degenerate as others have around the country,” 
said Deborah Goldberg, director of the Democracy Program at the Brennan Center 
for Justice. &nbsp;“Negative ads from special interest groups should be 
denounced by the candidates as contrary to the value of fairness they stand for 
as potential judges.”<BR>&nbsp;<BR>A series of new ads, both radio and 
television, hit the airwaves in recent days across Washington 
state:<BR>&nbsp;<BR>* A TV ad airing [<FONT color=#0000ff><U><A

by an independent group identified as “Americans Tired of Lawsuit Abuse” – an 
interest group based in Virginia - attacks Chief Justice Gerry Alexander by 
saying that “The Andress decision let my son’s killer walk free…..if Justice 
Alexander hadn’t voted for this decision, this wouldn’t have happened.” 
&nbsp;Four other judges agreed with Alexander’s majority &nbsp;vote. 
<BR>&nbsp;<BR>* A radio ad paid for by the Building Industry Association of 
Washington (BIAW) focuses on the age of Chief Justice Alexander: “When it's your 
time, you know it. You're tired, you get sloppy, you make mistakes. &nbsp;Take 
Chief Justice Gerry &nbsp;Alexander, he's been a judge since Nixon was 
president. In recent years, &nbsp;Alexander has not only lost a step or two, 
he's done real damage." <BR><BR>* A separate radio ad paid for a group called 
“Constitution First” charges that “Marriage is under attack in Washington 
state." The ad attacks Justice Tom Chambers for his vote in a recent same-sex 
marriage case, even though the same-sex marriage ban was upheld by the 
Washington Supreme Court earlier this year. <BR>&nbsp;<BR>A 2005 analysis by the 
Brennan Center and Justice at Stake shows that 58 percent of the attack ads in 
the 2004 state Supreme Court campaigns nationwide were sponsored by outside 
groups (31 percent were paid for by a political party, and only 11 percent by 
the candidates themselves).<BR>&nbsp;<BR>“Attack ads seek to pressure courts to 
answer to special interests instead of the law and the constitution,” said Bert 
Brandenburg, executive director of Justice at Stake, a nonpartisan national 
campaign working to keep American courts fair and impartial. 
<BR>&nbsp;<BR>Interest groups have also been busy trying to corner candidates 
through aggressive questionnaires—like that developed by the “Faith and Freedom 
Network”— which asked judicial candidates to give their views on three U.S. 
Supreme Court decisions and then issued a pass/fail grade based on their 
answers.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>Justice at Stake and the Brennan Center support voter 
education efforts such as those developed by the sponsors of 
votingforjudges.org, which place a premium on candidate qualifications and 
experience rather than their personal views on hot button political or legal 
issues they may have to rule on. <!-- #EndEditable -->
