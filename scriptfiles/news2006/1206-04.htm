<p>WASHINGTON - December 6 - Members of ACORN will conduct press conferences at the U.S. Capitol and three cities around the country on Thursday, Dec. 7, to  announce the organization's next steps to pressure FEMA's to comply with a federal judge's orders to &quot;immediately'' resume making housing benefits available to 11,000 survivors of hurricanes Katrina  and Rita.
<p>   Locations are: </p>
<p>   In Washington, D.C., 10:30 a.m. (EST), 2220 Rayburn House  Office Building</p>
<p>   -- Speakers: Rep. Maxine Waters (D-CA); Rep. Al Green (D-TX);  Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee (D-TX); Rep. Barbara Lee (D-CA); Robert  Coakley, ACORN Katrina Survivors Association; Mary Spencer, ACORN  DC Leader </p>
<p>   In New Orleans, 11 a.m., (CST) ACORN National Headquarters,  1024 Elysian Fields Ave.</p>
<p>   In Houston, 11:30 a.m. (CST) Houston FEMA office, 2575 W.  Belfort  In Little Rock, ACORN Office, 2101 S. Main St. </p>
<p>   Survivors of Hurricane Katrina and plaintiffs in the lawsuit  will speak about their struggles over FEMA housing issues, and  their work with public officials to pressure the agency. </p>
<p>   On Tuesday, FEMA filed a motion to appeal the decision, but it  is still under Court order to resume housing aid. ACORN's  attorneys filed a motion in with Judge Richard J. Leon on Tuesday  asking him to compel FEMA to produce a compliance plan. </p>
<p>   &quot;FEMA is still under a court order restore the housing support  they illegally terminated. They haven't moved to do so yet --  even though more families are now facing eviction as December  rents come due. ACORN members will continue push FEMA to put a  quick procedure in place to get the people the assistance we were  wrongly denied,&quot; said Wanda Jones, a Katrina Survivor and ACORN  member in Houston whose housing assistance was terminated last  summer. &quot;It is long past due for FEMA to live up to its  responsibilities and help families get on their road home to  recovery.&quot;</p>
<p>   The court ordered the aid restored retroactively, so affected  families are to receive checks for past payments from Sept. 1 to  now, and continued assistance until February 2007, or until FEMA  gives them adequate notice of why they were ineligible. The  ruling affects 11,000 families, mostly in Texas and Louisiana,  who received FEMA rental assistance. </p>
<p>   ACORN, a national community organization based in New Orleans,  has organized thousands of dislocated Katrina survivors into  local chapters. ACORN has pushed local and federal officials and  lawmakers to provide Katrina survivors the assistance needed to  take care of their families and rebuild their homes. In New  Orleans, ACORN's Home Clean-Out Program has saved over 1,800  homes from decay, and the group and its partners are rebuilding  homes in low and moderate income neighborhoods, while pushing for  fair and inclusive rebuilding plans.
