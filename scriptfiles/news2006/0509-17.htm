<p>EUGENE, Oregon - May 9 - Wildland firefighters called on Congress today to defeat H.R. 4200, a controversial logging bill headed to a vote in the House of Representatives soon, saying it fails to address the urgent needs of both wildland firefighters and rural communities.  

 

<p>In a recent letter to Members of Congress, Firefighters United for Safety, Ethics and Ecology (FUSEE) raised concerns that H.R. 4200 could increase fire risks and undermine efforts to reduce hazardous fire conditions near communities. 

 

<p>“H.R. 4200 does not help protect communities before severe wildfires ignite, and could increase the risk of wildfire by diverting resources away from necessary fuels reduction around homes to logging in the backcountry,” said Rich Fairbanks, FUSEE Executive Committee Member. 

 

<p>Post-fire logging followed by industrial tree planting can create a volatile mix of logging debris, invasive weeds, and highly-flammable young trees. Wildfires are prone to sudden “blow-ups” of extreme fire behavior when they enter young plantations, causing increased wildfire risks and safety hazards to firefighters.

 

<p>“Fire-prone plantations created by H.R. 4200 will compel firefighters to aggressively fight all future fires, even in fire-dependent ecosystems during conditions that may be ideal for managing fire for fuels reduction and forest restoration benefits,” said Timothy Ingalsbee, executive director of FUSEE.  “The sooner communities are prepared for fire, the sooner firefighters can use all the tools of modern fire management, including prescribed burning and wildland fire use.”

 

<p>Firefighters United for Safety, Ethics, and Ecology (FUSEE) is a Eugene based, non-profit organization of wildland firefighters and other fire management specialists promoting firefighter and community safety, and ethical and ecological fire management.  

 

<p>A copy of FUSEE’s letter to Congress is available at http://www.fusee.org/ffighters/docs/FUSEE_FERRA_ltr.pdf 

<p>A teleconference featuring firefighters and Rep. Tom Udall will take place today at 2 pm ET.  The dial in number is (800) 406-5345   Passcode 5743529

<p><b>Remarks by Timothy Ingalsbee, Firefighters United for Safety, Ethics, and Ecology
</b>
<p>Thank you.  My name is Timothy Ingalsbee, executive director of FUSEE: that stands for Firefighters United for Safety, Ethics, and Ecology. FUSEE is a non-profit organization of wildland firefighters and other fire management specialists promoting safe, ethical, ecological fire management.  I welcome you to check out our website at www.fusee.org for more information about our organization.

 

<p>In addition to being the Executive Director of FUSEE, I am also an instructor at the University of Oregon where I teach courses about fire, and the secretary of the board of directors for the Association for Fire Ecology.  I began my career in fire 25 years ago as a wildland firefighter for the U.S. Forest Service and National Park Service, fighting fires in some of the remotest wild places all across the Pacific Northwest. 

 

<p>In 1987, I was on one of the first fire crews to arrive at the Silver Fire burning in southern Oregon.  My crew toiled 14 hours a day putting out flames smoldering near giant old-growth pine trees.  

 

<p>Using nothing but shovels, pulaskis, dirt and spit, me and my crew left those stands with a lot of pride knowing that we had saved many of these big old trees.  However, when I returned to those same sites a couple years later, I was shocked to find giant stumps and slash piles where the giant trees had recently stood. 

 

<p>I could not understand why the agency had logged the survivors of wildfire.  Why had the Forest Service called in my crew to fight that fire to protect that forest only to cut down the trees soon after we had left?  

 

<p>That was the first time I learned about a thing called “post-fire salvage logging,” or seen the result of a Forest Service so-called “fire recovery project.” 

 

<p>The bitter irony of this story is that 15 years later during the Biscuit Fire in 2002, all of the Silver Fire area reburned, and the areas that were logged and replanted burned more severely—in fact, most of the tree plantations were totally wiped out.

 

<p>Young, densely-stocked, even-aged timber plantations are prone to sudden “blow-ups” of extreme fire behavior, and can start crownfires in adjacent uncut old-growth stands.  Even low-intensity fires can totally destroy a young plantation, creating the proverbial “moonscape” of a treeless, blackened stand.

 

<p>Post-fire logging and planting does not “recover” a burned forest, but rather, sets it up for future high-severity burning. These plantations are also extremely hazardous for firefighters to defend.  

 

<p>This is why wildland firefighters have a stake in this debate, because not only will HR 4200 create more hazardous fire conditions, but it will divert financial resources away from one of the most urgent needs of society: community wildfire protection. 

 

<p>Inspired by Aldo Leopold’s Land Ethic, one of our mottos in FUSEE is: A thing is right when it contributes to the safety of firefighters and the public, to ethical and efficient use of public resources, and to ecological restoration of fire-dependent ecosystems.  

 

<p>HR 4200 is wrong because it fails on each of these counts: it will lead to unsafe, more hazardous conditions for firefighters and communities, it will waste taxpayer resources on subsidized logging and tree planting operations, and will further degrade the ecological health of public forest lands for the sake of private logging interests.

 

<p>That is why today FUSEE has sent a letter to every member of Congress urging them to oppose HR 4200.  We need proactive fire management, not reactive post-fire logging.

 

<p>Thank you very much; that concludes my statement.

 

 

 

<p><b>Statement by Rich Fairbanks, Firefighters United for Safety, Ethics, and Ecology
</b>
<p>My name is Richard Fairbanks. I recently retired from the U.S. Forest Service after thirty-two years with the agency.  My last major assignment was as interdisciplinary team leader for the Biscuit Fire Recovery Project in southern Oregon.  Before then, I was team leader for the Willamette National Forest’s Fire Management Plan, as well as a team member on the Warner Fire Recovery Project and several similar projects.  Prior to that, I spent twenty years working on suppression crews and hotshot crews, fighting fires throughout the West. I am currently a Forest and Fire Program Associate for The Wilderness Society and executive board member of FUSEE.  I am going to talk briefly today about why, from my perspective, Representative Walden’s bill is one of misplaced priorities. 

 

<p>First and most importantly, science has shown and my eyes have seen that forests are fully capable of regenerating after a fire.  

 

<p>After most forest fires, some trees within the burned area survive. Contrary to popular belief, the whole forest is not dead and charred.  Silviculturists recognize that even if only a few of these trees survive for the long term, they are vital to renewing the forest.  The offspring of these survivors are often highly fire resistant and are much better adapted to a particular site than trees that would be brought in and planted. 

 

<p>One of the things that most concerns me with HR 4200 is that it would allow for the cutting of live green trees if they are “likely to die within five years.” Allowing the Forest Service to predict when a tree might die, will likely lead to unnecessary, devastating logging. When I’ve gone and looked at forests after a fire occurred, many of those “dead” trees were still standing and flourishing – they didn’t know they were dead. The trees that survive a fire assist in regeneration, in some cases they can result in over 6,000 seedlings per acre. With the Forest Service’s limited resources, it just doesn’t make sense to go in and cut them down.  

 

<p>But don’t take my word for it, 169 of the nation’s leading forest scientists have written a letter to Congress opposing HR 4200 because post-fire logging destroys critical wildlife habitat, pollutes watersheds, and delays a forest’s ability to recover naturally. My thirty-two years in the Forest Service confirms their findings.

<p>Of additional concern is the fact that HR 4200 facilitates logging far away from homes and actually accelerates the type of logging projects that can increase fire risk by leaving behind flammable debris, building new roads that lead to more fires, and drying out the forest by logging the largest, fire-resistant trees. With wildfire season upon us, there is a great deal of work to be done to reduce fire risks around communities.  But not only could H.R. 4200 increase fire risk, we also run into the very real problem of resources potentially being diverted from what should be a top priority for the Forest Service -- protecting people’s lives and homes. 

<p>Lastly, Representative Walden’s bill is just not necessary and we certainly don’t need to waive the National Environmental Policy Act to move projects ahead. 

<p>First, federal agencies already have all the legal authorities they need to plan and implement logging projects after fires and other natural disturbances. Forest Service reports show that 34% of the timber volume coming from national forests over the last six years came from post-disturbance logging. 

<p>Second, for the past 15 years I have worked on federal projects governed by the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA).  NEPA requires that agencies collect and interpret data about proposed projects and the impacts they may have on the environment and on communities. NEPA is a vitally important defense against any tendency for Forest Service line officers to make decisions based on inappropriate considerations that are not in the best interests of the land or the public. H.R. 4200 would waive NEPA, which is very dangerous because NEPA is there for a reason – to ensure a transparent process that includes public involvement. Without it, the Forest Service could abuse their authority and move forward on projects without any oversight.
