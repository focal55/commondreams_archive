<p>WASHINGTON - October 17 -  Liberia recently returned to democratic rule after two decades of brutal dictatorship
and a devastating civil war. From October 16 to 18, newly elected Liberian President
Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf will be visiting Washington, D.C., to appeal to U.S. decision
makers and the public for their support of Liberia at this critical time. 

<p>The international community has promised to support Johnson-Sirleaf, pledging
aid to help the country rebuild.  But aid will not be enough to ensure a stable
future for Liberia and its people.  Liberia's economy is currently hamstrung
by an enormous, unjust, and unpayable debt burden. The country's current per
capita debt is $1,000 per person. The per capita annual income is only $83.

<p>Creditors are currently insisting that Liberia pay $1.5 billion in back payments
and accumulated interest before it can become eligible for any debt relief or
cancellation. This in a country whose government operates with an annual budget
of just $80 million. Liberia is part of the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC)
Initiative but has yet to receive any debt relief under the initiative. For more
information, check out this Jubilee USA Network fact sheet.

<p>The following experts are available to comment on her visit and Liberia's debt:

“International rhetoric of support to Africa's first woman president, Ellen Johnson
Sirleaf, must be matched with real action.  There couldn't be a better time to
negotiate the complete cancellation of Liberia's illegitimate debts.”

“Debt is tearing down schools, hospitals and clinics and its effects in Liberia
are more devastating than the civil war that the Liberians have already endured.
If peace is to be consolidated in Liberia, the International community needs
to cancel Liberia's debts so as to give it a fresh development start. Otherwise
the failure of the sitting government to meet basic needs because of the debt
burden will slide the nation back to war.”

"We know the majority of Liberia's debt was incurred under past dictators Samuel
Doe and Charles Taylor. Yet the odious and illegitimate nature of this debt and
resulting arrears has been overlooked by the World Bank and IMF. Instead, these
creditors are claiming $1.5 billion in interest and penalties, when the country
is only able to service at most $100,000 in annual debt payments. The time has
come to immediately cancel Liberia's debt."

<p><b>Gail Hurley</b>, Policy and Advocacy Officer, European Network on Debt and Development
(Eurodad) (322) 543-9063 (o) (Brussels, Belgium); ghurley@eurodad.org
<br>
<br>
"The Norwegian government's recent decision to cancel a few countries' illegitimate
debts points to a way forward in addressing the unjust accumulation of past debt
and arrears. The IMF and World Bank's demand of $1.5 billion from Liberia in
arrears payments represents a step backwards in this dialogue, and we hope that
Liberia and her creditors may come to some better conclusion, while President
Johnson-Sirleaf is in the U.S."
