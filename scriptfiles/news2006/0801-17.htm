<p>WASHINGTON - August 1 - 

<p><b><a href="mailto:naiman@justforeignpolicy.org">ROBERT NAIMAN</a></b>, 
<a href="http://www.JustForeignPolicy.org" target="_new">http://www.JustForeignPolicy.org</a><br>

    Naiman is national coordinator of the new D.C.-based advocacy group 
Just Foreign Policy, which issued a statement today saying: "Under 
international law the UN Security Council is supposed to act to stop 
crimes against peace but [it] cannot do so in this case because it is 
paralyzed by the veto of the Bush administration, which opposes an 
immediate cease-fire and is backed in this position by the United 
Kingdom. However, under resolution 377, 'Uniting for Peace,' the UN 
General Assembly can act when the Security Council fails to do so. This 
procedure has been used 10 times in the history of the UN, often at the 
initiative of the United States." (See: "<a href="http://www.commondreams.org/views06/0727-27.htm" target="_new">A Road to Peace in Lebanon?</a>" 
Jeremy Brecher and Brendan Smith, July 27, 2006)
<p>Naiman said today: "We are circulating a petition calling for the UN 
General Assembly to act to bring about an immediate cease-fire in 
Lebanon, Israel and Gaza. Any UN member country could put this forward. 
Even a significant movement towards the convening of the General 
Assembly to consider an immediate, unconditional cease-fire will put 
significant pressure on the major powers to support an immediate 
cease-fire."

    President Bush said yesterday: "We will work toward a plan in the 
United Nations Security Council that addresses the root causes of the 
problem, so that whatever comes out of the Security Council will be able 
to last."
<p>Jimmy Carter wrote in a <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/07/31/AR2006073100923.html" target="_new">piece</a> published by the <i>Washington Post</i> this 
morning: "The Middle East is a tinderbox, with some key players on all 
sides waiting for every opportunity to destroy their enemies with 
bullets, bombs and missiles. ... There will be no substantive and 
permanent peace for any peoples in this troubled region as long as 
Israel is violating key UN resolutions, official American policy and the 
international 'road map' for peace by occupying Arab lands and 
oppressing the Palestinians." 
<p>Zunes is Middle East editor for Foreign Policy In Focus and author 
of the book "Tinderbox: U.S. Middle East Policy and the Roots of 
Terrorism." He recently wrote: "The Bush administration and Congress 
correctly call for the disarming of Lebanese militias, such as 
Hezbollah, according to UN Security Council resolution 1559, but they 
conspicuously fail to also demand resolution 1559's call for the 
withdrawal of foreign forces from Lebanon, such as Israel's. The United 
States never called for the full implementation of UN Security Council 
resolution 425 and nine subsequent resolutions calling for Israel's 
withdrawal from Lebanon during Israel's 22-year occupation of the 
southern part of that country. Nor has the House ever called for the 
full implementation of UN Security Council resolutions 446, 451, 465 and 
472 calling on Israel to withdraw its illegal settlements from the 
occupied West Bank and Golan Heights or dozens of other UN Security 
Council resolutions currently being violated by Israel, Morocco, Turkey, 
Pakistan or other U.S. allies." A list of some of the UN Security 
Council resolutions being violated by U.S. allies is available at:

     Professor of international law at the University of Illinois, Boyle 
suggests the establishment by the United Nations General Assembly of "an 
International Criminal Tribunal for Israel (ICTI) as a 'subsidiary 
organ' under UN Charter Article 22. The ICTI would be organized along 
the lines of the International Criminal Tribunal for Yugoslavia (ICTY), 
which was established by the Security Council. ... [T]he establishment 
of ICTY by the UN General Assembly would serve as a deterrent upon 
Israeli leaders such as Prime Minister Olmert, Defense Minister Peretz, 
Chief of Staff Halutz and Israel's other top generals because they will 
be prosecuted for their further infliction of international crimes upon 
the Lebanese and the Palestinians. Without such a deterrent, Israel 
might be emboldened to attack Syria. ... For the UN General Assembly to 
establish ICTI could stop the further development of this momentum 
towards a regional, if not global, catastrophe." Boyle is author of the 
books "Biowarfare and Terrorism" and "Destroying World Order."
