<p>WASHINGTON - April 26 - With oil giant  ExxonMobil poised to announce another quarter of record profits,  thousands of people are turning to the Exxpose Exxon campaign  each day to educate themselves about ExxonMobil's egregious  environmental record and ways to make a difference.</p>
<p>   "The American public is increasingly fed-up with ExxonMobil's  profits and arrogance," says Shawnee Hoover, Campaign Director  for Exxpose Exxon, a national coalition of the nation's leading  environmental and public interest organizations. "Consumers are  angry about high gas prices and high CEO pay-outs, but they get  even angrier when they learn about Exxon's agenda to keep us  addicted to oil and rob us of a sustainable future."</p>
<p>   The coalition reports that its website, ExxposeExxon.com, has  seen a 300 percent jump in visitors per week on average since  ExxonMobil announced record-breaking 2005 profits of $36.1  billion. </p>
<p>   Exxpose Exxon's call for a consumer boycott of Exxon and Mobil  gas stations have been echoed by several other groups in recent  weeks, including the passage of a resolution to boycott  ExxonMobil in Southern Texas. </p>
<p>   ExxonMobil is the only major oil company to spend $15 million  on funding global warming skeptics, lobby against national  reductions of global warming pollution, refuse meaningful  investment of its record profits in renewable energies, and  vocally oppose U.S. efforts to become energy independent.</p>
<p>   "We have the technologies to transition our economy off oil  and help bring down consumer energy costs," says Tim Greeff of  the Natural Resources Defense Council. "ExxonMobil should invest  in these renewable technologies or at least stop standing in the  way of progress toward energy independence."</p>
