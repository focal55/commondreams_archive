<p>SAN FRANCISCO, California - March 9 - The third episode of the Sierra Club's new television series tells the stories of people who have suffered alarming health effects caused by exposure to the high levels of toxic dioxin and other heavy metals released into the air and water by the DuPont plant in DeLisle, Mississippi.  We follow as they cope with their own terminal illnesses and those of their family members, and as they testify in a lawsuit against DuPont- some of them with only months to live.  "Dioxin, Duplicity & DuPont" will air Thursday, March 9 at 8:30 PM EST/PST on Link TV, and will be available for viewing and download at www.sierraclubtv.org.

<p>With unprecedented access to this Southern courtroom, we follow the lives of the people who have been directly affected by the pollution as they tell about living with DuPont for years.  Despite alarming illnesses and cancer clusters surrounding the plant, DuPont has maintained that it upholds a strong public safety record, and the government has done nothing to contradict this blatant lie.  Now, over 2,000 people who worked in or lived by the plant are bringing a massive lawsuit against the company.

<p>"Sometimes when we talk about pollution, people don’t realize the devastating toll on workers and nearby residents who are exposed to these poisons. We have had far too many deaths here from 'rare cancers,'" said Myra Marsh, a former DuPont worker who lives one mile from the plant.  "A lady in our community who was only 62 died last weekend of liver cancer. She was not a drinker."

<p>During Hurricane Katrina, DuPont’s levee failed and some of DuPont’s open waste pits were inundated by the storm surge. Waste escaped from DuPont into surrounding neighborhoods and the Bay of St. Louis. But DuPont has consistently denied any toxic releases.

<p>"Sierra Club Chronicles" is a monthly series by award-winning filmmaker Robert Greenwald ("Outfoxed," "Wal-Mart: The High Cost of Low Price"). Produced by Greenwald’s Brave New Films in association with Sierra Club Productions, and hosted by Daryl Hannah, the series captures seven David vs. Goliath stories: the dramatic efforts of committed individuals across the country working to protect the health of their environment and communities.

<p>The next episode, airing April 13, focuses on the ranchers who are suffering due to increased drilling and irresponsible drilling practices on the public land where their cattle graze. The Bureau of Land Management has been leasing more and more of this land to oil and natural gas companies- and the chemical waste spilled by these companies is killing cattle. Now, a coalition of ranchers including Republicans and Bush supporters are fighting back.  Summaries of all seven episodes and tips for planning a house party are available at www.sierraclubtv.org.

<p>One new episode will premiere the second Thursday of each month at 8:30 PM Eastern and Pacific through July 2006. Link TV is on DIRECTV channel 375 and Dish Network channel 9410.  Emmy Award winner Molly O'Brien co-executive produces and Richard Ray Pérez serves as director and supervising producer.  Kim Haddow and Adrienne Bramhall oversee the production for Sierra Club.

<p>"Sierra Club Chronicles" is made possible by the generous support of the Ford Foundation.
