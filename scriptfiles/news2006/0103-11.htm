<p>WASHINGTON - January 3 - Today, former Republican lobbyist Jack Abramoff pleaded guilty to three criminal charges: conspiracy, mail fraud and tax evasion. The information filed by prosecutors states that Abramoff and his former associate Michael Scanlon conspired to steal millions of dollars from Indian tribes the men represented and from the law firms where Abramoff worked.<br />
<br />
Although it fails to list them by name, the information states that Abramoff defrauded the Mississippi Choctaw tribe, the Louisiana Coushatta tribe, the Michigan Saginaw Chippewa tribe, and the Texas Tigua tribe, as well as SPI Spirits and Foxcomm Communications.<br />

<br />
The information also refers to three unnamed co-conspirators: Representative #1 and Staffers A and B. Representative #1 refers to Rep. Bob Ney (R-OH), Staffer A is likely Tony Rudy, former Deputy Chief of Staff to Rep. Tom DeLay (R-TX) and Staffer B is Neil Volz, former Chief of Staff to Bob Ney.<br />
<br />
CREW’s executive director Melanie Sloan stated, “Mr. Abramoff’s plea is just the beginning. Soon we will see numerous Members of Congress and former Congressional staff indicted. After Rep. Ney, Rep. DeLay had the strongest ties to Mr. Abramoff. Mr. Abramoff wined and dined Rep. DeLay, provided him with skyboxes, and paid for him to take expensive luxury trips. In return, Rep. DeLay provided legislative assistance to numerous Abramoff clients including Indian tribes and the Marianas Islands.” Sloan continued, “the sheer number of Members of Congress likely to be implicated before this is over suggests that this will be the largest Congressional scandal in history.” <br />
<br />
Sloan continued, “the fact that the House ethics committee is still sitting on its hands, while indictment after indictment is announced by the Department of Justice, is more than just galling, it is a betrayal of the American public by Congress. It is incumbent by Members of Congress to police themselves, and they are simply not doing their job.”
