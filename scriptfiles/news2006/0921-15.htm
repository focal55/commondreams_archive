<p>WASHINGTON - September 21 - <p>   -- Speech at National Constitution Center, Monday at noon EST.</p>
<p>   -- Sen. Russ Feingold to &quot;Present Vision for Restoring Democracy.&quot;</p>
<p>   -- Address Will Build MoveOn's GOTV Effort by Energizing Members.</p>
<p>   -- Progressive Vision Series Promotes a Positive National Agenda.</p>
<p>   Senator Russell Feingold will outline critical steps needed to  defend our Democracy, including making all elections secure  against vote suppression and tampering, ending the influence of  big money on politics, preserving checks and balances in  government and defending the constitutional rights of American  citizens.</p>
<p>   The speech, sponsored by MoveOn.org Political Action, is the  third and final in a series of events aimed at promoting a  positive national agenda and at mobilizing the organization's  volunteers and voters in the upcoming congressional elections.  The previous speakers were Congressman Sherrod Brown of Ohio and  Senator Barack Obama of Illinois. Brown focused on the need to  ensure that all Americans have guaranteed access to high quality,  affordable health care and to help us achieve energy  independence, Obama outlined a plan to shift away from fossil  fuel and towards clean renewable energy sources.</p>
<p>   This summer, over 100,000 MoveOn members came together in  house parties and online to choose the top three positive goals  for the country that MoveOn will fight for in the months to come  --  health care for all, clean energy and a democracy restored.</p>
<p>   &quot;MoveOn members care passionately about restoring democracy,&quot;  said Ben Brandzel, advocacy director for MoveOn.org Political  Action. &quot;Senator Feingold's leadership will motivate members to  work hard so we can win big in November and achieve these  critical goals,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>   &quot;We now have an election system badly in need of repair, and a  President who thinks he is above the law. As a consequence, we've  seen the checks and balances built into our constitution weakened  and many of our citizens' rights eroded. This fall we have an  opportunity to say enough is enough and begin restoring our  democracy,&quot; said Feingold.</p>
<p>   At the Obama and Feingold events and online, members are  encouraged to sign up for Call for Change, a volunteer phone bank  designed to increase Democratic turnout for the mid-term  elections.  The program allows MoveOn's tens of thousands of  volunteers to instantly mobilize and make GOTV calls to  Democratic voters in the most competitive races.</p>

<p>   WHAT: Speech: &quot;Reclaiming our Democracy&quot;</p>
<p>   WHERE: National Constitution Center, Kirby Auditorium, 2nd  floor in the Annenberg Center, 525 Arch St., Independence Mall,  Philadelphia, Pa.</p>
