<p>WASHINGTON - July 6 - Last week, a class action lawsuit was filed in Federal District Court in Chicago challenging a new law requiring Medicaid beneficiaries to document their U.S. citizenship with passports, birth certificates, and other documentation. The law went into effect on July 1. 

<p>Ironically, this law is likely to cause millions of U.S. citizens to lose Medicaid coverage and become uninsured, especially those who are least capable of producing the necessary documentation (i.e. seniors in nursing homes, foster children, people with mental or physical disabilities, the homeless, and people who lost possessions in natural disasters such as hurricane Katrina).

<p>On Friday morning, July 7, the Court will hear plaintiffs’ motion for a temporary restraining order (t.r.o.) seeking to stop the implementation of the new law. It is expected that a decision about the t.r.o. motion will be made that day or shortly thereafter.

<p>Families USA, which is supporting plaintiffs’ attorneys in the litigation and is coordinating efforts to repeal the new law, will send an alert to the media about what transpired in the Federal District Court as soon as the hearing concludes.
