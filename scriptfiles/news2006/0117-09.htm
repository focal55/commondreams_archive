<p>WASHINGTON - January 17 - New York, NY, Jan. 17, 2006 – On January 17, 2006, Amnesty International will host the third panel in a year-long series in New York City to bring greater attention to war crimes against women.  From 6:30 to 9:30pm at New York University Law School, panelists Gabor Rona, John Prendergast, Ruth Messinger, Kristen Geary, Sasha Chanoff, and Sheila Dauer will address the ongoing brutalization and murder of women in Darfur, Sudan, and the legal and practical challenges in bringing criminals to justice and treating survivors.  Darfur is a devastating example of how state-sanctioned violence against women has emptied the land of habitants, creating an ethnic apartheid and a state of impunity.

<p>WHEN: Tuesday, January 17, 2006<br>

      6:30-7:15 reception, 7:15-9:30 panel<br>

      Admission free.  RSVP (optional) at AmnestyRSVP@yahoo.com

<p>WHERE: New York University Law School*<br>

       Greenberg Lounge, Vanderbilt Hall<br>

       40 Washington Square South<br>

       *ID required for entry into law school

** Ruth Messinger, President of American Jewish World Service and former Manhattan Borough President.<br>

** John Prendergast, Senior Advisor for International Crisis Group, and former Special Advisor to the US State Department and Director of African Affairs on the National Security Council.<br>

<p>The Confronting War Crimes against Women series is one part of Amnesty’s campaign to raise public awareness about rape and other violence against women as weapons of war, and to mount action to bring to justice perpetrators of war crimes against women.  

<p>“Our government has called the killings in Darfur a genocide, and whether one agrees or calls it ethnic cleansing, the rape of women is integral to the destruction of life and community ongoing there.  Just as in Bosnia and Rwanda, government-sponsored combatants are targeting women to eliminate specific groups of people,” said Denise Bell, an Amnesty activist working on the issue.  

<p>“Our government and others will not act to stop the killings until there is a political cost to inaction.  Citizen pressure is the remaining course of action.  History shows that such atrocities will continue until there is sufficient public outrage to compel leaders to act," Bell added.  "Amnesty is acting to press governments to hold perpetrators accountable, and the series is one way of galvanizing public pressure so the killings and rapes in Darfur are stopped and the perpetrators are brought to justice.”
