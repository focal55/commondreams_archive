<p>WASHINGTON - January 12 - The Alliance New Mexico, patients and other advocates urged Governor Bill Richardson in meetings Wednesday to consider medical marijuana in the upcoming legislative session. The Alliance New Mexico is also holding a letter-writing campaign so New Mexicans can remind the governor how important this issue is to the state.

<p>With the recent victory for medical marijuana legislation in Rhode Island, momentum for reform at the state level is building. But because this is an even-numbered year, Governor Richardson represents the only opportunity for the issue to be considered this year. In the month-long 2006 session, which starts January 17, only budget matters and bills the governor puts on his "call" will be addressed by the legislature.

<p>Last year, intense advocacy work brought the legislation very close to passing, but it was stopped just short of a full House vote by a political conflict unrelated to the legislation itself. "Coming so close in 2005 and being stopped at the very end of the process was heartbreaking," said Alliance New Mexico director Reena Szczepanski. "So why are we trying this again?  Because we are dedicated to protecting the rights of the seriously ill and dying in our state who should have access to this medicine.  Because we are more confident than ever that we have the legislative support to pass this bill."

<p>The governor has not yet decided whether to put the medical marijuana bill on his call, but the recent meetings and letter-writing campaign have given him numerous reasons to do so. The governor must decide within the next few days.
