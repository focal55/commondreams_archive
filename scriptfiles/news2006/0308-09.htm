<p>AMSTERDAM - March 8 - The first report into the extent to 
which genetically engineered organisms have 'leaked' into the 
environment  - released today - reveals a disturbing picture of 
widespread contamination, illegal planting and negative agricultural 
side effects.

<p>The report is a summary of incidents uncovered by the on-line 
Contamination Register (1) set up by Greenpeace and GeneWatch UK. It 
reveals a catalogue of highly disturbing incidents right across the 
world, including:

<p>- Pork meat from genetically engineered pigs being sold to consumers<br>

- Ordinary crops being contaminated with GE crops containing 
pharmaceuticals<br>

- Growing and international distribution of illegal antibiotic resistant 
Maize seeds<br>

- Planting of outlawed GE crops which have been smuggled into countries<br>

- Mixing of unapproved GE crops in food, including shipments of food aid<br>

- Inadvertent mixing of different GE strains even in high profile 
scientific field trials

<p>The report reveals 113 such cases worldwide, involving 39 countries - 
twice as many countries as are officially allowed to grow GM crops since 
they were first commercialised in 1996. Worryingly, the frequency of 
these cases is increasing, with 11 countries affected in 2005 alone. 
Contamination has even been found in countries conducting supposedly 
''carefully controlled" high-profile farm-scale evaluations, such as the UK. "This may well only be the tip of the iceberg, as there is no official 
global or national contamination register so far," said Dr. Sue Mayer of 
GeneWatch UK, who leads the team of investigators. "Most incidents of 
contamination are actually kept as confidential business information by 
companies as well as public authorities."

<p>Greenpeace is calling for a mandatory international register of all such 
events to be set up, along with the adoption of minimum standards of 
identification and labelling of all international shipments of GE 
crops.  "Without such biosafety standards ,the global community will 
have no chance of tracing and recalling dangerous GMOs, should this 
become necessary." said Benedikt Haerlin of Greenpeace International's 
Biosafety Protocol delegation.

<p>The publication of the report comes only days before the latest meeting 
of the 132 countries who have signed the Biosafety Protocol (2), which 
is to establish standards of safety and information of GE crops in 
global food and feed trade. At their last meeting an imminent agreement 
was blocked by only two member states, Brazil and New Zealand. They were 
backed by the major GE exporting countries USA, Argentina and Canada, 
who are not members of the Protocol and want to restrict required 
identification to a meaningless note that a shipment "may contain" GE.

<p>"All of these countries have national legislation to protect themselves 
from illegal GE imports. Still they want to deny the same rights and 
level of information to less developed countries, with no national 
Biosafety-laws and means to enforce them," concluded Haerlin. "Do they 
really want such unethical double standards and create dumping grounds 
for unidentified and illegal GE imports? We hope that Brazil, who will 
be hosting this meeting, will not betray the developing countries and 
cater to large agro-businesses at the expense of the environment." Greenpeace is an independent campaigning organisation that uses 
non-violent creative confrontation to expose global environmental 
problems to force solutions that are essential to a green and peaceful 
future.
