<p>WASHINGTON - August 24 -  Green candidates across the U.S. have made health care for all a top campaign issue, demanding single-payer national health insurance, and accusing Democrats and Republicans alike of sweeping the health care crisis under the rug while accepting major insurance company contributions.</p>
          <p class="navigate">"Greens are calling health care a national emergency, while many Democratic and Republican candidates are talking about it as little as possible," said Bob Levis, Wisconsin Green candidate for the U.S. House (5th District) &lt;<a href="http://www.boblevis.org">http://www.boblevis.org</a>&gt;.&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="navigate">Mr. Levis is running against incumbent F. James Sensenbrenner, who owns over three million in pharmaceutical stock and
          has voted against reforms such as the patients' bill of rights.  "More than 45 million Americans, including 9 million children,
          have no health coverage.  Millions of other Americans have inadequate coverage.  The U.S. leads in medical technology, but
          the worst access to health care among industrial nations."</p>
          <p class="navigate">"The only solution to the crisis is single-payer national health insurance, which will cover every American, regardless of age, income, residence, or prior medical condition, with quality coverage," added Mr. Levis.  "Single-payer national health insurance will cost working Americans far less than they now pay for private coverage.  Single-payer also takes the burden off businesses to provide health coverage for employees, and creates a lot less paperwork and aggravation for hospitals, physicians, and other health professionals."</p>
          <p class="navigate">"Many people believe that 'government inefficiency' would make national health insurance more expensive than private insurance, when the facts indicate the opposite," said Art Myatt, Michigan Green candidate for the U.S. House (12th District).  "Medicare delivers 98 cents to health care providers out of every dollar of Medicare income.  The private insurance industry does well to deliver 70 cents.  National health insurance would actually lower the total amount that society spends on health care."</p>
          <p class="navigate">Greens note that the Democratic Party removed national health insurance from its national platform during the Clinton-Gore Administration.  President Clinton introduced a complex 'managed care' plan, which would have placed coverage under the control of a few giant insurance firms.  Even though the Clinton plan failed, most Democrats continue to favor reforms that leave powerful HMO and insurance corporations in control of health care.  None of these plans will solve the health care crisis, say Greens, because HMO and insurance corporations are the root of the problem -- they don't want to cover Americans who are old or poor or have prior medical conditions that may interfere with profits.</p>
          <p class="navigate">"While Greens accept no corporate contributions, Democratic and Republican politicians receive millions from corporate health lobbies that don't want single-payer national health insurance," said Carol Brouillet, Green congressional candidate in California's 14th District &lt;<a href="http://www.carolforcongress.org">http://www.carolforcongress.org</a>&gt;.</p>
          <p class="navigate">"Sen. Hillary Clinton (D-NY) is the top 2006 recipient in Congress of contributions from the insurance industry, according to the Center for Responsive Politics &lt;<a href="http://www.opensecrets.org">http://www.opensecrets.org</a>&gt;.
          Both Democrats and Republicans are listed among the top recipients of money from the insurance and pharmaceutical industry."  (Green candidate Howie Hawkins is challenging Sen. Clinton for her Senate seat &lt;<a href="http://www.hawkinsforsenate.org">http://www.hawkinsforsenate.org</a>&gt;.)</p>
          <p class="navigate">One exception among Democrats is Rep. John Conyers (Mich.), who each year introduces legislation for single-payer national health insurance in the U.S. House.  The Green Party has consistently supported the Conyers bills.</p>
          <p class="navigate">Corporate pharmaceutical lobbies also made sure that Congress passed its prescription drug 'reform' bill in 2003 -- which benefited drug companies but did little to help older Americans who need their prescription medicines.  Under single-payer, all seniors will have full access to their prescription medicines at zero or minimal cost.</p>
          <p class="navigate">Some states, such as California, have been considering state-wide single-payer plans.  Greens in these states have supported such proposals.  The chief obstacles have been Democratic and Republican politicians who, under the influence of corporate lobbies, work to obstruct single-payer, and advertising by HMOs and insurance companies that misleads the public.</p>
          <p class="navigate">In Tennessee, Green gubernatorial candidate Howard Switzer &lt;http://www.h4gov.com> is challenging incumbent Phil Bredesen (D), who has been dismantling one of the nation's few state provided health care systems, dropping 330,000 (many of them in need of care) from TennCare's rolls during the past year.  Mr. Switzer's campaign slogan is "Healthcare for All."</p>
          <p class="navigate">"Americans will win universal coverage and quality health care under a single-payer plan when voters elect candidates who are on the side of Americans who need health care, not on the side of corporate lobbies," said Jeff Kravitz, Green candidate for the U.S. House in California's 5th District &lt;<a href="http://www.kravitzforcongress.org">http://www.kravitzforcongress.org</a>&gt;.
"The health care crisis and the demand for single-payer national health insurance are at the top of the list of reasons why America needs the Green Party."</p>
