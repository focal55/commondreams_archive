<p>WASHINGTON - November 21 - Mexican authorities 
                  released a groundbreaking report over the weekend on the government's 
                  use of violent repression to crush its opponents during the 
                  1960s-80s. <a href="#informe">The full report has now been posted 
here</a> on the Web site of the National Security Archive.
<p>The report by the Office of Special Prosecutor Ignacio Carrillo 
                  Prieto, named by President Vicente Fox in 2002 to investigate 
                  past human rights crimes, accuses three Mexican presidents of 
                  a sustained policy of violence targeting armed guerrillas and 
                  student protesters alike, including the use of &quot;massacres, 
                  forced disappearance, systematic torture, and genocide.&quot; 
                  The report makes clear that the abuses were not the work of 
                  individual military units or renegade officers, but official 
                  practice under Presidents D&iacute;az Ordaz (1964-1970), Echeverr&iacute;a 
                  (1970-1976) and L&oacute;pez Portillo (1976-1982).</p>
                <p>The document's release marks the first time the Mexican government 
                  has accepted responsibility for waging a secret and illicit 
                  war against its perceived enemies. Unlike prior investigations 
                  into the Mexican &quot;dirty war,&quot; the Special Prosecutor's 
                  report draws on thousands of secret records from the vaults 
                  of Mexican military, intelligence and police agencies. It traces 
                  for the first time the flow of orders from the President, the 
                  Defense Secretary and the Interior Ministry down to the soldiers 
                  and security agents in the field, and the returning flow of 
                  reports back to Mexico City. The official sources are complemented 
                  by testimonies and eyewitness accounts gathered by the investigators.</p>
                <p>Last February, the National Security Archive posted an earlier 
                  draft of the report, when it became clear that the Fox government 
                  was hesitating to publish the official document. Today's version 
                  was released late on Friday night, November 17, at the start 
                  of a long weekend in Mexico, and posted on the Web site of the 
                  <a href="http://www.pgr.gob.mx/" target="_blank">Mexican Attorney 
                  General's office</a>. It is over 800 pages long, and contains 
                  photographs, declassified government records, and lengthy indexes 
                  to organizations and names.</p>
<p>The report includes chapters on the 1968 and 1971 student massacres 
                  in Mexico City, the counterinsurgency waged against armed guerrillas 
                  in Guerrero during the 1970s, and the broader attack on dissidence 
                  throughout the country over the almost two decades covered by 
                  the investigation. The report describes and names the victims 
                  in 645 disappearances, 99 extrajudicial executions, and more 
                  than two thousand cases of torture, among other human rights 
violations documented.</p>
<p>&quot;The release of the Special Prosecutor's report is a direct 
                  result of the demand of Mexican citizens to know what happened 
                  during the dirty war,&quot; Kate Doyle, Director of the Archive's 
                  Mexico Project, said today, &quot;and is unique in the annals 
                  of Latin American truth commissions for the access investigators 
                  had to government records. In the past, not only did the authoritarian 
                  regime violently attack its opponents, it sought to cover up 
                  its role through lies, terror and intimidation for years afterwards. 
                  But while the report takes an important step toward reversing 
                  Mexico's legacy of impunity, the Fox administration failed in 
                  its attempts to prosecute those responsible for the crimes described 
                  in it. That job is left to the new government of Felipe Calder&oacute;n, 
                who takes office on December 1.&quot;</p>
