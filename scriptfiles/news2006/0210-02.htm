<p>AMSTERDAM - February 10 - Greenpeace International has won two 
prizes at the prestigious World Press Photo awards for images depicting 
the drought in the Amazon last year and the lingering effects of the 
Chernobyl nuclear disaster.

<p>The awards come on the day that scientists revealed the climate is at 
its warmest in the Northern hemisphere for more than 1,200 years (1) and 
just two months before the 20th anniversary of the Chernobyl explosion. 
The photographs are a timely reminder of the failure of governments and 
corporations to act in the past, and the job still to be done to stop 
dangerous climate change and the ugly reality of nuclear power.  

<p>"There are no prizes for those who made these photographs a reality," 
said International Executive Director Gerd Leipold. "The images are a 
graphic warning of the consequences of the global obsession with dirty 
energy at the expense of communities and the environment."  
 
<p>The photographs were taken by Greenpeace commissioned photographers 
Daniel Beltra and Robert Knoth.

<p>"The pictures are all the more powerful, not just because of their 
quality, but also because of the message they send. They are a view of 
the present, but also a glimpse of what the future might look like 
unless action is taken now," said Greenpeace International photo editor 
John Novis.
 
<p>NOTES:<br>

(1)The Spatial Extent of 20th-Century Warmth in the Context of the Past 
1200 Years -Timothy J. Osborn and Keith R. Briffa; Science 10 February 2006

<p>Greenpeace demands Governments and corporations invest in renewable 
energy and energy efficiency and massively reduce their greenhouse gas 
emissions, to combat dangerous climate change. 

<p>April 26th is the 20th anniversary of the world's worst nuclear 
accident, at Chernobyl.
An exhibition of Robert's portraits of nuclear devastation in the former 
Soviet Union will be launched internationally in April.
