<p>WASHINGTON - May 16 - Halliburton Watch  launched a new &quot;Give It Up, Cheney&quot; campaign today, calling on  the Vice President to relinquish his remaining stock holdings in  Halliburton.
<p>   Cheney, who was Halliburton's CEO from 1995 to 2000, continues  to hold 50,000 stock option shares worth a gross value of $3.76  million as of May 15, 2006.</p>
<p>   Cheney's 2005 public financial disclosure report was filed  with the Office of Government Ethics on Monday, just three days  before Halliburton's annual shareholder meeting. The Vice  President reported that he also has thousands of stock options in  Lockheed-Martin, Electronic Data Systems and Proctor and Gamble.  In addition, Cheney received numerous personal gifts in 2005,  including three guns and a hunting decoy.</p>
<p>   The relevant pages from his financial disclosure report are  posted at: <a href="http://releases.usnewswire.com/redir.asp?ReleaseID=65852&Link=http://www.giveitupcheney.org/disclosure.html">http://www.giveitupcheney.org/disclosure.html</a>.</p>
<p>   &quot;The stock options create the appearance of an ongoing  conflict of interest at the highest levels of government,&quot; said  Charlie Cray, co-director of HalliburtonWatch.org. &quot;We call on  the Vice President to give up his remaining Halliburton options  immediately and eliminate the appearance of a conflict of  interest they continue to represent between his governmental  duties and his interest as a stockholder in the nation's number  one Iraq war contractor.&quot;</p>
<p>   Cheney has signed a gift agreement, which stipulates that the  proceeds of his Halliburton options will go to charity. To see  the agreement, go here: </p>

<p>   The &quot;Give It Up, Cheney&quot; campaign suggests Cheney consider  donating the proceeds from his remaining Halliburton stock  options to the following charities that work with Iraq war  veterans:</p>
