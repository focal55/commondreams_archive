<p>WASHINGTON - August 15 - Following the UN-brokered ceasefire, the ICRC's key priority remains to reach the civilian population in villages and to ensure that all wounded are evacuated and all bodies are recovered, especially from collapsed buildings that were inaccessible during the fighting, a task that will be carried out primarily by the Lebanese Red Cross. The ICRC will concentrate on delivering water, food and drugs (especially for the wounded and the chronically ill) to civilians who have suffered – and continue to suffer – the direct consequences of the recent hostilities.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Evacuation of vulnerable civilians and recovery of bodies</B><BR>
On 11 August a joint ICRC-Lebanese Red Cross convoy evacuated 20 civilians to Tyre, including elderly people (one in a wheelchair) and families with children, from the village of Arzun, east of Tyre. One body was collected in a car between Srifa and Deir Qanun an Nahr in the same area. Between 12 July and 14 August, Lebanese Red Cross staff evacuated 886 wounded persons, transported 6,270 medical cases and collected 285 bodies.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Supplying food and helping to restore electricity</B><BR>
On 11 August, the ICRC supplied 15 tonnes of flour (300 bags of 50 kg each) to the only bakery still working in Tyre. The flour was brought in by truck from Sidon along with another 35 tonnes of flour for further distributions. On 14 August, 18,000 people in the Palestinian camp of Rashidieh were provided with flour for bread-making and 150 displaced persons sheltering in Tibnin hospital received family food parcels to last a week. The same day, the ICRC worked with local specialists to restore electricity to Tyre by repairing the city's power station, which had been hit by a missile.<BR>
<BR>
<B>ICRC ship reaches Tyre</B><BR>
On 12 August, an ICRC-chartered ship finally reached the port of Tyre after failing for two days to get the green light to proceed from Cyprus. It carried on board 100 tonnes of flour, 50 tonnes of fuel, 200,000 ready-to-eat meals, baby food and hygiene items.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Magen David Adom action in northern Israel</B><BR>
The Magen David Adom (MDA) has been providing medical services for civilians affected by the hostilities in northern Israel since 12 July. MDA personnel have treated and evacuated hundreds of persons, including 214 severely and moderately injured individuals, and collected the bodies of 43 civilians. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Cooperation with Syrian Arab Red Crescent </B><BR>
The ICRC continues to respond to specific requests, the latest being the provision of a forklift to enable the Syrian Arab Red Crescent to carry out its logistical operations. The ICRC has also strengthened the National Society's ability to restore family links by providing its branches with mobile telephones and prepaid calling cards along with computer hardware needed to register those who have fled to Syria. <BR>
