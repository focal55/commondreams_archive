<p>WASHINGTON - January 24 - Today’s announcement by Ford Motor Company is tragic for the employees who have invested their lives in Ford and devastating for all working people.  For decades, autoworkers have defined what it means to have a middle class job in America.  The evisceration of good, middle class jobs is the single biggest crisis facing our nation today.  That’s why we are organizing as never before to demand the attention and action it will take to restore respect for work and workers in this country.  

 

<p>Thank goodness the Ford employees have a strong union to give them a voice and a place at the table to ensure their needs are addressed in this difficult situation.    

  

<p>Workers cannot and should not be expected to bear the burden of the competitive pressures on the auto industry.  Instead of trying to shrink its way to profitability, Ford should innovate – developing new products and technologies to regain market dominance.  

 

<p>Our elected officials also have a role to play.  Now is the time to enact a national health plan that will provide the affordable, quality health care working families need, while helping companies compete in the global marketplace.
