<p>WASHINGTON - December 12 - "Today’s announcement that the EPA will continue with plans to close its library system, despite public and Congressional concerns, could put Americans' ability to protect their health and safety at risk."</P>

<P>"There is great concern among members of Congress, public employees and private citizens about the EPA’s "recycling" of library materials. There have been allegations from Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility (PEER) that important documents have simply been thrown away, without being added to the new digital system and others have been packed up never to be seen again."</P>

<P>"It’s imperative that as we switch from the traditional library system to the digitized system the EPA wants to implement, we make every possible effort to ensure no information is lost in the transition and that all information will remain open and accessible to the public."</P>

<P>"Until a Congressional investigation is completed into the process of the library closures and subsequent "recycling" policies, the EPA should stop discarding any materials. Before EPA moves forward the public needs to know all of the facts so that they can be sure the EPA is acting in the public’s best interest."</P>
