<p>WASHINGTON - May 3 - Two key U.S. Senators recently criticized the Bush 
			Administration's &quot;premature&quot; use of a waiver to allow weapons 
			exports to Indonesia. Senators Russ Feingold (D-WI) and Patrick 
			Leahy (D-VT) expressed concern &quot;that this waiver, unattached to any 
			clear strategy or specific benchmarks, sends the wrong message to 
			the Indonesian Government and to other countries.&quot; <br>
			<br>
			In a <a href="#letter">letter to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice 
			and Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld</a>, the Senators wrote 
			that &quot;The Administration needs to make clear to the Indonesian 
			Government that the United States will continue to insist that it 
			bring to justice those who have committed crimes against humanity, 
			and reform its military to become professional, transparent, and 
			grounded in the rule of law.&quot; <br>
			<br>
			They urged Rice and Rumsfeld to report to Congress on Indonesia's 
			progress on military reform and in prosecuting those responsible for 
			human rights violations in East Timor and elsewhere. <br>
			<br>
			The Senators requested a comprehensive strategy which links military 
			assistance to accountability and military reform. &quot;This strategy 
			should contain clear consequences should the Indonesian Government 
			not make significant progress.&quot;<br>
			<br>
			&quot;The Bush Administration's imprudent rush to expand assistance to 
			the Indonesian military is alarming and short-sighted,&quot; said Karen 
			Orenstein, National Coordinator of the East Timor and Indonesia <i>
			Action </i>Network. &quot;We urge other members of Congress to work with 
			Senators Feingold and Leahy to establish a forward-looking policy 
			which promotes genuine accountability for human rights crimes and 
			real reform of Indonesia's corrupt military.&quot; <br>
			<br>
			Senator Leahy, ranking member of the Foreign Operations 
			Appropriations Subcommittee, authored
			<a href="http://www.etan.org/news/2005/11conf.htm">the restrictions 
			on certain forms of military assistance</a>, which the
			<a href="http://www.etan.org/news/2005/11waiver.htm">administration 
			waived last November</a> only two days after President Bush signed 
			them into law. Senator Feingold, a member of the Foreign Relations 
			and Intelligence Committees,
			<a href="http://www.etan.org/et2006/march/31/28feingld.htm">recently 
			visited Indonesia</a>. Both Senators have been consistent voices 
			supporting human rights and reform in Indonesia. <br>
			<br>
A copy of the letter is below.&nbsp; </p>
			<p>ETAN advocates for democracy, justice and human rights for East 
			Timor and Indonesia. ETAN calls for an international tribunal to 
			prosecute crimes against humanity committed in East Timor from 1975 
			to 1999 and for restrictions on U.S. military assistance to 
			Indonesia until there is genuine reform of its security forces. For 
			additional background, see <a href="http://www.etan.org">

			<p>The Honorable Donald Rumsfeld <br>

			U.S. Department of Defense <br>
			1000 Defense Pentagon <br>
			Washington, DC 20301 </p>
			<p>Dear Secretary Rice and Secretary Rumsfeld: </p>
			<p>We are writing to express our disappointment and concern with 
			your decision to use the waiver authority contained in section 
			599F(b) of the fiscal year 2006 Foreign Operations, Export 
			Financing, and Related Programs Appropriations Act (P.L. 109-102).
			</p>
			<p>We recognize that as the world's largest Muslim country Indonesia 
			is a critical partner in combating terrorism, and that it is in our 
			strategic interest to try to work with Indonesia on a range of 
			issues. However, we believe it is critical that Indonesia bring to 
			justice those who have committed crimes against humanity and other 
			violations of human rights, and make further progress in reforming 
			its military. </p>
			<p>When your staff briefed our offices on your decision to exercise 
			the waiver, we were told that you share our goals but believe that 
			you can achieve them by different means. However, we are concerned 
			that this waiver, unattached to any clear strategy or specific 
			benchmarks, sends the wrong message to the Indonesian Government and 
			to other countries. We ask that you take specific actions to ensure 
			that any Foreign Military Financing (FMF) assistance or exports of 
			defense articles are provided to the Indonesian Government only 
			within a framework that states clearly what the U.S. government 
			expects of the Indonesians, as well as what the consequences would 
			be of the Indonesian Government's failure to effectively address the 
			issues contained in section 599F(a) of P.L. 109-102. While it is our 
			belief that your exercise of this waiver was premature, it is 
			essential that assistance be provided only under controlled and 
			accountable circumstances. Accordingly, we urge you to: </p>
			<ul>
				<li>Provide a report to the Congress on the status of 
				Indonesia's progress in the areas outlined in section 599F(a), 
				and the actions that the Departments of State and Defense are 
				taking to encourage the Indonesian Government to make such 
				progress. </li>
				<li>Develop a comprehensive strategy that includes specific 
				benchmarks that the United States will use to measure progress 
				in the three areas outlined in section 599F(a), and which 
				explains how military assistance is linked to accountability and 
				military reform. This strategy should contain clear consequences 
				should the Indonesian Government not make significant progress. 
				It should also specify how the Departments of State and Defense 
				will respond to future human rights violations by the Indonesian 
				military, and what action will be taken should no significant 
				progress be made on accountability and military reform. </li>
				<li>Provide a report describing specific actions --excluding FMF, 
				IMET or defense exports - that the Department of State is making 
				to encourage the Indonesian Government to address past crimes 
				against humanity and other human rights violations, and to make 
				further progress in reforming its military. </li>
			</ul>
			<p>We commend the progress that Indonesia has made since the end of 
			the Suharto regime. The military's role in politics has diminished 
			significantly, and the peace agreement in Aceh is very encouraging. 
			But the country has yet to come to terms with its past and has not 
			yet fully adopted the principles and values that form the foundation 
			of legitimate democracies. The Administration needs to make clear to 
			the Indonesian Government that the United States will continue to 
			insist that it bring to justice those who have committed crimes 
			against humanity, and reform its military to become professional, 
			transparent, and grounded in the rule of law. We feel that this 
			message can only be delivered effectively if our government 
			establishes a clear strategy and specific benchmarks that are linked 
			to new assistance. </p>
			<p>Thank you for your consideration. </p>
			<p>Sincerely, </p>
			<p>Russell D. Feingold <br>
			United States Senator </p>
			<p>Patrick J. Leahy <br>
			United States Senator </p>
