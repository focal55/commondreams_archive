<p>SPRINGFIELD, Illinois - March 1 - A bill that  would ban military-style semiautomatic weapons in Illinois, HB  2414, awaits action in the Illinois Legislature. Law enforcement  leaders, crime victims, and the Governor are calling for its  passage.  Today, the gun lobby said it would be economically  costly. </p>
<p>   &quot;The gun lobby's leaders said today in Springfield that  banning assault weapons would injure Illinois economically to the  tune of $150 million and cost the state 750 jobs,&quot; said Jennifer  Bishop, Illinois State director of the Brady Campaign to Prevent  Gun Violence.  &quot;Are Illinois residents really buying $150 million  a year worth of assault weapons?  If so, I urge the Legislature  to move as quickly as possible on this proposal, because we have  a bigger problem than we realized.&quot; </p>
<p>   &quot;If these guys are going to say that this assault weapons ban  will cause a loss of a few hundred jobs, how can you compare that  to the more than a thousand lives that are lost in our state each  year to gun violence, and many more nationally?,&quot; asked  Northwestern University Political Science Professor Steve Young,  the father of a gun violence victim.  &quot;The gun industry is the  most secretive of all industries. If they are claiming hundreds  of millions of dollars in lost profits, and many jobs lost, then  let them open their books and prove this.&quot; </p>
