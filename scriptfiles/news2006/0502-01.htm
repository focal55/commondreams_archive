<p>WASHINGTON - May 2 - Today, WakeUpWalMart.com,  America's campaign to change Wal-Mart, released the first  national study on Wal-Mart and crime.  The study, entitled "Is  Wal-Mart Safe?" analyzed the official 2004 police incident  reports (i.e. calls for police service) at 551 Wal-Mart store  locations.  Among the key findings of the study, include: </p>
<p>   -- In 2004, police received 148,331 calls for service for the  551 Wal-Mart stores analyzed, averaging 269 reported police  incidents per store. </p>
<p>   -- For just the 551 stores sampled, there were 2,909 reported  police calls for "violent or serious crimes," including 4  homicides, 9 rapes or attempts, 23 kidnappings or attempts, 154  sex crimes, 550 robberies or attempts and 1,024 auto thefts. </p>
<p>   -- Based on the number of reported police incidents for the  sample, it is estimated police responded to nearly 1 million  police incidents at Wal-Mart in 2004 costing taxpayers $77  million annually. </p>
<p>   -- Wal-Mart stores have a significantly higher number of  reported police incidents than nearby Target stores.  For the  sample, the average rate of reported police incidents at Wal-Mart  stores was 400 percent higher than the average rate of incidents  at nearby Target stores. </p>
<p>   The full study "Is Wal-Mart Safe?" and the official police  incident reports are available for download and review at  www.WalMartCrimeReport.com. </p>
<p>   "The high number of reported police incidents at Wal-Mart  stores is shocking and outrageous.  Wal-Mart's customers and the  community have a right to know whether or not their Wal-Mart is  safe.  Wal-Mart should immediately fund an independent study to  explore the issue of crime at Wal-Mart stores nationwide and  immediately take the necessary steps, including putting in roving  security patrols and staffing security cameras, to ensure the  safety of its customers at every Wal-Mart store," said Paul  Blank, campaign director for WakeUpWalMart.com. </p>
<p>   WakeUpWalMart.com released its study, "Is Wal-Mart Safe?" as  part of a nationwide initiative called "Help Make Wal-Mart Safe  by Mother's Day."  As part of the initiative, WakeUpWalMart.com  and 57 community groups released a joint letter calling on Wal- Mart's management to immediately address the public safety issues  and concerns of its consumers -- 70 percent of whom are women  shoppers -- by taking all of the necessary steps to improve  security at all of its stores by Mother's Day. </p>
<p>   "Public safety and crime are serious issues.  Despite internal  warnings about crime at some of Wal-Mart's stores, it is clear  Wal-Mart still has a high number of reported police incidents at  too many stores.  As our nation's largest retailer, Americans  deserve to know the truth about whether or not Wal-Mart is safe,"  added Blank. </p>
<p>   As a service to the general public, WakeUpWalMart.com also  launched a new website, WalMartCrimeReport.com.   WalMartCrimeReport.com will collect and disseminate Wal-Mart  crime data to the general public.  The website allows customers  and the general public to download copies of the official police  incident reports sent to us by local police departments.  The  WalMartCrimeReport.com website will also provide a variety of  documents that chronicle statements by Wal-Mart officials on  public safety, including internal Wal-Mart memos on public safety  issues. </p>
<p>   WakeUpWalMart.com is a national movement of 225,000 Americans  in all 50 states who have joined together to change Wal-Mart into  a responsible and moral corporation. </p>
