<p>WASHINGTON - November 1 - U.S. Senator Russ Feingold has sent a letter 
          to Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Chairman Kevin Martin to 
          inquire about the status of the agency&#8217;s investigation into possible 
          violations of federal pay-for-play, or &#8220;payola&#8221; law. The 
          agency&#8217;s investigation is based on a previous investigation by 
          New York Attorney General Elliot Spitzer. Spitzer has indicated there 
          is evidence that radio station groups and their employees violated both 
          state and federal law by accepting unlawful payments and other consideration 
          from major record labels in return for airplay, among other questionable 
          practices.
<p>&#8220;I hope this request will prompt the FCC to make a clear statement 
            that it will not tolerate payola in any form, in order to close any 
            supposed loopholes,&#8221; Feingold said. &#8220;I urge the FCC to 
            build on Attorney General Spitzer&#8217;s investigation and assert 
            its authority to prevent payola to the fullest extent possible.&#8221;</p>
          <p>Following a settlement that Spitzer reached in August 2005 with Sony 
            BMG, Chairman Martin released a statement indicating the seriousness 
            of payola and the FCC&#8217;s intention to investigate and prosecute 
            violations. Martin said that the FCC&#8217;s Enforcement Bureau had 
            been directed to review the settlement agreement reached by Sony BMG 
            and Spitzer, and investigate any incidents in which the agreement 
            discloses evidence of payola rule violations. Yet there still is a 
            lack of clarity about the FCC&#8217;s jurisdiction, leading to uncertainty 
            about whether loopholes exist in the federal law. Attorney General 
            Spitzer&#8217;s actions to shut down both traditional and new forms 
            of payola show that the FCC could and should exert more authority.</p>
          <p>&#8220;Radio listeners should not have to worry whether a song was 
            played because the station manager got a free laptop, or because the 
            station&#8217;s parent company is producing the artist&#8217;s upcoming 
            concert,&#8221; Feingold said. &#8220;I look forward to hearing from 
            Chairman Martin about his efforts to end abuse of our public airwaves.&#8221;</p>
          
        <p>Feingold is a strong supporter of stopping anti-competitive practices 
          in the radio industry. Most recently, he introduced the Radio and Concert 
          Disclosure and Competition Act of 2005, which proposes a multi-faceted 
          approach to the various entrenched forms of payola. The bill would simultaneously 
          strengthen the FCC&#8217;s ability to prove and punish violations, clearly 
          prohibit indirect payola, prevent cross-ownership from hindering fair 
          competition, and increase transparency through disclosure of payments 
          to radio stations from artists, labels, promoters and others who may 
          have an interest in improperly influencing airplay decisions. The legislation 
          would give people confidence that the songs they hear on the radio are 
          played because of perceived merit, and not because the station cut a 
          backdoor deal for financial gain.</p>
