<p>WASHINGTON - April 12 - The Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law and the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, Inc (LDF) have joined forces in a national voter empowerment campaign aimed at reaching survivors of the Gulf Coast Hurricanes who are eligible to vote in the New Orleans municipal elections this month.
<p>With thousands of New Orleanians dispersed across the country, LDF and the Lawyers’ Committee have embarked on an ambitious public outreach and voter protection drive to help clear hurdles, answer questions, and ensure that every displaced citizen can exercise his or her right to vote. 
<p>Voter Empowerment Centers in many of the cities with a significant number of displaced voters, backed by teams of lawyers are working together with the Election Protection Hotline (1-866-OUR-VOTE), to serve displaced voters in Atlanta, Baton Rouge, Houston, Dallas, and Nashville. These centers will provide voters with information and instructions on how to use the early voting provisions and vote by absentee ballot for the April 22nd primary election and the May 20th runoff election. 
<p>“One of the most fundamental principles of the right of return for displaced citizens is the right to equal access to the ballot and the right to exercise their voice through the franchise,” said Lawyers’ Committee Executive Director, Barbara R. Arnwine.
<p>“Our goal is to use our resources and expertise to ensure that the victims of Katrina are not once again devastated by the invisible storm of disfranchisement,” said Ted Shaw, director-counsel and president of LDF. 
<p>Public service announcements, KatrinaVote websites and a voter’s bill of rights have also been produced. For more information on the campaign visit <a href="http://www.katrinavote.org">www.katrinavote.org</a>, <a href="http://www.lawyerscommittee.org">www.lawyerscommittee.org</a>, or call 1-866-OUR-VOTE.
<p>To schedule interviews with representatives of LDF or the Lawyers’ Committee, or for more information, contact Kira Calm Lewis at 202-833-9771.
