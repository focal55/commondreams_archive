<p>HAMBURG, Germany - November 2 - Greenpeace today released new 
photographs of rapidly melting glaciers in Europe to call upon the 
world’s Governments attending next week’s Climate Conference in Nairobi 
to ‘wake up and smell the coffee’. The climate crisis is urgent: the 
science is indisputable, the moral obligation is unquestionable, and the 
economic imperative for urgent action is clear.

<p>New photographic comparisons reveal the full extent of Alpine glacier 
retreat. The comparisons of glacier masses show that melting has 
accelerated dramatically in the past few years. On average, twice as 
much glacier mass melted between 1991 and 2004 than between 1961 and 
1990. In the period from 2001 to 2004, glacier melting rates rose 
greatly. Greenland is now losing 240 cubic kilometres of ice each year – 
three times the rate before 2003.

<p>"These new findings are a yet another wake-up call. The glaciers are 
literally melting before our very eyes, but the politicians are still 
doing nothing but giving speeches", said Steve Sawyer, Greenpeace 
International Climate & Energy Policy Advisor. "Governments have lost 
their last excuse; they must stop their delaying tactics and heed the 
call for urgent action to protect the climate. We CAN prevent the worst 
of dangerous climate change, but we need to act now,”

<p>The spate of overwhelming evidence that has emerged over the last 12 
months includes:

<p>·    New and compelling scientific evidence pointing to the fact that 
climate change is upon us and happening faster than anyone could have 
predicted; we are at the threshold but we still have time to act. But 
that window will close within the next 10-15 years.
<p>·    That the cost of fighting climate change is easily affordable and 
orders of magnitude less than the economic havoc that will be wreaked by 
inaction.
<p>·    That developing countries are already being hit first and worst by 
the impacts of climate change, and the legal, moral and political 
obligation of the industrialized world to take the lead has never been 
clearer.
<p>·    Energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies are rapidly 
maturing and with the right support for massive deployment can and must 
play the major role in decarbonising our economies.

<p>“Governments need to agree a clear process in Nairobi so that post-2012 
action to protect the climate with at least 30% reductions from 
industrialized countries and expansion of carbon markets to drive clean 
technologies to developing countries is finalized no later than 2008,” 
said Sawyer. “The 163 governments that have signed up to the Kyoto 
Protocol need to put aside their short-term interests in favour of 
fighting this global menace. That is in everyone’s long-term interest.”
