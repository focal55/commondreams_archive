<p>WASHINGTON - May 9 - On May 10, AIDS activists will stage a vigil outside the shareholders' meeting of Gilead Sciences, a company based in Foster City. The vigil is sponsored by the American Medical Student Association, ACT UP East Bay, Global AIDS Alliance, Global Exchange, Peninsula Peace and Justice, Priority Africa Network, Student Global AIDS Campaign, and Survive AIDS.

 

<p><b>When:</b> 9:00 - 10:00am, Wednesday, May 10th

<p><b>Where:</b> Hyatt Regency, San Francisco Airport, 1333 Bayshore Highway, Burlingam, CA

 

<p>The protest, led by people living with AIDS from the San Francisco area, will call attention to the company's appalling slowness at making sure its AIDS drugs are available and affordable in poor and middle income countries.  About 8,000 people die of AIDS each day, 1500 of them children. In Africa, only 17% of people needing AIDS treatment is receiving it.

 

<p>Inside the meeting, shareholders will raise the urgency. Faith-based investors will offer a resolution which asks for a report from the board of directors on the impact of the HIV/AIDS pandemic on the business of the company.

 

<p>A letter to the company which urges that it change its policies has been sent by numerous Bay Area groups, as well as national and international organizations, including Network of African People living with HIV/AIDS, Global AIDS Alliance, Doctors without Borders and American Jewish World Service.  The letter was also signed by the Ecumenical Advocacy Alliance, a global action network of sixty-three churches and church-related organizations. 

 

<p>The letter is available online at:

 

<a href="http://www.globalaidsalliance.org/Gilead_Sciences_Action_Alert.cfm">http://www.globalaidsalliance.org/Gilead_Sciences_Action_Alert.cfm</a><p>Also on May 10, members of the Student Global AIDS Campaign will also stage a protest at a Gilead facility in Durham, North Carolina.

 

<p>Gilead's AIDS drugs Emtriva, Viread, and Truvada are life-saving medicines that could save the lives of millions of people around the world. Unfortunately, Gilead has yet to:

 

<p>1) Price Emtriva, Viread and Truvada affordably in middle-income countries,<br>


2) Sell the drugs in all countries where the price discount is offered<br>


3) Offer a voluntary, open license to generic producers,<br>


4) Register the drugs in all countries, and<br>


5) Expedite development of pediatric formulations

 

<p>Millions are dying while Gilead waits to act.
