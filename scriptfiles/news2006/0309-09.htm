<p>WASHINGTON - March 9 - So yesterday's protest  fell on deaf ears, everyone's ignoring the peace tent on the  quad, and there are more SUVs on campus than pages in Homer's  Iliad. </p>
<p>   Don't despair. Many students are ignoring their cynical  political science professors, abandoning daydreams of the 1960s  and joining a movement bent on proving that student activism is  far from dead.</p>
<p>   This year, more than 1,250 student groups will demand that the  U.S. government demonstrate an unequivocal commitment to women's  human rights. The activity will occur April 3-10, during Amnesty  International USA's National Week of Student Action (NWSA), an  annual week of heightened advocacy, which this year is aimed at  convincing U.S. Senators to support the Treaty for the Rights of  Women, officially named the Convention on the Elimination of all  Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW). The action week  will include protests, vigils, sit-ins and petition signing on  college campuses nationwide. The week is open to all; Amnesty  International membership is not required. Any groups or  individuals interested in participating should visit:  <a href="http://releases.usnewswire.com/redir.asp?ReleaseID=62089&Link=http://www.kintera.org/site/c.aeJLI0OCIrH/b.1144603/k.BD5A/Home.htm">http://www.kintera.org/site/c.aeJLI0OCIrH/b.1144603/k.BD5A/Home.htm</a> </p>
<p>   "Youth activism has an unprecedented ability to affect  change," said Njambi Good, AIUSA National Student and Youth  Program manager. "From the protests of the U.S. civil rights  movement to the pro-democracy demonstrations in Eastern Europe,  students have successfully demanded that their voices be heard.  This year, student activists are harnessing this power to put the  protection of women's human rights and equality at the top of the  U.S. agenda." </p>
<p>   During AIUSA's 9th annual week of student advocacy, hundreds  of students from Sitka High School in Alaska to the University of  Georgia will invade student unions, cafeterias and hallways  demanding Congressional action and calling for an end to  discrimination against women. Several student groups plan to  expand their usual advocacy repertoire by showing Iron Jawed  Angels, a film that takes a candid look at the women's suffrage  movement in the United States, while others intend to spread  awareness by sponsoring a dialogue wall, a place where  individuals can post stories of discrimination and abuse. Dozens  more are planning teach-ins, vigils, speakers, rallies and other  activities.</p>
<p>   Judging by student interest in this year's campaign, Amnesty  International expects that this year's NWSA will be more  successful than the last. The 2005 NWSA focused on preserving the  Sunset Provisions of the Patriot Act. Throughout the week, 421  groups, 26 other organizations and 197 individuals took action  through teach-ins, discussions, speakers, vigils, rallies and  other activities. Students at Ohio State stormed the university  library, chanting "kill the Patriot Act" as they checked out  books on Islamic fundamentalism and aviation. At New College in  Sarasota, Fla., students passed a resolution on their campus  opposing the Patriot Act. By the end of the week, activists had  sent more than 4,300 letters and postcards, collected 5,300  signatures and made more than 500 calls to Congress and the White  House.</p>
<p>   The goal of this year's NWSA is to convince Senators to add  their support of the Treaty for the Rights of Women to the  Congressional Record. The treaty is the only comprehensive  agreement to guarantee women's rights within the political,  cultural, economic, social and domestic sphere. The treaty serves  as a universal international standard for women's human rights  and provides governments with a framework to combat gender  inequality. </p>
<p>   Although an endorsement from the Senate Foreign Relations  Committee sent CEDAW to the entire Senate in 2002, Senators have  yet to vote on the treaty.  One hundred and eighty countries of  the world's 192 have already ratified CEDAW -- including all  industrialized countries except the United States.</p>
<p>   "Millions of women continue to suffer from violence,  discrimination and other abuse in societies that fail to protect  their rights both in law and in practice," said Jumana Musa,  AIUSA advocacy director for domestic human rights. "If the United  States fails to take this treaty seriously, how can we expect the  same from other countries with little respect for women's  rights?" </p>
<p>   Student activists are the backbone of AIUSA; the  organization's 1,600 student groups make up more than 70 percent  of its membership. In the past year, support from student  activists played a pivotal role in freeing two prisoners of  conscience, pressuring Congress to pass the anti-torture  amendment and reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act. </p>
