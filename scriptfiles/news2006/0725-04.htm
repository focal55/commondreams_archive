<p>WASHINGTON - July 25 -  



Congressman Dennis J. Kucinich (D-OH), Ranking Democratic on the House Government Reform Subcommittee on National Security, Emerging Threats, and International Relations, gave the following floor speech today on the continuing violence in the Middle East: 

<p>"At this historic moment the United States is failing in its moral obligation to bring a cessation of the violence in the Middle East.  This policy of inaction will have great consequences for the region, the world and safety of our nation and our allies.

<p>"The United States stands alone in our ability to bring an end to the violence in the Middle East, relieve the humanitarian catastrophe that has enveloped the people of Lebanon, Palestine and Israel.

<p>"In the short term, we must call for an end to the violence.  Then, without preconditions, we must bring all parties in the region to negotiate a long-term settlement that will be enforced by peacekeepers.  This is the purpose of House Concurrent Resolution 450.

<p>"As we demonstrate concern about the plight of the Israelis, so we must not be indifferent to the plight of the Arabs, Muslims and Christians, and all others who are suffering the destruction of their homes, their families, their hopes, their dreams.

<p>"As the violence continues, with no end in sight, and with civilian casualties on the rise, this is the moment to call for the end of fear and the beginning of hope.  House Concurrent Resolution 450 does just that."

<p><i>Congressman Kucinich last week introduced H. Con. Res. 450 a resolution calling, "upon the President to appeal to all sides in the current crisis in the Middle East for an immediate cessation of violence and to commit the United States diplomats to multi-party negotiations with no preconditions."
