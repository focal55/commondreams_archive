<p>WASHINGTON - July 28 -
ImpeachPAC today unveiled the progressive blogosphere's first <a href="http://impeachpac.org/lamont-ad-1%20" target="_new">TV ad</a> in the closely-watched Democratic primary battle between incumbent Senator Joe Lieberman and his progressive challenger, Ned Lamont. The ad can be viewed here:
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYes93Byn-s%20" target="_new">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYes93Byn-s </a>
<p>The ad (<A href="http://impeachpac.org/lamont-ad-1-text" target="_new">full text here</A>) focuses on a story first reported by the <A 
href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/07/washington/07recruit.html" target="_new"><i>New York Times</i></A> on July 7 that "recruiting shortfalls caused by the war in Iraq have allowed 'large numbers of neo-Nazis and skinhead extremists' to infiltrate the military." (<A href="http://impeachpac.org/milinazi-nyt" target="_new">Full text here</A>.)
<p>The <i>Times </i>article is based on an in-depth report by the Southern Poverty Law Center entitled "<a href="http://www.splcenter.org/intel/news/item.jsp?aid=66%20" target="_new">A Few Bad Men</a>."
<p>The report quotes Pentagon investigator Scott Barfield, who said "Recruiters are knowingly allowing neo-Nazis and white supremacists to join the armed forces, and commanders don't remove them from the military even after we positively identify them as extremists or gang members." 

<p>Mr. Barfield provided evidence to the Pentagon on 320 extremists at Fort Lewis in Washington State in the past year, but only two were discharged. 

<p>He said investigators also uncovered an online network of 57 extremists. "They're communicating with each other about weapons, about recruiting, about keeping their identities secret, about organizing within the military. Several of these individuals have since been deployed to combat missions in Iraq." 

<p>The report identifies Airman Robert Lee West, 23, a Neo-Nazi extremist who is on active duty at Warner Robins Air Force Base in Georgia. Until recently, West maintained a personal web page at EveryonesSpace which featured photos of himself standing in front of a Nazi flag. The page was removed shortly after the <i>New York Times</i> article appeared. 

<a href="http://www.splcenter.org/intel/news/item.jsp?pid=83%20">http://www.splcenter.org/intel/news/item.jsp?pid=83 </a><p>In his "About Me" section, he wrote: "I train most days for marksmanship, combat, demolition, politics, economics, religion, military tactics, oratory, and propaganda. I will give my life for a cause greater than my own. My mind and spirit shall ensure life for my people, and death for yours. I shall fight until I have achieved victory. Just remember when you speak to me that I don't play by ZOG [Zionist Occupation Government] rules and I will not hesitate to sever your subclavian artery." 

<p>The term "ZOG" is used widely by neo-Nazis in the United States, including the <a href="http://www.nsm88.com/index2.html%20" target="_new">National Socialist Movement</a>.
<p>It is included in the list of "<a href="http://www.adl.org/hate_symbols/acronyms_zog.asp%20" target="_new">racist acronyms</a>" maintained by the Anti-Defamation League:

<p>According to ImpeachPAC president Bob Fertik, "ImpeachPAC is running this TV ad in Connecticut because the infiltration of neo-Nazis in our military is a direct consequence of the disastrous Iraq War that Senator Joe Lieberman enthusiastically supports." 

<p>"Because this war was based entirely on lies, many patriotic young Americans are refusing to enlist. So George Bush's Pentagon is turning a blind eye to neo-Nazis and other extremists even after they are identified by Pentagon investigators. Joe Lieberman made history in 2000 as the first Jewish-American candidate for Vice President, which makes his lack of action on neo-Nazis especially shocking. Why didn't Lieberman use his seniority on the Senate Armed Services Committee to demand the immediate removal of all extremists - or even to hold hearings?" Fertik asked. 

<p>"Extremists have infiltrated our military before with deadly consequences," Fertik said. "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_McVeigh%20" target="_new">Timothy McVeigh</a> formed his extremist ideas in the military, and ultimately murdered 167 people when he <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma_City_bombing" target="_new">bombed</a> the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City in the nation's worst terrorist attack before September 11.
<p>"Military extremists have also targeted African-Americans for violence. Shortly after the Oklahoma City bombing, racist soldiers in the 82nd Airborne at Fort Bragg <a href="http://www.cnn.com/US/9512/ft_bragg/%20" target="_new">murdered</a> a black couple to earn a skinhead tatoo," Fertik said.
<p>ImpeachPAC (ImpeachPAC.org) was founded last November after polls showed a majority of Americans believe George Bush should be impeached for lying about Iraq. ImpeachPAC has endorsed six candidates who actively support the impeachment of George Bush and Dick Cheney and contributed the maximum of $5,000 to each candidate. 

<p>Today ImpeachPAC is <a href="http://impeachpac.org/lamont-ad-1-censorship" target="_new">moving in a new direction</a> by running "independent expenditure" campaigns in high-profile races to highlight impeachable offenses that the media has ignored. "Of course the illegal and catastrophic Iraq War is the #1 impeachment issue," Fertik said. "But for too many Americans, the war seems far away and therefore less important than the many issues here at home. So we decided to highlight one Iraq War issue that will affect us right here at home - the infiltration of neo-Nazis and racist extremists into the US military." 

<p>"We hope these ads will stimulate debate in the blogosphere and beyond about the disastrous consequences of the Iraq War, and persuade voters to defeat those politicians - like Senator Joe Lieberman - who continue to support this war," Fertik said.
