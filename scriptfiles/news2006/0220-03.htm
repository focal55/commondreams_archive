<p>OMAHA, Nebraska - February 20 - Coldplay is  championing the Make Trade Fair campaign during the second leg of  their &quot;Twisted Logic&quot; tour, January through April 2006. The  concerts feature a call to sign Oxfam's Big Noise petition  calling on world leaders to change trade rules that deny millions  of farmers around the world the benefits of trade.</p>
<p>   &quot;Economically, unfair trade will benefit nobody in the long  run, as poorer countries will be bled totally dry and will become  unable to produce anything.&quot; said Coldplay's front man, Chris  Martin.</p>
<p>   Worldwide, the Big Noise petition has gathered over 17 million  signatures, many from those living in developing countries such  as Bangladesh, Ethiopia, and Zambia. Oxfam delivered the Big  Noise to world trade ministers in December at the WTO Ministerial  Conference in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>   Coldplay's Chris Martin has witnessed firsthand the crippling  effects of unfair trade rules on small farmers after traveling to  both Ghana and Haiti with Oxfam. He began working with Oxfam in  2002 and has since participated in a number of high profile  moments in the campaign, including an international ad campaign  and delivering the Big Noise petition to world leaders.</p>

<p>   &quot;How on earth could anybody stand in a field with these people  and say that it's the right thing to do to dump their excess  produce cheaply on a third world country? It's beyond me,&quot; said  Martin. &quot;But the truth is, the people responsible haven't talked  to the farmers in the areas affected.&quot;</p>
<p>   Trade has the power to lift millions of people out of poverty  but instead millions are struggling because of the current unfair  trading system.</p>

<p>   Make Trade Fair volunteers will be at each show signing up  supporters and handing out more information on the Make Trade  Fair campaign.</p>
