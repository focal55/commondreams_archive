<p>WASHINGTON - January 11 - Drug Policy Alliance New Jersey has acheived a big victory for sentencing reform in the lame duck session of the state legislature. The New Jersey Senate and Assembly passed legislation on Monday, January 9, that would give judges discretion not to revoke people’s drivers’ licenses for drug offenses. 
 
<p>Currently, it is mandatory that anyone convicted of a drug offense (no matter how minor, and even if it is unrelated to driving or driver safety) lose his or her license for six to 24 months!  This harsh law does nothing to reduce drug use and hinders employment, drug treatment access, child care and other options for those convicted of drug offenses. Acting Governor Codey is expected to sign the reform bill, and once he does so judges will have the discretion not to impose this ineffective and counterproductive penalty.
 
<p>Two other areas in which Drug Policy Alliance New Jersey had hoped for a vote in the lame duck session were <a href="http://www.drugpolicy.org/about/stateoffices/newjersey/njschoolzone.cfm">school zone reform</a>, which would reduce the size of the state's ineffective "drug-free school zones," and <a href="http://www.drugpolicy.org/about/stateoffices/newjersey/chnj/">syringe access</a>. The bills on these issues did not come to a vote, but will be reintroduced in the new session, which started with the convening of the new legislature on January 10. Drug Policy Alliance New Jersey will continue its fight in the 2006 session to get these bills passed.<!-- #EndEditable -->
