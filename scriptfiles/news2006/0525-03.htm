<p>SAN FRANCISCO - May 25 - A federal court will  hear arguments today in a lawsuit brought by San Leandro,  California gun dealer Trader Sports, in a last-ditch attempt to  prevent revocation of its federal firearms license. The gun shop  is slated to lose its federal license June 1, after committing  &quot;thousands of violations&quot; of federal law, according to the U.S.  Department of Justice.</p>
<p>   In advance of the hearing, the Brady Center to Prevent Gun  Violence issued a new report, Trading in Death, highlighting  decades of legal violations by Trader Sports. The report includes  detailed information on Trader Sports' record as the second  largest supplier of crime guns of any retailer in the nation. In  2005, 447 crime guns were traced to Trader Sports. Law  enforcement recovers crime guns sold by Trader Sports at an  average rate of more than one per day.  </p>
<p>   The report is available online at <a href="http://releases.usnewswire.com/redir.asp?ReleaseID=66427&Link=http://www.bradycenter.org">http://www.bradycenter.org</a>.</p>
<p>   The report also highlights an attempt by the gun lobby to  protect rogue dealers like Trader Sports with new federal  legislation. Congress is currently considering H.R. 5092, a bill  that would gut the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and  Explosives' (ATF) power to revoke licenses from corrupt gun  dealers. H.R. 5092 would also allow Trader Sports to continue  operating despite revocation of its federal firearms license,  through years of legal appeals.</p>
<p>   &quot;Trader Sports has supplied more criminals with firearms than  almost any other gun dealer in the nation,&quot; said Dennis A.  Henigan, legal director of the Brady Center to Prevent Gun  Violence. &quot;Congress should strengthen ATF's power to revoke  licenses of corrupt dealers rather than enacting new special  interest laws to protect them.&quot;</p>
<p>   The hearing will take place today at 2 p.m. before Chief Judge  Vaughn R. Walker of the United States District Court for the  Northern District of California, in Courtroom 6 on the 17th floor  of the Federal Building at 450 Golden Gate Ave. in San Francisco.  The hearing will likely determine whether Trader Sports must  cease operations on June 1.</p>
<p>   On March 30, the Brady Center launched a new Campaign Against  Illegal Guns. As part of this campaign, the Center inaugurated  Gun Industry Watch, a comprehensive research effort to monitor  the gun industry and expose industry practices that endanger  innocent lives. Trading in Death is the second report issued by  Gun Industry Watch.
