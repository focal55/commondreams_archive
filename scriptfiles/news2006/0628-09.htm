<p>WASHINGTON - June 28 - In a letter sent today  to all House members, reform groups urged representatives to  support and co-sponsor the new, strong lobbying and ethics reform  package Reps. Christopher Shays (R-Conn.) and Marty Meehan (D- Mass.) introduced last week. 
<p>   The reform groups include the Campaign Legal Center, Common  Cause, Democracy 21, the League of Women Voters, Public Citizen  and U.S. PIRG.</p>
<p>   The letter points out a new USA Today/Gallup poll that affirms  that voters are deeply concerned about corruption in government.</p>
<p>   The letter states, &quot;According to a USA Today/Gallup Poll  conducted June 23 - June 25, 2006, 85 percent of respondents said  that corruption in government would be an extremely or very  important issue to their vote for Congress this year. Corruption  in government tied with the economy and ranked just below the  situation in Iraq as the top rated issues in the poll.&quot;</p>
<p>   Following is the text of the letter:</p>
<p>   June 28, 2006</p>
<p>   Dear Representative,</p>
<p>   Last week, Representatives Christopher Shays (R-CT) and Marty  Meehan (D-MA) introduced new, strong lobbying and ethics reform  legislation, to address the corruption and lobbying scandals in  Congress.</p>
<p>   Our groups strongly urge you to support and co-sponsor this  package, which represents real reform.</p>
<p>   The reform groups include the Campaign Legal Center, Common  Cause, Democracy 21, the League of Women Voters, Public Citizen  and U.S. PIRG.</p>
<p>    The lobbying and ethics bills passed by the House and Senate  this year, and awaiting a House-Senate conference, are cosmetic  reforms that have been correctly labeled as phony reforms by  editorial pages throughout the country.</p>
<p>   Regardless of whether an illusory reform bill is enacted this  year, Congress needs to enact real reforms to address the root  causes of the worst congressional corruption scandals in decades. </p>
<p>   These corruption problems -- and their consequences for  democracy -- are not going away. Congress must respond decisively  and effectively to the deep concerns of the American people about  the undue influence of money and lobbyists in Congress. </p>
<p>   According to a USA Today/Gallup Poll conducted June 23 - June  25, 2006, 85 percent of respondents said that corruption in  government would be an extremely or very important issue to their  vote for Congress this year. Corruption in government tied with  the economy and ranked just below the situation in Iraq as the  top rated issues in the poll. </p>
<p>   Addressing the corruption in government problems requires the  establishment of public financing for congressional elections and  the passage of strong lobbying and ethics reforms.</p>
<p>   The new Shays-Meehan lobbying and ethics legislation, H.R.  5677, includes provisions to:</p>
<p>   -- Prohibit private interests that lobby Congress from paying  for trips by Members;</p>
<p>   -- Require Members to pay charter rates, rather than reduced  fares, for the use of company planes made available by  corporations for their travel;</p>
<p>   -- Ban gifts to Members;</p>
<p>   -- Establish an Office of Public Integrity to help enforce  congressional ethics rules and lobbying disclosure laws;</p>
<p>   -- Require lobbyists to disclose the campaign funds and  financial benefits they provide to assist Members;</p>
<p>   -- Require disclosure of the amounts spent by professional  lobbying firms and lobbying groups on campaigns to generate  lobbying of Congress by the public; and </p>
<p>   -- Slow the revolving door.</p>
<p>   An editorial in The Washington Post on June 25, 2006 described  the new Shays-Meehan bill as &quot;the kind of bold, meaningful reform  that congressional leaders promised -- and promptly abandoned --  at the start of 2006.&quot;</p>
<p>   We strongly urge you to sponsor the Shays-Meehan lobbying and  ethics reform package and also to indicate publicly that you will  oppose any efforts to enact illusory reforms.</p>
