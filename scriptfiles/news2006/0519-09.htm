<p>NEW YORK  - May 19 - The American Civil Liberties Union announced today that it will 
continue to pursue a fair hearing for Khaled El-Masri, a victim of the CIA 
policy of illegal abduction and detention known as extraordinary rendition. The 
ACLU said that the government is abusing the state secrets privilege to cover up 
its kidnapping and torture of an innocent man.<BR><BR>The U.S. District Court for 
the Eastern District of Virginia denied El-Masri access to justice yesterday 
because, according to the court, the simple fact of holding proceedings would 
jeopardize state secrets, a position advanced by the CIA. <BR><BR>"The court's 
decision gives the government a blank check to shield even its most shameful 
conduct from any scrutiny or accountability," said Ben Wizner, an attorney with 
the ACLU. "Depriving Khaled El-Masri of his day in court on the ground that the 
government cannot disclose facts that the whole world already knows only 
compounds the brutal treatment he endured."<BR><BR>In his opinion, Judge T.S. Ellis 
III held that CIA properly invoked the state secrets to dismiss El-Masri's 
lawsuit, notwithstanding the vast amount of public information concerning 
El-Masri's claims. The court acknowledged, however, that "if El-Masri's 
allegations are true or essentially true, then all fair-minded people, including 
those who believe that state secrets must be protected, that this lawsuit cannot 
proceed, and that renditions are a necessary step to take in this war, must also 
agree that El-Masri has suffered injuries as a result of our country's mistake 
and deserves a remedy."<BR><BR>The ACLU said the government has been invoking the 
state secrets privilege with increasing regularity in an effort to avoid the 
exposure of illegal and immoral practices, including, most recently, in an 
effort to dismiss lawsuits challenging illegal NSA wiretapping. Yet in this 
case, the ACLU argued that all the information needed to establish CIA 
culpability is already public.<BR><BR>The landmark lawsuit charges that former CIA 
Director George Tenet violated U.S. and universal human rights laws when he 
authorized agents to abduct El-Masri, beat him, drug him and transport him to a 
secret CIA prison in Afghanistan. The corporations that owned and operated the 
airplanes are also named in the case. The CIA continued to hold El-Masri 
incommunicado in the notorious "Salt Pit" prison in Afghanistan long after his 
innocence was known. Five months after his abduction El-Masri was deposited at 
night, without explanation on a hill in Albania, never having been charged with 
a crime. <BR><BR>In a related development, the U.N. Committee Against Torture today 
issued a series of recommendations to bring the U.S. into compliance with the 
Convention Against Torture. Included is a direct charge to "Cease the rendition 
of suspects, in particular by its intelligence agencies, to States where they 
face a real risk of torture."<BR><BR>Recently, a special committee of the European 
Parliament issued an interim report concluding that the CIA has on several 
occasions illegally kidnapped and detained individuals in European countries. 
The report also found that the CIA detained and then secretly used airlines to 
transfer persons to countries like Egypt and Afghanistan, which routinely use 
torture during interrogations. Members of the European investigative committee 
came to the United States last week meet with the ACLU and Members of Congress. 
A parliamentary inquiry into El-Masri's kidnapping is also currently ongoing in 
Germany.<BR><BR>The ACLU has also called on a United Nations human rights 
investigative body, the Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances, 
to conduct a full investigation into the United States' "extraordinary 
rendition" program.<BR><BR>El-Masri is represented by Wizner, Ann Beeson, and 
Melissa Goodman of the ACLU. Steven Watt is a senior human rights advisor on the 
case.<BR><BR>Background and briefs on the case are online at: <A class=noline_blue href="http://www.aclu.org/rendition">www.aclu.org/rendition</A>
