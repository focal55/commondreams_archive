<p>NEW YORK - December 13 - The Center for Justice &amp;  Democracy (CJ&amp;D) today called the American Tort Reform  Association's &quot;Judicial Hellholes 2006&quot; report attacking judges  in several regions around the country, &quot;vicious and undemocratic,  not to mention dishonest and ungrounded.&quot;  In its report released  today, ATRA launches a ferocious attack on fair and independent  judges based on the apparent views of its members that include  polluters, tobacco companies, and the insurance industry, among  other industries.</p>
<p>   &quot;Coming just weeks after elections in which voters soundly  rejected judicial candidates backed by ATRA and other corporate- backed groups, this report is sheer nonsense, and certainly out  of touch with the American public,&quot; said Joanne Doroshow,  Executive Director for CJ&amp;D.  &quot;What's more, it is a shameful  violation of the very foundations of our democracy.  The American  public does not want judges to have to look over their shoulder  to calculate how their decisions might play with corporate-backed  special interest groups like this.&quot;</p>
<p>   Doroshow added, &quot;ATRA believes that rulings by judges that  hold industries accountable are bad for our country, harming  local economies, when, in fact, the opposite is true.  The  economies in areas attacked by ATRA are strong and growing and  one obvious reason is that these areas are not havens for  corporate wrongdoing.&quot;</p>
<p>   For example, three counties are attacked in Illinois, yet all  three areas are experiencing incredible business and employment  growth, with Chicago/Cook County as corporate America's top  metropolitan area for the corporate facility projects in the  country.  South Florida is also attacked, yet South Florida is  experiencing spectacular growth, and its cities are consistently  ranked among the best cities to do business in America. West  Virginia and the Rio Grande Valley and the Gulf Coast of Texas  are also experiencing great job and business growth, while being  called &quot;Hellholes.&quot;   See, Facts About ATRA's So-Called &quot;Judicial  Hellholes,&quot; <a href="http://releases.usnewswire.com/redir.asp?ReleaseID=77522&Link=http://centerjd.org">http://centerjd.org</a></p>
<p>   According to Doroshow, &quot;With money and politics already  dominating the executive and legislative branches, our court  system is one of the only places left in America where injured  citizens can successfully confront powerful industries and  institutions and stop misconduct.  The last thing we need are  bogus attacks from groups like ATRA that threaten judicial  independence, a cornerstone of our democracy, for the sake of  restricting legitimate lawsuits against corporate wrongdoers.&quot;</p>
