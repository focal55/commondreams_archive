<p>WASHINGTON - November 30 - Amnesty International  will continue to press the Council of the European Union (EU) to  publicly and unequivocally oppose any further complicity in the  U.S.-led rendition program within the EU. Member states must act  to ensure accountability for the grave human rights violations  that have already occurred including illegal transfers, torture  or ill-treatment, arbitrary detention and enforced  &quot;disappearance.&quot; The EU must call on the U.S. government to cease  the current practices of rendition and illegal detention and  bring to justice those who have been involved in these practices. </p>
<p>   The need to end participation in the rendition program is  underscored by the recently released findings of the European  Parliament's Temporary Committee investigation into renditions  and secret detention.   </p>
<p>   &quot;The EU is playing a game of 'hear no evil, see no evil and  speak no evil' by not only refusing to acknowledge its  participation in this deplorable mission but also failing to  rebuke the United States for the program's mere existence,&quot; said  Larry Cox, Amnesty International USA executive director. &quot;As far  as Amnesty International is concerned, silence equals  endorsement.&quot;</p>
<p>   In the words of the committee's rapporteur, Claudio Fava, the  EU must stress that &quot;the appropriate legal framework for  governing the international fight against terrorism is criminal  law and international human rights ... the protection of  fundamental rights must never be compromised.&quot; The draft report  supports and elaborates on Amnesty International's findings of  the involvement and complicity of EU member states, candidate and  associate countries, in the U.S. rendition program. </p>
<p>   The report details evidence of direct complicity in rendition  cases by security services and other authorities in Italy,  Sweden, United Kingdom, Germany, Macedonia and Bosnia- Herzegovina. Furthermore, it highlights that security forces of  the UK, Germany and Turkey took advantage of the situation by  interrogating individuals who had been subjected to rendition. </p>
<p>   The Temporary Committee also found evidence of at least 1,245  flights by CIA aircraft that stopped over on European territory.  These included 336 stopovers in Germany, 170 in UK, 147 in  Ireland, 91 in Portugal, 68 in Spain, 64 in Greece, 57 in Cyprus,  21 in Romania and 11 in Poland. Out of those, several flights had  the U.S. detention facility in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, as their  origin or destination, including flights that stopped over in  Germany, Spain, Portugal, Romania and Poland. </p>
<p>   In light of the evidence found by Amnesty International, the  EU, the media and others, each and every government must  investigate the crimes that have occurred in and through European  territory. While investigations have been undertaken in Spain,  Germany, Italy and Bosnia-Herzegovina into the renditions program  and the authorities' alleged role therein, many governments,  notably Austria, Poland, Macedonia and Romania, have failed to  initiate such thorough, independent and impartial investigations. </p>
<p>   &quot;Make no mistake, human rights violations occurred in the  renditions program,&quot; said Cox. &quot;The lack of transparency shown by  the EU Council and its bodies, including failing to fully  cooperate with the Temporary Committee's investigation, makes one  wonder what other horrendous abuses may be happening in the  context of the war on terror.&quot;</p>
<p>   The draft report supports the proposal of the Secretary  General of the Council of Europe to draft principles and  guidelines to enhance control over the activities of domestic and  foreign security services on the territory of member states;  better safeguards and controls over air traffic transiting  through European states; and ending impunity for the perpetrators  of serious human rights violations. </p>
<p>   The draft report makes a number of other recommendations  including the call for the closure of Guantanamo Bay and for  European countries to accept the return of their citizens and  residents who are being held illegally by U.S. authorities. </p>
<p>   In addition to these recommendations, Amnesty International  continues to urge all EU member states, candidates and associate  countries to ensure the accountability of intelligence agencies  and make sure all countries' full cooperation with ongoing  national and international investigations on rendition and secret  detention, including by providing them with access to all  relevant people and information. </p>
<p>   Amnesty International has issued several reports on  renditions, (see below) and the organization will continue to  monitor and press for appropriate accountability at all levels. </p>
