<p>WASHINGTON - February 6 - In last week's State of the Union address, President Bush admitted that the United States is suffering from an oil addiction.  Less than one week later, he is already having a relapse. Today, the President released his 2007 federal budget request to Congress- and once again, it includes revenues from drilling the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.

<p>Americans are ready for a new energy future, and greeted last week's vision with enthusiasm.  President Bush's request for one more destructive fix is a disappointment.  The President is squandering a historic opportunity to lead America out of its energy crisis.  Rather than decisively putting clean, cheap, smart energy solutions to work, the President’s budget is little more than a repackaging of the same old wish-list for corporate lobbyists that fails to provide America with adequate environmental protection, security, or job creation.  

<p>By investing in modern technology, America could cut its dependence on dirty fossil fuels while saving consumers money, preserving treasured places, and keeping Americans safer.  An energy policy that puts our families ahead of corporate lobbyists would invest in smarter technology to lower energy bills and create jobs, invest in renewable energy and energy efficiency, and raise fuel economy standards to save more oil than the United States currently imports from the entire Persian Gulf or could ever take out of the Arctic Refuge.  

<p>President Bush's drill-it-all approach is a tired scheme that was defeated in last year's budget. In 2005, drilling advocates tried every trick in the book to advance the controversial proposal to drill the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.  They attached the measure to the House-passed energy bill, inserted it into the Federal budget, and Senator Stevens even made a last-ditch effort to add it to the must-pass Defense Appropriations bill.  Despite Congress's rejection of these back door tactics, the Bush Administration continues to push a failed energy policy.  This year's blueprint includes four billion dollars in anticipated revenues to be realized through the sale of oil leases in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.  

<p>President Bush's budget also sets aside additional money to pave the way for more oil and gas development on our public lands and off our coasts.  The budget includes funds to facilitate and accelerate permitting for increased drilling on Bureau of Land Management lands, and pumps more money to study expanding oil and gas development in deepwater areas off the outer continental shelf.  

<p>Congress and the Administration must stop wasting energy on these dead-end drilling schemes and chart a course to a cleaner energy future.
