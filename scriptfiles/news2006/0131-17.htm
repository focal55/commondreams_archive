<p>WASHINGTON - January 31 - "Tonight President Bush briefly addressed some of the most pressing domestic policy issues facing American workers like health care and immigration reform, but working families desperately need to hear more than incremental tactics that merely serve as band-aids."
<p>The President acknowledged the number one economic issue facing Americans - health care - but simply proposing stop-gap measures like Health Savings Accounts, tax credits and computerizing our nation's medical records will not solve the fundamental problems we face. In fact, these policies will do very little to help Americans struggling to afford even the most basic health coverage and do nothing to cover those who lack insurance at all.</p>

<p>"Our health care system requires real reform that works for everyone, not just the wealthy and the healthy. It's time for the right dialogue about the crisis to take center stage.</p>

<p>"The employer-based health care system is a relic and it's not working for millions of Americans. Working families are getting squeezed with no end in sight, millions are going without any coverage at all and businesses are struggling to compete under the weight of skyrocketing insurance costs.&#160; Americans want their leaders to find a solution to this crisis now.</p>

<p>"The President also addressed the critical need to reform our broken immigration system but once again, his proposals fall far short of the comprehensive solution our nation desperately needs.</p>

<p>"Our laws are outdated and unenforceable and we've lost control of our borders.</p>

<p>"The current immigration system is so eroded that there are few orderly, legal channels to work in this country and this drives many immigrants and their families into the underground economy. There, workers are forced to work for substandard pay and in hazardous conditions which undermines standards for all workers and breeds division in our communities.</p>

<p>"America needs comprehensive immigration reform that creates order, takes control of our borders, channels immigrants through the American legal system, and provides a path to citizenship for hardworking, taxpaying immigrants.</p>

<p>"American workers are counting on the President and Congress to work together in a bipartisan fashion and get the job done. That means finding an American solution to the health care crisis and passing comprehensive immigration reform so American workers and our businesses can remain competitive in the global economy."</p>
