<p>LITTLE ROCK, Arkansas - August 23 - A federal judge in Little Rock today agreed with the 
American Civil Liberties Union that Arkansas&#8217; rule for getting third party 
candidates on the ballot is unconstitutional. 
<P>&#8220;This is a great victory for the people of Arkansas,&#8221; said Rita Sklar, 
Executive Director of the ACLU of Arkansas, which filed this case jointly with 
the ACLU Voting Rights Project.&nbsp; &#8220;Arkansans who want to run for political 
office and have political views different from those of the Democratic or 
Republican parties can now more easily participate in the political 
process.&nbsp; Voters also win because they are given more opportunity to 
support candidates who reflect their political views.&#8221;</P>
<P>The court ordered the state to put Green Party candidates on the ballot for 
this coming November election.&nbsp; In order to get on the ballot, Arkansas 
election law has required that an independent candidate provide 10,000 
signatures of voters in the previous gubernatorial or presidential election, but 
that third party candidates must provide a full three percent of those 
signatures -- a much higher threshold.&nbsp; The judge said this rule violated 
Green Party members&#8217; and candidates&#8217; rights to association, and impedes their 
right to advance their political goals.<BR><BR>On May 30, 2006, the Green Party of 
Arkansas submitted approximately 18,000 signatures to the Secretary of State in 
support of its New Political Party Petition -- more than the 10,000 valid 
signatures required of an independent candidate, but clearly fewer than 24,171 
that would have been required to satisfy the three percent mandate. The 
Secretary of State refused to accept the petition, claiming it lacked the 
requisite number of signatures.<BR><BR>The ACLU filed a lawsuit on June 27, asking 
the judge to declare the rule for third parties unconstitutional and to order 
the state to put Green Party candidates on the ballot.&nbsp; Today the judge 
affirmed the ACLU&#8217;s position.&nbsp; The state&#8217;s argument for the rule was that 
the state had a legitimate interest in ensuring parties have a &#8216;modicum of 
support&#8217;, or else the ballot could become &#8220;crowded,&#8221; a condition where a ballot 
is found too cluttered with names to be really useful for the voter.&nbsp; The 
state also said the third party had to demonstrate a &#8220;modicum of support&#8221; to get 
on the ballot.<BR><BR>Directly addressing the state&#8217;s arguments the court today 
found that: &#8220;Arkansas&#8217;s three percent requirement in its party recognition 
scheme is not narrowly drawn to serve a compelling state interest.&nbsp; <EM>The 
10,000 signature threshold is a sufficient modicum of support to serve the 
state&#8217;s interest in avoiding cluttered ballots and the evidence shows quite 
clearly that the three percent requirement is much higher than necessary as it 
imposes a severe burden under the First and Fourteenth Amendments on the 
associational rights of the Green Party and the candidates who are plaintiffs in 
this case&#8230;.&#8221;</EM> (emphasis added).<BR><BR>&nbsp;&#8220;State law has effectively denied ballot 
access to third parties,&#8221; said ACLU of Arkansas staff attorney Holly 
Dickson.&nbsp; &#8220;This law has been so burdensome that third parties really could 
not sponsor a slate of candidates.&nbsp; Democracy doesn&#8217;t function unless the 
people are heard.&nbsp; This decision puts every Arkansan in a better position 
to have their voices heard.&nbsp; That&#8217;s what this country is all about.&#8221;</P>
