<p>WASHINGTON - January 11 -<p>   -- Maryland Wal-Mart Worker Calls on State Legislators to Support Fair Share Health Care Legislation </p>
<p>   -- Maryland House Speaker Michael Busch and Maryland Democratic Party Chairman Terry Lierman Join Wal-Mart Worker at Press Conference </p>
<p>   Today, Jan. 11, for the first time in the state of Maryland, a current Wal-Mart worker will bravely speak out about the need for Maryland legislators to support Fair Share Health Care legislation. The uninsured Wal-Mart worker will be discussing their personal struggle and the significant emotional cost their family bears because Wal-Mart fails to provide affordable health care to its workers. </p>
<p>   The Wal-Mart worker will also be delivering an open letter to all 188 state legislators urging them to override Gov. Ehrlich's veto and make Fair Share Health Care the law in Maryland. </p>
<p>   The Wal-Mart worker will be joined by House Speaker Michael Busch and Maryland Democratic Party Chairman Terry Lierman. Speaker Busch and Democratic Party Chair Lierman will discuss the impending override vote and why Fair Share Health Care legislation is so important for Maryland taxpayers and all Maryland workers. </p>
<p>   WHAT: Press conference with current Maryland Wal-Mart worker</p>
<p>   WHERE: 7 School Street, Annapolis, Md., Near State Capitol</p>
<p>   WHEN: TODAY, Wednesday, Jan. 11, 4 p.m. ET</p>
<p>   WHO: </p>
<p>   -- Current Maryland Wal-Mart Worker</p>
<p>   -- Maryland House Speaker Michael Busch</p>
<p>   -- Maryland State Democratic Party Chairman Terry Lierman</p>
<p>   -- Paul Blank, campaign director, WakeUpWalMart.com</p>
<p>   Background:</p>
<p>   The &quot;Wal-Mart Health Care Crisis&quot; now threatens the state of Maryland. Wal-Mart, a company with over $10 billion dollars in net profits, fails to provide healthcare for more than 51 percent of its 1.3 million workers. Most disturbingly, Wal-Mart admits nearly one out of every two Wal-Mart workers' children are uninsured or on public assistance. </p>
<p>   In fact, in 12 of 13 states with available data, Wal-Mart workers rely on public health care, like Medicaid, more than any other employer. As a result, in state after state, Wal-Mart is directly shifting its healthcare responsibilities onto American taxpayers. </p>
