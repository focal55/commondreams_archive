<p>WASHINGTON - June 20 - The House Ethics  Committee is expected to shortly announce new rules that would  provide for the Committee to pre-approve privately-funded trips  taken by House members in this country and around the world.</p>
<p>   ''Pre-approval by the thoroughly discredited House Ethics  Committee of privately-funded trips for House members is simply a  way for the Committee to legitimize and perpetuate the existing  system of widespread travel abuses by House members,'' according  to Democracy 21 President Fred Wertheimer.</p>
<p>   ''A pre-approval process will ensure that private interest  influence-seekers can continue to buy access and influence with  House members by providing them with substantial financial perks  in the form of expensive trips to desired locations domestically  and throughout the world,'' Wertheimer said.</p>
<p>   According to a recent study issued by the Center for Public  Integrity (CPI), the Representatives on the House Ethics  Committee and their staff alone spent nearly $1 million on  privately-funded trips during the period from January 2000 to  June 2005.</p>
<p>   Rep. Howard Berman (D-Calif.), the Ranking Democrat on the  Ethics Committee, and his staff, led the way for Ethics Committee  members, with about 80 privately-funded trips at a cost of  $245,000 during the five and a half year period, according to the  study.</p>
<p>   ''Is there any reason to believe that Representative Berman  thinks that the 80 or so trips he and his staff took were  improperly funded and should not be approved in the future by the  Ethics Committee?'' Wertheimer said. ''Given his own past travel  record, is there any reason to believe that Representative Berman  is going to be prepared to crack down on his colleagues' trips in  the future?'' Wertheimer added.</p>
<p>   ''The same concerns hold true for other members of the House  Ethics Committee, who, with their staffs, have spent large sums  on privately-funded travel according to the CPI study,''  Wertheimer stated.</p>
<p>   In addition to Chairman ''Doc'' Hastings (R-Wash.) and his  staff, who spent $70,000 on privately-funded trips during the  period, the top spenders, including staff, were Representatives  Gene Green (D-Texas), $198,000; Stephanie Tubbs Jones (D-Ohio),  $130,000; Mike Doyle (D-Pa.) 95,000; Tom Cole (R-Okla.), $78,000  and Judy Biggert (R-Ill.), $60,000. </p>
<p>   According to the CPI study of House Ethics Committee members,  ''The Democratic members took in excess of 140 trips--more than  their Republican counterparts by a 4-to-1 margin. According to  disclosure forms, the travel expenses of Democrats and their  staffers also accounted for more than $690,000, roughly 70  percent of sponsors' spending.''</p>
<p>   The CPI study found that members of Congress and their staff,  as a whole, received nearly $50 million in privately-funded  travel during the period, including at least 200 privately-funded  trips to Paris, 150 to Hawaii and 140 to Italy.</p>
<p>   In a letter sent to members of the House Ethics Committee on  June 12, 2006, five reform groups expressed their strong  opposition to the creation of a pre-approval process by the House  Ethics Committee for privately-funded travel for Members.</p>
<p>   The groups include the Campaign Legal Center, Democracy 21,  the League of Women Voters, Public Citizen and U.S. PIRG. The  groups stated in the letter:</p>
<p>   We strongly oppose the use of pre-approval by the House Ethics  Committee to legitimize privately-funded travel for two basic  reasons.</p>
<p>   First, pre-approval by the House Ethics Committee of  privately-funded trips will not stop the widespread abuses that  have occurred in the House as a result of private groups paying  for trips by Members whose decisions and votes they are trying to  influence. At the same time, it will reduce a Member's own  accountability for taking privately-funded trips.</p>
<p>   Second, the House Ethics Committee has no public credibility.  The Committee has failed to enforce even the limited existing  House ethics rules governing travel, failed to investigate the  Jack Abramoff lobbying scandals and failed to even function  during most of this Congress.</p>
<p>   There is no reason for the public to have any confidence in  decisions by the House Ethics Committee about what is acceptable  privately-funded travel, even if such a process was an effective  way to end travel abuses by Members, which it is not.</p>
<p>   If members of Congress are traveling on official business for  public purposes, it is the public that should pay for such trips,  not private interests.</p>
<p>   The five reform groups further stated in their June 12 letter:</p>
<p>   There is no reason to believe that a system of pre-approval of  privately-funded trips for Members is going to stop vacation-type  trips for Members to Paris, Hawaii, Italy and the like.</p>
<p>   There is no reason to believe that a system of pre-approval of  privately-funded trips for Members is going to stop private  interests from using privately-funded trips to gain special  access to and influence with Members, and in particular with the  most powerful members of the House.
