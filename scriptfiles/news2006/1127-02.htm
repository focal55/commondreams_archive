<p>WASHINGTON - November 27 - Earlier today, Citizens  for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) asked the  Department of Justice (DOJ) to investigate whether Speaker Dennis  Hastert (R-Ill.) violated the law by inserting an earmark into  the 2005 Highway Bill that earned him a 500 percent profit on a  lucrative land deal.</p>
<p>   As reported in the Chicago Tribune, in August 2002, Hastert  purchased 179 acres of land, inaccessible by road, in Kendall  County, Ill. for $925,000 or $5,200 per acre. Then, in February  2004, Hastert formed a real estate trust with two other land  buyers and purchased 69 acres of land adjacent to the original  parcel at a cost of $1,033,000 or $15,000 per acre. The trust's  69 acres was then joined with 69 acres of Hastert's land. </p>
<p>   The land purchased by the trust was more valuable than  Hastert's property because it was accessible by road.</p>
<p>   In the summer of 2005, the Federal Highway Bill was enacted  containing a $207 million earmark inserted by Hastert for  construction of the Prairie Parkway. While the earmark was  sufficient only to build about one-third of the entire 36 mile  parkway, the language of the legislation mandated that  construction take place on the portion of the parkway nearest to  Hastert's property. </p>
<p>   As reported in The New Republic, four months after the bill  was signed into law, the trust's 138 acres was sold to a  developer for $4,989,000 or $36,152 an acre. The partners  apportioned the proceeds of the sale according to the acreage  each had contributed. Thus, Hastert was credited with 62 percent  ownership on the supposition that his $5,200 per acre land was  equal in value to the partnership's $15,000 per acre land with  the result that he received $3,118,000 of the proceeds. While  Hastert's partners each made a 144 percent profit on their  investment, Hastert's profit was 500 percent of his original  investment. </p>
<p>   Melanie Sloan, CREW's executive director, stated, &quot;Speaker  Hastert's use of the earmarking process to increase his own  property value is an egregious abuse of his legislative  authority. The Department of Justice should immediately  investigate this sweetheart deal.&quot;  </p>
<p>   Sloan continued, &quot;Congressional leaders have promised that the  first order of business in January will be to enact ethics  legislation. Any reform package must include a provision  prohibiting members from inserting earmarks for their own  personal financial benefit.&quot;</p>
<p>   The request for investigation and supporting documents are  available at CREW's Web site.</p>
<p>   Hastert was included in the watch list of CREW's September  2006 report, &quot;Beyond DeLay: The 20 most corrupt members of  Congress (and five to watch).&quot;</p>
