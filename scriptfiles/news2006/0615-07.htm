<p>LOS ANGELES - June 15 - Today we learned that the death toll of US. servicepeople in Iraq
has now reached 2,500. And today the Republican leadership of the House
of Representatives
used their control of the
rules to block an open debate on alternatives to U.S. policy in Iraq. With a majority of the people of this country wishing to change
course, the
Republicans will only permit a pro-Bush resolution to be considered.<br>
<br>
"The House leadership
talks about democracy in Iraq, but
won't allow it here," commented Leslie Cagan, National Coordinator of
UFPJ. "Our young people keep dying in a senseless war, but our elected
representatives
are denying the public a chance
to debate and change policy. The abuse of power is a travesty."
<p>Under
rules imposed by the House leadership, only 10 hours of debate will be
allowed and members will not be allowed to offer or vote on amendments. The
ploy will only allow a rubber stamp of the Bush administration
policy in Iraq. </p>
<p>Last week,
a broad coalition of peace groups, led by United for Peace and Justice
and its member groups, participated in a national call-in day to
Congress. Activists across the country called their
Representatives to support H.Res.543, which mandates an open debate on
Iraq, under rules which would allow all members to offer and vote on
alternatives to the failed Bush policy in Iraq. </p>

<p>"The House
leadership has responded to this call for meaningful dialogue with a
familiar political ploy: hastily write a resolution long on political
spin, but short on solutions and offer it up for a debate and vote.
They
did it last winter in response to Rep. Murtha (D-PA), who called for immediate withdrawal from Iraq, and they are
doing it again now. It is nothing more than an offensive publicity
stunt," said Cagan.</p>

<p>According
to The Washington Post (6/9/06), Rep. Boehner, the House Majority
Leader "told
reporters ... that the House will consider some kind of resolution ...
supporting the mission in Iraq, setting up a vote aimed at embarrassing
anti-war Democrats."</p>

<p>The
resolution relies on the Bush administration tactic of falsely equating
the quagmire in Iraq with the greater "war on terrorism," emphasizing
that terrorists "have called Iraq the central front in their war." It fails to say that the U.S. invasion and subsequent
occupation of Iraq are the primary reasons the country has become a
breeding ground for terrorism.</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
