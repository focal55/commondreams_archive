<p><SPAN class=BEX>WASHINGTON - September 28 - President Bush must put 
his words about ethanol development into action after speaking in Hoover, 
Alabama, today on the potential of home-grown ethanol to wean America off our 
dependence on oil. According to the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC), 
President Bush is right to support the development of ethanol into America's 
primary transportation fuel, but he and Congress must enact forward-thinking 
policies to bring this fuel quickly to the vehicles and pumps across the 
nation.</SPAN>
<P><SPAN class=BEX>In his February, 2006 State of the Union address, the 
president mentioned the potential of ethanol, and promised $150 million in 
research money into advanced ethanol fuels. But this is just a fraction of the 
amount authorized in last year's Energy Policy Act for research and development 
and commercialization of biofuels like ethanol.</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN class=BEX>"The president is on a forward-looking road by supporting 
these advanced fuels, but he's keeping his foot off the gas pedal when American 
farmers and families want to go full speed ahead," said Nathanael Greene, an 
NRDC senior policy analyst. "His administration and Congress need to enact 
policies that will advance these fuels quickly and affordably to move America 
beyond oil and cut global warming pollution."</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN class=BEX>According to NRDC analysis and advice from biofuel experts, 
below are the four things Washington could do now to increase the flow of 
ethanol, safely and affordably:</SPAN></P>
<UL>
<LI><B><SPAN class=BEX>Invest in a package of research, development and 
demonstration.</SPAN></B> <SPAN class=BEX>To spur the development of ethanol 
along at the proper pace and ensure that biofuels are affordable for American 
consumers, our leaders in Washington should invest about $1.1 billion between 
2006 and 2015 in biofuels development.</SPAN><BR><BR>
<LI><B><SPAN class=BEX>Offer incentives for deploying the first billion gallons 
of cellulosic biofuels.</SPAN></B> <SPAN class=BEX>To make sure that at least 1 
billion gallons of cellulosic biofuels are produced by 2015, the government 
should offer $1 billion in incentives to production facilities.</SPAN><BR><BR>
<LI><B><SPAN class=BEX>Give consumers a meaningful choice at the 
pump.</SPAN></B> <SPAN class=BEX>So American families don't just choose between 
oil and oil at the pump, the government should require that all vehicles sold by 
2015 be flex-fuel vehicles (able to use both traditional fuels and biofuels) and 
that at least one-quarter of gasoline stations have at least one pump dedicated 
to biofuels.</SPAN><BR><BR>
<LI><B><SPAN class=BEX>Raise fuel performance standards.</SPAN></B> <SPAN 
class=BEX>The administration has had six years to raise the fuel performance 
standards for vehicles sold in America, and has only submitted anemic increases 
that will not move America beyond oil. Simply by raising the fuel economy 
standard for SUVs and other light trucks like those in the Hoover, Alabama, city 
fleet, by just one mile per gallon per year over the next five years -- to 27.2 
mpg by model year 2012 -- we could save one million barrels of oil per day by 
2020. That's twice as much oil as we buy from Iraq, and would also mean more 
efficient use of ethanol fuels grown here at home.</SPAN></LI>
