<p>WASHINGTON - December 12 - The European Commission's follow-up report to its 2005 EU Strategy for Africa threatens to give political support to a flawed process leaving Africans out of the loop, international&nbsp; development&nbsp;agency ActionAid said today. <BR>
<BR>
“We recognize the importance of Europe's support in eradicating poverty in Africa but it is vital that this process is carried out in a transparent and inclusive manner," said Hussaini Abdu, Regional Governance Coordinator for Africa. <BR>
<BR>
"Squeezing a strategy flawed in process, content and context through the backdoor will only damage our continent's hopes for progress. Ownership must come back to Africa." <BR>
<BR>
ActionAid believes the strategy lacks 'real' partnership with Africa, transparency and mutual accountability - central elements for development on the continent. <BR>
<BR>
It also fails to bring credible and systematic responses to key obstacles to Africa’s development undermining formerly established partnerships.<BR>
<BR>
"It is only now, 12 months on, as an afterthought that the EC is seeking to bring both civil society groups and African governments on board," said Abdu.<BR>
<BR>
The issue has become extremely sensitive because of the lack of transparency regarding the objectives of this process, especially with regard to the implications for existing legally binding agreements such as the 2000 Cotonou agreement. <BR>
<BR>
Discord is growing within the European institutions as to the rationale behind this new Africa Strategy and is being propelled forward by outrage among African and EU civil society groups.<BR>
&nbsp; <BR>
ActionAid regrets that the EU Africa Strategy process has failed to adequately involve the very nations it is targeting and is calling on the EU to demonstrate 'real' willingness to learn from African experiences and analysis.<BR>
<BR>
It calls on the EU to strengthen institutions where such mutual Africa/EU learning and dialogue can take place as well as fostering understanding within and between African countries.<BR>
<BR>
"We now aim to carry out a consultation process between EU and African civil society partners in order to propose our own "African Strategy" towards the EU in 2008 and regain ownership of this process," said Moussa Faye, Country Director of Action Aid Senegal. <BR>
<BR>
Later today (Tuesday), the EU General Affairs and External Relations Council will approve a report assembled by the European Commission and General Secretariat of the Council on the implementation of the EU Strategy for Africa for formal approval at the EU Council meeting on 14 December in Brussels.
<P>Note to editors: <BR>
<BR>
ActionAid works in some 47 countries in the fight against poverty, helping over 14 million people a year.&nbsp; </P>
<P>ActionAid is member of CONCORD, the European confederation of relief and development NGOs. Its 21 national associations and 19 international networks represent over 1.600 NGOs, which are in turn supported by millions of people across Europe.</P>
<P>The EU Strategy for Africa adopted by the EU in 2005 is the latest strategy document on Africa to emerge from Europe. The Africa Strategy was proposed by the European Commission on 12 October 2005 and endorsed by the General Affairs and External Relations Council on 12 December 2005. <BR>
<BR>
The original proposition set out to "boost Africa’s sustainable development" with a view to holding discussions with African states and organisations about increasing stability, boosting economic growth and reducing poverty. </P>
