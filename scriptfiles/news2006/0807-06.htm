<p>WASHINGTON - August 7 - As BP shuts down eight  percent of U.S. domestic oil supply and world oil futures shoot  up by about $2 a barrel, our country is again reminded of the  vulnerability caused by our oil addiction. According to a Union  of Concerned Scientists analysis, the U.S. will spend at least an  additional $24 million on oil imports today as a result of the  price spike, sending a total of $10 million to OPEC alone.</p>
<p>   &quot;The pipeline shutdown reminds us that we need to start  kicking our oil habit,&quot; said David Friedman, research director of  UCS's Clean Vehicles Program. &quot;If all our cars and trucks on the  road today got just one extra mile per gallon, we would not even  need the 400,000 barrels per day BP has shut down. The U.S. would  spend $50 million dollars a day less on gasoline priced at $3 a  gallon.  Over the course of a year, that would be $18 billion  that could be spent strengthening our economy and creating jobs  across the country.&quot;</p>

<p>   While the U.S. Energy Department is preparing to tap into our  strategic petroleum reserves to deal with the shutdown, the  president and Congress still refuse to tap into available  technology and mandate a significant increase in fuel economy  standards for cars and trucks.  Serious fuel economy proposals  targeting increases of eight to10 mpg over the next decade have  been put forth in both the House and Senate, but Congressional  leaders have not allowed votes on this issue, even though it is  the single biggest step that can be taken to curb our oil  addiction over the next two decades.</p>
<p>   &quot;It's a disgrace that our fuel economy is lower today that it  was two decades ago,&quot; said Friedman. &quot;Our political leaders  should say 'enough is enough' and raise fuel economy standards  now.&quot;</p>
