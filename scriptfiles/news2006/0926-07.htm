<p>WASHINGTON - September 26 - Paul Helmke, president  of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, issued the  following statement today regarding the passage of a House bill  regarding gun dealers:</p>
<p>   &quot;The United States House of Representatives today chose to  pass special interest legislation that benefits the law-breaking  gun pushers who make money by selling firearms that end up in the  hands of killers, muggers and thieves.  They ignored the concerns  of our nation's Mayors and law enforcement leaders who opposed  this awful bill. </p>
<p>   &quot;One must ask the question: When does this end in our country?   How many children and police officers must die before our elected  members of Congress stop doing the bidding of the gun lobby?   Today in Pennsylvania, the families of the victims of gun  violence drove for hours to get to the state Capitol to ask for  help.  In New York, Detroit, Chicago, Denver, Seattle, my home  city of Fort Wayne, Ind., and cities all over America, the people  want their leaders to get the illegal guns off the streets.  </p>
<p>   &quot;In Washington, D.C., instead of listening to all of those  voices, a loud message was sent to the gun traffickers:  Keep the  guns coming. That's a frightening message.&quot;</p>
