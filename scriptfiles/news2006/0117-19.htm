<p>WASHINGTON  - January 17 - AFL-CIO Executive Vice President Linda Chavez-Thompson called on U.S. Senator Arlen Specter to put workers&rsquo; interest before big business when addressing our nation&rsquo;s broken immigration system. &ldquo;As you begin to tackle immigration reform, we urge you to work toward a system that protects and guarantees the rights of all workers, both native and foreign born, and that guarantees the safety of our nation, without compromising our fundamental civil rights and civil liberties,&rdquo; explained Chavez-Thompson. 
<P>In a letter to Senator Specter, Chavez-Thompson calls for: 1) the legalization of undocumented workers already living in the U.S. and contributing to their communities through taxes; 2) uniform enforcement of workplace standards to eliminate employer incentives for immigrant exploitation; and 3) skepticism towards a massive expansion of inherently flawed guestworker programs.</P><P>&ldquo;The abuses suffered by workers in the Bracero program, which ran from 1942 to 1964, are well documented and indisputable, as are the problems suffered by their modern day counterparts in H-1B and H-2B industries,&rdquo; explained Chavez-Thompson. </P><P>In her landmark statement regarding guestworker programs, Chavez-Thompson declares that there are better -- and far more moral -- solutions available than the massive expansion of temporary workers programs that serve only to provide employers with a steady stream of vulnerable workers they may exploit for commercial gain. &ldquo;If employers can demonstrate a real need for foreign workers, those workers should be welcomed into our labor markets with the same rights as any U.S. worker, and with no ties to a particular employer,&rdquo; Chavez-Thompson said. </P><P>Senator Arlen Specter (R-Pa) Chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee that is supposed to take up immigration reform this month.</P><P align=left>For a copy of the letter from the AFL-CIO to Senator Specter, please call 202-637-5018.</P>
