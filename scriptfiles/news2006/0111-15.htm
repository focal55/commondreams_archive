<p>WASHINGTON - January 11 - For the first time since the air wars over the President's Supreme Court nominees began in July of last year, progressive groups now command a lead in total TV spending on a nominee: they have spent just over $700,000 on five spots criticizing Judge Alito, while the lone conservative group running national advertising, Progress for America, has spent just under $600,000 airing four spots defending the President's nominee.  In total, the groups have so far spent $1.3 million on the Alito nomination, with the most intense round of advertising likely to coincide with Judge Alito's confirmation hearings, which began this past Monday. Advertising in the past week -- $650,000 -- equaled the amount spent in the two months prior.  The data comes from new statistics released by the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law and the Justice at Stake Campaign, complete through Jan. 8.</p>
<p>   "Now is the time to focus the public's attention on the nomination and what it means for the future of our country," said Deborah Goldberg, director of the Democracy Program at the Brennan Center for Justice.  "The TV advertising data shows that both sides see high stakes in the confirmation of a replacement for Justice O'Connor."</p>
<p>   The tone and content of the latest ads pull no punches.    IndependentCourt.org, a who's-who of progressive advocacy groups leading the campaign against Judge Alito, argues in one commercial that "Alito even voted to uphold the strip-search of a ten-year-old-girl." Progress for America, the lone group running national advertising in support of Judge Alito, says in its latest ad: "Everyday, liberals make up a steady drip of attacks against Judge Samuel Alito." </p>
<p>   "Now that the hearings have begun, interest groups seeking to influence the national debate over Judge Alito will have to react to what’s happening in the Senate Judiciary Committee," said Bert Brandenburg, executive director of the Justice at Stake Campaign. "They haven't emptied their war chests, and they'll be looking carefully for opportunities based on Judge Alito's answers to the Senators’ questions."</p>
<p>   The data for the project is gathered by TNS-Media Intelligence/CMAG, which tracks the nation's top 100 broadcast markets and national cable advertising and provides estimates on the cost of each TV spot.  Data and previous releases, as well as storyboards and streaming video of ads available to date, are available at <a href="http://releases.usnewswire.com/redir.asp?ReleaseID=59139&Link=http://www.brennancenter.org">http://www.brennancenter.org</a> and <a href="http://releases.usnewswire.com/redir.asp?ReleaseID=59139&Link=http://www.justiceatstake.org">http://www.justiceatstake.org</a>. </p>
