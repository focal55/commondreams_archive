<p>WASHINGTON - May 23 - Amnesty  International USA (AIUSA) today highlighted the role of private  military contractors in the U.S. government's current system for  outsourcing key military detention, security and intelligence  operations. Such outsourcing fuels serious human rights  violations and undermines accountability, the organization stated  at the release of its 2006 Annual Report on the status of human  rights in 150 countries. </p>
<p>   &quot;The United States has become a world leader in avoiding human  rights accountability; a case in point is the reliance of the  United States government on private military contractors, which  has helped create virtually rules-free zones sanctioned with the  American flag and fire power,&quot; said Larry Cox, who became AIUSA's  executive director May 1. &quot;Business outsourcing may increase  efficiency, but war outsourcing may be facilitating impunity.  Contractors' illegal behavior and the reluctance of the U.S.  government to bring them to justice are further tarnishing the  United States' reputation abroad, hurting the image of American  troops and contributing to anti-American sentiment. These results  are a distressing return on the U.S. taxpayers' billion-dollar- plus investment and undermine what remains of U.S. moral  authority abroad.&quot;</p>
<p>   In the rush to war and with little notice, the U.S. government  has outsourced billions of dollars in contracts to private  military contractors, leaving to civilians some of the most  essential and sensitive functions in the war, including  protecting supply convoys, translating during interrogations and  conducting interrogations. Despite the weak requirements for  reporting crimes, allegations have surfaced implicating civilians  working for the U.S. government in mistreatment of Iraqi and  Afghan civilians, including hundreds of incidents of shootings at  Iraqi civilians, several deaths in custody and involvement in the  Abu Ghraib torture scandal. </p>
<p>   Major General George Fay's report on detainee abuse at Abu  Ghraib detailed the involvement of two private military companies  -- Arlington, Va.-based CACI (NYSE: CAI) and BTG, a subsidiary of  San Diego-based Titan Corporation (NYSE: TTN) -- at that  notorious prison facility. Titan, under an INSCOM contract with a  current ceiling of approximately $650 million, has provided  hundreds of linguists. CACI provided interrogators and other  intelligence-related personnel under a contract with the National  Business Center of the Interior beginning in September 2003. An  Army Inspector General's report found that 35 percent of CACI's  Iraqi interrogators had no &quot;formal training in military  interrogation policies and techniques,&quot; let alone training in the  standards of international law.</p>
<p>   Currently the contractors operate in a virtually rules-free  zone; they are exempt from Iraqi law per a Coalition Provisional  Authority order and they fall outside the military chain of  command. Of the 20 known cases of alleged misconduct by civilians  in the war on terror that were forwarded by the Pentagon and CIA  to the U.S. Department of Justice for investigation, DOJ has  dismissed two, brought one indictment, while the remaining 17 are  classified as open.</p>
<p>   AI places responsibility jointly on private military companies  and the Bush administration to overhaul the contracting system  from top to bottom to ensure safety of suspects and civilians and  investigation and prosecution when rights are violated. Private  military companies should, among other things, implement a  comprehensive human rights policy; monitor and periodically issue  public reports on its implementation; screen employees and train  them on international human rights standards; make public the  results of investigations the company may conduct into alleged  human rights abuses by employees; and disclose the terms of U.S.  government contracts with respect to human rights. Every  contractor involved in detentions or who might use force against  civilians must undergo a background check and receive human  rights and humanitarian law training. </p>
<p>   In addition, the U.S. government should create and enforce  unambiguous, transparent and consistent mechanisms for reporting  on, investigating and, when necessary, prosecuting contractors  involved in detainee abuse and/or excessive use of force against  civilians. </p>
<p>   &quot;Private military companies have tried to abandon negative  labels like 'mercenaries,'&quot; said Mila Rosenthal, Business and  Human Rights Program Director for Amnesty International USA.  &quot;They want to be considered respectable firms doing a respectable  job. If they don't want to be viewed as the scruffiest dogs of  war, they must take their human rights responsibilities  seriously. They have to understand the human rights implications  of deploying often armed personnel into war zones and ensure that  they have company-level policies to prevent and redress abuses.&quot; </p>
<p>   In recent weeks, AIUSA has contacted 14 private military  companies to urge that they improve their human rights practices.  Three companies have issued written replies, and one has met with  AIUSA in person. AIUSA has concluded that no major private  military companies currently implement adequate human rights  policies. </p>
<p>   AIUSA noted that lawmakers have also begun to call for greater  accountability in war outsourcing. Legislation sponsored by Rep.  David Price (D-NC), passed by the House last month, demands  greater transparency on the part of the intelligence community  regarding its use of private military contractors. </p>
<p>   AIUSA's criticism of private military contractors came at the  launch of an Annual Report that detailed the ways in which  governments worldwide, in the name of fighting terror, are  committing gross violations of human rights: mistreating  suspects, harming civilians and thereby undermining their ability  to solve some of the world's most urgent problems. </p>
