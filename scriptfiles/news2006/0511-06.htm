<p>NEW YORK  - May 11 - The American Civil Liberties Union announced today that it has received the 
support of several members of Congress in the organization's ongoing lawsuit 
challenging the National Security Agency's illegal domestic spying program. Led 
by Congressman John Conyers, (D-MI), the group of 72 legislators filed a 
friend-of-the-court brief on behalf of the ACLU.<BR>
<BR>"Today's support from so 
many leaders of our federal government shows that Americans will not tolerate 
the government snooping into their calls and emails without court approval," 
said Ann Beeson, Associate Legal Director of the ACLU. "The American people 
should be proud to be represented by lawmakers who are so determined to uphold 
our most precious and basic values."<BR><BR>The brief signed by the congressional 
members refuted, point-by-point, the arguments of legality made by the Bush 
Administration. The legislators argue strongly that there is no evidence that 
the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act court could not be effectively 
employed in a post September 11 environment. The lawmakers also use the brief to 
vehemently state that Congress by no means gave the administration carte blanche 
to collect intelligence as Commander-in-Chief and that the program is "operating 
against the express as well as the implied will of Congress."<BR><BR>Since 2001, the 
NSA has been secretly intercepting the phone and e-mail communications of 
Americans without any judicial check and in violation of the Fourth Amendment. 
According to the ACLU, the NSA spying program directed by President Bush 
violates the free speech and privacy rights of innocent Americans. A secret 
program to monitor Americans without warrants jeopardizes the freedom of 
expression that is essential to a healthy democracy. Such a policy also 
threatens the exchange of information and ideas that countless businesses, 
journalists and lawyers depend on for their livelihood. Under the program, the 
NSA is also engaging in wholesale datamining, capturing millions of calls and 
e-mails of ordinary American residents who have done nothing wrong. Saying that 
the Bush administration's illegal spying on Americans must end, the ACLU filed 
its lawsuit against the NSA in January of this year. <BR><BR>The ACLU lawsuit was 
filed on behalf of a group of prominent journalists, scholars, attorneys and 
national nonprofit organizations (including the ACLU) who frequently communicate 
by phone and e-mail with people in the Middle East. Because of the nature of 
their calls and e-mails, they believe the program is disrupting their ability to 
talk with sources, locate witnesses, conduct scholarship and engage in advocacy. 
The spying program has sparked national and international furor and has been 
condemned by lawmakers across the political spectrum. <P></P>
<P>The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in the Eastern District of 
Michigan, seeks a court order declaring that the NSA spying is illegal and 
ordering its immediate and permanent halt. Attorneys in the case are Ann Beeson, 
Jameel Jaffer and Melissa Goodman of the national ACLU, and Michael Steinberg of 
the ACLU of Michigan. The Court will hear arguments on the legality of the 
program on June 12. <BR><BR>U.S. Representatives who signed on to the brief with 
Conyers include: Neil Abercrombie, HI; Gary Ackerman, NY; Brian Baird, WA; Tammy 
Baldwin, WI; Howard Berman, CA; Shelley Berkley, NV; Earl Blumenauer, OR; Rick 
Boucher, VA; Corrine Brown, FL; Michael Capuano, MA; Julia Carson, IN; William 
Lacy Clay, MO; Artur Davis, AL; Peter DeFazio, OR; Diana DeGette, CO; William

CA; Robert Wexler, FL; Lynn Woolsey, CA; David Wu, OR; and Albert Russell Wynn, 
MD.<BR><BR>"We applaud those lawmakers who have joined us in this case calling for 
an end to the illegal wiretapping program," said Caroline Fredrickson, Director 
of the ACLU Washington Legislative Office. "We hope that Congress will take the 
brief as a sign that oversight of this operation remains alarmingly absent. We 
urge lawmakers to bring the truth to light and help restore the rule of 
law."<BR><BR>Business and civil rights leaders including the National Association 
for the Advancement of Colored People and Michael Kieschnick, President and 
co-founder of Working Assets Funding Services Inc. also filed friend-of-the 
court briefs on behalf of the ACLU in the legal battle against NSA wiretapping 
in April of this year.<BR><BR>For more information on the lawsuit, including the
