<p>SAN FRANCISCO, California - January 6 - The Sierra Club today announced the premiere of a new half-hour television series with award-winning filmmaker Robert Greenwald ("Outfoxed," "Wal-Mart: The High Cost of Low Price") on Link TV on Thursday, January 12, 2006.

<p>"Sierra Club Chronicles," a monthly series produced by Greenwald’s Brave New Films in association with Sierra Club Productions, and hosted by Daryl Hannah, captures seven David vs. Goliath stories: the dramatic efforts of committed individuals across the country working to protect the health of their environment and communities.

<p>The first of seven Chronicles episodes is "9/11 Forgotten Heroes." Emergency medical crews, firefighters and construction workers answered the call to Ground Zero -- assured that the air was safe. But while our heroes came to the nation’s rescue, the government left them at risk. Years later, they not only suffer from health problems due to the contamination at Ground Zero, they suffer the indignity of having to fight the government for health benefits.  "9/11 Forgotten Heroes" follows four of these first responders as they travel from NYC to DC seeking justice, in the form of the Walsh Amendment, which would restore $125 million dollars in aid.

<p>The second episode, "The Day the Water Died," will visit the still economically and emotionally afflicted fishing town of Cordova, Alaska 16 years after the Exxon Valdez disaster, where the citizens are fighting to hold Exxon to their word in a year of record profits.  This episode is timed to coincide with actions around the Exxpose Exxon campaign. Summaries of all seven episodes are available at <a href="http://www.sierraclubtv.org">www.sierraclubtv.org</a>.

<p>"All over America, there are inspirational, real life stories of women and men defending their homes, health and families from environmental hazards and threats," explained Carl Pope, Executive Director of the Sierra Club.

<p>"Sierra Club Chronicles" is part of a growing trend of progressive organizations creating their own media venues and harnessing new technology for grassroots outreach and organizing. The series will air together with the ACLU's original half-hour program, "Freedom Files." Beyond the initial television broadcast, DVDs and videos of "Sierra Club Chronicles" will be available for consumers, educators, and other organizations. In addition, the episodes will be available for viewing online or downloading as video podcasts at www.sierraclubtv.org and Google video.  Added Pope, "We are betting that the same people who are using the newest tools to access multimedia are the same people who are hungry for the inspiring stories not found on the major networks.  Now it's easy for them to go out and find the content that speaks to them and watch it on their laptop or i-Pod."

<p>Sierra Club volunteers and allies will also be hosting house parties to view the episodes and encourage viewers to take action on the issues. The Sierra Club had tremendous success with home-based screenings of its film Oil on Ice when volunteers organized over 1,800 house parties to show the documentary about drilling in Alaska's National Wildlife Refuge. Recently, Greenwald’s film
"Wal-Mart: The High Cost of Low Price" also experienced tremendous success as an organizing and outreach tool, with grassroots house parties across the country.

<p>"It's exciting to have Brave New Films, the Sierra Club and the ACLU all working together to get progressive voices on the airwaves," said Robert Greenwald, Executive Producer. "This is about telling human stories behind the headline, behind the study, behind the policy paper--and then helping people take action to create change."

<p>One new episode will premiere the second Thursday of each month at 8:30 PM Eastern and Pacific through July 2006. Link TV is on DirecTV channel 375 and Dish Network channel 9410.  Emmy Award winner Molly O'Brien co-executive produces and Richard Ray Pérez serves as director and supervising producer.  Kim Haddow and Adrienne Bramhall oversee the production for Sierra Club.

<p>"Sierra Club Chronicles" is made possible by the generous support of the Ford Foundation.
