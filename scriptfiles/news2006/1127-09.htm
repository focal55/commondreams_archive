<p>WASHINGTON - November 27 - “Preservation Pennsylvania today announced that Gettysburg National Military Park ranks at the top of its 2006 Pennsylvania At Risk list because of a casino proposed within cannon range of the park.  Constructing and marketing a casino at Gettysburg would detract from and conflict with its unique character. 
<p>Gettysburg is a family-friendly town where children and adults learn about a time in our history that shaped who we are as a nation today.  Walking through town and on the fields of sacrifice, visitors gain insights into what those events meant then, and what they mean to us today.  

<p>Today, Gettysburg is, and should remain, a place to contemplate the American spirit, and to hear President Abraham Lincoln’s challenge to us—the living—that those who sacrifice for our country do not do so in vain.  We ask the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board to protect Gettysburg, a place important to all Americans, and deny this ill-advised application to build a casino at Gettysburg.”
