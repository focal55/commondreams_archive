<p>Unfortunately, some of the leaders of the party aren't mustering much energy for the battle.

<p>Harry Reid, the Senate Minority Leader, says, "I always would rather dance than fight." And he says he'd probably support Antonin Scalia for chief justice, remarking, "This is one smart guy."

<p>Such a comment should not come as a total surprise.

<p>After all, Reid is pro-war, anti-choice, weak on civil liberties, and a buddy of Bush's.

<p>But that underlines the question, Why in the world did the Dems choose him as their leader?

<p>The problem is much bigger than the slender Reid. It's a widely shared attitude problem among Senate Democrats (only Robert Byrd seems to be consistently making noise).

<p>Senator Pat Leahy, supposedly a leading liberal, says he likes Alberto Gonzales and calls him a "uniting figure."

<p>The guy who drafted the pro-torture language is a uniting figure?

<p>Democratic Senators should not be rallying behind this pick. They should be trying to block it.

<p>They should not be signaling passivity. They should be sending unmistakable signs of aggressiveness.

<p>And in that spirit, where is the Democratic Senator who will join House colleagues like John Conyers and question the Ohio tally?

<p>The last thing Senate Democrats need is a replay of the scene, caught on camera in Fahrenheit 911, of African American House Democrats pleading, to no avail, with their white Senate colleagues for support on the crucial issue of the right to vote.

<p>Now is not the time for chumminess with the likes of Scalia, Gonzales, and Bush. It's the time for defiance.
