<p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Careful readers of newspapers will, almost every day, happen upon the latest disturbing news concerning the activities of the Bush administration. There is a variety of these items - the use of the Labor Department to help businesses cut the wages for ordinary workers, for example, or the relentless ratcheting up of the national debt, or a duck-hunting trip between vice president Cheney and Supreme Court justice Scalia while the Energy Task Force case is pending before the Supreme Court, a case that is very dear to Cheney and central to our system of open government. These scandalous items sometimes get a bit of play - such as the Bush administration's eagerness to cut short the 9/11 investigation so as to prevent the truth about 9/11 from damaging his election prospects. Or they may not get much notice - such as Bush's alacrity in turning over American government to polluters.
 </FONT><p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">     	Recently a small item ran in the Charlotte (N.C.) Observer (from the Washington Post) that began: "The nation's manufacturers have a new political consultant helping them to overcome all those nettlesome government regulations protecting the environnment. The consultant's name: Envrionmental Protection Agency Administrator Mike Leavitt." It seems the National Association of Manufacturers was trumpeting an upcoming speech by Leavitt to its group - called "Environmental Issues 2004: How to Get Results in an Election Year...." In other words, the administrator of the agency charged with overseeing these companies was giving them advice on how to get around environmental regulations.
  </FONT><p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">   	Does that spark any sense of outrage? Perhaps it may for some readers. But it's small potatoes when compared to the patterns of the Bush administration. Regarding the environment alone, Bush has filled several senior environment-related jobs with pro-business advocates who have worked on behalf of various industries in battles over environmental policies with the federal government. He has turned energy policy over to the energy industry, health care policy to the health care industry, media policy to advocates of giant media conglomerates, and he has stacked the defense policy board with members of the defense industry. In instance after instance, Bush has turned our government into a Ponzi-like scheme in which businesses are "regulated" by the people who have a direct stake in the process; then these same "regulators," once they leave public office, are often hired for millions of dollars by the regulated companies. It is essentially a selling of the American government to private interests.
  </FONT><p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">    	Bush's people claim they dislike government - but actually the reverse is true. They love government, as long as they can use it to line their own pockets. Many sensible Republicans have a genuine distrust of burdensome regulations - but one thing that has characterized Bush and his cronies is the unmitigated audacity with which they have used government as a personal enrichment service. Bush claims to love democracy; he led the nation to war over it. Yet his policies are ultimately anti-democratic, the very antithesis of a government for and by the people.
   </FONT><p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">   	If one believes news accounts, Bush may not even be aware of some of his policies. The New Yorker recently ran an article that described him  as having an astonishing lack of curiousity about newspaper reports. According to the article, he scans headlines but gets his morning news briefings from Laura. He himself has said he relies on his aides to give him his news.
    </FONT><p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">   	Imagine - the leader of the most powerful country in the world willingly allowing himself to be screened from news reports. Does he even know his EPA administrator is giving advice to interest groups that the EPA is supposed to regulate? Does he know his administration is helping businesses cut overtime pay for millions workers - many of whom are his own supporters?
	  </FONT><p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">    The same New Yorker article explained the Bush administration's obsession with secrecy. This paranoid, Nixonian working of government disregards the simple fact that these are public employees - paid by us - to create public policy that is supposedly in the public interest.
	  </FONT><p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">   One mantra we hear from Republicans, when $100,000 tax cuts for millionaires are pointed out, is that, "Hey, it's OUR money." Okay. But hey, "It's OUR government." It is time that the people demand that our government not be used as a vehicle for giveaways to corporations and to Bush contributors, to demand that it not be used to give away the basic protections of law.
	      </FONT><p><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">   One complaint from many news observers is that the mainstream media have been too soft on Bush - to compliant in their reporting about Bush's environmental, economic and foreign policies that, if given a full airing, would probably alienate even most of his supporters. However, the rules of objective journalism require "balance," so it is probably unreasonable to expect the Post's article about Leavitt to contain the outrage it deserves. In many cases, the press has put the information out there, but there is another step in the process - it is up to voters to smell between the lines. They must demand to take back the government for the people; it is the only way to stop the daily disturbing news coming from the Bush administration.
