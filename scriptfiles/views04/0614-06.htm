<p>Ray Charles, the superb African American musician who died on June 10, got 
over in more ways than one.

<p>He appealed to Americans of all ages and backgrounds.  For five decades, 
they enjoyed Charles' music.

<p>He expressed his people's efforts to transcend the racial lines of America, 
a struggle recognized around the world.  Credit should partly go to Charles 
for this global recognition.

<p>Without being didactic, he created a unique sound and style against the 
backdrop of America's inhumanity towards blacks.  That is one half of the 
nation's "original sin," with the other half being the theft of the original 
occupants' land and their removal.

<p>Charles was a distinctive voice in a nation with African roots from colonial 
days.  For the past 50 years, he helped to define the cultural fabric of 
America.

<p>Case in point is Charles' lyrics that have become part of the national 
lexicon.  One of many examples is "Hit the road, Jack."

<p>In ways big and small, Charles' music speaks to the process of  liberation 
from oppression, blacks in particular but everybody in general.  Crucially, 
a watershed mark in the former struggle was the Second American Revolution, 
better known as the U.S. Civil War.

<p>On that note, Charles' getting over was about more than boosting the bottom 
line for this or that record company or film studio.  His originality and 
vitality flowed from the legacy of crossing over when slavery was the rule 
in the South.

<p>When enslaved African Americans crossed over the Ohio River, they found 
freedom on the other side.  Their descendants in those riverbank towns 
endured the pains of that unfinished U.S. revolution.

<p>Toni Morrison, winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature, dramatized some of 
that time period in Sula, a wonderful novel.  In it, the water of the river 
brought life and death to some heirs of America's class and racial history.

<p>Crossover appeal is a buzz term coined to describe the white majority's 
attraction to the art of racial minorities in America.  Crossing over from 
subjugation in slavery to its opposite across the River Jordan of bible days 
is anything but rhetorical buzz.

<p>That experience ran a red line through Charles' songs based in black 
spirituals.  On top of that, he sang about life in his country as major 
social changes unfolded during the Cold War era.

<p>People who had formerly looked to the Hand of God for guidance were being 
drawn increasingly to the Invisible Hand, the supposed beacon of the free 
world in conflict with godless communism.  With grace, Charles articulated 
this tension between the sacred and the secular.

<p>Drawing on blacks' freedom journey for centuries in America, he expressed 
what many people's lived experience was in the last half of the 20th century 
as a bridge to what can and may turn out better in their lives.  That 
yearning for a more just world is the lot of working people generally on the 
job under the stone cold gazes of their bosses.

<p>Accordingly, Charles' songs touched folks of all skin colors, striking a 
chord "come run or come shine." Thank you, Ray Charles.
