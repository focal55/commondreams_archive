<p>That's how one avoids preaching to the choir. When the doings of government become transparent, it no longer takes a preacher or a choir to discern the notes of truth.

<p>Teaching everyone to sing is beyond universal disgust at photographs of Iraqi prisoner abuse. It is creating the consciousness of knowing that we have a president who continues to assert the right to wage a permanent worldwide war. (Though as a result of these photos, the war over the hearts and minds of the Iraqi populace and the Arab-Muslim world is flat-out over.)

<p>Teaching everyone to sing is beyond knowing that this president, via the "War on Terror," has a voracious appetite for imposing "peace and democracy" across the globe. In this war, secrecy, deceit and fear are paramount, particularly when passing laws (USA Patriot Act) that usurp civil and human rights. This includes policies that permit the extralegal (disappearances) and indefinite detention, without charges, of "suspects,” both at home and abroad. Under this administration, "presumption of innocence" is history. All of this is contrary to the Geneva Convention and is beyond humiliating prisoner abuse. It's true that this abuse is "un-American." Yet it's not a public relations problem or an aberration but the direct result of U.S. policies that have created secret prisons and nebulous legal status for prisoners, outside of both domestic and international jurisprudence. As such, who is to be held accountable? The one person responsible for these policies, or the abusers?

<p>Teaching everyone to sing would mean that everyone would come to realize that this administration is asserting the right to absolute, unlimited and unchecked power -- all concentrated in the hands of one man. If he had actually shown extraordinary wisdom in regard to Iraq and the Middle East (something he is credited with having post-9/11), one might even be tempted to root him on.

<p>Yet we've seen quite the opposite. His bullying and blackmailing of allies in his rush to war, based on contrived reasons, have clearly exposed his effort as fraudulent. Additionally, his war policies are dependent upon demanding that "coalition partners" exempt the United States from the International War Crimes Tribunal (now we know why). All indications point to a man who is being manipulated -- who is delusional at best, convinced that he's been tapped by "The Father" upstairs to "wage war against evil."

<p>(Note the media censorship regarding the war itself and the prisoner abuse issue going back to 2001 as reported by Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch. Also note how Congress was frozen out by the Pentagon's Taguba report.)

<p>Teaching everyone to sing, or better put, permitting everyone to sing, means not simply handing over a blank check to the president's challenger, presumably Democratic nominee Sen. John Kerry. If President Bush is thumped at the polls -- as the result of the repudiation of his war policies -- then Kerry can neither be permitted to inherit absolute power, nor to exercise it.

<p>That's what teaching everyone to sing is all about: It's about recognizing that all power is derived from "We the people," and that ultimately, it is the politicians who make social contracts with us to be able to govern. Normally, that contract is dependent upon trust. However, as evidenced by this administration, democracy and constitutional protections -- including free expression -- are extremely fragile, particularly when taken for granted.

<p>The lesson learned here appears to be that never again can "We the people" turn over our power to anyone based simply on trust. The first trust was broken by a Supreme Court that literally appointed the current president. The second trust broken was the failure of the opposition party to come to the defense of the Constitution and to put a check on the administration's unprecedented grab for power. The third trust broken was the administration's assertion of the right to carry on a permanent state of war -- while claiming it as the road map to peace.

<p>Teaching everyone to sing means coming to the realization that power -- like our rights -- comes not from politicians or parties, nor even from the Constitution or the U.N.'s Human Rights charter. Those rights are inalienable. We can either assert them or give them away blindly to those who continue to betray the sacred trust we place upon them. Similarly, it appears we have come to the time when we the people must demand accountability, not simply on Election Day, but every day that elected officials govern in our name.

<p>It appears it's also time for a new song.
