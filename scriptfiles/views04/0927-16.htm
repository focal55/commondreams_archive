<p>A political storm slammed into northern Haiti long
before Tropical Storm Jeanne came along. On March
20th, Interim Prime Minister Gerard Latortue flew into
Gonaives where a huge and boisterous crowd of
thousands welcomed him. During the festivities
Latortue embraced gang elements and the former
military that helped overthrow the democratic
government of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide as
"freedom fighters."  Since then, Latortue and his
government have done little to take control of Haiti's
third largest city and has allowed gang leaders like
Buteur Metayer and Wilfort Ferdinand to run it like a
private fiefdom. This has had serious consequences for
the people of Gonaives since Tropical Storm Jeanne
arrived to claim her share of Haiti's misery.

<p>The political storm took many victims as well and left
Haiti ill-prepared for the devastion brought about by
Tropical Storm Jeanne. One of its first victims was
the Civil Protection Office following a rampage led by
the "freedom fighters" against suspected Aristide
supporters. This politically benign institution had
been established in cooperation with the local
municipal government by grants provided by the United
States Agency for International Development  (USAID)
and administered through the Pan American Development
Foundation  (PADF).   PADF's own website confirms
that, PADF's emergency response and reconstruction
efforts are complemented by community training in
disaster preparedness. Mitigation training promotes
the development of civil action plans that enable
communities to identify priorities and reinforce key infrastructure. Last year, 23 local civil protection committees were formed and over 5,000 people were trained in disaster awareness, leading to safer communities." Unfortunately, with Washington, Paris and Ottawa ushering in a man-made disaster with the destruction of constitutional authority in Haiti, all of the tax dollars USAID invested in preparing for natural disasters like Tropical Storm Jeanne were wasted as well. 

<p>Tropical Storm Jeanne is exactly the type of disaster
USAID and PADF's programs were set up to manage. There
were components that monitored incoming tropical
storms and provided an advanced warning and
preparedness network designed to plan a response
BEFORE disaster struck. Plans included advising
communities in advance of approaching storms and
preparing for them by storing large supplies of
drinking water, food, medical supplies and portable
tents for those displaced from their homes. When
Tropical Storm Jeanne hit these structures no longer
existed and the trained and competent participants in
the program had long been driven out of the area after
their were offices pillaged and burned. No where was
this more evident than in Gonaives where many
associated with the Aristide government and the
Lavalas party were reportedly dragged through the
streets and burned alive. 

<p>Instead of reasserting control of the State and
rebuilding the necessary infrastructure that was
destroyed following the coup of February 29th,
Latortue followed a policy of benign neglect and
accommodation with thugs in the region that has led to
needless death and suffering in the wake of Tropical
Storm Jeanne. In all fairness, the fault does not lie exclusively with the US-installed government. The Bush administration shoulders much of the blame for the current situation with an ill-conceived regime change that has replaced what they considered a failed state with an even more failed state. 

<p>The United Nations also bears a large responsibility
for the armed gangs and elements of the former
military currently hampering relief efforts in
northern Haiti. Like Latortue's accommodation of the
gangs in Gonaives, the UN forces have stood by while
the former military has taken over several towns in
the north. The official excuse of the UN has been that
they do not have enough forces on the ground to
challenge the former military from seizing control of
the region. It seems that by the time they do have the necessary forces they will wake up to find themselves bunkmates with the very people they claim to want to keep out of power. This does not bode well for the inhabitants of Port au Prince should a natural disaster ever strike the capital to combine with the current political disaster as it has in Gonaives.

<p>In the end, the UN and Latortue are victims of their
own failed policies and ultimately the failed policy
of the Bush administration in Haiti. The ones who will
suffer the most as a result of these failures are the
very people they claim to have come to this island
nation to help. The disregard for institutions
destroyed during the latest regime change and the lack
of planning and response for natural disasters is only
a symptom of a political storm that is far from over
in Haiti- a storm that is being feed by poor political judgement. Sadly, this has resulted in more needless suffering for the people of Haiti during this latest crisis.
