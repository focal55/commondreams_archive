<p>The U.S. position facilitating Jean-Bertrand Aristide's ouster signals an ominous new period in U.S. foreign policy in which we are no longer committed to supporting democratically elected governments in this hemisphere or elsewhere. The Bush administration has lent its support to the ouster of democratically elected governments in Haiti and Venezuela, signaling a disdain not so much for their leaders but rather for the democratic institutions forged in the sacrifice of their people.

<p>Constitutional democracies are fragile instruments. Quite often, leaders who are popularly elected one year lose popularity the next. Thus, rules are put in place to preserve the system's stability. The most basic of these rules is terms of office. Those elected are expected to give up power when their terms expire; otherwise, a dictatorship arises. The governed, too, are expected to follow the rules. When the mob governs, anarchy prevails.

<p>At home in 2000, we had a president who took office although he had lost the popular vote and possibly the electoral vote. While the legitimacy of his claim to office has been rightly questioned, the rules that we have in place arguably provided for the mechanisms that led to his installation in power. Armed groups did not take to the street to prevent him from taking power or to overthrow him. Such a scenario, given our independent branches of government's use of their power, seems unthinkable.

<p>Furthermore, while individuals in foreign countries may have questioned the legitimacy of George W. Bush's ascension to power, foreign governments would have been out of line if they had meddled in our internal mechanisms of democracy.

<p>Our neighbors to our south are not so lucky. The United States has taken it upon itself to destabilize foreign democratic states by signaling its lack of support for weakened democratic leaders who do not tow the U.S. line.

<p>No one expects the United States to support the policies of foreign leaders who run counter to our interests. However, the United States is the democratic empire of the 21st century. As such, its responsibility is to support generally accepted principles of the rule of law and democratic institutions elsewhere.

<p><b>Legitimate claim
</b>
<p>We need not support Aristide or Hugo Chávez, but we must support their legitimate claim to power. Their institutions must be allowed to determine the legitimacy of their governments. To do otherwise further undermines the value of democracy, including stability and legitimacy.

<p>Either we support democracy, or we support leaders we like. Our history last century underscores the dangers of undertaking the latter path. In Nicaragua, Chile, Argentina, Brazil, Iran, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Cuba, Haiti, the Dominican Republic, Guatemala and other countries, we should have learned the lessons of the failed policy of supporting leaders who did our bidding at the cost of their peoples.

<p>In the long run we benefit (with some rare, but admittedly important, exceptions) as does the world, when we support the ability of democratically elected governments to serve out their terms. The exceptions (including Germany in the 1930s) have been when the world has stood by when the democratically elected governments -- with the acquiescence of most of its people -- have assaulted the human rights of a minority group.

<p><b>A period of lawlessness
</b>
<p>Nothing undermines the good work being done around the world by U.S. citizens in democracy-building projects as much as our own assault on the very notion of democracy -- for example, by tacitly supporting the overthrow of weakened democratic governments. It defies any sense of credibility to say that we will not support corrupt democratic governments in Venezuela and Haiti when we continue to support other corrupt democracies and dictatorships whose policies benefit our interests.

<p>The administration's policies foreshadow a somber period of lawlessness. Now more than ever, U.S. leaders have a responsibility to follow the rule of law at home and foster it abroad. The instability that will result should we fail will haunt us for generations.
