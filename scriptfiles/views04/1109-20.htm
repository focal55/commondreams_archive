<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p>&nbsp;Too many innocent people are dying in Iraq. A recent report, in
the medical journal <i>The Lancet</i>, estimates 100,000 Iraqi
civilians have been killed since the beginning of the US-led
invasion. Half of them are women and children. Almost all were
killed by coalition air strikes.</p><p>Take a minute to think about the enormity of this human cost.
Think of it as September 11, 30 times over.</p><p>Though it wildly exceeds all previous figures, <i>The Lancet</i>
estimate is credible, and perhaps even conservative, according to
independent statisticians who analysed the data and found the
report's methodologically sound.</p><p>But what if it is not? Even the lowest estimate, unsurprisingly
that of the British Foreign Secretary, places the number of
civilian deaths at 10,000. The popular website <a href="%0Ahttp://www.iraqbodycount.com/" target="
_blank">http://www.iraqbodycount.com</a> puts the figure at a
minimum of 14,000. We are still talking about four times the number
of September 11 casualties. That's eight planes and eight
towers.</p>
<p>Surely now, the governments that took us to this war and we, as
people who are happy to re-elect them, must face up to our
culpability for this carnage. We claim to hold that the lives of
civilians are sacrosanct. We assert that the fabric of humanity is
torn with every death of every innocent civilian. Indeed, that is
why terrorism sickens us.</p><p>So why do we not think of these deaths as tragic in the same way
we do those of September 11, Bali, Madrid or Beslan? For the
Iraqis, we will hold no multi-faith services, no commemorative
anniversary functions and we will give no human faces to them.
Perhaps some innocent lives are more sacrosanct than others. </p><p><font size=2>We are talking about four times the number of September 11 casualties. Eight planes and eight towers.</font></p><p>Of course, there is a crucial difference between the civilian
deaths caused by terrorism, and those caused by the US-led
coalition in Iraq. Coalition forces did not target the innocent as
terrorists do.</p><p>True, we should not lose sight of this. But we should also not
abuse it to dehumanise those we have killed, and evade the
responsibility we rightfully bear. We speak of Iraqi civilians,
even 100,000 of them, not as victims, but as collateral damage. We
did not murder them as terrorists murder their victims, because
there was no intention to kill them.</p><p>It is simply not good enough to hide our guilt in this way. Our
actions were always destined to claim thousands of civilian lives.
This was not merely probable; it was certain. We recognised that
certainty and pressed on anyway. The fact that killing innocents
was not the aim, but rather a guaranteed byproduct of our action,
does not absolve us.</p><p>Australian lawyers call this reckless murder, and once stripped
of euphemism, that is what collateral damage is. We own the
responsibility for the foreseen, likely consequences of our
actions.</p><p>Confronted with <i>The Lancet's</i> grotesque estimate, Defence
Minister Robert Hill fell back on the standard defence that Iraqis
would be better off without Saddam Hussein. This is the argument
that killing is justified where it is necessary in defence of
another.</p><p>However, on the basis of <i>The Lancet</i> estimate, it is
ridiculous to suggest that justification applies here. It took
Saddam several decades to kill 300,000 people. We have managed a
third of that in just 18 months.</p><p>But whatever the death toll, if removing Saddam was really the
goal, can we honestly say all this deadly "shock and awe" was
necessary to achieve it?</p><p>Sergeant Scott, a soldier in Iraq, clearly did not think so when
he told Britain's <i>Daily Telegraph</i>: "You could have sent two
men in to kill Saddam. Why did we have to kill so many people?" He
was speaking less than a month after the invasion began. I cannot
imagine what he would say now.</p><p>This does not mean there is moral equivalence between
al-Qaeda-style terrorism and our civilian killings in Iraq. But
does there have to be? That our actions do not meet the depravity
of terrorism does not justify them. Since when have terrorists
provided the moral standard against which we judge ourselves? Are
we really reduced to arguing that we are not as bad as them?</p><p>Our concern, as people whose governments are waging war in our
name, should be for the legitimacy of our own actions. When it
comes to our actions in Iraq, that legitimacy has been fatally
eroded. We have now run out of excuses.</p><p><i>Waleed Aly is a Melbourne lawyer and a member of the
