<p>The outcome of the March 14th Spanish elections provoked a barrage of old-fashioned Euro-bashing by right wing commentators, from Rush Limbaugh, to Ann Coulter, to Charles Krauthammer and Bill Kristol, to name just a few.  And it’s not over yet. Even though both the European Union and the incoming Spanish government have moved to ramp up their anti-terrorism efforts in response to the Madrid bombings, conservatives continue to push the wrongheaded idea that the Spanish vote was a victory for terror.

 

<p>What terrorists want most is to win, or at least to be perceived as winning.  This perception of success is invaluable to them in terms of recruitment and popular support.  Each time someone says the terrorists have won, fuel is added to the terrorist fire. If we truly want to tighten our national security, the Euro-bashing has got to stop.

 

<p>Terrorism is a form of asymmetrical warfare.  A small force engages a much larger force it can’t possibly defeat in a conventional battle.  It doesn’t win by capturing territory, but by inflicting psychological damage. The right-wing commentators fall into the terrorist trap by declaring that the results of the Spanish vote signify a win for terror. Declaring the terrorists have "won" only emboldens them. The resultant global disharmony plays into their hands: the charge that the Spanish are "cowards" is not only untrue, but highly irresponsible.

 

<p>The Spanish people, throughout their long history, have never run from terror. They have fought back, against Napoleon, against Hitler and Mussolini, against Franco. The Socialist Party has been an unerring foe of the terrorism of Basque separatists and other groups. The people of Spain have lived with terror – in the form of bombings, shootings and kidnappings – for more than thirty years.  They understand the scourge of terror and the importance of being resolute against it as well, if not better, than we do.

 

<p>After each death, they have risked their lives to protest terror by peacefully demonstrating in the streets, as they did on March 12th, eleven million strong. One of the marchers was Irene Villa, a young dancer, daughter of a postal worker, who lost two legs and part of a hand in an ETA bombing when she was thirteen. A graphic picture of her, mutilated and covered with blood, appeared the next day on the front page of every newspaper in Spain. Yet, Irene Villa, now a beautiful young woman, marched with her friends in Madrid last Friday, against terror, against terrorism, against terrorists. 

 

<p>The Spanish people did not vote to give in to terror, but rather to try a new strategy in the fight against it. They chose to form a unified policy with their natural allies, the other members of the European Union, which focuses on more than just a military approach. In other words, they chose a different route than the one mapped out by George W. Bush and José María Aznar; not a different destination.

 

<p>Continued cooperation with Spain is fundamental in our efforts against terror. We share a dubious honor: we have September 11, they have March 11. The PSOE or Socialist Party has a long history battling terror: politically; through police and intelligence work; and diplomatically, since France and other countries are involved in the Basque dispute. Since Spain was once a Muslim country, there is a basis for cultural understanding and a familiarity which we lack. Miguel Angel Moratinos, Spanish diplomat and European Union envoy to the Middle East, is eminently qualified for the role of Foreign Minister in the new government. His aggressive stance, his knowledge, and his experience with the issues and the cultures involved will be great assets to the global anti-terrorism effort.

 

<p>As for the rest of Europe following Spain’s supposed urge to bolt from the fight against terror, we already know that it simply isn’t true. How has Europe reacted to the Spanish train bombings? They have appointed an anti-terror czar who would be responsible for coordinating counter-terrorism efforts among the 15 member countries, with the goal of improving intelligence sharing among them and facilitating cross-border investigations.  

 

<p>It all sounds very similar to American Homeland Security efforts after September 11, except for the fact that it took Europe exactly ten days to put its plan into action. The first European Union meetings are taking place this week. And that’s none too soon, since the Spanish investigation already has legs in England, Holland and Belgium, as well as in Morocco.  

 

<p>Friends of the Bush White House claim to be willing to do whatever it takes to root out terror; if that is true, why would they question, downplay and discourage these efforts?  We cannot afford to continuously alienate the rest of the world as we fight terror and we most certainly cannot afford to hand the terrorists the spoils of victory by declaring them “winners”.
