<p>Following the publication of appalling photos of U.S. military 
guards torturing and 
humiliating Iraqi prisoners, and 
Seymour Hersh's devastating 
revelation in The New Yorker 
that the military knew months 
ago that such abuse is systemic, 
U.S. media outlets are all abuzz 
over a "scandal."
<p> A scandal? 
<p>	To us comfortable Americans, 
these abominable acts are on 
the level of Bill Clinton's idiotic 
sexual dalliances and such go-nowhere nonsense as "Filegate." The ugliness at Abu 
Ghraib already has been 
dubbed "Torturegate" by some 
wags. 
<p>It'll blow over.... 
	
<p>But try to put yourself in the 
mind of an average Iraqi. To 
him, our scandal is a sinister 
echo of the long, fearsome 
years under Saddam Hussein. It 
is sickening proof, to him, that 
American "values" include 
mockery of those different from 
us, a juvenile (and to Muslims, 
unholy) obsession with sexual 
hijinks, a deep lack of respect, 
and blind arrogance. 
	
<p>The Bush administration sold 
its war of choice by telling us 
we faced an imminent (yes, they 
used that word) threat of attack 
with weapons of mass destruction and a poisonous alliance between Saddam and Al-Qaida. 
That didn't pan out (though Iranian journalists have reported 
there are efforts underway to 
import "evidence" of WMD; 
stay tuned). 
	
<p>So, on to the next teleprompt: 
We're engaged in a grand enterprise to instill democracy in the 
imperially cobbled-together nation of Iraq. With a lemon-fresh 
Tide of freedom we will wash 
away the stain of Saddam. 
	
<p>Right. We've hand-picked 
"leaders" with no popular support, we've killed uncounted civilians while chasing down people enraged by the chaos and 
death we have delivered, we've 
declared majority-rule off limits, 
and we've imposed a "free market" system, putting Iraq up for 
bid to Western corporations, 
without asking the Iraqis' permission. 
	
<p>And as for our cherished, simple-minded belief that we are 
white-hats battling "evildoers," 
the photos from Abu Ghraib - 
and it's not just an isolated 
pocket of untrained hillbilly reservists; it's going on all over 
the country, and in Afghanistan 
- the Muslim world now 
has photographic proof that 
Bush's dangerous Manicheanism is a pack of lies. Whatever 
we do, we can never fix this. 
	
<p>I disagreed with Bush's war 
from the outset, but I've been 
clinging tepidly to John 
Kerry's uninspiring call to "stay 
the course." No longer. 
	
<p>We're done in Iraq. The genie 
of Arab outrage is flowing over 
the Babylonian desert and we 
will never jam it back into the 
bottle. We've lost all hope of 
winning hearts and minds. The 
longer we stay, the more we'll 
aggravate the problem, and the 
more soldiers we'll lose. 
	
<p>I've been straining to think of 
an example in which any nation 
truly welcomed invasion and occupation, in which the military 
fist, chaos, civilian deaths, and 
evildoings won hearts and 
minds. If anyone thinks of one, 
let me know (and World War II 
France doesn't count: we were 
booting the Nazi invaders out). 
	
<p>It's time to start planning an 
orderly exit and bona fide transition of power to Iraqis, under 
the watch of the United Nations. 
Yes, our reputation will suffer, 
but it has already because the 
Bush-Cheney-Rumsfeld-Wolfowitz experiment has failed, and 
there's no excuse to spill more 
blood in the administration's 
ideological petri dish. 
	
<p>Ultimately, the real solution 
- which doesn't have to entail a 
bloodbath, if the U.N. is involved - may be to let "Iraq" break 
into three nations of Kurds, 
Sunnis and Shia. The modern 
Middle East was drawn up by 
Britain and France along such 
arbitrary lines as railroads, and 
there is no moral reason to try 
to hold it together. Does any
body really believe a new, independent Iraq wouldn't collapse 
into civil war anyway? 
	
<p>What hawks never seem to 
realize is that while war is sometimes necessary, it always 
breeds inhumanity. There are 

no "evildoers" and good guys 
when bullets fly. When enemies 
threaten you, it's you or them, 
and you shrug off "collateral 
damage." And when your leaders preach that "they" are evil, 
and we have God on our side, 
anger can morph oh-so-easily 
into brutality. Think Rwanda. 
My Lai. Al-Qaida. Hitler. 
	
<p>We've lost. How many more 
must die before we admit it?
