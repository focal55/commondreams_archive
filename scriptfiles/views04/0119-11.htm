<p>If I were Coretta Scott King and the White House had called and asked me if President George W. Bush could come to Atlanta to lay a wreath on my husband's grave, I would have said, "Sure, come on down."

<p>I respect President Bush's wish to honor the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. - one of the great moral leaders of all time - just as other presidents have done. Whatever one thinks of the guy who happens to be occupying the White House right now, it's an honor when the leader of the nation acknowledges the civil- rights leader's life and work. Coretta King did the right thing by escorting Bush to her husband's tomb last week.

<p>But that's not to say that the hundreds of protesters who booed and chanted when the president showed up didn't have a point. They said they were outraged because Bush's policies - including those on Iraq, spending for social programs and affirmative action - conflict totally with what King worked for. As I told a friend who criticized the protesters, they have a right to be upset.

<p>As we observe the official Martin Luther King Jr. holiday today, many of the observances have become numbingly predictable. His exquisite "I Have a Dream" speech will be quoted endlessly, and one devotee after another will analyze the extent to which King's dream of a racially just society is at odds with reality.

<p>Fortunately, a new documentary film about King's life, which will be shown on PBS tonight, takes us beyond King's work as a civil-rights leader to his growing activism over the United States' role in the world.

<p>"Citizen King," by filmmaker Orlando Bagwell, shows how King went from leading the civil-rights movement that put an end to racial segregation in the South, turned his attention to trying to correct economic discrimination against blacks in the North, and went on to criticize the violence the United States was causing in other parts of the world in the name of the Cold War.

<p>During the last few years of his life, as the anti-war movement heated up, King started speaking out against the war in Vietnam. Because he dared to step out of the Negro preacher role and criticize American foreign policy, he was attacked by the white liberals who had supported the movement, by the press and by blacks who felt his main allegiance should be to black issues. An ally of President Lyndon Johnson on two civil- rights bills, King suddenly found himself unwelcome at the White House.

<p>But he persisted. At Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta in 1967, he said:

<p>"Don't let anybody make you think that God chose America as his divine messianic force to be a sort of policeman for the whole world. God has a way of standing before the nations with judgment and it seems that I can hear God saying to America, 'You are too arrogant. If you don't change your ways, I will rise up and break the backbone of your power, and I will place it in the hands of a nation that doesn't even know my name.'"

<p>King was talking about Vietnam. But, as this administration tries to mop up the collateral damage from the war in Iraq, a war that appears to have been waged out of arrogance and hubris rather than necessity, and as religious fanatics from Muslim countries keep us in a constant state of anxiety, King's words seem downright prophetic. The Bush administration has indeed set out to make the United States the world's policeman, but for power grabs as much as for humanitarian reasons.

<p>"One reason we made the film," Bagwell told me, "is we thought King's words would speak to what we perceive to be the dangers Americans see for themselves in the world, to how we address different parts of the world and the people who're in conflict with each other."

<p>After watching the film, I thought about the duplicity behind this recent war and about the president's new, grandiose scheme to take us to Mars, the moon and beyond, even as children here are going hungry and millions are without jobs and health care. Let Bush lay a wreath on King's grave, I said. But let the protesters scream, too.
