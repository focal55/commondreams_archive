<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p>Maybe I'm just dumb or hopelessly naive, but I don't understand how it can be that all the folks who messed up foreign policy in the first Bush administration, especially over Iraq, are being either promoted or kept in place. The ones who had the intelligence and courage to oppose what was happening are being given the boot. 
<p> There was some hope that once past the election President George W. Bush would hold those who made mistakes accountable. Fat chance. Secretary of State Colin Powell, who warned Bush that if he broke Iraq he would own it, is out. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, who told Bush that Iraq would be a cakewalk and democracy would flourish, is still in.<p> Condoleezza Rice, who, as national security adviser should have made certain that the prescient State Department reports on the postwar period were paid attention to but did not, has been promoted to secretary of state. And her deputy, Stephen Hadley, whose specific job it was to plan for the postwar period, is the new national security adviser. <p> The CIA, which certainly made its share of mistakes but also warned that some of the intelligence the president's advisers were using was soft at best, unreliable at worst, is being pilloried. Its employees are being warned "to support the administration and its policies in our work" or get out. <p> The most egregious case is at the Pentagon. Rumsfeld failed to anticipate the problems of post-war Iraq (although he was warned of the problems). He allowed his deputy, Paul Wolfowitz, to rely on the analysis of Ahmed Chalabi, who had not been in Iraq in decades and was considered untrustworthy by the CIA. He claimed he could ignore the Geneva Conventions when it came to treating certain prisoners, actions that led to the abuses at the Abu Ghraib prison.<p> And, perhaps worst of all, he ignored the advice of his own generals who told him he would need considerably more troops in Iraq to stabilize it after the war. Rumsfeld should have been fired months ago, but now he is staying on to stabilize the situation in Iraq. And all his neoconservative appointees are still there and in line for promotions.<p> What's going on here, folks, is that loyalty to the president is being rewarded above all other values, including competent performance. This does not bode well for the future. The officials being promoted are the ones who agree with Bush's worldview, or, rather, convinced him of their worldview: a strong America exerting its righteous influence to promote our values of democracy and free markets. <p> There's nothing wrong with saying the world would be better off with more democracy. Thomas Jefferson predicted what he and the founders had started would spread in the years to come, to some quickly, to others more slowly. But that's not the issue here. The issue is about competence, about how you accomplish the goal, about accountability. <p> The question going forward will be whether Rice believes Bush has bitten off enough for the moment and must consolidate what he has done or whether she will lead an even more aggressive foreign policy. That is, will the United States be so tied down by its commitment to Iraq that stabilizing that nation will be enough to occupy the new Bush team? U.S. forces are spread so thinly now that most observers don't believe the administration can make major military commitments even if it wanted to. <p> Or will Bush and Rice, so certain they are right - and apparently convinced of how well they are doing - continue to plunge ahead with new, aggressive foreign policy? <p> The answer will go a ways toward determining what type of nation and what type of world we will be living in.
