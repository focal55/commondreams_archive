<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->Ws may not be running the country. But between the W-in-chief in the White House, Tom Wolfe and Bob Woodward, they're doing a great job making it up as they go along.

<p>Everyone is familiar with the president's red-hot fictions. Pick up any morning paper and there they are, in installments as copious as Dickens' serialized novels. Wolfe's and Woodward's fictions are less frequent but almost as popular. No matter what the critics say, whatever they write is a best-seller. Whatever its quality, their work is slam-proof, just like the president's, and for the same reasons: They have a perfect ear for what Americans want to hear and whom they like to judge. Call it the NASCAR impulse. Readers sit in their armchairs, in turn identifying with and disparaging the action as it unfolds, feeling as much a part of it as absolvingly apart from it. Not only are the stories between the covers entertaining, but so is the act of reading them. Wolfe and Woodward books are cultural events as few printed bricks ever are anymore. To read them is to be in the know.

<p>Too bad what amounts to the known has about as much relationship with the truth as a scripted reality show.

<p>Every year or so Woodward picks a subject inside Washington -- George W. Bush's war games, Alan Greenspan's monopoly games, Bill Clinton's closets, the CIA's skeletons -- and gets on with the business of detailing it with voyeuristic abandon. The books are strictly reported but read like novels, because at heart they're dead-on representations of government's fictions about itself. Woodward doesn't just take readers on the inside. He makes them feel like they're part of the action, that they have a stake in the plot, which is why his subjects are so eager to let him in on things. They'll trade the appearance of being unraveled for the glory of being mythologized. It's not journalism. It's publicity. President Bush owes his "war president" image almost entirely to Woodward's "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0743244613/commondreams-20/ref=nosim" target="_new"><em>Bush at War</em></a>" from two years ago and to "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/074325547X/commondreams-20/ref=nosim" target="_new"><em>Plan of Attack</em></a>" this year, books that put readers in the White House situation room with the president, provided readers were willing to play along as cheerleaders. Without that Hemingwayesque romance to fabricate his image with, Bush's 51 percent presidency might well have been toast.

<p>Every couple of years or so Tom Wolfe picks a subject anywhere outside Washington -- space cowboys, artsy snobs, Wall Street rakes, real estate gluttons -- and gets on with the business of picking it apart with voyeuristic abandon. Some of the books are nonfiction, some are fiction, but they read like novels either way. Wolfe, too, takes readers on the inside but keeps them at the remove of the critic.

<p>If Woodward's book-selling signature is the scoop, Wolfe's is the kind of satire that lets the reader feel as if he's getting back at those VIPs he could never be -- the popular kids in school, the mega-athletes in college, the super-rich financiers, the art scene's aristocrats and always, always those rich guys who seem to be rutting all the time. It's snobbery for the masses. Except that Wolfe's lethal prose often comes through as envy, jealousy, resentment. In other words, the way pretty much conservative criticism of alleged liberal debauchery often comes through.

<p>Wolfe's latest, "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0374281580/commondreams-20/ref=nosim" target="_new"><em>I Am Charlotte Simmons</em></a>," traces the fall and rise of a coed freshman at a Duke University-like college where sex, drinking and cheating are about all that goes on. Charlotte Simmons is innocent but brilliant, a mountain girl with cosmopolitan aspirations who ends up being used both by Wolfe's fictional predators and to accommodate Wolfe's moral judgments. She is the decline and depravity of college life in America. Conservatives have been pointing to "Charlotte Simmons" as proof of the damage done by "a world of unprecedented ambiguity," as David Brooks put it, where "social rules have dissolved because the morality that used to undergird them dissolved long ago."

<p>Moral dissolutions "undergird" Wall Street ethics, Congress' fraternity-like comportment, the selling of the environment, the mortgaging of the country's fiscal future and, of course, the wantonness of America's occupation in Iraq. Moral dissolution is the subplot of every Woodward book, the time-bomb in every other Bush policy. But somehow the university alone -- the last major American institution still nominally liberal, the most idealistic and probably least dissolute -- happens to be the moralists' target of choice. No surprise: Modern-day conservatism brooks no opposition, even when it's imaginary, and the three Ws are nothing if not popular fabricators of dragons. How to get the masses to buy into slaying them? With fictions like "Charlotte Simmons" and "Plan of Attack," playbooks to W's crusades.
