<p>Oh, the zeal and alacrity with which so many Western desk hawks pounced upon the horrific events at Beslan's Middle School No. 1 to defend their case, again, that the "war on terror" is right, that the enemy is among us and anybody who doesn't agree is a girlie man appeaser.

<p>They make these leaps of logic while jumping over the charred bodies of children and skipping over Russia's brutalization of Chechnya, not only to sell U.S. President George W. Bush's failed foreign policy but to call for four more years of it.

<p>"The Russian Crisis, beamed into American living rooms, not only justifies what George Bush has done to avenge and protect the United States and the world, but makes sending a message to future terrorists compelling," wrote the National Post's Diane Francis on Tuesday, positing that "voting Republican is the safest bet."

<p>The Winnipeg Sun's Charles Adler uses the massacre to trash Canada, CBC, Prime Minister Paul Martin, Liberal MP Carolyn Parrish, and critics of the Bush administration.

<p>"Is it time that Canadians looked for stronger leadership in the war on terror?" he asks. "Is it time to stop worrying about American warts, and start focusing on terrorist bullets? Or should we wait for our children to walk a mile in the shoes of the children of Beslan?"

<p>From the New York Times' David Brooks to London's Daily Mail, there's talk of a Muslim "death cult" and how, if Western liberals don't confront it, they will have "blood on their hands."

<p>What they don't say is how this war on terror should be conducted. 

<p>Should democracy be imposed at the point of a howitzer, as Bush suggested last week? Should all those tow-headed Republican kids who cheered him on at the Republican National Convention be drafted and shipped off to the Middle East and the 'Stans — remember them? 

<p>Should taxes be raised, medicare be cut, schools be closed to pay for all war all the time? Should civil rights be further curtailed, more Muslims rounded up or profiled, more protesters and peaceniks busted, and press freedoms restricted all in the name of protecting life, liberty and the pursuit of what is left of happiness under such conditions?

<p>In all their railing against Chechen terrorism in the former Soviet Union, few of these commentators draw the similarities to the Iraqi quagmire.

<p>Chechnya is an occupied, mostly Muslim nation, critical to the stability of the region, where as many as 200,000 people may have been killed or driven out, where cities have been reduced to rubble, and where oil flows, or would flow if the place hadn't been wrecked.

<p>Of course, the situation in Chechnya is far worse than in Iraq. The ugly events of Abu Ghraib aside, it's not likely that U.S. troops will ever stoop to the atrocities perpetuated on Chechens, many of whom ended up gang-raped, hacked to pieces and in mass graves.

<p>But the basic outlines — invasion, occupation and exploitation — are there.

<p>Watching the coverage on U.S. TV, it has been breathtaking to see the lack of depth and context provided. 

<p>Tuesday night on CNN, Anderson Cooper conducted a panel discussion with military intelligence analyst Ken Robinson and Moscow bureau chief Jill Dougherty that went on and on about the shocking video from inside the school, with speculative details on the nature of the bombs, but not one word about what this was all about. 

<p>Typical.

<p>It was as if the networks were thinking only in terms of what this could mean for Americans, but without daring to examine the root causes of such actions for fear of — what? — appearing liberal. 

<p>Even when Defence Secretary Donald Rumsfeld invoked Beslan to defend the Pentagon's actions in Iraq and Vice-President Dick Cheney said that the "wrong choice" on the coming election day could mean that terrorists will "hit" the States again, the cable hairdos fluffed over the obvious.

<p>Understand: There is absolutely no justification for taking innocent people, not to mention children, hostage, holding them in stifling heat, without food, water or bathroom privileges while waving bombs and sticking bayonets in them.

<p>But it's not all simply about, as Diane Francis put it on Tuesday, "a crazed Islamist guerrilla army bent on destabilizing, frightening and destroying all non-believers."

<p>As the New York Times' Paul Krugman wrote, "Step by step, the fight against Al Qaeda became a universal 'war on terror,' then a confrontation with the `axis of evil,' then a war against all evil everywhere. Nobody knows where it all ends."

<p>Maybe when the opportunistic scaremongering stops.
