<p>I'm not from the generation of the flower child, radical peacenik, or even bra-burning feminist; I'm from the generation of the apathetic. Unlike my parent's generation, we don't make it a habit to rally together and protest injustices. In my experience, my peers seem to be complacent with continuing on with the status quo.
<p>So what better way to break from the mundane surroundings of suburban college campus life than heading off to an anti-war protest in New York City?
<p> It would be the perfect place to meet people who shared my idealistic, counter-cultural opinions. In going, I would finally experience a protest like the baby boomers did and have my chance to 'fight the power.'
<p>  I first learned of the rally, marking the first anniversary of the start of the war, while surfing the Internet. It peaked my interest because I am staunchly against Bush and his policies. I was also fueled by my anger and distress that had welled up inside me after my boyfriend's Army National Guard unit was mobilized and sent to Iraq.

<!--/endimage/-->I went to New York that day without knowing if 10 or 10,000 people would be at the event. But once I stepped off the train and into Penn Station I realized I was going to be a part of something big.
<p> Groups of protestors gathered on the platforms of the station, doling out signs and t-shirts that identified their stand against the war. I knew then, I was exactly where I needed to be; in an environment with people like me, people who cared.
<p> Swept through the station concourses with the energy of the crowd, I emerged out onto the streets, where the excitement and passion of the protest was brewing in the cool, crisp air. People were chanting, waving signs and handing out anti-war paraphernalia. I stuffed my pockets with every flier and publication I could get my hands on, not only to read the thoughts of the alternative press, but also to serve as proof of having been on the streets that day.
<p>  I also saw protestors distributing the placards I had seen earlier in the train station. I knew I needed one. If I were holding a sign I would truly be a part of the day. No one could confuse me for a passer-by or curious on-looker. I would have the mark of a protestor.
<p>  But which to choose? I could be conservative in my choice. "Bring the troops home now" and "ReDefeat Bush" were strong candidates. Or I could transform myself into a complete leftist zealot and wave a sign like "Stop the 9-11 Cover-up" or "End the New Colonialism." In the end, I couldn't decide. So I swapped signs throughout the day, at times waving two at once.
<p> After walking a few blocks with my newfound compatriots toward the heart of the protest, I came face to face with a 17 ft. papier mache likeness of President Bush carrying a bomb marked with the word "Empire." Much to our dismay, the authorities had begun herding us through metal barricades for "crowd-control" purposes, further fueling the crowd's ardor. "We're not animals, you can't pen us in," I heard one protestor shout.
<p> Under Bush's watchful eye and drawn to the center of the action, I began to press through the burgeoning crowd that was now beginning to march down one of the city's broad avenues.
<p> I was surprised with the variety of people I came across. The streets were not flooded with the young, body-pierced kids I might've imagined. In fact, they appeared to be in the minority in this hodgepodge mix of protestors.
<p> Instead, I saw men my grandfather's age, members of a veteran's-against-the-war type organization, marching stoically in a rag-tag formation. I saw middle-aged women in conservative dress and salon-styled hair holding up signs urging Bush to bring their sons and daughters home from the war zone.
<p> And there were young children, held tightly in the arms of their parents, some joining the crowd's political chants.
<p> Of course, I'll be the first to admit I can be guilty of some of the same apathy I criticize in my peers.
<p> At one point, when it felt as if the cold would dismember the toes from my body, I escaped to the warmth and security of a posh little coffee shop along the protest route. I felt like a traitor, sitting there, sipping my caramel latte while I watched my radical cohorts steadfastly marching in the street just outside the big plate glass windows. But what can I say? I'm a product of a Starbucks world. I guess nobody's perfect.
<p> Later in the day, I found myself pinned against the barricades with no room to move. Deciding to make the best of an uncomfortable situation, I struck up conversation with two girls who looked about my age and sufficiently non-mainstream enough for my tastes.
<p> I started explaining my reasons for coming to the protest, including how my boyfriend had just been sent overseas. The girls were amazed by my intimate connection with the war.
<p> They called over reporters and photographers to talk with me. Unexpectedly, a Reuters photographer started snapping my picture and the news service's reporter came over to interview me. Later, a television reporter from Madrid took notice of the scene building around me and asked in broken English if she could interview me on-camera.
<p> Suddenly, I was a celebrity. My opinions, not to mention my face, would be beamed worldwide.  The next day I learned my picture and comments, in fact, were circulating on the Internet, on Reuters' and other news websites. Now I could truly say that my presence at the protest made a difference. I knew my voice was heard.
<p>  That day, I felt empowered; a feeling I don't usually experience on my sleepy suburban college campus. For one day, I got to become an activist in my own right, fighting the pro-Bush establishment.
