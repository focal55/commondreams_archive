A few weeks ago I walked into a toy store looking for a gift for my nephew. A shelf of action figures caught my eye and I began to chuckle as I saw G.I. Joe. It made me reminisce about my childhood.
<p> Then a curious thought ran through my mind. When I was little and playing with these toys, there was a war going on between the U.S. and Iraq, and a war-mongering Republican named Bush was in office. At the time G.I. Joe was big. Now we have another war in Iraq, a war-mongering Republican named Bush in office and G.I. Joe has made a comeback.<p> What was a moment of gleeful reflection suddenly made me sick. I began to realize how kids were being implanted with these subliminal messages from a seemingly harmless product. Republicans are pushing for products that will open the minds of the soldiers of tomorrow. This form of propaganda entices young people to serve their country, but they won't know that they're giving their lives to those who see them as expendable. For people who believe an economy can only succeed through war couldn't care less if you come back dead or alive.
