<p>The London based charity <a href="http://www.maic.org.uk" target="_new">Medical Aid for Iraqi Children</a>  has issued a wake up call which Iraq's "liberators" should ignore at their peril, not alone for the people of Iraq, but in respect of their own health.

<p>"Exposure to radioactive material used in the war" has already "led to an unusually high number of birth defects." Radiation being cumulative and the country's, fauna, flora, water table and thus produce and livestock already poisoned by the depleted uranium (which remains radioactive for four and a half billion years) from 1991,  radioactive and chemically toxic pollution has now risen again in orders of magnitude. Cancers and birth deformities, already epidemic since the first Gulf war, are now set to rise again. And as after 1991, will be reflected amongst British and US personnel. In one small southern US town with a high number of reservists (McGann, Mississippi) sixty seven percent of babies conceived after their return from the Gulf had rare or unusual congenital abnormalities.
<p>A staggering nearly eleven thousand US soldiers have already been flown out of Iraq ill and injured. Whilst the Pentagon refuses virtually any details of the nature of illnesses, it is not unreasonable to assume a substantial proportion will be suffering from a second "Gulf war syndrome". In the Balkans, where, compared to Iraq, a small amount of DU was used, a number of UN peacekeepers became ill with virulent cancers and died, within weeks, prompting a Portuguese Minister to state that he was not going to have his nationals become "radiation meat." If the US is really concerned about "dirty bombs" it need not look very far.

<p>Toxic, radioactive and other war related environmental factors; living conditions (lack of electricity, clean water, destroyed or damaged
sanitation) have already led to a tripling of maternal mortality rates women since the invasion. Over the embargo years it rose to one of the highest in the world, but now is a staggering three hundred and ten deaths per hundred thousand. In context, in Sweden, it is four per hundred thousand. Contagious diseases are rampant and troops too not immune.

<p>Neither Iraqis or troops are immune either from unexploded ordnance, particularly cluster bombs (which also contain DU) and  an estimated thousand or more children have already been grievously injured and killed. From womb, often to an early tomb, Iraq's children are the losers, with over half a million already estimated as in need of psychiatric care by UNICEF. In continuing
instability: "the trauma of war and violence has greatly affected children."

<p>Hospitals, looted after the invasion are without, or suffer severe shortages of everything. Pediatric hospitals lack, incubators, resuscitation trolleys, mucus extractors "to name just a few items."

<p>The Spinal Chord Injuries Center, is next to the bombed Red Cross building and was severely damaged, losing  much equipment. Staff are struggling to meet the needs of seven hundred severely injured and disabled patients.

<p>The Center for Heart Disease needs oxygen, canulae, butterfly needles, exchange transfusion sets. An average of five major operations a day, are down to perhaps two a week. May Al-Daftari, MAIC"s founder says: " MAIC has been overwhelmed by the colossal needs of hospitals during these critical times. "

<p>At the end of hostilities, on May 1st, MAIC sent ten tons of vitally needed medicines and equipment, designated for five hospitals, worth nearly a quarter of a million £'s to Basra, with Richard Branson's Virgin Airways, who flew in the consignment free, in a blaze of publicity. Arrangements had been made with the British Army to distribute to the southern hospitals. The US Administration in Baghdad had also given permission for the consignment. In the event, the US insisted it was transported to Baghdad. Deliveries were made to just three hospitals - and nearly one hundred thousand £'s worth of aid is still missing, including adult and children's wheelchairs. A shoddy, shameful incident.

<p>Mrs Al-Daftari, who is seeking compensation from the Ministry of Defense, is distraught at the loss of desperately needed, vital supplies and also the monies so many had worked so hard to raise. "What do I say to people like eight year old Sofia Tierney, who was so distressed by the war, she asked to have no birthday presents from her school friends and relations but to have money instead to send to us. She raised £one hundred and eight pounds."
<p>A spokesperson for the Ministry of Defense said the MOD co-operated with Virgin on details of the flight and the delivery of the consignment, taking into account the : "incredibly highly volatile and high risk situation". Whilst the British was in charge in Basra, they had no authority in Baghdad,
where: "a US Civil Affairs officer" agreed to collect the goods:" ...and get it out there." The US then handed the consignment to an aid agency new to Iraq, Korean Food for the Hungry, an evangelical movement whose mission
includes:  empowering ..."a biblically shaped view of the world" with
people: " ...advancing towards their Christian potential."

<p>"From a military point of view, we did our best to facilitate (the delivery,)" said the UK Ministry of Defense spokesperson. "But we must, in good faith, stress the US-Korean involvement. "The (US) Civil Affairs Officer at Baghdad Airport will say the same as I have, we are not responsible for the audit trail."

<p>Last month, "Interaction", the US representative body for
all US aid agencies issued  a scathing report on aid under the Bush Administration, citing 'increasingly incoherence' , reliance on private sector contractors and Department of Defense leading to 'a system submerged in bureaucracy.'
<p>Former U.N. Coordinator in Iraq and a former Assistant Secretary General, Denis Halliday is incensed at the loss: 'The negligence that allowed these medical supplies to be lost, reminds me of the conscious negligence of the (UN) Security Council as Iraqi children were being killed by UN sanctions.'

<p>A spokesperson for the Coalition Provisional Authority in Baghdad, said she
had: "No knowledge", of the MAIC shipment. Korean Aid for the Hungry in both Seoul and Canada could not be reached  by Mrs Al Daftari, who comments: "If the US and UK Authorities, cannot take care of two hundred thousand pounds worth of vital medical aid, how can they run a country?"
