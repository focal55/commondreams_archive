<p>Close your eyes and imagine this scenario. You take your daughter to the local Foot Locker or Reebok outlet because they have a deal for you. For only $80.50 a girl can get her pink G6 sneakers: the G-Unit Collection, a sneaker line launched by rap star “50 Cent” and Reebok. Maybe she can get her own signed CD from “50 Cent” featuring those timeless classics, “Surrounded by Hoes” or a soon to be golden oldie, “I smell Pussy.” 50 Cent, a new cultural hero, debases women as hoes and bitches, yet he will donate some of the proceeds of the sneaker sales to “charitable causes.” Will all those whores who have been bitch slapped or beaten by real pimps breathe a sigh of relief? 50 Cent is paying a Judas wage to soothe his conscience and Reebok can claim to be a “good corporate citizen.” 

 

 

   <p>  The Nokia Corporation not to be outdone, is the sponsor of this year’s Super Bowl gala, will feature Snoop Dogg: immoral lyricist, adult movie maker and rap star who has been accused of baiting underage teen girls to bare their bodies for “Girls Gone Wild” videos. Snoop Dogg glorifies pimps, insults women and glorifies violence: no wonder he will entertain America and much of the world on one of the most watched television events of the year, he is the poster boy of the new Corporate America’s shameful profits at any cost philosophy. American “culture” is dragging its belly through the gutter. Sadly, some entertainers of color seemingly are now enslaved on a new plantation where the taskmasters are corporate charlatans seducing young artists to cross all lines of decency for the quick buck. Civil rights’ activists must sadly watch as some undue 50 years of social gain for minorities. Martin Luther King Jr. would cringe at how easy some in his community are selling out.

 

 

   <p>  Spare me the first amendment arguments, the stifling of creativity viewpoints or the right for Darwinian capitalism to be as “doggy eat doggy” as possible: excuse the pun. I grew up in an urban area, I witnessed the violence of pimps and seedy side of the prostitution underworld: it is nothing to sing about, yet alone, glorify. My thoughts are simple: aren’t the parents or guardians of the tens of millions of children in this nation paying attention? This is not Elvis shaking his pelvis or the long hair of the Beatles. This is raw, degrading and violent rhyming passed off as art and its beat is ingraining a new low of depravity into our youth’s culture and big business wants a chunk of the blood money.  

 

   <p>  The line between social responsibility and profit making is always in transition. It always is reined in and reset by a society that gauges the limits of capitalism and sets parameters between earnings and exploitation. Those lines are now so blurred that we are willing to pimp off our own children: ethically, socially, morally and reprehensibly for the dollar. The role of adults is to teach and lead children through the minefield of childhood. Often, that role includes making decisions that bring resentment and scorn from children: often that disenchantment shown by youngsters is a gauge of how well those elders are doing their jobs.

 

  <p>   As a teacher I listen to my students in the hallways. Vulgarity is so common, so mundanely used, you might think that the number of adjectives in some children’s vocabulary number below ten. Unflinchingly they refer to each other as bitches or hoes, some when rebuked by a teacher will simply state, “fuck you” with no remorse or guilt even declaring it is their right to express dismay in such stark terms. Remarkably, even with this utter sickening saturation amongst our children, many children yearn for adults to set guidelines and offer sanction from plummeting into this cultureless abyss. No matter how hip society claims to be, children need to be counseled. Dressing children in thongs, painted up in makeup or posturing as pseudo-adults can never change their chronological age or the lack of experience that comes with childhood. Certain corporate powers seek to rip the word “child” out of childhood: but some adults are not buying it. 

 

 <p>    I am casting my stone of discontent into the “proverbial pond” hoping that minute ripples will cascade into giant waves of discontent and action. As an athlete and coach, I cannot remember missing a Super Bowl, but I will break that streak this year. Nokia has the right to earn profits and I have the right to urge young and old alike to spurn them. Snoop Dogg, you need to get a life and take a long look in the mirror and you will see a real whore. 

 

 <p>    You will not see me wearing any Reebok apparel, or my two daughters, and the Reebok warm-ups I received as a present are headed to the rag bin. Reebok and Nokia are playing Americans as chumps. I still believe that the majority of elders in this country hold their children in high esteem and could punish Reebok and Nokia where it hurts the most: the quarterly profit sheet.
