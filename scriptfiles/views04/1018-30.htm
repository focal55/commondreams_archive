There is 7-year-old George W. Bush — or rather, an actor portraying him — offering solace to his mother following the death of his sister. When a neighbor boy wants to play ball, serious George tells him he must stay home. "His mother needed him," intones a voiceover.

<p>There is something reminiscent of L. Ron Hubbard in that recreation of a boyhood episode in the new DVD, "George W. Bush: Faith in the White House": Right from childhood, this was the anointed one we've awaited.

<p>There are many such moments in this 70-minute documentary, deceptively billed as "An Alternative Program to FAHRENHEIT 9/11." Obviously not meant for Bush doubters — 300,000 free copies have been sent to churches around the nation — this is an unsubtle attempt to ratify Bush as God's CEO on Earth.

<p>Largely anecdotal, and relying on faith-based talking heads rather than reality, the movie's message is never in doubt: George W. Bush was tapped by God to lead at this turbulent time, his life echoes the parable of the Prodigal Son, he discerns — and takes — "God's side" in all decisions, and any who oppose him give aid and comfort to the "forces of evil that threaten our existence."

<p>In this movie, Bush has "the moral clarity of a biblical prophet" and acts on "promptings" from God. Just to make it all clear, the president is juxtaposed with a wall-sized painting of Jesus, and opposite Jesus in a split screen behind the narrator. It's a wonder the movie doesn't offer viewers a list of "begats."

<p>Meanwhile, Bush critics, from Al Franken to liberal Christian Jim Wallis, are quoted in voiceovers that strain for snooty pomposity, just for emphasis. Such critics supposedly equate a terrorist "strapping a bomb onto his 14-year-old son" to Bush's hugging a 14-year-old girl who lost her mother on Sept. 11.

<p>This documentary studiously avoids anything that could tarnish the president's near-divinity. His drinking days are explored only as a lead-in to his conversion, and even then, the film makes excuses: Bush, like all hard-working oil-patch grunts — as if he had been one — drank to quench a "thirst (that) comes from a throat full of Texas dust." He was just thirsty!

<p>Bush credits "God and his mercy" for lifting his addiction, and I applaud that. The 12-step programs credited by many experts with success in treating addiction urge addicts to rely on a loving "higher power" (of their choice) to stay clean and sober,

<p>But watch Bush in action, and it's clear he's never adopted the self-examination or humility that such groups also prescribe: He never admits a mistake. Nor does this film: For example, it lauds his refusal to "go negative" in his campaign for governor, ignoring his current reelection strategy to trash his opponent. And Bush's combativeness during debates is a lousy advertisement for humility.

<p>Amid all the myth-making, you won't hear ugly facts like this: In 1993 — post boozing — when Bush was asked what he'd say to Israeli Jews, he "joked," "You're all going to hell." The movie notes more than once that he swore off swearing, but that didn't stop him from saying, "F*** Saddam, we're taking him out" or calling a reporter an "a**hole."

<p>The president's "blessed" business career is totally whitewashed. Taxpayers around Dallas will be very surprised to hear that "he built a new stadium" for the Texas Rangers. His "successful" oil companies all tanked, but not in this bizarro-world documentary. And there's no mention of his sketchy military career. The film reminds me very much of the way Scientologists have obscured and exaggerated L. Ron Hubbard's life in their zeal to sanctify their man-god.

<p>But this is more than an attempt to confirm Bush as God's Own President. Quoting the Founding Fathers, it concludes that America is a Christian nation (perhaps they mean after Jews and Muslims and agnostics all go to hell...). We need more radical Christianity in government, it posits. Plurality bites.

<p>Most American presidents have been men of real faith. But George W. Bush seems to be the first who believes his every decision is a perfect enactment of God's will, and this propaganda film believes it, too.

<p>This "Hubbardization" of the president flirts with blasphemy.
