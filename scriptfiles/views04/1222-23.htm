<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p>President Bush says that Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld is doing &quot;a very fine job.&quot;
<p>So it seems that, even when conservatives such as Sen. John McCain and Weekly Standard editor William Kristol express a lack of confidence in Rumsfeld, Bush remains unmoved.</p><p>What that should tell Americans is that Rumsfeld is not the problem, Bush is.</p><p>The secretary of defense is not imposed on the president. In fact, it&#39;s the other way around. The secretary of defense is imposed on the country by the president.</p><p>As such, the griping about Rumsfeld&#39;s missteps - which seem now to be coming on an almost daily basis - misses the point. Rumsfeld may be the wrong secretary of defense, but it is the president who is wrong - wrong to keep Rumsfeld in a position of authority.</p><p>Rumsfeld has been neglecting the most basic of tasks, such as signing letters of condolence to the families of soldiers killed in Iraq. The secretary of defense now says that he will sign the letters personally rather than running them through the auto-signing machine.</p><p>But if Rumsfeld wants to send meaningful letters to the families of the dead, he should make them notes of apology. He could begin by apologizing for sending the troops into combat without proper armor and then go on to apologize for suggesting that the army is the one he had at the point when the war began - as opposed to the one he wanted.</p><p>Before they go into the post, however, Rumsfeld ought to take the letters over to the White House and get Bush to sign on. After all, the only apology that will really matter is the one in which the president admits that this war was neither necessary nor justified. </p><p align="CENTER">&copy; 2004 Capital Times<p align="CENTER">###<!-- #EndEditable --></font></td>
