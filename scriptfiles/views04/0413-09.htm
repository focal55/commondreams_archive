<p>It has not been a bad week in Iraq. It's been a bad year. The last several days have only restated the obvious violently enough to cut through the smiley hoax the Bush administration is painting on a disaster entirely of its own making.
<p>Opponents of the war in Iraq are criticized for only opposing, not proposing. Easy for war enthusiasts to say. Opponents had a fine proposal in 2003. Don't invade. The warmongers knew the risks, the doubts, the shady evidence for war. They pressed on anyway. A blunder has become a graveyard. So when warmongers blame war opponents for "only" opposing, they're rewriting the past to deflect accountability for the mistake. That's what shifty leadership does. It was on display again last Thursday as national security adviser Condoleezza Rice invented a president and a White House "at battle stations" in the summer of 2001, when Bush was, in fact, at his ranch in Crawford, Texas, playing golf, bantering about his 55th birthday with reporters and splitting stem cells in four.

<p>Still, the Iraq mistake is a done deed. What now? War enthusiasts may be about to make a bad situation worse -- more force, more unilateralism. But, at least, they're engaging the issues. Opponents of war have been mealy-mouthed, contradictory or smugly silent, as if the mounting death toll is an abstraction that merely vindicates their convictions, when it should be a daily cry for alternatives. Here then is a summarized attempt to answer three questions: What we shouldn't have done; what we shouldn't do; what we should do. To answer in 500 words is surely glib, but it's a 25,000 percent improvement over the two words that led to war in the first place ("Get Saddam").

<p><img src="../../images/smallsquarebullet.gif" width="9" height="9"> What we shouldn't have done: "The sacrifice endured by the United States is surely repaid by what has already been accomplished," William F. Buckley tells Time, summing up the shrunken notion that removing Saddam Hussein was victory enough. It isn't. Saddam shouldn't have been removed by American force but left to die under the weight of his own well-contained irrelevance, even if he had weapons of mass destruction. If Buckley and his brand of virtuehawks were willing enough to let big-league dictators from Stalin to Mao to Pol Pot dig mass graves for millions on the assumption that there'd be a grave for them sooner or later, the same invitation to self-destruction might have been extended to Saddam's minor-league mayhems. And if the virtuehawks hadn't spent decades apologizing and propping up dictatorships from Chile to Indonesia by way of -- and including, for two decades -- Saddam's own, their born-again faith in freedom and democracy might not have looked so suspiciously oily.

<p><img src="../../images/smallsquarebullet.gif" width="9" height="9"> What we shouldn't do: Pull out now, hand over the reins of government to Iraqis June 30, or continue to pretend that democracy is a viable option in a country that not only has never known it, but one that has only contempt for it and whose dominant and insistently regressive religion would not allow it. Iraq's governing council is a Washington Beltway creation of mercenary politicians. It has no legitimacy in Iraqis' eyes. Nor will the illusion of a government scheduled to take over on June 30 in the shadow of American tanks. At this point in Iraq, "democracy" as the Bush White House understands it is an invitation to civil war, more blood-shed, and the risk of infecting neighboring countries with more inflammations of Islamic radicalism.

<p><img src="../../images/smallsquarebullet.gif" width="9" height="9"> What we should do: Fire Paul Bremer, the American proconsul in Iraq, whose heavy-handed rule and misjudgments have lit fuses instead of winning hearts. Send the message that this is no longer a partisan affair and offer the job to Bill Clinton, who'll refuse, but not without risking losing the credibility of any constructive opposition at home. Retreat from Fallujah-like dens of resistance and pointless U.S. deaths before they turn into so many Khe Sahns. Let Iraqis have what they will. Then double the American troop presence elsewhere to live up to an occupation army's mandate to ensure ordinary citizens' safety and give a humanitarian offensive one last chance to win over hearts. Concede that the invasion without a U.N. mandate was a colossal mistake, then beg the international community for manpower and money, with assurances of power-sharing. Abandon hopes of democracy. Let Iraqis have the government they wish and, therefore, deserve, be it another dictatorship or a theocracy. Then set a firm deadline for an American exit. Clinton did it in Somalia regardless of what it might mean to Somalis. Time for Bush to do it in Iraq for no more than a year from now, with plenty of room for U.N. replacements if Iraqis want them. And this November, not a moment or a wasted life too soon, fire Bush.
