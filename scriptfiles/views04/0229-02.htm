<p> 
President George W. Bush's re-election campaign opened this month on the wild mountainous frontier between Pakistan and Afghanistan where, according to Pentagon leaks, a cornered Osama bin Laden is about to be captured by U.S. Special Forces.
<BR>
<BR>
We have heard such claims before. But this time, large numbers of U.S. troops hunting America's arch enemy have been told by the White House to get bin Laden at all costs - well before next November's elections.
<BR>
<BR>
And they may be close to their quarry.
<BR>
<BR>
Pakistan's military ruler, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, is playing the key role in hunting bin Laden. He has put his powerful armed forces and intelligence services at the disposal of the U.S., in spite of intense public opposition.
<BR>
<BR>
Musharraf is also allowing U.S. forces pursuing bin Laden to covertly operate inside Pakistan.
<BR>
<BR>
Politically isolated and increasingly unpopular, Pakistan's strongman has come to depend on U.S. support to maintain his grip on power, like another U.S. client, Afghanistan's figurehead leader, Hamid Karzai.
<BR>
<BR>
Musharraf's recent one-sided diplomatic concessions to India over the bitter Kashmir dispute, which shocked and angered many Pakistanis, are a sign of his political weakness and growing U.S. influence over his regime.
<BR>
<BR>
Last year, Osama bin Laden predicted his own death in combat in 2004. He may well prove to be right about his own fate. But will removal of Saddam Hussein and then bin Laden make America safer, as Bush claims?
<BR>
<BR>
No. According to CIA Director George Tenet, the terrorist threat will remain high, "with or without al-Qaida."
<BR>
<BR>
Tenet - for once - is right. Al-Qaida, an organization that never exceeded a few hundred men even at its height, was never the vast threat claimed by the White House and U.S. media. At least a score of other anti-American groups are active from Morocco to Indonesia, the North African Salafist groups being among the most dangerous.
<BR>
<BR>
The Bush administration has inflamed most of the Muslim world by its invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq, antagonistic rhetoric, and tacit support for Israel's harsh treatment of the Palestinians.
<BR>
<BR>
<B>Host of new enemies</B>
<BR>
<BR>
Bush's anti-Islamic policies, designed to play to domestic special interests, have generated a host of new enemies abroad - a perpetual-motion conflict machine run by a president who thrives on war and crises. No wonder anti-American foes are popping up faster than they can be counted.
<BR>
<BR>
We are still not even sure al-Qaida was responsible for 9/11, as Bush insists.
<BR>
<BR>
After promising in 2002 to release proof of al-Qaida's guilt for 9/11, the administration never did. Much of the legal evidence cited so far by the U.S. against al-Qaida comes from a former fugitive member who embezzled its funds.
<BR>
<BR>
Interestingly, much of the "evidence" about Iraq came from another convicted embezzler, Ahmad Chalabi.
<BR>
<BR>
German courts recently determined the 9/11 plot was hatched in Hamburg, not Afghanistan, and could find no direct link to al-Qaida. Al-Qaida leaders certainly applauded 9/11 - after the fact - but may not have been actively involved in planning or finance.
<BR>
<BR>
There is little doubt al-Qaida was behind the bombings of U.S. targets abroad, like the USS Cole and attacks in East Africa. The 9/11 plotters were mostly from Saudi Arabia and operated from Germany. Yet 9/11 was the pretext the U.S. used to invade Afghanistan.
<BR>
<BR>
<B>U.S. supplied Taliban</B>
<BR>
<BR>
Many of what the White House called "terrorist training camps" in Afghanistan were actually bases for groups fighting to liberate communist-ruled Uzbekistan, Kazakstan, and Tajikistan; Chinese-ruled Eastern Turkestan; Indian-ruled Kashmir; and the southern Philippines. Their members (some of whom may now be prisoners in Guantanamo) had nothing to do with 9/11. As for the Taliban, the U.S. supplied it with millions in aid until four months before 9/11.
<BR>
<BR>
The White House should show the world proof of its claims about al-Qaida and bin Laden. Doing so would convince millions of people who regard him as a hero that he was indeed a cold-blooded murderer.
<BR>
<BR>
Capturing Saddam did not long arrest Bush's falling polls. But eliminating bin Laden, and proclaiming victory in the  war on terrorism, will certainly keep Bush in office.
<BR>
<BR>
But this strategy has a dangerous flipside. If, before November elections, al-Qaida finally manages to stage a devastating attack on the U.S. mainland, as its No. 2, Ayman al-Zawahiri, threatens, Bush will face popular outrage and be sliced and diced by Democrats.
<BR>
<BR>
Luckily for the U.S., what's left of al-Qaida has so far produced more hot air than explosions. Hopefully, the alleged dangers from al-Qaida will be no more substantial than Iraq's infamous but non-existent "drones of death."
<BR>
<BR>
Bin Laden vows before his death to punish America for Afghanistan, Iraq and Palestine. Unfortunately, he's usually  been a man of his word. So optimism is not yet in order.
