<p>It's a nifty trick. 

<P>On the evening news, two talking heads - one liberal,
one conservative - trade verbal shots over the war in
Iraq. 

<P>"And let's not forget," says the conservative, "We are
fighting the war on terrorism in Iraq."

<P>"Come on," says the incredulous liberal, "you know
there was no connection between Iraq and al-Qaeda."

<P>"Really?" says the conservative, "My son is fighting
in Iraq. He's fighting al-Zarqawi. And you know as
well as I do that al-Zarqawi is connected to bin Laden
and al-Qaeda." 

<P>"No," says the liberal, not buying the backward logic,
"we created the terrorist situation in Iraq by
invading the country, not the other way round." 

<P>Sadly, the liberal missed the point: on most days, a
good story beats the straight truth. That al-Zarqawi
appeared as the terrorist enemy only after the
invasion was not relevant to the good story. What was
relevant was that the war in Iraq was suddenly
becoming what George W. Bush said it was: the war on
terrorism. 

<P>The Bush administration knows its history. Spinning
illegal invasions into righteous liberations has been
an effective practice for a thousand years. 

<P>In 1066, William of Normandy invaded, occupied, and
plundered Saxon England. But history remembers
William's invasion as one of righteous liberation.
Why? Because William had the sense to spin his crime
into heroic art on the Bayeux Tapestry. That is, he
told a good story.

<P>Of course, much like Bush's invasion of Iraq, the true
story of William's invasion of England was something
altogether darker and more brutish. It is a story with
a frightening modern day moral.

<P>In December, 1065, the King of England - Edward the
Confessor - was dying. He had no clear successor, and
many lords laid claims to the throne. But two nobles
were front runners. One was Earl Harold, an English
lord. And the second was William of Normandy, a lord
of a large, prosperous stretch of northern France. 

<P>When Edward died in January 1066, Earl Harold claimed
the throne. But he soon had to defend his claim
against the claim of the foreigner, William. 

<P>Was William's claim to the English throne justified?
William knew a good opportunity when he saw it - a
weakened England with no clearly established leader
and a land full of rich natural resources - so that
was claim enough.

<P>In late 1066, travelling with a large army, William
set sail for England. He landed near Hastings, in the
south of England, where he and Harold engaged in
battle. And in a day, William destroyed Harold's army
and killed King Harold. 

<P>From there, William systematically destroyed all Saxon resistance, laying waste to the people and country. Norman French leaders quickly took over all important positions in England, and the country was duly plundered.

<P>But William had a public relations problem. Since he
was not the rightful heir to the thrown, and since he
had brutally invaded and plundered England, he needed
an image make over if the people of England were to
accept his rule. So he commissioned the Bayeux
Tapestry.

<P>The seventy metre long, embroidered tapestry tells the
tale of William's invasion - but tells it backward,
using the outcome to justify the means. According to
the Tapestry, William's invasion was the story of
England's righteous liberation from Harold, a usurper
and dictator. 

<P>It made a good story. 

<P>No doubt, the English people at the time knew the
tapestry's story was false. But as the years passed,
the myth of William the Conqueror as liberator of
England overtook the reality.

<P>Sound familiar? It will.

<P>Today - since the Weapons of Mass Destruction story
failed, and since the al-Qaeda Links to Saddam story
failed - the Bush administration is busily weaving its
newest story in a Baghdad Tapestry, of sorts. 

<P>And this story unfolds nicely: 9/11 is connected to
al-Qaeda. Al-Qaeda is connected to al-Zarqawi.
Al-Zarqawi is connected to Iraq. Thus, 9/11 was
justifiable grounds for America's righteous liberation
of Iraq.

<P>Remember, on most days, straight truth is less
interesting than a good story. And like the Bayeux
Tapestry, the finished Baghdad Tapestry will certainly
tell a good story. 

<P>And then, one day not long from now, our children will celebrate the invasion of Iraq as George the Conqueror's great war against terror. 

<P>It's a nifty trick.
