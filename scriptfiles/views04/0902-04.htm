<p>John Kerry is politically tone deaf.


<p>This week, with many American voters uncomfortable with his personality and viewing him as "not a regular guy," Kerry goes off to Nantucket, of all places, the island of the elite. (Kerry similarly vacationed with the hoity-toity after his primary victory, when he went snowboarding in Ketchum, Idaho.)


<p>This week, with millions of supporters desperate to get Bush out of office, there was Kerry striking an insouciant pose, windsurfing off the Nantucket beaches. Memo to Kerry: The campaign is not some backdrop for your wannabe Kennedy photo shoots.


<p>Is the guy clueless?


<p>The Republicans have been kicking the living crap out of him, first with the slanderous Swift Boat squad and now with the ridicule brigade in New York.


<p>Kerry was woefully tardy in returning fire on the Swifties, and he and other Democrats have barely responded to the gang tackling at the Republican convention.


<p>Why Kerry decamped to Nantucket is beyond me. This week, he should have holed up in Scranton, Pennsylvania, or Toledo, Ohio, or Eau Claire, Wisconsin--or spent a day in each.


<p>Instead, he abided by some ridiculous unwritten rule somewhere that says it's impolite to campaign during the other guy's convention.


<p>Impolite?!


<p>The Republicans have long since taken the gloves off, and Kerry is still playing by the Marquis of Queensberry rules.


<p>If he really wants to win, Kerry has to work harder and fight harder.


<p>And if he can't fake being a regular guy, the least he can do is not flaunt his elitism.


<p>Otherwise, he'll have plenty of time to snowboard in Ketchum and windsurf on Nantucket after November 2.
