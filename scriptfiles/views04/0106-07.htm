<p>What a pity that the liberal American grassroots group MoveOn (<A HREF="http://www.moveon.org" TARGET="_new">http://www.moveon.org</A>) exposed a flank to critics waiting for an opportunity to discredit this burgeoning organization.

<p>The Web-based MoveOn made its misstep last month when, as part of its brilliant campaign to unseat President George W. Bush next November, it invited people to submit political TV ads. The best would get big time airtime in primetime, to fight against the well-oiled Bush re-election campaign. (A record-breaking $200 million U.S. war chest so far — and no rival Republican candidate in sight!)

<p>More than 1,500 contending ads were delivered to the Web site (<A HREF="http://www.bushin30seconds.org" TARGET="_new">http://www.bushin30seconds.org</A>) where the 15 finalists can now be viewed. Among them, animation of the Bush administration singing "Our polls and the Nasdaq looking grim/Took a lesson from my daddy and bombed a Muslim" and graphic depictions of the cost of the attack on Iraq.

<p>The winner will be determined next Monday in New York City at a public screening before a panel of celebrity leftish-libbers that includes Michael Moore, Jack Black, Janeane Garofalo, Al Franken and Margaret Cho. 

<p>When it announced its contest, MoveOn, which has been gaining members, media attention and major money in recent months, said it would not be posting "anything that would be inappropriate for television." 

<p>All was going really well — until yesterday when the Republican National Committee and the anti-Semitism fighting Anti-Defamation League (ADL) issued releases, concomitant with an op-ed piece in the Wall Street Journal, condemning MoveOn for posting two ads comparing Bush with Adolf Hitler. 

<p>Ooops. 

<p>In both cases, the filmmakers drew parallels between Americans bombing innocent civilians and Nazis bombing innocent civilians. They also made links between Hitler's demagoguery and Bush's oratory.

<p>No question that the ads go way beyond satire and that posting them, in the words of the ADL, "cheapens the level of political discourse in America" — as if that were possible, what with Fox News and all. That said, they represent the point of view of millions, if not in America then certainly elsewhere. 

<p>Just ask any dead Iraqi civilian. 

<p>As if you could.

<p>Fact is, the right has been gunning for MoveOn for a while, especially since late last year when wealthy philanthropists such as George Soros pledged millions to its Voter Fund. The donors do so to counteract the corporate contributions that pour into the Republican coffers, money that overwhelms a democratic process by creating an uneven advantage in resources. 

<p>And so it's laughable that, say, the mighty Wall Street Journal feels threatened by a little Web site run by six people in their homes scattered across the U.S.

<p>Which brings me to the Internet in general, and more specifically, the Web sites that are a welcome alternative to the mainstream. The folks who pour their hearts, time and many of their personal resources into these labours of love and democracy deserve attention, praise and, most important, money from Web surfers who visit their sites.

<p>I can't begin to list all the sites that I rely on to cull and comb through all the news in the media universe so I can quit my computer and have a life. And forget about the bloggers; there's just too many of them. 

<p>But for readers looking for more than what the mainstream corporate media offer, here's a very short list of my daily must-reads: Danny Schechter's <A HREF="http://www.mediachannel.org" TARGET="_new">mediachannel.org</A>; William River Pitt's <A HREF="http://www.truthout.org" TARGET="_new">truthout.org</A>; Citizens For Legitimate Government (<A HREF="http://www.legitgov.org" TARGET="_new">http://www.legitgov.org</A>); <A HREF="http://www.TomPaine.com" TARGET="_new">TomPaine.com</A>; the Center for Media and Democracy (<A HREF="http://www.prwatch.org" TARGET="_new">prwatch.org</A>); Fairness and Accuracy In Reporting (<A HREF="http://www.fair.org" TARGET="_new">fair.org</A>), <A HREF="http://www.Cursor.org" TARGET="_new">Cursor.org</A>; Sam Smith's Progress Review (<A HREF="http://www.prorev.com" TARGET="_new">prorev.com</A>), <A HREF="http://www.Commondreams.org" TARGET="_new">CommonD reams.org</A> and <A HREF="http://www.Buzzflash.com" TARGET="_new">Buzzflash.com</A>. In Canada, try Tony Sutton's beautiful <A HREF="http://www.Coldtype.net" TARGET="_new">Coldtype.net</A> — which carries my scribbling as well as that of vastly superior George Monbiot, John Pilger and other columnists — as well as Judy Rebick's <A HREF="http://www.Rabble.ca" TARGET="_new">Rabble.ca</A> and Ish Theilheimer's <A HREF="http://www.Straightgoods.com" TARGET="_new">Straightgoods.com</A>. Try these and you'll find the links to many others.

<p>Most of these sites are now appealing for funding and I have contributed to some. In 2004, I'll be spending money not on trashy style and celebrity rags but on reading that matters. 

<p>That's my New Year's resolution. Make it yours as well.

<p>Ask yourself what's really important: Finding out what Nicole Kidman is wearing to the Golden Globes? Or learning the truth about what's happening to the globe?
