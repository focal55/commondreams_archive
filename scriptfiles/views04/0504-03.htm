<p>Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia recently handed down a lengthy opinion attempting to justify his failure to disqualify himself from a case involving an old friend, Vice President Richard Cheney. 

<p>The Sierra Club, a plaintiff in the case, has charged that Cheney falsely reported the membership of the energy advisory group that he chaired. One ground given for Scalia's disqualification in that case is that he and Cheney have admittedly been good friends for more than a quarter of a century. 

<p>Ironically, in the course of trying to refute that justification for disqualification in the energy case, Scalia has unintentionally made the far more important point that he should have disqualified himself in 2000 from Bush v. Gore, which made his old friend Dick Cheney the vice president of the United States.

<p>The Federal Disqualification Statute expressly applies to justices of the Supreme Court, and requires disqualification whenever a justice's impartiality "might" reasonably be "questioned." As explained by the Supreme Court in 1988, this broad language is intended to avoid "suspicions and doubts" about the integrity of judges. Accordingly, the court said, judges should recuse themselves to avoid the appearance of impropriety "whenever possible."

<p>A central contention of Scalia's self-justification in the energy case is that Cheney is not being sued personally, but only in his official capacity as vice president. Thus, Scalia asserts, Cheney is simply a stand-in for "the government," having nothing personal at stake. That is, of course, nonsense, because Cheney's integrity and reputation are on the line in that case. But let it pass. The important point here is Scalia's concession that his friendship with Cheney would "assuredly" be a basis for disqualification whenever Cheney has a personal stake in litigation before the court.

<p>Which takes us to Bush v. Gore. The Supreme Court of Florida had ordered a recount of ballots, which was expected to give the election to Al Gore. Flip-flopping on its avowed commitment to local government, the Bush-Cheney ticket took the case away from the state court and into the U.S. Supreme Court. There, a 4-4 tie would have affirmed the Florida court's decision. But Antonin Scalia cast the deciding vote, giving Bush and Cheney the election. Whether Cheney was a named party is not material. 

<p>As the Supreme Court has expressly held, the disqualification issue turns not on who is named in a case but on who has a substantial interest in the outcome of the case - as Cheney unquestionably did in Bush v. Gore.

<p>Scalia has contended that a 4-4 tie in the Supreme Court is such a bad thing that the disqualification statute shouldn't mean the same thing for Supreme Court justices as for all other judges. But the statute makes no such distinction. And Scalia himself has written, "Congress can enact foolish statutes as well as wise ones, and it is not for the courts to decide which is which and rewrite the latter."

<p>Moreover, Scalia's rewrite of the disqualification statute would mean that a 4-4 tie, affirming the court below, is somehow worse than having the Supreme Court's decision determined by a justice whose vote is crucial in making his old friend vice president. 

<p>In a State of the Union address, George W. Bush inveighed against "activist judges" who, "without regard for the will of the people ... insist on forcing their arbitrary will upon the people." Perhaps Congress should hold hearings on Supreme Court justices who flout the will of the people, and who bring the administration of justice into disrepute, by sitting in cases from which they have clearly been disqualified under federal law. <p><I>Monroe H.
