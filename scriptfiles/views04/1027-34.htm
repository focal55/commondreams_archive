note: Last month, <A HREF="http://www.workingforchange.com" TARGET="_new">workingforchange</A> 
ran a piece by comedian Will Durst entitled Stupid people love Bush. Unlike that 
piece -- which was satirical -- this piece is factual.</I><p>Oh, you sweet, innocent, 
carefree citizens in non-swing states. You have no idea how much fun and slime 
you are missing. <p>In the swingers, wolves stalk us mercilessly (as the pro-wolf 
lobby points out indignantly, no one has ever been killed by wolves on U.S. soil, 
but try arguing that in the face of the relentless new TV ad campaign). Breaking 
news everywhere -- 380 tons of high explosives in Iraq left unattended, stock 
market down to year's low, leading economic indicators down, more tragedy in Iraq, 
the Swift Boat Liars are back, more Halliburton scandal, George Tenet says the 
war in Iraq is "wrong" -- it feels like you're dodging meteorites here in the 
Final Days. <p>Actually, the best evidence suggests we need to slow way down and 
go way back, because far from being able to take in anything new, it turns out 
many of our fellow citizens, especially Bush supporters, are stuck like bugs in 
amber in some early misperceptions that have never been cleared up. <p>It seems 
the majority of Bush supporters, according to recent polls, still believe Saddam 
Hussein had ties to Al Qaeda and even to 9-11, and that the United States found 
weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. Many of you are asking how that could possibly 
be, since everybody knows... <p>But everybody doesn't know. There it is. And if 
you are wondering why everybody doesn't know, you can either blame it on the media, 
always a shrewd move, or take notice that the administration is STILL spreading 
this same misinformation. <p>Both Donald Rumsfeld and Bush have publicly acknowledged 
there is no evidence of any links between Saddam Hussein and Al Qaeda. However, 
as Dick Cheney campaigns, a standard part of his stump speech is the accusation 
that Saddam Hussein "had a relationship" with Al Qaeda or "has long-established 
ties to Al Qaeda." He makes this claim up to the present day. The 9-11 Commission, 
however, found that there was "no collaborative relationship" between the two. 
<p>Cheney, of course, also has never given up his touching faith that Iraq had 
weapons of mass destruction, recently referring to a "nuclear" program that had 
in fact been abandoned shortly after the first Gulf War. Bush and Cheney misled 
the country into war using these two false premises, and it turns out an enormous 
number of our fellow citizens still believe both of them to be true. It's not 
because they're stupid, but because an administration they trust is still telling 
them both phony propositions are true. <p>Normally, when you get a situation like 
that -- where people are simply not acknowledging reality -- it is considered 
a cult, a form of groupthink based on irrational beliefs propagated by what is 
normally a charismatic leader. So those Kerry volunteers earnestly engaging Bush 
supporters on the latest outrage are way off base. They need to go all the way 
back to the Two Great Lies that got us into this: Many American soldiers marching 
into Iraq believed it was "payback for 9-11." <p>A third slightly blinding fact 
(to me) is that more people now think Kerry behaved shamefully in regards to Vietnam 
than did W. Bush. Incredible what brazen lying will do, isn't it? <p>A friend 
of Bush's dad got him into the "champagne unit" of the Texas Air National Guard, 
a unit packed with the sons of the privileged trying to stay out of Vietnam, and 
he failed to complete his service there. Kerry is a genuine, bona fide war hero. 
The men who served on his boat are supporting him for president, but those who 
didn't serve with him, who weren't there, who don't know what happened, have been 
given more credence. Wolves will get you! <p>In further unhappy evidence of how 
ill-informed the American people are (blame the media), the Program on International 
Policy Attitudes found Bush supporters consistently ill-informed about Bush's 
stands on the issues (Kerry-ans, by contrast, are overwhelmingly right about his 
positions). Eighty-seven percent of Bush supporters think he favors putting labor 
and environmental standards into international trade agreements. Eighty percent 
of Bush supporters believe Bush wants to participate in the treaty banning landmines. 
Seventy-six percent of Bush supporters believe Bush wants to participate in the 
treaty banning nuclear weapons testing. Sixty-two percent believe Bush would participate 
in the International Criminal Court. Sixty-one percent believe Bush wants to participate 
in the Kyoto Treaty on global warming. Fifty-three percent does not believe Bush 
is building a missile defense system, a.k.a. "Star Wars." <p>The only two Bush 
stands the majority of his supporters got right were on increasing defense spending 
and who should write the new Iraqi constitution. <p>Kerry supporters, by contrast, 
know their man on seven out of eight issues, with only 43 percent understanding 
he wants to keep defense spending the same but change how the money is spent, 
and 57 percent believing he wants to up it. <p>So what's going on here? I do not 
think Kerry people are smarter than Bush people, so why are they better-informed? 
Maybe a small percentage of ideological right-wingers don't believe anything the 
Establishment media say, but I don't think this is a matter of not believing what 
they hear, but of not hearing what's factual. <p>The great triumph of the political 
right in this country has been the creation of a network of alternative media. 
There are people who listen to Rush Limbaugh for more hours every day than the 
Branch Davidians listened to David Koresh. Watch Fox News, read The Washington 
Times -- hey, that's what the Bush administration does, according to its own words. 
<p>But it's not just the right-wing media purveying lies -- they are quoting the 
administration. These misimpressions come directly from the Bush administration, 
still, over and over.</p><p class="body" ALIGN="CENTER">&copy; 2004 Working for
