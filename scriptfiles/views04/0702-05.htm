<p>Anywhere you go in official Washington these days, you can hear tough truths about the catastrophic failures of President Bush and his team -- about how his bungling of the crucial war on terror put Americans in unprecedented danger in our homeland and overseas. 
<p>You hear these tough truths spoken loudly by Democrats. You hear them whispered by stalwart Republicans, who keep their voices down as their rage rises in frustration because they now feel trapped into cheering for a president they know is inept and a team they know is incompetent. You probably hear these tough truths spoken where you live, too, by people of all political persuasions. 

<p>But there is one place where you really haven't heard those tough truths spoken -- and that's any place Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry is speaking. That is too bad and quite sad. Because now more than ever in modern history the American people need and deserve to be told the tough but undeniable truths about the choice we face and the decision we must make on Election Day. 

<p>Here is a message Americans need to hear from the man who would be their next president: 

<p>"American citizens are in greater danger today than ever before -- in our homeland and anywhere in the world. Sadly, even tragically, we must put before the American people for their judgment in this campaign an indictment of failed leadership on the part of our incumbent president. 

<p>"President Bush must stand indicted in the court of public opinion because he willfully and recklessly pursued policies that diverted America's military forces and economic and diplomatic resources away from the war on terror before it was won. Somewhere along the line, he forgot who was America's Number One Enemy. 

<p>"We know our enemy. It is al-Qaida. The same terrorists who made it clear on September 11, 2001, that they are the sworn enemy of all Americans and the people of all nations that follow America's lead. After al-Qaida and its leader, Osama bin Laden, attacked the United States mainland, the world strongly backed President Bush when he began our war on terror by vowing to crush al-Qaida and all terrorists. The world cheered when U.S. forces toppled Afghanistan's Taliban regime that gave al-Qaida sanctuary. The president promised to stay the course in the war on terror. 

<p>"But President Bush veered dangerously off-course. He diverted our military forces and our economic and diplomatic resources before bin Laden had been captured and before al-Qaida had been crushed. He invaded Iraq to topple Saddam Hussein -- a dictator who has always been evil to his people but who had never attacked America's homeland. 

<p>"Studies by leading experts from some of the most hard-line think tanks have concluded that President Bush's policies gave al-Qaida the gift of time to regroup and recoup, and that his invasion of Iraq provided al-Qaida with a huge recruitment and fund-raising bonanza through much of the Middle East. 

<p>"The International Institute of Strategic Studies -- where President Bush gave the keynote address last year -- recently issued a report that concluded: 'Although half of al-Qaida's 30 senior leaders and perhaps 2,000 rank-and-file members have been killed or captured, a rump leadership is still intact and more than 18,000 potential terrorists are still at large, with recruitment accelerating on account of Iraq.' 

<p>"We began this election year of 2004 under a Code Orange state of high alert, issued by the Department of Homeland Security. U.S. intelligence experts believed al-Qaida had gotten so healthy that its terrorists might detonate a radioactive dirty bomb -- perhaps in New York City's Times Square on New Year's Eve. More than 130,000 troops are in Iraq and only 6,000 in Afghanistan, now mainly just a holding action. 

<p>"President Bush owes us all an answer to this question: If we had put 136,000 troops into Afghanistan and left Iraq until later, do you believe, as I do, that our fighting men and women are so skilled that they could have crushed al-Qaida and captured bin Laden? Do you believe as I do that we would be safer today if you had stayed the course in the war on terror? 

<p>"We cannot afford to all-but-ignore the enemy that still has us in his sights. We must mobilize a global coalition to pursue the original goal of the war on terror -- the all-out vanquishing of al-Qaida. It is the one Bush policy goal that, three years ago, had a world of support."
