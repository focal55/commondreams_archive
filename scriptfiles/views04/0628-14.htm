<p>What is going on among Iraq's working classes? We do not hear about 
those workers except for the high number of unemployed.

<p>Thanks to the <A HREF="http://www.thelaborparty.org" TARGET="_new">Labor Party Press</A>  we learn that 
George W. Bush's top representative in Iraq, Paul Bremer, continues to 
enforce Saddam Hussein's decree banning unions using military force 
where necessary.
Bush's coalition authority also would interpret "illegal" unions, 
demonstrations and strikes as inciting civil disorder which can result 
in the workers being arrested and treated as prisoners of war.

<p>Labor Party Press reports that Bremer has lowered Saddam Hussein's 
minimum wage and has cutoff the dictator's welfare benefits of housing 
and food. Ironic! All this is depriving and embittering millions of 
Iraqi families and increasing their sympathy for the insurgency. The Federation of Workers' Councils and Unions in Iraq (FWCUI) has been 
working to keep both the occupying soldiers and the insurgents from 
remaining inside the cities and residential areas.

<p>All kinds of political movements - secular and religious - are churning 
in Iraq. The secular populist associations - labor, women, self-help, 
civic - believe the U.S. occupation has attracted fundamentalist 
mobilizations from outside and inside the country.
There is now a Union of the Unemployed (UUI) that in the past year has 
enrolled 300,000 members. Their desire is to get some of the 300,000 
reconstruction jobs under the U.S. occupation. Apparently Labor Party 
Press reports UUI spokesman describing then meeting with the U.S. 
Coalition authority as follows:

<p>"We went in with out [membership] records in our hands, and they said 'Who are you? Who do you represent? You are nobody. We are the power here." Well, at least, that is the impression by the UUI of the reception they 
received. So they demonstrated in front of the Coalition's Palace, 
followed by a sit-in. Fifty of the demonstrators were arrested.

<p>Daily life is what concerns most Iraqis, not the politics of various 
religions and ethnic groups. The U.S. occupation still has not meet the 
people's needs for adequate water, food, cooking, oil and often 
electricity.

<p>Before Saddam came to power, with U.S. help in 1979, there used to be a 
strong labor movement. Now two union federations are emerging. American 
labor journalist David Bacon is reporting on the struggles of Iraqi 
workers to restore their jobs in the oil industry that U.S. companies 
like Halliburton were replacing with foreign workers. Teachers and women

workers are also engaging in labor activity, he says.
