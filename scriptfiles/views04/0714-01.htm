<p>Ian Spiers is ... a terrorist? 

<p>A threat to homeland security? A spy out to wreak havoc on the Ballard Bridge and Hiram Chittenden Locks?

<p>If Ian is any of these things then this is his weapon of mass destruction: a 35-millimeter Olympus camera.


<p>  
What recently happened to the longtime Ballard resident is one of those wrenching and uncomfortable stories of post-Sept. 11 America, and it is far from being black and white. 

<p>Try difficult shades of gray.

The whole thing would seem like a bad joke if the experience didn't leave Ian crushed and confused.

<p>Ian is an amateur photographer.

<p>In May he was taking photos for his Shoreline Community College class at the Ballard locks, where waves of tourists flock to take pictures and where no signs prohibit shutterbugging.

<p>Ian says he suddenly found himself surrounded by more than a half-dozen guys wearing black. He says they glowered, brusquely asked what he was doing and demanded his identification. 

  
 
<p>He tried to explain he was a photo student who had done nothing wrong and shouldn't have to show his ID. One of the men, Ian says, erupted: "See this badge! This is a federal badge! I'm with homeland security!"

<p>Intimidating tactics are one thing. A presumption that Ian -- who says he tried to be cooperative while not forfeiting his rights -- was guilty of something sinister is another. 

<p>What made the camera episode especially troubling for Ian, who was not arrested, is this: Other people around him happily toted cameras and clicked away, but he was the one singled out. 

<p>What gives?

<p>Here's a reasonable conclusion: Ian's skin color is to blame. 

<p>Someone saw him and saw no good. He was profiled.

<p>If you look at Ian's smooth, light-brown complexion you could jump to the conclusion that he is vaguely Middle Eastern looking or Latin, maybe even Muslim. 

<p>Put a camera in his hands and place him near federal property such as the locks and Ian transforms into, well, what else? A potential terrorist.

<p>"So upsetting," sums up Shoreline instructor Chris Simons, who taught Ian in Art 100 -- Beginning Photography.

<p>Ian, 36, is half Scottish, half African-American. He is a Christian Scientist who has lived in Ballard for 10 years. He chose to photograph near the locks and bridge because he knows those places well.

<p>Ian's camera trouble started even before the May incident. 

<p>In April he went near the locks to take snapshots and returned home. Before he knew it, he says two uniformed Seattle police officers were at his door. 

<p>"Were you just at the Ballard locks? Taking pictures?" he says one of the officers asked. 

<p>Ian said yes, said he was a student. Ian said he showed the officers his notebook with shutter speeds and aperture settings. 

<p>Had he done something wrong?

<p>The officers said no. Ian said they asked for his identification. 

<p>"If I've done nothing wrong why do I have to show identification," Ian asked them, feeling fear.

<p>A Seattle police report of the April incident described a man of medium skin tone acting "suspicious" at the locks and "photographing the bridge and writing notes."

<p>The officers who visited Ian took down his information and left. 

<p>On May 26, Ian returned to the locks to finish his class assignment. 

<p>He set up his tripod to take snapshots of passing boats. Within moments, he says a security guard -- with a gun at his side and a German shepherd -- was in front of him. The guard asked for ID. "I told him my constitutional rights were being infringed upon," Ian recalled during an emotional interview. 

<p>Ian said the guard walked away. 

<p>Next, Ian saw a Seattle police cruiser pull into the area, followed soon thereafter by several men donning black. They approached him.

<p>"Let's see some ID! Now," Ian says a uniform Seattle officer asked him. A federal special agent flashed his badge, huffed about being with homeland security and lectured about Sept. 11, Ian said. 

<p>Before leaving, Ian said the agent made a request: "You ought to let me take your picture."

<p>The photo student felt devastated. "The real threat to America," he said when we spoke, "is what I'm experiencing now."

<p>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, which owns and operates the locks, said they weren't involved in what happened. "Anyone who comes to the locks can take pictures," a spokeswoman said. "We want people to come."

<p>"Obviously someone saw something suspicious," says Seattle police spokeswoman Deanna Nolette. "The department has been asking people, should they see something suspicious, to call and report it."

<p>Leigh Winchell, a senior official for the Department of Homeland Security, paints a painful truth: "We have to respond to calls -- that's the day and age we live in. What would the public reaction be if we didn't follow through?"

<p>Yet, authorities should have an obligation to use their training and common sense to assess a situation. They should be able to quickly determine a student taking class photos from a terrorist. They should be able to do their job without resorting to intimidating swagger that leaves a grown man in tears.

<p>Authorities can ask folks for their IDs but people are not necessarily required to show them in a lot of situations. "This is one of them," says ACLU spokesman Doug Honig. "The justification they were citing doesn't apply to Ian." 

<p>The ACLU, which is following up on the case, obtained paperwork that explains why the folks with badges badgered Ian for identification. Basically, authorities used a law that cracks down on spies, Honig said. 

<p>But I don't think Ian's a spy. Ian loves America. Ian's crime was being a brown man with a camera in hand during a time of runaway fear. The law took action for the sake of the sockeye.
<p>Should we really feel any safer?
