<p>Unless cooler heads prevail, the American Medical Association is 
teetering on the brink of public ridicule, mockery and indignation. 
Resolution 202 has been introduced by Dr. J. Chris Hawk III from South 
Carolina to the AMA's Committee B. It is aimed directly at trial lawyers 
as patients.

<p>This resolution sets a new record for loss of sensitivity toward the 
tens of thousands of patients who die every year due to the gross 
negligence or incompetence called medical malpractice. This proposed 
resolution reflects the AMA's disappointment that the doctor's lobby has 
not adequately torpedoed the legal rights of these innocent plaintiffs 
in court. So it recommends major legal "surgery" that should turn the 
stomachs of more conscientious ethical and competent physicians than 
just gastroenterologists.

<p>Here are the chilling words: 
<p><i>"RESOLVED, That our American Medical 
Association notify physicians that, except in emergencies and except as 
otherwise required by law or other professional regulation, it is not 
unethical to refuse care to plaintiffs' attorneys and their spouses."
</i>
<p>Well at least the third generation Hawk left out the children.

<p>The chilling explanation by Dr. Hawk for this proposed resolution is 
that lawsuits against medical-practice mayhem raise malpractice 
insurance premiums "forcing physicians to reduce their scope of 
practice, relocate, and retire early." Therefore, he concludes, trial 
attorneys should be given "the opportunity to experience the access 
problems caused by the professional liability crisis," [and] then 
"perhaps they would be willing to help change the system."

<p>The main problem with this sadistic sequence of illogic is that it 
is false. The insurance companies are gouging the physicians by creating 
a phony crisis and playing off the natural desire of physicians never to 
be sued. Take all the premiums paid by doctors to insurance companies 
for malpractice coverage and divide the sum by all the practicing 
physicians. The premium would be about $10,000 a year -- a third of what 
they pay an experienced receptionist in their offices.

<p>Regulating insurance premiums to prevent over-classification of 
specialists (which jack up rates), promoting experience loss rating (so 
that the fewer bad doctors pay more than the competent doctors) and 
stiffening regulation by state licensing boards to focus on the 
chronically harmful physicians would help reduce the damage to innocent 
patients.

<p>Five percent of physicians account for about fifty percent of filed 
medical malpractice lawsuits. The total amount paid out in verdicts and 
settlements in all malpractice lawsuits is between $5 and $6 billion -- 
less than the amount spent just on dog food in this country. Only ten 
percent of medical malpractice victims even file a claim

<p>Yet according to the Harvard School of Public Health Physicians, 80,000 
Americans die every year from medical negligence or worse just in 
hospitals alone. Hundreds of thousands are significantly injured. By 
comparison with the insurance premiums paid, one of the Harvard 
physicians estimated the cost of medical malpractice casualties to be 
over $60 billion a year.

<p>Dr. Hawk III's narrow frame of reference must have precluded him from 
reading the data and studies that contradict his precipitous attempt to 
embrace the AMA with a sordid display of unethical recommendations. He 
should log onto the websites <a href="http://www.Citizen.org" target="_new">Citizen.org</a> and <a href="http://www.Centerjd.org" target="_new">Centerjd.org</a> for his 
enlightenment (the web sites include data countering the allegation that 
doctors are abandoning their practice).

<p>It would be nice to refer him to an AMA website on medical malpractice 
and what his organization is doing about this preventable violence. But 
there is none. The AMA is oblivious, showing no interest in this 
nationwide tragedy.

<p>Dr. Hawk III's proposed resolution goes to Committee B and, if approved, 
will go to the American Medical Association's House of Delegates for 
deliberation. Let Americans see how out of touch the AMA is with reality 
and how subservient to the insurance industry they continue to be.
