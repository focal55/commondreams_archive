'Such morbid exultation King would have denounced.''They got Zorro. They finally got that son of a bitch." <BR>
<BR>
 These words of ecstasy fell from the lips of FBI agent Jim Rose upon hearing that a .30-06-caliber rifle slug had shattered the right jaw and severed the spinal cord of the Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr., killing him instantly. Special Agent Rose uttered these words about the black leader to his colleague Arthur Murtagh in the FBI parking lot in Atlanta.<BR>
<BR>
 "When King was shot," Murtagh told me years ago, "&#91;Rose&#93; went on a thirty-minute high." The bureau was under the control of Director J. Edgar Hoover who - in a personal vendetta - targeted King as the civil rights leader who must be removed from the scene.<BR>
<BR>
 Despite denials, Hoover agents and informers were at King's elbow until the moment of his very last breadth. One of them measured King's very last pulse and established for the FBI the official version of the trajectory of the death slug. History has shown that it is very likely Hoover's men were also well informed and active as well on the originating end of the trajectory of the bullet that killed King.<BR>
<BR>
 When Murtagh informed me of the parking-lot ecstasy of his fellow agent at King's assassination, I dutifully broke the story to Newsday readers. This revelation sent a shiver of excitement throughout the community of conspiracy theorists grasping at straws. Pilfered disclosures from my investigation were used to jumpstart a U.S. congressional investigation and Mark Lane and Dick Gregory wrote a book "Code-Name 'Zorro': The Murder of Martin Luther King, Jr."<BR>
<BR>
 The wise among King's nonviolent followers surmised that Hoover wanted him eliminated. Still, it was one thing to suspect a government gone murderous and quite another to confirm it. Murtagh's revelation about the FBI's mind-set affected me beyond the professional requirements of verifying facts.<BR>
<BR>
 I remembered where I was that terrible Thursday when Sen. Robert Kennedy interrupted a concert to announce that King had been shot dead in Memphis. In violation of military rules, I attached a black ribbon to my U.S. Army uniform the next day and openly defied ranking officers. Had blacks not committed those acts of insurrection that April 4 night, the very Hound of Heaven would have wondered what manner of people King had chosen to lead.<BR>
<BR>
 This response stood in sharp relief to Rose's joyful glee. The lesson may be no larger than the division among those observing an ox being slaughtered, no matter how unjustified or gory.<BR>
<BR>
 In the Iraq war that the nonviolent King would never have approved, one is moved to consider the needless squandering of U.S. credibility and resources and the mounting loss of life. There appears also to be a subtle corruption of the spirit of fair play, even under conditions of war. One might ponder the widespread gloating over the July killing of the two sons of Saddam Hussein, along with a 14-year-old and a bodyguard. <BR>
<BR>
 With a $15-million bounty on each of their heads, the brothers were gunned down allegedly in a "fierce gun battle." They were up against the 101st Airborne Division armed with limitless anti-tank rockets and supported by Apache helicopters, a pack of A-10 Warthogs belching death fire, and a squadron of impatient laser-smart jet fighters. Pulled from the house the U.S. firepower had shredded like a termite mound, the playboy sadist, Uday, and his more sedate brother, Qusay, were displayed in the full-color bloom of blood and gore as front-page trophies for President George W. Bush's den.<BR>
<BR>
 The cowboy swagger of the president was palpable in its exuberance. "It was a good day for the White House," an analyst for the Council on Foreign Relations told Newsday. The Hussein opposition celebrated in Iraq. However, a correspondent for al-Jazeera, the Arab satellite television network that has been a staunch critic of the war, described the two Hussein brothers as having been killed "in cold blood" and one analyst on the network called the method of their deaths a "crime."<BR>
<BR>
 This space wondered at the time whether Americans were embarrassed by the Bush administration's release of those photographs. Or whether they were repulsed by their government hiring assassins to hunt down fugitives as if the world's lone superpower is some tin-horned, nuclear-crazed vigilante state. Or whether, alas, the White House had lost its Wild West, bounty-hunting mind.<BR>
<BR>
 My mail suggested that the Hussein brothers, their bodyguard and the Iraqi teenager were oxen that Americans should not care about, even though soldiers had gored them bloody and celebrated over their corpses. Such morbid exultation King would have denounced. <BR>
<BR>
 Last week in Fallujah, several other oxen were gored and burned and strung up on a bridge over the Euphrates River. This time, the gloating is on the other face <BR>
<BR>
 It is the White House's turn to take the next eye-for-an-eye in its mad march to blindness.
