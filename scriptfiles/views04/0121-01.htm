<p>CARQUEFOU, FRANCE -- Why do they hate us? And where do they get their hatred from? 


<p>These questions haunted me and three other American visitors as we studied a huge display of cartoons drawn by local schoolchildren assigned to convey their impressions of the United States. Panel after grisly panel depicted the United States, George Bush and those ubiquitous symbols of American commercial culture--McDonald's and Coke--as murderous, predatory and gleefully vicious. Obese Uncle Sams chopping up Iraqi children with a knife, their blood gushing across construction paper. A leering Statue of Liberty holding a hamburger in one hand while firing missiles at dying Afghan civilians across the ocean. The American flag, its bars transformed into prisons for the child inmates of Guantánamo. A baseball bat painted red, white and blue poised to smash a ball--which is a globe. The juxtaposition between the artwork's ferociously angry imagery and the childish drawing styles of the third graders would disturb the most jaded reader. 


<p>I didn't see a single positive portrayal of the U.S. 


<p>Organizers of Carquefou's annual cartoon art festival had invited four American artists--Steve Benson of The Arizona Republic, David Horsey of The Seattle Post-Intelligencer, Kal of The Baltimore Sun and yours truly--to this industrial town in conservative western France to discuss the deteriorated state of Franco-American relations. We've all used our cartoons to convey our dim opinion of the Bush Administration's domestic and foreign policy agenda. We oppose the war in Iraq (news - web sites). We despise the French bashing ("freedom fries," wine boycotts, high schools that have stopped teaching French) that has arisen since the Chirac government threatened to veto Bush's Iraq war resolution in the U.N. I even have dual French-American citizenship. We're a pretty liberal group; that's probably why they chose us. 


<p>We don't take issue with most of the cartoons' messages. They see Bush as a vicious, thoughtless warmonger with fascist tendencies, Americans as arrogant brutes who don't give a passing thought to the innocent people who die at the hands of their government and rapacious corporations as hegemonic steamrollers that crush cultural distinctiveness and independence in their ceaseless quest for the almighty dollar. They can't believe that we feel more entitled to use military force than Luxembourg or Monaco. 


<p>What must Palestinian kids think of us? 


<p>It would be nice to see these opinions expressed with more subtlety and nuance. But their opinions are more right than wrong. Americans believe they're exceptional. A Republican is someone who believes that we were right to invade Iraq. A Democrat is one who thinks we should have gone into Rwanda. 


<p>Still, walking past those drawings these past few days felt like getting slugged in the stomach. Part of it was the sheer scale--there were more than 700 pieces on display. But the level of rage and vitriol against America and everything related to it (one kid even trashed Tropicana orange juice) surpassed prewar propaganda in Saddam's Iraqi press. And these are kids. What a difference a hundred years makes: the Statue of Liberty, France's second great gift to America after freeing it from England, was funded by millions of centimes collected by French schoolchildren. 


<p>We repeatedly explained that there's more to the United States than George Bush. We pointed out that most voters supported Gore in the last election, that hundreds of thousands of Americans marched against the war. We argued that Americans are kind, big-hearted people. French attendees listened politely, and we were treated with the utmost kindness and hospitality, but their kids' cartoons screamed: we hate you. That hurt. 


<p>Children get their politics from their parents and teachers, who form their impressions from the media. The European media has covered a different war than the one you've seen on CNN and Fox News. A 14-year-old Iraqi boy, shot by U.S. troops in Baghdad, was interviewed for five minutes on the evening news. "They did it on purpose," he said. "They were laughing." The bloody corpses of Iraqi civilians are standard TV fare here. The Bush Administration is routinely portrayed as greedy, stupid and mean. 


<p>Americans can find the truth about our nasty, unwinnable oil war, but they have to dig a little deeper. "The United States is using excessive power," Ghazi Ajil al-Yawar, a moderate, pro-American member of the Iraqi Governing Council, told The New York Times Magazine on January 11. "They round up people in a very humiliating way, by putting bags over their faces in front of their families. In our society, this is like rape. The Americans are using collective punishment by jailing relatives. What is the difference from Saddam? They are demolishing houses [of insurgents' family members] now. They say they want to teach a lesson to the people. But when Timothy McVeigh (news - web sites) was convicted in the bombing in Oklahoma City, was his family's home destroyed?" 


<p>It's striking that al-Yawar knows McVeigh's name. How many Americans can identify any Iraqi other than Saddam Hussein (news - web sites)? Most foreigners know more about us than we know about them. Hell, they know more about what we're doing in Iraq than we do ourselves. 


<p>Of course, many of us don't give a damn whether French schoolchildren or anyone else think Bush's United States is a land of butchers and thugs. Whether or not we care, however, it matters.
