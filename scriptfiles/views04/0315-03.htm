<p>Just in case you think our leaders in Washington don't have their priorities straight, there's this news item that recently ran on the wire: 

<p>"While some officers of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security work overtime to thwart terrorists intent on using planes as weapons of mass destruction, their colleagues have been intensely monitoring Americans suspected of attempting to vacation in Cuba." 

<p>Apparently, trips to Fidel Castro's land have become a new obsession for the Bush people. 

<p>Last Oct. 10, the president signed a directive that prompted Tom Ridge's Department of Homeland Security to devote extra resources to more intensively inspect passengers who travel to Cuba on daily charter flights from Miami, New York and San Francisco. 

<p>"Homeland Security and the Department of Foreign Assets Control officers are interrogating - or interviewing, depending on your point of view - everyone both on the way out and on return," Bob Guild of Marazul Charters, a travel agent that arranges trips with legal exemptions to the ongoing U.S. travel ban, told the service. 

<p>Folks can legally go to Cuba for bona fide business or educational purposes if they obtain a permit from the State Department. Otherwise, it's illegal for U.S. citizens to visit the communist nation, particularly for nefarious reasons, like simply lying around, soaking up the sun. 

<p>And, what have been the fruits of this crackdown? 

<p>Of some 45,461 travelers, Homeland Security reports, 215 have been charged with attempting to vacation in Cuba. 

<p>But, wait, there's more. 

<p>Out of the remaining 45,246, another 283 have been charged with alcohol and tobacco violations, which were uncovered by the Homeland Security sleuths. 

<p>Did they catch these folks bringing in big stashes of drugs or booze? 

<p>Well, no, Homeland Security's spokeswoman Christiana Halsey confessed. 

<p>Actually each of those 283 violations involved a small amount of rum or worse - those dreaded Cuban cigars - "found on a person." 

<p>Our taxpayers' dollars at work.
