Five weeks ago, Walt Bourdot, 80, posted a bumper-style sticker on the outside of his Redwood Terrace apartment door. It read:
<P>
<B> &quot;DEFEND AMERICA DEFEAT BUSH.&quot;</B>
<P> Some, but by no means all, of the doors and recessed doorways at the 25-year-old Escondido retirement community are decorated in some personal fashion. A few display crosses or religious messages (&quot;Let the hearts of those rejoice who see the Lord&quot;). During the holiday season, wreaths are pinned to the doors. Following 9/11, patriotic flags blossomed.
<P>
Shortly after it went up, Bourdot&#39;s sign was ripped off and another was put in its place. It read:
<P>
<B> &quot;KERRY IS A (expletive).&quot;</B>
<P>
Not one to shy away from a conflict, Bourdot, a war veteran, pasted up another sticker: <B>DEFEND AMERICA DEFEAT BUSH</B>.
<P>
In short order, the unknown vandal changed the Democratic message, replacing Bush&#39;s name with Kerry&#39;s.
<P>
Meanwhile, Russ Stevens, a retired chairman of San Diego State University&#39;s psychology department, had joined forces with Bourdot and posted <B>DEFEND AMERICA DEFEAT BUSH </B>on his door. His sticker received the same alteration as Bourdot&#39;s.
<P>
In full throat, Stevens, 79, tacked up a broadside on his door. It read:
<P>
<B>&quot;BUSH &amp; CO MUST GO! (THAT IS A MINORITY OPINION HERE AT REDWOOD TERRACE BUT IT DESERVES RESPECT.) AMERICA IS NOT YET A TOTALITARIAN STATE, SO YOU ARE FREE TO POST YOUR OWN VIEWS IN THIS ELECTION YEAR. PLEASE RESPECT OURS AND TRY NOT TO ACT LIKE A FASCIST THUG. KEEP YOUR HANDS OFF THIS NOTICE!&quot;</B>
<B></B>
<P>
On Sept. 8, a memorandum was sent to the (roughly) 160 residents of Redwood Terrace. It began:
<P>
&quot;The Residents&#39; Council was asked to create an ad hoc subcommittee to compose a statement regarding residents&#39; political statements that are posted where they can be seen and/or defaced by others.&quot;
<P>
The notice went on to declare that the handiwork of the committee had been approved by Southern California Presbyterian Homes, the nonprofit corporation that operates Redwood Terrace. As a result, the following passage will be entered into the community&#39;s official handbook:
<P>
&quot;The entrance door and doorway walls to the resident&#39;s living unit may be decorated as the resident chooses. However, all decorations, in whatever form, must conform to acceptable standards as established by the Residents&#39; Council.
<P>
&quot;Decorations should maintain the integrity of the door/doorway walls, not present a safety hazard, be in keeping with the general good appearance of the area and contribute to community harmony and good will. Solicitations posted on entry doors/doorway walls, including political statements of any type, are considered as not meeting acceptable standards.&quot;
<P>
Dan Ogus, Redwood Terrace&#39;s director, told me that the decision to ban political expressions from the public hallways rested solely with the Residents&#39; Council. He likened it to changing the dress code in the dining room.

<P>
<P>
Bourdot &amp; Stevens felt blindsided by a subcommittee of unknown composition. They doubted if anyone had advocated for them.
<P>
In a letter to the council, Bourdot wrote, &quot;It&#39;s ludicrous to fear that free speech will have a detrimental impact on community harmony and good will. Is this not a significant election year, and aren&#39;t we all educated, intelligent adults? Can we tolerate differences of opinion?&quot;
<P>
In his letter, Stevens wrote, &quot;People of good will welcome dissent, disagree without being disagreeable and, when necessary, cordially agree to disagree. Unwarranted prior restraint merely papers over our differences, yielding an artificial, illusory equanimity. I do not intend to honor such restraints.&quot;
<P>
During a recent tour of Redwood Terrace, Stevens appeared willing to let the controversy go. Bourdot, on the other hand, remains defiant.
<P>
&quot;I&#39;m not taking it down,&quot; he said of his campaign sticker, which remains on his door. &quot;I guess I&#39;m pig-headed.&quot;
<P>
It&#39;s anyone&#39;s guess how his civil disobedience will play out at Redwood Terrace.
<P>
A call to the American Civil Liberties Union confirmed that renters, unlike home and condo owners, have no legal right to express political beliefs on their doors or windows.
<P>
The issue here isn&#39;t the letter of the law. On that score, the retired engineer doesn&#39;t have a leg to stand on as he maneuvers around his apartment with a walker.
<P>
No, the issue  in a retirement community, at Cal State San Marcos or in the nation as a whole  is how far to go to preserve harmony and good will during a political campaign that sends blood pressures soaring.
