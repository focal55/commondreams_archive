<p>Ralph Nader should not have any trouble getting on the November presidential ballot in Wisconsin.


<p>Unlike many other states, Wisconsin has historically erred on the side of electoral competition. Thus, while some states require more than 100,000 signatures and force candidates to jump through one bureaucratic hoop after another to attain ballot status, the Badger State asks simply that supporters of a candidate gather 2,000 signatures from Wisconsinites who are eligible to vote.

<p>And once the signatures are filed, the state Board of Elections has a history of making every effort to get names on the ballot - indeed, no one can remember the last time a serious presidential campaign failed to qualify.

<p>In other words, if backers of Nader's independent presidential campaign make a basic effort to collect a couple thousand valid signatures and then submit them by the Sept. 7 deadline, it is extremely unlikely that anything will prevent the consumer activist's name from appearing on the Wisconsin ballot for the third time in as many presidential elections.

<p>So why is Nader's Wisconsin field coordinator, Bill Linville, making such a big deal about how difficult it may be for the campaign to achieve ballot status in one of the most electorally open and easy states in the country?

<p>Linville says he fears the state Democratic Party will attempt to strike Nader from the ballot, as has happened in some other states. But that's improbable. The leaders of the Wisconsin Democratic Party have said they won't try to disqualify Nader. They're not being noble, just smart; Wisconsinites don't approve of candidates or parties that try to get ahead by extracting opponents from the ballot.

<p>Even if the Democrats did make an effort to knock Nader out, they would probably fail, as the bar for achieving ballot status is set so low and the state Board of Elections is so flexible that it is doubtful Democrats could find a legitimate - let alone successful - excuse for disqualifying the independent candidate.So what's the real reason that the Nader camp is fretting?

<p>The answer may have something to do with the fact that the Wisconsinites who were with Nader in the past are not backing him this year. In 1996 and 2000, Nader's candidacy in Wisconsin benefited from the enthusiastic backing of a cadre of politically savvy Green Party activists. This year, the Greens are backing the anti-war, anti-corporate candidacy of David Cobb, who beat back an effort by Nader supporters to secure a Green Party endorsement for the man the party backed twice for the presidency.

<p>Nader ran best in 1996 and 2000 in regions of Wisconsin where the Greens are strongest, including Dane County and the state's far north.

<p>Nader's efforts in the Madison area this year will suffer, as well, because Progressive Dane is not backing him. That political organization, which has been highly successful in electing candidates to the Madison City Council, Dane County Board and Madison School Board, endorsed Nader in 2000 and added a good deal of energy and political credibility to his efforts in the region.

<p>So, to a much greater extent than in the past, Nader is on his own this year. He has paid staffers to coordinate his efforts in states such as Wisconsin, but he lacks the volunteer base that the Greens and Progressive Dane provided here.

<p>With the energy and street smarts of the Green and Progressive Dane volunteers, Nader would be assured of ballot status. Even without their support, he is likely to qualify. But getting on the ballot, in Wisconsin at least, is the easy part. Lacking the broad support he had in 2000, Nader is unlikely to mount anywhere near so credible a Wisconsin campaign this fall as he did in 1996 or 2000 - and that, undoubtedly, is what has his aides spooked.
