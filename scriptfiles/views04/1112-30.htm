<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><P>MITCHELL, S.D. — His home state and his country are about to recognize that George McGovern was way ahead of the times about Vietnam more than 30 years ago.<P>

A conference here this week at his alma mater, Dakota Wesleyan University, previewed the George and Eleanor McGovern Library and Center for Public Service. Groundbreaking is expected next year for the $8.5 million project, although about $1.5 million more still must be raised from McGovernites nationwide before the first shovel can be turned.<P>

In case you've forgotten, here's the pungent punishment we gave McGovern because he preached against our Vietnam fiasco years before the rest of us got it:<P>

As the Democratic candidate for president in 1972, he was wiped out by Richard Nixon. The popular vote: 47.1 million to 29.1 million.

<P>His home state of South Dakota not only voted against him for president, but later threw him out of the U.S. Senate.

<P>Often taunted but undaunted, McGovern kept up his campaign for world peace. <P>His latest target: The Israelis and Palestinians. His solution: Force Israel to withdraw from all of the land it took in 1967 and help the Palestinians create an independent state there.

His method: Have President Bush appoint two former presidents — Republican Bush Sr. and Democrat Jimmy Carter — to preside over a meeting between Israeli leaders and Yasser Arafat's successor at Camp David and keep them there until they agree to such a deal.<P>

"A solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict would do more to end the terrorist threat than keeping our troops in Iraq," McGovern says. He may again be ahead of the times. A la Vietnam.
