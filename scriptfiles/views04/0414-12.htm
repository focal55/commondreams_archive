<p>In my dream, George W. Bush looks directly into the camera and intones, “Mah fella Amuricans,” and resigns from the presidency. His vice president, even more deeply mired in scandal than Bush, resigns as well. The Speaker of the House, Dennis Hastert, takes his place as the next in line according to the Constitution but suffering from a severe charisma deficit, he loses the election to John Kerry.  Sigh. Dream on. This president, unlike his fellow Texan who resigned from the presidency in 1968, has such hubris that he will bring down the country before he admits to wrong-doing.

<p>Even though the 9/11 Commission has been steadily revealing President George W. Bush’s bare bum, the only evidence of his discomfort is his concession to hold the third press conference of his tenure as president. Employing the same tactic that his National Security Adviser, Condoleezza Rice did when she testified before the 9/11 Commission, he “stayed on message,” deftly avoiding direct answers to the press corps’ questions. His opponents may be rubbing their hands with pleasure at the spectacle of Bush finally being caught out but make no mistake: Don’t assume that Kerry is going to win the election easily; if you do, you are underestimating W’s personal charisma. 

<p>If you believe that the 9/11 Commission hearings are destroying Bush’s chances for re-election, consult http://www.vote.com/  Following Condi Rice’s testimony, 77% of the respondents believed that she “provided thorough explanations” for the administration’s inaction before the attacks. Eighty-three percent of the respondents disagreed with the contention that the August 6, 2001 memo was proof that Bush could have prevented the attacks. I predict that when the post-presidential news conference question is posted, 82% will say that the president answered all the press’s questions thoroughly even though they never elicited a decent answer from him. 

<p>There are many reasons for this willingness to believe the Charlatan-in-Chief.  For one thing, we are conditioned to trust the President no matter who the occupant of the office is. The disgraced Richard M. Nixon had an unshakeable core of supporters who stayed with him even as his helicopter lifted off the White House helipad. They can still be seen occasionally on talk shows, defending his honor and insisting that the Watergate scandal was a put-up job by the Democrats. 

<p>Secondly, the American people value loyalty almost above all else. I call it the “our sonofabitch rule,” in other words, he may be a son-of-a-bitch, but he’s OUR son of a bitch.

<p>For another thing, politics in America is not about issues, not even about those that affect us personally in very significant ways: the lack of affordable health care; the deaths of over 700 American soldiers in a war that we were deceived into supporting; the impending loss of social security; the loss of millions of American jobs due to globalization and outsourcing.  Instead, we focus on the personal: Bill Clinton’s dalliances in the Oval Office itself; George Bush’s apparent slow-wittedness; Al Gore’s wooden public persona. The result is that we ignore the public sins we should censure, condemn the private behavior that is really none of our business, and we chose our leaders based on superficial qualities. 

<p>During the 2000 election campaign, NPR journalists spoke to potential voters around the country. When a coffee shop customer said that he wanted a president that he could talk to over a cup of coffee, I felt my chest tighten into a knot. It was an omen: For all his gifts, Al Gore was not the sort of guy  with whom most voters from middle America would feel comfortable sharing a cup of coffee.  But what criteria is that for choosing a president? A man (or someday, a woman) who could send our sons and daughters into battle; who could cut out our safety net for our old age; who could, by executive order, declare our armed forces accepting of openly gay troops?  In an age when so much depends on one’s ability to communicate effectively, does it make any sense to elect a man with a CEO mentality and an outstanding ability to glad-hand without the  corresponding ability to explain his actions to the voters or the world? 

<p>This desire to have a friendly, accessible leader points to a puzzling provincialism among American voters. As the only superpower, we are citizens of the world, but our citizens distrust and undervalue intellectual achievement, and generally do not elect people they perceive as being smarter than they are. People like Al Gore are derided as “policy wonks.”  Bill Clinton’s undeniable intellectual gifts were masked by his good old boy ways.  This anti-intellectualism runs so deep that many politicians pretend to be less intellectual than they really are. 

<p>Television has made things worse. Now politicians have to be friendly AND good-looking. John F. Kennedy was more handsome and poised before the televisions cameras than the nervous, scowling Richard M. Nixon with the five o’clock shadow.  If the late Senator Paul Simon of Illinois or Rep. Dennis Kucinich of Ohio had been tall and handsome, they might have had a better shot at the presidency that they coveted. 

<p>Worst of all, the issues which are a matter of life and death are politicized by a cult of personality. George W. Bush’s attitude is that you are either for him or against him, so if you support the Kyoto agreement on Global Warming, then you’re against him. 

<p>Ambassador Joseph C Wilson 4th, contradicted Bush’s claim in his State of the Union address that Saddam Hussein had bought uranium from Niger. "I have little choice,” he wrote in the New York Times, “but to conclude that some of the intelligence related to Iraq's nuclear weapons programme was twisted to exaggerate the Iraqi threat,”  Bush  retaliated by leaking to the press the information that Wilson’s spouse, Valerie Plame, was a CIA operative. Exposing the identity of a CIA agent is a federal crime. It is currently under investigation. 

<p>Abraham Lincoln said that “You can't fool all of the people, all of the time.” In this era of true believers, however, many Americans are willingly fooling themselves.  Thirty-three percent believe that the we have actually found weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. Almost 25% believe that the Iraqis have used chemical or biological weapons against other nations. Half of those polled believe that there were Iraqis among the nineteen hijackers on September 11, 2001. As H.L Mencken said, "No one ever went broke underestimating the intelligence of the American people."
