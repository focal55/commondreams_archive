<p>We're told that President Bush watched the television news coverage of the Iraqi mob that attacked, burned and mutilated four American civilians in Falluja on Wednesday. I can imagine the fury he must have felt. But I wonder what specific thoughts ran through his mind, and what other emotions he experienced.

<p>Was there any soul-searching, any second thoughts about whether he did the right thing in launching this war, which he thought was all but over last May but which remains with us, with no end to the carnage in sight? With so many now dead, might the president have felt even the mildest of qualms, the faintest flickering of regret while watching the hideous images from Falluja?

<p>If you talk to the troops who have served in Iraq, you can only marvel at their bravery and commitment to duty, and the lack of bellyaching at the difficult hands they were dealt. I've interviewed several servicemen and servicewomen who have returned from the war zone, including some who were horribly wounded, and I've yet to hear one of them utter any variation of the complaint, "Why me?"

<p>But I inevitably come away from these conversations asking the question for them. Why were they ever placed in harm's way in Iraq? Wednesday's atrocity was inexcusable — unconscionable — and those responsible should be tracked down and punished. But even if that happens, the greater tragedy of the war itself will continue indefinitely.

<p>We rode into this wholly unnecessary conflict on the wave of Mr. Bush's obsession with Saddam Hussein and Iraq, and we've made a hash of it. Hundreds of Americans and thousands of innocent Iraqis have died for reasons the administration has never been able to coherently explain.

<p>Last May 1, in a fun moment for the commander in chief, Mr. Bush sat in the co-pilot's seat as an S-3B Viking aircraft landed on the deck of the carrier Abraham Lincoln. The president was in full flying regalia: flight suit, parachute, water survival kit. "Yes," he told reporters, "I flew it."

<p>The president's giddily choreographed "Top Gun" spectacle was designed to take full public relations advantage of his triumphant announcement that "major combat operations in Iraq" had ended.

<p>He was wrong, of course, just as he was wrong about the weapons of mass destruction, and about the number of troops that would be needed to secure Iraq, and so many other things. In fact, the Bush administration has managed to conceal any and all evidence that it knows the first thing about what it's doing in Iraq.

<p>When the Army chief of staff, Gen. Eric Shinseki, dared to say publicly that several hundred thousand troops would be needed to occupy Iraq, he was ridiculed by the administration and his career was brought to a close. When Mr. Bush's former Treasury secretary, Paul O'Neill, disclosed that planning for an invasion of Iraq was already under way in early 2001, he was denounced as someone who didn't know what he was talking about. And there's hardly a serious person in the country who is unaware of the administration's sliming of Richard Clarke, who said, among other things, that the war in Iraq had undermined the war against terror.

<p>There were 4,000 marines stationed near Falluja when Wednesday's gruesome attack occurred. But Marine commanders, as The Times's Jeffrey Gettleman reports, decided they would not intervene to stop the mutilation of the bodies. The atrocity unfolded without interference.

<p>On that same day five soldiers were killed when their convoy rolled over a bomb buried in the road in a town 15 miles west of Falluja. A major trade show in Baghdad that was supposed to be held next week to showcase investment opportunities in the new Iraq had to be postponed yesterday because of security concerns.

<p>We are mired in a savage mess in Iraq, and no one knows how to get out of it. More than 600 U.S. troops are already dead. The rest of the world has decided that this is an American show, so we're not getting much in the way of help. (Even the Saudis have been sticking their fingers in Uncle Sam's eye, leading the effort by OPEC to cut oil production.) President Bush won't come clean about the financial costs of the war. His mantra remains: tax cuts, tax cuts.

<p>We're flying blind. There's no evidence that the president or anyone in his administration knows what the next act of this great tragedy will be. <p ALIGN="CENTER">Copyright 2004 The New York Times Company
