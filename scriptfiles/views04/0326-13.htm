<p>I'm tired of hearing the Democrats rail against Ralph Nader.  As a 2000 
Nader voter, I'm tired of having the Democrats condemn me, blackmail me, 
imply that I've been duped, and suggest I have no alternative but to shut up 
and vote for them.  As recently as Thursday night at a Democratic funding 
raising dinner President Jimmy Carter said, in a statement directed at Ralph 
Nader, "Don't risk costing the Democrats the White House this year as you 
did four years ago." This type of scapegoat does not make me feel all warm 
and fuzzy about voting for John Kerry and the Democrats.

<p>Carter also said  "I hope everyone here tonight will do your best to make 
sure Ralph Nader gets zero votes this year."

<p>There is a very simple way to insure that Ralph Nader gets zero votes this 
year:  support his positions.  If Senator Kerry supported even a few of 
Nader's positions I would vote for him.  Usually I vote for the person whose 
positions and votes reflect my own views. Unfortunately for Democrats, John 
Kerry can't run on his voting record.  Kerry rolled over for the Republicans 
and voted with the current Administrative on much of the legislation the 
left opposed: the Patriot Act, the "No Child Left Behind" Act, NAFTA, and 
the act giving Bush authority to attack Iraq, among others.

<p>I might even forgive these votes if he held progressive views today.  But, 
alas, he does not.  Take his stand on the war in Iraq.  He's not willing to 
commit to bringing the troops home.  Instead, he gives vague statements 
about getting the UN involved and rapidly passing power over to the Iraqis.

<p>As with many prior Democratic presidential candidates, I fully expect to see 
Kerry move to the right as we get closer to the election. We can see this 
kind of movement in a speech Kerry made on March 19th when he condemned Hugh 
Chavez, the democratically elected President of Venezuela.  Candidate Kerry 
characterized Chavez's policies as "detrimental to our interests" and 
suggested he was undermining Venezuela's democracy as well as supporting 
Columbian rebels.  Kerry singled out Chavez's friendship with Fidel Castro 
for special condemnation and accused him of impeding a recall referendum.  
Prior to this, news reports suggested Chavez was trying to court a 
friendship with Kerry.

<p>So what are Chavez's real crimes?  He's undertaken a land reform in 
Venezuela, giving idle lands to poor peasants; many of these lands were 
previously under the jurisdiction of large plantation owners.  Also, he's 
taken on big oil interests by passing laws that doubled the royalty taxes 
paid by oil operators and he's asserted control over the state owned state 
oil company, which was previously controlled by foreign oil interests.  It's 
telling that one of the few places you can find the full text of Kerry's 
speech is on Petroleum World website 
(<a href="http://www.petroleumworld.com/Edit4Mar24.htm" target="_new">http://www.petroleumworld.com/Edit4Mar24.htm</a>).

<p>I would doubt the majority of Americans know who Hugh Chavez is or care 
about America's relationship with him.  If this speech is not earning Kerry 
points with the voters, why is he making it?   It's a wink and a nod at the 
wealthy and the corporations who have business interests in Venezuela.  
Through this speech he's implying that while he might take left stances in 
public, he's really siding with big corporate interests just like Bush. So it's up to you, Senator Kerry.  What's it to be?  Do you want my vote or 
do you want to continue courting corporations and the wealthy?  Either way 
the Democratic Party ought to stop blaming Nader for their own failures.
