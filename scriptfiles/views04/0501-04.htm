<p>GEORGE Bush and Tony Blair lied and lied and lied. September 11, the murder of more than 3,000 innocent New Yorkers, was the worst single act of terrorism in human history.</p>
<p>But Saddam Hussein had nothing to do with it.</p>
<p>And neither, as we now exhaustively know, did he pose any threat to the West.</p>
<p>Those fabled weapons of mass destruction, WMD, the 45 minutes from doomsday scenarios laid out by Downing Street, turned out to be just that - fables.</p>
<p>All the fancy charts, the briefings, the spin, the secret, secret intelligence was all a big fix to justify George W Bush's revenge on a nasty but pathetic Middle Eastern dictator whose regime was sinking into the sands of the Iraqi desert.</p>
<p>Bush's War on Terror was a load of baloney.</p>
<p>Bush said Saddam Hussein was part of the "axis of evil", a rogue regime that would bring death and destruction to Western cities.</p>
<p>Do you remember how they rammed it down our throats?</p>
<p>YOU could not turn on the television without seeing platoons of soldiers donning their gas masks and jumping into rubber suits.</p>
<p>We spent our nights lying in bed worrying about the wind dispersal rates of anthrax, sarin and mustard gas. Or what cyanide gas, the smell of almonds, would do to us on the Tube.</p>
<p>The message was implicit. Saddam Hussein had to be stopped NOW before he brought death and destruction to the West.</p>
<p>But the real axis of evil lies far closer to home, right in the Oval Office. It lies in the blind prejudice of men like US Vice President Dick Cheney, US Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and his deputy Paul Wolfowitz.</p>
<p>Men who believed America, the sole and triumphant superpower, had the right to change the world at a whim.</p>
<p>Clever, shadowy men who manipulated a fool of a President into unleashing a Pandora's Box of endless war that really does now threaten the entire world.</p>
<p>For those hardline American neo-conservatives September 11 was not a tragedy, it was an opportunity to unleash America's legions on the Middle East.</p>
<p>America had been attacked and now was the hour to strike back and finish the job that Bush's father had failed to do in the first 1991 Gulf War.</p>
<p>Saddam Hussein, a thug, a murderous, brutal psychopath and a defiant Arab, was the ideal candidate for lesson Numero Uno in American firepower.</p>
<p>The fact that Saddam had nothing to do with al-Qaeda or Osama bin Laden or the September 11 hijackers was immaterial.</p>
<p>It was the United States, not the UN, the European Union or anyone else, who would determine the fate of the world.</p>
<p>Anyone who opposed the madness of this unnecessary war, the French and the Germans, were cowards and traitors.</p>
<p>French fries were banned in patriotic Washington restaurants.</p>
<p>To his eternal shame Tony Blair cravenly went along with the American plan just so we could get a pat on the head and a seat at the big table with our American bosses.</p>
<p>Obviously there had to be an excuse to attack Iraq and that excuse was weapons of mass destruction.</p>
<p>The War on Terror had to be fought on the streets of Baghdad today, otherwise we would be fighting it on the streets of London and Washington tomorrow.</p>
<p>But as it turned out, Saddam was one telling the truth and our leaders, Bush and Blair, were the ones telling lies.</p>
<p>SURE, Iraq did once have weapons of mass destruction. But as defector after defector, including Saddam's son-in-law, told the CIA, most had been destroyed in 1995 by the Iraqis themselves under pressure from that other despised international body, UN weapons inspectors.</p>
<p>Of course this was not the sort of intelligence that Cheney and his henchmen wanted to hear.</p>
<p>So they twisted and squeezed the evidence and even accused the CIA of being wishy-washy on terrorism until the got what they wanted - war.</p>
<p>Against all the opposition, against all the advice of their own diplomats and intelligence services, Bush and Blair won the political fight and the War on Terror in Iraq happened. Saddam Hussein was quickly overthrown.</p>
<p>His regime was a rotting edifice that could barely get the lights to work, never mind make WMD.</p>
<p>Even the oil industry was held together by sticking plaster and cobbled-together parts.</p>
<p>Saddam was a brute but he was a useless brute. The only power of terror he possessed was the power to terrorize his own people.</p>
<p>I'm glad he is gone. But I can't say his removal has made the world a better place. The cost in blood has been far too high.</p>
<p>I bet Bush sleeps soundly at night. But if there was any justice in this world he wouldn't.</p>
<p>IF there was justice the legions of the Iraqi dead, the faces of the men, women and children, blown up, killed, shot by the Allied armies would come to haunt him in the night.</p>
<p>They would stroll through his bedroom, across the thick blue carpet, one after another, armless, headless, legless.</p>
<p>And in between would be the faces of all the dead American soldiers who have joined them in the grave for his War on Terror.</p>
<p>Perhaps if there was justice one of those among the endless columns of the dead would step out of the line and get to ask Bush and Blair why all those Iraqis had to die. Where was the Terror that cancels out the death of 20,000 civilians in Bush's war in Iraq?</p>
<p>Maybe if he saw that monstrous regiment of the dead up close for himself George Bush would finally see the cost in blood and death that his foolishness has unleashed upon our world.</p>
<p>Maybe he would see that the line of terror victims is growing every day, not just in Fallujah but in Madrid, coming ever closer. And the threat growing ever greater.</p>
<p>George Bush has not saved the world from terror, he has unleashed the horsemen of the apocalypse.</p>
<p>And if he had any conscience at all, this weak and dangerous president would resign today on this grim anniversary, with his little helpmate Anthony Blair.</p>
