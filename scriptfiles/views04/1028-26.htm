I called to confirm the appointment for my son's first flu shot. He will turn 
6 months old next week. As a local public health physician and clinical faculty 
at the University of Washington School of Public Health and Community Medicine, 
I am very aware of the importance of these vaccinations.</p><p>What I was told 
was that there might well not be a shot there for him. As a physician who provides 
direct patient care, I too should be vaccinated, and when I called my own physician 
about an appointment, they too told me that vaccine might not be available for 
me either. This will not only put me at increased risk of getting the infection 
but, more important, it will put all those I care for at increased risk of getting 
the infection from me in its early stages.</p><p>The frustration, fear and anger 
have grown in this crisis to the point that some accountability for this situation 
is necessary.</p><p>Vaccines for several "routine" immunizations have been in 
short supply over the past several years. In June 2003, the U.S. Food and Drug 
Administration inspected the Chiron plant. Initially, the FDA found that the plant 
was contaminated with bacteria but later announced, "The problems were corrected 
to their satisfaction" and allowed the plant to continue to operate.</p><p>Although 
Bush administration officials were specifically warned again on Sept. 13, 2003, 
about the problems at the California-based Chiron's plant in England, they took 
no action to fully evaluate these problems or to secure an alternative supply 
(which the British government did arrange for from other manufacturers). This 
is after ignoring two GAO reports prior to that warning of impending shortfall.</p><p>President 
Bush's record of defending the interests of his cronies and ignoring the needs 
of the rest of us has become a pattern that we need to act on now by sending a 
clear message about accountability. Putting the needs and interests of the Enrons 
and Halliburtons of the world ahead of those who are most vulnerable, like my 
son and the other 280,000 children in Washington who are at risk for severe complications 
from influenza, is not acceptable.</p><p>It is time for new leadership that will 
protect working families in the United States. Please take action to replace this 
incompetence with leadership that will work hard to provide safe, effective medications 
for all of us, but particularly those who are most vulnerable. I voted as a Republican 
in the primary. I certainly am not going to on Tuesday. It is time for change.
