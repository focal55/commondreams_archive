<p>"I think they intend to go to Chicago or some place and fly into a building - Don't worry, Dad - If it happens, it'll be very fast - My God, my God." Peter Hanson, a passenger on United Airlines Flight 175, is talking to his father, Lee Hanson, at 9am on Tuesday September 11 2001. He thinks that he's about to die. A son's instinctive compassion leads him to look beyond the grave and help a father's grieving: "Don't worry, Dad - If it happens, it'll be very fast." Three minutes later, his plane strikes the World Trade Center in New York and Peter Hanson is dead. 
This phone transcript from the recently published 9/11 commission report reminds us why the United States is a country that still considers itself to be at war. As I write, Washington has just joined New York on the second highest level of alert against terrorist attack. President Bush has announced the creation of a new national intelligence director and counterterrorism Center, swiftly implementing key recommendations of the bipartisan 9/11 commission. According to a recent poll, the military is by far the most trusted institution in the United States. Four out of five Americans say they have confidence in the military, compared to just one in five who trust Congress. In the presidential election, warlike images prevail. It's as if Bush and Kerry are standing mainly for the office of commander in chief. 

<p>John Kerry started his acceptance speech at last week's Democratic convention by giving a military salute and saying, "I'm John Kerry, and I'm reporting for duty." He was introduced, very movingly, by a veteran who lost both legs and one arm fighting in Vietnam. On stage were other Vietnam veterans who served with Kerry on one of the so-called swift boats going up the Mekong river. That swift boat provided the metaphor for Kerry's whole speech. Evoking "our band of brothers" he said: "We may be a little older, we may be a little grayer, but we still know how to fight for our country." Pointing to a giant stars and stripes flag, he recalled how "Old Glory" used to fly "from the gun turret right behind my head and it was shot through and through and tattered, but it never ceased to wave in the wind." And he came back to the gunboat at the end, claiming that the men who served on it cared nothing for their differences of race and background. "That is the kind of America that I will lead as president: an America where we are all in the same boat."

<p>This unabashed, emotional, militant patriotism is something unimaginable in contemporary Europe. Watching many hours of it, glued to the television screen here in California, I felt conflicting emotions: some envy of a nation that still has the confidence and optimism to evoke those simple, primary colors, "freedom and faith and family" as Bill Clinton put it, in a brilliant speech; some alarm at the way in which my own emotions could be manipulated, for this Democratic convention was directed like a Hollywood movie. (Steven Spielberg helped with the documentary film introducing Kerry.) Then a fit of old European irony at the patriotic kitsch. John Kerry served bravely in Vietnam, but only for four and a half months. We shall be hearing about his service for a lot longer. 

<p>I was reminded of an old Czech joke about the much mythologized Slovak national rising against the Nazis: "Which lasted longer, the Slovak rising or the film about the Slovak rising?" And yet, through it all, I had an overwhelming sense that here, amid these enthusiastic men and women of every color and background, was the other, better America, which has got lost from European view amid the Cheneys, Rumsfelds and Bushes. 

<p>Of course we all understand what is behind this war show. Here are the Democrats defiantly occupying the high ground of patriotism and national security on which the Bush White House has chosen to fight this election. Swing voters should trust the seasoned Vietnam veteran Kerry to win the war on terrorism rather than the Vietnam draft-avoider Bush. Kerry's critique of the way the Iraq war has been prosecuted, alienating America's friends around the world and without any proper plan for winning the peace, is compelling. In fact, almost every point that critical Europeans have made against the Bush administration was made by Democrats at the convention. They spoke passionately about the environment. They pilloried America's dependence on "foreign oil". They talked again and again about how America cannot win this war on its own. 

<p>Will this campaign strategy work? Although people say Kerry is a strong finisher, I have a nagging feeling that he may still prove too remote and wooden for the undecided swing voters, when contrasted with the folksy Bush. (A reporter who has followed Kerry as a senator in Boston pays him a deadly compliment. John Kerry, he says, is perfectly qualified to be the president - of France.) So much will depend on what happens in the last weeks of the campaign; in America, and in Iraq. If it were possible for this to happen without more American soldiers coming home in bodybags, and tens of ordinary Iraqis dying for every one American, I would express the Machiavellian hope that things should get visibly worse in Iraq until election day, then dramatically better from November 3 on. 

<p>If Kerry does scrape home, Europe will find a president who leads a more congenial America in almost every respect. But we won't be back to business as usual before September 11 2001. The key difference is now clear. All American leaders think we are at war; most European leaders think we are still at peace. 

<p>The Bush administration started out believing that the United States could, if need be, win this war on its own. A Kerry administration would start from the position that this war can only be won by working with America's friends and allies around the world. It will therefore ask us to step straight up to the plate. Kerry's carefully unspecific recipe for the future of Iraq is that bringing more allies on board should help to reduce the American troop presence there. 

<p>If Europe has any wisdom at all, we should start thinking now about how we answer this Democratic challenge. Our answer should be, "Yes, so long as _ " Yes, so long as you rededicate yourself to a peace process between Israel and Palestine. So long as you recognize that Iraq has to be embedded into a much larger project of reform and development in the broader Middle East, which America and Europe can only achieve together. So long as you deliver on your promises to develop alternative energy technologies, address your own excessive carbon dioxide emissions, come back to the international treaties and institutions that the Bush administration abrogated and scorned. 

<p>We're all in the same boat, too, and we want to be. However, before skipper Kerry pulls the throttle, we have to agree not just the rules of engagement but who exactly the enemy is and what creek we're up.
