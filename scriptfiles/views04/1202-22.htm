<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p>Car magnets in the shape of yellow ribbons inscribed with "Support Our Troops" have become a ubiquitous phenomenon in recent months.  In fact, it's gotten to the point where cars that don't have them seem to stand out on the road, and this is coming from a driver in an urban area, in a blue state.  

 

<p>There is a strong connection between the War in Iraq today and the Vietnam War.  They are both wars that are/were unpopular with the American people.  Recent polls indicate that roughly 50% of Americans disagree with the invasion of Iraq, and see it as weakening the "War on Terrorism" and as a mistake in general (<a href="http://www.pollingreport.com/iraq.htm" target="_new">http://www.pollingreport.com/iraq.htm</a>).  There are other apparent similarities between the Vietnam War and today's war.  Our troops today, like the Americans fighting in Vietnam, are fighting an elusive enemy that uses guerilla tactics and draws its ranks from civilians by force or through a volunteerism that has surely not been discouraged by the living conditions and violence under American occupation (an occupation that we refuse to call occupation).  

 

<p>When attempting to frame or inform a discussion of the present War in Iraq using an allusion to the Vietnam War, one encounters a fundamental disconnect if considering the evident, unilateral American support of the troops fighting today's war. (Interestingly, this makes the lack of support the Vietnam War troops received ironic, considering the fact that many of them were unwillingly drafted and that the Iraqi War's army is comprised of volunteers, whether coerced or not).  So unlike the days of Vietnam, being a liberal no longer excludes you from the pool of people who display their support of our troops on their bumpers.  Nicole Makris's "Don't Hate the Soldja, Hate the Game" (<a href="http://www.alternet.org/wiretap/20252" target="_new">http://www.alternet.org/wiretap/20252</a>) makes this valid political position clear. 

 

<p>While we can all agree, in hindsight, that the total lack of respect that troops arriving back from Vietnam in the 1960s and 1970s received can only be described as misdirected spite, there seems to have been an unspoken pact made between liberals since that time.  The last national election made this pact clear, and it cost the liberal contingent in this country the Presidential seat.  The agreement liberals seem to have made with each other is that we should believe and pander to the conservative definition of patriotism.  Yes, supporting the troops is a part of what it means to be patriotic.  But emphatically saying no to the war that put them in harm's way to begin with, a war that we were led into without cause or necessity and under the guise of lies about invisible weapons of mass destruction, is more patriotic than anything you can wrap a flag around, including a coffin.  

 

<p>Despite the fact that the United States is filled with intelligent and thoughtful people, the distinction between supporting the war and supporting the troops was never effectively made by either the DNC or John Kerry himself.  They played on the conservative, Republican battlefield of dualism where those against the war were against the troops period.  And what did the Democrats fire back with: John Kerry's valor in Vietnam.  It's not that Kerry's service record in Vietnam is irrelevant to the topic of the War in Iraq or his ability to act as Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Military.  It's just that it seems that we swallowed the lie that Americans are too simple or too emotional to make this not-so-subtle distinction between troop support and support for the war.  

 

<p>There was also a failure on the Democrats' side to emphasize that the Bush Administration does NOT support the troops in the most important ways.  Our troops are deprived of having the right quantity and quality of equipment necessary to fight this war.  My stepbrother Richard Flores drove an ill-fitted and unsafe Humvee back and forth the Iraqi desert as a transportation and supplies facilitator for over a year of the War in Iraq.  He saw several American soldiers killed and is lucky to be alive himself as a result of the Pentagon's failure to get him and his companions the right equipment.  In fact, it has been repeatedly reported that some of the Hummers being driven by American troops aren't even as safe as their street-legal counterparts that clog up American city streets.  (But, I guess it's appropriate since all we seem to be fighting this war for is the right to continue driving these monstrosities to the grocery store.)  In July, Graydon Carter asserted the astonishing fact that "...ground troops in Iraq have reported shortages of more quotidian elements of war, everything from ammunition, protective gear, and armored vehicles to walkie-talkies..." (Vanity Fair "Editor's Letter").  Additionally, the Bush Administration is and has been in the process of cutting veterans' benefits and soldiers' salaries and ability to leave when they've finished their tours or obligation to the military. 

 

<p>The Republicans put the Democrats on the defensive by accusing them of being unpatriotic, and instead of pointing out the obvious fact that the people fighting the war aren't the people who made the decision to go to war, liberals played the patriot game.  The Democratic party brought out their war heroes and assumed that the American people would be too dense to understand a patriotism rooted in something deeper than pompous war-mongering.  And now we'll have to suffer through another four years of faux, self-serving patriotism before America is given another chance.  The next time, I hope the young people of America won't let the opposition tell us what we believe in or that the two separate issues of supporting our troops and supporting a war we don't agree with are inextricably linked. 

 

<p>So, go ahead, liberals smack those "Support Our Troops" magnets on the back of you car, but make sure there's a prominent anti-War in Iraq or anti-Bush Administration bumper sticker next to it.  Let the world know that there's no black and white when it comes to war, and there should be no contradiction in what supporting our troops really means: Giving them the necessary tools and financial support they need to fight effectively, and bringing them home standing on their own legs, sooner rather than later.
