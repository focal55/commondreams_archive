<p>Law-breaker, union-buster, tax-escapee and shifter of costs to others, 
the world’s largest retailer, Wal-Mart, announced last week that it 
would respect the wishes of its Chinese workers to form a union. As is 
usual with Wal-Mart announcements, a substantial overstatement is 
working here.

<P>In China, unions are not independent; they are government-controlled 
with the Chinese communist party turning them into what would be called 
“company unions” in the U.S. With 40 stores in China already, Wal-Mart 
understands that these essentially Communist Party-controlled unions 
serve as a controlling mechanism over workers – a one-stop system which 
often have an in-company manager in charge.

<P>China is seen by Wal-Mart as the future. With the U.S. market 
approaching saturation (Wal-Mart has 3,600 big and bigger stores here), 
the company with the biggest gross revenues in the world -- $258.7 
billion last year – is importing more from Chinese factories then is the 
entire country of Germany.

<P>Its message to U.S. suppliers is that if they cannot meet the “China 
price,” they should close down in America and open up in the world’s 
largest communist dictatorship. Astonishing, isn’t it, that this giant 
capitalist corporation is using this Communist regime as its labor 
enforcement arm to drive down wages and benefits in the U.S.

<P>In Western Europe, Wal-Mart has to treat its workers better than it 
treats its American workers. European labor laws are much tougher than 
those in the U.S. Wal-Mart has to give its workers paid vacations (from 
four to eight weeks depending on the country), better benefits and 
working conditions. There is no “off the clock” work or wages not fully 
paid for long periods of time. Wal-Mart has even agreed to collectively 
bargain with a large German union.

<P>In the country of its birth, Wal-Mart is wreaking havoc with worker 
standards of living. It forces other large grocery chains to demand from 
their unionized employees lower wages and benefits to be able to compete 
with Wal-Mart’s race to the bottom. This direction is a historically 
tragic reversal for the U.S. economy that before World War II featured 
rising wages that increased consumer demand and improved livelihoods.

<P>Increasingly, Wal-Mart’s immense arc of influence here is pushing wages 
and benefits downward. With hundreds of thousands of its nearly 1.4 
million workers making under $7.50 an hour, before payroll deductions, 
(the average wage is between $7.50 and $8.50 an hour), the 
average-on-the-clock workweek is only 32 hours. Since Wal-Mart defines 
anyone working fewer than 34 hours per week as part-time, they have to 
wait for two years before qualifying for health insurance whose 
co-payment takes one-fifth of the average paycheck. Get the idea of what 
is meant by the Wal-Mart way.

<P>Waiting periods are key to Wal-Mart’s phony health insurance boasting in 
their television ads. Impoverished employees don’t stay, with turnover 
rates for these hourly employees at 50 percent to 100 percent at many 
stores.

<P>Wal-Mart is devilishly ingenious in thinking up ways to have taxpayers 
fill in its wage gap. Put them on partial welfare, says the very well-paid company bosses who make millions of dollars each per year. These 
workers are given advice on how to apply so that taxpayers subsidize 
Wal-Mart’s profits.

<P>For example, in Georgia, over 10,261 children of Wal-Mart employees are 
enrolled in the state’s Peachcare program for health insurance in 
families meeting federal poverty criteria.

<P>According to the report, <em>Everyday Low Wages</em>, one 200-person Wal-Mart 
store could cost federal taxpayers over $420,000 per year. These costs 
include subsidized lunches, health insurance and housing assistance, 
federal tax credits and deductions for low-income families, among other 
examples of Wal-Mart’s freeloading.

<P>Enough is never enough for this corporation. It often demands 
substantial local tax breaks from municipalities as a condition for 
locating there. Although successful local opposition is blocking dozens 
of Wal-Mart location plans, this corporate welfare King still manages to 
escape its fair share of taxes, while local homeowner and small 
businesses ante up for local public services and assume Wal-Mart’s 
share. That is, small businesses that manage to remain in the hollowed 
out Main Streets that are the aftermath of a Wal-Mart opening. Minimal thinking by consumers says Wal-Mart is a bargain; maximum 
thinking starts adding up the local, national and global costs of this 
Goliath depressor of purchasing power by workers.
