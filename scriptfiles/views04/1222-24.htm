<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p>The Most Important Election of Our Lifetimes came and went last 
month, but an equally important one is upon us. No, this is not the January 
runoff in Baghdad, but the annual slugfest with advertising budgets that dwarf 
John Kerry and George W. Bush's campaign coffers.
<P>That's right, I'm talking about Christmas. Every winter, retailers 
campaign for your dollars in the same way that candidates rally for your vote. 
They purchase air time and make extravagant promises (buy my product and you 
will be happy); appeal to your patriotism (a real American uses these kinds of 
goods); and even go negative on another  --  our competitor lies to you about 
its record. And when it's all over, we feel that same slightly queasy sense of 
relief. Thank God we're almost there, right?
<P>Well, actually, no. The consumer election happens every day, not just 
every Christmas. Consider the first 15 minutes of your morning. You wake up 
and brew a pot of coffee, run a shower, get dressed and pour yourself some 
cereal. If there's time, maybe you read the paper and check your stocks or buy 
a book over Amazon.com before leaving for work. In this ritual, dozens of 
decisions are just as important as votes. Who harvested that coffee? And were 
they paid fairly? How long did your shower take and where does your town water 
come from? What are those ingredients in your cereal? What companies are in 
your portfolio? Do you know what their business practices are? Where do their 
political-campaign contributions go? Finally, do you drive to work alone? Why 
don't you carpool?
<P>Spend five minutes thinking about this tiny slice of your day and you 
might be surprised what you discover. Let's say you have reservations about 
the war in Iraq or even oppose it outright. Do your mutual funds hold stocks 
in defense contractors? If so, is it consistent for you to benefit from your 
mutual fund's shares of Halliburton or McDonnell Douglas? How is that 
different from war profiteering?
<P>Or let's say that you want the United States to become less dependent on 
Middle East oil. But you drive a Dodge Durango or a Chevy Blazer. Has it 
occurred to you that your choice of vehicle has necessitated the dependence 
you object to?
<P>Deciding whether you'll support one company over another based on its 
campaign contributions has become easier with the advent of the Internet. One 
site  --  <A HREF="http://www.opensecrets.org">www.opensecrets.org</A>, run by the nonpartisan Center for Responsive 
Politics  --  offers profiles of industry and sector that list total 
contributions to federal candidates and party committees from employees and 
political action committees of the companies listed. 
<P>This is not to say that whenever you make a purchase you need to consider 
whether you are giving money to a Republican  --  or, from the other side  --  
a Democrat. It has to do with asserting your will on a global system designed, 
in part, to obscure the messier details about how sustainable profits and low 
prices are achieved.
<P>Think about it. When you buy a Fisher-Price toy on sale at Toys 'R' Us, 
it's hard to argue with quality and pleasure of that toy. Until, of course, 
you consider a Los Angeles Times article last month about how Mattel, the 
company that owns Fisher-Price, uses Chinese manufacturers that keep workers 
in sweatshop conditions  --  working as much as 24 hours a day for 20 cents an 
hour. This, despite Mattel's own efforts to police the conditions of its 
subcontractors.
<P>As citizens of the world's most powerful (and destructive) country, we 
need to learn how to make questions about the costs of convenience second 
nature. If not for the benefit of other people, then at least our own. Because 
if we continue to claim that globalization benefits societies  --  whom we 
keep poor by giving them manufacturing jobs that pay far lower wages than our 
citizens would ever accept  --  we can expect more blowback in the way of 
terrorist attacks, trade wars and general dislike of America.
<P>Beliefs not backed up by action become opinions, and you can get all the 
opinions you want from talking heads on TV. You don't have to become so 
paralyzed with research that you can't buy anything, but you can look into 
what you're passionate about and vote with your dollars. Political activism 
didn't end Nov. 2. In fact, that should be the beginning.
<P>Think of it this way: Car manufacturers did not make cars safer until 
consumers began demanding safer automobiles. Corporations will do the same if 
consumers begin wielding that powerful weapon all over again: their wallets.
