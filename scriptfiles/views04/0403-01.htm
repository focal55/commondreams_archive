<p> 
President Bush was correct in asserting that 9/11 changed us. One way this change was reflected was in the sense of community the attacks fostered as we shared our shock and grief. Civil servants and people from all backgrounds reached out, many risking or giving their lives for others. Fellow nations of the world extended their sympathy and support. It was the best of humanity that stood out in sharp contrast to the barbaric and criminal murder of thousands. 
<p> 

Another change can be seen in the critical debate these events, and our political leaders' response to them, have opened up in communities across the country about what policies will more likely create a just and peaceful world in which terrorism is least likely to occur. 
<p> 

Despite misinformation to the contrary, collective security based on international law and the protection of human rights is not a new or radical idea. Rather, it was recognized as imperative after the death and destruction of two world wars, the second of which saw large-scale genocide and the unleashing of nuclear weapons. 
<p> 

The wide diversity of people who drafted the U.N. charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights conceded that the instruments they created were flawed; however, an unprecedented foundation had been laid upon which the future could build. Subsequently, various peace and human rights activists have worked tirelessly, often with little fanfare and far fewer resources than the vested interests they are forced to confront, to strengthen that body of law and the institutions necessary to enforce it. But it has not been enough. 
<p> 

Indeed, the need for stronger institutions and reforms has never been more pressing. According to Amnesty International, at the beginning of the 20th century, civilians comprised 10% of warfare casualties. By the end of the century, they comprised 90% of casualties through death, maiming and forced displacement. This, coupled with technological advances in destructive capacity, underscores the urgency of the problems of war and human rights protections.
<p> 

Of the more than one hundred local and regional wars since 1945, the U.N. intervened forcibly in only a handful, including Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. Shortly after repelling that aggression, however, a vicious war in the Balkans commenced in which nearly a quarter million people perished while the U.N. basically sat on the sidelines. When genocide was occurring in Rwanda in 1994, the U.N. and its member nations circumvented their duty to act resolutely by avoiding the term "genocide" and characterizing the slaughter as "tribal" killings. General Romeo Dallaire of Canada has recounted how he could have stopped the slaughter had he simply been provided 5,000 more well-equipped troops. The U.N. turned him down. He also asked the U.S. government to block the radio transmissions that were stoking the violence. He was refused. A Defense Department memo rationalized the denial by stating that the cost of jamming the broadcasts would be $8,500.00 per hour. Understandably, the U.N., in its capacity as a vehicle for collective security, has been seen as ineffective at best. The problems underlying its ineffectiveness, though, remain largely a matter of political will.
<p> 

The end of the Cold War provided an opportunity to commit our resources to bolstering genuine security and international law. Yet, there are many indications that, in our unique leadership position in the world, we have been going in the wrong direction in attaining this goal. 
<p> 

One disturbing trend is our continuous role as the top exporter of arms to human rights abusers. The U.S. government covertly armed Osama bin Laden and other mujadeen fighters to facilitate the draining of the Soviet Union's resources and morale through a protracted war in Afghanistan. After Soviet withdrawal, Afghanistan was literally reduced to rubble with a devastated population at the mercy of Islamic fundamentalists. Then we armed Saddam Hussein even after receiving confirmed intelligence that he had committed atrocities against thousands of Iranian soldiers. The justification was that he was an ally against Islamic fundamentalism. 

<p> 
In fact, the Iraq war marks the seventh consecutive time that U.S. troops have been deployed against opponents who have worn out their previous Faustian usefulness and are now armed with U.S. weapons. The logical fallacy of "my enemy's enemy is my friend" has failed consistently and tragically.
<p> 

Similarly, several middle east scholars have noted that the more militarized that region has become, the more terrorism they have witnessed. Furthermore, terrorism experts have documented that the swing factor in the making of a terrorist, beyond contributing factors like poverty, is often membership in or identification with a group suffering a deep sense of humiliation. Many terrorists have experience with torture at the hands of their own governments, which brings us back to the moral and practical implications of militarism and providing arms and aid to some of the most brutally repressive regimes, such as Paki<p> stan and Saudi Arabia, the latter of which produced the majority of the 9/11 hijackers. Additionally, we now have over 700 military bases in 38 countries. The people who live in those countries express open resentment at the presence of these bases which they typically view as a symbol of U.S. dominance and disrespect. 
<p> 

Moreover, our resistance to multilateral agreements on a range of pressing issues, from arms control to the International Criminal Court, creates the distinct impression to the rest of the world that we reserve the right to choose where others must obey. This is borne out by two recent polls conducted by the Pew Research Center in which significant numbers of people outside our borders believe that our government has no concern for their interests and that our policies have contributed to the terrorism we are now fighting. 
<p> 
The overwhelming lesson here is that militarism, the sacrifice of human rights and a vigilante mentality are not effective antidotes to terrorism, they are part of the problem. It is ironic that the very politicians who advocate a strong sense of the rule of law domestically continue to deny its serious application to the international arena.
