<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Many Republicans' biggest beef with Democrats is closely tied to the lack of morality in our nation. They hate the vulgarization of society, the disappearance of inhibitions spawned by the exposure and exchange of tongues and flesh on magazine covers and on television, and the anything-goes attitude that threatens childhood and betrays what we know is really important in life.</font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> They make some good points about our cultural atmosphere. It is, after all, a big reason &quot;why they hate us&quot; - the loosing of American values (&quot;values&quot; being a neutral term here) on the rest of the world. Much of American mass culture dumbs down life and promotes poor health and bad self-esteem. It is depreciation of humanity that is ultimately the product we pitch incessantly and universally through Baywatch, Hollywood and McDonald's. One need only to turn on the television to see the celebration of erection, the commoditization of sexuality, the quest for lust, the endless pushing of the bright flashing lies that are about physical beauty in order to marginalize intellect, self-worth and spirituality. </font></P><P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> It is important not to oversimplify, of course. Some things America offers to the world - food, aid, democracy - are invaluable. But others are offensive or just plain stupid, such as &quot;Terminator 2,&quot; or &quot;The Jeffersons,&quot; or the bikini-babe-beer-car-deodorant commercials, or the particularly bad videos on MTV, or the Super Bowl halftime show, seen in more than 200 nations. </font></P><P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> We see these things so much it rarely occurs to us that they can be offensive to others - it's funny that it takes something as mundane as a nipple star to shake us to our cores. But we should realize that it is precisely these &quot;Terminator 2&quot; hypings of sex and violence and MTV's misogyny and crass vulgarity that form the American image abroad.  Yes, MTV is popular - many the people of the world, especially the young, are now consuming it and our other cultural products. But that is the point- our mass culture is, almost without their awareness, making them into consumers of our crass culture.</font></P><P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">	       So, these alarmed Republicans have a right to be upset. Yet they have a slight problem in the blame game.</font></P><P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">	        Who do you think is responsible for the spread of the American culture that could easily be considered a lightning rod that has polarized the much of the world into a cultural battle of East vs. West, Muslim vs. Chrisitian? Who is responsible for the routine repetitive cycle of sex and murders shown every day on airwaves all the world round; who is responsible for the satellite sexual gyrations that are now met by yawns in America and among the youth around the world? And who do you think stamps out any ideas that interfere with the selling of the product?</font></P><P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">	       Clue: It isn't the Democrats.</font></P><P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">	        It's the media, stupid.</font></P><P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">	        Michael Powell, chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, noted that the commission had received more than 200,000 letters and emails protesting the exposure of Janet Jackson's breast during the Super Bowl halftime show.</font></P><P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">	        Armed with this outcry, Powell jumped on the chance to decry the display of the breast and to denounce the decay of programming on television. He and others went on and on about the decline of values and morality. </font></P><P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">	        That may have seemed wonderful. Finally - a Republican regulator finally standing up to an industry that he regulates. </font></P><P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">	        Yet it was all bluster. That's because Powell and his Republican commissioners have already voted for policies that will increase the mundane, sexually idiotic content spewed out by the media.</font></P><P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">	         Flash back a few months ago. Before the FCC voted to increase media monopolies in America, it received a far greater outcry among citizens than from those worried about Janet Jackson's breast. The Republican commisioners ignored the hundreds of thousands of emails and letters, refused to hold substantive hearings on the issue, and approved more dominance for media conglomerates. The Republican Congress, in a surprise obedience to the will of the people, overturned the outrageous decision of the Republican-dominated FCC, and rolled back the changes. Then the extremist House Republicans, with the backing of President Bush, ignored the wishes of millions. Although more than 90 percent - 90 percent! - of Americans said they were against the changes, the House Republicans stealthily approved a slightly smaller version of media consolidation. It amounted charity for billionaire media moguls, courtesy of Bush and his backers.</font></P><P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">	       In college media studies classes, one of the things that is taught is the consequences of big media. One of the most important is the debasement of culture. In other words, big media conglomerates are concerned only with gathering audiences and selling products. The best way to do this is to make programming as visceral as possible to the largest numbers of people. In some cases, this results in involving shows. But in many, many, other cases, it results in the lowest-common demoninator of programming - it results in exactly what Michael Powell said about the Super Bowl halftime show - a new low. It results in Jerry Springer, stupid strippers and sex and violence as commodities. It's not so much that the programming is too sexy - it is that it is so utterly banal and vile that it cheapens sex and desensitizes us to things that really are beautiful or sexy.</font></P><P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">	        To Americans, it is very naive to think that many television shows should be about ideas. After all, the marketplace rules, and it doesn't have much time for ideas.</font></P><P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">	        But to Powell and Bush, ideas are not even a consideration in their vision of the communications - instead it is all about market and turning more of that market over to their billionaire friends.</font></P><P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">	        Yet it is the market, frankly, that has given us the degregadation of the world's discourse - the world's morality enthrall to the will of giant media moguls who care about one tiny, gigantic thing: how much money they can make by shocking and appalling and titillating us - and how much that moronic display can make us watch and buy.</font></P><P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">	       Bush and Powell gave more of that market to the purveyors of the coarse and the crass. Funny that the biggest preachers of media morality are largely responsible for sinking it to a new low.</font></P><P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><I>Guy Reel is an assistant professor of mass communication at Winthrop University.</I></font></P>
