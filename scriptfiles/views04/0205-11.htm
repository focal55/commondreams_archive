<p>It's a good thing presidents are legally required to submit annual budgets. Otherwise, President Bush never would have dared present a budget carrying a $521 billion deficit in an election year.

<p>Bush is betting that Congress and voters will accept his budget – and the priorities it reflects – because they have no choice. Wars are expensive, he argues, and tax cuts are his pledge. Put those things together and you get, inexorably, record deficits.

<p>If Americans buy that argument, Bush is home free, and the Democrats are cooked. Bush is telling Americans they don't have to make tough choices and that huge deficits don't matter because they will wash away in a great tax-cut-generated economic boom – preferably before November.

<p>It's an argument against history and common sense.

<p>It's against history because nations don't cut taxes in wartime. War is a national trial to be borne by all – not just soldiers in the field. People at home must feel its burdens as well. 

<p>In World War II, the homefront paid more, worked harder for less money, and endured rationing.

<p>Lyndon Johnson declined to raise taxes to pay for Vietnam because he pretended it wasn't a real war. But Johnson didn't cut taxes, and the nation still came out of Vietnam in its worst shape since World War II.

<p>Ronald Reagan cut taxes while paying for a huge defense buildup and a year later had to raise them because of ballooning debt.

<p>Bush's budget also is an argument against common sense. People know that hard work is what erases debt, not the fairy godmother. Polls show Americans prefer a tax increase to saddling future taxpayers with debt. Common sense says that big issues such as war, health care, Social Security, Medicare, education cannot be met by tax cuts.

<p>The premise behind Bush's deficits – that Americans will accept them because they're driven by national security – is false. Bush's "national security has no price" argument deserves serious scrutiny.

<p>In this budget national security indeed has "no price" because Bush has kept war costs in Iraq and Afghanistan "off budget," and we are given no accounting clue what they will cost. Military spending increases 7 percent even without war costs. Bush says there are precedents for this strange accounting, but there is no precedent for keeping war off-budget when tax cuts are on-budget.

<p>Bush's budget director says perhaps another $50 billion will be needed for wars, increasing the real projected one-year deficit to $571 billion. He'll ask for the money later.

<p>Another argument against "security has no price" is priorities. What if your priorities actually decrease security? Bush told the nation invading Iraq would increase national security. Signs indicate, however, that by inflaming world opinion and energizing terrorist cells, Bush's war has decreased our security.

<p>National security has one certain price: You pay more if you make bad choices.

<p>Bush's budget bet is that none of this resonates with Americans. He's betting we are too dumb or too selfish to know that wars and tax cuts are incompatible. He's betting that whatever we may think of his war, we're willing to accept what's done as done and not hold him to account.

<p>He didn't have to abuse us with this budget. Here are some things he could have done:

<p>He could have sacrificed his tax cut plan to pay for the war and told Americans that was their obligation.

<p>He could have put an estimate of war costs on budget.

<p>He could have foregone a Medicare drug bill that helps insurance and drug companies as much as seniors and will add $534 billion (up from $395 billion) to the deficit over 10 years. Medicare drug coverage is necessary, but not this bill at a time of high deficits.

<p>He could have refrained from bloating the military budget with a host of marginal but expensive items, such as a deployed missile defense system. Terrorists don't need or want strategic missiles. How about a smaller investment in security for our seaports?

<p>This budget reflects Bush priorities, foremost among them paying for pre-emptive war in Iraq. Beyond that, there are other odd choices:

<p>Is this the time to start spending for a manned mission to Mars? What about Earth? Environmental protection suffers a 7 percent budget loss in this budget, money directed into subsidies for energy and drug companies and big farms. How does a program for abstinence-only sex education cost $270 million? Why doesn't he recognize the alternative minimum tax problem, which carries a $500 billion, 10-year cost?

<p>Hand it to him: Bush lays out these questionable priorities in an election year, betting we'll accept them because we have no choice, because he's a "wartime" president, and nations don't turn out presidents in wartime. 

<p>Some Americans will buy that. Others will recognize that Bush made war by choice, not necessity. Many will recognize that if you are a wartime president you must be a wartime leader, which means explaining to the nation the true cost of war, and making sure those costs are shared by all.
