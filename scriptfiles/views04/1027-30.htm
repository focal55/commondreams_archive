<tr align="left" valign="top"> <td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p>&nbsp;“We 
think lawsuit abuse is a serious problem in this country,&quot; proclaimed Dick 
Cheney while debating John Edwards earlier this month. That &quot;runaway lawsuits&quot; 
theme is repeated at almost every Bush/Cheney campaign stop.</p><p>Knowing the 
record of his own company, I can't help wondering whether Cheney is like an alcoholic 
seeking help, for during his five-year reign as CEO, Halliburton and its subsidiaries 
filed more than 150 separate court actions (documented by <a href="http://halliburtonwatch.org/" target="_new">Halliburton 
Watch)</a>. Those lawsuits pursued injunctions, evictions, and attempted to collect 
alleged debts from other corporations and individuals, sometimes for as little 
as $1,500.</p><p>But Halliburton is just part of a larger pattern. A <a href="http://citizen.org/pressroom/release.cfm?ID=1799" target="_new">recent 
study</a> by Public Citizen indicates that the 7 million U.S. corporations file 
four times as many lawsuits as the 281 million individual Americans, so corporations 
are 160 times as likely to sue as an average person. </p><p>The study covered 
the only four U.S. jurisdictions that require records with enough detail to distinguish 
corporate-initiated lawsuits from those filed on behalf of individuals: Mississippi, 
Arkansas, Philadelphia and Cook County (Chicago and vicinity).</p><p>And what 
about the &quot;frivolous lawsuits&quot; we hear about constantly? The same Public 
Citizen study noted, &quot;businesses and their attorneys were 69 percent more 
likely than individual tort plaintiffs and their attorneys to be sanctioned by 
federal judges for filing frivolous claims or defenses.&quot;</p><p>Scrolling 
down big business' hit list, next up is &quot;runaway awards.&quot; Here again, 
if large awards are a serious problem, corporations seem to be the primary cause. 
Last November, National Law Journal reported that eight of the year's 10 largest 
awards to date involved corporations suing each other.</p><p>And while Cheney 
blamed frivolous lawsuits for their &quot;devastating impact&quot; on health-care 
costs during the VP debate, perhaps he should focus on suits filed by pharmaceutical 
corporations, rather than injured citizens. In 2001, a federal court ruled that 
Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS) filed frivolous patent-infringement lawsuits to block 
the introduction of generic competition for its lucrative anti-anxiety drug, BuSpar. 
Despite &quot;losing&quot; the claim, BMS delayed competition for four months, 
during which it gouged Americans for about four times the price it could charge 
in a competitive market. BMS's actions were so egregious that the Federal Trade 
Commission ordered the company to halt &quot;any fraudulent or objectively baseless 
claim or otherwise engage in sham litigation.&quot;</p><p>Again, this is an example 
of systemic abuse. As Merrill Goozner documents in his exhaustively-researched 
book, &quot;The $800 Million Pill,&quot; baseless claims to extend patent monopolies 
are routine practice for BMS and other drug manufacturers.</p><p>Of course, the 
corporate lobbyists behind calls for &quot;tort reform&quot; aren't so concerned 
by these cases. Class-action lawsuits -- which help average citizens harmed by 
corporate negligence or malevolence to gain compensation and punish the offender 
-- are their target. So while Congress considers capping class-action punitive 
damages (awards in such cases have not increased over the past decade) at $250,000, 
the bill wouldn't touch frivolous suits like those filed by BMS.</p><p>I've worked 
for years organizing and advocating for independent business owners, and learned 
there are indeed a few unscrupulous lawyers filing sleazy lawsuits. Since large 
corporations generally will fight any questionable lawsuit, small businesses that 
can't afford the time or risk of fighting are the usual targets.</p><p>We should 
strive to eliminate such suits and rid the legal profession of those who file 
them, but a $250,000 cap on punitive damages would do little to discourage the 
offenders. Their aim is to coerce smaller out-of-court settlements, not go to 
trial.</p><p>That cap on damages, however, would endanger every American, because 
the amount is inadequate to deter or change criminal practices at large companies. 
Consider that BMS voluntarily paid more than $500 million to victims of its fraudulent 
patent claim, and you quickly see that a $250,000 punishment is insufficient to 
deter large corporate criminals.</p><p>When asked during the debate if he thought 
Senator Edwards, a former trial lawyer, was part of the lawsuit problem, Cheney 
responded, &quot;I'm not familiar with his cases.&quot; (As if Bush campaign staffers 
didn't scrutinize every lawsuit the man ever filed). But as The Washington Post 
noted, Edwards' previous political opponents seeking dirt &quot;came away frustrated 
because Edwards' clients were almost universally sympathetic figures.&quot; Like 
most trial lawyers, he helped genuine victims get justified compensation and deter 
wrongdoers from harming others.</p><p>The attack on trial lawyers is really an 
attack on citizens' ability to sue corporations, and it goes far beyond this election 
cycle; it's part of a long-term assault on the rights of citizens and small business 
owners to hold corporations accountable via the courts. Having successfully undermined 
or dismantled regulations on big business in many realms, the next corporate agenda 
item is to regulate <em>us </em> -- to strip citizens of our right to punish corporate 
crime and criminals.</p><p>We can and should find ways to curb groundless lawsuits, 
including disbarring lawyers deemed by judges and peers to have repeatedly filed 
unjustified lawsuits (and nobody despises unscrupulous attorneys more than honest 
ones). Genuine improvements, however, must work narrowly to discourage the small 
fraction of suits that truly are frivolous, not shield giant corporations from 
one of our few functioning tools to hold them accountable. </p><p><I>Jeff Milchen
