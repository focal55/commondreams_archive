On March 2, 2004, voters in Mendocino County, rugged individualists on 
California’s rugged north coast, approved a ballot measure making it the 
first municipality in the United States to ban the growing of genetically 
engineered plants and animals. The proponents of the ban, outspent 7 to 1 by 
a torrent of corporate biotech money funneled into the county via a front 
group for Monsanto, DuPont, Dow Chemical et al to kill the measure, won with 
57% of the vote. A few months later, just north of Mendocino, the Trinity 
County board of supervisors, not waiting for a ballot measure, followed 
suit. Three more California counties now have their own versions of 
Mendocino’s GE crop ban on their November ballots.

<p>It may turn out to be the most important ballot line in the country. To 
understand why, it helps to know the story of Dr. Ignacio Chapela.

<p>When it comes to the perils of uttering a discouraging word about genetic 
engineering and the $220 billion industry peddling it, Chapela knows whereof 
he speaks. Three years ago, the UC Berkeley biotech researcher had the 
misfortune of leading the team that first discovered and reported transgenic 
DNA pollution in the maize of southern Mexico, the cradle of the world’s 
seed stock for corn. The specter of Mexco’s multiple corn varieties 
overwhelmed by a genetically engineered strain would be an international 
disaster for biodiversity and food security, and Mexico had been assured by 
the backers of NAFTA that the free-trade flood of GE corn from the US would 
not create that problem. Dr. Chapela’s revelation therefore was keenly 
unwelcome in the halls of corporate biotech and by those trying to sell the 
GE bounty elsewhere in the world. His findings, published in the scientific 
journal Nature, were instantly and intensely attacked -- his data, 
methodology and conclusions were slipshod, prejudiced, bad science, etc. 
Under industry pressure, Nature published an unprecedented apology for 
publishing the paper. UC Berkeley, which had just signed a $25-million 
research & patents deal with Swiss biotech giant Novartis, denied Chapela 
tenure despite the unanimous recommendation of his department. An 
investigation by The Guardian of London later uncovered evidence that the 
attack on Chapela was orchestrated by a Washington p.r. firm that 
specializes in biotech industry clients.

<p>Five subsequent studies have confirmed what Chapela reported in 2001: 
Transgenic corn from the US is contaminating the native maize of Mexico. The 
papers' authors have not been able to get them published anywhere.

<p>When Dr. Chapela came to San Luis Obispo’s Unitarian Fellowship Center on 
October 10 to speak in support of Measure Q, the ban on growing GE crops in 
the county, he didn’t go into the details of his harrowing personal story, 
but his qualifications -- a resume spanning the biotech industry, government 
and the groves of academe -- were obvious as he laid out the problem: 
Genetically engineered crops were seen from the inception of the technology 
as a huge cash cow waiting to be milked. In the rush to commercialize the 
science, “we had to look the other way” in terms of the lack of data or risk 
studies. Now, 25 years down the road, “the green light and blank check” that 
was issued to biotech to get the product to market in a hurry means the data 
we should have been collecting isn’t there; only about 10 studies on human 
health and GMO’s have been performed, and half of those have discovered 
reasons for concern -- including malformed organs, tumors, and early death 
in lab rats. The measures now on the ballots of three counties in 
California, he said, are needed to buy the time necessary for the research 
to catch up to GE's runaway engine of commerce.

<p>There were two scientists on the panel from Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo’s 
training center for future farmers and engineers. Speaking after Dr. 
Chapela, and clearly not yet having found themselves in a position to learn 
what Chapela has learned about the world and the way it really works, they 
ignored everything he had said and trotted out their arguments opposed to a 
crop ban.

<p>First, they tried a magic trick. Dr. Scott Steinmaus instructed audience 
members who had each been given two ears of corn upon entering to partially 
peel back the leaves on the ears marked with a minus sign. All discovered 
the browned, disheveled tips that are the hallmark of the corn ear worm. 
Then -- reminding the audience that he had just picked these ears from Cal 
Poly’s fields that morning, and, of course, couldn't say what they’d find -- 
Steinmaus asked the audience to semi-shuck the “+” -marked ears, from the 
college’s GE field, which were all found to be be pearly yellow perfection 
and corn ear worm free. He beamed. (As a kid, when I was assigned the task 
of shucking and boiling the corn for Sunday dinner, I would flick off the 
worm, if present, cut off the brown tip with a two-dollar paring knife and 
drop the corn in the pot. Little did I know that I could one day circumvent 
this low-tech solution to this vegetable emergency thanks to a $220 billion 
industry that would also draft me into an experiment that may bequeath to my 
descendants liver failure or congenital deformities.)

<p>Then Dr. Dan Peterson made the “don’t stop the march of progress” argument, 
making the analogy to the early days of the automotive industry: Dangerously 
unsafe early vehicles gradually improved, their defects eliminated through 
research. We didn’t ban cars; the technology was allowed to advance.

<p>One of the audience members pointed out that a car cannot pass along the 
characteristics of a bad muffler to other cars. She might well have added 
that they also can’t transfer bad-muffler traits to other species, nor pass 
along characteristics that go undetected for a generation or two before 
triggering unforeseen reactions in combination with viruses that have lain 
dormant for millions of years, nor cause problems that cannot be corrected 
-- say, a legacy of birth defects or an unstoppable plague -- even if you 
recall every defective vehicle you produced.

<p>GE’s defenders at the table opined that they're just biologists, not trained 
in the social sciences, and were having to learn how to deal with the 
“emotionalities” around the GE debate. But as the questions from the 
well-behaved audience mounted, the scientists had no opportunity to practice 
grappling with emotions; rather, they seemed to have problems with the 
application of logic.

<p>Dr. Peterson said he was sure corporations would never come to patent and 
own all the seed stock used to grow the world’s food crops. When informed 
that this is, in fact, Monsanto’s stated business plan, he said he didn’t 
doubt the reality of a company _intending_ to do so, but doubted they could 
ever actually achieve it. When pressed as to exactly what would stop a 
transnational giant with billions of dollars in resources -- with which it 
is rapidly buying up seed companies -- from achieving that goal, he said he 
hoped corporations like Monsanto would also be selling non-GE seed from the 
companies they purchased, even though the point of that exercise is to alter 
one characteristic of a seed’s DNA, patent it, own it, and thereby charge 
eternally for its use. He affirmed his faith in the marketplace, as many 
people clearly prefer to buy organic non-GMOs rather than Big Ag’s 
manipulated product, therefore consumer choice would effectively thwart the 
corporate plan for 100% penetration of genetically engineered foods. When 
asked what role consumer choice could have in the matter once GE crops had 
succeeded in cross-pollinating and contaminating non-GE crops, extinguishing 
the organic option, he held his hands up in front of his chest and said he 
was not going to get into a discussion of Monsanto’s business plan because 
that wasn’t his field.

<p>Peterson and Steinmaus both affirmed that a crop ban was not the way to go 
because it will not take food products containing genetically engineered ingredients off supermarket shelves, nor label them, nor fund more safety 
testing. They urged concerned members of the public to instead “call their 
Congressmen.”

<p>On the other side of the table, Dr. Brian Rees gently pointed out that the 
people of San Luis Obispo are not in a position to prod the federal 
government into an action it is not inclined to take, nor bring about a 
national labeling program. “We cannot effect that,” but, he suggested, “If 
you’ve got an oar and some water, you stick your oar in the water and start 
to row. This is what you can do now.”

<p>About two weeks after the Unitarian Center debate, organic farmer Brian Rich 
stood on the sidewalk of Higuera Street in downtown San Luis Obispo and 
watched a protest parade of huge, shiny new tractors and industrial 
agricultural machinery trundle down the street in a show of “family farmer” 
solidarity against the GE crop ban. (Talking points: The measure is “poorly 
written,” “unenforceable,” “economically devastating” and “restricts 
farmers’ freedom of choice.”) None of the giant machines looked like it cost 
less than $100,000, and all looked like they had rolled out the factory 
doors of International Harvester and John Deere earlier that day.

<p>A bemused Rich pulled out his cell phone and called the organizers of the 
SLO GE-Free ballot initiative. “Looks like Monsanto has arrived,” he said.

<p>More than 100 million acres of the American midwest are now covered with GE 
crops. California’s massive agricultural sector, still relatively untouched, 
is the next prize. On November 2, the residents of San Luis Obispo, Butte 
and Marin Counties will let Big Ag know if that golden prize is nearly in 
hand or if an anti-corporate Boston Tea Party, 21st-century West Coast 
division, has commenced. If the latter, then -- as usually happens with 
things that begin in California -- it will surely spread.
