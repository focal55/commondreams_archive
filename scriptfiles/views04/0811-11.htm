<p>George Bush seems prepared to grant Muqtada al-Sadr his wish to become a martyr.


<p>Al-Sadr, the peculiar, defiant young cleric who is leading his militia into battle against the Americans, vows to "defend Najaf until the last drop of my blood."


<p>And I believe him.


<p>The Progressive ran an article in our June issue about al-Sadr, and the guy has a serious martyr complex, according to reporter Nir Rosen. Al-Sadr's father and his great uncle both were killed for resisting Saddam Hussein's regime, and al-Sadr wants to become the "third martyr," as he puts it.


<p>When he accuses Dr. Allawi of behaving like Saddam Hussein, his charge carries some weight, especially among the Shiites, whom Hussein so oppressed.


<p>Al-Sadr is uncouth. "He is very aggressive and tactless," Rosen reported. And other journalists say that his militia has behaved thuggishly in Najaf.


<p>But Bush will be making a bad mistake by making him into a martyr.


<p>Bush would be risking nothing less than all-out insurrection throughout Shiite Iraq if he does so.


<p>The cost in human lives could be enormous.


<p>The cost to Dr. Allawi's puppet government would be great.


<p>And the cost to the U.S. economy could be high, as the oil facilities in Basra might go up in flames.


<p>With oil at $45 a barrel now, just imagine where it would shoot up to then.


<p>The Bush Administration erred by shutting down al-Sadr's newspaper, Al-Hawza, earlier this year. This "only swelled the ranks of his supporters," Rosen reported.


<p>And it will err again by making al-Sadr the third martyr in his family.


<p>The Americans believe that "arresting or killing Muqtada will end the resistance," Rosen wrote. "But that will make no difference. Muqtada knows there were anti-Baathist riots when his father was killed, and the Americans are not as scary as the Baathists were."


<p>Bush has no good option left. But the worst of the bad options is to escalate the war.
