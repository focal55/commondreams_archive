<p>And so it comes out.

<p>Invading Iraq to topple Saddam Hussein was a top priority at U.S. President George Bush's very first National Security Council meeting — seven full months before the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks Bush then cited as a reason for "pre-emptively" disarming Saddam's regime.

<p>"From the very beginning, there was a conviction that Saddam Hussein was a bad person and that he needed to go," former Treasury secretary Paul O'Neill has confirmed in a whistle-blowing appearance on the CBS program 60 Minutes.

<p>"It was all about finding a way to do it. That was the tone of it. The president saying `Go find me a way to do this.'"

<p>O'Neill even saw a secret memo entitled Plan for Post-Saddam Iraq and other related documents.

<p>This won't shock the 7 in 10 Canadians who were unpersuaded by Bush's 9/11 case for war. But it may hurt him with the 6 in 10 Americans who were taken in.

<p>During two years in cabinet, O'Neill "never saw anything I would characterize as evidence of weapons of mass destruction." And Saddam's alleged coziness with Osama bin Laden has never been documented.

<p>These comments have caused a stir, and remind Prime Minister Paul Martin to arm himself with skepticism as he begins to manage tricky Canada/U.S. issues ranging from mad cow to missile defence. This White House has forfeited any right to have its utterances taken on faith.

<p>Right up to the March, 2003, invasion, Bush led the world to think war might be avoided.

<p>"I believe the free world . . . can disarm this man (Saddam) peacefully," he said five months before the troops landed. While the U.S. had wanted "regime change," Bush hinted Saddam could yet redeem himself.

<p>"If he were to meet all the conditions of the United Nations . . . that in itself will signal the regime has changed," Bush said.

<p>Now we know differently. Saddam's fate had been sealed years earlier. Diplomacy was irrelevant.
