Bush is learning the hard way that it's good to have friends, whether it's in 
meeting obligations at home or abroad. <p>The latest illustration is the coming 
flu season's vaccine shortage. <p>After opposing the general importation by Americans 
of cheaper drugs from Canada, the Bush administration is getting a cool reception 
from our northern neighbor about filling that specific gap. <p>Mr. Bush, in his 
final debate with Democratic presidential nominee John Kerry, suggested that Canada 
could be a source of the vaccine. Canada's chief producer informed the U.S. Food 
and Drug Administration that it might be able to help. But the Canadian health 
minister, Ujjal Dosanjh, added the caveat, "If there's anything we can spare." 
<p>In Mr. Bush's debate with Mr. Kerry, the president cited concerns about the 
safety of cheaper Canadian prescription drugs as his reason for opposing a free 
flow of them into this country. That observation certainly hasn't made many Canadians 
eager to share their available supply of flu vaccines with their big brother south 
of the border. <p>The lesson that it's good to have friends is being taught to 
the president in other ways as well. <p>In soliciting more help in the Iraq war, 
Mr. Bush continues to get stiffed by the majority of the world's nations and notably 
by our once-close buddies, France and Germany, in what Defense Secretary Donald 
H. Rumsfeld has dismissively labeled "Old Europe." <p>The president's pre-invasion 
observations about the United Nations risking irrelevance by not embracing his 
regime change adventure also have taken their toll in cooperation from member 
states and from the world body's experienced election-monitoring arm. <p>U.N. 
Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who has labeled the Iraq invasion illegal under 
the U.N. Charter, had until recently declined to dispatch the world organization's 
elections experts to Iraq to prepare and monitor the scheduled January voting 
there, citing inadequate security. <p>Ever since the U.N. headquarters in Baghdad 
was bombed more than a year ago, with the deaths of 17 staffers, including the 
United Nations' chief diplomat to Iraq, Mr. Annan has refused to reopen the mission. 
<p>The secretary-general, however, has now sent a small U.N. team to Baghdad, 
with a limit of 35 experts, while calling for a small volunteer force from member 
states to guard them and make it possible to send more experts. But only tiny 
Fiji offered a handful of troops. <p>Last week, Iraqi Foreign Minister Hoshyar 
Zebari complained that the number of experts was inadequate, noting that the United 
Nations had sent 300 to monitor the referendum on independence in East Timor in 
1999. The top U.N. election official in Iraq, Carlos Valenzuela of Colombia, told 
the Associated Press, however, that preparations for the January elections were 
"on track." <p>Such inhibitions to more sympathy for Bush administration problems 
at home, and the lack of greater cooperation with its objectives abroad, should 
give the president cause to contemplate his relations with the community of nations 
toward which he has so often displayed a high-handed, if not contemptuous, attitude. 
<p>But in the midst of a presidential election campaign, he chooses either to 
exaggerate the scope of his "coalition of the willing" in Iraq or to continue 
playing on right-wing hostility and animosity toward the United Nations as a drag 
on the exercise of U.S. power. <p>All this should serve to illustrate to American 
voters at this critical time the price this country is paying for the unilateral 
posture on foreign policy that has so conspicuously marked Mr. Bush's first term. 
<p>The matter of the flu vaccine shortage is, to be sure, frivolous when compared 
with the damage to American esteem that the president's adventure in Iraq has 
inflicted on the concept of global collective security that saw the world through 
the Cold War. Now, as then, it's good to have friends. <p ALIGN="CENTER">&copy;
