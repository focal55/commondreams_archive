<tr align="left" valign="top"> <td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p>They didn’t think he was good enough to be their
baseball commissioner and follow in the immortal
footsteps of people like Bowie Kuhn and Ford Frick,
but the Major Leagues’ cabal of billionaire owners is
ponying up the dough to keep George W. Bush in the
White House. 

<p>A recent Associated Press review found that the former
Texas Rangers owner has had his palm greased by over
half of the 30 Major League Teams. Seven owners even
hold the distinction of being “Bush Rangers”, meaning
they raised at least $200,000 each, and six are “Bush
Pioneers” signifying $100,000 a piece. 

<p>Bush’s most ardent supporters in the owners box are a
rogue’s gallery of right wing ideologues with the
bucks to back it up. There is Detroit Tigers owner
with his own Republican electoral ambitions Michael
Ilitch, San Francisco Giants owner and Safeway union
buster Peter Magowan, Minnesota Twins owner Carl
Pohlad, best known for trying to contract his own
team, and another figurehead of a decaying empire,
George Steinbrenner.

<p>Owners love Bush for a more complex reason than the
usual ardor billionaires exhibit toward their tax
cutter in chief. Baseball owners all yearn the same
brass ring: they want to extort municipalities and tax
payers to pay the tab for new state of the art
stadiums – and no one ever fronted a stadium swindle
better than George W. Bush.

<p>Stadium deals are the modern day ‘health tonics’ once
sold a century ago to carnival attendees as cure-alls
for everything from gout to syphilis.  Stadiums are
exalted as the difference between a cutting edge city
ready for the globalized world of tomorrow, and a
sleepy town left behind in the dust. The Stadium
pushers ask the question: “Do you want to be nostalgia
or the future? Do you want to exist calcified in a
Thornton Wilder play or be featured in InStyle
magazine?” 

<p>When the Twins’ Pohlad failed to fleece the locals in
a stadium referendum, one of his minions bemoaned that
the Twin Cities would become (heaven forfend) “another
Bismarck, North Dakota”. Even though report after
report from the right wing Cato Institute to the more
centrist Brookings, dismiss stadium funding as an
utter financial flop, owners and cities still dream of
getting working people to pay for play pens they could
barely afford to enter themselves.  

<p>The sad dreams of billionaires are projected onto Bush
who set the standard for large-scale extortion, when
his ownership group got the state of Texas to pay for
The Ballpark in Arlington. 
 
<p>Dubya after an adult life of incompetence and failed
business ventures finally got his dream job, as
managing partner of the Rangers. For an initial
investment of $600,000 – borrowed of course - the then President’s son had to endure the toil of attending home baseball games and smiling a lot for the cameras.

  
<p>But while Bush smirked his forties away, the owners
behind him (think a dozen Dick Cheney’s in ten-gallon
hats) threatened to move the team if the city of
Arlington did not foot the bill for a new park. The
local government caved and in the fall of 1990, they
guaranteed that the city would pay $135 million out of
an estimated cost of $190 million. The remainder was
raised through a ticket surcharge. In other words,
local taxpayers and baseball fans footed the entire
bill 
 
<p>This plan was sold to Arlington voters with Bush's
glad-handing help. At the end of the day, the owners
of the Rangers, including Bush, got a stadium worth
nearly $200 million without putting down a penny of
their own money. 
  
<p>But the scam did not end there. As part of the deal,
the Rangers’ ownership was granted a chunk of land in
addition to the stadium. The land, of course,
increased in value as a result of the stadium's
construction. To make this happen, Democratic Governor
Ann Richards, signed into law an extraordinary measure
that set up the Arlington Sports Facilities
Development Authority (ASFDA), which had the power to
seize privately owned land deemed necessary for
stadium construction. 
As Joe Conason has written, "Never before had a
municipal authority in Texas been given license to
seize the property of a private citizen for the
benefit of other private citizens... On November 8,
1993, with the stadium being readied to open the
following spring, Bush announced that he would be
running for governor. He didn't blush when he
proclaimed that his campaign theme would demand
self-reliance and personal responsibility rather than dependence on government." 

<p>Bush held onto his stake of the team as governor and
by the time he cashed out in 1998, Bush’s return on
his original $600,000 investment in the Rangers was
2,400 percent to a cool $15 million. 

<p>The next time someone complains about the “greediness”
of pro athletes, tell them that if they are that bent
out of shape about someone’s undeserved wealth, they
should a detour to the upper deck and boo outside the
owner’s box.
