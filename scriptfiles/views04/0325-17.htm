<p>Only in Washington.
</p>
<p>
Last night I was at the Radio and Television Correspondents' 
Association Dinner. It's a formal-and-fun affair where 
thousands of media folks assemble at the Hilton for a fancy 
dinner and fab pre- and post-parties. I'm not going to 
denigrate such soirees. I enjoy them. While bookers and 
producers jiggled and jostled on the dance floor and media 
and political celebs dissected the news du jour (this time it 
was Richard Clarke's dramatic appearance before the 9/11 
commission), I was able to chat with former weapons hunter 
David Kay and learn about some troubling developments in 
the intelligence community (more on that down the road). 
And there was free sushi.
</p>
<p>
But an awful you're-all-alone moment came during George 
W. Bush's comments that followed the sit-down dinner. The 
current president is often the honored guest at this annual 
affair, and the audience toasts him in what is supposed to be 
a sign of communal and nonpartisan spirit. And, the tradition 
is, that the president has to be funny; he has to provide us 
with an amusing speech that pokes fun at himself and his 
political foes. After all, political journalists love to see 
politicians engage in self-deprecating humor. Bill Clinton 
was quite good at these performances. Bush seems to enjoy 
them less. Rather than do straight standup, he sometimes 
relies on a humorous slide show, and that was how he 
chose to entertain the media throng this time.</p>
<p>
It's standard fare humor. Bush says he is preparing for a 
tough election fight; then on the large video screens a picture 
flashes showing him wearing a boxing robe while sitting at 
his desk. Bush notes he spends "a lot of time on the phone 
listening to our European allies." Then we see a photo of him 
on the phone with a finger in his ear. There were funny bits 
about Skull and Bones, his mother, and Dick Cheney. But at 
one point, Bush showed a photo of himself looking for 
something out a window in the Oval Office, and he said, 
"Those weapons of mass destruction have got to be 
somewhere."
</p>
<p>
The audience laughed. I grimaced. But that wasn't the end of 
it. After a few more slides, there was a shot of Bush looking 
under furniture in the Oval Office. "Nope," he said. "No 
weapons over there." More laughter. Then another picture of 
Bush searching in his office: "Maybe under here." Laughter 
again. 
</p>
<p>
Disapproval must have registered upon my face, for one of 
my tablemates said, "Come on, David, this is funny." I wanted 
to reply, <i> Over 500 Americans and literally countless Iraqis 
are dead because of a war that was supposedly fought to 
find weapons of mass destruction, and Bush is joking about 
it.</i> Instead, I took a long drink of the lovely white wine that 
had come with our dinner. It's not as if I was in the middle of 
a talk-show debate and <i> had</i> to respond. This was 
certainly one of those occasions in which you either get it or 
don't. And I wasn't getting it. Or maybe my neighbor wasn't.
</p>
<p>
At the end of the slide show, Bush displayed two pictures of 
himself with troops and noted these were his favorites. The 
final photograph was a shot of special forces soldiers--with 
their faces blurred to protect their identities--who were 
posing in Afghanistan where they had buried a piece of 9/11 
debris in a spot that had once been an al Qaeda camp. Bush 
spoke about the prayer the commander had said during the 
burial ceremony and noted he had this photograph hanging 
in his private study.
</p>
<p>
So what's wrong with this picture? Bush was somber about 
the sacrifice being made by U.S. troops overseas. But he 
obviously considered it fine to make fun of the reason he 
cited for sending Americans to war and to death. What an act 
of audacious spin. One poll recently showed that most 
Americans believe he either lied about Iraq's WMDs or 
deliberately exaggerated the case to justify the war. And it is 
undeniable that in seeking public support for the war he 
made many false assertions that went beyond quoting 
intelligence that turned out to be wrong. (I've written about 
this in many other places. If you still don't believe Bush 
mugged the truth, check out this <a 
href="http://www.tompaine.com/feature2.cfm/ID/10101" target="_new">short 
guide</a>.) As the crowd was digesting the delicious 
surf-and-turf meal, Bush was transforming serious scandal 
into rim-shot comedy. 
</p>
<p>
Few seemed to mind. His WMD gags did not prompt a 
how-can-you silence from the gathering. At the after-parties, I 
heard no complaints. Was I being too sensitive? I wondered 
what the spouse, child or parent of a soldier killed in Iraq 
would have felt if they had been watching C-SPAN and saw 
the commander-in-chief mocking the supposed justification 
for the war that claimed their loved ones. Bush told the nation 
that lives had to be sacrificed because Saddam Hussein 
possessed weapons of mass destruction that could be used 
(by terrorists) against the United States. That was not true. 
(And as Kay pointed out, the evidence so far shows these 
weapons were not there in the first place, not that they were 
hidden, destroyed or spirited away.) But rather than 
acknowledge he misinformed the public, Bush jokes about 
the absence of such weapons. 
</p>
<p>
Even if Bush does not believe he lied to or misled the public, 
how can he make fun of the rationale for a war that has killed 
and maimed thousands? Imagine if Lyndon Johnson had 
joked about the trumped-up Gulf of Tonkin incident that he 
deceitfully used as a rationale for U.S. military action in 
Vietnam: "Who knew that fish had torpedoes?" Or if Ronald 
Reagan appeared at a correspondents event following the 
truck-bombing at the Marines barracks in Beirut--which killed 
over 200 American servicemen--and said, "Guess we forgot 
to put in a stop light." Or if Clinton had come out after the 
bombing of Serbia--during which U.S. bombs errantly 
destroyed the Chinese embassy and killed several people 
there--and said, "The problem is, those embassies--they all 
look alike." 
</p>
<p>
Yet there was Bush--apparently having a laugh at his own 
expense, but actually doing so on the graves of thousands. 
This was a callous and arrogant display. For Bush, the 
misinformation--or disinformation--he peddled before the 
war was no more than material for yucks. As the audience 
laughed along, he smiled. The false statements (or lies) that 
had launched a war had become merely another punchline 
in the nation's capital.
