<p>Inside the White House, George Bush watched Saddam Hussein's riveting court appearance on replay. But his spokesman would not say whether the President heard the former Iraqi dictator remark: "This is all theatre to help Bush, the criminal, win the election." 

<p>Right now, Bush needs all the help he can get because the bad news from Iraq is seriously undermining his support.

<p>This weekend Americans celebrate their Independence Day holiday, July 4, with flags flying along the streets of every small town and fireworks lighting up the sky. But the celebratory mood is tempered this year by the news from Iraq. Abroad, support for the US is at a dangerously low ebb and so, too, is support for Bush. Even at home, Americans are doubting the President's ability to handle either Iraq or the war on terrorism.

<p>The reason is "Iraq, Iraq and Iraq", as one pollster put it. American power is under challenge throughout the greater Middle East, its reputation is tarnished by torture allegations, its troops are stretched too thinly and many voters are blaming the President.


<p> This week's handover of power to the new Iraqi Government was supposed to send a message to the world: "Let Freedom Reign," as Bush put it. But the handover was so dogged by security fears, the historic milestone turned into a furtive ceremony behind closed doors that left little room for celebration.

<p>For many Americans, the 140,000 troops left behind - stuck, for the foreseeable future, fighting a bloody insurgency - is deeply troubling. Even though the US forces now report to a new commander, General George Casey, head of the multinational force in Iraq, they are not expected home any sooner.

<p>"From the point of view of the military families, not much has changed," says Julia Pfaff, who runs a big support network for the soldiers' loved ones. "The troops are still on 12-month or 15-month rotation. They get to Kuwait, thinking they are coming home, and are turned around and told to go back."

<p>"I become more pessimistic with every passing day," General Joseph Hoar told the Herald. A former senior commander who worked on Middle East planning, Hoar, like many US military officers who once served in the region, was deeply worried before the war about its impact in the Arab world.

<p>"The invasion of Iraq together with no action on the Israeli-Palestinian issue has only served to inflame the Muslim population and given rise to disputation in other countries. It's more unstable today and I think we're in more danger today than we were before the invasion," he says.

<p>The general's view is now shared by the majority of Americans, who think the Iraq war has increased the threat of terrorism, not decreased it, and that the war has not been worth the human and financial cost.

<p>That cost is increasingly being realized across the country. This week, women such as Pfaff, from the National Military Family Association, were organizing summer camps for the children of soldiers fighting in Iraq. Along with swimming, biking and hiking, the kids are counseled on how to deal with having a parent in the war when every night horrific images flood their TV screens.

<p>"There is a huge need out there," said Pfaff, adding that most of the soldiers, let alone their children, were too young to remember Vietnam. With 860 Americans killed and nearly 5400 wounded, the casualty numbers are beginning to make an impact. "How do they deal with the death of, not only their own family members, but the death of the parent of their best friend?" 

<p>As the insurgency in Iraq exploded in April, the casualties rose. Then came the revelations of abuse from Abu Ghraib prison and support for Bush's handling of the war on terrorism began to fall dramatically, eroding the huge advantage Bush held on national security over his rival, presidential candidate Senator John Kerry.

<p>When voters were by asked by pollsters for NBC television what issue had the greatest personal effect on them, almost 60 per cent said the situation in Iraq and the hostage killings. Iraq out-polled the rise in petrol prices or Ronald Reagan's death. Bush's best hope is that, so far, many voters don't think Kerry would do a better job on either Iraq or the war on terrorism. Support for the two men is now almost dead even.

<p>Having gambled his presidency on Iraq, Bush is now hostage to events there.

<p>Bush's hope is that US-led forces working with the caretaker government of the Prime Minister, Iyad Allawi, can hold the insurgency at bay long enough to allow planning for elections in January. Those elections, backed by the UN, could produce a legitimate government that most Iraqis will support. The promise of those elections, the US hopes, will keep the majority of Iraqis from turning against the Allawi's Government and US troops.

<p>The dilemma is that 90 per cent of Iraqis object to US troops on their soil. Enough Iraqis may tolerate the multinational force until the election. But if the insurgency grows, fueled by the continuing presence of the US troops, this will make holding elections impossible, especially in cities like Fallujah.

<p>Many military analysts in Washington are deeply worried that security will not improve. Hoar believes there is a growing mujahideen in Iraq, similar to the one that expelled the Soviet Union from Afghanistan. He sees two scenarios developing.

<p>"One is that we postpone elections and Allawi becomes our thug and we keep him in power because the alternatives are not good."

<p>The second, he says, is the elections go ahead. "The current people, in my judgment, will be seen as collaborators, and will largely be sidelined, and people [who] have distanced themselves from the US will come to the fore."

<p>The concern with that scenario is that it could provoke a civil war with the Kurds, says Hoar. The Shiite leaders who have distanced themselves from the US are leaders such as Grand Ayatollah Sistani and the radical young cleric Moqtada al-Sadr. Both had objected to US plans to give the Kurds, longtime US allies in Iraq, the autonomous rights and region they are demanding in the north.

<p>If the Kurds don't get the federation they want, "I think the Kurds will talk about secession," says Hoar. "The Israelis are already in Kurdistan training their soldiers in commando raids. So I think it's a very ugly situation and I don't see much chance of it coming together successfully."

<p>This is the nightmare scenario for the Bush Administration. The Kurds have by far the largest and most effective militia, the 75,000-strong Peshmerga. If the Kurds try to secede, taking a good slice of Iraq's oil reserves in Kirkuk, not only will the Shiites and Sunnis react, but so will Turkey. Bush and his senior national security team have given repeated assurances to Turkey that the Kurds will not break away and Iraq will not be allowed to fragment.

<p>Last week at the NATO summit, Bush embraced Turkey as America's most important democratic ally in the Muslim world and insisted Iraq would remain unified. But others are not so sure. "If the Kurds decided to walk away nobody's going to stop them", says Marina Ottaway, a security analyst with the US Carnegie Endowment. "Is Bush going to go to war with the Peshmerga? Is Bush going to try and subdue Kurdistan militarily? I believe the Kurds will play the game as long as they get their autonomy and if they don't get it, they'll walk."

<p>A year after the fall of Saddam, Americans are just coming to terms with the enormous consequences of the invasion of Iraq and the instability it threatens throughout the greater Middle East. Iran is moving into the power gap left by the fall of Saddam, trying to extend its influence inside Iraq. Added to the volatile mix is the violent foreign jihadists such as Musab al-Zarqawi who, with videotaped beheadings of foreigners, want to make Iraq a terrorism magnet for the region, liking up with allies in Saudi Arabia and Jordan.

<p>But Bush is undaunted. Speaking at the end of the NATO summit in Turkey, he insisted Iraq was on its way to becoming "the world's newest democracy" - and just the beginning of a sweeping change in the Middle East.

<p>"I believe that freedom is the future of the Middle East because I believe that freedom is the future of all humanity," Bush said in Istanbul. "This transformation is one of the great and difficult tasks of history. And by our own patience and hard effort, and with confidence in the peoples of the Middle East, we will finish the work that history has given up."

<p>Bush is lauded by supporters for his optimistic vision of bringing democracy to the greater Middle East. But increasingly, critics of his Administration who argue his adventurism is fueling terrorism in the region are eroding his national security credentials.

<p>"The signal illusion from which America has to awake in Iraq and everywhere else is that it serves God's providence," an analyst, Michael Ignatieff, wrote. "In Iraq, America is not the maker of history but its plaything. In the region at large, America is not the hegemon but the hesitant shaper of forces it barely understands."
