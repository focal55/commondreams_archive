<p>I ATTENDED the equivalent of elementary and middle school in Lebanon in the 1960s and '70s. I don't once remember my school organizing an election of any kind -- student-body president, homecoming whatever, head boy or head girl. Nothing. I could blame it on the Jesuit establishment, which tended to be less democratic than Saddam Hussein's Iraq, or on the fact that doing anything other than forced academic labor was unheard of in the schools I attended. But I don't think that's it. The idea of holding elections wouldn't have been taken seriously. What would an election have achieved? A figurehead with embarrassingly meaningless powers, as in the only democracy we knew: Lebanon.

<p>Yet figurehead democracy is the 21st Century's surest trend. The real thing is proving too difficult, too risky, where democracy has barely been heard of. For those who preach it, it's easy enough to fake for television, the weathervane of supposedly functioning democracies.

<p>Afghanistan is a playing field of tribal warlords, Taliban terrorists and regressive customs. But the country's president can still appear before a joint session of the U.S. Congress, as he did on June 15, and speak of his country's "enlightened constitution establishing a democratic Islamic government [that] guarantees equal rights and equal protection for every citizen of our country."

<p>Iraq is occupied and in chaos. But its sovereignty is somehow restored by its occupier and Saddam Hussein is arraigned without a lawyer before a judge, in a country without a judiciary. Meanwhile, American forces train what passes for the Iraqi army to kill other Iraqis. And the president of the United States declares Iraq a democratic example to the rest of the Mideast. Sometimes it appears as if his model is Lebanon. If so, heaven help us.

<p>Since it was carved out of Syria's vague Ottoman borders, in the 1920s, then out of France's colonial maw, in the 1940s, Lebanon has called itself the Mideast's only functioning democracy. That was true enough on paper; there was an elected parliament, an elected president, a judiciary. Whenever my mother or father was asked where they were from, they didn't say Beirut, where we lived, but the towns where they were registered to vote, or at least where their ancestors had registered to vote. My father was therefore from Beit Meri, where Roman legions and Byzantine artisans left a few pretty markers over the centuries. My mother was from Deir-el-Amar, where Christians and Druze have periodically massacred each other, usually under the encouraging eye of one occupying army or another.

<p>Lebanon's president was elected by parliament. Members of parliament were elected by "the people." What I don't remember is an actual election, although one clearly did take place in 1968 and another, the last for 20 years, in 1972. I do remember the violence following the 1972 election, because a brief, lovely period of martial law spared us the daily torture of Jesuit school. Instead of slaving on homework every evening, we distributed scalding coffee and baked treats to the soldiers encamped on our street. When normality returned, so did the usual faces in parliament. The power of incumbency isn't just a Washington phenomenon; in Lebanon, it's a genealogical law.

<p>Still, despite the periodically violent dysfunctions, Lebanon's tribal democracy looked a whole lot better than the tyrannies and theocracies and playboy caliphates surrounding us, which is half the reason the Lebanese so desperately and uselessly fought a civil war between 1975 and 1990. (The reason's other half is plain old contempt for the compromise of peaceful solutions.) Some Lebanese didn't fancy becoming fodder for another garden-variety Arab regime. They didn't completely fail, although the Syrian army occupies Lebanon today, much the way the American military occupies Iraq. The motives may be different, but the method -- which is all that matters to the people being occupied -- is the same: Politically, nothing happens without the occupier's approval.

<p>Maybe that's why we never had elections in school. With the Jesuits' authoritarian nuns and priests shadowing our every move, it would have been as pointless as the Lebanese elections that have since taken place in the shadow of the Syrian guns. Just last month, elections fielding 29,000 candidates in 899 municipalities were held across Lebanon. Is the country any more of a democracy today than it was in 1972? I doubt it. Besides, look who the big winner was in the south and east: Hezbollah, the Shi'ite "Party of God," whose spiritual tendrils reach toward Iraq's Shi'ite extremists, and on toward Tehran.

<p>The American-led coalition in Iraq tried to hold municipal elections last year, then hurriedly canceled them, preferring to hand-pick local leaders, the way it had hand-picked the new "interim" government. It was a more honest way of conceding that in a country without an electoral tradition, a culture of political deliberation, or a registered electorate, there was no sense in faking the impossible. But the honesty, of course, couldn't last.

<p>Speaking in June at a university in Istanbul, President Bush made some interesting comments about how Iraq would be the great model of democracy in the Mideast -- much like Turkey, which he called a "great and stable democracy." He then quoted the Turkish writer Orhan Pamuk. The people of Turkey, Bush said, "understand, as Pamuk has observed, that 'what is important is not [a] clash of parties, civilizations, cultures, East and West.' What is important, he says, is to realize 'that other peoples in other continents and civilizations' are 'exactly like you.' "

<p>It was a nice quote on which to end a speech about democracy. Except that when Pamuk said those words, in a 2002 PBS interview, he was exhorting Americans, not Turks, to understand "that other peoples in other continents and civilizations are actually exactly like you." And Bush's speechwriter left out the end of Pamuk's statement: " . . . and you can learn this through literature. Pay attention to good literature and novels, and do not believe in politicians."

<p>Pamuk doesn't see Turkey as a "great and stable democracy" but, rather, as a nation "governed almost permanently by martial law." And he would have his doubts about Iraq's "becoming the world's newest democracy," as Bush described it. Pamuk is worried about Iraq's turning into another Turkey (or Lebanon, for that matter), where false democracy -- voting as a sham, human and civil rights as a joke -- is held up as an example of progress imposed by the West.

<p>"I am afraid that self-satisfied and self-righteous Western nationalism will drive the rest of the world into defiantly contending that two plus two equals five," Pamuk wrote, with prescience, in the aftermath of 9/11. "Nothing can fuel support for 'Islamists' who throw nitric acid at women's faces so much as the West's failure to understand the damned of the world."

<p>This little story of Bush's speaking of democracy in Istanbul and manipulatively quoting Turkey's most famous writer seems to me as good an illustration as any of the gulf between democracy as we understand it and democracy as it is being imagined, by force, for the Mideast. There is no relationship between the two. There couldn't possibly be. But there's also no need for understanding those differences when you have at your disposal both force and the limitless ability to assert that "two plus two equals five."

<p>When my daughter enters fifth grade, next year, I'll be happy to see her take part in student elections. She's quite interested. And just as an interest in school elections fosters some understanding of the democratic process, it also fosters curiosity about democracy beyond school. At least it does so as far as my daughter is concerned. Then again, her first truly formative experience of democracy in action was the 2000 presidential election. Her mother and I had let her stay up as long as she wanted to find out who the next president would be. She gave up sometime during the night -- as many of us did by late November, when it became obvious that even in the United States, democracy can be relative. There's a gulf right here between the casting of a vote and the meaning of a vote.

<p>With Florida's formative experience behind him, Bush probably sees no irony in declaring Turkey a "great and stable democracy" or in believing in an Iraqi electoral college. Those countries may be trying to be more like us. But we're surely becoming more like them.
