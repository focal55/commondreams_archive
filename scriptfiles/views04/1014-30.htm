Karl Keating says I'm going to hell. And we haven't even met.

<p>Keating runs "Catholic Answers," a conservative lay group based in San Diego. Its Web site, <a href="http://catholic.com/" target="_new">catholic.com</a>, offers a voter's guide to this election, with five "non-negotiable" issues: abortion, euthanasia, embryonic stem-cell research, human cloning and gay marriage.

<p>In a published interview about the guide, Keating has said: "It's a serious sin to vote for moral evils, especially those that are so clearly opposed to the church's teachings."

<p>In other words, vote for a candidate with the wrong views on these issues, and you're well on your way to hell. Since I plan to vote for John Kerry for president, Keating's argument presents me - and millions of Catholics like me - a pretty bleak prognosis for the life to come.

<p>Catholic Answers doesn't actually mention President George W. Bush or Sen. John Kerry, but you'd have to be pretty obtuse not to get the idea. Other interest groups aren't so delicate. For one example, check out the nasty Kerry cartoon on the National Rifle Association's Political Victory Fund site, which brags about defeating Al Gore in 2000 and slobbers over the chance to bury Kerry.

<p>Or take a look at the Natural Resources Defense Council site, which isn't a voter's guide, but offers an overwhelmingly negative assessment of Bush's polluter-friendly record on the environment.

<p>Not everyone, of course, has the resources of the NRA or the NRDC. Take the folks who created the <a href="http://votingcatholic.org/" target="_new">votingcatholic.org</a> site. Though I've never exchanged a word with Karl Keating, I do know some of these smart and committed young people, through the College of the Holy Cross and Pax Christi, the international Catholic peace movement.

<p>These are not crazies or heretics. They take their lead, in fact, from this quote from the nation's Catholic bishops: "The Christian faith is an integral unity, and thus it is incoherent to isolate some particular element to the detriment of the whole of Catholic doctrine. A political commitment to a single isolated aspect of the Church's social doctrine does not exhaust one's responsibility towards the common good."

<p>Right near the top of the <a href="http://votingcatholic.org/" target="_new">Web site</a> is a link to the bishops' full document, a long, thoughtful treatise on this election, "Faithful Citizenship: A Catholic Call to Political Responsibility."

<p>The <a href="http://votingcatholic.org/" target="_new">Voting Catholic site</a> presents the issues and the positions of Bush, Kerry and the bishops. It lets you take a quiz, to see how close your positions are to those of the candidates and the church. And it examines a far broader swath of issues than Keating's site.

<p>Under the heading of life, for example, Voting Catholic includes abortion, assisted suicide and stem-cell research, just as Keating does. But it also includes the death penalty, avoidance of war, nuclear weapons, the global arms trade, land mines and others. And it examines issues under the headings of family, justice and solidarity. It's an excellent site to help Catholics decide.

<p>In this election, which many consider the most defining since 1932, voters should not make up their minds on only one issue.

<p>To be fair to Keating, his voter's guide does offer an exception: "In some political races, each candidate takes a wrong position on one or more issues involving non-negotiable moral principles. In such a case you may vote for the candidate who takes the fewest such positions or who seems least likely to be able to advance immoral legislation, or you may choose to vote for no one."

<p>Keating would argue that only his five issues are truly non-negotiable, but many Catholics also include such matters as war and peace, the slaughter of civilians, the death penalty, and caring for the poor.

<p>So, even by Keating's standards, I feel comfortable that Kerry is far less dangerous to human life than Bush. Even Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, the church's chief doctrinal officer, gives comfort to Catholics like me, who don't like Kerry's pro-choice stand: He says Catholics can vote for pro-choice candidates, if they vote despite that position, not because of it, and if there are "proportionate reasons." My reasons: Bush has averted few, if any, abortions, but killed thousands of Iraqi civilians.

<p>Bottom line: There are plenty of one-issue voter's guides, but Catholics and non-Catholics alike should devote the time to studying a wider array of issues before voting.
