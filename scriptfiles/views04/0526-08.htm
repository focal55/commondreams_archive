<p>       Common Dreams is a wonderful resource for
progressives.  I am, nevertheless, occasionally
surprised by what the editors of Common Dreams deem
progressive content.
<p>  Take, for example, Andy Rooney's latest 60 Minutes
soliloquy titled "<a href="http://www.commondreams.org/views04/0524-12.htm">Our Darkest Days Are Here</a>," the text
of which appeared in the Views section of Common
Dreams on May 24, 2004.  Far from advancing ideas that
could be described as forward thinking, Mr. Rooney's
piece reflects much of what is wrong with the way that
we, as Americans, view ourselves and our country.

<p>  	Americans' vision of the present is very much a
function of our conception of past events.  However,
many, if not most, sectors of the domestic population
suffer from what can loosely be described as a kind of collective amnesia when it comes to U.S. history. 
Members of the mainstream media and, separately, the intellectual elite are particularly subject to this rule and, in fact, serve to reinforce it by disseminating information and opinions based upon selective memory and extreme myopia.  

<p>    Enter Mr. Rooney, whose aforementioned commentary
begins with a description of some of the "great times
in American history."  One can surmise from his
selections that, in Mr. Rooney's opinion, times of war
(he mentions the Revolutionary War and World War II)
and mass killing (the slaughter of Native Americans
subsequent to Columbus reaching the continent) are
great.  "Putting Americans on the moon," also ranks
high on Mr. Rooney's great times list.  Forget about
advancing the progress of the human race - if that is
indeed what our moon landing accomplished - what is
important is that Americans landed on the moon first. 
  

<p>    Besides reveling in the often violent glory of
America's past, Mr. Rooney suggests that the history
of America was devoid of moral transgressions prior to
the emergence of the evidence that U.S. soldiers
tortured Iraqi prisoners.  Indeed, Mr. Rooney would
have us believe that, "[o]ur darkest days up until now
have been things like presidential assassinations, the
stock market crash in 1929, Pearl Harbor, and
9-11...."  Dark days, therefore, do not include the
genocide of the Native Americans, an event which
involved the extermination of (conservatively) eleven
million to fourteen million human beings. 
Undoubtedly, Native Americans do not consider the day
Columbus "got here" one of the "great times in
American history."

<p>  The darkest days in America also do not encompass,
from Mr. Rooney's viewpoint, slavery and the slave
trade, the oppression of minorities, the extirpation
of approximately two million Vietnamese and fifty
eight thousand Americans during the Vietnam War, the
deaths of hundreds of thousands of Iraqis (if not
millions) in the wake of American economic sanctions
directed against Iraq and, moreover, the killing of
untold numbers of Iraqi civilians during the first and
second Gulf wars.  These few examples are but a tiny
smattering of the ills that are an indelible part of
our past and present.  Suffice it to say, however,
that Mr. Rooney is unconcerned by such trifling
details of American history.

<p>  Instead, he advises us that, "[t]he day the world
learned that American soldiers had tortured Iraqi
prisoners belongs high on the list of worst things
that ever happened to our country."  The torture
itself was not so much the problem, therefore, but
rather the fact that it came to light and tarnished
Americans' otherwise pristine reputation abroad.  Bad
things, furthermore, happen to America, but our
country is never guilty of misdeeds.  For Mr. Rooney,
and others who think like him, America is by
definition incapable of doing harm; Americans, like
their system of government, are wholly just and
upright.    We may have a few rotten apples here and
there, including the "bad" soldiers who tortured Iraqi prisoners and, perhaps, some of their higher ups, but otherwise Americans are faultless.  Any action taken by the United States, therefore, must be taken for the good of mankind.

<p>  Americans' self-image has always been comprised of
these principles.  Despite Mr. Rooney's assertions to
the contrary, it is an image that has long been at
odds with the way that the U.S. is regarded in other
nations of the world. 
 
<p>  We cannot continue to exist under the delusion that
the United States is a benevolent entity that uses its
vast resources for "good."  Americans would, in this
respect, do well to pay attention to Noam Chomsky, who
has explained that states are not moral actors;
nations behave according to the needs of those who
wield power and, in the U.S., as in the rest of the
world, power is equated with money.  It is the
responsibility of Americans, therefore, to educate
themselves about the past, to seek diverse sources of
news coverage, and to reflexively question any
information put before them - regardless of the source
- before accepting it as truth.

<p>  	Mr. Rooney is not being overly dramatic when he says
that our civilization is in decline.  The
deterioration, however, has been taking place for a
long time.  The process may have been accelerated of
late and made more obvious than it ordinarily is, but
the rot has always been there.  It is not, though,
simply the United States that is in jeopardy but the
entire human race. 

<p>  If humans are to survive then all of us, Americans
and citizens of other countries alike, must shed
nationalism and our focus on the individual and turn
to a more collective worldview.  If, instead, we
choose to grasp at a vision of the past that is
largely fantastical, we will find ourselves facing
graver and graver circumstances because the past is
what brought us to where we currently stand: a few
steps away from the brink of oblivion.
