<p>The poor Iraqi people. President George Bush has repeatedly told them that the handover of power is another landmark in their arduous and bloody journey to achieving democracy, prosperity and viability. Yet the event cannot bring any change in the miserable lives of a majority of them.

<p>The Iraqi interim government is essentially an outgrowth of the United States-installed Iraqi Governing Council. It suffers from the same lack of legitimacy, credibility and enforceability that rendered its predecessor ineffective. The transfer of "sovereignty" to it will amount to nothing more than symbolism on the part of the Bush Administration.

<p>The failure of the US and its occupying partners to substantiate their original justification for the invasion and to handle post-Saddam Hussein Iraq effectively has left them with little credibility to sell their occupation, either to the Iraqis or the international community. The spectacle of abuse and humiliation of Iraqi prisoners by US and, to some extent, British forces has weakened even the Bush Administration's belated moral argument for occupation.


<p>The Iraq conflict began as part of the agenda of a small group of neo-conservatives in the Bush Administration, who wanted to reshape the Muslim Middle East and radical political Islam according to their vision and geopolitical preferences. However, they failed to understand the complex nature of Iraq's culture and society, and that in the absence of an authoritarian central power, elements from each of the country's three main micro-societies - the Arab Shia majority, and the Arab Sunni and non-Arab Kurdish minorities - could violently challenge the occupying powers and one another in pursuit of diverse interests. 

<p>The war planners could not see that reconciliation between the micro-societies and power-sharing as a prelude to generating a democratic polity in Iraq could be achieved only on a long-term basis. The possibility that the invasion could generate a formidable Iraqi resistance, and enhance anti-US anger in the Arab-Muslim world, did not seem to enter the planners' calculus, either. 

<p>Further, Washington could not see that ultimately it would not be able to dictate outcomes according to US geopolitical preferences without radicalizing the Shia and enabling a young and ambitious cleric like Moqtadar al-Sadr to become a serious embarrassment to the occupying forces. The Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani has so far managed to restrain the majority of the Shia from engaging in active opposition. But this does not mean that he is any less firm than al-Sadr in his commitment to the goal of Shia political dominance. He expects the Shia to prevail in any democratic election, and would not accept anything short of a determining Shia role in Iraqi politics.

<p>With more than 80 per cent of Iraqis now wanting the occupying forces to leave, the Bush Administration's claims to moral virtue, political decency and leadership in the struggle for democracy and human rights do not ring true to most Arabs and Muslims. What they see is Washington's double standard, its support for dictatorial regimes in the Arab world and Israel's brutal occupation of Palestinian lands. Dangerously, an increased number of Arabs and Muslims today identify with Osama bin Laden's causes. Many look to him for salvation, rather than to Washington for democratizing their societies.

<p>Whatever one's perception of the Iraqi resistance, it has emerged with a role beyond Iraq. It has in many ways defined the limits of US power. It has enabled the United Nations to prove its relevance in the face of the Bush Administration's pre-war condemnation of it as irrelevant. It has strengthened the position of Iran under Islamic conservatives as a regional player. It has rendered remote any American use of force against Syria, and left Israel's regional position as vulnerable as ever.

<p>It has dealt a serious blow to the agenda of the US neo-conservatives, putting them on the defensive, and forced Bush to return to the UN for help and to opt for more multilateralism. Bush has also realized that the Iraqi resistance has intersected with growing domestic opposition from within and without his Administration to the neo-conservatives, and that if he wants to arrest his slide in the opinion polls he needs to distance himself from their approach. All this can only play into the hands of the Iraqi resistance, and al-Qaeda and its associates.

<p>The US is now involved in a very damaging war. The results of leaving Iraq sooner may prove to be as damaging as those of staying in for the long haul. If it opts for an accelerated pull-out, this could spell the end of US political dominance in the Middle East, and reflect very badly on the efforts of the US and its allies in Afghanistan and the war on terrorism. 

<p>If it stays on course "for as long as necessary", neither Bush nor his successors will be able to wear the costs without sinking the US into an Iraq syndrome similar to that of Vietnam. The futility of the Iraq war is now set to haunt the US and its allies for a long time.
