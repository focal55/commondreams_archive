<p> Listen closely to the rancorous clamor over Mad Cow, and you might hear a slight slurping sound. Listen more closely and you might hear an ominous tidal flow. Every day in the United States, some 53 teaspoons of sugar slide down into our children’s bodies, promising a health epidemic of unimaginable proportions. While schools across the nation vend osteoporosis and type-2 diabetes, as a substitute for legitimate sources of funding, cash registers will ring a bitter sweet tale. While diabetes may be good for Eli Lily, now embarking on creating giant insulin producing sites (3rd quarter sales of insulin in 1999 alone were $357 million alone for the $75 billion pharmaceutical giant), parents, citizens and educators are enacting a “leave no sugared child behind” legacy.

 

   <p>   If a society is gauged by its commitment to children, the educational communities’ tacit and complicit alliance with peddlers of illness is testament to misplaced moral responsibilities. Do the math yourself: 76.3 % of schools nationwide now have soda machines, only 19% of students in high school are now physically active for 20 minutes or more, five days a week in PE and 20% of U.S. children are now obese. In the next decade, schools might have to vend insulin and calcium pills in an attempt to intercede in the intentional poisoning of millions of children. Poisoning may be a strong accusation, yet the scientific data is seemingly irrefutable and even creates a more damning case for hitting the panic button.

 

   <p>    Intake of sugar necessitates that our body goes on battle alert to neutralize an additional acid load generated by this innocuous white powder robbed of its natural minerals by the refining process. The body steals minerals such as calcium from the bones and teeth to return blood to its acid-base balance. Compound the intake of sugar at school with the array of sugar- laden products at home ranging from yogurt and ketchup to pasta and soup products, and the children’s liver swells to compensate. Bacteria in their stomachs whither as they are assaulted by sugar via pop and candy: putting another bodily process into jeopardy.

 

    <p>   Just ask any teacher who witnesses the “highs’ and “lows” of morning consumption of pop by their students and ask them about academic performance. Sugar inhibits vitamin B and insulin levels drop, kids play a sort of “roller coaster ride” on their way to a lifetime of hurt. No wonder some youth detention centers have banned sugary treats with wonderful results, leading to less erratic emotional behavior. Maybe we don’t have to prescribe Ritalin in so many schools: just ban vending machines and null and void pop contracts.

 

   <p>   Parents also must take a share of the blame: with over 20% of one and two year olds consuming soda pop in the United States. With PepsiCo logos on baby bottles and Coca-Cola currently making deals to do the same, toddlers are defenseless to the outright predator instincts of sugar brokers. Kids enter school thinking that soda pop and candy rank up there with other warm and fuzzy American values. They see Coca-cola and Harry Potter, they see vending machines at school and they even go door- to- door selling candy for everything from athletics to music programs.

 

 <p>     Don’t look to the Bush Administration for help any time soon. His administration is fighting a World Health Organization’s “blueprint to combat obesity.” Bush and many senators receive more than a spoon full of sugar from the sugar industry: they receive blood money, millions of dollars yearly. With President Bush embracing a global epidemic based junk food diet, how can average citizens and parents make a difference?

 

  <p>    Embrace the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) call to ban sale of soda pop in schools. Do not allow your child to partake in any vending of candy or sugar- laden products in the name of “fund raising.” Ask your local school board for time on the next board meeting. Don’t be afraid to speak out for your children, you can go to Commercial Alert.org for all the data you need. Employ the help of local pediatricians to advocate on behalf of more nutritional foods in your school district. Insist that vending of fruit, pure fruit juices and milk be the dominant product in schools. Encourage student run lunch and snack programs that bring organic foods and soy products into “fashion.” Lastly, bring forth light on these “deals with the devil” contracts that provide fractional funding to schools and create windfalls for multinationals.

 

  <p>    Public schools cannot be used to make children captive audiences and customers of the peddlers of sugar. Listen again, the upcoming elections will bring with it talk of <I>“values” and “moral obligations.” Don’t let spineless school administrators; timid politicians and aggressive corporations sweet-talk our children any more.
