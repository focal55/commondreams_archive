<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p>Iris Chang, the 36-year-old author of "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0140277447/commondreams-20/ref=nosim/" target="_new"><em>The Rape of Nanking: The 
Forgotten Holocaust of World War II</em></a>," immersed herself a decade ago in the 
stories of those who had survived the period in 1937 when Japanese soldiers 
invaded a city in China and slaughtered 300,000 people. More recently, Chang 
interviewed survivors of the Bataan Death March. After listening to the 
stories of American survivors in Kentucky, she suffered a breakdown and was 
hospitalized for three days. She returned home to the Bay Area, where, despite 
therapy and medication, she committed suicide Nov. 9.
<P>Compassion fatigue. Secondary trauma. Vicarious traumatization. These are 
the terms used to describe what happens to empathic people like Chang who lose 
their way home after bearing witness to stories of man's inhumanity to man. 
After five years of working as a psychiatric nurse consultant on a trauma unit,
I began experiencing nightmares, palpitations, shortness of breath and an 
ever-growing fear for my children's safety. Then, I attended a trauma 
conference where I heard the term "vicarious traumatization" for the first 
time. My symptoms became understandable and I knew that a break from my work 
was necessary.
<P>Trauma professionals talk about exposure to traumatic events in terms of 
"dose." Recent developments in trauma research allow us to map changes in the 
brain that occur as a result of trauma. Even secondary exposure, especially 
the strong dose that Chang accumulated over time, may cause observable changes.
Cops, firefighters, therapists, reporters and frontline health-care workers 
are also at high risk.
<P>Treatments are available. Taking steps to reduce stress before symptoms 
appear is even better. This includes a supportive work environment, harmony at 
home, regular exercise, balancing work with pleasurable activities and time 
spent with friends, especially ones who make you laugh.
<P>Mourners said that Chang was a person who "felt others' pain intensely" 
and that she "wouldn't take time off." Another said, "For Iris, no problem was 
unsolvable." Maybe that's what happened. Iris Chang confronted the reality of 
evil in our world and died trying to do something about it. I imagine how the 
voices haunted her nights and trespassed into her days; how each story pulled 
her in deeper; how she made herself bear the unbearable in order to give words 
to unfathomable feelings; how she absorbed the suffering of others so that we 
may learn to be better human beings.
<P>The only problem is that we don't want to listen. We don't want to hear. 
We don't want to believe. Talking about feelings has never been the fashion in 
this country. We would rather medicate them or drown them in alcohol. We are 
not taught how to care for the emotional needs of others. We are uncomfortable 
when someone we know expresses pain or sorrow. We avoid such situations 
because we fear we will say the wrong thing or become emotionally overwhelmed 
ourselves. But acknowledgement, care and comfort are what people who bear 
witness need. Sometimes though, even the cushion of a loving family and 
devoted friends isn't enough to rescue those who have descended deep into the 
pain of others.
<P>Iris Chang illuminated the lives of many people, but in the process, she 
lost the light of life within herself. Like the firefighters at ground zero 
after the Sept. 11 attacks, she sifted through the remains of tragedy without 
a break, without concern for her own mental health. We need to nurture people 
like her who have dedicated their lives to seeking truth and in so doing, risk 
losing their way home. We must offer them respite from their work, feed them 
with appreciation, listen to their feelings and drag them away when they get 
too close to the maw of despair.
