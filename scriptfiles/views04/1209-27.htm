<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p>If the United States were a Third World country, our Nov. 2 election 
would not pass certification by international monitors. As former President 
Carter has explained on National Public Radio, we lack a central, nonpartisan 
election commission to guarantee fair and equal treatment of all voters 
nationwide, our candidates do not receive free and equal access to the media 
to deliver their message, voting procedures are not uniform throughout the 
county, and there is not a "paper trail" available in all cases to guarantee 
an honest recount where called for.
<P>To insure against fraud in the counting and reporting of election results,
international monitors depend on the same kind of election-day exit polls as 
were conducted in the United States. Unlike earlier polls that attempt to 
predict a future election outcome, which are therefore subject to all manner 
of potential errors, exit polls estimate the characteristics of a population 
which has already voted. It is as if you had a huge jar of M&Ms and you took 
out several handfuls at random, counted the proportion of each color in your 
sample, and knowing the total number of M&Ms in the jar, used these results to 
estimate how many were red, brown, green or yellow in the jar as a whole. If 
your sample was reasonably large and randomly drawn from the jar, it would 
estimate these totals with a high degree of accuracy.
<P>In our own recent presidential election, exit polls were conducted 
nationwide for the media by two of the world's most respected professional 
exit-polling firms: Edison Media Research and Mitofsky International. 
Pollsters were sent to carefully selected, representative polling locations 
throughout each state. They then interviewed about every fifth voter emerging 
from the polling place during random periods throughout the day. Total samples 
from each state were large  --  about 2,000 or more voters  --  and the error 
of estimate was small  --  plus or minus less than half of 1 percent in 99 
cases out of 100.
<P>By agreement among the networks, the results of these exit polls were not 
reported to the public on election day, so as not to influence the ongoing 
voting process or lead to embarrassing "premature" calling of outcomes by the 
networks, as happened for Florida in 2000. But they were shared with  --  and 
believed by  --  campaign officials and by the candidates themselves, and they 
were widely reported over the Internet. As we now know, on the basis of these 
exit polls, Kerry was expected to win.
<P>Then the "actual" tallies began to pour in.
<P>This was the "November surprise." In state after state, Kerry saw his 
expected lead shrink or vanish. And when he lost Ohio  --  which exit polls 
estimated he would win by 4.5 percent  --  he "lost" the election. According 
to Steven Freeman, who teaches research methods at the University of 
Pennsylvania, for 10 exit polls among the 11 battleground states he analyzed 
to be this far off as a result of random error, particularly when all 
discrepancies favored Bush, is essentially impossible.
<P>As officials testified this week at a forum called by Rep. John Conyers 
Jr.,  D-Mich., and for an investigation by Congress' General Accounting Office,
electronic voting theft is incredibly easy. There have also been widespread 
reports of election irregularities  --  more than 38,000 nationwide at last 
count, according to Verified Voting Foundation's election-incident reporting 
system. Most of those irregularities appear to favor Republicans.
<P>If this were an election taking place in a Third World dictatorship, or a 
former part of the Soviet Union (Georgia and Ukraine, for recent examples) 
people would be in the streets screaming "fraud" and demanding the president's 
resignation.
<P>Democratic pundits have been wringing their hands, trying to figure out 
the best tactics for future victory. The answer is simple: Make sure every 
eligible voter gets a chance to vote, and that every vote gets recorded, 
counted and accurately reported  --  and that a secure paper trail exists to 
ensure the validity of any required recount.
<P>Suspicions of election fraud undermine the very foundation of our 
democracy and need to be addressed.
