<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->Since the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks, 
      millions of words have been written about the "terrorists in our midst" 
      and what law enforcement agencies are doing to fight it. However, few 
      questioned whether an overzealous American government was compromising 
      American civil liberties. 
      
<p>In the days and weeks following Sept. 
      11, the FBI rounded up and imprisoned thousands of immigrants and visitors 
      to the United States. 
      
<p>Now, in a new report titled "<i><a href="http://www.aclu.org/SafeandFree/SafeandFree.cfm?ID=17160&c=207" target="_new">Worlds Apart,</a></i>" the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) has documented what 
      happened to 13 of these "other victims" of the Sept. 11 attacks, and to 
      their families. 
      
<p>The story of how the U.S. government 
      responded to Sept. 11 remains relatively little known. The short version, 
      from the ACLU report, is that the United States: "incarcerated petitioners 
      in degrading and inhumane conditions. Although the immigrants generally 
      were detained on non-criminal immigration charges, many were kept in cells 
      for 23 hours a day and were made to wear hand and leg shackles when 
      leaving their cells. 
      
<p>"Some were kept in solitary confinement 
      for extended periods with no explanation. Lights were left on 24 hours a 
      day, immigrants were denied the use of blankets, and many were denied 
      telephone calls and visits with family members." 
      
<p>For many, says the ACLU, "the nightmare 
      began with their arrest. FBI and immigration officials dragged some people 
      out of their houses in the middle of the night in front of frightened 
      wives and children. Others were picked up for being in the wrong place 
      [like the man] arrested by agents who had come looking for his roommate 
      but took him instead. Still others were arrested after routine traffic 
      stops. For many, it would be days before they could contact their families 
      with their whereabouts and weeks before they could access legal help. The 
      government refused to release the names of people it had detained. Behind 
      bars, many suffered from harassment and even physical abuse." 
      
<p>None of the thousands of people 
      detained by what was then still the Immigration and Naturalization Service 
      were found guilty of any terrorism-related offenses or connected in any 
      way with the Sept. 11 attacks. The ACLU added: "Yet the Justice Department 
      website still boasts that hundreds of immigrants 'linked to the Sept. 11 
      investigation have been deported'." 
      
<p>The report charges that "the 
      government's unlawful policies had profound effects not only on the people 
      who were unlawfully imprisoned but also on their families and communities. 
      Families were torn apart. Communities were shattered." And the stories 
      told in this report are just a small sample. There are hundreds of similar 
      ones that haven't been recounted. 
      
<p>The stories of the 13 deportees vary 
      widely, as they all come from different backgrounds. However, the report 
      also observed that "the stories of these men are similar in important 
      ways. 
      
<p>"All came to the United States seeking 
      a better life for themselves and their families. All were Muslim, from 
      South Asia or the Middle East. After Sept. 
      
<p>11, all were caught in a government 
      dragnet that swept up hundreds of Muslims indiscriminately. 
      
<p>"And all were denied basic rights 
      normally afforded to those detained in the United States and other 
      democratic countries." Many were "deported to countries where they haven't 
      lived in years, and where unemployment rates are high and salaries are 
      low." 
      
<p>The ACLU report concluded: "In the 
      weeks and months after Sept. 11, the people whose stories are told in this 
      report did not count. The United States government arrested them without 
      suspicion, imprisoned them without charge, and abused them without 
      consequence. All of this took place in secret. To this day, the government 
      still refuses to release the names of the people who were imprisoned." 
      
<p>The architect of this Bush 
      administration policy of mass deportations, Attorney General John 
      Ashcroft, is on his way out. In his recent farewell speech, he 
      congratulated Justice Department staffers for safeguarding American civil 
      liberties. But Ashcroft's abysmal record shows a different picture. More 
      worrying is that the man nominated to be his successor is White House 
      Counsel Alberto Gonzales. He is the author of the now infamous memo 
      justifying torture of prisoners of war and calling the Geneva Conventions 
      "quaint" and obsolete. It is unlikely that Gonzales will be paying much 
      attention to due process where immigrants and foreign visitors are 
      concerned. 
      
<p>After Sept. 11, the U.S. government 
      acted out of perhaps understandable fear. It enacted legislation that 
      placed traditional civil liberties protections on the backburner. Security 
      was - and remains - paramount. As in other periods of crisis in America, 
      the government went too far. While the U.S. constitution has always 
      managed to get the pendulum to swing back, this time may be more 
      difficult. America has never before confronted an open-ended threat from 
      Islamist terrorists, which has made the government especially willing to 
      continue favoring security over civil liberties. 
      
<p>The restoration of that balance will 
      require proactive public policies that, among other things, recognize that 
      it was immigrants who built America, and that civil liberties have always 
      belonged to citizens and non-citizens alike. 
      
<p>Sadly, this is unlikely to happen on 
      George W. Bush's watch.</P>
