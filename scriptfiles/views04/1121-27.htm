<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p>The massive corporate wave of crime, fraud and abuse rolls on, is 
undeterred by regular exposes in the business media itself. My favorite 
corporate crime journal (aka the Wall Street Journal) is a daily 
newspaper that never runs out of material.

<p>Daily Journal headlines recently alerted readers to: (1) “Lucent Faces 
Bribery Allegations,” (2) “Companies Sue Union Retirees to Cut Promised 
Health Benefits,” (3) “How Drug’s Rebirth as Treatment for Cancer Fueled 
Price Rises,” reporting one capsule for $29 compared to a price of seven 
cents in Brazil, (4) “A Retired Maid’s Questions About her ATM Card Led 
Lawyer to Georgia Scandal,” (5) “At Cigna, Some Patients Found Conflict 
of Interest in System,” (6) “As Corporate Fines Grow, SEC Debates How 
Much Good They do.” (7) From the Associated Press – “Calif. Insurance 
Chief Sues Four Insurance Giants in Kickback Probe.”
Also in the headlines are the pharmaceutical companies led by Merck’s 
deadly fiasco with Vioxx.

<p>In the midst of the daily revelations – most of which produce no 
corrective behavior – the Congress and state legislatures are paid to 
sleep through it all. Aside from a modest new law called Sarbanes/Oxley 
designed to deter some of the big accounting firm scandals, there is no 
corporate reform drive on Capitol Hill, and no demands for larger 
prosecution budgets for the Justice Department. During the recent 
political campaigns by the two major parties, there was no focus on a 
continuing pattern of corporate outlaws damaging the health and safety 
of the people and draining trillions of dollars from investors, worker 
pensions and 401Ks.

<P>There is, however, activity among business lobbies, like the U.S. 
Chamber of Commerce, to water down law enforcement, weaken the Sarbanes 
law, block the Securities and Exchange Commission’s efforts to protect 
investors, and make it harder for the defrauded to have their full day 
in court.

The political and legal systems are not just crumbling before these 
business lobbies; they are even failing to articulate a comprehensive 
‘law and order’ philosophy toward large multinational corporations 
playing one national jurisdiction off of another one across the globe. To demonstrate the untapped potential for prosecution, note that New 
York state attorney general Eliot Spitzer is accomplishing his moves 
against Wall Street with fewer than 85 attorneys in his corporate crime 
division. There are corporate law firms defending these culprits that 
each have over 1000 attorneys in their offices.

<p>Inside the government’s law enforcement agencies are officials and 
commissioners who can barely serve out their few years before accepting 
lucrative offers to join the other side. Even in office they concoct 
excuses for voting against significant corporate fines on the grounds 
that such penalties would punish shareholders and diminish the value of 
corporate shares. (SEC Commissioners Paul Atkins and Cynthia Glassman 
tried this absurdity recently).

<p>All this, along with the corporate domination of our government, argues 
for a more comprehensive approach to “controlling corporations and 
restoring democracy.” These words comprise the subtitle of a new book 
called <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1576753093/commondreams-20/ref=nosim/" target="_new">The People’s Business – the report of the Citizen Works Corporate 
Reform Commission</a></em>.

<p>Having founded Citizen Works, I am pleased to trumpet this endeavor 
written by Lee Drutman and Charlie Cray as a long overdue, timely and 
fundamental challenge to the judicial usurpation of our Constitution 
which have given these companies – that are artificial entities and not 
human beings or voters – almost all the rights possessed by real people. 
There can be no equal justice under the law between you and Pfizer or 
General Motors under such equivalence.

<p>The steady and accelerating erosion of democracy by the corporate 
supremacists was not envisioned by the framers of our constitution. 
There is no mention of the “Corporation” in that founding document 
ratified well before the emergence of the modern corporation in the 19th 
century. The framers were far more worried about too much governmental 
power and could not foresee the many uses of that very power by 
corporations against the interests of “we the people.”

<p>Even the owners of the large corporation – the shareholders – do not 
control their company. It is a highly autocratic structure controlled by 
the officers and their rubber stamp boards of directors. Making 
corporations into the servants of people, not their masters, is the 
challenge of <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1576753093/commondreams-20/ref=nosim/" target="_new">The People’s Business</a></em> (Berrett-Koehler Publishers 
(1-800-929-2929).

<P>The many-splendored ways that this work meets this challenge can open up 
a major public debate. An exciting public inquiry is needed by the 
workers, consumers, small taxpayers, voters and various communities of 
citizens who are now being driven backwards despite the overall 
conventional economic growth that has enriched the few against the well 
being of these people.
