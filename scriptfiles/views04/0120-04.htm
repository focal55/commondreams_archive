<p>Iraq changes everything.

<p>Without it, we'd be having an interesting discussion about George W. Bush's tax cuts and whether his deficit spending threatens the nation's economic well-being.

<p>We'd be arguing over his environmental and energy policies.

<p>We'd be debating his court appointments, his immigration policies, the future of Social Security, the state of public schools, health insurance coverage and whether the federal government should influence personal choices like abortion, marriage and the right to die.

<p>In other words, we'd be thrashing out the important topics of a typical presidential campaign, to discern which candidate has the best ideas for America.

<p>But a deafening roar is drowning out the customary din of political conversation.

<p>High stakes

<p>America under Bush started a war, killed thousands of people, sacrificed hundreds of her own valiant soldiers and conquered a soveriegn nation, using the justification that this foreign government participated in a heinous terrorist attack and posed an immediate and serious danger to America.

<p>Which wasn't true.

<p>And now I'm having a dreadful time paying attention to any of the other relevant issues of this campaign. What can compare to the single-handed destruction of the legacy America spent 227 hard years crafting -- a commitment to justice, principle and the rule of law?

<p>Not much makes me weep. I wept on Sept. 11, 2001, crumpled in a heap before a television. But I also wept on March 19, 2003, the day Bush invaded Iraq, transforming America into the Roman Empire under Caesar.

<p>Principle guides opinion

<p>I've wondered lately why I wasn't caught up in the American bloodlust to strike at someone, anyone, to avenge Sept. 11; why I recoil so reflexively when I hear war defenders suggest that America is entitled to do whatever it wants to further its own interests, principle be damned. The explanation, I've decided, is personal.

<p>A belief in principle sustained at least five generations of my family as they trod a torturous path from slavery to -- well, to me. Despite pressures to lose faith, my forebears persevered, believing that one day, their descendants would know liberty, dignity and opportunity regardless of race. And they believed it would happen in America.

<p>I am a member of the generation for whom they sacrificed. For me, ''principle'' is not a word. It's life, blood, mother's milk -- it's why I had a chance to be.

<p>There is a time for war, but for America -- because we are America -- there must be principle behind the decision to engage in one. For months I listened carefully to the Bush administration's arguments -- but heard no logical justification for attacking Iraq.

<p>I hoped I was wrong, that we would discover Bush indeed had secret knowledge that would validate this horrific action. I fretted the possibility I'd have to write a humble pie column, in which I would have to concede my alarm had been unwarranted.

<p>Instead, the opposite has occurred. With each passing week, it becomes increasingly clear no case for war ever existed.

<p>Yet many Americans seem unfazed by this. Half of us still believe he's doing a good job, as if lying about war is pardonable.

<p>I'm bewildered by the ends-justify-the-means rationalizing I hear -- ''At least we got rid of Saddam.'' ''At least we're giving the Iraqis a chance at democracy.'' ``At least now we can put pressure on Iran and Syria.''

<p>These effects of projected force were never seriously in doubt, just as there was no doubt Caesar would plunder the riches of Cleopatra's Egypt once he overran it. Inventorying the spoils of victory has nothing to do with assessing the propriety of initiating war in the first place.

<p>Being the bully

<p>My America, which once strove to lead, now bullies instead. It's fun to be the bully -- for a while. Others cower in fear and awe -- for a while. Your domination reaps adulation and fealty -- for a while. And your fans, drunk with the afterglow of triumph, are more than willing to overlook your unseemly tactics.

<p>Maybe this is why Bush's poll figures remain strong.

<p>But bullies never prevail because force has weaknesses, and the bullied search relentlessly to find them. Leadership based on principle, by contrast, inspires lasting unity and strength.

<p>America beat up Iraq for no good reason, destroying our honor in the process.

<p>For me, this season, all other issues pale in comparison.<p ALIGN="CENTER">Copyright 1996-2003 Knight Ridder
