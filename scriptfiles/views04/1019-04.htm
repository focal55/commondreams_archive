      <p>It is shocking: The Bush administration is suppressing a CIA report on 
        9/11 until after the election, and this one names names. Although the 
        report by the inspector general's office of the CIA was completed in June, 
        it has not been made available to the congressional intelligence committees 
        that mandated the study almost two years ago.
      <p> "It is infuriating that a report which shows that high-level people 
        were not doing their jobs in a satisfactory manner before 9/11 is being 
        suppressed," an intelligence official who has read the report told me, 
        adding that "the report is potentially very embarrassing for the administration, 
        because it makes it look like they weren't interested in terrorism before 
        9/11, or in holding people in the government responsible afterward."
      <p> When I asked about the report, Rep. Jane Harman (D-Venice), ranking 
        Democratic member of the House Intelligence Committee, said she and committee 
        Chairman Peter Hoekstra (R-Mich.) sent a letter 14 days ago asking for 
        it to be delivered. "We believe that the CIA has been told not to distribute 
        the report," she said. "We are very concerned."
      <p> According to the intelligence official, who spoke to me on condition 
        of anonymity, release of the report, which represents an exhaustive 17-month 
        investigation by an 11-member team within the agency, has been "stalled." 
        First by acting CIA Director John McLaughlin and now by Porter J. Goss, 
        the former Republican House member (and chairman of the Intelligence Committee) 
        who recently was appointed CIA chief by President Bush.
      <p> The official stressed that the report was more blunt and more specific 
        than the earlier bipartisan reports produced by the Bush-appointed Sept. 
        11 commission and Congress.
      <p> "What all the other reports on 9/11 did not do is point the finger at 
        individuals, and give the how and what of their responsibility. This report 
        does that," said the intelligence official. "The report found very senior-level 
        officials responsible."
      <p> By law, the only legitimate reason the CIA director has for holding 
        back such a report is national security. Yet neither Goss nor McLaughlin 
        has invoked national security as an explanation for not delivering the 
        report to Congress.
      <p> "It surely does not involve issues of national security," said the intelligence 
        official.
      <p> "The agency directorate is basically sitting on the report until after 
        the election," the official continued. "No previous director of CIA has 
        ever tried to stop the inspector general from releasing a report to the 
        Congress, in this case a report requested by Congress."
      <p> None of this should surprise us given the Bush administration's great 
        determination since 9/11 to resist any serious investigation into how 
        the security of this nation was so easily breached. In Bush's much ballyhooed 
        war on terror, ignorance has been bliss.
      <p> The president fought against the creation of the Sept. 11 commission, 
        for example, agreeing only after enormous political pressure was applied 
        by a grass-roots movement led by the families of those slain.
      <p> And then Bush refused to testify to the commission under oath, or on 
        the record. Instead he deigned only to chat with the commission members, 
        with Vice President Dick Cheney present, in a White House meeting in which 
        commission members were not allowed to take notes. All in all, strange 
        behavior for a man who seeks reelection to the top office in the land 
        based on his handling of the so-called war on terror.
      <p> In September, the New York Times reported that several family members 
        met with Goss privately to demand the release of the CIA inspector general's 
        report. "Three thousand people were killed on 9/11, and no one has been 
        held accountable," 9/11 widow Kristen Breitweiser told the paper.
      <p> The failure to furnish the report to Congress, said Harman, "fuels the 
        perception that no one is being held accountable. It is unacceptable that 
        we don't have &#91;the report&#93;; it not only disrespects Congress but 
        it disrespects the American people."
      <p> The stonewalling by the Bush administration and the failure of Congress 
        to gain release of the report have, said the intelligence source, "led 
        the management of the CIA to believe it can engage in a cover-up with 
        impunity. Unless the public demands an accounting, the administration 
        and CIA's leadership will have won and the nation will have lost."</p>
