<p>Over the years I have witnessed the strategic misuse of the Martin Luther King Jr. legacy as an antiseptic against the infection of bigotry and hatred.

<P>How many times have we heard proponents for dismantling affirmative action proclaim that Dr. King wanted a country where one "would not judged by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character?"

<P>The theory being, one need only quote King to be on the side of right. But the mischaracterization of King took a very ugly turn in Atlanta this past weekend.

<P>Invoking the memory of the slain civil rights martyr, the Bishop Eddie Long and King's youngest daughter, the Reverend Bernice King, led thousands of predominately African American Christians in a march supporting a constitutional ban on same-sex marriage.

<P>Bishop Long, who pastors one of the largest churches in the Atlanta area, told his supporters that it was time for the black community to be heard.

<P>"We can't be silenced," Long said to cheers in a parking lot outside of Turner Field. "We are not marching against folks," he said. "We are marching for folks."

<P>Long stated that the march also seeks to promote education reform, affordable health care and programs that create wealth for minorities. These are all worthy causes -- but it was the ban same-sex marriage that got folks out marching in near freezing weather.

<P>It is interesting to note that none of Dr. King's closest associates could envision him supporting this effort. "My own relations with Dr. King would leave me to believe that he would come down on the side of inclusion instead of exclusion," said Dr. Joseph Lowery, former head of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and a close King ally.

<P>"If Dr. King were here today, he wouldn't participate in this march," said U.S. Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.), a veteran of the civil rights movement who marched alongside King and was one of the featured speakers during the famed March on Washington. King's widow, Coretta Scott King, has called gay marriage a civil rights issue and denounced proposed amendments to ban it.

<P>Have we reduced the one who gave his life to be the moral conscience of the nation into a symbol for hate?

<P>It is disheartening to hear Dr. King's youngest daughter opine: "I know deep down in my sanctified soul that he (Dr. King) did not take a bullet for same-sex unions."

<P>Perhaps not literally, but King did give his life for America to live out what Thomas Jefferson so eloquently wrote: "We hold these truths to be self evident: that all men are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness."

<P>This Jeffersonian ideal, though it initially did not include anyone who was not white, male, or a landowner, has served as the nation's ongoing tension. How do we make this utopian belief real for those not originally intended?

<L>Are we as a nation going to continue to use the tax dollars of gay, lesbian, and transgender brothers and sisters to support the financing of services that are reserved exclusively for heterosexuals? Does this not ring with the sound of taxation without representation?

<P>Not only are the tax dollars of gays and lesbians being used for government services that they are denied, but they must spend additional thousands to have an attorney secure the benefits that are granted to heterosexual couples by virtue of the state recognizing their union.

<P>I find no evidence in my extensive reading of King that leads me to conclude that he would support such divisiveness.

<P>What I did find in King's "Letter from Birmingham Jail" is the following: "So the question is not whether we will be extremists, but what kind of extremists will we be. Will we be extremists for hate or for love? Will we be extremist for the preservation of injustice or for the extension of justice?"

<P>Sadly, Bishop Long and Reverend King have answered the question. Perhaps not in a manner that Martin Luther King Jr. could have imagined.
