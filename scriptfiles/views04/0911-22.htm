<P>A thousand voices stilled, a thousand families torn as the Persian Gulf War II reached another tragic milestone -- 1,000 American deaths.
<P>These deaths will forever remain linked to attacks on the World Trade Center and The Pentagon that occurred three years ago today. But was there really a link between al-Qaida terrorists and Saddam Hussein? Were we deliberately or unwittingly misled about weapons of mass destruction in Iraq?
<P>I don't know. All I can say is that the death toll has rung out now more than 1,000 times as Americans have fought and died in Iraq and Afghanistan.
<P>Saddam is locked up in a cage awaiting trial. We hear Osama bin Laden's days are numbered. Is that this election year's October surprise? Have we held him captive in the Kabul Hilton, feeding him room service food for three years until marching him out in handcuffs to sway an election?
<P>After the horror of that bright September day and the mystifying events that followed, it's difficult not to become jaded.
<P>As we wept, filmmakers of every ilk paid their rent by producing documentaries about that tragic day -- from Michael Moore to others whose work will be displayed on the television tonight.
<P>Songwriters -- from Toby Keith to Darryl Worley to Alan Jackson -- penned tunes that manipulated our emotions and fattened their wallets.
<P>As we tried to gather ourselves and rebuild our spirit, the airline industry soaked us for millions upon millions of dollars, blaming the attacks for their financial losses instead of admitting their own fiscal ineptitude.
<P>So far, we've dumped $200 billion into this war on terror. We've lost more than 1,000 American lives. On the other hand, we have sold a lot of flags.
<P>But wait, there's more, as the guy who sells the slicer-dicer food processor on television infomercials tells me as I wrestle with the late-night ghosts of those who died in my name and yours.
<P>Conservative estimates of Iraqi dead -- military and civilian -- are placed at about 15,000. These are only estimates, however, since the Department of Defense refuses to give an accurate accounting of how many Iraqis have been sent to their graves by coalition troops. Still, it's evidence that we've become much more efficient than in Vietnam, where we only managed about an 8-to-1 body-count ratio.
<P>Yeah, we all wanted revenge the morning of Sept. 11, 2001. We wanted to hunt down the barbarians who rocked our world, killed innocent civilians and threatened our collective psyche. But are we finding them in Iraq? Most importantly, five minutes after the last American soldier leaves that country, will the regime set up by the United States remain dedicated to the aims of the democracy we insisted they adopt?
<P>How do we get out of those killing fields?
<P>When will we know when it's truly over, as the old war song goes, over there?
