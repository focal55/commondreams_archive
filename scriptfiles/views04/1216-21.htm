<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p>First the<i> L.A. Times</i> helped kill off Gary 
  Webb’s career. Then, eight years later, after Webb committed suicide this past 
  weekend, the <I>Times</I> decided to give his corpse another kick or two, in 
  a scandalous, self-serving and ultimately shameful obituary. It was the culmination 
  of the long, inglorious saga of a major newspaper dropping the ball journalistically, 
  and then extracting relentless revenge on an out-of-town reporter who embarrassed 
  it.</P><P ALIGN="LEFT"> Webb was the 49-year-old former Pulitzer-winning reporter who 
  in 1996, while working for the <I>San Jose Mercury News</I>, touched off a national 
  debate with a three-part series that linked the CIA-sponsored Nicaraguan Contras 
  to a crack-dealing epidemic in Los Angeles and other American cities.</P><P ALIGN="LEFT"> A cold panic set in at the <I>L.A. Times</I> when Webb’s so-called 
  Dark Alliance story first appeared. Just two years before, the <I>Times</I> 
  had published a long takeout on local crack dealer Rickey Ross and no mention 
  was made of his possible link to and financing by CIA-backed Contras. Now the 
  <I>Times</I> feared it was being scooped in its own backyard by a second-tier 
  Bay Area paper.</P><P ALIGN="LEFT"> The <I>Times</I> mustered an army of 25 reporters, led by Doyle 
  McManus, to take down Webb’s reporting. It was, apparently, more important to 
  the <I>Times</I> to defend its own inadequate reporting on the CIA-drug connection 
  than it was to advance Webb’s important work (a charge consistently denied by 
  the <I>Times</I>). <I>The New York Times</I> and the <I>Washington Post</I> 
  also joined in on the public lynching of Webb. Webb’s own editor, Jerry Ceppos, 
  also helped do him in, with a public mea culpa backing away from his own paper’s 
  stories.</P><P ALIGN="LEFT">Webb was further undermined by some of his own most fervent supporters. 
  With the help of demagogues like Congresswoman Maxine Waters, a conspiracy-theory 
  hysteria was whipped up that used Webb’s series as "proof" that the 
  CIA was more or less single-handedly responsible for South-Central’s crack plague 
  — a gross distortion of Webb’s work.</P><P ALIGN="LEFT">But that conspiracy theory played perfectly into the hands of 
  the <I>L.A. Times</I>. When its own three-day series appeared a few months later 
  — attempting to demolish Webb — the <I>Times</I> disproved a number of points 
  that were never made by Webb, primarily that the CIA consciously engaged in 
  a program to spread the use of crack.</P><P ALIGN="LEFT"> The <I>Times</I>’ Washington-based reporter McManus, who spent 
  most of the late ’80s and early ’90s as one of the less-curious fourth-estate 
  stenographers to the Reagan/Bush administrations, relied principally on CIA 
  sources to vindicate the CIA in the anti-Webb series. Citing a "former 
  CIA official" named Vince Cannistraro, McManus wrote that "CIA officials 
  insist they knew nothing" about the Contra-drug dealers named by Webb. 
  Cannistraro, however, was more fit to be a subject of the <I>Times</I>’ investigation 
  than a source. Over the length of the <I>Times</I>’ series it was never mentioned 
  that Cannistraro had actually been in charge of the CIA-Contra operation in 
  the early 1980s, that is, before moving on to help supervise the covert program 
  of CIA-backed Islamic guerrillas in Afghanistan (who themselves were, and continue 
  to be, knee-deep in the heroin trade).</P><P ALIGN="LEFT"> Which brings us back to this week’s obit written by Nita Lelyveld 
  and Steve Hymon. The lead and body of the obit focus on the discrediting of 
  Webb by the <I>L.A. Times</I> and fail to mention his Pulitzer until a dozen 
  paragraphs down in the story.</P><P ALIGN="LEFT">Long before we learn of Webb’s Pulitzer, won in 1990 for reporting 
  on the Loma Prieta earthquake, Lelyveld and Hymon obediently recite their own 
  paper’s indictment of Webb’s exposé on the CIA-drug connection. They 
  quote the 1996 McManus slam on Webb, saying, ". . . the available evidence, 
  based on an extensive review of court documents and more than 100 interviews 
  in San Francisco, Los Angeles, Washington and Managua, fails to support any 
  of [Webb’s] allegations."</P><P ALIGN="LEFT">It’s an astounding and nasty little piece of postmortem butchery 
  on Webb (which never mentions that after his series appeared, Webb was voted 
  the 1996 Journalist of the Year by the Northern California Society of Professional 
  Journalists). Absolutely missing from Webb’s obit is that it was his series 
  that directly forced both the CIA and the Justice Department to conduct internal 
  investigations into the scope of any links between the Agency and drug dealers.</P><P ALIGN="LEFT">Worse, the results of those investigations proved that the core 
  of what Webb alleged was, indeed, true and accurate. When CIA Inspector General 
  Frederick Hitz presented the findings of his internal investigation to Congress 
  in 1998 (two years after Webb’s piece and the ensuing <I>Times</I> vindication 
  of the CIA), he revealed for the first time an eye-popping agreement that the 
  CIA had cemented with the Justice Department: Between 1982 and 1995, the CIA 
  was exempted from informing the DOJ if its non-employee agents, paid or unpaid, 
  were dealing drugs. In short, it was the policy of the U.S. government to turn 
  a blind eye to such connections.</P><P ALIGN="LEFT">The same report by the CIA inspector general, by the way, admitted 
  what we all knew in any case — that those connections did, in fact, exist.</P><P ALIGN="LEFT">And here’s the low point in this tale: After the CIA inspector 
  general made public the second part of his investigation — the one sparked by 
  Webb — which admitted to some links between the agency and Central American 
  drug dealers, the <I>L.A. Times</I> chose not to publish a single story about 
  the report. (No surprise here. Back in 1989, when a panel led by Senator John 
  Kerry found similar CIA–drug-running links, the <I>Times</I> showed equal disinterest.)</P><P ALIGN="LEFT"> In short, when it came to the Gary Webb series and its allegations, 
  the <I>L.A. Times</I> wound up being more protective of the CIA than the CIA 
  itself.</P><P ALIGN="LEFT"> None of this explains why, in Webb’s obit, Lelyveld and Hymon 
  omit the on-the-record admissions by the CIA of its involvement with drug-connected 
  Contras, an admission owed directly to Webb’s work. Maybe, you say, the <I>Times</I> 
  reporters are lazy and just didn’t look beyond their own paper’s archives. And 
  because the <I>Times</I> didn’t cover those admissions, Lelyveld and Hymon remain 
  (eight years after the fact) in the dark.</P><P ALIGN="LEFT"> No. I fear the answer is worse than that. One of the <I>Times</I> 
  reporters who wrote the obit, we now learn, called veteran reporter Bob Parry 
  the other day for comment on Webb’s death. Back in 1985, Parry and his partner 
  Bob Barger — working for the AP — were the first to break the story of CIA involvement 
  with drug-linked Contras. Says Parry: "The <I>Times</I> reporter who called 
  to interview me ignored my comments about the debt the nation owed Webb and 
  the importance of the CIA’s inspector-general findings. Instead of using Webb’s 
  death as an opportunity to finally get the story straight, the <I>Times</I> 
  acted as if there never had been an official investigation confirming many of 
  Webb’s allegations."</P><P ALIGN="LEFT"></P><P ALIGN="LEFT">Gary Webb’s work deserved to be<B> </b>taken seriously and to 
  be closely scrutinized precisely because of the scope of his allegations. As 
  more-objective critics than the <I>Times</I> have pointed out, Webb overstated 
  some of his conclusions, he too loosely framed some of his theses, and perhaps 
  (perhaps) overestimated the actual amount of drug funding that fueled the Contra 
  war. And for that he deserved to be criticized.</P><P ALIGN="LEFT">The core of his work, however, still stands. When much of the 
  rest of the media went to sleep, Gary Webb dug and scratched and courageously 
  took on the most powerful and arrogant and unaccountable agencies of the U.S. 
  government. His tenacious reporting forced those same agencies to investigate 
  themselves and to admit publicly — albeit in watered-down terms — what he had 
  alleged.</P><P ALIGN="LEFT">Webb’s reward was to be drummed out of the profession. After his 
  editors cowardly recanted his stories (which they had vetted), he was demoted 
  to a suburban bureau. After a year, Webb quit and wrote up his findings into 
  a book. The book was mostly ignored by the press. Webb took up a job as an investigator 
  for the California Legislature and helped spit-roast one Gray Davis. Last year, 
  Webb lost that job and yearned, unsuccessfully for the most part, to get back 
  into journalism. From a conservative Southern California military family, Webb 
  was driven not by an ideological agenda but rather by a sense of fairness and 
  justice. He was found last Friday in his Northern California home after he shot 
  himself to death.</P><P ALIGN="LEFT">Recently, Webb was interviewed for a book profiling 18 journalists 
  who found themselves discredited or censored. Let his own words be a more fitting 
  epitaph than the hack-job <I>L.A. Times</I> obituary:</P><P ALIGN="LEFT">"If we had met five years ago, you wouldn’t have found a 
  more staunch defender of the newspaper industry than me . . . I was winning 
  awards, getting raises, lecturing college classes, appearing on TV shows, and 
  judging journalism contests . . .</P><P ALIGN="LEFT">"And then I wrote some stories that made me realize how sadly 
  misplaced my bliss had been. The reason I’d enjoyed such smooth sailing for 
  so long hadn’t been, as I’d assumed, because I was careful and diligent and 
  good at my job . . . The truth was that, in all those years, I hadn’t written 
  anything important enough to suppress."<p align="CENTER">&copy; 2004 LA Weekly</P><p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable --></font></td></tr>
