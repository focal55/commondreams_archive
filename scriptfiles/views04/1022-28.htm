There was a time during the Vietnam War when military men thought nothing could stand against American firepower. I have in my yellowing notes from that time a conversation with General William Westmoreland in which he assured me that there was absolutely zero chance that the enemy could prevail against such a well-equipped army as his.

<p>Recently, Brigadier General John Defreitas, who serves as deputy chief of staff for intelligence in Baghdad, told The Boston Globe: "There is no way the insurgents can stand the power that we bring to the table. They will be defeated."

<p>There are perhaps more dissimilarities between Vietnam and Iraq than there are similarities, but it does seem that once again, led by "the best and the brightest," bewitched by American power, this country has been swept by hubris into yet another catastrophic quagmire with no end in sight.

<p>Forty years ago Time magazine ran a story under the headline "Toward the Showdown," saying that 10 months before, Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara was talking of bringing most American troops home from Vietnam by the end of 1965. "Now there is no more talk of being out by 1965 -- or any other year in the foreseeable future," said Time. "Of McNamara's statement, one administration colleague confessed last week: `We hope it's forgotten.' "

<p>Many years later McNamara would write a book saying that we went into Vietnam ignorant of its history and culture and that it had all been a mistake. Like McNamara, Donald Rumsfeld went into Iraq knowing nothing of the place, and like McNamara, he refused to listen to those who could tell him. Also like McNamara, Rumsfeld spoke of bringing the troops home early soon after Baghdad fell, but now we know they won't be out in the foreseeable future.

<p>"Pundits these days are quick to compare the fighting in Iraq with the American loss in Vietnam 30 years ago," The Weekly Standard recently scolded. The better example, the article claimed, was Guadalcanal in World War II -- "a long, hard slog" for US Marines, "but one campaign of many in a global war."

<p>"Totalitarian enemies have to be bludgeoned into submission, and the populations that support them have to be convinced they can't win," according to the article, written by Lieutenant Colonel Powel Smith, currently serving in Baghdad.

<p>That may have been true in wars against industrial states such as Japan and Germany, but when occupying powers fight insurgents on their native soil, simply bludgeoning them may not be the answer, as the Israeli experience has shown. In the end there are too many Muslims even for the United States to bludgeon.

<p>If Iraq is not Vietnam, it is even less Guadacanal. Perhaps, then, it is enough to say, when looking for historical analogies, that Iraq is simply Iraq, a country in which the last Western occupiers suffered thousands of casualties in endless engagements that never really pacified the place.

<p>Like Americans today, the British in 1917 entered Baghdad announcing their good intentions. "Our armies do not come into your cities and lands as conquerors or enemies but as liberators," said General F. S. Maude, commander of British forces. Eighty-six years later, Donald Rumsfeld would say in Baghdad that America had come "not to conquer, not to occupy, but to liberate."

<p>And, as it is today, there was deep foreboding about what the occupying power had gotten itself into. "The people of England have been led in Mesopotamia into a trap from which it will be difficult to escape with dignity and honor," wrote T. E. Lawrence (of Arabia) in a letter to the Sunday Times in 1920.

<p>The last word in this historical analogy I will leave to Winston Churchill, who said of his country's occupation of Iraq: "We are paying 8 millions a year for the privilege of living on an ungrateful volcano, out of which we are in no circumstances to get anything worth having."
