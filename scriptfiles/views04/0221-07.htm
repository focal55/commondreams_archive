<p>Little old ladies, young dads with their twin daughters in snugglies, 
punkie 20-somethings with nose rings, elegant white haired men in 
tuxedos, frumpy people, hip 30-somethings, men with receding hairlines 
and middle-aged paunch, dotcommers and construction workers, people in 
work clothes, people in tourist clothes, women in gowns, women in 
suits, interracial couples, couples with parents listening on cell 
phones...they are all there.  

<p>The electricity emanating from San Francisco is palpable, even here in 
Alabama, and the images of joyful people lined up around the block to 
wait all day are enough to make even bigots cry.  Love and justice have 
been unleashed and they are sweeping the city and the nation and they 
can't be stopped now.  It is nothing short of a Pentecost.  Maybe it 
can be slowed or halted in the short run, but thousands of couples with 
legal marriage certificates can't all be put down.  They will go back 
to their workplaces and cities and states and demand their rights as 
married couples.  Some will have the courage to press the issue.  Some 
will win.  Eventually, state by state, justice will reign.  When the 
National Guard forces the governor of Alabama to step aside from the 
courthouse door, the last battle will have been won.  

<p>Then, and only then, will MY marriage (which happens to be the 
privileged "one man, one woman" kind) be sanctified through the 
elimination of the exclusionary and discriminatory practices that mar 
the institution.  And when my as yet unconceived but hoped for child is 
doing a high school civics project s/he will ask, "Do you remember back 
when gay couples weren't allowed to get married?  WHY??  It makes no 
sense!  Didn't people know that it was wrong to try to stop people from 
loving each other?"  And I will want to critique the church, or explain 
the connections between patriarchy and heterosexism, or discuss the 
history of oppression supported by the politicians of the time…but in 
that moment I will lean down to kiss that appalled teenage face and 
say, "I am so glad that YOU know."
