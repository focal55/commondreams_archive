less than a week before the election, President George W. Bush is seeking to turn 
the favorable ratings he receives for his prosecution of the war on terrorism 
into a clinching advantage. "In a free and open society, it is impossible to protect 
against every threat," he told a New Jersey crowd. "The best way to prevent attacks 
is to stay on the offense against the enemy overseas."
<p>Of 
course, Bush is correct: A central part of America's strategy must be to pre-empt 
terrorists. But not all offensive strategies are equal, and Bush errs by arguing 
that the one being employed is doing the job. One need only listen to the terrorists 
to understand that we face grave problems. 
<p>To 
get a sense of the jihadist movement's state of mind, we must listen to its communications, 
and not just the operational "chatter" collected by the intelligence community. 
Today, the central forum for the terrorists' discourse is the Internet, where 
Islamist Web sites and chat rooms are filled with discussions of strategy and 
elaborations of jihadist ideology.
<p>Yes, assessing 
this material requires a critical eye since there is plenty of bluster and some 
chat room participants may be teenagers in American suburbs rather than fighters 
in the field. Some things, however, are clear: Radicals who were downcast and 
perplexed in 2002 about the rapid defeat of the Taliban in Afghanistan now feel 
exuberant about the global situation and, above all, the events in Iraq.
<p>For 
example, an article in the most recent issue of Al Qaeda's Voice of Jihad - an 
online magazine that comes out every two weeks - makes the case that the United 
States has a greater strategic mess on its hands in Afghanistan and Iraq than 
the Soviet Union did in Afghanistan in the 1980s. As translated by the SITE Institute, 
a nonprofit group that monitors terrorists, the author describes how the United 
States has stumbled badly by getting itself mired in two guerrilla wars at once. 

<p>Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the Jordanian terrorist 
now wreaking havoc in Iraq, sees things in a similar way. "There is no doubt that 
the Americans' losses are very heavy because they are deployed across a wide area 
and among the people and because it is easy to procure weapons," he wrote in a 
recent communiqu&#233; posted on several radical Web sites. "All of which makes 
them easy and mouthwatering targets for the believers."
<p>Clearly, 
Bush's oft-repeated claim that American efforts are paying off because "more than 
three-quarters of Al Qaeda's key members and associates have been killed, captured 
or detained" - a questionable claim in itself - means little to jihadists. What 
matters to them that the invasion of Iraq paved the way for the emergence of a 
movement of radical Sunni Iraqis who share much of the Qaeda ideology.
<p>Among 
the recurrent motifs on the Web are that America has blundered in Iraq the same 
way the Soviet Union did in the 1980s in Afghanistan, and that it will soon be 
leaving in defeat. "We believe these infidels have lost their minds," was the 
analysis on a site called Jamaat ud-Daawa, which is run out of Pakistan. "They 
keep on repeating the same mistake."
<p>For 
the radicals, the fighting has become a large part of a broader religious revival 
and political revolution. Their discussions celebrate America's occupation of 
Iraq as an opportunity to expose the superpower's "real nature" as an enemy of 
Islam that seeks to steal the Arab oil patrimony. 
<p>Moreover, 
the radicals see themselves as gaining ground in their effort to convince other 
Muslims around the world that jihad is a religiously required military obligation. 
And the American presence in the region is making the case for fulfilling this 
obligation all the more powerful.
<p>Iraq, in 
fact, has become a theater of inspiration for this drama of faith, in which the 
jihadists believe they can win by seizing cities and towns, killing American troops 
and destabilizing the country with attacks on the police, oil pipelines and reconstruction 
projects. Although coalition forces have retaken Samarra and pounded Falluja, 
they have ceded control of much of western Iraq. Taliban-like councils are emerging 
in places under the control of extremists, some linked with Zarqawi's organization.
<p>Radicals 
in dozens of countries are increasingly seizing on events in Iraq. Some Web sites 
have moved beyond describing the action there to depicting it in the most grisly 
way: images of Western hostages begging for their lives and being beheaded.
<p>These 
sites have become enormously popular throughout the Muslim world, thrilling those 
who sympathize with the Iraqi insurgents as they see jihad in action. Fired up 
by such cyberspectacles, militants everywhere are more and more seeing Iraq as 
the first glorious stage in a long campaign against the West and the "apostate" 
rulers of the Muslim world.
<p>It 
seems clear that, while the Bush administration insists that America is acting 
strongly, its pursuit of the war on terrorism through an invasion of Iraq has 
carried real costs for American security. 
<p>The 
worst thing Americans could do now is believe that the Bush administration's tough 
talk is in any way realistic. If they really think that the unrest abroad will 
have no impact at home - as too many thought before the Sept. 11 attacks- not 
even a vastly improved offense can help them.
