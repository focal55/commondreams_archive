you. We are coming to the close of this campaign, and I would like to take this 
moment to talk about the experience of it so far. <p>I have a house out in the 
woods of Dublin. We have had so many wonderful people from all over the country--sleeping 
on my couches and out in the forest in tents—it has been magical. Some have come 
just to cook and clean, and others to do good research to help me understand the 
issues facing a U.S. Senator. I have had students and Pentagon consultants, violinists 
and young chicken farmers. Such a celebration of love it has been, right there 
in the shadow of old Mount Monadnock, which watches over southern New Hampshire 
and is well worn by me and all the people I have known. <p>What we are doing is 
very special. We are running a federal campaign, a campaign for the U.S. Senate, 
without a dime of special interest money from political action committees.<p> 
In my voter registration trek last year and into this year, I met many people 
who had very different definitions of “special interests.” I remember a fellow 
working in a coffee shop in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania—a shop perched on a bluff 
avove the old Bethlehem Steel Plant, now closed due to outsourcing. He said he 
was not interested in politics anymore because it was run by special interests. 
When asked what he meant by special interests, he said, “you know, Republicans 
and Democrats.” <p>So everyone has their own idea of that. For those on the left, 
special interests are the business groups and the right wing issue groups. For 
those on the right, special interests are the environmental and justice groups. 
From either side, people can hardly see a politics of individuals anymore, just 
of groups with agendas. <p>So how do you break through that mistrust and alienation 
and despair? In my campaign, we have said that we'll take not one dime from any 
special interest group, left, right or middle, and we haven't. It has been hard 
to return checks to donors, especially on days when we could not afford even bumper 
stickers and yard signs. <p>But we managed, making our signs by hand sometimes. 
And this has proven to be a good thing.<p> We have reinvented the Burma Shave 
highway sign—the series of rhyming signs; For example: Her campaign cash / Is 
Fatcat-free / She’ll represent / Just you and me / Granny D for U.S. Senate. These 
have been a great deal of fun to think up and make, and we have a couple of barns 
and basements turned into little factories, with scrap wood going in one door 
and little signs coming out the other.<p> But we could do much more if everyone 
who liked the idea of cutting the strings of obligation to special interests would 
contribute on the website or drop by a little check. That is exactly what must 
happen if someone is to take this idea the next step forward, for it is a fundamental 
reform much more important that the McCain-Feingold bill that I walked across 
the nation to promote.<p> Making our own signs and running a shoestring campaign 
is enjoyable, but it is clear that the mainstream press is not interested in talking 
about my opponent's really outrageous voting record in the U.S. Senate, so ads 
are simply necessary to tell it like it is. <p>But we won't have much for that, 
and that is because we are new at this. Our campaign will get a ways up the mountain, 
toward the goal of a special interest-free democracy, but we will have to be a 
base camp for the next assault on the summit by others. It is possible that I 
will win, though highly unlikely.I certainly want as good a showing as possible, 
in order to encourage the next climbers. <p>To that end, I have asked my friends 
to set up a system where individuals can support individuals who agree to run 
for federal office without taking any special interest PAC funds. The first of 
it is already up, at <A HREF="http://www.grannyd.com" TARGET="_new">GrannyD.com</A> 
It will not be like <A HREF="http://www.moveon.org" TARGET="_new">MoveOn</A> or 
<A HREF="http://www.emilyslist.org/" TARGET="_new">Emily’s list</A>, but just 
a person-to-person affair, and with all parties welcome. <p>What happens this 
Tuesday, in the presidential race especially, will shape our future in such a 
significant way that we must be prepared emotinoally for it. If Mr. Kerry wins, 
there will be a relief in the progressive community that could dangerously lull 
us to sleep, when in fact there is a democracy and a world yet to save. If Mr. 
Bush wins, we may feel too depressed to take reform action. <p>So we must talk 
one step at a time, each day, to keep moving forward, regardless of the outcome. 
That’s what I will do. I will get out there and encourage good people to run, 
and to do it outside the special interest and black tie system of funding. Only 
in this way can we gain the trust of all our people, and move toward a renewal 
of democracy. And only by regaining the reins of government can we end the madness 
now underway. <p>The progressive PACs are a good thing, but it is better if people 
have a chance to give directly, so that we can avoid being labeled as tools of 
the left or the right. We need the trust of our people. <p>The progressive leaders 
can do a better job of promoting candidates who deserve support. They get so wrapped 
up in their organizations and in their fearful need to support candidates most 
likely to win, that they are fairly useless to real reform candidates. That has 
been my experience. But when they wake up, they can make a big difference in the 
repair of our democracy. <p>I am running at my age as a statement that you do 
not have to be the perfect candidate. Real people, hearing aids and all, need 
to step forward and suffer the slings and arrows of a hardball campaign. It isn’t 
so bad. <p>I debated my opponent last week, a polished, two-term U.S. Senator, 
and I was petrified. I couldn’t find half my words, and I looked pretty silly 
sometimes. But the fact that I was telling the simple truth came through, and 
79% of the viewers of the television debates, two hours after the show, were saying 
I won. So you don’t have to be the perfect candidate to connect with people who 
are very sick of the same old crud from the professional politicians. It can be 
done. <p>A small band, <A HREF="http://www.grannyd.com/audio_video.php/" TARGET="_new">Tattoo</A>, 
follows me everywhere as I walk the state of New Hampshire. My friends from my 
old study club are answering the phones. The sign shops are abuzz with activity. 
We may not make it to the top of a mountain, as our opponent has three million 
dollars to our pocket change, but we are the people, and he is not. And we are 
breaking trail up this mountian, and I hope others will take our beautiful experience 
as an invitation to follow. <p>Thank you. <p><em>Granny D (<a href="http://www.grannyd.com/" target="_new">http://www.grannyd.com/</a>)
