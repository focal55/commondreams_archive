<p>Remember "Lynxgate?"

<p>Wildlife biologists in Washington planting clumps of fur from endangered 
lynx in a national forest, sending it in for lab testing, getting caught 
trying to shut down access to a national forest by triggering the dreaded 
Endangered Species Act? Remember? About two years ago, it was everywhere. 
The media went off like an air-raid siren: Grave op-eds ran from coast to 
coast ("The great bio-fraud" --Washington Times), and conservative talk 
radio hosts had to use every adjective on the shelf for the vast left-wing 
conspiracy, then go back and order some more from overtaxed right-wing think 
tanks. Inspectors general and Congressional hearings ensued, with calls to 
reevaluate prior studies of grizzly bears and spotted owls.

<p>There was only one problem with the story: It wasn't true. Researchers had 
not planted lynx hair in a forest (and even if they had, you can't shut down 
a National Forest based on a single piece of evidence of the presence of an 
endangered species). Biologists in the national lynx study had been getting 
suspect results back from the lab, so some of them sent in control samples 
of hair from a captive lynx and a stuffed bobcat to test the lab, and told 
their supervisors they were doing so. But there was no provision for control 
samples in the protocol for the study, so the Forest Service told them to 
stop. That was that until almost a year later, in late 2001, when the Rev. 
Moon's Washington Times broke the "story," decked out as the hoax of the 
century, and the Associated Press picked it up.

<p>Lynxgate soon deflated of its own accord -- there was no "there" there, and 
the hounds were off to the next hunt -- but that doesn't matter. It remains 
firmly fixed as a reference point, like a fake star in a cyclorama, for 
pundits to indicate by quick gesture and oblique reference, eliciting a nod 
of recognition from those who heard the story when it was a big bang but 
missed its silent implosion.

<p>From that reference point, consider the latest story involving big trees and 
an endangered species. It broke last week: The Forest Service had 
green-lighted the logging of seven spotted owl habitat sites in the Sierra 
Nevada -- all old-growth forest, the Beluga caviar of the timber industry -- 
because they had been destroyed by fire. The sites could no longer support 
the owls, so it was time for "salvage logging" of the big trees, whose 
removal would otherwise be illegal. But the John Muir Project took AP 
reporters on tours of the sites and showed they were "mostly green forests," 
the opposite of destroyed. Fire damage was minor. The spotted owls were 
present and accounted for. Oops.

<p>About all the Forest Service could say was there was no "intentional attempt 
to mislead," and "things change on the ground." Maybe. Maybe not. But maybe 
the explanation of an innocent mistake isn't the first place you go, nor 
should it be the end of the story, when it's coming from an administration 
that has made "fires kill forests" into a mantra for logging big trees 
("thinning"), and the cover story for its ongoing gifts to the timber 
industry. Maybe the fact that the Bush administration issued a rule last 
January tripling allowable logging in the Sierra Nevada and striking down 
existing protections for the spotted owl and old-growth forests should be  
weighed in context by investigation-minded reporters. Maybe an 
administration that's determined to drill in the Arctic National Wildlife 
Refuge, sell off the Tongass and dynamite the Everglades for open-pit 
limestone quarries shouldn't get a free pass when one of its agencies uses 
bad data to decide that big-ticket old growth trees are defunct and have to 
be logged. Somebody went out and checked? Oh, well.

<p>In other words, there's potentially plenty of "there" here... so where have 
all the pundits gone, long time passing? Where is all the outrage from the 
fearless exposers of eco-fraud? Who even picked up the story off the AP 
wire?

<p>Google tells it: The Monterey County Herald, the Riverside Press-Enterprise, 
the Tahoe Daily Tribune, Orange County Register, Contra Costa Times, Arizona 
Daily Star, and the Santa Fe New Mexican. Also the San Francisco Chronicle 
and the Seattle Post-Intelligencer. That's pretty much it. A local story of 
regional interest. The Wall Street Journal, U.S. News and World Report, the 
Weekly Standard and 20/20's John Stossel, who were all over Lynxgate, 
apparently can't think of a thing to say this time around.
