<p>SOMETIMES YOU just gotta have Feith.

<p>Doug Feith, that is. He's the undersecretary of defense for policy and was 
long a true believer in invading Iraq.

<p>When none of the United States' intelligence agencies could find a 
significant link between Saddam and al-Qaida, Feith created a unit in the 
Pentagon, named the Counter Terrorism Evaluation Group, that helped 
manufacture one.

<p>How'd he do this? He and his cronies--who had no meaningful intelligence 
experience--took it upon themselves to draw conclusions from raw reports 
that real intelligence analysts found untenable at best, and downright kooky 
at worst.

<p>As one CIA official told The New York Times last week, Feith operated 
according to the principle, "Leave no dot unconnected."

<p>The problem with this principle, as another agency official told The Times, 
is that "if you work hard enough in this nasty world, you can link just 
about anybody to anybody else."

<p>Especially if you have Feith. See, all you have to do, brothers and sisters, 
is believe-- do you hear me, beliEEEEEve!--and you, too, can produce 
Feith-based intelligence.

<p>With the zeal of a convert, I have Feithfully compiled my own intelligence 
report on what I've concluded is a major threat to world peace.

<p>After exhaustive research, I have discovered that a certain country's 
government may have helped install Saddam's Baathist party by assisting a 
1968 coup.

<p>I also have found that this nation cultivated significant military, 
intelligence, and economic ties with Saddam in the 1980s; its current 
defense secretary traveled to Baghdad to establish closer relations with 
Saddam, even though this government knew the dictator was gassing Iranians 
on the battlefield.

<p>In fact, The New York Times has reported that this government provided 
crucial battle-planning assistance to Saddam so he could better fight the 
Iranians--and possibly use his chemical weapons more effectively against 
them.

<p>Moreover, according to the London Independent, researchers have concluded 
that some of the chemicals that Saddam used to make his deadly poisons were 
supplied by companies based in the nation in question.

<p>Although this country's government expressed a bit of squeamishness about 
Saddam's use of chemical weapons, it nevertheless refused to sever ties with 
the dictator. Indeed, even after Saddam used poison gas to kill thousands of 
Kurdish villagers, this government continued to back him (though it did 
condemn the attack).

<p>In addition, it has been well established that this country supplied Saddam 
with precursors for his biological weapons programs in the 1980s. According 
to author William Blum, these exports continued until at least November 
1989, despite the fact that everyone by then knew about Saddam's atrocities 
involving WMD.

<p>As for Osama bin Laden, well, he was partly a creation of this nation's 
intelligence agency, which helped turn him into an up-and-comer in the 
radical Muslim world. This country's government abetted bin Laden in his 
recruitment of mujaheddin fighters for the guerrilla war against the Soviets 
in Afghanistan, apparently without giving much thought to the possible 
long-term repercussions.

<p>That was an unfortunate oversight, because the multinational army of Islamic 
extremists that bin Laden created would later form part of the backbone of 
al-Qaida.

<p>The government in question has had links to other terrorists besides bin 
Laden and Saddam. It has sold arms to the regime in Iran--a noted sponsor of 
terrorism and one of the two surviving members of the Axis of Evil--then 
used profits from those sales to fund terrorist activities in Nicaragua.

<p>Some of the people involved in that scandal still serve in this country's 
government. In fact, the country's leader has recently nominated a key 
figure in the scandal to become ambassador to Iraq.

<p>If you connect all of these dots, you cannot help but be profoundly 
disturbed. But, if you follow Feith-based reasoning to its logical end, 
there's even more reason for us to be shaking in our shoes.

<p>Feith tells the Times: "The danger of Saddam's providing WMD to al-Qaida or 
another terrorist group--there you had a real problem, because his record on 
WMD was indisputable."

<p>That indeed would have been a real problem--if there had been a real 
possibility of it happening.

<p>But if it is sensible to fear that a state with a record of using WMD might 
provide those types of weapons to terrorists with which it has had contact 
over the years, then the government I have been describing must be viewed 
with grave concern. After all, it has killed a couple hundred thousand 
people with WMD, and it has a documented history of helping lunatics develop 
their own WMD programs.

<p>So, glorious defenders of the Feith, it's clear what we must do: We must 
stop this horrifying threat to global security, whose name is the United 
States of America.

<p>Whew, it's amazing what conclusions you can reach when you're guided by 
Feith.
