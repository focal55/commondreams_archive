<p> During this 4th of July weekend, why not assess the behavior of giant 
U.S. chartered multinational corporations by the yardsticks of 
patriotism to the supportive country of their birth?  These standards 
for the corporate entities themselves are important for the moral, legal 
and political persuasion necessary to improve their patriotic performance?
   <p>Let a few examples do for many.
   <p>1.  During the Vietnam War the Department of Defense learned that the 
second leading cause of hospitalization for the troops was malaria.  Fed 
up by the refusal of the profit glutted drug companies to research for 
new medicines, the Department established its own in-house, first class 
drug research division at Walter Reed Institute of Health.  Many new 
medicines to treat malaria and other tropical diseases were discovered 
and made available to the world with staggering efficiency compared to 
the private drug companies.  These drug companies continue to avoid 
investing their money in vaccines or other related medicines needed for 
Americans and natives in tropical regions.  This is the same industry 
that receives billions of dollars each year in NIH research and 
development (e.g. Taxol, AZT) and tax credits.  UNPATRIOTIC BEHAVIOR.
   <p>2.  U.S. corporations, with your taxpayer subsidies, are selling 
weapons of rapid destruction to regimes all over the world -- many of 
which are dictatorships and oligarchies oppressing their people and 
reshipping these weapons wherever they please.  Moreover, these 
corporations for years have been pressing to over-ride export controls 
and sell advanced computer technologies to countries hostile or 
potentially hostile to our country.  These arms sales range from fighter 
planes to lethal "anti-personnel" weapons thatslice into innocent 
children and adults.  UNPATRIOTIC BEHAVIOR.
  <p> 3.  Wal-Mart systematically pushes wages, standards and benefits 
downward in the U.S. -- below the level required by western countries 
where Wal-Mart is operating.  They treat American workers worse than 
Western European workers.  Moreover, they advise their low-wage workers 
how to qualify for federal welfare like food stamps.  Wal-Mart is 
demanding more and more that their U.S. suppliers meet the "China Price" 
-- meaning that they either cut their workers wages and benefits or 
close down and open up in China with its government's dictatorial 
repression of workers.  UNPATRIOTIC BEHAVIOR.
   <p>4.  U.S. multinationals export industries (e.g., auto parts) and jobs 
to oppressive regimes utilizing an assortment of tax and other 
governmental incentives and promotions.  Attempts in Congress to end 
these subsidies for fleeing America and tax havens in Bermuda, etc., 
have been defeated by corporate lobbyists and President Bush who loses 
no sleep over such callous behavior that hollows our communities and 
leaves families in desperate straits while some worry about their sons 
and daughters in the Iraq quagmire.  UNPATRIOTIC BEHAVIOR.
   <p>5.  Pentagon audits and General Accounting Office audits have 
repeatedly found Halliburton and other companies ripping off Uncle Sam 
in their contracts with the Pentagon -- even including large overcharges 
for meals for the troops.  Many more gouges and profiteering will be 
disclosed with further audits and, it is hoped, Congressional 
investigations.  UNPATRIOTIC BEHAVIOR.
   <p>6.  Chemical, nuclear power, bio-labs and other vulnerable "ports of 
call" for potential stateless terrorism have been resisting federal 
demands and certifications for upgrading security.  These firms call 
these upgrades "over-regulation."  The EPA has pointed to 100 chemical 
plants in the U.S.where the sabotage of one could cause a million 
casualties.  This resistance is broad and deep, as the Department of 
Homeland Security knows full well.  UNPATRIOTIC BEHAVIOR.
  <p> 7.  For many decades corporate polluters have been relentlessly using 
our air, water and soil as their private, toxic sewers.  Despoiling, 
poisoning and ruining the natural and inhabited land of our country has 
made large swaths of America uninhabitable due to deeply toxic 
territory.  Year after year, with lobbyists and campaign cash, oppose or 
undermine the laws, regulations and enforcement to reduce the sources of 
cancer, respiratory ailments, genetic damage and other diseases and 
property damage on innocent Americans.  UNPATRIOTIC BEHAVIOR.
   <p>Has corporate globalization ended our expectations to demand 
allegiance to the country that has bred and raised these large 
companies, subsidized these companies and has defended them abroad with 
the lives of American soldiers for over a century?
   <p>At stake is whether the constitutional sovereignty of the people can 
prevail and subordinate the imposed sovereignty of multinational 
corporations in the interests of our country and posterity.  Let the 
debate expand.
