<p>Banks and their regulators have always enjoyed a cozy relationship. 
Regulators are notorious for going slow in clamping down hard on 
practices that might be unsafe and unsound. Cease and desist orders, a 
weapon available to all the regulators, are used sparingly and usually 
only in the most egregious cases. The hundreds of billions of dollars of 
deposit insurance and taxpayer money lost in the savings and loan 
debacle of the 1980s stand as a monument to regulatory laxness and delay.

<p>One of the prime reasons for this buddy-to-buddy regulatory system is 
the fact that both the financial institutions and the regulators find it 
comfortable and mutually beneficial. Under the disjointed federal 
financial regulatory system each niche of banking has its own separate 
regulator, and when regulators appear before Congressional Committees 
they are always protective of their own group of institutions.

<p>The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) has a particular 
concern about keeping its flock of national banks in a happy mood. OCC 
derives all its operating funds from assessments on national banks under 
its jurisdiction. When a large national bank decides to switch to a 
state charter, it can leave a gaping hole in the budget of the 
Comptroller. So it is not surprising to see the Comptroller vigorously 
protect his flock of national banks through lawsuits preempting the 
application of state and local consumer protection laws to national 
banks. The unspoken and quite effective message is clear-"stick with the 
national charter and thumb your nose at state consumer laws."

<p>Now other federal financial regulators are finding some new ways to 
stroke the institutions under their jurisdiction. This time, the 
Community Reinvestment Act-so important in moving credit into low and 
moderate income and minority neighborhoods-is endangered by a new effort 
to mollify banks and thrift institutions.

<p>The Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) kicked off the new war on CRA by 
proposing a regulation which would limit full examinations of CRA 
performance to only those thrift institutions with assets of $1 billion 
or more. Institutions below that threshold would only be subject to 
limited "streamlined" and "simplified exams."

<p>It is not surprising that OTS is anxious to keep its own constituency 
happy. For several years, plans have been floated to eliminate the 
agency and let its functions be absorbed by the Office of the 
Comptroller of the Currency. In addition, some institutions have 
abandoned their thrift charters to convert to bank charters. So, OTS 
figures that easier CRA exams just might keep their wandering 
institutions home.

<p>OTS's new easy CRA exam rule takes effect on October 1. And surprise of 
surprises, the other financial agencies are now eyeing the same thought 
of easing the burdens for their member institutions. No one wants to be 
left out when it is time to pass out new gifts to the banks.

<p>The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), which examines state 
banks, has issued a proposed rule similar to the handiwork of OTS. The 
rule is now out for comment. The Comptroller of the Currency, Jerry 
Hawke, already under fire for his scorched earth attacks on consumer 
protections, is urging his fellow regulators to adopt a uniform 
streamlined CRA exam rule, undoubtedly thinking that he would have 
protection behind a solid regulatory front. But the reports coming out 
of OCC suggest that on substance, OCC will be in agreement on CRA-light 
exams for all institutions of less than $1 billion in assets. Earlier, 
the Federal Reserve was behind a move to a $500 million threshold for 
full exams, but the Fed seems certain to join the others at the billion 
dollar mark.

<p>The adoption of weaker CRA exam rules will signal to the banking 
industry a de-emphasis of efforts to push bank credit into low and 
moderate income and minority communities. It will mean a sharp reduction 
in data and analysis needed to judge how well financial institutions are 
helping to meet the credit needs of all areas of their communities.

<p>Much of the effective enforcement of CRA as a prod to push banks to 
serve all their communities comes to the fore when banks file merger 
applications. Community activists have been effective in pointing to 
data generated in CRA examinations to challenge the proposed mergers. In 
many cases, the protests constructed from the data have led to 
significant concessions that have assured critically needed credit for 
many communities. Even when the regulatory agencies want to make an 
informed decision on the community lending of the merging banks, the 
cupboard will be bare under the CRA-light approach to examinations.

<p>The proposals for bare bones exams are on top of an already absurd 
rating system applied for CRA performance by each institution. Almost 
all the financial institutions - 98 percent - receive either a 
"satisfactory" or an "outstanding" rating for their performance as 
community lenders. Nothing is so rare as a regulator applying a "need to 
improve" or a "substantial non-compliance rating to a bank. If there 
were any validity to the ratings and credit was actually flowing at a 
"satisfactory" level to all neighborhoods, our inner cities would, 
indeed, be shining cities on the hill. The conditions don't match the 
glowing CRA ratings awarded by the regulators.

<p>Until OTS leaped out with its billion-dollar rule, the only banks that 
were eligible for limited streamlined CRA examinations were small 
institutions under $250 million. But, the billion dollar threshhold lets 
the vast majority of the nation's commercial banks off the hook.

<p>There are 7,691 commercial banks nationwide -only 428 with more than $1 
billion in assets. If the OTS-generated rule becomes standard, this 
means that 7,263 banks will be on the regulators' CRA-light list.

<p>CRA has been a valuable economic tool for people who have few tools with 
which to build their communities. CRA has generated at least $1.75 
trillion in credit to inner city and depressed rural areas since its 
adoption in 1977. It should not be weakened by regulators shamelessly 
attempting to please their banker-constituency. People need to speak to 
their members of Congress about this matter.
