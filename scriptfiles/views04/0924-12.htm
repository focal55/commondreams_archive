<p>Howard Cosell once said, "Rule Number One of the 'Jockocracy' is 
that pro-athletes and politics should never mix." But in these times 
of war and resistance, a new wave of sports stars are demanding 
to be heard. In Major League Baseball, Blue Jays slugger Carlos 
Delgado has come out against the occupation of Iraq. At the 
Olympics, the Iraqi Soccer Team publicly refused to be a symbol 
for a war they opposed. In the NBA, all-star guard Steve Nash and 
forward Josh Howard have said that they were "for shooting 
jumpers not people." Now we can add NBA center/power forward 
Etan Thomas to the list of those athletic anti-war rebels who are 
rewriting the rules of the "Jockocracy".

<p>An outspoken opponent of racism and the death penalty, Thomas 
is a poet who puts his ideas to verse at rallies and panel 
discussions throughout the DC Metro area.

<p>Now, in an '<a href="http://www.edgeofsports.com" target="_new">Edge of Sports</a>' exclusive, the Washington Wizards' fifth 
year player turns his attention and anger toward George W. Bush's 
war against Iraq. This story is breaking here only because, 
according to Thomas, the Washington Times was preparing to 
profile his views until the story was killed by "higher ups" at the 
right-leaning paper.

<p>"I am totally against this war," Thomas says adamantly. "But at the 
same time, I am completely for the troops. Republicans tried to 
paint the picture that if you were against the war, you were 
somehow unpatriotic, and that couldn't be further from the truth. 
What's truly unpatriotic is misleading an entire nation into war 
under false pretenses."

<p>Thomas shakes his head at Bush and Vice President Dick 
Cheney's criticism of John Kerry's call for a more "sensitive" war in 
the Middle East. "[Bush and Cheney] missed the entire point. They 
should have been more sensitive to the 1000+ American soldiers 
that lost their lives because of the ignorance of the White House. 
They should have been more sensitive to the fact that these were 
human lives they were ruining. I wonder what they would say to the 
mothers who will never see their sons again, or the children who 
will never see their fathers again.. He has sent so many young 
children, who only signed up for the Army as a way to go to college, 
into a war that didn't need to happen. And people wonder why the 
casualties are so high.  18 year-old babies are over there losing 
their lives everyday, and he has the audacity to say that 'we are 
turning the corner.'" 

<p>Bush's arrogance has been a factor compelling the burly 
rebounder to speak out.  He sees a quagmire developing because 
of Bush's oft-criticized "go it alone" style. "He was so insistent 
about going against the U.N. and now we are bearing the burden 
alone. He said that he didn't need the help of any other country. 
Now, we need help and no other country wants to help us because 
of his unwillingness to allow the U.N. to do their job. The U.N. said 
that they didn't have enough evidence to invade Iraq, but Bush 
insisted that they had these weapons of mass destruction, and 
come to find out, that was untrue. Now we are in way over our 
heads and progress is moving at a snail's pace."

<p>Thomas also expresses frustration at the media's role in not 
questioning the drive to war. Fox News' role in particular leaves 
him both astounded and annoyed.
"It amazes me that know-it-alls like Bill O'Reilly and Sean Hannity 
can actually defend him. O'Reilly said that he was simply given 
bad info, and he thought he was doing the right thing. Well, it's his 
job to know. That excuse -- 'I didn't know any better' -- might work 
when you are seven years-old, but not when you are the President 
of the United States."

<p>As with the death penalty, Thomas is putting his feelings into 
poetry.

Below is an excerpt from Thomas' poem on the Iraq War: 


<p>
<blockquote><i>Out of the ashes of Iraq come soldiers dressed in fatigues of fire Wearing helmets secured in smoke They've choked off the lies spewed out of the mouth of a burning 
bush<br>
The true warrior's existing wake<br>
Who's flames burned them at the stake<br>
Cremated their bodies<br>
And stuffed them in an urn wrapped in red, white, and blue....<br>
Rummaging through a forest set ablaze by one lethal match<br>
With witty catch phrases forever attached to the side of their 
kingdom<br>
Operation Iraqi Freedom<br>
Links to Al Qaeda<br>
Eminent threats<br>
And weapons of mass destruction.....<br>
They've been skillfully thrown into the lion's den<br>
Out of the frying pan and into the furnace<br>
Their courage exceeds any measuring stick<br>
But they can hear the footsteps of death creeping around the 
corner<br>
For they've been led into the eye of the storm<br>
Transformed into peacekeepers<br>
Lending a helping hand for the poorly planned post-war 
strategy......</i></blockquote>
<p>Thomas knows he may feel some heat for speaking out against 
Bush's war but feels an obligation to do so. 
"I have never had a problem standing up for what I believe in. I 
admire the athletes of the past, like Bill Russell, Muhammad Ali, 
Jim Brown, John Carlos and Tommie Smith, Kareem 
[Abdul-Jabbar]. Athletes that used their position as a platform to 
speak out on social issues and stand up for a cause. Basketball 
is not my life. To quote Bill Russell, 'You're not going to reduce me 
to an entertainer. I'm a man who stands up for what I believe in 
and you're going to respect me for it.' A quote I live by is, 'I speak 
my mind because biting my tongue would make my pride bleed.'"

<p>When athletes like Etan Thomas step forward and make their 
voices heard, they do more than rewrite the rules of Cosell's 
"Jockocracy". They reclaim the humanity of all athletes normally 
presented as having muscles and tattoos but not minds. They 
also provide an outlet for the millions of people who oppose the 
priorities of this government yet embattled and embittered, feel 
they stand alone. 
When 6' 10" Etan Thomas stands up, you feel like you can 
straighten your back and walk tall by his side.
