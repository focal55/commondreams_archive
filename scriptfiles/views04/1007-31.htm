<p>Afghanistan will undergo the first presidential elections in the 
country's history on October 9, 2004. As if surprised by the fact that 
Afghans could want a voice in their country's future, George W. Bush 
touted the fact that over 10 million Afghans registered to vote as "a 
resounding endorsement for democracy." The real surprise is that, 
despite rampant anti-election violence and threats of violence, so many 
people were brave enough to register.  This certainly indicates that 
Afghans are desperate for a chance to control their own lives.  But, 
even though many will risk their lives to vote, the majority of Afghans 
played no part in decisionmaking regarding the schedule and structure of 
the elections, and will not benefit from the results.  This election 
process was imposed by the United States to solve "Afghan problems" as 
defined by the United States. In reality, the problems facing Afghans 
are the results of decisions made in Washington in the 1980s and 1990s.

<p><b>Test for Bush, Not for Afghans

</b>
<p>To the Bush administration and media pundits, presidential elections in 
Afghanistan will bring the country closer to being a "democracy," where 
people decide their own fate.   Business Week describes the elections as 
a "first test" of Bush's claim that Afghanistan and Iraq "are on the 
path to democracy."  In a Washington Post opinion piece, Andrew Reynolds 
of the University of North Carolina similarly described the elections as 
a "Test for Afghan Democracy."  In this view, any failure of the process 
will be caused by a lack of readiness of Afghanistan and its people for 
"democracy," not a failure of external players to fulfill their 
responsibilities to the country.  What is being tested is solely the 
capacity of Afghans to embrace democracy.  Few media outlets have dared 
to blame the United States for the more egregious fraud of imposing 
early elections on a still war-ravaged country where Northern Alliance 
warlords legitimized by Washington will continue to hold real power, 
regardless of who wins the vote.  If the Afghan elections fail, Afghans 
will be blamed and Afghans will continue to suffer, seemingly as a 
result of their own actions.
 
<p>Another point rarely mentioned is that elections do not equal 
democracy.  J. Alexander Thier, a former legal adviser to Afghanistan's 
Constitutional and Judicial Reform Commissions, is one of the few 
commentators who dares to utter the simple fact:  "Elections themselves 
are only a small part of democracy."  In Thier's opinion, "Effective 
government service, protection of individual rights, accountability - 
these are the true fruits of democracy.  Holding elections without the 
rule of law can undermine democracy by sparking violence, sowing 
cynicism and allowing undemocratic forces to become entrenched."  
Elections are merely "the end product of a successful democracy."  
Regardless of who wins the elections and by what means, civil society in 
Afghanistan is at the moment anything but democratic. Foreign influence, 
particularly US influence, has ensured that insecurity, warlordism, and 
a severely curtailed media are entrenched features of the political 
landscape.

<p>In reality the Afghan presidential elections will be a test not of 
"Afghan democracy," but of Bush's ability to impose his political order 
on a country. An editorial in Newsday holds that, "Historic elections in 
Afghanistan and Iraq are key goals of U.S. foreign policy, especially 
for President George W. Bush, who is campaigning on his determination 
that they be held on schedule."  Reynolds says the elections will be "a 
watershed moment, equal in importance to the post-Sept. 11 ousting of 
the Taliban."  Since the warlords that now run most of the country are 
as bad as or worse than the Taliban, the ousting of the Taliban was more 
a watershed for Washington than for the Afghan people.  Similarly, the 
Afghan elections are really a benchmark for Bush's foreign policy. 

<p>Reynolds says, "A legitimately elected administration in Kabul would not 
just be good for the Afghans; it would be much more likely to carry out 
the reforms the United States so keenly wants."  It is clear that the 
only outcome that would be considered "legitimate" by the US is a win by 
the incumbent transitional President, Hamid Karzai.  While there are 18 
candidates running, the US media have focused almost exclusively on 
Karzai, frequently dubbed "the favorite" in news reports.  For the Bush 
administration it is imperative that their hand picked and well-trained 
candidate wins.  Not only will the anticipated victory of Karzai cement 
the current order of US influence, it will signal a victory for the "war 
on terror" as Bush defines it.   Reynolds says,  "Karzai's 
victory...would shine a ray of hope on an otherwise gloomy series of 
U.S. foreign policy misadventures."

<p><b>Women are Pawns in Election</b>

<p>The Bush administration constantly calls attention to the fact that 4 
million of those who registered to vote in Afghanistan were women.  Just 
as the "liberation" of Afghan women was used to justify the bombing of 
Afghanistan three years ago, women's participation in US imposed 
election is again used to justify the US approach.  While the 
administration deals in broad statistics to paint a rosy picture, a 
closer look reveals that the Afghan political environment, controlled by 
US-backed warlords and a US-backed president, remains extremely hostile 
to women. Women comprise 60% of the population but only 43% of 
registered voters. Additionally, sharp differences in literacy between 
men and women put women at a huge disadvantage.  Only 10% of Afghan 
women can read and write.  While school attendance of girls has 
increased to about 50% nationwide, it is too early to affect women 
voters.  Furthermore, under Karzai's presidency, married women were 
banned from attending schools in late 2003.

<p>While much mileage has been squeezed out of the notion that the US 
"liberated" Afghan women, only one dollar out of every $5,000 ($112,500 
out of $650 million) of US financial aid sent to Afghanistan in 2002 was 
actually given to women's organizations. In 2003, according to Ritu 
Sharma, Executive Director of the Women's Edge Coalition, that amount 
was reduced to $90,000. At the same time, women have increasingly been 
the targets of violence. New studies by groups like Amnesty 
International reveal that sexual violence has surged since the fall of 
the Taliban, and there has been a sharp rise in incidents of women's 
self-immolation in Western Afghanistan.  Amnesty International has 
documented an escalation in the number of girls and young women abducted 
and forced into marriage, with collusion from the state (those who 
resist are often imprisoned).

<p>US policy has empowered extreme fundamentalists who have further 
extended women's oppression in a traditionally ultra-conservative 
society.  In a public opinion survey conducted in Afghanistan this July 
by the Asia Foundation, 72% of respondents said that men should advise 
women on their voting choices and 87% of all Afghans interviewed said 
women would need their husband's permission to vote.  On International 
Women's Day this year, Hamid Karzai only encouraged such attitudes.  He 
implored men to allow their wives and sisters to register to vote, 
assuring them, "later, you can control who she votes for, but please, 
let her go [to register]."  Most of the candidates running against 
Karzai have mentioned rights for women in some form or another as part 
of their campaign platforms. While this is obligatory in post-Taliban 
Afghanistan, it is little more than lip service. Latif Pedram, a 
candidate who went slightly further than others by suggesting that 
polygamy was unfair to women, was barred from the election and 
investigated by the Justice Ministry for "blasphemy".

<p>Just like the Afghan constitution signed earlier this year, which gives 
equal rights to women on paper, this election will probably have little 
bearing on the reality of Afghan women's lives.   Denied an education 
and underrepresented in voter rolls, with little control over the 
patriarchal justice system and sexist family attitudes, women are once 
more simply pawns within the US-designed Afghan political structure.


<p>Warlords: Now a Problem for Bush

<p>A recent countrywide survey of Afghans by the International Republican 
Institute found that "over 60 percent cited security as their primary 
concern, followed by reconstruction and economic development."  
According to 65% of respondents, "warlords and local commanders are the 
main sources of instability in the country."  While most women may need 
the permission of their husbands to vote, their choices will be 
extremely limited, since most Afghans are being intimidated by US backed 
warlords into voting for them. According to Brad Adams, Asia Director at 
Human Rights Watch, "Many voters in rural areas say the [warlord] 
militias have already told them how to vote, and that they're afraid of 
disobeying them." The intimidation tactics of Abdul Rashid Dostum and 
others are no secret.

<p>But the wider context of the warlords' power is rarely mentioned. As 
part of Bush's "War on Terror," the US made deals with Northern Alliance 
warlords in his crusade against the Taliban.  Warlords were appointed to 
high-level government posts and allowed to regain regional power.   As 
many factions fought one another for regional dominance, the US actively 
denied the expansion of the International Security Assistance Force from 
Kabul to the rest of the country, thereby closing a crucial window of 
opportunity to undermine the warlords early on. One should hardly be 
surprised at the current situation, a natural outcome of US policy over 
the last three years.

<p>When their actions only affected the lives of ordinary Afghans, warlords 
were not a problem for Bush. Only now is Washington beginning to hold 
some of the warlords at arms length, as their presence reflects badly on 
the carefully staged demonstration of "democracy" via elections. Even 
worse, a warlord may become president, thwarting the carefully planned 
outcome. Yunus Qanooni of the Northern Alliance is seen as a major 
challenger to Karzai.  If Karzai doesn't win, Afghanistan could spiral 
out of US control. To preserve control, or at least validate the 
propaganda that Afghanistan is a victory for the US "war on terror," the 
Bush administration is actively lobbying Karzai's opponents to not run. 
According to the Los Angeles Times, thirteen of the 18 candidates, 
including Qanooni, have complained about interference from Zalmay 
Khalilzad, the U.S. Ambassador. Khalilzad has reportedly "requested" 
candidates to withdraw from the race, attempting to bribe them with a 
position in the cabinet.  Senior staff members of several candidates 
were described as "angry over what many Afghans see as foreign 
interference that could undermine the shaky foundations of a democracy 
the U.S. promised to build."
Likely Scenarios

<p>Post election Afghanistan will look very much as it does today, if not 
worse.  If Karzai wins with the backing of some or all Northern Alliance 
factions, their leaders will be awarded high-level positions, further 
entrenching and legitimizing them. If Karzai wins without enough support 
from his opponent warlords, the losing parties may attack the central 
government, reverting the country to civil war. If Karzai loses, the 
warlords might form an alliance government, a horrible thought to 
contemplate considering the 1992-1996 "coalition government" of many of 
the same factions. In the latter two scenarios, it is not clear whether 
the US would intervene and re-install Karzai as President (as it has 
done in Iraq with Prime Minister Iyad Allawi), or allow Afghanistan to 
fester and implode (as it did in the early 1990s). What is certain is 
that none of these scenarios will lead to peace or real democracy.
