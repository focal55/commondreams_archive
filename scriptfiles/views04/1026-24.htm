redeployment of British forces in Iraq to support a US assault on Falluja marks 
another stage in a creeping return to the colonial era, when popular revolts against 
occupation were routinely suppressed by overwhelming force. These past episodes, 
revealed in declassified British government files, provide numerous parallels 
with Iraq, and suggest a pattern of future blunders and atrocities. Those in Britain 
who like to regard more recent military interventions as humanitarian might dwell 
on those parallels as the latest phase of the Iraq war unfolds. </FONT><P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">British 
ministers' claim to be defending civilisation against barbarity in Iraq finds 
a powerful echo in 1950s Kenya, when Britain sought to smash an uprising against 
colonial rule. Yet, while the British media and political class expressed horror 
at the tactics of the Mau Mau, the worst abuses were committed by the occupiers. 
The colonial police used methods like slicing off ears, flogging until death and 
pouring paraffin over suspects who were then set alight. </FONT><P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">British 
forces killed around 10,000 Kenyans during the Mau Mau campaign, compared with 
the 600 deaths among the colonial forces and European civilians. Some British 
battalions kept scoreboards recording kills, and gave &#163;5 rewards for the 
first sub-unit to kill an insurgent, whose hands were often chopped off to make 
fingerprinting easier. "Free fire zones" were set up, where any African could 
be shot on sight. </FONT><P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As 
opposition to British rule intensified, brutal "resettlement" operations, which 
led to the deaths of tens of thousands, forced around 90,000 into detention camps. 
In this 1950s version of Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq, forced labour and beatings 
were systematic and disease rampant. Former camp officers described "short rations, 
overwork, brutality and flogging" and "Japanese methods of torture".</FONT>

<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Guerrillas 
resisting British rule were routinely designated "terrorists", as now in Iraq. 
Britain never admitted that it was opposing a popular, nationalist rebellion in 
Kenya. Similarly, leftwing Malayan insurgents fighting British rule in the 1950s 
had strong popular support among the Chinese community but were officially called 
"terrorists". In secret, however, Foreign Office correspondence described the 
war as being fought "in defence of &#91;the&#93; rubber industry", then controlled 
by British and European companies. </FONT><P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But 
under the banner of fighting communism, British forces were given free rein in 
Malaya. Collective punishments were inflicted on villages for aiding insurgents. 
A shoot-to-kill policy was promoted, tens of thousands of people were removed 
into "new villages" and used as cheap labour, and British soldiers had themselves 
photographed holding guerrillas' decapitated heads. The idea that the revolt was 
ended through "winning hearts and minds" is a myth; it was crushed by overwhelming 
force, such as massive aerial bombing. </FONT><P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
brutality needed to be kept secret, a key theme in suppressing revolts. After 
Britain intervened to crush a rebellion in Oman in 1957, an internal Foreign Office 
minute stated that "we want to avoid the RAF killing Arabs if possible, especially 
as there will be newspaper correspondents on the spot". The British army commander 
in Oman later noted that "great pains were taken throughout the Command to keep 
all operational actions out of the press". </FONT><P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
reason for this was that Britain committed numerous war crimes in Oman, including 
the systematic bombing of civilian targets such as water supplies and farms. These 
attacks "would deter dissident villages from gathering their crops" and ensure 
"denial of water", officials stated in private. Bombing was intended to "show 
the population the power of weapons at our disposal" and to convince them that 
"resistance will be fruitless and lead only to hardship". </FONT><P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Britain 
was defending an extremely repressive regime where smoking in public, playing 
football and talking to anyone for more than 15 minutes were banned. Yet Harold 
Macmillan told President Kennedy in a 1957 telegram that "we believe that the 
sultan is a true friend to the west and is doing his best for his people". </FONT><P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As 
Blair and Bush claim to support democracy in Iraq, it is as well to remember that 
London and Washington have almost always opposed popular, democratic forces in 
the Middle East, preferring strong regimes capable of bringing "order". </FONT><P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Britain's 
stance on the US war in Vietnam offers other useful lessons. Just as Tony Blair 
poses as providing a brake on US tactics in Iraq, Harold Wilson claimed to do 
the same over Vietnam. Yet Britain secretly backed the US in every stage of military 
escalation. </FONT><P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In July 
1965, when the US doubled its ground troop numbers in Vietnam, Wilson privately 
reassured President Johnson of his support for US policies "in the interests of 
peace and stability". </FONT><P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
Wilson-Johnson correspondence highlights a shocking level of connivance between 
No 10 and the White House to deceive the public. When the US first bombed Hanoi 
and Haiphong in June 1966, Wilson issued a statement disassociating the government 
from the bombing. Yet this statement had been passed to the US for approval while 
Wilson assured Johnson that "I cannot see that there is any change in your basic 
position that I could urge on you." The myth in Iraq that Britain is not complicit 
in US brutalities has its precedent in Vietnam. Declassified files show that, 
in 1962, Britain covertly sent an SAS team to south Vietnam under "temporary civilian 
status", to help train soldiers of the dictatorial regime of President Diem. Britain 
secretly provided arms and intelligence support to the US to improve US bombing. 
</FONT><P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Moreover, brutal 
US "counter-insurgency" programmes were based on prototypes developed by British 
advisers. Britain's "Delta Plan" for the south Vietnamese regime, described by 
the Foreign Office as intended "to dominate, control and win over the population" 
in rural areas, became the US "strategic hamlets" programme, which forced millions 
of Vietnamese peasants into fortified villages that resembled concentration camps. 
</FONT><P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As in Iraq, the publicly 
proclaimed search for peace was largely a charade. A senior Foreign Office official 
wrote in 1965: "The government are fighting a continuous rearguard action to preserve 
British diplomatic support for American policy in Vietnam. They can only get away 
with this by constantly emphasising that our objective, and that of the Americans, 
is a negotiated settlement". </FONT><P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">These 
episodes highlight the gulf between what ministers have told the public and what 
they have understood to be the case in private. The declassified secret files 
point to some harsh truths about current policy in Iraq: that the war is not about 
what our leaders say it is (democracy), is not primarily against who they say 
it is (terrorists) and is not being conducted for whom they say it is (Iraqis). 
</FONT><P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Iraqis are in practice 
regarded as "unpeople" whose deaths matter little in the pursuit of western power; 
the major block on committing atrocities is the fear of being exposed and ministers 
will do all they can to cover them up. The public is the major threat to their 
strategy, which explains why they resort to public deception campaigns. If, as 
must be expected, atrocities now multiply in Iraq - with Britain complicit - we 
cannot claim we were not warned. </FONT><P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><I>Mark
