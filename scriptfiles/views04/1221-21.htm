<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->   The holidays always promise redemption and hope: and just maybe Coca-Cola will drop their “Big Tobacco” strategies in favor of the moral high-ground. When faced with damning truths, big tobacco has relied on obfuscation, bogus science and deep-pocketed PR campaigns. Coca-Cola, stung by criticism that they too are merchants of immoral marketing aimed at children and unethically denying the health risks of their sugar water is fighting back: as if manufacturing pseudo science will provide a smokescreen? 

 

  <p>   Barbara Beck, principal manager of scientific and regulatory affairs at Coca-Cola suggested that I “misinformed” readers in an article titled, “<a href="http://www.commondreams.org/views04/0720-07.htm" target="_new">Sugar Wars</a>” (first carried by the Common Dreams website.)  She forward a letter (7/21/04) to <a href="http://www.EducationNews.org" target="_new">EducationNews.org</a> (which also carried the article) complaining that the article was flawed in three areas: soft drinks do not cause obesity, soft drinks do not cause osteoporosis and finally, there is no data to link soft drink consumption to diabetes! 

 

<p> Apparently, Coca-Cola emboldened by their enormous wealth and power with a net income of $674 million and net operating revenue of over $17 billion in 2003, believes that corporate spin and relentless repetition of mistruths can bury any critics. When corporate captains feel the need to respond to the critics, they expose their capitalistic “Achilles tendon” or should we say, let’s crush anything or anyone who gets in the way of profit making. As a teacher and father of two, I am sickened by the assault on public schools by the likes of Coca-Cola and their “exclusive pouring contracts.” Just look at Coca-Cola’s own view of schools:<em> 'The school system is where you build brand loyalty.'</em> -- John Alm, president and chief operating officer, Coca-Cola Enterprises, quoted in the Atlanta Journal Constitution, April 6, 2003 

<p> I refuse to shut up and know this: it is making an impact. On page 83 of Coca- Cola’s own “Management’s Financial Review 2003,” they give us a glimpse into their real nature. <em>“Laws that restrict our ability to distribute products in schools and other venues or materially impact our cash flow could negatively impact our revenue and profit.”</em> No wonder Ms. Beck fired off her salvo across the deck of my little ship of data, she figures that the battleship “Coca-Cola” can scare away any citizen or citizens tired of their lies, manipulation of children and corporate brazenness. 

 

<p><b>Hey Coca-Cola, three swings and three misses
</b> 

<p> Examine the three premises that Ms. Beck gave above to cast doubt on my concerns about soda pop. First, there is<em> “no conclusive scientific evidence indicates that sugar in soft drinks causes obesity.”</em> A recent study in JAMA (Journal of the American Medical Association) probably the most respected medical literature in the nation refutes this falsehood.  JAMA noted that soft drinks are the leading source of added sugar in the American diet. Lead author of the report Matthias B. Schulze added this, “our finding suggest that frequent consumption of sugar-sweetened beverage may be associated with larger weight gain and increased risk of Type-2 diabetes, possibly by providing excessive calories and large amounts of rapidly absorbable sugar.” Reporting in the ‘Lancet’, a British medical journal, a team of Harvard researchers linked soda pop consumption to childhood obesity. This was an extensive 19- month investigation.

 

<p> The second premise that soda pop doesn’t cause osteoporosis is again refuted. A study done by the Harvard School of Public Health found that active girls, who drink cola type soda pop, are five times more likely to suffer bone fractures than girls who don’t consume soda pop.  Other animal studies point to consistent and definite bone loss due to soda pop and the phosphoric acid contained in them.

 

<p>   Lastly, Ms. Beck states, <em>“no data exist to connect soft drink consumption with diabetes.”</em> She simply needs to read the JAMA report that outlines the research on 91,000 female nurses from 1991-1999. All the women were free of diabetes in 1991, yet, the research showed that nurses who consumed one or more sugary drinks a day were 1.3 times more likely to develop diabetes! I see students at my school who tell me they consume between 2-4 20- ounce containers of pop a day!

 

<p>Does Coca-Cola teach “ the world to sing in perfect harmony” about diabetes/osteoporosis?

 

<p> Once Coca-Cola was another company trying to make a buck. Their first television ad was produced in conjunction with a Thanksgiving special that featured Charlie McCarthy. They quickly hooked up with Disney’s television premiere on Christmas 1950. Honing their skills, Coca-Cola produced one of television’s most successful PR hook, “I’d like to Buy the World a Coke” blitz. Now Coca-Cola has saturated the children’s market. From a Coke backpack to Coca-Cola Polar bear bedding and accessories, the key is name recognition. If our kids have Coca-Cola sheets, Coca-Cola dude bear boxer shorts, Coca-Cola checkers, Coca-Cola Yahtzee, Monopoly, Barbie and Checkers: why would they fear Coca-Cola in schools or doubt Ms. Beck’s assurances that Coca Cola is healthy? I would like parents to sing in perfect harmony, “we are going to kick Coca-Cola out of schools and make the drinking of Coca-Cola a rare treat.” 

 

<p> Like Big tobacco, Coca-Cola has the right to push their product. Like Big tobacco, Coca-Cola knows of the health risks of their product, yet, prefer silence to safeguarding children. Go to page 64 of that same prospectus mentioned above. “Our total education channel, consisting of elementary, middle and high schools, along with colleges and universities, contributed approximately 2.5% of our total volume in 2003.” Children are nothing but mere statistics on a profit sheet even our most innocent- aged kids: elementary school children. Coca-Cola’s misdeeds are not going unchallenged, just look at the action being taken worldwide: 

<p>UNISON, the UK's largest union with 1.3 million members, passed a resolution at their national conference, resolving to: "support the call to boycott Coca Cola products"

<p>NIPSA, the Northern Ireland Public Services Association, affiliated to both the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and to the British TUC, voted to support the boycott of Coca Cola until the company meets Sinaltrainal's (a union in Columbia trying to bring to light Coca-Cola’s anti-union tactics) demands.

<p>Service Employees International Union (SEIU), with 1.7 million members, passed a resolution "Support the world-wide call to boycott Coca-Cola and work to win broad AFL-CIO support for the campaign against killer Coke..."

<p>Communications Workers of America (CWA), which represents 700,000 members, passed a resolution: “that unless the lawsuit is settled by October 15 and the safety and rights of workers in the Coke's Colombian plants are protected, the CWA will support SINALTRAINAL's divestment and boycott campaign against Coca-Cola and SunTrust Bank, and will urge our members to do the same."

<p>American Postal Workers Union (APWU), with 270,000 members, passed a resolution: " that the United States Postal Service remove all Coca-Cola products from all postal facilities, and that State and Local American Postal Workers Unions, stop purchasing all Coca-Cola products until this issue is resolved."

<p>The Labor Council for Latin American Advancement (LCLAA), a constituency group of the AFL-CIO, representing the interests of 1.7 million Latino workers who are members of a union in USA passed a motion rebuking Coca-Cola for their human rights violations in Colombia.

<p>The American Federation of Teachers (AFT), with 1.3 million members, passed a resolution: " to encourage AFT locals and individual members to participate in a letter writing campaign to Coca-Cola to pressure its Colombian branch to stop its persecution of employees seeking union representation and to respect basic trade union rights..."

<p>The International Longshore and Warehouse Union, with 60,000 members, passed a resolution: "That the ILWU join the boycott of Coca-Cola and do all it can to publicize the boycott around the world." 

 

<p> Parents, make the year 2005 the year that all school vending contracts for Coca-Cola as well as Pepsi cease! If you need to serve pop in the house, make it a rare and occasional treat. Water and soy/rice milk and real juice provide a sound and better alternative. And may Coca-Cola executives wake up Christmas morning to find the gift of corporate integrity, ethical standards and moral fiber tucked neatly under their tree: because Santa and an educated public might just pass by your corporation not just Christmas day, but all year long.
