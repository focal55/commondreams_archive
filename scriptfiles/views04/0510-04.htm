<p>Each morning, I take a moment to read the latest list of American soldiers who have died in Iraq, trying to note each person's age, hometown, rank and service, and whether the soldier was Reserve or active duty. It has become a little ceremony, a small, insubstantial way to acknowledge the sacrifice that these men and women have made on behalf of our country.

<p>The information in the listing is generally scant, but occasionally some detail will catch your attention and get you to wondering about the life that had led the person to that point. The 30-year-old private first class -- probably the "old man" in his outfit -- who came to the service late in search of something. The reserve sergeant in his mid 40s, who probably has grown kids back home and may have thought that he was long past the days when he would be called to war. Sometimes, by knowing their units, you can even identify the engagement in which they were killed.

<p>That kind of ceremony has a public counterpart as well. A year after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, family members and friends gathered at the World Trade Center site, at the Pentagon, and in an empty field in Pennsylvania to read off the list of victims as a way to commemorate our loss and to reassure ourselves that they had not been forgotten. The Vietnam Memorial in Washington lists 58,000 names of those who died in that war, neither to celebrate nor denigrate their cause, but to acknowledge what they gave in our behalf.

<p>Yet suddenly, in this war, we are told that it is inappropriate, verging on disloyal, to honor the dead in such a fashion. When ABC's "Nightline" devoted a show to a reading of the names of those Americans who have died in Iraq, the decision was denounced by some as an anti-war political statement. A similar logic has driven the Bush administration to impose a media blackout of pictures of flag-draped caskets being returned home to the United States. It took a Freedom of Information Act request to allow the American people to see military photographs of the caskets, and even then the Pentagon announced that the request was granted in error. 

<p>It was a mistake to let you see that, our government said, a mistake that will not be repeated.

<p>That studied refusal to acknowledge our dead extends even to those running the war. Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz was asked by Congress recently for the latest casualty count. "It's approximately 500, of which -- I can get the exact numbers -- approximately 350 are combat deaths," he said. Perhaps I should have expected that from a man who has underestimated everything else about this war, but it still struck me as disturbing.

<p>Even in a strange time, this is strange stuff. It is an unfamiliar sort of patriotism that requires us not to mark the sacrifice that others are making in our name, that requires us to avert our national gaze when the bodies come home from war. The tradition of honoring those who have fallen is as old as war itself, and even today warriors will risk their lives to recover the bodies of their dead, so they can be celebrated appropriately.

<p>But there is, of course, a reason behind this attempted redefinition of patriotism. Our leaders fear that public support for this war is so fragile that it will crumble should we acknowledge the price we are paying. It may be that they are right. Public support is indeed falling, a fact that has led some to accuse the American people of weakness.

<p>That is not where the fault lies.

<p>In the wake of Sept. 11, no number of casualties would have dissuaded the American people from invading Afghanistan, which had lent shelter and support to Osama bin Laden and his al-Qaida organization. The cause was clear, the goal certain. We were angry and righteous in that anger.

<p>But the war against Iraq was an optional war, and some of us who opposed it did so out of fear of this very moment. It was foolhardy and irresponsible to commit our country to a war that the American people would support only if things went well, and our leaders knew the danger. That's why they tried for so long to disguise its cost and difficulty.

<p>Now we pay the consequences, and for some the price is very high.
