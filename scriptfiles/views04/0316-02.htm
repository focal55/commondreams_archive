<p>One year ago, Toni Smith was just another Division III athlete 
grinding through her senior year as Captain of the Women's 
basketball team at Manhattanville College. Yet her decision to 
protest on the court at the start of the US War vs. Iraq and turn her 
back on the American Flag during the national anthem, sparked 
debate throughout the sports and political world. Today Toni Smith 
is living in New York City, working for a young people's mentoring 
program called New York Youth at Risk (<A href="http://www.nyyouthatrisk.org" target="_new">www.nyyouthatrisk.org</A>). 
One year later Toni Smith speaks to Dave Zirin, News Editor of the 
Prince George's Post, looking back on the events of the last year.

<p><b>Dave Zirin:</b>  It's been almost a year since you took your 
demonstration to the court.  When did you first see the need to 
make a stand and why did you feel it was so important to take the 
actions that you did?

<p><b>Toni Smith:</b> I'm from a mixed racial and ethnic background. My 
mom is Jewish, and my dad is Black, white and Cherokee. I was 
learning about the prison industrial complex and the wars against 
Native Americans. It made me very angry but I never paid attention 
to how this history played out on the [basketball] court.  I never 
thought about the National Anthem because I went to alternative 
schools.  I never had to say the pledge.  I never had to stand and 
salute anything before class. On the court I would just stand and 
let the time go by.
<p>So last year I was talking with my boyfriend.  His family's very 
politically active also. They don't ever stand for the National 
Anthem, and they're very clear on their position. We were talking 
about all the policies we dislike, and he said "why do you stand for 
the anthem at your games?"  And I said, "Well I never really thought 
about it.  I'm the captain of the team, and I have to be a team 
leader and a good role model."  He said "but that has nothing to do 
with who you are.  This is not what you believe in.  You just told me 
how much you dislike this flag and what it stands for."  He's part 
Black and part Cherokee also and he said to me "This flag 
represents the slaughter of our ancestors", and I said 'you're 
absolutely right.' We had a game a few days later, and as we 
stood up to sing the National Anthem I said no.  

<p><b>DZ:</b>  When was this?

TS:</b>  This was probably the first week in December [2002]. It was at 
NYU. I thought, "No, this is not more important than my beliefs. 
This [ritual] has nothing to do with who I am." I didn't tell anyone.  I 
didn't really think of it as something that should be made public. It 
went unnoticed even by my teammates and family. Then one day 
the president of the school came up to me and said "if anyone 
gives you any trouble, send them to me." I said "alright, but it's not 
an issue."  And then he told me that there was this huge uproar 
that there were several parents of the team who were furious and 
were threatening to go to the NCAA.  

<p><b>DZ:</b>  How did the uproar then unfold?

<p><b>TS:</b>  A few of the parents went to the president of the school.  The 
next thing that happened was one of my teammates called my 
dorm room and said, "you have to look on instant messenger. You 
have to see what our team mates are writing about you." There 
was this back and forth I.M. battle saying, "I can't believe Toni's 
doing this, what kind of a team captain is she?"  All of this was 
done behind my back.  No one asked me why, no one confronted 
me about it.  The next day in the locker room I confronted the girl 
who began the I.M. discussion and that turned into an explosion 
within the team. 

<p><b>DZ:</b>  Every news story said that you were protesting the war on Iraq 
in particular. Was that in fact the case?  

<p><b>TS:</b>  Iraq was the icing on the cake.  The war took me from angry at 
the general direction of the US to "are you kidding!?!"  But it wasn't 
just the war.  It was everything before that.  It was everything that 
the flag is built on, every thing that is continuing to happen and 
things that haven't even happened yet.  

<p> <b>DZ:</b>  Why do you think your actions touched such a nerve?

<p><b>TS:</b>  The debate around the war, no question. We were playing a 
game at St. Joseph's.  Their assistant coach had just been sent 
over to serve. They were angry. Nothing really came about it at that 
game, but the next team we were scheduled to play was the 
Merchant Marine Academy.  People at St. Joseph's called and 
warned them about me.  In addition to that a news reporter got a 
hold of it. The Merchant Marine Academy was the worst team in the 
league.  They' were something like 0 and 25. They don't have any 
fans, and let me tell you, this gym was packed. You can't even 
imagine what it was like.  They had cadets lined up on the 
sidelines, each with their own flag that was about seven feet tall.  
Every single person in the stand was in uniform, with their own 
flag. They were shouting things at me - obscenities, curses, you 
name it.  It was unbelievable.  It was so bad that even the 
teammates who hated what I was doing had to put themselves in 
my place and defend my position.  It came down to "you're not 
going to disrespect my team." That news reporter captured how 
angry everyone was at that game, and at the next game the AP was 
there and the story took off.


<p><b>DZ:</b> Out of teammates, coaches, administration, school president, 
who was supportive and who wasn't?

<p><b>TS:</b>  Half of my teammates were completely against me.  
Completely against everything I was doing. There were four girls 
who were very against me and tried to make my life a living hell.  
The one who started the instant messenger drama sent a petition 
around the school, saying, "Sign this to demand that Toni Smith 
return all her financial aid, because she is disrespecting our 
school." What's the point in that?  We were teammates in the 
middle of the season, one of the best seasons our school has 
ever had, and it just didn't make any sense.  They talked to 
reporters when we were asked not to by the coach and by the 
president. When I finally decided to talk to the press it was 
because my teammates were speaking out without permission. It 
got to the point where either they're going to have lies out there or I 
speak up. 

<p><b>DZ:</b> Did any teammates back you up?

<p><b>TS:</b>  Two of my teammates always stood next to me during the 
National Anthem, one in front of me, one behind me, holding my 
hands - Melissa Solano and Dionne Walker.  They were absolutely 
and completely supportive one hundred percent, and would have 
taken a bullet for me.  I couldn't hang out with anyone else on the 
team.  Then there were four or so girls who were in between.  It 
was "I don't agree with your position but respect your right to do it, 
but I wish you weren't doing it because it's making life hell for the 
team."  I can respect that.  They tried to stay neutral because we 
were friends.  And they were torn kind of between me and what 
their parents thought and the season was difficult for them.

<p><b>DZ:</b>  What about your coach, Shawn Lincoln?

<p><b>TS:</b> I have to give it to him. He took a lot of slack for not punishing 
me. I think it was very important for Manhattanville, promoting itself 
as a liberal arts college who promotes socially and ethically aware 
graduates that he was so supportive.  He made it a point not to 
include what his personal views were, and I still don't know what 
he thought, but he definitely supported my right to protest, whether 
he would rather I did it or not.  I really commend him for that, 
because he didn't have to.  Not just that, but he reprimanded those 
players who were deliberately going against what his orders for 
the team [about talking to the press].  They were eventually held in 
check.

<p><b>DZ:</b>  In the Merchant Marines story, you painted a picture of a team 
that was despite its differences able to pull together.  Was that 
something that was just a one game thing?  

<p><b>TS:</b>  There was tension throughout the season.  It got to a point 
towards the end where we had to agree to disagree.  It took a lot 
more energy for them to trash me and for me to hate them than to 
just play together.  I think our team had so much potential to be a 
great team and that overpowered everything else that was going 
on.  And I think everyone realized the potential that we had to have 
a really great season and to break records that our school, our 
team has never broken, and I think that was more important.  
We ended up with the third best record in the history of 
Manhattanville. We all should take credit for that.  For certain 
games I don't know how we pulled it off.  I don't know how we just 
played together and did it, but we did.  And we played very well as a 
team. 

<p><b>DZ:</b>  If someone were to come up to you and ask, "Protests were 
happening through the spring.  Why demonstrate on the 
basketball court? Why you're your stand there?" What would you 
say? 

<p><b>TS:</b> I would say that it wasn't really a stand.  It was just, "I'm here to 
play basketball and I have to salute the flag?  I don't want to." 
Manhattanville is a small Division III school.  Our fans consisted of 
close friends, family, and a few girls.  Not more than sixty people 
would be at the games.  So it would not be the best place to get a 
message out.

<p><b>DZ:</b> What do you say to people who counter, "Sports is no place for 
a political acts"?

<p><b>TS:</b> I say that during World War II, when America decided that we 
needed to show our superiority to other countries, they 
implemented the National Anthem before sporting events and 
when they did that they put politics in the middle of sports.  The 
question is not why did I choose to turn my back on the flag.  It's 
why do we have to do this at basketball games? If they don't want 
politics in sports then they need to take the National Anthem out 
because that is inherently political.  

<p><b>DZ:</b> We just passed the 35th anniversary of the Tommie Smith and 
John Carlos's medal stand Olympic protests.  When you were 
doing this, were you conscious that you were part of a tradition of 
sports and politics?  

<p><b>TS:</b>  I was aware of Muhammad Ali, and I was aware of Tommy 
Smith and John Carlos.  But I didn't connect myself to them.  I saw 
one article that had my picture right next to theirs, and I was 
completely blown away.  That was the first time I connected the 
two. I didn't feel in any way like it was on the same scale. I will say 
that like [Smith and Carlos] the point was not to put myself forward 
but to get people to talk about these issues.  Last year people 
didn't want to acknowledge that we were going to war.  They 
wanted to hide it.  It can become really easy to not acknowledge 
the fact that we are killing people in other countries because it's 
not here.  A big issue I had with September 11th was that was the 
first event since Pearl Harbor where there was an attack of such 
magnitude on this country.  And you could see this all over the 
place, people going "never forget, never forget 9/11." 9/11 was 
terrible, but that level of destruction is every single day for other 
people in other countries. I think that it is unbelievably arrogant to 
say  [in the aftermath of 9/11]"now we can do whatever we want."  It 
has sent the message that "we are better than you.  We are 
superior human beings to everyone else in the world." It's really 
appalling. 

<p><b>DZ:</b>  Were you asked about speaking at any anti-war 
demonstrations?

<p><b>TS:</b>  After the season, I was asked once or twice to come and 
speak, and I declined.  I felt like if I was going to attend 
demonstrations, I was going to attend then as a regular person, 
not a person of importance.  If it ever got to the point where I was 
speaking at a rally it would be because I had done the work, I had 
paid the dues, and I didn't feel like I deserved that.  

<p><b>DZ:</b> Did you ever feel physically threatened during this whole 
process?

<p><b>TS:</b>  The guy who walked onto the court with the flag; I actually 
didn't feel threatened by him.  I think we were all in too much 
shock- as to how he got onto the court and why he was interrupting 
our game to do this- to even be scared about it.  It wasn't until 
afterwards, when my family and a few of my friends were really 
outraged.  'How could this school let him get on the campus?  
What if he had a weapon?  You're not safe.' Then I got a bit 
concerned; but I still wasn't scared.  I got one letter in the mail that 
was a death threat.  It said, "I've seen you, I've been close enough 
to touch you, I'm a disabled veteran, I'll find you again, you won't be 
able to disrespect my country anymore, I'll make sure that it's an 
end for you."  That scared me.  I was a little bit frightened after that, 
and I was more cautious about where I went for a little while. 

<p><b>DZ:</b>  Did you feel like any of the coverage was skewed because of 
sexism?  

<p><b>TS:</b>  I didn't think it at first.  Someone brought it to my attention. 
They said, "You're threatening.  You are saying things that no one 
is saying right now.  You're protesting things that people are too 
afraid to protest, and you're a woman."  And they said that even 
though Muhammad Ali and Tommie Smith and John Carlos 
protested and were reprimanded, they were men.  That puts you in 
an entirely different category and people don't know how to deal 
with it.  That really got me thinking after that.  I still don't know what 
conclusions I've come to because of it, but I definitely feel like it is 
a story of its own because people don't expect women to be bold 
and speak out. I think when women do then that puts you in 
another category, which is "you must be a lesbian, you must be 
mean, you're not a lady."  It brings up hundreds of other stories. 
We've seen that happen with other female athletes; ones who 
don't pose for magazines, ones who come out and say they're 
lesbians.  It completely discredits you as an athlete, as a person.  
People don't want to hear your story after that.  Even in a lot of the 
letters I got, it went back to my looks. It all went back to my physical 
appearance. : I got a lot of "you're a rich white girl who doesn't 
know anything."  I want to know where they got that information. I'm 
definitely not rich, I'm not all white, and the white part of me is 
Jewish so you're really off on that.  

<p><b>DZ:</b>  It's been a year.  How has the stand you took changed your 
life? 

<p><b>TS:</b>  I definitely have grown mentally.  Part of that is due to the 
stand I took.  Part of that is just the course that the world is taking 
and seeing it through my own eyes without the restraints of 
college, without the restraints of parents. I work for an organization 
where we deal with teenagers I'm a lot more conscious of the 
development of teenagers and young people and their mindset.
 
<p><b>DZ:</b>  What about the actual events in the world the last year?  Do 
feel like the course of events in Iraq has validated the stand that 
you took?  

<p><b>TS:</b>  It was always validated to me, and nothing anyone ever said 
invalidated or made me question what I did.  The only thing I ever 
questioned was my safety and the safety of my family and friends.  
But the way I felt at the time was that there were many protests 
during the Vietnam War that outraged people.  Then when 
circumstances came to light about how illegal the war was and 
how many killed and died senselessly, people said, "Oh, now I get 
it."  I think that's what's happening now.  There are stories now that 
have been done about me- because it's the end of the year and 
people are recapping- and the tone is more supportive.  There are 
a lot of people who were angry at the time, saying, "How dare you 
not support my son, he's going off to war."  And now either their 
son has died or their son is still over there, and they realize that 
this war is bogus and. they don't have any health insurance or 
have to wait on line for food.  Now they say, "oh, I get it.  Now I get 
what you were trying to say.  And now my son is over there, my 
daughter's over there and I can't help when I could have helped 
before."  So I think a lot of what has come to light, as we knew it 
would- because they couldn't keep it hidden forever. If that 
validates it for other people then I'm glad.  They don't have to agree 
with me but at least they can understand why.  

<p><b>DZ:</b>  Do you have any regrets?

<p><b>TS:</b>  None. I'm really big on not living with regrets.  There are 
always things in your life you're not going to be happy with, choices 
you've made that you're not pleased with, but every choice you 
make you make it for a reason and you might not know that that 
reason is until later, and it might hurt you at the time, but eventually 
it pans out and it shapes who you are as a person.  Anything that I 
would have done differently would have altered who I am now. 

<p><b>DZ:</b>  Do have any last comments

<p><b>TS:</b>  Yes. I was one of those kids who went to overcrowded 
schools with no books and we had to recycle Xerox copies.  That 
was a choice that I made, and that my mother made, and I've never 
regretted it. When I got to college, and I told my stories of high 
school- how we didn't have a gym, how we played in a junior high 
school across the street- they said "oh my god!  I can't believe you 
had to do this, I can't believe you didn't have this, you didn't have 
books!"  And then we were assigned to write ten-page research 
papers, and none of them knew how to do it.  I was in a higher 
writing class than any of my friends and they were complaining, 
"How can I write a three page paper?  What's an introduction?  
How do I end it?"  They didn't know one thing from another. It is 
unfair that there is such unequal funding between school districts, 
but there is something to gain from every situation. Examine where 
you feel overlooked, uncounted, deemed unimportant, and use it to 
build yourself up. I would not trade the education I received for an 
education at a private school. It's all about what you take from life, 
not what you feel life is or is not giving you. The script is unwritten 
until we write our own stories.
