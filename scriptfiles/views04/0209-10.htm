<p>While the Bush administration publicly embraces accountability for Saddam Hussein and other alleged perpetrators of crimes against humanity, warlords in Afghanistan continue to reign, exempted from punishment. Even as Hamid Karzai, Afghanistan's president, struggles to control the wayward regional commanders, the United States is providing them with a perverse legitimacy.

<p>Ultimately, those most culpable in past, present and possible future injustices must be held accountable.

<p>Call them what you want - regional leaders, commanders or warlords - Abdurrashid Dostum, Atta Mohammad and the others may be responsible for mass killings that fill graves in the barren landscape of northern Afghanistan. They rely on a culture of impunity that is traditional among warlords in northern Afghanistan to sustain them in power.

<p>As investigators for Physicians for Human Rights, we visited dozens of mass graves in the vicinity of Mazar-i-Sharif. The victims lie in layers, with the most recent on top.

<p>Reputedly, Northern Alliance commanders thwarted a Taliban assault in 1997, killing thousands. In 1998 the Taliban took Mazar-i-Sharif and murdered thousands in retaliation.

<p>Two years ago, the U.S.-led coalition, allied with the Northern Alliance, defeated the Taliban and drove them out of power. Between 8,000 and 10,000 Taliban and Al Qaeda forces reportedly surrendered at the northern city of Konduz to the Northern Alliance, led by two rival commanders, Dostum and Atta Mohammad. Some of the captured forces were sent to Guantánamo Bay, where many remain. Others were held in Afghan prisons. While some were released, hundreds, maybe thousands, are still unaccounted for.

<p>Where are they? In January 2002, we found nearly 3,000 of them being held in squalid conditions in an old prison in the town of Shebarghan, about an hour west of Mazar-i-Sharif. The prison was under the control of Dostum, whose palatial headquarters were across the street.

<p>But even counting those crowded into the dilapidated prison, the whereabouts of many remained unknown. We began to suspect that a significant portion might have met their fate on the way there. Indeed, after we left the prison and traveled down the road a few miles into the desert, we smelled the unmistakable odor of decaying flesh and soon found bulldozer tracks and skeletal remains.

<p>A few months later, under the auspices of the UN high commissioner for human rights, our forensic expert exhumed 15 bodies and performed preliminary autopsies on three. Initial findings confirmed that the deaths were caused by asphyxiation. Witnesses later reported that hundreds of prisoners had died in sealed container trucks taking them to Shebarghan. For months, Physicians for Human Rights called for investigation of the grave site, only to be stonewalled by the U.S. Defense and State Departments.

<p>After reports of the mass grave were widely publicized, the United Nations agreed to investigate the site, and Dan Bartlett, the White House spokesman, said, "The proper course for an investigation or inquiry will be made at a later date."

<p>Although U.S. Special Forces were present at the surrender and embedded in the headquarters of Dostum and Atta, they have said they did not follow the trucks and never saw sealed containers. Dostum himself acknowledged that up to 200 prisoners of war died in his forces' custody.

<p>The mass grave, possibly containing hundreds if not thousands of bodies, has yet to be fully investigated and remains unprotected. Some eyewitnesses have either been killed or disappeared, and no offers of protection by international security forces in Afghanistan have been forthcoming.

<p>Sergio Viera de Mello, the former UN high commissioner for human rights who was killed in Baghdad, understood the importance of the investigation, as do Karzai and the former head UN representative in Afghanistan, Lakhdar Brahimi. All publicly supported securing the site.

<p>The United States, however, has refused to support a full investigation publicly. This not only gives the warlords a new confidence that they will retain their power and never be held responsible for past crimes, but severely undermines support for justice and the rule of law.

<p>Some say that Afghanistan, struggling to recover from a quarter-century of war, is too fragile to support efforts to account for past crimes. Others, including Afghan human rights groups, say unless crimes are dealt with, a corrosive culture of vengeance will persist and there will be no peace.

<p>The wounds of Afghanistan will never fully heal if those most responsible are given a wink and a nod. If the U.S. government continues its cavalier approach toward its proxy forces, choosing to look the other way and ignoring universally accepted laws and principles of war, its goal of spreading democracy and the rule of law will never be met in Afghanistan.
