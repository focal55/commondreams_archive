<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><P>The staggering defeat of the Democratic Party and its 
ever-accelerating death spiral weren't obvious from the election 
results. Two factors masked the extent of the party's trouble. 
Without the innovation of Internet-driven small-donor fund-raising 
and a corresponding surge in support from the youngest voters, John 
Kerry would have suffered a dramatically larger defeat. And the true 
magnitude of the Democrats' abject failure at the polls in 2004 would 
have been more clearly revealed.

<p>Mr. Kerry raised nearly half of his war chest over the Internet. He 
was so successful at this that he actually outspent the Bush 
campaign. But it was the outsider campaign of Howard Dean, reviled by 
most of the Democratic establishment, that pioneered the use of the 
Internet to raise millions in small contributions; Mr. Kerry was just 
the beneficiary as the party nominee. And it was the risk-taking Dean 
campaign that forced the risk-averse Kerry campaign to opt out of the 
public financing system. Had that decision not been forced on Mr. 
Kerry, he would have been badly outspent by George Bush; he would not 
have been competitive at all throughout the long summer of 2004.

<p>Mr. Kerry's lead among young voters hid just how bad Election Day 
really was for Democrats. In 2000, voters between 18 and 29 split 
their votes evenly: nine million each for Mr. Bush and Al Gore. But 
in 2004, two million more voters in this age group turned out to 
vote. And while Mr. Bush won the same nine million, 11 million voted 
for Mr. Kerry. But when we set aside his two million new younger 
voters, the true disaster is revealed. In 2000, Mr. Gore and Ralph 
Nader won a combined total of 54 million votes. This year Mr. Kerry 
and Mr. Nader got 53 million (ignoring the two million new young 
voters).

<p>Mr. Kerry was a weaker candidate than Mr. Gore. He lost so much 
ground among women, Hispanics, and other key groups, that the 
millions in Internet money, the most Herculean get-out-the-vote 
effort in party history, and the largest turnout of young voters in 
over a decade, couldn't save him. Had the young stayed home, the sea 
of red on the map would have grown to include at least Pennsylvania, 
Wisconsin and New Hampshire -- perhaps one or two more.

<p>Meanwhile, Mr. Bush, received 50 million votes in 2000, and 59 
million in 2004. He added nine million votes. That's because Karl 
Rove had a plan and the campaign executed it brilliantly. But the 
problem for Democrats is not Mr. Rove; it's that they're doing the 
same thing over and over again, expecting a different result. That's 
the definition of insanity.

<p>Since the Democratic Leadership Council, with its mantra of 
"moderate, moderate, moderate," took hold in D.C., the party has been 
in decline at just about every level of government. Forget the Kerry 
loss. Today the number of Democrats in the House is the lowest it's 
been since 1948. Democrats are on the brink of becoming a permanent 
minority party. Can the oldest democratic institution on earth wake 
from its stupor? Here are some steps to pull out of the nose-dive:

<p><ul><li>Democrats can't keep ignoring their base. Running to the middle and 
then asking our base to make sure to vote isn't a plan. And to those 
who say talking to your base doesn't work -- Read the Rove 2004 
playbook!
 
</li></ul><p><ul><li>Democrats must reconnect with the energy of our grass roots. One of 
the failures of the DLC was that its ideas never helped us build a 
grass-roots donor base. As a result, Democrats held a lead over 
Republicans in only one fundraising category before this election 
cycle: contributions over one million dollars. That shows how far the 
party had strayed from grassroots fundraising before the Dean 
campaign. We must build a base of at least seven million small donors 
by 2006. With the Internet it's possible. But it can't just be about 
the money, it also has to be about ideas.
 
</li></ul><p><ul><li>The one thing we learned in the Dean campaign was that the 30 
people in Burlington weren't as smart as the 650,000 Americans who 
were part of our campaign. Instead of a DLC in D.C., Democrats should 
be holding Democratic Grassroots Councils in every county. Democratic 
National Committee members in each state, along with the state party, 
should host and moderate these meetings to develop ideas that come 
from the people, instead of the experts in D.C.
 
</li></ul><p><ul><li>A party that ignores the needs of state and local parties is 
doomed. We must begin to invest aggressively in states we continually 
write off in national elections. If we don't, the decline of the 
party in these states will continue until we're non-existent. Look at 
the south.
 
</li></ul><p><ul><li>In a world in which companies like Wal-Mart pay substandard wages 
with no real benefits, our party has got to find innovative ways to 
support organized labor's growth. A declining union membership is not 
good for the country, it's not good for working people, and it 
certainly isn't good for the Democratic Party.
 
</li></ul><p><ul><li> The Democratic Party has to be the vehicle that empowers the 
American people to change our failed political system. We all know 
the damn thing is broken. Democrats should lead the way by placing 
stricter money restrictions on candidates than the toothless Federal 
Election Commission does. A party funded by contributions from the 
people can do this. A corrupted and corroded party cannot. The 
Democratic Party shouldn't wait for campaign-finance reform -- it 
should be campaign-finance reform.
 
</li></ul><p><ul><li> Finally, what is the purpose the party strives for today? What are 
our goals for the nation? You couldn't tell from the election. Very 
few good ideas come from the middle, and they tend to be mediocre. 
Consultants have become adept at keeping candidates in that safe 
zone. But the time has come to develop bold ideas and challenge 
people to sacrifice for the common good. Experts will tell you that 
you can't ask the American people to sacrifice individually for the 
common good. Those experts are wrong -- it's just been so long since 
anyone has asked them.
