<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p>I've been giving a lot of thought lately to a conversation I overheard 
at a
Starbucks in Nashville last winter. It was a cold and rainy night as I 
worked
away at my laptop, but the comforting aroma of cappuccino kept me 
going. My
comfort was interrupted, however, by two young men who sat down in 
upholstered
chairs near my table. One was talking, the other listening, in what 
appeared to
be an informal college orientation.

<p>"The only trouble with David Lipscomb (a conservative Christian college
nearby) is that old man Lipscomb apparently didn't like football. So we 
don't
have a football team, but we have a great faculty."

<p>"But you do have to be careful about one thing," he said more quietly, 
coming
closer and speaking in hushed tones, "My professor-I have this great
professor-told me that you have to be careful not to get too much 
education,
because you could lose your foundation, your core values."

<p>The neophyte nodded solemnly, his eyebrows raised with worry.

<p>"If you get a bachelors," the seasoned student reassured, "you'll 
probably be
okay. But my professor said that when you get a master's, and 
definitely if you
go beyond that, you can lose your values. He said that college students 
have to
be watchful because if you get too much education, you could turn 
LIBERAL. He's
seen it happen to a lot of good Christians."

<p>Both young men looked around again to make sure no-one was listening
(unfortunately my hearing is excellent, even when I wish it weren't), 
and
shuddered visibly. They shook their heads at the terrifying fate that 
could
befall them.

<p>I found it hard to concentrate after that, my mind returning again and 
again to
one question: "What would happen to higher education in America if this 
fear of
"too much education", and this presumption that liberal views are the 
devil's
snare rather than the logical consequences of exposure to science, 
philosophy,
literature and diversity, became widespread?"

<p>Sadly, it has already happened, and is growing on college campuses 
across the
US. A recent article by Justin Pope, "Conservatives Flip Academic 
Freedom
Debate: Liberal professors are accused of attempting to indoctrinate 
students.
But some teachers say pupils are trying to avoid new ideas." (AP, 
12/25/04)
describes this anti-liberal movement, weakly disguised as "balancing" 
their
courses with conservative views:

<p>"Leading the movement is Students for Academic Freedom, with chapters 
on 135
campuses and close ties to David Horowitz, a onetime liberal campus 
activist
turned conservative commentator. The group posts student complaints on 
its
website about alleged episodes of grading bias and unbalanced, 
anti-American
propaganda by professors - often in classes.

<p>"Instructors "need to make students aware of the spectrum of scholarly 
opinion,"
Horowitz said. "You can't get a good education if you're only getting 
half the
story.""

The "other half" of the story may not be factual, however, but 
doctrinal. As the
young man in Starbucks said just before he and the incoming freshman 
got up to
leave,

<p>"Even at Lipscomb, you have to be careful what you pay attention to. My
professor said that a few faculty members might lead you astray without 
meaning
to, by bringing in ideas that aren't biblical. He said that if you're 
ever
taught anything that sounds questionable, you should talk about it with 
your
minister to see if it's right."

<p>Even as a Christian raised in the evangelical tradition, this shocked 
me. I
suppose it shouldn't have; the Southern Baptist Convention recently 
considered a
proposal to urge all parents to pull their children out of public 
schools to
prevent their exposure to "non-biblical ideas" which, as it happens, 
run rampant
in fields like medicine, physics, archeology, literature, philosophy, 
history,
astronomy, psychology, theology-in short, everything.

<p>What will happen to that innovative American spirit if radical 
"conservatives"
have their way with our educational system? How will the US fare in the 
global
marketplace when certain ideas, or entire fields, become off-limits to 
students
who've been indoctrinated to consult their ministers before learning 
new
information?

<p>What will happen to medical research, for instance, if this movement 
proceeds to
its logical conclusion: outlawing the scientific method, a method 
notorious for
not relying on biblical principles?

<p>I fear men like Horowitz because uncensored education is essential to 
our
democracy, our people's well-being and the nation's long-term survival. 
The
"conservative" movement that he's spearheading reminds me of the news 
reports
coming out of Iran in the months just prior to the conservative 
religious
takeover of that country when its professors were warned to present the
"correct" views in class.

<p>This movement pretends to be about "balancing" liberal with 
conservative views,
but the reality is a lot uglier than that. As the conversation I 
overheard
suggests, this movement isn't about balance, it's about censorship-or 
even
better, self-censorship that's easily achieved by frightening students 
with
social rejection, hellfire or both. Either way, scholarship is degraded 
in the
process. According to the article,

"many educators, while agreeing that students should never feel 
bullied, worry
that they just want to avoid exposure to ideas that challenge their 
core beliefs
- an essential part of education. Some also fear that teachers will shy 
away
from sensitive topics or fend off criticism by "balancing" their 
syllabuses with
opposing viewpoints, even if they represent inferior scholarship."

<p>Whether through self-censorship or junk education, our country's 
children are
paying the price for the political aggression of the far right. Robert 
Frost
once wrote, <em>"Education is the ability listen to almost anything without 
losing
your temper."

</em>
<p>Tempers are short in today's radical "conservative" America, 
and the
emboldened radical right is in no mood to listen to anyone.
