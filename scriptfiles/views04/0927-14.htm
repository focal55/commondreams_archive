<p>In assessing President Bush's four-year economic performance, the standard measures show overwhelmingly that his record puts him at the bottom among the post-World War II presidents.

<p>Also, the average family has lost ground during Bush's presidency. Since 2000, median family income (adjusted for inflation) has dropped by $1,535, or 3.4 percent, to $43,318.

<p>When the eight previous postwar recoveries are measured two years out from their low points, the average annual real growth rate is 5.7 percent. Bush's economic growth rate is one-third lower at 3.6 percent, the lowest annual growth rate except for his father, George H.W. Bush.

<p>George W. Bush has the worst performance on job creation of the postwar presidents with roughly a million net jobs lost since his inauguration. He will join Herbert Hoover as the only presidents to experience such a net decline of jobs.

<p>In 2003, the number of people in poverty and those with no health insurance rose for the third straight year. Since 2000, the ranks of the poor had increased by 4.3 million persons. The number of individuals who were uninsured reached a record high of 45 million. Bush's 2003 budget deficit of $445 billion is the highest in history.

<p>In the face of such results, Bush has sought to put the blame on extraordinary difficulties, such as the recession and the terrorist attacks, and claim that he has turned the economy around. His administration has ballyhooed 12 straight months of job gains that yielded 1.7 million new jobs -- an average of 140,000 new jobs a month -- as a signal achievement.

<p>These gains, however, fall almost 40 percent below the average increase of 230,000 jobs a month at comparable points after the last two recessions in the early '80s and early '90s.

<p>Thus, the Bush administration's one-year shortfall is over a million new jobs (12 months times 90,000 fewer jobs) less than the average performance by Presidents George H.W. Bush and Clinton.

<p>The assertion that his performance has suffered because of more difficult problems is questionable. What Bush confronted, even the attacks, were not necessarily tougher economic challenges than those faced by past presidents. Rather Bush's dismal performance on almost every economic measure comes from his inefficient tax cuts totaling $1.7 trillion.

<p>Such tax reductions stimulated economic activity but were far too costly and became the main cause of the massive deficits. In their April 2004 report , "Tax Returns," Isaac Shapiro and Joel Friedman, senior fellows at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities wrote that "the tax cuts are responsible for more than half of 2004 deficit."

<p>Efficient stimuli would have been concentrated on putting funds in the hands of those who would spend it rapidly. Shapiro and Friedman have noted that Bush spurned the most efficient means, such as extending unemployment insurance benefits that generate 73 cents per dollar of lost revenue. Instead, he unwisely opted for a dividend tax reductions that only generated 9 cents, and hence far greater budget deficits.

<p>The most dangerous results from Bush's economic policies are those that have provided corporate America and the wealthy a disproportionately high share of the benefits and greater power at the expense of ordinary citizens.

<p>Columbia University historian Alan Brinkley has written: "Since 1932, we have not had a president who has been more closely allied with business and more sympathetic to large and powerful corporations."

<p>During the past three years, Bush's tax cuts have provided as much of his total reduction in income taxes to the top 1 percent of the population, whose average yearly earnings are $1.2 million, as to the bottom 80 percent. The middle class now has a larger share of the tax burden and faces a materially heightened threat to its long-term economic security.

<p>The worsening income disparities between the rich and ordinary citizens -- the greatest since the 1920s -- have been a major factor pushing the nation into plutocratic governance. The tax reductions for the wealthy and major business firms provided money that helped fuel the campaigns of Washington politicians.

<p>Under George W. Bush, the United States has become a government of the corporation, by the corporation and for the corporation, to paraphrase Abraham Lincoln's Gettysburg Address. Such an entrenched plutocracy is totally incompatible with the form of governance created by the Constitution to support representative democracy.

<p>This dimension of Bush's failed fiscal policies carries his performance into a different, frightening realm from his postwar predecessors. My overall assessment is that Bush's four-year economic record is not only the worst in the postwar era but also by far the most dangerous for America's future economic and political health.
