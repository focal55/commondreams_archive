<p>Canadian Prime Minister Martin is due to meet George
Bush today at the "Summit of the Americas" in Mexico.
While missile defense, terrorism and trade issues will
no doubt top their agenda, an equally crucial matter
will be hidden from the headlines: the raging Franco-US
battle and its troubling implications for Canada.


<p>Last year,  France's strong opposition to the war in
Iraq angered the U.S., and since then there's been a
sharp jump in transatlantic tensions. Six
Christmas-time flights between Paris and Los Angeles
  <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3363291.stm" target="_new">were halted</a> because the FBI said it had found
"suspicious" names on passenger lists. It later turned out none of suspected passengers had presented any security risk whatsoever - one was a Welsh insurance salesman and another was a young child. France immediately accused the FBI of sloppiness, and US officials shot back by saying Air France was infiltrated by Islamic extremists.


<p>Then  political fires were stoked  when a prominent
French judge threatened to take US Vice President
  <a href="http://www.commondreams.org/scriptfiles/views03/1231-14.htm" target="_new">Cheney to court</a> over allegations of bribery and money laundering.  It concerns a time when Cheney was CEO of the energy giant Halliburton, which was negotiating a lucrative deal in Nigeria. These charges will not sit well with the White House - especially in an election year.


<p>But the Bush Administration is fighting back. Pentagon
adviser Richard Perle just released a book entitled,
"An End to Evil: How to Win the War on Terror," which
claims, among other revelations, that France should be
treated as an enemy and, "We should force European
governments to choose between Paris and Washington."


<p>And this is where the new Canadian Prime Minister steps
in.


<p>Former Prime Minister Chretien had angered the White
House by refusing to send troops to Iraq, and in
response Canada got the cold shoulder from Bush. In
contrast, Martin has pledged to improve the
relationship between Canada and its southern neighbor,
but he's walking on thin ice.


<p>If Pentagon advisers publicly warn Europe to choose the
US over France, what about Canada? The Bush
Administration's "You're with us or against us" policy
leaves little room for maneuvering.


<p>Perle's book also calls for aggressive action against
Syria and North Korea, and of course, the White House
would love Canadian troops to participate.


<p>So Prime Minister Martin, and indeed every Canadian,
has a choice: either support the United States in its "pre-emptive" wars or instead, choose the path of international diplomacy. Either risk the lives of Canadian troops in Bush's ongoing battles or simply refuse.


<p>Because ultimately it isn't a choice between the United
States and France, but rather a choice between
perpetual war and sustainable peace.


<p>The bottom line: a strong and opinionated Canada is a
powerful counterbalance to US intransigence, and one
that will be ever more crucial in the years ahead.
