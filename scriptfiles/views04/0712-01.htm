<p>We sat around the dining room table, five women stuffing envelopes. Letter, issues sheet, donation envelope. Repeat. We need your money. We need your time. It's that simple.

<p>My daughter, <a href="http://www.tracyforcongress.com/" target="_new">Tracy Velazquez</a>, is running a textbook grassroots campaign, and she's running it in Montana, where there's a lot of grass but only one Congressional seat for the entire state. She has to reach Montana's 900,000 residents who are spread out across small towns, ranches and reservations, and her campaign is taking her across 147,000 square miles of mountains and plains in a state where 53 of the 56 counties are larger than Rhode Island. The tread on her truck tires is quickly wearing away.

<p>This is a David and Goliath campaign. Tracy's opponent is a wealthy and well-funded Republican incumbent. Donations to her campaign come in small amounts from the citizens of a state that has the distinction of being No. 1 in the country for adults who hold more than one job and 38th in personal income. In many respects, the problems of Montanans are just like those of voters in other regions of the country. In others, they are unique.

<p>More than 90 percent of Montana businesses have fewer than 20 employees. While the state has traditionally relied on "extractive" industries--mining and lumber--these jobs are disappearing and being replaced by service-sector and tourism-related work. Ranchers and farmers continue to raise cattle, sheep, wheat, barley, and sugar beets, but are battling "brown collar" outsourcing (brown for the color of the Carhartt jackets they wear), as trade agreements increase imports and big agribusiness pushes out family farms.

<p>In her work as a public health consultant, Tracy crisscrosses Montana back roads and highways, as well as the country, coast-to-coast. As a candidate, she travels these same roads with the goal of becoming only the second woman in history to represent the people of Montana in Congress. Jeannette Rankin
(R) was elected twice, from 1917-1919 and from 1941-1943, and was the first woman in the country to serve in the House and the only woman to vote for the Nineteenth Amendment.

<p>Tracy is visiting farmers' markets, bucking horse sales, college campuses, and union meetings. She may speak to a roomful of people or just one family. She understands their concerns because she has children too. Tracy is debating the incumbent face-to-face and responding to her detractors, while pulling in more and more support. She personally answers the e-mails that come to her site, adding to her blog as issues are raised.

<p>There are about thirty progressive bumper stickers on my old car, not only on the bumpers, but also on the back panel and windows. When I return to the car after picking up my mail at the post office or buying groceries, I often spy people standing behind it, reading them. I usually wait a minute, then walk over and ask them if they agree. In this conservative state, more and more people seem to be. I recently added one that is her Web site, TracyForCongress.com, right under the "Vote" sticker with the O shown as a peace sign.

<p>The day after she announced, I was in the checkout line at the market when a woman approached me. She said, "I just want you to know how much I enjoy driving behind you around town, reading your bumper stickers." "You know," I said, "If you like my bumper stickers, you're going to love my daughter." She looked at me funny, and then I told her who my daughter was. She let out a shriek, and all of the other woman within earshot rushed over to see what was going on. She explained who I was, who Tracy was, and how she was running against the incumbent that Montana politics allowed couldn't be beaten by a Democrat. One of the women looked thoughtful and said, "Well, I guess it's time for me to register to vote." The woman was in her forties.

<p>I'm proud of my daughter's commitment and drive, and also for being an example to the volunteers who have come forward. She and they represent most of us--individuals and families with responsibilities, budgets, bills, and concerns. For Congress to act on the issues about which we are impassioned, we must be part of it. People who are on fire with commitment to those issues must be encouraged to enter politics, and supported when they do. Can we get to that place where we can make the changes we desire? In the words of Cesar Chavez, "Si se puede," "Yes we can," even if it means getting there one seat at a time.
