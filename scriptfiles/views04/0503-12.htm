<p>Big time middlemen merchants have a hard time avoiding conflicts of 
interests where they say they represent your interests as buyers while 
they are receiving kickbacks or, more politely, "retrospective 
commissions" from the sellers.  Such situations undermine making deals 
on your behalf that are on the merits of the product or service instead 
of on the money secretly passing from the sellers to the agent, broker 
or any other Mr. In Between.

 <p>  Tens of billions of dollars are at stake here every year.  It has 
been going on for decades before an investigative reporter or law 
enforcement agency stumbles on the practice whether through a 
whistleblower or simply random discovery.  Such are the features of the 
growing epidemic of corporate crime, fraud and abuse -- it goes on and 
on, known to thousands of people in the industry, but years go by before 
it is publically detected.

  <p> But now a veritable Niagara has been unleashed.  As Steven Pearlstein 
writes in the Washington Post: "In truth, the drug industry now is built 
on a foundation of kickbacks masquerading as marketing expenses."  He 
and others noted that last month Medco -- the large pharmacy benefits 
manager, (PBM) that allegedly negotiates lower prices for health plans 
and their patients, settled charges that it received over $400 million 
from just one drug company (Merck) in just one year  2001 to favor drugs 
by that company even if they were more expensive or another drug was 
prescribed.  For this bonanza, Medco settled for a mere
$29 million with 20 states Attorneys General.  Criminogenic behavior 
pays indeed.  And what about all the other years?

 <p>  The kickback tsunami comes in waves.  First were the disclosed 
conflicts involving security analysts who touted stocks for you to buy 
whiletheir colleagues or even themselves were dumping them.  Of course, 
they just needed cash for their son's wedding or they thought it prudent 
to diversify their firm's portfolio.  Ah, yes.

 <p>  Then, as Professor John C. Coffee Jr. of Columbia Law School, pointed 
out, there were the mutual funds favoring wealthy clients with "timing" 
purchases after hours and in other ways over the regular Joes and Janes 
they had as trusting clients.  Then, he adds, there were the securities 
brokers marketing products from the mutual funds.

 <p>  Most recently, it turns out those giant commercial insurance brokers 
like Marsh Inc., Willis Group Holdings, Aon and others were taking 
payments from the insurance companies to promote their business before 
the brokers' trusting corporate clients that believed brokers were arms 
length searchers for the best insurance policies.  Big money is involved 
here -- a total of $656 million in insurance company payments in  2003 
just to the top eight brokers.

 <p>  Who can you trust in the marketplace of deceit, coverup and breach of 
fiduciary duties?  Well let's see.  Can we trust the boards of directors 
of these companies, the outside accounting firms, the outside law firms, 
the state and federal regulators, the state and federal legislative 
committees?  To ask the question of these supposed sentinels is to 
answer it.  They, year after year, look the other way.  They are paid to 
look the other way or they are receiving campaign contributions to look 
the other way.  Still they cannot be excused.  There is something rotten 
in the state of Wall Street, in the state of brokerdom or agentdom.  Yet 
the carrier of the rot never seems to go to jail to have time to think 
things over.  The thefts never seem to be paid back fully plus interest 
and penalties.

 <p>  I listened to a recent House hearing on C-Span radio a few weeks ago 
watching a minuet between the Subcommittee Chairman, who used to be in 
the real estate industry, lather witnesses from his former occupation 
whowere denouncing one of the very few pro-consumer moves by the Bush 
Administration.  This proposed rule would require mortgage brokers to 
disclose how much they are paid (wholesale markups are the euphemism) so 
that consumers can compare costs and upfront fees.  The corporate 
witnesses were trying to explain that the Department of Housing and 
Urban Affairs proposal would cost consumers more and produce no 
benefit.  That's what they think about the consumer's right to know and 
deconstruct the gobbledygook called "yield spread premium."

 <p> The remarkable resistance of corporate crime and fraud to being 
uprooted through the years suggests that they are above and beyond the 
law, when they do not produce the enabling laws in the first place that 
gives them de facto immunity and cover.  Examples are their lobbying to 
repeal the usury laws in the Seventies in most states, or making sure 
that the laws do not have criminal penalties for criminal practices.

  <p> Caveat emptor (let the buyer beware) is our governments' consumer 
protection policies these days.  Some day, consumers will band together 
and do the uprooting themselves.
