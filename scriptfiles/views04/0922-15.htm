<p>The war on civil liberties is now three years old. It was conceived at the instant that the September 11 attacks spurred a government with imperialist designs to exploit the perfect combination of widespread ignorance and fear. The post-attack panic instantly legitimized the distortion of constitutional freedom to accommodate a new concept of “national security.” An era of homegrown, state-sponsored terror was born.

 

<p>September 11 set the stage for a crackdown on immigrants of unprecedented vigor and brutality. Within weeks, over 1200 mostly Muslim and Arab immigrants were locked up; many were later deported. The Department of Justice has admitted prison staff frequently abused detainees at New York’s Metropolitan Detention Center, where 762 immigrants were held on minor immigration violations. Arab and Muslim communities across the country have suffered through FBI harassment and “volunteer” interrogations.

 

<p>Recent legislative proposals belatedly attempt to repair some of the deterioration of our constitutional rights. The Homeland Security Civil Rights and Civil Liberties Protection Act, for example, gives teeth to the Officer for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties within the Department of Homeland Security. Currently, this position, despite its cool-sounding name, can merely provide “constructive advice so that policy is shaped in ways that are mindful of and consistent with civil rights and civil liberties,” according to DHS’s Strategic Plan. (More succinctly, the Officer could do what activists and legal experts have been doing for years—and share the privilege of being ignored.) The bill would establish the Officer’s powers of oversight over the DHS, and would make information regarding internal investigations publicly accessible. Though it will by no means guarantee transparency, it will at least provide a legal framework to counter DHS authority.

 

<p>The Civil Liberties Restoration Act would check some of the broadest powers granted to police and officials in the anti-terrorist hysteria. First, it would rescind the DOJ’s executive order, issued days after September 11, that all immigration hearings related to the attacks be closed to the public as well as friends and relatives. The DOJ’s swift trashing of due process ultimately led to the shielding of 600 court proceedings from any sort of public oversight. The CLRA would provide some protection for immigrants as they negotiate the system, preventing detention without disclosure of charges, and ensuring the right to bail (with the ominous exception of loosely defined “flight risks” and “security threats”). Jail or deportation could not be used as punishment for “technical registration violations,” whereas under the Patriot Act, neglecting to fill out a change-of-address form could be grounds for deportation. The CLRA would also create an Immigration Review Commission to assess the conduct of immigration courts, whose authority has been handicapped by the DOJ.

 

<p>Other legislation designed to prevent the Patriot Act from suffocating civil liberties includes the Senate’s SAFE (Security and Freedom Ensured) Act, which would prohibit FBI wiretaps and secret searches without a search warrant; and the Patriot Oversight Restoration Act, which would curb reckless enforcement of immigration regulations and the labeling of political protest as “terrorism.” Introducing the bill, Senator Patrick Leahy of Vermont reflected somber regret among legislators two years after passing the Patriot Act: “In the quarter-century that I have served in the Senate, no administration has been more secretive, more resistant to congressional oversight, and more disposed to acting unilaterally, without the approval of the American people or their democratically elected representatives.”  

 

<p>Yet many members of Congress seem either content with the Patriot Act or astonishingly ignorant of the threat it poses, and several bills have aimed to strengthen it. The Terrorist Penalties Enhancement Act multitasks in its assault on human rights by automatically making any terrorist act “that results in the death of a person” punishable by death.  The Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2004, which recently passed in both houses, swells the FBI’s powers to search personal financial records as part of any “terrorist investigation.” The Antiterrorism Tools Enhancement Act enhances the tools of dictatorship by authorizing DOJ officials to subpoena information and testimony in so-called terrorism cases even if they cannot demonstrate probable cause.

 

<p>Along with the upcoming elections, in which all 435 House seats are up for grabs, these pieces of legislation may reshape the public’s conception of the legitimate scope of government power and the skewed balance of freedom and security. But as we’ve seen in the mass round-ups of immigrants and the slowly tightening noose around our everyday freedoms, the gap between the law and reality in our communities stretches each day. Protective legislation will barely begin to mend the systematic destruction of the legal basis of our liberties—the Bill of Rights. The green light for the ruthless abuse of power by the executive branch is not the permissiveness of laws per se, but the passive trust of an ill-informed public. After all, Bush and the DOJ officially “banned” racial profiling last year—but quietly exempted the racist targeting of Arabs, South Asians and Muslims in terrorism investigations. When no one is watching, even policies that seem to protect equal rights can be enforced in ways that further entrench discrimination. 

 

<p>More pivotal than the congressional debates on the Patriot Act is the public dialogue about defending our rights and resisting abuse of authority—a discourse that has colored every social movement in recent history and must now be renewed with greater urgency than ever before. Legislative actions on civil liberties reveal a growing awareness among lawmakers that we have taken a drastic, possibly irreversible step backward. But nothing will be achieved unless society as a whole is conscious and vocal—not only about our rights, but also our responsibility to protect them from authoritarian power and bigotry.

 

<p>Three years after the anti-terror alarm became a death knell for liberty, countless lives have been wrecked by deportations, detentions, and presumption of guilt, with no progress in “national security” to show for it. If we do not rise against this injustice but instead surrender to fear, allowing our government to cripple the spirit of democracy—we’ll know where the greatest damage has been done.
