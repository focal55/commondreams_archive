These  words rise past my lips with a retching pain and agony  unlike any 
horror I have ever  known.  The word Christian I was told in Sunday school 
means to be Christ-like but the message I hear daily on the airwaves from 
the “christian ”  media are words of war, violence, and aggression.  
Throughout this article I will spell christian with a small c rather than a 
capital since the term (as I usually hear it thrown about) does not refer to 
the teachings of the one I know as the Christ.   I hear the church goers 
call in to radio programs and explain that it was a mistake not to kill 
every living thing in Fallouja.  They quote chapter and verse from the old 
testament about smiting the enemies of Israel.   The fear of fighting the 
terrorists on our soil rather than across the globe  causes the vibrato in 
their voices to increase as they justify the latest prison scandal  or other 
accounts of the horrors of war .  The words they speak are words of  
destruction,  aggression,  dominance, revenge, and fear and arogance.   The 
host  and the callers echo the belief in the righteousness of our nation’s 
killing.   There are reminders to pray for our  “christian” president who is 
doing the work of the Lord:   Right to life……2nd amendment…….sanctity of 
marriage…….welfare reform, war, kill, evil liberals so much to fight ……..so 
much to destroy.

<p>Let me tell you about the Christ I know.   He was born poor to an unmarried 
women.  He was not born into a family of privilege.   He was a radical.  He 
said “it was said an eye for and eye and a tooth of a tooth (old testament) 
but now I say  (a whole new plan) love your enemies bless those who curse 
you.”  …He said “blessed are the poor in spirit for theirs is the kingdom of 
heaven…Blessed are those who mourn for they shall be comforted…blessed are 
the meek for they shall inherit the earth…Blessed are the peacemakers for 
they shall be called the children of God.” (matt 5: 3-9)  He said  “all 
those who are called by my name “(aka the Prince of Peace  (Isaiah 9:6) will 
enter the kingdom of heaven.  He said people will know  true believers if 
they  have the fruit of the spirit which is:  “love, joy , peace, patience, 
kindness, goodness, gentleness, self control. “  He said “I was hungry and 
you fed me, thirsty and you gave me a drink, sick and in prison and you 
visited me.”   He knew he would be lead like a sheep to the slaughter.  He 
responded with “Father forgive them…….. “ A sad and angry friend cut off the 
ear of a guard and Christ picked it up and healed it. He explained  that in 
Christ there is neither Jew nor gentile, slave or free male nor female. He 
explained that even to be angry is akin to murder.  He said the temple of 
God is not a building but in the hearts of those are called by his name  - 
the Prince of Peace.     He was a radical!  His final days were spent in 
prayer that he could endure what was set before him. Not how he could 
overpower the evil government of that day.   When they came for him he was 
lead away and didn’t resist even the cross.

<p>This is a stark contrast  to the call of the religious  christian right who 
vote for war and weapons http://www.commondreams.org/headlines02/1010-02.htm), suggest towns and 
villages be leveled ironically to bring freedom and peace to the people.  
Proudly boast this country’s superiority suggesting it is because God has 
blessed our nation.   Today as I listened  to a popular christian news 
network I was reminded that in the last days  even God’s elect will be 
deceived.  (II Tim 3:13) When the religious media  moguls  who preach 
prosperity spout their rhetoric I am reminded of the difficulty that Jesus 
described so vividly of a rich man’s ability to  enter the kingdom of God. 
(Matt. 19: 24) (http://www.4religious-right.info/rr_economics.htm)    Some 
who believe they are fighting evil  will say Lord Lord and he will say “I 
never knew you“ (Matt. 22).  They will have a form or godliness but will 
deny the power (II Tim. 3:5)  the power to move mountains through prayer. 
(Matt. 17:20) .  Jesus explained  that he has not give us a spirit of fear 
but power and love and a sound mind. (II Tim. 1:17)   I wonder if the 
innocent  moms and dads and brothers and sisters, and aunts and uncles, and 
grandmas and grandpas who were the victims of  US military  weapons (the 
never reported collateral damages we are protected from in the “liberal” 
nightly news) felt the love of Jesus with the shock and awe.   I wonder if 
the surviving family members now understand His radical love and realize 
that because the US has destroyed many of their towns and villages  and they 
  have lost family members to war and  their historical sites have been 
unprotected,  looted and destroyed they no longer have any need for weapons.

<p> I can’t begin to understand the statements and lifestyle of Jesus.  What 
would he say to evil dictators?  I suspect he would say what he has said to 
us all.  But, the dictators do not kill in the name of the God who is 
revealed in the New Testament.   This God  would not justify 15,000 or more  
deaths ( http://www.iraqbodycount.net/ ).  Even the wrathful jealous God of 
the old testament spared whole cities for a few righteous souls.   For 
christians to support the killing of many as a way to  prevent the fear of 
future deaths is not at all like Christ.     He would not say when I am 
talking about war I am really talking about peace  like the self professed 
christian  President  proudly states.   Who but God has the right to 
determine what price a people should pay for their freedom.   The religious 
leaders on the airwaves today respond to the voices of the few brave 
pacemakers who dare to speak out.  They say  that pacifism is insane, it 
doesn’t make sense,  not biblical and illogical…….What is forgotten is that 
if logic was all that was necessary then there wouldn’t need to be faith.  
The horrors of September eleven, the rising terror alerts, the scary chatter 
on the internet are all reminders of one very clear statement that Jesus 
made.  “Perfect Love casts out fear.” (I John 4:18)

<p>The solutions to the social issues which the “religious right” use to 
manipulate good decent people to vote for the party of perpetual war as 
means  for perpetual peace have no resemblance to how Jesus responded to the 
social concerns of his time.   He never once mentioned the “right to life” 
even though the year he was born king Herod ordered all the babies  be 
killed. (Matt 2:16)  Anthropologists and sociologists report that abortions 
have been practiced throughout history.  He knew that passing laws does not 
change the heart.   As a follower of his teaching I  believe in the right to 
life for everyone including children in Iraq who stumble into land mines,  
cross the street at the wrong time, or who are still snuggly tucked within 
the warm bellies of their wounded or grieving mothers as the US fighter jets 
fly over head.  These are living breathing children whose neural networks 
are fully formed,  Have taken that first deep breath that was breathed in 
tAdam.  They feel all the pain and horror just like you or I.  The killing 
of these little ones are never even reported and the ones who tax dollars 
paid for the bomb never even acknowledge the tragic loss..  Jesus said if 
you harm even a hair on there head you shall face judgement.  I believe in 
the right to life for those in the United States who are unwanted and who 
have the sicknesses of poverty.   I believe in the right to life of the 
naive kid who was promised by the recruiter they could choose a desk job and 
still get their education paid., or could see the world or could accelerate 
their life or could play a very realistic video game from a cockpit.

<p>I know first hand the reality of unwanted children  as a worker in a shelter 
home for the unwanted in a large Southern city (a shelter that was supported 
financially by several churches with members together totaling  more than a 
thousand) I know the reality of this right wing  rhetoric when week after 
week I begged and pleaded with people to give up only one night every three 
months  to sit with these unwanted  living  children for a few hours while 
the overworked house parents had a night off.  Of the few I found many 
changed their minds  when they discovered that they would need to wear 
rubber gloves to change the babies diapers.   These  “believers”  stand on 
the street corners holding right to life signs and then vote against medical 
assistance for the mothers and their unwanted children creating an 
impossible existence for them. The few of these abortion activists who might 
adopt some of these unwanted children generally want the white and the 
healthy and then only one. The ones with hydrocephalous, tracheotomies, 
emotional/ mental problems and communicable diseases along with their life 
long medical expenses are someone else’s problems.

<p>So I cringe as many “christians“  vote for policies that deny help to the 
poor in our own county, support the war, military strength assuring the 
latest weapons are developed and that the heavens will be dominated by the 
military of the United States. The nation  many say is founded on Christian 
principles  While we export nuclear weapons into the heavens and develop 
electromagnetic weapons to shatter skulls , split the earth 
(http://www.raven1.net/emr13.htm) and silently destroy  a body as a thief in 
the night.   Studies are even now  searching for the frequencies to override 
the freewill.  These unbelievable technologies are a reality  and DNA 
specific weapons  can or soon will target a  specific nationality 
(http://www.arabicnews.com/ansub/Daily/Day/981116/1998111619.html ) .  Some 
will be taken and the others left and the tax dollars funding the business 
of war and drug companies whose lobbyists have hood- winked the Christians 
by the shell game of politics.

<p>I weep as the waters Jesus walked on become contaminated with uranium and 
fear. (http://www.greendove.net/resources3.htm)  I grieve as the missiles 
fly through the atmosphere on the continent where Jesus rose into the sky 
defying death and the grave and where the Holy Sprit first descended. . I 
cry out at  the horrors of war and the indignity of the war time prisons so 
close to where He took captivity captive .  So I am no longer a christian if 
Christianity has become what is presented to us by  most of those on talk 
radio, broadcasts of the mega churches,  TV Christian clubs and the example 
of our christian president.  I cannot support the right of the United States 
and  Israel  to develop and  use the most heinous weapons ever imagined 
because of a few verses in Biblical law which Jesus declared were fulfilled 
at his death long ago. (Romans 8:13-15)  I want no part of a temple built on 
the blood of the innocent.  Just as many  did not recognize the Messiah 
because he came as a baby  many may not recognize the New Jerusalem as it 
approaches.  The sheep  have been lead astray by the teachings of prosperity 
and misinterpretation of  the final battle between good and evil.  Many no 
longer can recognize the voice of the good Shepard.

<p>While all this is going on the many churches across United States are filled 
with christians who work for companies who have contracts with the military. 
<p>Some “good christians”  even work at weapons facilities.  It is not a 
stretch to say that a women who tightens  a  last rivet on a shiny new 
missile just off the assembly line on Friday afternoon  might be the  same 
women who licks the gold star on the Sunday school attendance chart on 
Sunday morning.  The  missile could be  launched by  the kid in the youth 
group who often reads the invocation and it will find it’s destiny at a 
“target of interest” which might or might not have been a result of good 
intelligence.  So the collection plate circulates and the spring ground 
breaking of the  new Sunday school wing continues on schedule .  There they 
can keep teaching the children to love their enemies and bless those who 
curse them, about Peace, and love, and kindness, and the radical message of 
Jesus.

<p>I believe in the example of Jesus and his admonition to  love your enemies 
bless those who curse you .  Do I understand  how this works on the global 
scale?  Do I know what Jesus would say to  all the world’s leaders?   No.   
I don’t understand  how the example of Christ’s life and his well 
communicated  message  of love, compassion  and peace works in the world  
today- that’s why I need faith!    Am I always correct in my assessments and 
actions?  No - that’s why I need grace.   Am I brave and unafraid? No - 
that’s why I need  the perfect love that casts out fear.  Some trust in 
Chariots and some in horses but I will remember the name of the lord our God 
(aka the Prince of Peace) Perhaps politics has no place for imitators of 
Christ.

<p>Who will show the face of Christ to the world?  Who will speak His radical 
message. I hear from these so called imitators of Christ that the pacifist’s 
are a collection of kids, hippies, socialists and communists who haven’t got 
a clue.  Some of us however  have come to our beliefs as a result of careful 
and prayerful study of the scriptures and admonishment from our elders.   
Many are Mennonite, Amish, Quaker and other Anabaptists whose ancestors did  
not resist their torturers and were drowned, burnt at the stake and flogged 
for their pacifist stand.  They truly followed the example of Christ and 
their resistance against what they knew were the catastrophic effects of the 
merging of church and state cost them a great price. But churches today have 
signed on to the government plan and have agreed to look the other way in 
exchange for tax free privileges.  The true message of Christ still exists 
to some degree  in the quiet of the land…..the peacemakers but sadly even 
these good people have been deceived by the loud  angry words from a 
righteous sounding  religious media majority broadcasting  in cars and 
trucks and tractors all over our land ironically preaching the “good news of 
war for peace“ and convincing 24 hours a day 7 days a week that the press is 
“liberal“ .  I suspect there are many who share my sorrow at the loss of the 
meaning of what it means to be like Christ but our voice is seldom heard and 
the blaring  rhetoric drowns out the still small voice of the mighty God. . 
Peace used be the opposite of war, Conservative  used to mean the tendency 
to conserve resources. Liberal used to mean kind and generous, and Christian 
used to mean like Christ.

<p>So I am no longer a christian but just a person who continues trying to 
follow the example of Christ.
I’ll let him call me what he wants when I see him face to face.  Until then 
I will pray that some day  people like me will be able to reclaim the 
meaning of Christ’s identity and the world will see the effects of  the 
radical message of Christ‘s love- the perfect love that casts out fear.
