No country acts with a free conscience, without the memory of its past mistakes and the knowledge of what caused them. This is the imperfect world of international relations, and the reason that we seek to use institutions such as the EU and the UN to dissolve each nation's individual ability to make a mess of things. <P>But there comes a point in every nation's life when its people and their leaders have to admit to and atone for a mistake in order to be able to continue as a functioning part of the international community. That point has been reached for Britain on the first anniversary of the invasion of Iraq. WMD have not been found in Iraq and, whatever the modifications subsequently made to the casus belli by the prime minister and his publicly unabashed cabinet, that was incontrovertibly the reason we sent 12,000 troops to bomb and invade a sovereign territory.  <P>It's such a simple matter. Tony Blair was wrong. His cabinet was wrong not to oppose his policy on the evidence that he presented, and both the major parliamentary parties got it wrong - the Conservatives disastrously so for their ability to address the issue of the prime minister's trustworthiness in the run-up to the next election.  <P>The only people who emerge with credit from the period before March 20 last year are the Liberal Democrats and the million who marched against the war. Some were right for the wrong reasons but most, including the Lib Dems, instinctively made the better judgment in an intense and clouded debate that was all the more confusing for Bush and Blair's assertion that a pre-emptive strike was essential to all our security.  <P>Nothing could seem more silly in the wake of the Madrid bombs. Security in the west has not been improved by the Iraq war; in fact, the war has supplied al-Qaida with a brand new pretext for attacking the west, something that was widely predicted before the war and dismissed out of hand by the prime minister.  <P> This was no finely balanced political decision in which supporters on both sides could after the event claim equal moral rights in the matter. One group of people were wrong because they had not thought the many issues through, because they believed in America's distorted representations of itself and of its mission in the Middle East, and because they failed to distinguish between Saddam's regime and al-Qaida's network.  <P>By all means attack the men who would blow up innocent people, and pressure the regimes that support them, but never at any stage jettison the prized possession of any social democracy - the moral authority it brings. This was the first western casualty on March 20 2003, because we went to war on the false premise that Saddam was helping al-Qaida and possessed WMD that he could and would use at short notice.  <P>To admit this now is not to compromise our stand against al-Qaida but to strengthen our own democracy and sense of purpose in this new and frightening world. It is an expediency, as well as our duty, to confess the error. The moment we do, our relations with the UN, with moderate Arab states and with the European partners who opposed the war become a lot more honest and, one hopes, a little easier.  <P>Domestically it is important too, because Tony Blair's largely personal campaign to take us to war brushed aside checks and balances that we thought were integral to the system, and co-opted institutions of state that weren't sufficiently detached from his very presidential premiership. These are problems that will remain as long as Tony Blair is prime minister. But for the future, it's crucial to understand how his wishes prevailed when there was such a weight of opinion against his war.  <P>In Blair, the stealth bomber politician has won over the regular, church-going guy. As was evident in his speech in Sedgefield this month, he cannot and will not admit to his part in this profound error; nor to his enthrallment to the US, nor to his own vagueness and credulity about what does and does not work in the Middle East.  
<P>We cannot be the guardian of the prime minister's conscience. We can, however, decide who owns the truth. To deny his account that the Iraq war was simply one battlefield in the global struggle against terrorism is the first step we should take as a nation a year after the bombs fell. We owe it to the world and to ourselves.  <P>What follows afterwards is largely a matter for the parliamentary Labour party which, according to the Communicate Research poll yesterday, seems to be gradually registering a majority against the war. Eventually Labour MPs may decide that it is neither in the party's interest nor the country's to be represented by a man who cannot bring himself to acknowledge such an error.
