<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p>Okay, Democrats, here's how you win back the presidency in '08 ...

<P>Between now and the 2008 primaries, you promote the candidacy of one Hillary Rodham Clinton. You remember Hillary. She's the wife of William Jefferson Clinton, the pot-smoking, skirt-chasing, two-timer 42nd president of all the United States of America, including Ohio and Florida.

<P>Mrs. Clinton, the temp senator from New York, drives the conservatives nuts. She is, as her name implies, a female, and thus, in their eyes, uppity ... if she has the audacity to run for public office, which she does.

<P>Conservative men and women alike think that God created women only on the condition that they stay home, bake cookies and home-school the kids until Daddy earns enough to send them to Christian School.

<P>Mrs. Clinton ain't no cookie baker; she's made that clear. (Hey, Hillary, it's easy. Just 10 to 12 minutes in a 350-degree oven.) Thus, by conservative definition, she's an errant female to be scorned and reviled.

<P>So what I'm suggesting is the Democrats offer up Hillary as a target for conservative wrath over the next four years. Let the conservatives, the Republicans, the fascists -- all those people on the other side -- focus their venom on her. They already detest Hillary, so let them have at her.

<P>Then, at the last moment, pull a switcheroo. Thank Mrs. Clinton for her role as stalking horse, and then nominate a real liberal for president.

<P>It'll confuse the dickens out the Republicans. All their focus will be on the hated Hillary, but she'll suddenly be sitting on the sidelines snickering. Heck, she might even go home and bake up a batch of brownies. While she's doing that, the Republican elite -- Newt Gingrich, Bob Livingstone and their deep-pockets backers -- will be holding meetings with the Hollywood elite (Arnold Schwarzenegger, Charlton Heston and the ghost of Reagan) trying to figure out what to do next. How can you hit a target when the target isn't there anymore?

<P>Finding a true liberal to run for public office is difficult, but I have a suggestion that might help. First, have all the possible Democratic candidates vetted by the Democratic Leadership Council.

<P>The candidates approved by the DLC then should be offered million-dollar jobs with the National Association of Manufacturers, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce or other conservative front groups. Rest assured, none will refuse the money.

<P>The candidates deemed unfit by the DLC might actually be liberals. Keep them. Encourage them.

<P>If any candidate admits to being a member of a secret society at an Ivy League school (or Stanford), encourage him to marry a rich heiress, take up skiing and windsurfing, and retire from public life.


<P>And then the Democrats should pick as their nominee someone who appears to be as simple-minded as a game of Pong.

<P>That's to get the crossover votes.

<P>I say that because of the amazing e-mail I got from conservatives following the Nov. 2 election. It was as if all the writers dropped out of the same second grade. Their theme was: "We smart, you dumb."

<P>Remember Raymond, the Dustin Hoffman character from "Rain Man"? Oh, never mind!

<P>But clearly, if you judge by the e-mail I got, the Bush voters were enjoying their own version of "Revenge of the Nerds."

<P>They've always identified George W. Bush as one of their own. He's a "regular guy," in their book, somebody whose home is in a small town in Texas. His opponent was seen as an East Coast snob, a guy with homes everywhere.

<P>The issues were not particularly important to those conservatives. They wanted a leader they could trust, somebody who spoke their language, and they got one in George W. Bush.

<P>These are not deep thinkers, these Bush fans. Example: they think every male who lives in San Francisco is gay. Little do they realize that San Francisco has more illegal immigrants than gays. But do they think of San Francisco as Illegal Immigrant Town? Of course not.

<P>So why do they think of it as Queer Town? Easy. Those e-mailers won't understand this, I'm sure, but a good many of the straights in San Francisco would be just delighted if all the gays packed up and returned to Cincinnati or Omaha or Dallas or wherever they came from. It's true. San Franciscans are not happy to be identified as something they are not. What are San Franciscans? The most tolerant Americans in America.

<P>It's that tolerance that makes San Francisco what it is. That tolerance for those different than ourselves embodies the finest traditions of American democracy and diversity. But you can't take a picture of tolerance, so second-grade dropouts don't recognize or appreciate it.

<P>So, to review: Promote Hillary. Drop her at the last moment. Pick a true liberal. Pick someone who looks dumb.
