<p>I got a personalized e-mail from Laura Bush the other day.
<p> "Dear Steve," it began.
<p> "In a few days, I will join tens of thousands of the President's supporters in a live conference call. You can join this call by hosting a Party for the President on Thursday, July 15th."
<p> I checked my calendar. By chance, that day is wide open.
<p> I don't recall when the President's wife and I became pen pals, but it's been a while. In a separate e-mail last week, she mentioned "George" as if we were all bridge partners.
<p> "Thank you very much for all you have done and will do in this campaign," she wrote. "George and I really do appreciate it."
<p> I also got an e-mail from Bush's campaign manager calling me "a valued member of the President's team."
<p> Maybe they saw the column where I pointed out how wishy-washy John Kerry can be.
<p> Unfortunately, I don't have a spare $2,000 for Bush-Cheney '04 right now. As Mrs. Bush's party invitation pointed out, that's what they're after. But as Mrs. Bush noted, hosting a party is a contribution in itself.
<p> "One of the most important things you can do in this campaign," she wrote, "is talk to your friends and neighbors about the President's accomplishments and his leadership. Hosting a Party for the President makes neighbor-to-neighbor, person-to-person campaigning easy."
<p> I still wasn't sold. But then I reread an earlier Bush e-mail that informed me: "These parties are easy and fun."
<p> Huh. So they're easy.
<p> And fun.
<p> See George run.
<p> See Dick and George run.
<p> "Just ask Melanie Perry of Moss Bluff, Louisiana," the e-mail went on.
<p> "One guest really summed up how all of us felt," Melanie wrote.
<p> And what did that guest say?
<p> "The Bush-Cheney party was so nice yesterday!"
<p> How could I say no?
<p> Party at my house!
<p> But after going out to knock on doors in my neighborhood, I paused to consider Bush's "accomplishments and his leadership." His presidency is defined by the war in Iraq, and things have not gone swimmingly. I couldn't just knock on my neighbor's door and say, "Hey, Larry. Mission accomplished in Iraq. Kegger at my house."
<p> And Bush's better half, Vice President Dick Cheney, appears to have gone around the bend. I think he thumbs the phone book at night, calling ordinary people at random to insist there were long-established ties between Saddam Hussein and Al Qaeda.
<p> But unwavering gumption is the strength of Bush-Cheney, I realized, and it could be the theme for my party. Every time they're proven embarrassingly wrong, they become all the more insistent they were right. If that's not bold, what is?
<p> Think about it.
<p> There were no nukes. Saddam and Osama weren't in cahoots. One of the U.S.' favored replacements for Hussein was hooked up with Iranian spies. Iraq is now a training camp for terrorists. The blood flows in rivers, no end in sight.
<p> We've dumped $100 billion into a hole that grows deeper by the day. A bipartisan Senate committee called the justifications for war a giant crock, unleashing a screaming indictment of one of the greatest intelligence breakdowns in recorded history.
<p> And Laura wants me to throw a party.
<p> Leadership, chutzpah. Whatever you call it, we could all use a drink.
<p> The Tex-Mex is on me, friends. You bring the beer.
