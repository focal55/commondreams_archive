<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p>Michael Sommer, a technology consultant, found out the hard way about 
one-way fine print contracts as he checked in recently for a flight to 
Buenos Aires. A United Airlines supervisor at the gate handed him a 
letter that decreed the confiscation of his 2 million frequent flier 
miles, dozens of flight coupons and his elite status. United Airlines 
had audited his account, discovering violations of passenger program 
rules, which he denied so doing.

<p>Now, regardless of the violations alleged - such as misusing denied 
boarding certificates, is this unilateral wipeout the way to treat a 
loyal customer racking up over 2 million frequent miles? Especially when 
United Airlines is in bankruptcy and presumably wanting to make friends 
and influence people to use its services!

<p>Mr. Sommer's case led The New York Times to further inquiries which 
resulted in finding that some other airlines are conducting these 
tougher "audits" of their most loyal customers and making decisions from 
special software that looks for suspicious patterns. These include, the 
Times reports, "claiming miles for a nonrevenue ticket or using the 
wrong frequent-flier number when requesting mileage credit."

<p>The procedures are autocratic. Paul Dingham, an economic consultant, 
found out about his audit only after US Airways slammed down the gavel 
on him. "The airline didn't inform me in advance of the audit, nor did 
they offer me an opportunity to appeal," he complained.

<p>What these seasoned travelers discover is the fine print on most of 
these frequent flier programs declare that the miles to be owned by the 
airline and they can be diluted, deadlined or removed by the unbridled 
judgment of the carrier.

<p>Mr. Sommer may contest this assertion by United Airlines in court. Thus 
far, the courts have not been congenial to passengers when the airlines 
dilute the frequent flier program by requiring, for example, more miles, 
already earned, for a round trip.

<p>American consumers are fast losing their contractual rights in the 
service area of the economy. Fine print contracts, such as credit card 
agreements, brokerage agreements and insurance policy contracts, are 
very one-sided and getting worse each year. Have you ever read the 
shrink-wrap license agreement after you buy software?

<p>More and more of these standard/form take-it-or-leave-it contracts 
contain binding arbitration clauses that prevent you from suing vendors 
to resolve a dispute. They even contain the ultimate mockery of the 
meaning of the word "contract" as a mutually binding agreement. The 
large companies increasingly stipulate in microscopic print that they 
reserve the unilateral right to change the terms of their sales agreement.

<p>Well, you may say, you don't have to sign on the dotted line and can 
look for another competitor to patronize. Sure, but the competitor has 
the same fine print contract, whether General Motors or Ford, State Farm 
or Allstate, Citigroup or Bank of America.

<p>These big company standardized contracts regulate your relationship with 
the company. That fine print is enforceable in most courts. Judges 
rarely invalidate these provisions anymore under the doctrine of 
unconscionability. These giant corporations have become their own 
private legislatures. Perhaps someday anti-trust doctrine can be invoked 
if there is evidence of collusion by sellers to suppress competition in 
pre-printed contractual offerings.

<p>Meanwhile, the dotted line moves on to fiat after fiat, as in the recent 
proliferation of wholly unregulated stored value cards offered to 
millions of desperate "unbanked" consumers. The control of peoples' 
money by the financial industry not only gouges with sky-high interest 
rates and penalties. It also ranks your credit rating, and credit score 
in ways that deter your ability to complain and assigns you a number 
that determines where, how, when and whether you can or cannot buy.

<p>Congress and the state legislatures are way behind the curve in 
protecting consumers here. It is time for citizens to start giving these 
lawmakers a scorecard for being absent without leave of the voters, 
thereby leaving them defenseless before these modern day Mammons.
