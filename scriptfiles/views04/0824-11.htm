<p>American presidents beginning with George Washington have included 
religious language in their public addresses. Claims of the United States 
as a divinely chosen nation and requests for God to bless U.S. decisions 
and actions have been commonplace. Scholars have labeled such discourse 
"civil religion," in which political leaders emphasize religious symbols 
and transcendent principles to engender a sense of unity and shared 
national identity.

<p>George W. Bush is doing something altogether different.

<p>Since the attacks of Sept. 11, the president and his administration have 
converged a religious fundamentalist worldview with a political agenda -- a 
distinctly partisan one, wrapped in the mantle of national interest but 
crafted by and for only those who share their outlook. It is a modern form 
of political fundamentalism -- that is, the adaptation of a self-proclaimed 
conservative Christian rectitude, by way of strategic language choices and 
communication approaches designed for a mass-media culture, into political 
policy.

<p>Motivated by this ideology, the Bush administration has sought to control 
public discourse and to engender a climate of nationalism in which the 
public views presidential support as a patriotic duty and Congress (and the 
United Nations) is compelled to rubber-stamp administration policies.

<p>The goal is a national mood of spiritual superiority under the guise of a 
just sovereignty. The ultimate irony is that in combating the Islamic 
extremists responsible for Sept. 11, the administration has crafted, 
pursued and engendered its own brand of political fundamentalism -- one 
that, while clearly tailored to a modern democracy, nonetheless functions 
ideologically in a manner similar to the version offered by the terrorists.

<p>All of this has a facade of merely politics as usual. It is not. 
Unfortunately, as too often occurs with matters of religion, the mainstream 
news media have missed the story almost entirely, and thus so has much of 
the U.S. public.

<p>Bush is the most publicly religious president since at least Woodrow 
Wilson. Ronald Reagan had great appeal to religious conservatives, but he 
was far less outspoken about religion -- a point noted in a June eulogy of 
the late president by Ron Reagan, who said his father did not "(wear) his 
faith on his sleeve to gain political advantage," a comment many 
interpreted as a critique of the current president. Indeed, Bush speaks 
often about his "born-again" faith and regularly references a divine power 
in public statements, a practice that religion scholar Martin E. Marty has 
termed "God talk."

<p>That the president -- any president -- is a person of religious faith is 
generally viewed by the U.S. public in favorable terms, the better to be 
grounded when facing momentous decisions. I share this view because I know 
how central the Christian faith is to my life and to many others I know and 
respect. Invocations of a higher power, when emphasizing inclusive and 
transcendent principles, seem to me to be legitimate and adroit rhetoric 
for a leader of 290 million people, the overwhelming majority of whom 
believe in God in some form. What is deeply troubling about Bush's 
religiosity, however, is that he consistently evinces a certainty that he 
knows God's will -- and he then acts upon this certainty in ways that 
affect billions of humans.

<p>For example, in his address before Congress and a national television 
audience nine days after the terrorist attacks, Bush declared: "The course 
of this conflict is not known, yet its outcome is certain. Freedom and 
fear, justice and cruelty have always been at war, and we know that God is 
not neutral between them." Similarly, in the 2003 State of the Union 
address, with the conflict in Iraq imminent, he declared: "Americans are a 
free people, who know that freedom is the right of every person and the 
future of every nation. The liberty we prize is not America's gift to the 
world, it is God's gift to humanity." These are not requests for divine 
favor; they are declarations of divine wishes.

<p>From this position, only short theological and rhetorical steps are 
required to justify U.S. actions. For instance, at a December 2003 news 
conference, Bush said: "I believe, firmly believe -- and you've heard me 
say this a lot, and I say it a lot because I truly believe it -- that 
freedom is the Almighty God's gift to every person, every man and woman who 
lives in this world. That's what I believe. And the arrest of Saddam 
Hussein changed the equation in Iraq. Justice was being delivered to a man 
who defied that gift from the Almighty to the people of Iraq."

<p>Further, this view of divinely ordained policy infuses the public discourse 
of several administration leaders, irrespective of their particular 
religious outlook. I systematically examined hundreds of administration 
public communications -- by the president, John Ashcroft, Colin Powell and 
Donald Rumsfeld -- about the "war on terrorism" in the 20 months between 
Sept. 11, 2001, and the end of "major combat" in Iraq in spring 2003. This 
research showed that the administration's public communications contained 
four characteristics simultaneously rooted in religious fundamentalism 
while offering political capital:

<p>Simplistic, black-and-white conceptions of the political landscape, most 
notably good vs. evil and security vs. peril.

<p>Calls for immediate action on administration policies as a necessary part 
of the nation's "calling" and "mission" against terrorism.

<p>Declarations about the will of God for America and for the spread of U.S. 
conceptions of freedom and liberty.

<p>Claims that dissent from the administration is unpatriotic and a threat to 
the nation and globe.

<p>In combination, these characteristics have transformed Bush's "Either you 
are with us, or you are with the terrorists" policy to "Either you are with 
us, or you are against God." To the great misfortune of American democracy 
and the global public, such a view looks, sounds and feels remarkably 
similar to that of the terrorists it is fighting.

<p>Indeed, one is hard-pressed to see how the perspective of Osama bin Laden, 
that he and his followers are delivering God's wishes for the United States 
(and others who share Western customs and policies), is much different from 
the perspective of George W. Bush, that the United States is delivering 
God's wishes to the Taliban or Iraq. Clearly, flying airplanes into 
buildings in order to kill innocent people is an indefensible, immoral 
activity. So, too, some traditional allies told the Bush administration, is 
an unprovoked pre-emptive invasion of a sovereign nation. In both 
instances, the aggression manifested in a form that was available to the 
leaders. Fundamentalism in the White House is a difference in degree, not 
kind, from fundamentalism exercised in dark, damp caves. Democracy is 
always the loser.

<p>The ascendancy of the administration's political fundamentalism after Sept. 
11 was facilitated by mainstream U.S. news coverage, which substantially 
echoed the administration's views. That became apparent when I analyzed how 
20 leading and geographically diverse newspapers and the evening newscasts 
of ABC, CBS and NBC covered each of Bush's national addresses (15 in 20 
months, a remarkable pace) and the administration's push for key "war on 
terrorism" policies and goals in 2001 and 2002, including passage of the 
USA Patriot Act, the creation of the Department of Homeland Security and 
congressional and U.N. resolutions regarding Iraq.

<p>This analysis revealed that news media consistently amplified the words and 
ideas of the president and other administration leaders. They did that by 
echoing throughout their coverage similar claims made by multiple 
administration members, thereby having the administration's perspectives 
establish the terms of public discourse. For example, only two of more than 
300 editorials that I analyzed in response to the president's national 
addresses criticized the administration's description of the campaign 
against terrorism as an epic struggle of good vs. evil. None questioned his 
explicit declarations of God's will. With so many around the globe 
expressing a different view during these 20 months, by echoing these 
fundamentalist messages within these editorials, the press failed its readers.

<p>To be clear, the U.S. news media did not emphasize the administration's 
messages to the same extent as the White House did during this time. Such 
an equation would imply that the commercial, independent news media merely 
served as mouthpieces, and that is not the case. Disagreement with the 
administration sometimes appeared in news stories--either as a presentation 
of different factual information or of divergent observations by other 
sources -- and in newspaper editorials. Coverage also included occasional 
strong criticisms of government policy, in particular in regard to the 
administration's diplomatic difficulties in early 2003.

<p>The chief failure of members of the mainstream media, though, is that they 
did not adequately cover the deeply religious motivations to the 
administration's actions and, as a result, too rarely questioned the 
administration's religious-cum-political discourses. Once these 
fundamentalist discourses became consistently amplified -- but not analyzed 
-- in leading media outlets, the administration gained the rhetorical high 
ground, and that went far in determining policy decisions.

<p>While Christian conservatives and hard-line neo-conservatives may see the 
developments after Sept. 11 in a positive light (after all, one might say 
that God and the United States have been given a larger piece of the planet 
with which to work), all Americans should be leery of any government that 
merges religiosity into political ends. Noble ideals such as freedom and 
liberty are clearly worth pursuing, but the administration promoted those 
concepts with its left hand while using its right hand to treat others -- 
including many U.S. citizens -- in an authoritarian, dismissive manner. 
Unfortunately, the Bush administration appears to be the latest entry in a 
historical record that shows that beliefs and claims about divine leading 
are no guarantee that one will exercise power in a consistently liberating, 
egalitarian manner.
