<p>What a choice. We either defeat the terrorist religious fanatics, Tony Blair told his audience in Portugal yesterday, or we live under their climate of fear. Of course, we'd all rather defeat them, but this multi-headed hydra is proving very hard to find, let alone fight. It doesn't help that Britain and America have been squandering their efforts in the wrong country; the story being repeatedly told in America, including to the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks, is that George Bush's fixation with Iraq obstructed attempts to deal with al-Qaida. 
<p>So, a climate of fear it is. Everywhere you turn, there is another gray-faced public figure telling you that a major terrorist attack is coming. Blair has led the way himself, though admittedly he was talking about the dangers of world terrorism before the attacks on the World Trade Center. But he used tellingly biblical language in a recent speech: "September 11 was for me a revelation. What had seemed inchoate came together ... here were terrorists prepared to bring about armageddon." 

<p>From Bali to Madrid, the terror has indeed arrived. And ministers talk, privately and publicly, of their expectation that something equally dreadful is bound to happen in Britain before long. Senior intelligence people talk of "not if but when", and the police agree. Hear Sir John Stevens, the Met commissioner: "There is an inevitability that some sort of attack will get through ..." Hear Peter Hain, leader of the Commons: "Of course we are all frontline targets." Hear Superintendent Stuart Harrison, a British counter-terrorism expert who thinks there are already Sam 7 missiles in the UK with al-Qaida cells waiting to use them: "This is bigger than anything we have imagined before. We are in this for the long run: it will be 35 to 50 years before we get this cracked." Hear, again and again, David Blunkett: "This is a whole different ball game to anything we have been in before." 

<p>It sounds terrifying beyond words. And, beyond words, the campaign to alert and presumably terrify us continues. There are anti-bomb posters on the tube, and intelligence officers; sky marshals have been agreed for British aircraft; central London and the airports are awash with heavily armed police; flights have been cancelled and the army put on alert. A recent lorry spillage near Westminster saw the appearance of orange-suited chemicals experts, who looked as if they'd walked off the set of a sci-fi movie. If the intention is to make us feel that we are living in wartime, it's working. 

<p>The reaction to all this, I find, is anger. Rather than the stoicism of our parents' generation, there is fury. So where is the plucky Blitz spirit, the stiff upper lip that greeted the IRA bombings of the 70s and 80s? Well, firstly, comparisons of this kind are pretty academic - just as it doesn't much cheer today's poor to be told that in the 20s many children went barefoot. 

<p>Yet the underlying difference is nothing to do with people growing softer or less stoical. It is that we are being told that a major terrorist strike is inevitable, and there is nothing we can do except to trust our leaders. Above all, we must believe that the Iraq war has helped, not damaged, the fight against terrorism. It was an argument rejected by the Spanish electorate and it doesn't seem to be winning many converts in this country either. 

<p>The anger stems from the perception that we are at risk and that the threats to civil liberties, the likelihood of compulsory ID cards and the rest, are the price we pay for a policy we were not much in favor of to start with. It is an unstable proposition, which is why the political consequences of some awful attack in Britain are so hard to read. It could persuade people that Tony Blair was right all along, and should be trusted to see the war through; but it could have the opposite effect. (Charles Kennedy, keep on taking the Lucozade, your country may need you yet.) 

<p>But the politics of fear only begins with the obvious questions about Iraq, international terrorism and civil liberties. There is a wider issue still. Progressive politics generally does not thrive in a climate of fearfulness. It asks us to look outwards in a spirit of optimism, with our guard down - ready to trust and share with our fellow citizens. Whether the issue is income tax, the rights of prisoners in jails, asylum seekers, even constitutional changes, reform needs optimism. 

<p>And this, to say the least, is not an optimistic time. The fear expressed by so many politicians about terrorism is no doubt their attempt to avoid blame if the worst happens, as well as a justified and timely warning of a genuine danger. But they need to ask themselves how people will react more generally to the political climate they are creating. Will it make us more or less likely to trust officialdom, to share, to take risks, to give the government the benefit of the doubt? Is the very politics of the war against terror, so oddly interwoven round the war against Iraq, actually undermining Labour's chances of further reform at home? 

<p>What about our multi-ethnic society, with its religious tolerance and its liberal traditions? What about our legal safeguards and our welfare consensus? What about the promise of renewed, busier cities and freer-feeling people? 

<p>Much of what Jack Straw said this week about the hopelessness of shrinking back into insular isolation was quite right. This cannot be seen as a "clash of civilizations". Clearly, the values of a liberal, pluralist democracy, with respect for human rights and equality for women, are not shared by some Islamic extremists. But standing for our values is a lot harder if the entire political and policing establishment spends so much time convincing us that we face a threat that is not only massive and almost endless, but against which citizens cannot shield themselves. 

<p>It is a hard balance to get right, because the state clearly has a duty to tell us the truth. But there is a hidden contradiction in the government's message that I think voters are beginning to spot. If the war against Iraq was a necessary part of the war against terrorism then things should be getting better, not worse. If Blair was right not to pile the pressure on Israel, as other Europeans wanted to do, but to line up shoulder to shoulder with the Bush agenda, then why is the Middle East becoming more dangerous and unstable? In short, if we are trusting our leaders to do it right, then why is it going so badly? Where is the analysis that leads towards a better future? 

<p>We are certainly not the first generation to live under a climate of fear, as the prime minister is always eager to remind us. But in comparing himself to his great predecessor, Winston Churchill, there is one thing he should remember. Churchill did not simply offer people blood, sweat and tears. He offered them hope too. <p ALIGN="CENTER">&copy; Guardian Newspapers Limited 2004<p align="center">###</p><!-- #EndEditable --></font></td></tr>
