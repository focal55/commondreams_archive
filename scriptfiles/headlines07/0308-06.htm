<p> Campaigners
have condemned the Bush administration's plan to proceed with secret
proceedings against 14 "high-value" terrorism suspects currently being
held at Guantanamo Bay. The suspects include Khalid Sheikh Mohammed,
accused of organising the 11 September 2001 attacks. <p>

The military tribunals, scheduled to begin tomorrow, will take place behind 
  closed doors and away from the scrutiny of the media. Hundreds of previous 
  hearings held to determine the formal status of the prisoners have been open 
  to reporters. None of the suspects will be able to have a lawyer present.
</p>
<p>
  The Pentagon has said that the so-called Combatant Status Review Tribunals 
  (CSRT) are being held in secret to prevent the possible leaking of 
  classified information. But legal campaigners said the decision had been 
  taken to prevent the revelation of information embarrassing to the Bush 
  administration.
</p>
<p>

  "They're not going to let anybody close," said Clive Stafford 
  Smith, of the UK-based group Reprieve, which represents several dozen 
  Guantanamo prisoners, though none of the 14. "They are trying to stop 
  anyone saying anything about the way they have been abused or which 
  countries they were abused in."
</p>
<p>
  The 14 men - three Pakistanis, two Yemenis, two Saudis, two Malaysians, a 
  Palestinian, a Libyan, a Somali, an Indonesian and a Tanzanian - were 
  transferred to Guantanamo Bay last September from secret US "black site"
 facilities around the world. At the time of their transfer, Mr Bush claimed: "
These are dangerous men, with unparalleled knowledge about terrorist networks 
  and their plans of new attacks. The security of our nation and the lives of 
  our citizens depend on our ability to learn what these terrorists know."
</p>
<p>
  In addition to Mr Mohammed, the prisoners include two other alleged senior 
  al-Qa'ida figures - Abu Zubaydah and Ramzi Binalshibh. Mr Mohammed was 
  described in the official US investigation into the September 11 attacks as 
  their "principal architect" and is also accused of involvement in 
  the murder of the journalist Daniel Pearl.
</p>
<p>
  But campaigners insist that without a fair trial and access to lawyers it is 
  impossible to assess what the men may or may not be guilty of. Wells Dixon, 
  a lawyer with the New York-based Centre for Constitutional Rights, which 
  represents one of the men due to go before a CSRT, Majid Khan, said: "
  This is a system designed to obtain a pre-determined result."
</p>
<p>
  Mr Dixon said that Mr Bush had admitted the 14 men had been subjected to "
enhanced interrogation" techniques which he said was a euphemism for 
  torture. He added that under the CSRT rules the government could use 
  information obtained under torture. He added: "You don't know what is 
  true until you have given them a fair trial."

</p>
<p>
  Mr Khan, 26, who was living in Baltimore, travelled to Pakistan in 2002 and 
  was seized by the authorities a year later. The US has accused Mr Khan of 
  having links to Mr Mohammed but his father last year told The Washington 
  Post: "He's a terrorist, my son? No. I don't accept this."
</p>
<p>
  The Pentagon has said that transcripts of the proceedings will be made 
  available though they will be edited to remove information it deemed "
  dangerous to national security". Spokesman Bryan Whitman said: "
  [Security concerns exist] given the nature of these individuals and the 
  information that will be necessary as a part of these combatant status 
  review tribunals."
</p>
<p>
  The hearings are part of a process established by the Bush administration as 
  a means of complying with a provision of the Geneva Conventions that 
  requires a prisoner's status to be assessed by a "competent tribunal"
. Many campaigners argue that the CSRTs, involving a panel of three military 
  officers and a government-provided representative, do not constitute a 
  competent tribunal.
</p>
<p>
  It was originally assumed the hearings would be open to the media, providing 
  the first public appearance of Mr Mohammed and the other prisoners since 
  before their arrests. The only independent visitors to have seen the men are 
  observers from the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). An ICRC 
  spokesman, Simon Schorno, said the organisation was bound not to speak about 
  the circumstances of the individuals, but added: "We don't believe 
  there is an appropriate legal framework for these detentions. The lack of a 
  clear legal framework has clearly had an impact on [the prisoners'] mental 
  health."
</p>

<p>
  Campaigners have long been fighting for the prisoners to be brought to trial 
  or else released. They appeared to have won a victory last summer when the 
  Supreme Court ruled that they had the right to challenge their detention. 
  However, the Bush administration passed new legislation to circumvent the 
  ruling.
</p>
<p>
  There are currently 385 prisoners being held at Guantanamo, around 80 of 
  whom have been cleared for release. While Mr Bush says he would like to 
  close the prison his administration pushed ahead with the building of a $30m 
  (£15.5m) maximum-security prison block, Camp 6, which opened last autumn. 
  Just 10 prisoners have been formally charged.
</p>
<p>
  <b>The main suspects 
</b></p>
<p>
  <b>Khalid Sheikh Mohammed </b>
</p>

<p>
  Allegedly al-Qai'da's number three, Mohammed is accused of being the 
  architect behind the September 11 attacks. A playboy and a committed 
  jihadist, he has been in US custody since 2003. Raised in Kuwait, the US 
  says he was involved in the 2002 Bali bomb attacks and the murder of the US 
  journalist Dan Pearl.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Ramzi Binalshibh </b>
</p>
<p>
  The nephew of Khaled Sheikh Mohammed is also regarded as one of the key 
  plotters of the September 11 attacks. A former bank clerk from Yemen, he was 
  the first person to be publicly identified as the "20th hijacker". 
  He shared a room with the hijacker leader Muhammad Atta in Germany and was 
  apprehended in Pakistan in 2002.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Abu Zubaydah </b>

</p>
<p>
  Already sentenced to death in absentia in Jordan, Zubaydah was allegedly one 
  of Osma bin Laden's key lieutenants and al-Qa'ida's chief of operations in 
  the late 90s. A Saudi national, Zubaydah has been implicated in the planning 
  of numerous terrorist plots, including the 2000 attack on the USS Cole. He 
  was captured in Pakistan in 2002.<p align="center" class="ap-story-p"> &copy; 2007 Independent News and Media Limited <br>
