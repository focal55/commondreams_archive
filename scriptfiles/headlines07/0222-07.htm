<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p> If, as she insists, Secretary of State 
Condoleezza Rice is determined to make concrete progress toward achieving 
George W. Bush's vision of a two-state solution, one in which Israel would 
be required to make major territorial concessions, it appears that she 
faces a major foe in the White House.
<br>
<b><br>
</b>No, not only Dick Cheney and the surviving members of the neo-conservative 
clique that surrounded him and former Pentagon chief Donald Rumsfeld 
during Bush's first term -- although the vice president's office remains a 
formidable force against any concessions to a Palestinian government of 
national unity that includes Hamas, despite Saudi Arabia's role in 
midwifing its birth at Mecca last week.
<br>
<br>
Rather, it appears that Rice's own chief Middle East aide when she served 
as Bush's national security adviser, Elliott Abrams, has become the 
principal foil in frustrating her efforts to resume a peace process. Until 
her meeting in Jerusalem last weekend with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud 
Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, the process had been 
frozen since the last days of Bill Clinton's administration.
<br>
<br>
Abrams' personal influence over Bush could not possibly match Rice's, but 
his bureaucratic skills and political connections -- notably to the 
so-called "Israel Lobby" of pro-Likud Jewish organisations and the 
Christian Right -- give him considerable clout. According to various 
sources, Abrams has been working systematically to undermine any prospect 
for serious negotiations designed to give substance to Rice's hopes -- and 
increasingly impatient demands by Saudi King Abdullah -- of offering the 
Palestinians a "political horizon" for a final settlement. <br>
<br>
"The Bush administration has done nothing to press Israel to deliver on 
its commitments, beyond Washington's empty rhetoric about a two-state 
'political horizon'," Henry Siegman, the long-time director of the 
U.S./Middle East Project at the influential Council on Foreign Relations, 
wrote in the International Herald Tribune just last week. <br>
<br>
"Every time there emerged the slightest hint that the United States may 
finally engage seriously in a political process, Elliott Abrams would meet 
secretly with Olmert's envoys in Europe or elsewhere to reassure them that 
there exists no such danger," he complained. <br>
<br>
After the resignation of Cheney's former chief of staff, I. Lewis Libby, 
and the departure from the Pentagon nearly two years ago of Paul Wolfowitz 
and Douglas Feith, Abrams became the administration's most influential 
neo-conservative, particularly regarding Middle East policy which he 
oversees as Deputy National Security Adviser for Global Democracy 
Strategy.
<br>
<br>
Abrams was an early protégé of Richard Perle, whom he first met, along 
with other prominent pro-Likud hard-liners, such as Feith, former U.N. 
Amb. Jeane Kirpatrick, and Weekly Standard editor William Kristol, while 
working in the offices of Washington State Sen. Henry "Scoop" Jackson. 
Abrams rose swiftly through the neo-conservative ranks, even becoming a 
member of one of its most influential families as the son-in-law of the 
legendary editor of Commentary, Norman Podhoretz, and his activist wife, 
Midge Decter, who herself published a hagiography of Rumsfeld just after 
the Iraq invasion. <br>
<br>
Like his fellow-neo-cons, Abrams has never trusted "peace processes", and 
not just between Israel and its Arab neighbours. During the mid-1980s, 
when he served as the top Latin America policy-maker in Ronald Reagan's 
State Department, he worked doggedly to scuttle all regional diplomatic 
efforts to stop not only Washington's "contra war" against Nicaragua's 
Sandinista government (which, among other things, he charged with 
anti-Semitism) and the civil war in El Salvador, but even in southern 
Africa, where Cuban troops helped defend Angola against attacks by South 
Africa and its proxies. <br>
<br>
"He opposed regional peace talks, he opposed bilateral talks between the 
United States and Nicaragua, and he opposed talks with Cuba," according to 
William LeoGrande, dean of American University's School of Public Affairs 
and author of "In Our Backyard", a magisterial work on U.S. Central 
America policy. <br>
<br>
"He wouldn't negotiate with adversaries, even when negotiations promised 
to safeguard U.S. interests," LeoGrande told IPS, citing the eventual deal 
that resulted in Cuba's withdrawal from Africa in exchange for Namibian 
independence. "He insisted on total victory, as if foreign policy were a 
moral crusade in which compromise was anathema."
<br>
<br>
Badly damaged by his felony conviction for lying to Congress about his 
role in the Iran-Contra affair, Abrams, like many neo-cons, left 
government service under the decidedly "realist" administration of 
President George H.W. Bush and spent the 1990s at various think tanks. 
There, he helped forge the coalition -- epitomised by Kristol's Project 
for the New American Century (PNAC) of which he was a charter member -- of 
mainly Jewish neo-conservatives, the Christian and Catholic Right, and 
aggressive nationalists that would seize control of U.S. policy after 
9/11. <br>
<br>
On the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, Abrams has long been identified with 
his hard-line patrons, such as Perle and Podhoretz, who have strongly 
opposed the "land-for-peace" formula that, until the younger Bush, had 
been official U.S. policy since 1967. <br>
<br>
When the elder Bush pressed Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir to 
participate in the Madrid peace conference after the first Gulf War, 
Abrams and dozens of other neo-conservatives organised the Committee on 
U.S. Interests in the Middle East to lobby against such an effort.
<br>
<br>
Throughout the 1990s, Abrams denounced the Oslo peace process in the 
strongest terms -- a Likud government was engaged in it. When Palestinians 
launched the second intifada in September 2000, he lambasted mainstream 
U.S. Jewish groups for their continued support for peace talks between 
Israel and the PA as "self-delusion". "The Palestinian leadership," he 
wrote, "does not want peace with Israel, and there will be no peace..."
<br>
<br>
Politically unable, due to his Iran-Contra conviction, to gain Senate 
confirmation to a State Department or Pentagon post, Abrams entered the 
younger Bush administration as a National Security Council (NSC) staffer 
under Rice in 2001 with responsibility for democracy promotion. But in a 
major coup that set off celebrations in Rumsfeld's and Cheney's offices, 
he was given the Middle East portfolio in December 2002.
<br>
<br>
In that capacity, he forged close ties to Dov Weisglass and Shalom 
Turgeman, two of Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's top aides. Together, the 
three men established a direct channel between Sharon's office and Rice's 
NSC that effectively excluded Secretary of State Colin Powell, the 
administration's strongest advocate for resuming an Israeli-Palestinian 
peace process.
<br>
<br>
The same channel was used to line up Bush's support for Sharon's 
unilateral disengagement from Gaza, a scheme designed in part to pre-empt 
growing pressure from Washington's European and Arab allies to get a 
credible peace process underway -- this time in the form of the 
long-delayed "Road Map" sponsored by the Quartet (the U.S., the European 
Union, the U.N., and Russia) -- as Washington's position in Iraq 
deteriorated in 2004 and 2005. <br>
<br>
Sharon's disengagement plan, as well as his departure from Likud to form 
the more centrist Kadima Party, was opposed by U.S. Christian Right 
leaders and most hard-line neo-conservatives, including Perle, who had 
long been among Abrams' closest associates. But Abrams himself, apparently 
persuaded by Weisglass' argument that such a pre-emptive move would gain 
Israel time to consolidate its position on the West Bank and create a 
precedent for imposing a final border unilaterally, strongly defended the 
move.
<br>
<br>
Rice thought so highly of Abrams' effectiveness that she considered 
appointing him deputy secretary of state when she moved over to the State 
Department in early 2005. But Bush's political advisers said his 
appointment would set off a major and costly confirmation battle and 
instead suggested that he be promoted to deputy national security adviser.
<br>
<br>
Signs of a serious breach between the two, however, surfaced during the 
first days of last summer's Israel-Hezbollah conflict.

<br>
<br>
Rice reportedly favoured a request by Olmert for Washington to discreetly 
contact Syrian President Bashar Assad about securing the release of two 
Israeli soldiers captured by the Lebanese group. Abrams not only strongly 
opposed such a move, but in a meeting with a "very senior Israeli 
official" in Jerusalem within 48 hours of the outbreak of hostilities, 
also suggested that Washington would have no objection if Israel extended 
its military offensive from Lebanon to Syria, a well-informed source who 
received an account of the meeting from one of its participants told IPS. <br>
<br>
Abram's advice echoed similar appeals by neo-conservatives, including 
Kristol, Perle and his colleagues at the American Enterprise Institute 
(AEI), such as David Frum, Newt Gingrich, and Danielle Pletka, who 
repeatedly attacked Olmert for timidity in the conduct of the war and 
urged the administration to reject growing pressure from Washington's 
European and Arab allies to bring the war to an end. Rice herself became a 
target of neo-conservative attacks as it became clear that she was 
relaying that pressure to Bush directly.
<br>
<br>
According to the New York Times, Abrams, who accompanied Rice on all of 
her trips to the region throughout the crisis, "...kept in direct contact 
with Mr. Cheney's office", the last stronghold of neo-conservatives, 
notably the vice president's national security adviser, John Hannah and 
his Middle East adviser, David Wurmser. <br>
<br>
That breach has, by most accounts, only become wider since the war's end, 
as Rice has become increasingly sensitised to the depth of anger in the 
Arab world directed against both the U.S. and Israel. She is acutely aware 
of the impatience of Washington's Quartet partners to leapfrog the Road 
Map and move toward "final status" negotiations, as well as the difficulty 
in rallying the pro-U.S. Arab states against Iran in the absence of a 
credible Israeli-Palestinian peace process. <br>
<br>
It is in that context that Rice has been pushing for resuming a peace 
process that could, at the very least, offer the Palestinians a "political 
horizon" for a final settlement involving large territorial concessions by 
Israel. She has reportedly even reviewed the hypothetical peace settlement 
negotiated informally in 2003 by Israeli and Palestinian politicians and 
retired military and intelligence officials, known as the Geneva 
Initiative. <br>
<br>
She has reportedly been encouraged by some in the Israeli government, 
notably Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni, perhaps Olmert's most serious 
political rival within the Kadima party.
<br>
<br>
But, as in the Israel-Hezbollah war, Rice is up against a formidable 
adversary in Abrams and his confederates in the vice president's office 
who appear once again to have established their own direct line to Olmert, 
this time through Turgeman and another top adviser, Yoram Turbowicz.
<br>
<br>
It was that channel that was in play last Friday, on the eve of the 
Jerusalem talks, when Olmert held a personal telephone conversation with 
Bush and emerged claiming that the U.S. president had promised to boycott 
any new Palestinian government of national unity that includes Hamas so 
long as the Islamist party does not explicitly recognise Israel, renounce 
violence, and pledge to abide by existing agreements between the Palestine 
Liberation Organisation (PLO).
<br>
<br>
"The American and Israeli positions are totally identical," Olmert 
declared, essentially rejecting what had been worked out in Mecca just a 
few days before and dooming whatever hopes Rice had for a productive 
summit Sunday that could provide the effort with some positive momentum 
that she could report to the Quartet meeting in Berlin Wednesday. <br>
<br>
"For the first time in six years, the secretary of state seems to be 
committed to moving this process forward," said Martin Indyk, director of 
the Brookings Institution's Saban Centre for Middle East Policy and a 
former top policymaker under Clinton, last week before the meetings. "But 
there are others in the administration who want to 'Powellize' her," he 
added in a thinly veiled reference to Abrams and his allies. <br>
<br>
Indeed, Abrams and his friends in recent days have appeared to be 
broadening their attack on Rice. In an email he fired off to his East Asia 
colleagues and that was subsequently leaked to the Washington Post, he 
complained about last week's agreement with North Korea in the "Six-Party 
Talks" in Beijing, a complaint that has been quickly picked up by other 
neo-conservatives. <br>
<br>
Abrams had been "frustrated because so many key decisions had been made at 
the highest levels without much vetting by officials scattered across the 
government," according to the Post's sources -- a charge echoed with some 
vehemence by other allies, including Frum and former U.N. Amb. John 
Bolton. <br>
<br>
"The deal reveals a breakdown of the administration's decision-making 
process," Frum wrote this week, citing a Times report that Rice had 
"bypassed layers of government policy review that had derailed past 
efforts to negotiate an agreement."
<br>
<br>
The complaint was a particularly ironic one in light of Abrams' role with 
the Iran-Contra scandal, his own use of back channels, and his efforts, 
along with Cheney's and Rumsfeld's offices, to exclude the State 
Department and Central Intelligence Agency, during Bush's first term.
