<p>As one of the founders of the Out of Iraq Caucus, along with
California Democratic Reps. Barbara Lee and Lynn Woolsey, I have been
persistent and unrelenting in my efforts to bring pressure on the U.S.
House of Representatives to vote to fully fund our safe and secure
withdrawal from Iraq. 
<p>Not
only did the American public speak loudly and clearly last Nov. 7, but
poll after poll reinforces the message that Americans want their troops
home now. The president's supplemental request is just what the word "supplemental" implies — additional funds to expand and continue this
war. I believe that there is enough money available in the pipeline to
fund a planned exit. I will vote against the supplemental unless the
additional funds are used to fully fund the safe, secure and timely
withdrawal of our troops by Dec. 31. </p>
<p>Our soldiers are being killed every day. So far this week,
12 U.S. troops have been killed, which brings the total to almost 3,200
dead and more than 24,000 injured. My greatest fear is that we will all
awaken one morning to the news that hundreds or maybe even thousands
have been killed in a massive attack. Contrary to the rhetoric of
President Bush and his administration, we were not welcomed in Iraq
with open arms. Rather, we were seen as occupiers by the Sunnis,
Shiites and the Kurds alike. Day after day, from Fallujah to Sadr City,
our troops are placed in the midst of a civil war that cannot be
contained by American forces. </p>

<p>While the president is determined to continue this war and has
adopted the "cut and run" sound bite to intimidate those of us who
disagree with him, the American people are demanding leadership, not
safe political nuances by politicians who believe they can have it both
ways. Democrats can no longer afford to create the perception that we
are against this war without taking meaningful action. The vote on the
president's supplemental appropriation is an opportunity for this
Congress to prove that members have heard the voices of the American
people who want a fully funded safe, secure and timely withdrawal of
our troops from Iraq.
