<p> SAO PAULO, Brazil - When President Bush lands in the
Uruguayan capital of Montevideo Friday night as part of his seven-day
Latin American tour, leftist Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, a fierce
Bush critic, will be on the attack just across the river in Argentina.

Chavez is scheduled to speak to tens of thousands of anti-Bush
protesters in the Argentine capital of Buenos Aires, and he'll do it
with the blessing of Argentine President Nestor Kirchner. In fact,
Kirchner's aides are helping to organize the rally.
</p><p>Kirchner won't attend the rally, but his hosting of Chavez
signals a decisive step away from the United States and toward the
Venezuelan's confrontational, anti-free markets vision.
</p><p>Kirchner previously had been known as a more pragmatic leftist
politician somewhere between Chavez and center-left Brazilian President
Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva.
</p><p>"Up to this point, Kirchner has been playing a very ambiguous
game," said Alvaro Vargas Llosa, a U.S.-based Latin American analyst.
"The significance of what is happening on Friday is Kirchner is moving
more decisively toward Chavez and away from other, more moderate
left-wing governments in the region."
</p><p>Kirchner has been building up to the move for the past month.
On Feb. 21, while joining Chavez in Venezuela to inaugurate an oil well
to be run by Venezuela and Argentina, Kirchner boldly defended Chavez,
who's been accused of seeking dictatorial powers in his country.
</p><p>"Much has been said lately about how there are countries that
should contain other countries, as in the case of President Lula or of
us, that we must contain President Chavez," Kirchner said. "Absolute
error. We are building with brother President Chavez space in South
America for the happiness of our people."

</p><p>Chavez, who regularly calls Bush "the devil," thanked Kirchner
for defending him from "those who surrendered to North American
imperialism and permitted the plunder of the homeland."
</p><p>The ties haven't just been rhetorical. Controlling one of the
world's biggest oil reserves, Chavez has showered petrodollars on
Argentina, agreeing at last month's meeting to buy $750 million in
Argentine bonds and bringing Venezuela's total holdings of Argentine
debt to $3.5 billion.
</p><p>The two countries also have launched a Latin American
development bank that they hope will replace more traditional lenders
such as the International Monetary Fund.
</p><p>With October presidential elections approaching in Argentina,
the closer Chavez ties could also bring political benefits to Kirchner,
although he hasn't yet announced whether he or his wife, Sen. Cristina
Fernandez de Kirchner, will run for the top office.
</p><p>A Latinobarometro poll of more than 20,000 people around Latin
America conducted last year found that only Venezuelans and Dominicans
supported Chavez more than Argentines. At the same time, Bush received
his lowest approval rating in the region from Argentines.
</p><p></p><p>"Being anti-Bush and using Chavez as a decoy has worked so far
for Kirchner, so he'll keep using the strategy," said Argentine analyst
Felipe Noguera. "He's actually running a government that's fairly
conservative in some areas, so I think his Chavista rhetoric is for the
gallery."
</p><p>Activist Jorge Ceballos, a deputy secretary in Kirchner's
social development ministry, said that the Argentine president wasn't
faking his rhetoric and that his role in Friday's rally proved it.
</p><p>Ceballos and other pro-Kirchner activists are organizing the
event along with the human rights group Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo.
Bolivian President Evo Morales and Ecuadorian President Rafael Correa,
both Chavez allies, were invited but aren't expected to attend.
</p><p>"Kirchner showed in Venezuela that he is going to defend our
countries from North American imperialist interference," Ceballos said.
"This rally is a response that promises to unify our region."
