His father, Jamil, is one of eight British residents languishing among the 
  almost 400 inmates at the American base at Guantanamo Bay, which opened five 
  years ago to the day this Thursday - the day of Anas's protest.
</p>
<p>
  Mr Banna, was taken to Guantanamo Bay four years ago after being seized in 
  Gambia along with fellow detainee Bisher al-Rawi. He was accused of having a 
  suspicious device in his luggage. It turned out to be a battery charger. No 
  charges have been made.
</p>
<p>
  He suffers from severe diabetes, but his lawyers say he has not been offered 
  medication and has been denied the food he needs. His eyesight is now 
  failing.

</p>
<p>
  A year ago, his son wrote to Tony Blair for the second time to ask why the 
  Government was not helping him return home. The then six-year-old did not 
  even receive a reply. The second letter elicited a cursory note from the 
  Foreign Office. It stated that because Mr Banna is not a British citizen, 
  although his wife and children are, nothing could be done for him.
</p>
<p>
  So on Thursday, carrying yet another letter, Anas and his mother Sabah will 
  return with campaigners and MPs to demand the closure of the camp and action 
  to free the British residents.
</p>
<p>
  Their MP, the the Liberal Democrat frontbencher Sarah Teather, said the 
  Banna children, who are of Jordanian origin but have grown up in North 
  London, were devastated by their father's detention.
</p>
<p>
  The Downing Street protest will come during a week of action to mark the 
  fifth anniversary of Guantanamo Bay. Since its inception, the camp has drawn 
  furious protests from across the globe. Last night, Ian McCartney, the 
  Foreign Office minister, faced anger on the floor of the House of Commons as 
  the MPs for Mr Banna and another detainee, Bisher al-Rawi, lambasted the 
  Government.
</p>

<p>
  Today Ms Teather will present a petition to Parliament demanding his 
  release, while tomorrow, relatives and friends will hold a candlelit vigil 
  outside Downing Street.
</p>
<p>
  Hundreds of protesters dressed in the notorious orange boiler suits that are 
  the uniform at Guantanamo, plan a separate protest outside the US Embassy.
</p>
<p>
  Peace activist Cindy Sheehan is among a group of US activists that has 
  travelled to Cuba to protest outside the camp, on the Cuban side. With them 
  will be former inmate Asif Iqbal, one of the Tipton Three, who was released 
  without charge in March 2004.
</p>
<p>
  Many of the British residents have families who are British citizens, and 
  had leave to remain in the UK, but the Government has refused to take 
  responsibility for them. Yesterday, Ed Davey, chief of staff to the Liberal 
  Democrat leader Sir Menzies Campbell, used the Commons debate to attack 
  ministers for allowing British residents to "languish" in the camp.
</p>
<p>

  He said: "The Government has been both hypocritical and morally 
  bankrupt. They have condemned Guantanamo Bay but have failed to take action 
  for the British residents." He said the US administration had offered 
  to send the men home, but the UK had refused to accept them. He added: "
   The Prime Minister should stop talking about closing Guantanamo and start 
  doing something about it."
</p>
<p>
  Human rights lawyer Zachary Katznelson, senior advocate at the charity 
  Reprieve, represents the eight men. He said several were held in solitary 
  confinement, some in cells that were lit 24 hours a day. He added: "If 
  they have committed any crime, of course they should be prosecuted and 
  punished. But I have not seen evidence that they have. If it's there, let's 
  see it."
</p>
<p>
  The Foreign Office said it had agreed to make special representations on 
  behalf of Bisher al-Rawi, but insisted that the courts had found that the 
  Government had "no locus" to intervene of behalf of the other men.
</p>
<p>
  On Thursday, Anas el-Banna will try, for the third time, to persuade them to 
  change their minds.
