<p>US President George W. Bush's planned new strategy for Iraq came under fire anew in Arab states of the Gulf, among Washington's staunchest regional allies.</p>
<p>


Newspapers in the region also voiced scepticism and even derision over US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice's Middle East tour aimed at reviving the Israel-Palestinian peace process and rallying support for Bush's Iraq plan.</p>
<p>

Qatari Foreign Minister Sheikh Hamad bin Jassem bin Jabr al-Thani chastised Washington for failing to consult the Gulf Cooperation Council of which it is a member over its &quot;harmful&quot; Iraq policy.</p>
<p>

&quot;I think it's important for American friends to coordinate their policies with countries in the region ... before adopting them,&quot; he said</p>

<p>

&quot;The region's countries will be the first to be affected by their policies,&quot; he said in Doha at a press conference with his Italian counterpart Massimo D'Alema. &quot;Those policies that led to this situation have harmed the region.&quot;</p>
<p>
Bush announced last week he was planning to send an extra 21,500 troops to Iraq to stem unprecedented bloodshed in the country while pressing the Iraqi government to boost its own security efforts.</p>
<p>

But the plan has come under a barrage of criticism at home and abroad and was greeted with only a lukewarm response from Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki.</p>
<p>

&quot;The American administration has no right to ask Iraqis and other countries of the region to follow its strategy... when the administration itself is incapable of convincing even Americans of this policy,&quot; wrote the Saudi newspaper Okaz.</p>

<p>

Opinion polls in the United States have shown that nearly two-thirds of Americans disapprove of the Bush plan.</p>
<p>

&quot;A good number of observers do not expect the new American strategy to succeed in improving the situation in Iraq. On the contrary, they believe that it will lead to more chaos, more terrorist acts and more victims,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>

The US government should &quot;first of all convince its own people about the strategy before trying to convince the world.&quot;</p>
<p>

Fellow Saudi newspaper Al-Madina said it hoped Rice's tour would at least lead to the dismantling of the militias and death squads behind much of the bloodshed in Iraq.</p>
<p>

In the United Arab Emirates, the headline on the Al-Khaleej mocked: &quot;Rice comes... as a tourist.&quot;</p>
<p>

&quot;If Rice has come only to listen, it's a mixture of sarcasm and provocation. Rice knows only too well the positions of the countries she is visiting and doesn't need to listen further.&quot;</p>
<p>

&quot;And even after listening and understanding what others want, will she take that on board?&quot; the paper asked.</p>

<p>

In Jordan, another key US regional ally, the independent Al-Arab Al-Yawm also dismissed the chance of Rice winning support for Bush's plans for Iraq, currently governed by a Shiite-led coalition.</p>
<p>

&quot;Rice is not expected to be successful in promoting Bush's strategy. When the secretary of state asks moderate Arab countries to support the Maliki government, she is in fact asking them to support Iran's influence in Iraq.&quot;</p>
