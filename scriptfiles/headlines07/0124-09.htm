The nation's top prosecutor has set himself at odds with Prime Minister Tony Blair's government, saying the &quot;war on terror&quot; does not exist and urging restraint on laws threatening human rights.

The director of public prosecutions, Ken Macdonald, warned Wednesday of a &quot;fear-driven and inappropriate response&quot; to the new threat that could lead to the abandonment of respect for fair trials and due legal process.</p>
<p>

In a speech to the Criminal Bar Association, reported by the Guardian newspaper, Macdonald rejected the assertion that a &quot;war on terror&quot; was being played out in Britain.</p>

<p>

&quot;On the streets of London, there is no such thing as a 'war on terror', just as there can be no such thing as a 'war on drugs', said Macdonald, who heads the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS).</p>
<p>

&quot;The fight against terrorism on the streets of Britain is not a war. It is the prevention of crime, the enforcement of our laws and the winning of justice for those damaged by the infringement.&quot;</p>
<p>

One of the primary aims of groups and invididuals who committed atrocities such as the July 2005 suicide bombings in London was to encourage a response that ran counter to British values, he added.</p>
<p>

Since the bombings -- and even after the September 11, 2001 attacks in the United States -- there have been criticisms that anti-terrorism legislation unfairly targets British Muslims.</p>
<p>

Blair has tried -- and failed -- to increase the maximum period of detention without charge for security suspects to 90 days, while detention without trial -- the government's response to September 11 -- was ruled unlawful.</p>
<p>

The courts have also criticised an alternative system of &quot;control orders&quot; -- a loose form of house arrest for security suspects -- as incompatible with human rights laws.</p>
<p>

Macdonald said a &quot;culture of legislative restraint in the area of terrorist crime is central to the existence of an efficient and human rights compatible process&quot;.</p>
<p>

Without such restraint, there would be a greater number of less safe convictions, he added.</p>
<p>

The criminal justice system's response to terrorism must be &quot;proportionate and grounded in due process and the rule of law&quot;, he told his audience.</p>
<p>

&quot;We must protect ourselves from these atrocious crimes without abandoning our traditions of freedom.&quot;</p>
