<p>Wes Hamilton understood it was only a symbolic act, but the Vietnam War veteran hoped his arrest Sunday in the Port of Tacoma would encourage others to voice their opinions against the Iraq war.

&#8220;We&#8217;re standing on principle,&#8221; said Hamilton, a former Marine, minutes before he climbed over a metal barricade at East 11th Street and Thorne Road and was taken into custody by police. </p>
<p>
He was one of at least 23 people arrested Sunday afternoon after they performed peaceful acts of civil disobedience to protest the Iraq war and the movement of Army Stryker brigade vehicles out of the port. </p>
<p>
Fifteen people were arrested after they crossed the police barricade, including Olympia City Council member T.J. Johnson. Eight others were arrested after they donned backpacks or bags and crossed into an area where police had banned such items. About 60 protesters attended the event. </p>
<p>
In a separate protest-related case, a woman was arrested early Sunday morning after she ignored an officer&#8217;s instructions to stop her vehicle and drove into an area of East 11th Street, said police Detective Brad Graham. </p>

<p>
In addition to the 24 people arrested Sunday, police have made eight protest-related arrests since March 5. </p>
<p>
Sunday afternoon&#8217;s arrests were part of a structured, negotiated event involving police and activists. </p>
<p>
After the crowd marched from Port of Tacoma Road to East 11th Street, Tacoma police Sgt. Todd Kitselman politely announced the rules: no backpacks, purses or bags beyond this point, and no climbing or hanging anything on nearby fences.  </p>
<p>
&#8220;We want you guys to have a peaceful protest,&#8221; he said. </p>
<p>
Several minutes passed before 32-year-old Phan Nguyen stepped forward with a black backpack strapped on. He was promptly arrested. </p>

<p>
&#8220;All I have in my backpack is a U.S. Constitution,&#8221; he told police, as the activists cheered and chanted. </p>
<p>
In front of reporters and TV news cameras, seven others quickly stepped forward, were detained and placed in patrol cars. </p>
<p>
Graham said police restricted the backpacks and bags after protesters brought chains and locks earlier in the week. Officers were concerned they might chain themselves to fences or gates, he said. </p>
<p>
The activists then moved about southwest down East 11th Street toward a metal barricade and police dressed in riot gear. </p>
<p>
The group discussed who would cross the line. Council member Johnson negotiated the terms with Sgt. Kitselman: They were to cross the barrier one by one and passively give themselves up. Officers would wait until each person had both feet on the ground to make the arrest. </p>

<p>
As port workers and riot police watched from either side, 15 people separately climbed over the barricade, were placed in plastic zip-tie handcuffs and walked to a waiting bus. Some read a &#8220;citizens injunction,&#8221; a document outlining their reasons against the war. </p>
<p>
&#8220;We don&#8217;t want to be silent,&#8221; 53-year-old Olympia activist Molly Gibbs said shortly before she crossed the barrier.</p><p align="center">&copy; Copyright 2007 Tacoma News, Inc.</p>
