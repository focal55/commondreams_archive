<P> Their passionate opposition to the Iraq war has led them
into jail cells. Today it will bring them to the Senate
offices on Capitol Hill. </P>

<P> A group of New York grandmothers who continually protest
the war through demonstrations, vigils and media blitzes
plans to lobby every U.S. senator today to condemn President
Bush's decision to send 21,500 more American troops
into Iraq to quell sectarian violence. </P>
<P> Barbara Walker, the lone Staten Island member of the New
York clan known as the Granny Peace Brigade, said at least
100 anti-war grandmothers throughout the country are
expected to participate in the effort to pressure each
senator to cut off funding for the increase and withdraw all
American troops by June. </P>
<P> "We went in on the basis of untruths. Because of our
being there, the conflict continues. . . . Our troops
are targets. Having our troops there exacerbates the
situation, because we (went) there uninvited. We are
occupying the country," said Ms. Walker, a 73-year-old
Silver Lake resident and a former United Nations worker who
spent 15 years in Ethiopia administering academic
scholarships and fellowships for African students. </P>
<P> Among their pleas to Congress are cessation of funding for
the war, closure of permanent U.S. bases in Iraq, the return
of all American troops within six months and appropriation
by the Iraqi government of all administrative duties,
including housing, education and medical care. </P>
<P> Ms. Walker was among 18 grandmothers arrested and jailed
for several hours in October 2005 for allegedly blocking a
recruiting station in Times Square during an anti-war rally. </P>
<P> Before lobbying the Senate, the grandmothers will hold a
press conference in the Capitol to discuss their plan
alongside Rep. Dennis Kucinich (D-Ohio), an averred
presidential candidate who advocates ending the war. </P>

<P> Congress is split on whether to thwart the planned troop
deployment. </P>
<P> Rep. Vito Fossella (R-Staten Island/Brooklyn) did not
return calls to discuss his stance yesterday. Fossella, who
voted to authorize the war in 2002, sidestepped questions on
whether he supports the increase after the president's
announcement last week. He spoke in generalities, calling
the plan an indication "of what's necessary in
order to bring about a stable, peaceful Iraq that's in
the best interest of the United States." </P>
<P> In the Senate, several elected officials have floated
strategies for halting the so-called "surge" of
troops. Sen. Chris Dodd (D-Conn.), a senior member of the
foreign relations committee and 2008 presidential hopeful,
introduced legislation to prohibit an increase in U.S.
combat forces without congressional authorization. </P>
<P> Another group of senators, including Republican Chuck Hagel
of Nebraska, a putative presidential candidate, has proposed
a nonbinding resolution against Bush's plan. </P>
<P> New York Sen. Hillary Clinton, the widely predicted
front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination,
went on television and radio yesterday to speak out against
Bush's planned troop deployment but evaded questions on
whether she would vote to block funding for the increase. </P>
<P> Mrs. Clinton also said she would support the nonbinding
resolution. </P>

<P> Sen. Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.), when asked about his stance,
issued the following statement: </P>
<P> "An escalation in the war, particularly with no change
in strategy, makes no sense. We are policing a civil war
right now in Iraq. And whether the troops stay three months
or three years, as soon as they leave, the Sunnis and
Shiites will continue to fight with one another and nothing
will have been accomplished." </P>
