<p>WASHINGTON  - In a move that has surprised many foreign policy 
analysts here, U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice has appointed a 
prominent neo-conservative hawk and leading champion of the Iraq war to 
the post of State Department Counselor.

        <!--/endimage/--> Eliot A. Cohen, who teaches military history at Johns Hopkins School of 
Advanced International Studies (SAIS) here and has also served on the 
Pentagon's Defence Policy Board (DPB) since 2001, will take up the 
position next month that was left vacant late last year by Rice's 
long-time confidant and "realist" thinker, Philip Zelikow.</p>
<p>A close friend and protege of former Secretary of Defence Paul Wolfowitz 
and advisory board member of the American Enterprise Institute (AEI), 
Cohen most recently led the harsh neo-conservative attack on the 
bipartisan Iraq Study Group (ISG), co-chaired by former Secretary of State 
James Baker and former Democratic Rep. Lee Hamilton.</p>
<p>Like his fellow-neo-cons, he was particularly scathing about its 
recommendations for Washington to directly engage Syria and Iran and 
revive the Israeli-Palestinian peace process -- recommendations which Rice 
herself has explicitly endorsed in the last few weeks.
</p>
<p>"This is a group composed, for the most part, of retired eminent public 
officials, most with limited or no expertise in the waging or study of 
war," Cohen wrote in column entitled "No Way to Win a War", published by 
the Wall Street Journal the day after the ISG released its report in early 
December.</p>
<p>"A fatuous process yields, necessarily, fatuous results," he went on in a 
wholesale dismissal of the relevance of what he called the "Washington 
establishment whose wisdom was exaggerated in its heyday, and which has in 
any event succumbed to a kind of political-intellectual entropy since the 
1960s..."</p>
<p>"Eliot brings a lot to the table in terms of being a counselor, being 
somebody who can be an intellectual sounding board for her [Rice]," said 
State Department spokesman Sean McCormack in confirming Cohen's 
appointment Friday.</p>
<p>Some analysts here, however, said they thought the appointment was 
designed instead to reduce or pre-empt criticism from neo-conservatives 
and other hawks in and outside the administration for the direction she 
hopes to take U.S. policy, particularly in the Middle East. With no 
operational responsibilities, the State Department Counselor can be 
used -- or ignored -- at the secretary's discretion.</p>
<p>"Condi may feel she needs to have a neo-con right next to her to protect 
her flanks," said Chris Nelson, editor of the widely read Washington 
insider newsletter, The Nelson Report. "And, if she's really planning to 
put her foot down on the Israelis, which (Washington) will have to do if 
it wants to get a real process with the Palestinians underway as part of a 
bigger regional deal with the Saudis and Iranians, then a guy like Cohen 
up there on the (State Department's) seventh floor who is in on it and can 
claim influence on the outcome can help."</p>
<p>"Bringing on Cohen could help inoculate her from criticism by the Cheney 
camp," agreed Steven Clemons, director of the American Strategy Programme 
at the New America Foundation in a reference to the vice president and the 
neo-conservatives and other hawks who surround him. "One of the things 
that's been consistent is that Rice never takes Cheney head-on and is very 
careful not to take on people who might antagonise him."</p>
<p>In that respect, Cohen is a nearly ideal choice. Like Cheney, Cohen was a 
founding member in 1997 of the Project for the New American Century whose 
positions on how to prosecute the "war on terror" -- including the 
invasion of Iraq and cutting ties to the Palestinian Authority (PA) under 
Yassir Arafat -- he has consistently endorsed.</p>
<p>Although lacking in any regional expertise or policy-making experience, 
Cohen has written prolifically in recent years on U.S. policy in the 
Middle East.</p>
<p>
Cohen first gained national prominence shortly after the 9/11 attacks when 
he published a Wall Street Journal column entitled "World War IV" -- a 
moniker quickly adopted by hard-line neo-cons like former CIA director and 
fellow-DPB member James Woolsey, former Commentary editor Norman 
Podhoretz, and Center for Security Policy president Frank Gaffney (on 
whose board Cohen also sits) -- to put Bush's "war on terror" in what he 
considered to be the appropriate historical context and to define its 
enemy as "militant Islam".</p>
<p>After defeating the Taliban, he argued, Washington should not only "finish 
off" Iraq's Saddam Hussein, whom he accused of having "helped al Qaeda", 
but also seek to overthrow "the mullahs" in Iran whose replacement by a 
"moderate or secular government would be no less important a victory in 
this war than the annihilation of (Osama) bin Laden."</p>
<p>In another Journal article in April 2002 when the second Palestinian 
intifada was at its height, Cohen, who had just signed a PNAC letter which 
called for severing ties to the PA and asserted that "Israel's fight 
against terrorism is our fight," argued that proposals to send an 
international force that would separate Israeli forces from the 
Palestinians were "notàserious". "(T)here are times when well-intentioned 
measures can only make matters worse," he warned.</p>
<p>Cohen has also been quick to label critics of Israel and the so-called 
"Israel Lobby" in the U.S. as anti-Semites.</p>
<p>"Only a reshuffling of the deck -- through the disappearance of Arafat, or 
an event, such as the overthrow of Saddam Hussein) that profoundly changes 
the mood in the Arab world -- will make something approaching truce, let 
alone peace, possible," he argued in a favourite pre-Iraq war 
neo-conservative theme.</p>
<p>The following summer, Cohen achieved new fame when Bush was photographed 
carrying Cohen's just-published book, "Supreme Command", which argued that 
the greatest civilian war-time leaders, such as Abraham Lincoln and 
Winston Churchill, had a far better strategic sense than their generals. 
It was a particularly timely message in the months that preceded the Iraq 
war when a surprising number of recently military brass here were voicing 
strong reservations about the impending U.S. invasion.</p>
<p>He also became a charter member of the Committee for the Liberation of 
Iraq (CLI), an administration-supported group both to lobby for war in 
Iraq, largely on behalf of Ahmad Chalabi's Iraqi National Congress (INC). 
Indeed, Cohen, like his friend Wolfowitz, was already arguing publicly for 
Washington to rely heavily on the INC in any effort to overthrow Hussein 
in December 2001.</p>
<p>After the Iraq invasion, however, Cohen became progressively more critical 
of the way in which the subsequent occupation and counter-insurgency were 
being carried out, although, after a Pentagon-sponsored tour of Iraq that 
featured interviews with top U.S. military commanders there, including 
Gen. George Casey, last February, he became briefly more optimistic.</p>
<p>"After a wretched start, we have the right people at the top and the right 
policies in effect -- and even more importantly, the right philosophy 
behind it all," he wrote in yet another Journal article entitled "Will We 
Persevere?"
</p>
<p>Just nine months later, however, he had changed his mind. In the same 
article in which he attacked the ISG, he described U.S. difficulties as 
"stem(ming) not so much from failures to find the right strategy, as from 
an astounding and depressing inability to implement the strategic and 
operational choices we have nominally made" - an inability, for example, 
"as personal as picking the wrong people for key positionsà"</p>
<p>Still, while admitting in a Vanity Fair interview late last year that U.S. 
choices in Iraq range between "bad and awful," Cohen has called for 
perseverance and played a key role in selling AEI-hatched plan to add some 
30,000 troops to the 140,000 soldiers in Iraq to Bush with whom he met 
personally as part of a small group of "surge"-boosters at the White House 
in mid-December.</p>
<p>If the surge should fail, however, Cohen's preferred and "most plausible" 
option, which he laid out in an October 2006 Journal column titled 'Plan 
B', would be a coup d'etat ("which we quietly endorse") that would bring 
to power a "junta of military modernizers", a development which, as he 
noted himself, would call into question the administration's and Rice's 
avowed goal of democratisation.</p>
<p>In any event, he argued in the same column, "American prestige has taken a 
hard knock (in Iraq); it will probably take a harder knock, and in ways 
that will not be restored without a considerable and successful use of 
American military power down the road."</p>
<p>"The tides of Sunni salafism and Iran's distinct combination of messianism 
and power politics have not crested, and will not crest without much 
greater violence in which we too will be engaged," he asserted.</p>
<p>In a Vanity Fair interview last fall, Cohen said, "I'm pretty grim. I 
think we're heading for a very dark world, because the long-term 
consequences of this are very large, not just for Iraq, not just for the 
region, but globally -- for our reputation, for what the Iranians do, all 
kinds of stuff."</p>
<p>If Rice's intent was to reassure Cheney and the neo-conservatives that she 
is not a captive of the ISG and the "Washington establishment", that 
passage alone should do the trick.
