camped outside House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's San Francisco home Wednesday, 
the latest in an almost daily barrage of demonstrations, vigils and local 
government votes designed to convince Pelosi to refuse President George W. 
Bush's 100-billion-dollar war funding request.<br><br>

The speaker says she will support the request with conditions.
<br><br>
Pelosi originally voted against the war four years ago and says she wants 
it to end. But that rhetoric is not enough for liberal San Franciscans, 
including elected officials like City Supervisor Ross Mirkarimi, who spoke 
at a rally in front of her office Monday.
<br><br>
"I did not and will not accept the excuses of even the most pragmatic, 
prudent, or progressive sounding representative in Congress in explaining 
to us that this war abroad is such a quagmire that there is no reason no 
we can pull out," Mirkarimi told a crowd of hundreds.
<br><br>
"They should be unelected," he said. "They should be taken out of office."
<br><br>
As Mirkarimi spoke, 11 activists -- including a San Francisco mother whose 
son served 3 tours in Iraq -- were arrested as they staged a sit-in in 
Pelosi's office. Across the city, 57 protesters were arrested, many 
blocking traffic while pretending to die on Market Street, the city's main 
drag.
<br><br>
Demonstrators said Pelosi, who represents the city in the House of 
Representatives, is out of line with a majority of her constituents. Last 
November, city voters approved by 58 percent a measure calling for the 
impeachment of President Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney.
<br><br>
"Nancy Pelosi some time ago made a conscious decision that she was going 
to stop representing San Francisco and start trying to be a national 
figure," said Tim Redmond, the editor of the city's progressive Bay 
Guardian news weekly.

<br><br>
The speaker of the House disagrees and released a statement to 
demonstrators outside her office "thanking" them for their "opposition to 
the war in Iraq."
<br><br>
"I agree that the war must end and am working within Congress to achieve 
that goal," she said.
<br><br>
Still, Redmond believes it will be difficult for locals to change the 
speaker's mind on the question of war funding.
<br><br>
"When she began moving towards becoming speaker of the House, she left 
behind San Francisco values and went with a more mainstream approach that 
will help her court Democrats in swing districts," he added.
<br><br>
While a liberal by national standards, Pelosi has staked out a more 
centrist position on Iraq than other Congresspersons from the San 
Francisco Bay area. Congresswoman Barbara Lee, who represents Oakland, and 
Lynn Woolsey, who represents the suburbs north of San Francisco, have 
introduced legislation requiring all U.S. troops to leave Iraq within six 
months.
<br><br>
The bill, HR 508, has 49 co-sponsors, including most members of the Bay 
Area's Congressional delegation. As speaker, Pelosi has buried the bill in 
the House Subcommittee on Immigration, Citizenship, Refugees, and Border 
Security.
<br><br>
Redmond is heartened, however, by a vote by the local Democratic Party 
Central Committee urging Congress to revoke President Bush's authority to 
wage war in Iraq and cut off all funding for the war -- except as 
"necessary to provide for the safe and orderly withdrawal" of the troops.
<br><br>
Howard Wallace, the vice president of the San Francisco Labor Council, 
part of the national union confederation AFL-CIO, says Pelosi fought the 
measure, but couldn't stop it from passing.
<br>
<br>

"We turned out a crowd," he said, "and everyone was on our side. We had 
some very good people on the committee and we could see things shifting 
before our eyes, and then we found out that they had a substitute 
motion -- and that was to water down the whole bill. They put in some 
glittering generalities that said really nothing and it was aimed at just 
getting us out of the way," he said.
<br><br>
"It didn't say anything," Wallace said. "It was insider talk, which is 
always full of stuff like that, and we can't take that kind of crap 
anymore."
<br><br>
In the end, almost all of San Francisco's city supervisors and state 
legislators voted for the antiwar measure. A few abstained. Pelosi's 
representative was the only central committee member to vote no.
<br><br>
"All this adds up and puts pressure on her and in a sense embarrasses 
her," said Bay Guardian editor Tim Redomond. "It says 'look, you're not 
making your constituents happy'. It also in a way gives her political 
cover because when she's in Washington she can say: 'Look at my 
constituents. My voters are way to the left of me.' It lets her push that 
edge a little more if she wants to."
<br><br>
If Pelosi doesn't respond to community pressure, Redmond says, a primary 
challenge or third party candidacy is possible. Such a challenger would 
likely lose, he says, put would serve to further increase pressure on the 
House speaker.&nbsp;<img src="http://cache.boston.com/bonzai-fba/File-Based_Image_Resource/dingbat_story_end_icon.gif" width="6" height="8" border="0" alt="" /> </p>
