<p>WASHINGTON - Two weeks ago, Pentagon officials discussed a 
strategy to escalate U.S. pressure on Iran with the intention of creating 
the impression that the U.S. is ready to go to war, according to an 
account by one of the participants.

A meeting at the Pentagon in mid-February was said by the participant to 
have revolved around a plan to ratchet up U.S. rhetoric about an Iranian 
threat and make further military preparations for war in a way that would 
be reminiscent of what happened prior to the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 
2003. The account was described by a source outside the Pentagon who 
obtained it directly from the participant.</p>
<p>The description of Pentagon thinking suggests a strategy that is much more 
aggressive than the line represented by Secretary of State Condoleezza 
Rice's announcement Tuesday that the United States would participate in 
direct talks with Iran in the context of a conference to be convened by 
the Iraqi government.</p>
<p>According to the account provided by the participant, the administration's 
decision last month to increase U.S. military strength in Iraq by at least 
22,000 troops is related more to a strategy of increased pressure on Iran 
than to stabilizing the situation in Baghdad. The troop decision was 
described as putting the U.S. military in a better position to respond to 
attacks by Shiite forces on U.S troops in retaliation against a possible 
U.S. strike against Iran.
</p>
<p>That description is consistent with other indications that Pres. George W. 
Bush's decision on the troop "surge" was made primarily in the context of 
strategy toward Iran. Immediately after Bush's Jan. 10 speech announcing 
the additional troops, NBC's Tim Russert reported that Bush and his top 
advisers had told a small group of journalists the United States would not 
sit down with Iran until the United States had gained "leverage".</p>
<p>That was the most direct indication from administration officials that 
they believed the United States could negotiate successfully with Iran 
once the administration had altered the bargaining relationship with 
Tehran.</p>
<p>In that same briefing for reporters, according to Russert, the officials 
indicated that one of the administration objectives was to achieve a 
situation in which Washington would not have to "go to Syria and Iran" and 
"ask for anything". That was an indirect reference to the bargaining 
leverage that Iran was believed to have derived from the widely shared 
belief that the United States would need Iran's help to stabilize the 
situation in Iraq.</p>
<p>Bush was apparently convinced that the troops increase would convince Iran 
that the United States would not have to rely on Iranian influence in Iraq 
to deal with Shiite opposition to the occupation.</p>
<p>But the troop surge decision was also linked to another aspect of the 
U.S.-Iran bargaining relationship. It had been widely speculated that the 
vulnerability of the United States to retaliatory attacks in Iraq added to 
Iran's leverage by restraining the Bush administration from waging a 
preemptive war against Iran.</p>
<p>The briefing before Bush's Jan. 10 speech also provided a key piece of 
evidence that the Bush strategy would involve increasing pressure on Iran 
by framing the issue of U.S. policy in terms of new military threats from 
Iran to U.S. and allied interests in the Middle East. Russert reported 
that administration officials had tipped off journalists that Iran would 
soon be raised as a major issue in what Russert called "a very acute way".</p>
<p>The January Bush speech was followed by a carefully orchestrated campaign 
of administration statements and leaks alleging official Iranian 
involvement in providing armour-penetrating weapons to Shiite militias in 
Iraq. The administration admitted in a briefing in Baghdad aimed at 
bolstering that charge that it was based on "inference" rather than actual 
evidence.</p>
<p>To increase the sense of heightened tension with Iran and suggest momentum 
toward a military confrontation, the administration had already moved an 
additional carrier task force into the Persian Gulf.</p>
<p>
Another move in the increased pressure on Iran, according to the same 
source, is that refuelling assets are now being flown into the U.S. base 
complex at Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean. "You can't launch air strikes 
against Iran without refuelling assets being there," the source observed.</p>
<p>High administration officials have used carefully chosen words in recent 
weeks to suggest that they are planning for war against Iran even as press 
leaks about as possible attack multiplied. On Feb. 15, Defense Secretary 
Robert Gates said, "We are not looking for an excuse to go to war with 
Iran...We are not planning a war with Iran."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, however, the administration maintains the position that the 
option of a military strike against Iran remains as its last resort if 
Iran does not agree to U.S. terms for negotiations.</p>
<p>After the administration failed to produce evidence of such Iranian 
government involvement in exporting weapons to the Shiites in a Baghdad 
press conference on Feb. 11, the administration introduced a new line on 
an alleged Iranian threat.</p>
<p>Vice-Admiral Patrick Walsh, who is leaving his position as Commander of 
U.S. Naval Forces Central Command, told reporters Feb. 19 that the Iranian 
military conducts exercises in the Strait of Hormuz, suggesting that they 
could use mines to close the Strait. Walsh called mines "an offensive 
terrorist type of weapon."</p>
<p>Iranian officials have always placed their threats to close the Strait of 
Hormuz explicitly in the context of retaliation for a strike by the United 
States against Iran.</p>
<p>"The question is not what the Americans are planning," Walsh said, "but 
what the Iranians are planning." That statement indicates that the United 
States is designing a new campaign to portray Iran's military posture as 
threatening to U.S. allies and security in the Middle East.</p>
<p>The participant's account of the Pentagon meeting did not indicate any 
timetable for the sequence of steps or what the climactic move in the 
campaign would be. Nor did it suggest that a decision had been made by the 
White House to launch air strikes against Iran. However, the moves now 
planned would increase the likelihood of war in the event that 
Washington's escalatory moves fail to sway Iran's leaders.</p>
<p>A former assistant secretary of defense in the Bill Clinton 
administration, Chas Freeman, who was also ambassador to Saudi Arabia, 
calls Bush's escalation of military pressure "brinksmanship" -- a term 
recalling the practice by President Dwight D. Eisenhower and his Secretary 
of State John Foster Dulles of threatening war against China over Korea 
and the Taiwan Strait.
</p>
<p>"By deploying forces to add credibility to the threat," Freeman told IPS, 
"you increase the risk of military conflict, which is fact what is 
intended."</p>
