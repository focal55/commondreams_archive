From north to south, from east to west, violence and insecurity have gripped the entirety of Iraq. In January alone, at least 2,000 civilians, Iraqi security forces and US and British troops were killed in violence across the nation. 
<p>
  As President George Bush dispatches an additional 21,500 combat troops &shy; and 
  at least as many again in a supporting role &shy; to try to bring calm to 
  Baghdad, new figures suggest that violent death is becoming an everyday 
  occurrence across all of Iraq and in cities that rarely make the headlines. 
  In recent weeks places such as Kut and Mosul have reported civilian deaths 
  as a result of gunfire or explosions.

</font>"There has long been this idea that if you control Baghdad you can 
  control the whole country, but that just does not make sense," said Nir 
  Rosen, a fellow at the Washington-based New America Foundation who has spent 
  more than two years in Iraq reporting on the violence. "Iraq has 
  fragmented. I don't think Baghdad has any relevance to what is happening in 
  Kirkuk, Mosul, Basra or Ramadi."
</p>
<p>
  In December, Margaret Beckett, the Foreign Secretary, said: "I think 
  it's still the case that 80 per cent of the violence that we are hearing 
  about is taking place... in four provinces out of the 18."
</p>
<p>
  Of Mr Bush's plan, Mr Rosen said: "It would not make a difference if we 
  sent 100,000 troops... I cannot imagine how they think they can succeed. 
  Americans are not the solution." 
</p>
<p>
  Available data suggests that Baghdad is the most perilous place in Iraq. 
  Just last weekend, at least 132 people were killed and more than 300 wounded 
  when a suicide bomber detonated explosives in a lorry in the city's Sadriya 
  market.
</p>

<p>
  But it appears that few, if any, parts of the country are safe. Indeed, the 
  most recent figures, collated by The New York Times, may well underestimate 
  the levels of violence in other parts of the country because they rely on 
  media reports, the Iraqi government and the US military, which almost 
  certainly include only a portion of the numbers killed.
</p>
<p>
  Professor Richard Garfield, an epidemiologist at Columbia University and 
  co-author of a 2004 study which estimated that at least 100,000 Iraqis had 
  died since the 2003 invasion, said: "One of the myths that Washington 
  has been pushing is that it is pretty peaceful in Iraq and that the problems 
  only exist in four governates. But if you only count [casualties] in four 
  governates that is what you will find." He added: "There are lots 
  of cities with high amounts of fighting that we don't even know about." 
</p>
<p>
  Almost four years after the US and British invasion of Iraq, reliable 
  statistics on the human cost of the war remain scarce. A report, published 
  last October by Dr Garfield's colleagues, estimated that 655,000 civilians 
  and security personnel had lost their lives.
</p>
<p>
  The UN High Commissioner for Refugees estimates that about two million 
  Iraqis &shy; about 8 per cent of the pre-war population &shy; have fled the country. 
  An additional 1.7 million people are displaced inside Iraq.

</p>
<p>
  Violence continued to rock Baghdad yesterday, where an Iraqi general took 
  formal control of the security operation. Reports said at least 38 people 
  were killed in bomb and mortar attacks.
</p>
<p>
  Meanwhile, the Syrian President Bashar Assad said in an interview yesterday 
  that the Bush administration does not have the vision to bring peace.
</p>
<p>
  "We're not the only player, we're not the single player. But we are the 
  main player in this issue," he said. "Our role is going to be 
  through supporting the dialogue between the different parties inside Iraq 
  with support from the other parties, like the Americans and any other 
  country in the world."
