<p> Older people are better known for protesting about pensions and council tax, but a growing number are setting their sights on protecting the planet.

  This month saw the launch of a new transatlantic website, linking a growing number of grey-haired greens who are making the environment their cause.

    	  
  	
    
<p />
    	  
  	
    
      
One such campaigner is 61-year-old Irene Willis, who knew she was not cut out for the stereotypical pensioner's life when she retired.

    	  
  	
    
      <p />
    	  
  	
    
      
So instead of crosswords and Countdown, she found another way to pass the time: as a direct-action environmental activist, chaining herself to fences and breaking in to nuclear bases.

    	  
  	
    
      <p />
    	  
  	
    
      
In the four years since she discovered non-violent protest she estimates she has been arrested up to 25 times, and believes her age and appearance make her an asset to the movement.

    	  
  	
    
      <p />
    	  
  	
    
      

"On demos, I can get away with murder," she laughs. "The police are much more lenient with grey-haired old ladies than with younger protesters."

    	  
  	
    
      <p />
    	  
  	
    
      
Irene is typical of a new breed of ecology-conscious older people on a mission to save the world.

    	  
  	
    
      <p />
    	  
  	
    
      
This month saw the launch of a GreenSeniors.org, a web-based network for older people set up by activists in the UK and US which hails Irene as a "green hero".

    	  
  	
    
      <p />
    	  
  	
    
      
A poll for the UN World Environment Day last year found pensioners are the most eco-friendly age group in the UK: over 90% recycle their litter, four out of five take showers rather than baths and 79% use low-energy light bulbs.

    	  
  	
    
      <p />
    	  
  	
    
      <b>
    	  
  	
    
      'No-one listens'
    	  
  	
    
      </b>
    	  
  	
    
      <p />

    	  
  	
    
      
This is because getting older makes you more concerned about what you will leave behind, Irene believes.

    	  
  	
    
      <p />
    	  
  	
    
      
Her passion for fighting climate change, pollution and global injustice has seen her landed with £800 outstanding in court fines, which she refuses to pay. In 2004 her refusal to pay an earlier fine saw her jailed for 10 days in Edmonds Hill Prison, Suffolk.

      <p />

    	  
  	
    
      
A former infant school teacher with three grown-up children, she became hooked on direct action after joining the protest against nuclear weapons at RAF Lakenheath. 

    	  
  	
    
      <p />
    	  
  	
    
      
She went on to campaign against climate change and local developments near her home in Canvey Island, Essex, and has stood twice for parliament as a Green candidate.

    	  
  	
    
      <p />
    	  
  	
    
      
Her militancy is a reaction to ageism, she believes: "When you get old, suddenly no-one listens to you anymore. Direct action makes me feel empowered.

    	  
  	
    
      <p />
    	  
  	
    
      
"I've still got the energy to do all this and that won't last forever. I know I'm in the final years of my life and I want to make the most of it.

    	  
  	
    
      <p />
    	  
  	
    
      
"I can afford to go to prison - I'm not going to lose my job, I'm not going to lose my house."

    	  
  	
    
      <p />

      </b>
    	  
  	
    
      <p />
    	  
  	
    
      

The view that older people have more time and energy to devote to the cause is shared by Joyce Emery, 63, co-founder of GreenSeniors.org, a mother of one and grandmother of six from Ames, Iowa, in the US. 

    	  
  	
    
      <p />
    	  
  	
    
      
After retiring from her civil service job last year she threw herself into activism, setting up her own blog, GreenGranny.org, and bombarding her elected representatives with e-mails.

    	  
  	
    
      <p />
    	  
  	
    
      
She says: "Younger people are so focused on getting ahead financially, on keeping up with expectations of what it is to be successful. Older people realise there is more to life.

"When I was working, a daughter still at school and my elderly mother to care for, I had no time for anything else.

    	  
  	
    
      <p />
    	  
  	
    
      
"But now I've got all this free time I want to use it productively. As you get older you become more concerned about the future of the planet, about what it will be like for your grandchildren."

      <p />
    	  
  	
    
      
Another activist who believes it is never too late to make your lifestyle more eco-friendly is Amyan MacFadyen from Sheffield, south Yorkshire.

    	  
  	
    
      <p />
    	  
  	
    
      

Last year he decided it was environmentally irresponsible to drive a car. So he traded his own one in for a bicycle - at the age of 85.

    	  
  	
    
      <p />
    	  
  	
    
      
"Sheffield is very hilly, so it's not all that good for bikes," he says.

    	  
  	
    
      <p />
    	  
  	
    
      
"But I am very concerned about climate change and the catastrophic effect it's going to have on the Earth's population."

    	  
  	
    
      <p />
    	  
  	
    
      
A former professor of Ecology and Environmental Science at the University of Ulster, he only turned to campaigning after retiring in 1986.

    	  
  	
    
      <p />
    	  
  	
    
      
For 10 years he was convenor of his local branch of Friends of the Earth in Bannside, Northern Ireland. A keen gardener, he was popular for bringing his home-grown organic vegetables to meetings.

    	  
  	
    
      <p />
    	  
  	
    
      
Last year he moved to Sheffield, where he joined local activists clearing parks and green spaces of litter and debris. 

    	  
  	
    
      <p />

    	  
  	
    
      
He adds: "I have four children and seven grandchildren, and it does make you worry about what sort of world they will live in."

    	  
  	
    
      <p />
    	  
  	
    
      
With advocates like Amyan, Irene and Joyce on their side, green activists will hope that our ageing population will also be an increasingly eco-friendly one too.
