<p>Fruit is a big seller for parents who want to feed their children 
nutritious food. So it's no surprise that manufacturers prominently display 
berries, cherries and oranges on boxes of breakfast cereals, drink cans and 
yogurt containers.

Unfortunately, according to health advocates,  many companies fail to put 
the fruit where it counts  --  inside the products. 
<P>The Prevention Institute and the Strategic Alliance for Healthy Food and 
Activity Environments, an Oakland-based  coalition of California's leading 
public health, physical activity and nutrition organizations, say more than 
half of the most aggressively advertised children's foods that show fruit on 
their packaging or even put the word "fruit" in their name contain no fruit.  
<P>Yoplait Go-Gurt Strawberry Splash yogurt, Fruity Cheerios and Berry Berry 
Kix are just a few of the products named in the organization's study being 
released today, "Where's the Fruit?" 
<P>Some products boast natural fruit flavorings, but those don't contain the 
nutrients of real fruit. 
<P>"Frankly, it was pretty surprising to find that nearly 51 percent of these 
products had no fruit in them at all and that 16 percent had minimal fruit," 
said Leslie Mikkelsen, managing director of the Prevention Institute and a 
registered dietitian, who headed up the four-month research project.  
<P>"Parents are rushing through grocery stores with their kids, and a lot of 
them are relying on what they see on the front of the package. Most are too 
harried to read the fine print." 
<P>The organization used a 2006 study by the nonprofit Henry J. Kaiser Family 
Foundation to identify which children's foods were most heavily advertised on 
television. More than $10 billion a year is spent on marketing food to 
children, according to Prevention Institute. 
<P>Strategic Alliance narrowed down the foundation's findings to supermarket 
products that featured fruit on the packaging, a $3 billion-a-year industry. 
When they pored over the labels of the 37 items selected, they found that what 
was pictured on the front of the box wasn't necessarily found in the list of 
ingredients on the back.  

<P>"The deception is really intolerable," said Larry Cohen, executive 
director of the Prevention Institute. "There is really no excuse for misleading 
parents in a way that weakens their ability to encourage their children's 
health."  
<P>Children's diets are of particular concern these days in light of growing 
rates of obesity and Type 2 diabetes, both of which are related to poor 
nutrition. 
<P>Cohen and Mikkelsen said they hope the study will be a wake-up call to 
parents and nudge food and beverage companies to change their policies. They 
also would like to see the Food and Drug Administration strengthen its rules on 
packaging and advertising. 
<P>"Current FDA regulations on health claims and product definitions, such as 
those for fruit drinks, are not sufficiently protecting parents and children," 
the report states. "These regulations need to be updated to ensure the 
packaging clearly states fruit content on the cover." 
<P>The FDA did not return calls Thursday. But Michael Jacobson, executive 
director of the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a nonprofit 
nutrition and science advocacy group based in Washington, D.C., says the FDA's 
typical reaction is to point to a lack of resources to pursue these types of 
cases. Although there are laws that forbid false package advertising, Jacobson 
said they contain so many loopholes that these cases are difficult to win in 
court. 
<P>"There is tremendous deception out there, and it's become part of what's 
expected," he said. "It's a scuzzy little corner of the food industry." 
<P>General Mills, which the Prevention Institute report calls one of the 
biggest offenders, did not respond to questions Thursday. 
<P>"They would just say that they're being truthful on the (nutrition) 
label," said Marion Nestle, professor of food studies and public health at New 
York University, and author of "What to Eat." 
<P>She urges all parents to carefully scrutinize labels but says that to 
understand them, "you have to be a Talmudic scholar." 
<P>"Unfortunately, if there is a health claim on the package, people believe 
it," she said. "And people think a picture of a piece of fruit is a health 
claim."

They may taste fruity, but ... 

<P>The following products with 
fruit in the name or illustrated on the front of the package contained either 
no fruit at all or a minimal amount of fruit (in the form of 2-10 percent fruit 
juice), according to a study released today. These products were chosen for the 
study because they are heavily advertised.
