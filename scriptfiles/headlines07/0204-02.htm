They said the crisis over Tehran's nuclear programme must be resolved through diplomacy, urging Washington to start direct talks with Iran.</p>
<p>The letter was published in Britain's Sunday Times newspaper.

<p>"As former US military leaders, we strongly caution against the use of military force against Iran," the authors said.</p>
<p>They said such action would further exacerbate regional and global tensions.</p>
<p>"A strategy of diplomatic engagement with Iran would serve the interests of the US and the UK and potentially could enhance regional and international security," the letter said.</p>
<p>It also said that "the British government has a vital role play in securing a renewed diplomatic push and making it clear that it will oppose any recourse to military force".</p>
<p>The US and its Western allies suspect Iran of using its nuclear programme as a cover to produce nuclear weapons, a claim denied by Tehran.</p>
<p>Washington has so far refused to rule out military action if Iran does not halt its nuclear activities.</p>
<p>The US has also recently beefed up its military presence in the Gulf.
