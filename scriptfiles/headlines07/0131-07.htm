<p>Diane Baker's voice was barely audible above the rumble of the trash can she pushed down the sidewalk. But her actions tended to speak louder, anyway.

<p>Four months ago, Baker was one of 71 people arrested during a protest in Washington for crossing a police line to sit on the steps of a Senate office building.

As punishment, the 60-year-old was sentenced to sweep the streets of the nation's capital for eight cold, blustery hours Tuesday.
</p> 
          
<p>"I'm a rather fragile, small woman," said Baker, a hospice chaplain at United Church of Christ in Dallas. "Being a minister, I offered to do counseling, but this is what they gave me."
</p> 
          
<p>Baker, a mother of four and grandmother of two, suffers from myoclonic epilepsy, a degenerative muscle condition that causes her voice to quiver and hands to shake. As she signed in to begin her community service, she struggled to write her name.
</p> 
          
<p>With morning temperatures in Washington in the high 20s, Baker prepared for the cold as if a protest could start any minute.
</p> 
          
<p>She wore 10 multicolored  T-shirts with messages ranging from "End the War in Iraq" to "Shut Down Guantanamo" and "Save Darfur." She also wore her clerical stole with a dove carrying an olive branch sewn into the fabric.
</p> 
          
<p>But on top of her layers of pacifism, Baker donned a fluorescent red vest with bold letters to remind her of why she was holding a dust bin and broom: "DC Superior Court Community Service."
</p> 
          
<p>As she put it on, she said, "I think there are better uses of my resources."
</p> 
          
<p>Her arrest in September was just another small consequence in a lifetime of civil disobedience. She has had handcuffs slapped on her wrists 25 times, she said.
</p> 
          

<p>"But my arms are thin, so I usually get out of them," she said with a mischievous smile.
</p> 
          
<p>She has shared a jail cell with the Rev. Jesse Jackson and received a phone call on New Year's Eve from anti-war activist Cindy Sheehan. Baker once walked 120 miles from Irving, near Dallas, to meet Sheehan for a war protest outside President Bush's ranch in Crawford.
</p> 
          
<p>Her community service came three days after tens of thousands protesters, including Baker, gathered in Washington to demand a withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq. No arrests were made, according to police.
</p> 
          
<p>But as growing skepticism in Congress energizes the anti-war movement, Baker served as a stark reminder Tuesday of the limitations to freedom of speech.
</p> 
          
<p>Fritz Mulhauser, a staff attorney for the ACLU in Washington, said a D.C. statute was rewritten recently to place greater limitations on police during demonstrations, such as requiring them to give loud, repeated warnings.
</p> 
          
<p>"That's going to benefit protesters," he said.
</p> 
          
<p>Briefed on the details of Baker's case, Mulhauser said her arrest was probably justified. But, he added, "handing out meals at a soup kitchen is also a satisfying sentence."
</p> 
          
<p>As Baker slowly dragged her trash can down the streets of downtown Washington, she acknowledged that she had learned a lesson, albeit one on the "stupidity" of the justice system in "a country built on freedom of speech."
</p> 
          
<p>"They like to use this as a system of shame," she said, crouching down to pick up a cigarette butt lodged in a crack in the sidewalk. "But I'm not ashamed to be an American."
</p>
