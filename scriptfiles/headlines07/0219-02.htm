justify its project for a missile defence
base in Eastern Europe are becoming less and less convincing to public 
opinion and experts
of the countries involved.
<br>
<br>
The United States intends to set up an anti-missile base in Poland and a 
radar control
center in the Czech Republic as part of its National Missile Defence (NMD) 
programme by
2011. The plan is supported by both the Polish and Czech governments.
<br>
<br>
Germany, Britain and Canada have rejected hosting elements of the U.S. 
system.
<br>
<br>
Polls suggest the majority of Czechs and Poles are opposed to the base out 
of fear of
turning their countries into supporters of Washington's controversial 
Middle East policy
and into targets of terrorism.

<br>
<br>
Those in favour expect economic benefits and argue the base will increase 
the countries'
security and prestige while reinforcing their alliance with the United 
States.
<br>
<br>
The justification advanced by Washington for the base is that it will 
protect the Western
world from missile attacks originating in such "rough states" as North 
Korea or Iran. <br>
<br>
The Polish government is reportedly putting forth a set of demands, 
including
participation in development, military aid, and an upgrading of the United 
States's visa
policy towards its citizens.
<br>
<br>
The Czechs have been accused of political naivety for simply counting on 
economic and
political benefits, though Prague hopes to obtain similar benefits in visa 
policy.
<br>
<br>
The Czech right-wing government will face additional problems in 
parliament in approving
the radar construction, as most parties are either pressing for a 
referendum or complain
the system will be built outside the framework of the North Atlantic 
Treaty Organisation
(NATO) to which they belong.
<br>
<br>
Most NATO members are sceptical of the cost, effectiveness and necessity 
of the U.S. base.
<br>
<br>
Military experts have argued that the "rough states" have neither the 
intention nor the
technology to attack the United States or its allies, adding that any 
missiles would be
better intercepted from Turkey, another NATO member. <br>
<br>
Security analysts have also signaled the base could be part of U.S. 
efforts to face future
threats from Russia and China, but note Moscow has already developed 
technology
capable of bypassing the costly defence shield project.
<br>
<br>

In agreement with views held by pro-disarmament groups, some experts 
likewise argue
the system will encourage the development of offensive systems intent on 
re-establishing
the world's strategic balance.
<br>
<br>
During a recent security conference in Munich, Russian President Vladimir 
Putin cautioned
the shield would fuel a new arms race, and vowed Moscow's response would 
be "effective
and asymmetric, to the highest degree."
<br>
<br>
Moscow is also irritated by the radar's ability to monitor military 
movements well inside
Russian territory, but right-wing politicians in the region are dismissing 
Russian
statements as part of Putin's domestic policy.
<br>
<br>
The Czech government is also planning an information campaign on the base.
<br>
<br>
Jan Tamas, head of the 'No to the Bases' initiative, an umbrella group of 
international civic
organisations against the base, told IPS that information available in 
much of the press is
biased in favour of construction of the military complex.
<br>
<br>
"They talk about the so-called threats to support their case, without 
mentioning the real
threats that will emerge as a result of the establishment of the base," he 
told IPS. "We
notice a clear interest to distort reality, regardless of the consequences 
and regardless of
the opinion of the people."
<br>
<br>
In the Czech Republic the pro-base side has frequently accused opponents 
of the base of "Anti-Americanism", a claim demystified in surveys carried out by some 
newspapers and
institutions. <br>
<br>
Instead of suffering from a hatred of everything "American", Jan Cervenka, 
from the Public
Opinion Research Centre, said in an interview that Czechs are divided over 
Washington's
foreign policy "across political affiliations."
<br>
<br>
Some academics in the region will rather see the ideological bias on the 
pro-U.S. side. "Czechs are frustrated with being categorised as part of Eastern Europe, 
and elites
adopted pro-U.S. ideologies as a way of proving their belonging to the 
West," a political
scientist from Central European University told IPS on condition of 
anonymity. <br>
<br>
"Since the fall of communism, Czech right-wing nationalism has been 
intrinsically linked
to neo-liberal ideology, which is often more pro-U.S. than in the U.S. 
itself," the professor
said. <br>
<br>
In Poland, the press has published a number of reports in which it is 
argued U.S.-based
pro-armament lobbying groups are actively working on generating a climate 
in favour of
the base.
<br>
<br>
These claims were backed by Prof. Roman Kuzniar, until recently president 
of the state-
supported Polish Institute for International Affairs. Kuzniar advised 
Polish Prime Minister
Jaroslaw Kaczynski not to build the base, arguing that U.S. security would 
be built at the
expense of Poland's.
<br>
<br>
Kuzniar, speaking to Polish press last week, claimed that "entirely 
serious" media outlets
on friendly terms with U.S. lobbying groups "sometimes publish complete 
rubbish about
what benefits we will gain from the shield," adding that "many 
politicians' sympathy for it
stems from ignorance about what this system really is."
<br>
<br>
The expert claimed that "stories about attacks from rogue states can be 
written off as fairy
tales, because countries are not suicidal." He added that "wars are 
started by hegemonic,
stronger countries, not by weak ones."
<br>
<br>
Kuzniar's "anti-American" views cost him his job. Kaczynski fired him the 
day before the
interview was published. Polish defence minister Radoslaw Sikorski 
resigned last week
over disagreements with the Prime Minister. </p>
