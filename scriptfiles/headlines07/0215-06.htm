<p>The US invasion plan for Iraq envisaged that only 5,000 US troops would remain in Iraq by December 2006, declassified Central Command documents show.
    	  
  	
    
<p />
    	  
  	
    
      
The material also shows that the US military projected a stable, pro-US and democratic Iraq by that time.

    	  
  	
    
      <p />
    	  
  	
    
      
The August 2002 material was obtained by the National Security Archive (NSA). Its officials said the plans were based on delusional assumptions.

    	  
  	
    
      <p />
    	  
  	
    
      
The US currently has some 132,000 troops in the violence-torn state.

      'Completely unrealistic'
    	  
  	
    
      </b>
    	  
  	
    
      <p />
    	  
  	
    
      
The documents -  in the former of PowerPoint slides - were prepared by the now-retired Gen Tommy Franks and other top commanders at the time.
<p />
    	  
  	
    
      
The documents were presented at a briefing in August 2002 - less than a year before the US invasion of Iraq in April 2003. 

    	  
  	
    
      <p />
    	  
  	
    
      
The commanders predicted that after the fighting was over there would be a two- to three-month "stabilisation" phase, followed by an 18- to 24-month "recovery" stage.

    	  
  	
    
      <p />
    	  
  	
    
      
They projected that the US forces would be almost completely "re-deployed" out of Iraq at the end of the "transition" phase - within 45 months of invasion. 

    	  
  	
    
      <p />
    	  
  	
    
      
"Completely unrealistic assumptions about a post-Saddam Iraq permeate these war plans," NSA executive director Thomas Blanton said in a statement posted on the organisation's website.

    	  
  	
    
      <p />

    	  
  	
    
      
"First, they assumed that a provisional government would be in place by 'D-Day', then that the Iraqis would stay in their garrisons and be reliable partners, and finally that the post-hostilities phase would be a matter of mere months'," Mr Blanton said.

    	  
  	
    
      <p />
    	  
  	
    
      
"All of these were delusions," he added. 

    	  
  	
    
      <p />
    	  
  	
    
      
The NSA said it received the documents last month, after making a request in 2004.

    	  
  	
    
      <p />
    	  
  	
    
      
The NSA is an independent research institute at George Washington University.

    	  
  	
    
      <p />
    	  
  	
    
      
It obtained the papers under the Freedom of Information Act.
