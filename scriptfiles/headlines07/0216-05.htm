WASHINGTON - Amid rising tensions between their two 
countries, a group of U.S. religious leaders will leave Saturday for 
meetings with Iranian clergy and political leaders, including President 
Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, in Tehran next week.Participants in the 13-member U.S. delegation, organised by the Mennonite 
Central Committee (MCC) and the Philadelphia-based American Friends 
Service Committee (AFSC), said their purpose will be to foster dialogue.
<br>
<br>
"We are making this trip hoping it will encourage both governments to step 
back from a course that will lead to conflict and suffering," said Mary 
Ellen McNish, general secretary of the AFSC.
<br><br>
Hostility between the two nations reached new heights recently as U.S. 
President George W. Bush this week renewed accusations that Iranian 
intelligence is supplying bombs to anti-U.S. militias in Iraq, and 
continued to build up its military forces in Iraq and the Gulf.
<br><br>

The weeklong visit will attempt to build on a New York meeting last 
September between U.S. religious leaders and Ahmadinejad, in which the 
harsh language between the two countries formed a central part of the 
discussion.
<br><br>
In response to a question regarding the slogan of certain Iranian 
protesters, "Death to America," the Iranian president said, "There was no 
cause for anger as they are not addressed to the American nation but to 
the aggressive, unjust, warmongering and bullying U.S. policies."
<br><br>
Ahmadinejad himself, however, has become a focus of enormous controversy 
as a result of his questioning of the Holocaust.
<br><br>
"As we did at the meeting in New York, we intend to continue to engage the 
president on his statements regarding the Holocaust," said McNish. "The 
Holocaust is a historical fact and one of history's greatest human 
tragedies."
<br><br>
At the same time, however, the organisers expressed the hope that their 
meeting with Ahmadinejad would not dominate the media attention on their 
trip.
<br><br>
"There is a great risk that our goal to encourage improved relations 
between the people of Iran and the U.S. will be overshadowed by 
controversy surrounding President Ahmadinejad," said Ron Flaming, 
international programme director of the MCC.
<br><br>
Although the group's schedule remains a secret for security reasons, the 
organisers expect to meet with former Iranian President Mohammad Khatami, 
Muslim and Christian religious leaders, and female members of parliament, 
the Majlis.
<br><br>
In addition, the organisers believe that the U.S. delegation will be 
allowed to meet with Ayatollah Taqi Mesbah-Yazdi who has been 
characterised as a close spiritual adviser of President Ahmadinejad, and 
an opponent of Iran's reformists. They will also meet with Iranian 
Evangelical Protestant leaders and the Archbishop of the Armenian Orthodox 
Church in Iran.
<br><br>
"We think it is important to connect with a range of people in Iran, and 
that's why we included the various groupings of people we have," Flaming 
told IPS. "So while the president is an important piece, that's not the 
only reason we're going. We're religious people going to establish bridges 
with Iranian people. We are not politicians."

<br><br>
Following the trip, the delegation will meet with members of the U.S. 
Congress to share its findings and discuss ways to reduce tensions between 
the two countries.
<br><br>
"We are hearing new concerns from members of Congress about President 
Bush's escalating confrontation with Iran and President Ahmadinejad's 
escalating confrontation with the U.S.," said Joe Volk, executive director 
of the Friends Committee on National Legislation, and a member of the 
delegation.
<br><br>
Despite growing calls in Congress for the Bush administration to engage 
Iran diplomatically, the White House has so far ruled out any negotiation 
until Tehran freezes its enrichment of uranium, a key part of its nuclear 
programme.
<br><br>
Iran's refusal so far to do so, as well as Bush's recent charges of Iran's 
intervention in Iraq, has fueled tensions between the two countries. Iran 
insists that its enrichment programme is permitted under the 
Non-Proliferation Treaty.
<br><br>
The FCNL's representative on the delegation stressed that the Quaker group 
opposes all efforts toward nuclear proliferation.<br>
