<p>WHITEFIELD -- A 60-year-old Whitefield artist is one of 13 antiwar activists trying to turn up the heat on U.S. Rep. Tom Allen, Maine's 1st District congressman.

<p>Natasha Mayers of Whitefield signed a letter Sunday that challenges Allen to explain why he is seeking to have a group calling itself the Bath-Brunswick Occupation Project Affinity Group banned from his Portland office.

<p>Mayers is a member of that group.

<p>The 13 activists -- all of whom signed the letter -- were arrested Feb. 21 on trespassing charges when they conducted a sit-in at Allen's Portland office to protest the Iraq war and new funding for 20,000 additional U.S. troops.

<p>"You can't say you're against war and then fund it," said Mayers, explaining that she respects Allen but wants the Democratic congressman to work harder to end the war. "He has been vocally opposed to the war, but every time, he has voted for funding the war."

<p>After her arrest, Mayers said she opted to pay a $40 fee rather than spend a night in jail. She had to be at work the next day, teaching at Linc Social Club in Augusta and the Waterville Social Club, both shelters for adults with mental disabilities.

<p>The letter, addressed to Allen, questions why Portland police have been asked to enforce the ban, citing the group's Constitutional right of "speech, assembly and petition for redress of grievances."

<p>Mark Sullivan, the congressman's Portland spokesman, acknowledged Monday he had received the letter but said he hadn't discussed it with Allen and could not comment on it.

<p>Sullivan said Allen has been outspoken in his opposition to the war and supports total withdrawal of all U.S. troops in Iraq by the end of the year.

<p>"Tom strongly opposes this war," Sullivan said. "He believes it was a mistake."

<p>He explained that Allen thinks Iraqi leaders will not stand up and take responsibility for their nation until U.S. forces pull out.

<p>However, Allen has said he will not decide on whether to vote for or against a supplemental appropriations bill -- part of which could support the war -- until he sees the legislation.

<p>Calling themselves "people of conscience," the letter-writers say their decision to hold a sit-in was "considered and deliberate, and we have no cause for regret. Our attempt to get through to you on that day, to move you in mind and heart, was our way of honoring those who have suffered and died in Iraq and at home as the result of ongoing U.S. aggression and occupation."

<p>"We listened to them," Sullivan said. "We talked to them."

<p>But when the activists sat on the floor among staff workers' desks, constituent confidentiality was jeopardized, he said.

<p>He said the office stayed open extra hours to accommodate the protesters, but finally, when the activists refused to leave the office, police were notified.

<p>"Our staff is on the phone taking people's Social Security numbers, private, confidential information. We do have to protect the rights of the other people who use this office," Sullivan said, pointing out there are some 600,000 residents in the 1st District.

<p>One of those constituents is Mayers' fellow protester Dexter Kamilewicz, who campaigned as an independent for Allen's seat last November on an antiwar platform. His son has served in Iraq.

<p>The activists are asking Allen to clarify whether or not they are welcome at his Portland office. Those contacted said they will plead not guilty to the trespassing charges.
