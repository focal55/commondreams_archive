<p>The War on Terror has radicalised Muslims around the world to unprecedented
 levels of anti-American feeling, according to the largest survey of Muslims
 ever to be conducted.
</p><p>
Seven per cent believe that the events of 9/11 were &ldquo;completely justified&rdquo;. In
 Saudi Arabia, 79 per cent had an &ldquo;unfavourable view&rdquo; of the US.

</p><p>
Gallup&rsquo;s Centre for Muslim Studies in New York carried out surveys of 10,000
 Muslims in ten predominantly Muslim countries. One finding was that the
 wealthier and better-educated the Muslim was, the more likely he was to be
 radicalised.
</p><p>
The surveys were carried out in 2005 and 2006. Along with an earlier Gallup
 survey in nine other countries in 2001, they represent the views of more
 than 90 per cent of the world&rsquo;s Muslims. A further 1,500 Muslims in London,
 Paris and Berlin are involved in a separate poll to be published in April.
</p><!--#include file="m63-article-related-attachements.html"--> 
<p>
The findings come in a climate of growing mistrust between Islam and the West.
 Another recent survey in the US found that 39 per cent of Americans felt
 some prejudice towards Muslims.
</p><p>
The Gallup findings indicate that, in terms of spiritual values and the
 emphasis on the family and the future, Americans have more in common with
 Muslims than they do with their Western counterparts in Europe.
</p><p>
A large number of Muslims supported the Western ideal of democratic
 government. Fifty per cent of radicals supported democracy, compared with 35
 per cent of moderates.
</p><p>
Religion was found to have little to do with radicalisation or antipathy
 towards Western culture. Muslims were condemnatory of promiscuity and a
 sense of moral decay. What they admired most was liberty, its democratic
 system, technology and freedom of speech.
</p><p>

While there was widespread support for Sharia, or Islamic law, only a minority
 wanted religious leaders to be making laws. Most women in the predominantly
 Muslim countries believed that Sharia should be the source of a nation&rsquo;s
 laws, but they strongly believed in equal rights for women.
</p><p>
This finding indicates the complexity of the struggle ahead for Western
 understanding. Few Western commentators can see how women could embrace the
 veil, Sharia and equal rights at the same time.
</p><p>
Researchers set out to examine the truth behind the stock response in the West
 to the question of when it will know it is winning the war on terror.
 Foreign policy experts tend to believe that victory will come when the
 Islamic world rejects radicalism. &ldquo;Every politician has a theory: radicals
 are religious fundamentalists; they are poor; they are full of hopeless-ness
 and hate. But those theories are wrong,&rdquo; the researchers reported.
</p><p>
&ldquo;We find that Muslim radicals have more in common with their moderate brethren
 than is often assumed. If the West wants to reach the extremists, and
 empower the moderate majority, it must first recognise who it&rsquo;s up against.&rdquo;
</p><p>
Gallup says that because terrorists often hijack Islamic precepts for their
 own ends, pundits and politicians in the West sometimes portray Islam as a
 religion of terrorism.
</p><p>
&ldquo;They often charge that religious fervour triggers radical and violent views,&rdquo;

 said John Esposito, a religion professor, and Dalia Mogahed, Gallup&rsquo;s Muslim
 studies director, in one analysis. &ldquo;But the data say otherwise. There is no
 significant difference in religiosity between moderates and radicals. In
 fact, radicals are no more likely to attend religious services regularly
 than are moderates.&rdquo;
</p><p>
They continue: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no secret that many in the Muslim world suffer from
 crippling poverty and lack of education. But are radicals any poorer than
 their fellow Muslims? We found the opposite: there is indeed a key
 difference between radicals and moderates when it comes to income and
 education, but it is the radicals who earn more and stay in school longer.&rdquo;
</p><p>
In fact, the surveys found that the radicals were more satisfied with their
 finances and quality of life than moderates.
</p><p>
Genieve Abdo, a senior Gallup analyst and author of <i>Mecca and Main Street:
 Muslim Life in America After 9/11,</i> said that the findings of a high
 level of religious belief among both moderate and radical Muslims had &ldquo;huge
 implications&rdquo; for Western governments.

</p><p>
She said: &ldquo;We have to assume that these Islamic parties and movements that are
 coming to power are popular and have a large constituency. People are not
 just voting for a party, they are voting for a religion, a way of life.&rdquo;
</p><p>
She said that the Gallup findings countered the argument that, for example, a
 vote for Hamas was a vote against the former Palestinian government of
 Arafat rather than a vote for the extreme religious position of the new
 government.
