<p>A weekend announcement by Halliburton, the US oil services giant, that it is shifting its corporate headquarters to Dubai from Texas triggered an angry response from some US lawmakers Monday.</p>
<p>


Halliburton, which was once run by Vice President Dick Cheney, said Sunday it was relocating to the United Arab Emirates to capitalize on the region's booming energy market.</p>
<p>

&quot;It's an example of corporate greed at its worst,&quot; Democratic Senator Patrick Leahy, chairman of the powerful Senate Judiciary Committee, said in a statement.</p>
<p>

&quot;This is an insult to the US soldiers and taxpayers who paid the tab for their no-bid contracts and endured their overcharges for all these years,&quot; he charged.</p>

<p>

&quot;At the same time they'll be avoiding US taxes, I'm sure they won't stop insisting on taking their profits in cold hard US cash.&quot;</p>
<p>

Halliburton and its former KBR subsidiary, which it is spinning off, have weathered several contracting controversies and investigations since Halliburton was awarded a no-bid 2.4 billion dollar contract to supply the US military on the eve of the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003.</p>
<p>

KBR agreed last year to pay the US government eight million dollars to settle fraud claims related to an Army supply contract.</p>
<p>




Halliburton said it was relocating to Dubai on business grounds. The firm said that over 38 percent of its 13 billion dollar oil-field services revenue was generated from the eastern hemisphere.</p>
<p>


It also said its move to the United Arab Emirates was the next step in a strategic plan unveiled in 2006 to boost its business with national oil companies in and around the Gulf region.</p>
<p>

Karen Lightfoot, a spokeswoman for Democratic Congressman Henry Waxman, said the lawmaker might convene a hearing in the House of Representatives over Halliburton's announcement.</p>
<p>

&quot;This is a surprising development. I want to understand the ramifications for the US taxpayer and national security,&quot; Waxman, the chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, said in a statement.</p>

<p>

Halliburton's chief executive, Dave Lesar, will move his office from Houston, Texas to Dubai in a bid to oversee a ramped-up bid to gain more regional oil services contracts and other related business.</p>
<p>

Weekend press reports said Halliburton still intended to keep its US legal registration, but a company spokesperson could not be reached to confirm this.</p>
<p>

The global firm has operations in 70 countries and more than 45,000 employees.</p>
