<p>WASHINGTON - After several weeks of internal wrangling, the 
Democratic leadership in the House of Representatives Thursday proposed 
legislation that, if enacted, would require all U.S. combat troops in Iraq 
to be withdrawn by Oct. 1, 2008.</p>

        <!--/endimage/--> The measure, which will take the form of an amendment to a pending 100- 
billion-dollar supplemental defence appropriations bill, also requires 
President George W. Bush to begin such a withdrawal as early as July of 
this year unless he certifies that the government of Iraqi Prime Minister 
Nouri al-Maliki is making progress toward achieving national 
reconciliation and ending sectarian violence there.</p>

<p>The proposed amendment, the first concrete effort to set a specific 
timetable for a U.S. withdrawal, faces an uncertain future. With all but a 
handful of Republican lawmakers likely to oppose it, House Speaker Nancy 
Pelosi will have to rally her party's right- and left-wing factions in 
order to ensure its passage.</p>

<p>Several leading Democrats in the U.S. Senate also introduced a joint 
resolution Thursday that contains binding language directing the president 
to begin the phased redeployment of U.S. troops in Iraq within 120 days 
with a goal of redeploying all combat forces by Mar. 31, 2008 -- although 
Senate Republicans have twice blocked the Senate from even debating the 
administration's policies in Iraq.</p>

<p>The Democratic Party's "Progressive Caucus", which currently makes up 
about one-fifth of House Democrats, released its own proposed amendment 
Thursday. It called for a complete withdrawal of all U.S. forces from Iraq 
no later than by the end of this year.</p>

<p>"We are a caucus and we will come together and find our common ground," 
said Pelosi when asked about prospects for maintaining unity among 
Democrats. "I believe in the end we will be unified," she added.</p>

<p>Even if she succeeds, however, the proposed amendment would still have to 
be reconciled with any version of the supplemental appropriations bill 
approved by the Senate, whose leadership is still hashing out its terms, 
and overcome a likely veto by Bush who has rejected any proposal, 
including one by the bipartisan Iraq Study Group (ISG), to set a timetable 
or deadline for the withdrawal of U.S. troops.</p>

<p>Indeed, the House Minority Leader, Rep. John Boehner, immediately attacked 
the proposed amendment, insisting that it would compromise all chances for 
success in Iraq by "establishing and telegraphing to our enemy a 
timetable" for withdrawal. Echoing the White House, he added that the new 
commander of U.S. forces in Iraq, Gen. David Petraeus, "should be the one 
making the decisions on what happens on the ground..."
</p>

<p>The proposed amendment was finally agreed nearly three weeks after 17 
Republicans joined all but two Democrats in the House to approve a 
non-binding resolution that formally disapproved of Bush's decision to add 
some 29,000 troops to the 140,000-troop force that is currently deployed 
in Iraq.</p>

<p>Having gone on record as opposed to the latest escalation -- or "surge" --  
in Washington's intervention, however, Democrats have found it much more 
difficult to agree on whether, and how, to put real teeth into their 
policy views by passing binding legislation that would force Bush to 
comply with their wishes.</p>

<p>While its "Out-of-Iraq Caucus", which constitutes about one-third of House 
Democrats, argued that the results of last November's elections gave the 
party a mandate to force a swift withdrawal, the party's leadership 
worried that such a move would alienate its more-conservative members, the 
so-called "Blue-Dog Democrats".</p>

<p>The Blue Dogs, who hail from districts -- particularly in the South, the 
Southwest and Midwestern states -- that normally vote Republican, are 
considered particularly vulnerable to administration attacks that they are 
"soft on defence" or not providing adequate support to soldiers in the 
field.</p>

<p>They balked, in particular, at a proposal by Rep. John Murtha, the 
powerful and normally hawkish chairman of the subcommittee on defence 
appropriations whose outspoken opposition to the war has been spurred by 
concern that U.S. land forces have become dangerously over-stretched, to 
include specific readiness and training requirements for troops deployed 
to Iraq that would have made Bush's "surge" plan impossible to carry out.</p>

<p>The bill to which the amendment is to be attached is Bush's request for 
nearly 100 billion dollars to continue to fund military operations in Iraq 
and Afghanistan through the end of fiscal 2007, next Sep. 30.</p>

<p>Because the more than 60 billion dollars already appropriated for 2007 is 
fast running out -- war-related costs in both countries are running at 
some 12 billion dollars a month -- the supplemental bill has been given a 
high priority in the legislative calendar. Pelosi said she hoped it would 
clear the Appropriations Committee next week so that a floor vote could 
take place by the end of the month.</p>

<p>The amendment would actually add four billion dollars to Bush's original 
request, including one billion dollars for U.S. operations in Afghanistan 
where both lawmakers and the administration appear increasingly concerned 
about a resurgence of the Taliban.</p>

<p>
The proposed amendment also attempts to incorporate some of the key 
recommendations of the ISG, which was co-chaired by former Secretary of 
State James Baker and former Democratic Rep. Lee Hamilton.</p>

<p>The ISG, which released its report in early December, had called for all 
combat forces to be redeployed from Iraq by Mar. 31, 2008; the Democratic 
amendment puts that deadline off for an additional six months.</p>

<p>The ISG had also called for Washington to reduce its aid to Iraq if the 
Maliki government failed to demonstrate real progress in achieving 
national reconciliation.</p>

<p>Under the Democrats' proposal, Baghdad's failure to make progress on 
achieving certain "political benchmarks", such as the enactment of laws 
that would ensure equitable regional distribution of Iraq's oil revenues 
and the adoption of amendments to the constitution designed to boost the 
voice of the Sunni population, which largely boycotted elections to the 
country's constituent assembly. If Bush fails to certify that such 
progress is being made by Jul. 1, 2007 and again by Oct. 1, 2007, he must 
withdraw all U.S. combat forces over the following six months.</p>

<p>The amendment also explicitly prohibits the establishment of permanent 
U.S. bases in Iraq, which was another major recommendation by the ISG and 
also forbids "the initiation of offensive military actions against Iran, 
except when such operations are authorised by (Congress)..."</p>

<p>It also imposes, as Murtha first proposed, a number of requirements 
regarding the readiness, training, and rotation of U.S. forces deployed to 
Iraq, but permits Bush to "waive" them under certain circumstances.</p>

<p>The amendment disappointed some anti-war activists who have rallied behind 
the ISG's withdrawal timetable or an even shorter period, coupled with an 
intensified negotiations process both within Iraq and among its 
neighbours, as also called for by the ISG.</p>

<p>"Congress has failed to realize the message of the Baker-Hamilton report, 
that only a political process is going to solve the problem," said Joe 
Volk, director of the Friends Committee on National Legislation. "You 
can't keep voting billions and billions of dollars in additional funds for 
the same failed policy when you know that it has failed."
