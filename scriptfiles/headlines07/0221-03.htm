<p>Factory farms are responsible for both 
the bird flu and emissions of greenhouse gases that now top those of cars 
and sport utility vehicles (SUVs), according to a report released Monday.
</b></p>
Sixty percent of global livestock production, including chicken and pig 
"confined animal feedlot operations" (CAFOs), now occur in the developing 
world. Unregulated zoning and subsidies that encourage these CAFOs or 
factory farms are moving closer to major urban areas in China, Bangladesh, 
India, and many countries in Africa, said the report, "Vital Signs 
2007-2008" by the Worldwatch Institute.
<br><br>
Although there is no definitive scientific proof, those farms are very 
likely where avian or bird flu started and will continue to be responsible 
for new outbreaks, said the author of the report, Danielle Nierenberg, a 
Worldwatch research associate.
<br><br>
In Laos, 42 of the 45 outbreaks of avian flu in the spring of 2004 
occurred on factory farms, and 38 were in the capital, Vientiane. In 
Nigeria, the first cases of avian flu were found in an industrial broiler 
operation. It spread from that 46,000-bird farm to 30 other factory farms, 
then quickly to neighbouring backyard flocks, forcing already poor farmers 
to kill their chickens, Nierenberg writes in the report.

<br><br>
"The growth in factory farms in the developing world is being driven by 
the fact that there are more people in cities and they have more money to 
buy meat," she told IPS in an interview.
<br><br>
Rising incomes, populations and demand for meat has resulted in the global 
poultry population quadrupling since the 1960s to about 18 billion birds 
today. Once mostly raised under free-range conditions or in backyards by 
very small producers, most poultry are now kept in large flocks numbering 
several hundred thousand.
<br><br>
Cramming 100,000 chickens into a single facility to produce low-cost meat 
also creates the perfect atmosphere for the spread of disease. For that 
very reason intensive livestock production systems in Europe and North 
America feed large volumes of antibiotics to chickens, pigs and cows to 
control diseases. This widespread use of antibiotics has created bacteria 
that are now resistant to antibiotics and pose yet another human health 
threat.
<br><br>
Avian flu is a virus, but one that has long been present in wild and 
domestic birds and is normally harmless to humans. In 2003, a deadly 
strain called H5N1 evolved, and has now killed 167 people, according to 
the World Health Organisation.
<br><br>
Last month, England experienced its first outbreak of H5N1 at a huge 
turkey farm with 160,000 birds and a meat processing facility. Infected 
turkey meat believed to have been shipped in from the company's factory 
farms in Hungary is thought to be the original source of the disease, 
according to British officials.
<br><br>
On Monday, Russian health officials confirmed an H5N1 strain outbreak in 
five different regions around Moscow. Officials there blamed migrating 
wild birds even though it is the middle of winter in Russia. Russia's 
Novosti news agency said scientists traced the source of the virus to a 
pet market in Moscow.
<br><br>
The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) in Rome and the 
WHO have also blamed wild birds and backyard flocks for the spread of the 
virus. As a result, at least 15 nations have restricted or banned 
free-range and backyard production of birds.
<br><br>
But that may do more harm than good, said Nierenberg.
<br><br>

"Many of the world's estimated 800 million urban farmers, who raise crops 
and animals for food, transportation, and income in back yards and on 
rooftops, have been targeted unfairly," she said in a statement. "The 
socioeconomic importance of livestock to the world's poor cannot be 
overstated."
<br><br>
There is mounting evidence that there are other vectors of the disease. No 
wild birds have been detected with the virus in Europe or Africa this 
winter, yet there have been outbreaks in Nigeria, Egypt and Europe. 
Illegal and improper trade in poultry is thought to be the reason for 
these outbreaks.
<br><br>
"Our research shows that the global poultry trade and migratory birds are 
involved in the spread of H5N1," said Peter Daszak, executive director of 
the Consortium for Conservation Medicine in New York and an expert on the 
spread of disease in wildlife.
<br><br>
The combination of large numbers of birds being raised together, the 
international trade in poultry and migratory birds are a perfect receipt 
for the global spread of disease, Daszak said in an interview.
<br><br>
However, there is a "bit of blame game going on" as some cite factory 
farms and others migratory birds as the source of H5N1.
<br><br>
"New diseases are one of the costs of development and growth," he said.
<br><br>
Daszak and colleagues have documented the rise of various diseases such as 
Ebola, BSE, CJD, HIV/AIDS, and H5N1 bird flu, and believe they are the 
result of environmental change, which is almost always caused by humans. 
Because humans share so many pathogens with animals, humans' impact in 
driving wildlife diseases in turn threatens public health.
<br><br>
"Many of us at the outset underestimated the role of trade," Samuel Jutzi, 
director of Animal Production and Health at the FAO, told the 
International Herald Tribune last week.
<br><br>
"The poultry sector is the most globalised in agriculture," Jutzi said. 
"There is incredible movement of chicks and other products."

<br><br>
The pathogenic H5N1 form of avian flu does not usually develop in wild 
birds or backyard poultry because their populations are too spread out and 
diverse, said Cathy Holtslander, project organiser for the Beyond Factory 
Farming Coalition, a Canadian NGO.
<br><br>
Concentrating huge numbers of animals in small spaces, feeding them the 
cheapest food possible, centralising and speeding up processing, and 
distributing the product widely around the world is the perfect recipe for 
spreading disease, Holtslander told IPS.
<br><br>
The growing numbers of livestock around the world are responsible for 18 
percent of global greenhouse gas emissions (as measured in carbon dioxide 
equivalent), according to the FAO. It's not just methane and manure -- the 
FAO shows that land-use changes, especially deforestation to expand 
pastures and to create arable land for feed crops, is a big part. So is 
the use of energy to produce fertilisers, to run the slaughterhouses and 
meat-processing plants, and to pump water.
<br><br>
Already surpassing emissions from the world's transportation sector, 
livestock numbers are rising fast.
<br><br>
"The world's poor probably need more meat, but we in North America and 
Europe should eat a lot less meat," said Nierenberg.
<br><br>
And it would be better and healthier to get meat from small-scale, 
localised production systems. Factory farms provide cheap meat only 
because the real costs in terms of air and water pollution, terrible 
conditions for workers and animals and so on are not factored in, she 
said.
<br><br>
"The U.S. infrastructure can barely handle the problems caused by factory 
farms," Nierenberg said. "I don't know how they can address these in the 
developing world."
