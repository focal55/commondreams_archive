<p>Hundreds of liberal activists are expected to pack the pews tonight
at the Broad Street Presbyterian Church in Columbus, Ohio, to protest a
Bush administration plan. It has nothing to do with Iraq. It is about
rules governing how many properties media companies should be allowed
to own in local markets</p>

<p>Kevin Martin, the Republican chairman
of the Federal Communications Commission, wants to loosen existing
ownership limits on newspapers and broadcasters to allow them to own
both in most markets. But his efforts have stalled, the result of a
surprisingly energetic grass-roots opposition campaign guided by <a href="http://www.freepress.net/" target="_new">Free
Press</a>, a nonprofit with offices in Washington and Northampton, Mass</p>

<p>“Such
changes could have a serious impact on the diversity of viewpoints and
coverage of local issues in every community,” the group argues in
fliers and an Internet site under its “<a href="http://www.stopbigmedia.com" target="_new">STOP BIG MEDIA</a>” campaign</p>

<p>For
a relatively low-profile organization, Free Press is on a roll. Four
years ago, it used old-fashioned grassroots organizing, along with
basic Internet tools, to help derail the FCC’s years-long effort to
relax media ownership rules. Last year, the group thwarted a
multi-million dollar lobbying effort by the Baby Bells to rewrite the
nation’s telecom laws over “net neutrality,” the idea that Internet
providers can’t discriminate against any Internet traffic</p>

<p>Progressive,
left-leaning grass-roots activists have gotten more attention for their
opposition against the Iraq war, but their bigger impact may have been
on national media regulations and telecom policies. By mobilizing the
progressive left to focus on media and telecom issues, Free Press has
effectively blocked some of the most-wanted issues on corporate
wish-lists</p>

<p>The Free Press success is all the more remarkable,
given the array of big-name media companies pushing for change.
Technology has changed the competitive landscape, said a coalition of
media firms — including Belo Corp., CBS Corp., News Corp.’s Fox
Entertainment Group and NBC Universal Inc. — in a December letter
lobbying the FCC to ease the rules. The FCC “should modernize its local
ownership rules to reflect these dynamic changes in the media
marketplace,” they say</p>

<p>Media reformers have been working on
these issues for years, but “they’ve never had traction among
grass-roots America before,” says Mike McCurry, former press secretary
for President Clinton. Mr. McCurry drew scorn from left-leaning
bloggers last year after he helped launch a public-relations effort on
behalf of phone companies hoping to kill net-neutrality rules</p>

<p>Free
Press, which launched in 2003, has 300,000 members, about two dozen
full-time employees and an annual budget of roughly $2.5 million. Last
year, it raised more than $5 million in funding, mostly from
liberal-leaning private foundations, including George Soros’s Open
Society Institute. In 2005, almost half of its funding — $755,000 — came from the Schumann Center for Media and Democracy, which at the
time was overseen by its president, journalist Bill Moyers. This year,
the group is hoping to raise $4.5 million and wants to hire more
grass-roots organizers</p>

<p>It is raising its ambitions as well.
After stymieing efforts to loosen media rules, Free Press members
believe they may be on the verge of changing the terms of the debate — to tightening regulations again</p>

<p>“We’re going to use this opportunity to move the goal posts,” says Josh Silver, Free Press co-founder and executive director</p>

<p>Unlike
other watchdog groups that have focused on telecom and media-reform
issues in the past, Free Press has successfully tapped into the
grass-roots network dominated by MoveOn.org</p>

<p>“We just have to
remind them to talk about media reform, not the war,” says Amanda
Ballantyne, Free Press’s field organizer who is in charge of getting
people to show up tonight for the Columbus hearing, the 11th on the
subject in the past two years. She helps coordinate similar events
around the country, rounding up locals and tutoring them on the basics
of media-ownership limits</p>

<p>Recently, Ms. Ballantyne holed up at
a Nashville Best Western for a week, trying to convince locals to
attend an official FCC media-ownership hearing. With the help of local
organizers, nearly 400 people showed up. Even with a strictly enforced
two-minute time limit, it took seven hours for the FCC commissioners to
listen to everyone</p>

<p>In February, the group attracted more than
3,000 activists and bloggers to Memphis for three days of workshops and
speeches from progressive and liberal heroes, including the Rev. Jesse
Jackson and Mr. Moyers</p>

<p>“If you watch TV news, it’s all car
crashes, shootings and Brangelina. If we can’t create more hard-hitting
journalism, then we have a real problem,” says Mr. Silver, a political
activist who says he decided to form the group after becoming mad one
night when a local newscast led with a story about the rising price of
lobster. Local ownership of stations or newspapers leads to more
accountability to citizens and better journalism, he says</p>

<p>With
the help of University of Illinois professor and media critic Robert
McChesney, Mr. Silver soon launched a nonprofit group dedicated to
media reform</p>

<p>The current FCC chairman, Mr. Martin, had hoped to
propose easing rules this year which would allow media companies to own
newspapers and broadcast stations in most markets. But that proposal
will have to wait until next year at least, FCC officials say. The
agency will hold at least three more public hearings around the country
and is awaiting 10 studies it commissioned on media-ownership issues,
which have already cost more than $550,000.
