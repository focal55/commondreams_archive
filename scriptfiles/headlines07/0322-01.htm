The irony here is that the growing eagerness to slow climate change by 
using biofuels and planting millions of trees for carbon credits has 
resulted in new major causes of deforestation, say activists. And that is 
making climate change worse because deforestation puts far more greenhouse 
gases into the atmosphere than the entire world's fleet of cars, trucks, 
planes, trains and ships combined.
<br>
<br>
"Biofuels are rapidly becoming the main cause of deforestation in 
countries like Indonesia, Malaysia and Brazil," said Simone Lovera, 
managing coordinator of the <a href="http://www.wrm.org.uy/GFC/" target="_new">Global Forest Coalition</a>, an environmental NGO 
based in Asunción, Paraguay.
<br>
<br>
"We call it 'deforestation diesel'," Lovera told IPS.

<br><br>
Oil from African palm trees is considered to be one of the best and 
cheapest sources of biodiesel and energy companies are investing billions 
into acquiring or developing oil-palm plantations in developing countries. 
Vast tracts of forest in Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and many other 
countries have been cleared to grow oil palms.
<br><br>
Oil palm has become the world's number one fruit crop, well ahead of 
bananas.
<br><br>
Biodiesel offers many environmental benefits over diesel from petroleum, 
including reductions in air pollutants, but the enormous global thirst 
means millions more hectares could be converted into monocultures of oil 
palm.
<br><br>
Getting accurate numbers on how much forest is being lost is very 
difficult.
<br><br>
The FAO's <a href="http://www.fao.org/docrep/009/a0773e/a0773e00.htm" target="_new"><i>State of the World's Forests 2007</i></a> released last week reports 
that globally, net forest loss is 20,000 hectares per day -- equivalent to 
an area twice the size of Paris. However, that number includes plantation 
forests, which masks the actual extent of tropical deforestation, about 
40,000 hectares (ha) per day, says Matti Palo, a forest economics expert 
who is affiliated with the Tropical Agricultural Research and Higher 
Education Center (CATIE) in Costa Rica.
<br>
<br>
"The half a million ha per year deforestation of Mexico is covered by the 
increase of forests in the U.S., for example," Palo told IPS.
<br><br>
National governments provide all the statistics, and countries like Canada 
do not produce anything reliable, he said. Canada has claimed no net 
change in its forests for 15 years despite being the largest producer of 
pulp and paper.
<br><br>
"Canada has a moral responsibility to tell the rest of the world what kind 
of changes have taken place there," he said.
<br><br>

Plantation forests are nothing like natural or native forests. More akin 
to a field of maize, plantation forests are hostile environments to nearly 
every animal, bird and even insects. Such forests have been shown to have 
a negative impact on the water cycle because non-native, fast-growing 
trees use high volumes of water. Pesticides are also commonly used to 
suppress competing growth from other plants and to prevent disease 
outbreaks, also impacting water quality.
<br><br>
Plantation forests also offer very few employment opportunities, resulting 
in a net loss of jobs.
<br><br>
"Plantation forests are a tremendous disaster for biodiversity and local 
people," Lovera said.
<br><br>
Even if  farmland or savanna are only used for oil palm or other 
plantations, it often forces the local people off the land and into nearby 
forests, including national parks, which they clear to grow crops, pasture 
animals and collect firewood. That has been the pattern with pulp and 
timber plantation forests in much of the world, says Lovera.
<br><br>
Ethanol is other major biofuel, which is made from maize, sugar cane or 
other crops. As prices for biofuels climb, more land is cleared to grow 
the crops. U.S. farmers are switching from soy to maize to meet the 

ethanol demand. That is having a knock on effect of pushing up soy prices, 
which is driving the conversion of the Amazon rainforest into soy, she 
says.
<br><br>
Meanwhile rich countries are starting to plant trees to offset their 
emissions of carbon dioxide, called carbon sequestration. Most of this 
planting is taking place in the South in the form of plantations, which 
are just the latest threat to existing forests.
<br><br>
"Europe's carbon credit market could be disastrous," Lovera said.
<br><br>
The multi-billion-euro European carbon market does not permit the use of 
reforestation projects for carbon credits. But there has been a tremendous 
surge in private companies offering such credits for tree planting 
projects. Very little of this money goes to small land holders, she says.
<br><br>
Plantation forests also contain much less carbon, notes Palo, citing a 
recent study that showed carbon content of plantation forests in some 
Asian tropical countries was only 45 percent of that in the respective 
natural forests.

<br><br>
Nor has the world community been able to properly account for the value of 
the enormous volumes of carbon stored in existing forests.
<br><br>
One recent estimate found that the northern Boreal forest provided 250 
billion dollars a year in ecosystem services such as absorbing carbon 
emissions from the atmosphere and cleaning water.
<br><br>
The good news is that deforestation, even in remote areas, is easily 
stopped. All it takes is access to some low-cost satellite imagery and 
governments that actually want to slow or halt deforestation.
<br><br>
Costa Rica has nearly eliminated deforestation by making it illegal to 
convert forest into farmland, says Lovera.
<br><br>
Paraguay enacted similar laws in 2004, and then regularly checked 
satellite images of its forests, sending forestry officials and police to 
enforce the law where it was being violated.
<br><br>
"Deforestation has been reduced by 85 percent in less than two years in 
the eastern part of the country," Lovera noted.
<br><br>
The other part of the solution is to give control over forests to the 
local people. This community or model forest concept has proved to be 
sustainable in many parts of the world. India recently passed a bill 
returning the bulk of its forests back to local communities for 
management, she said.
<br><br>
However, economic interests pushing deforestation in countries like Brazil 
and Indonesia are so powerful, there may eventually be little natural 
forest left.
<br><br>

"Governments are beginning to realize that their natural forests have 
enormous value left standing," Lovera said. "A moratorium or ban on 
deforestation is the only way to stop this."
