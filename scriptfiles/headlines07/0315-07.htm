<p>Last Sunday, Pastor John Hagee, the 
founder of Christians United for Israel, received a rousing reception at 
the opening dinner plenary of the annual <a href="http://www.aipac.org/AIPAC_events/2552_2541.asp" target="_new">American Israel Public Affairs 
Committee (AIPAC)</a> conference.</p>

        <!--/endimage/--> Hagee warned the crowd that "Iran poses a nuclear threat to the state of 
Israel that promises nothing less than a nuclear Holocaust." Hagee claimed 
that the situation is like 1938, only "Iran is Germany and [President 
Mahmoud] Ahmedinejad is the new Hitler."</p>

<p>Hagee added: "We must stop Iran's nuclear threat and stop it now and stand 
boldly [with] Israel, the only democracy in the Middle East."</p>

<p>A few weeks earlier, Hagee had met with Senator John McCain, a leading 
contender for the Republican Party's 2008 presidential nomination. Hagee 
has been leading the charge of conservative Christian evangelicals urging 
President George W. Bush to deal more forcefully with Iran.
</p>

<p>"Hagee's appearance at AIPAC indicates the growing organizational strength 
of the Christian Zionist lobby for apocalyptic war and the rise of 
corresponding Jewish factions both within AIPAC and within Israeli 
politics that are pushing for dramatically expanded war in the Mideast," 
Bruce Wilson, the co-founder of <a href="http://www.talk2action.org/" target="_new">Talk To Action</a>, a website specializing on 
religion and politics, told IPS.</p>

<p>As the launching of the Iraq War approaches its fourth anniversary, it is 
worth remembering that during the lead-up to the invasion, a number of 
conservative evangelicals voiced their support for the war.</p>

<p>Richard Land, president of the Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission for 
the Southern Baptist Convention, the nation's largest Protestant 
denomination, maintained that Bush's action met criteria for a just war. 
The National Association of Evangelicals, which represents several dozen 
denominations encompassing more than 30 million U.S. evangelical 
Christians, openly supported the war. And Mike Evans, who heads the 
aggressively pro-Israeli Jerusalem Prayer Team, pointed out that war with 
Iraq could be a "dress rehearsal for Armageddon," the fulfillment of 
Biblical prophecy.</p>

<p>These days, while the Bush administration and beltway neoconservatives 
doggedly crank up the volume against Iran, they are again being joined by 
a number of significant conservative Christian evangelicals.</p>

<p>Hagee, pastor of the 18,000-member San Antonio, Texas-based Cornerstone 
Church and head of a multi-million-dollar evangelical enterprise, "seems 
to believe such a conflict is both inevitable and necessary," The Jewish 
Week noted in early March.</p>

<p>Founder of <a href="http://www.cufi.org/" target="_new">Christians United for Israel (CUFI)</a>, a Christian Zionist 
lobbying group created last year, Hagee is also the author of a number of 
Christian-themed novels, as well as the recent "Jerusalem Countdown: A 
Warning to the World," which maintains that biblical prophecy is currently 
playing itself out in the Middle East.</p>

<p>"The end of the world as we know it is rapidly approaching," Hagee wrote 
in "Jerusalem Countdown." "Just before us is a nuclear countdown with Iran 
followed by Ezekiel's war (as described in Ezekiel, chapters 38 and 39), 
and then the final battle -- the battle of Armageddon."</p>

<p>In a recent series of articles focused on Hagee, Talk to Action's Bruce 
Wilson described him as someone that "has built a career on aggressive 
support for hard right to fringe right Israeli politics and is now making 
inroads towards convincing the mainstream American Jewish community that 
he and CUFI are the best tactical allies Jews and Israel can expect to 
find."</p>

<p>
"Pastor John Hagee's warmly received AIPAC speech illustrates the extent 
to which political leaders who espouse ideology that in the 1960s was 
considered to be scandalously close the extreme end of the political 
spectrum can now expect to broadcast their views from a national stage," 
Wilson told IPS.</p>

<p>Joel Rosenberg is another conservative Christian evangelical advocating 
some type of military action against Iran. In late February, Rosenberg, 
who was raised in an Orthodox Jewish family, reported on his website that 
a number of conservative Christian evangelical leaders were beginning to 
show an interest in Iran, particularly as the situation in the Middle East 
relates to passages in the Bible.</p>

<p>Rosenberg's latest novel, "The Ezekiel Option," is "about the threat of a 
Russian-Iranian alliance to destroy Israel based on the Biblical 
prophecies found in the Book of Ezekiel, chapters 38 and 39." These 
prophecies "describe what Bible scholars call the war of Gog and Magog. 
Russia and Iran form a military alliance with Lebanon, Syria and a group 
of other Middle East countries to destroy Israel in what Ezekiel described 
as the last days."</p>

<p>In January, during a trip to the Middle East, Rosenberg said that he 
"brief[ed] several hundred Arab and Iranian pastors and evangelical 
leaders on the latest geopolitical developments in the region," and that 
he taught "on Ezekiel 38 and 39... prophecies that most Christian leaders 
in the region are unfamiliar with."</p>

<p>Back home, Rosenberg has discovered a growing interest in developments in 
Iran amongst prominent evangelical Christian leaders. While flying to New 
Mexico, he "happened to sit next to" Focus on the Family founder Dr. James 
Dobson, one of the most politically powerful conservative evangelical 
leaders in the U.S.</p>

<p>Dobson, who "had been in Washington for meetings with high-level 
administration officials to discuss Iran, Iraq and the latest developments 
in the Middle East," told Rosenberg that he was becoming more "concerned 
about the Iranian nuclear threat, and has been studying Ezekiel's 
prophecies."</p>

<p>"Will there be a war in the region this year or next?" While acknowledging 
that "it's too early to say," Rosenberg claimed that 2007 is "the Year of 
Decision." President Bush and Congressional leaders "will need to decide 
soon just how they're going to handle the Iranian nuclear threat, [and] 
Church leaders also need to decide just how they are going to handle the 
Iranian threat, as well ... after all, time is short, and the stakes are 
high."</p>

<p>Last July, at Christian United for Israel's coming out party in 
Washington, Hagee stated that "The United States must join Israel in a 
pre-emptive military strike against Iran to fulfill God's plan for both 
Israel and the West... a biblically prophesied end-time confrontation with 
Iran, which will lead to the Rapture, Tribulation [...] and [the] Second 
Coming of Christ."</p>

<p>In a statement given to IPS by Jane Hunter and Rabbi Haim Dov Beliak, 
co-founders of the website <a href="http://www.JewsOnFirst.org" target="_new">JewsOnFirst.org</a>, they said that "Hagee's call 
in his speech for victory for Israel and America (which appears to refer 
to Iran) is not necessarily the call for military victory which his 
audience might have heard (a chilling prospect nonetheless). Hagee's 
'victory' is coded language for Armageddon, which Christian Zionists see 
as the end-times battles set in Israel, when Christians are raptured to 
heaven and Jews lose -- unless they're happy to convert."
</p>

<p>If President Bush unleashes a pre-emptive military strike against Iran, 
there is little doubt that Pastor Hagee will be by his side.</p>
