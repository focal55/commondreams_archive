<p>  BAGHDAD - Reports of the gang-rape of 20-year-old Sabrine 
al-Janabi by three policemen has set off new demands for justice from 
Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki's government.
Janabi, who lives in the Hai al-Amil area of southern Baghdad with her 
husband, was taken from her home Feb. 18 to a police station and accused 
of assisting resistance fighters.
<br>
<br>
Janabi told al-Jazeera channel Feb. 19 that three police commandos raped 
her in the police garrison after accusing her of cooking for resistance 
fighters.
<br><br>
"One of them put his hand on my mouth so no one outside the room could 
hear me," she said in a videotaped statement. "I told them 'I did not know 
that an Iraqi could do this to another Iraqi'."

<br><br>
She said "I begged them not to rape me and I swore to them that I was a 
good woman and I am like a sister to them, but they did it one after the 
other."
<br><br>
Nouri al-Maliki's office issued a statement that medical evidence showed 
Janabi had not been raped. That statement has turned the event into a 
political crisis.
<br><br>
Janabi is Sunni, and the police predominantly Shia. Sunnis have long 
accused the police of using heavy-handed tactics against Sunnis during 
"security operations." But this incident appears to be highlighting 
widespread displeasure with the Iraqi government at least as much as 
stoking strained sectarian tensions.
<br><br>
Maliki's office described Janabi as "a liar" and recommended that the 
three accused policeman be commended, in response to demands for an 
independent investigation from both Shia and Sunni opposition groups.
<br><br>
The New York Times reported that an Iraqi nurse who says she treated 
Janabi saw signs of sexual and physical assault.
<br><br>
Stories of rape committed by both U.S. and Iraqi soldiers have appeared 
since the early days of the U.S. occupation of Iraq. The first stories 
emerged from inside Abu Ghraib prison. These, along with photographic 
evidence of sexual humiliation, provoked widespread anger across Iraq.
<br><br>
Rape victims in Iraq rarely come forward because they fear public scorn 
and humiliation. A Muslim woman who acknowledges being raped risks death 
at the hands of male relatives seeking to restore family honour.
<br><br>
Dr. Harith al-Dhari, secretary-general of the Sunni religious group The 
Association of Muslim Scholars, told reporters this week that rapes take 
place often, but victims are not coming forward to file complaints.
<br><br>

But since Janabi went public with her story, other stories of rape have 
begun to emerge.
<br><br>
On Feb. 22 a 50-year-old Sunni woman accused four Iraqi soldiers of raping 
her and attempting to rape her two daughters. She took her story to 
minister Izzidin Dola, who then brought the mayor of her city and a group 
of tribal chiefs to her home in order to take her statement.
<br><br>
"At least four police officers participated in that crime and they are 
facing legal procedures," Dola told IPS.
<br><br>
"The Iraqi police are following the example of those who trained them," 
Ahmed Mukhtar, a school headmaster in the northern Iraqi city Mosul told 
IPS. "American soldiers did it more than a thousand times and got away 
with it. They sentenced that soldier who killed Abeer after raping her 
with a hundred years imprisonment, but we Iraqis are not fools, and we 
know he will be on parole sooner than he hopes."
<br><br>
Mukhtar was referring to the gang rape of 14-year-old Abeer al-Janabi last 
year near Mahmudiya south of Baghdad. Janabi was then killed together with 
her parents and younger sister. Soldiers then burnt the bodies in an 
attempt to cover their crime.
<br><br>
Sgt. Paul E. Cortez, 24, was sentenced Feb. 23 to 100 years in prison, but 
is eligible for parole in 10 years. Cortez pleaded guilty to the rape and 
killing.
<br><br>
Iraqi resistance groups have issued statements declaring that the Iraqi 
police and soldiers involved in recent rapes would be given "proper 
punishment."
