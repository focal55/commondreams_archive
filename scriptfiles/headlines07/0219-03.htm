<p>Republican strategists fear that an increasingly anti-Bush and war-weary American public could deny the party the White House in 2008, frustrating the grand design of the party's political mastermind Karl Rove for a permanent majority.<P>"I believe Republicans are in a more dangerous position than at any time since 1974," said Frank Luntz, a Republican pollster and commentator. "Back then you had Watergate. You had economic recession, a military collapse in Vietnam and had civil unrest. All those same ingredients are present today."<P>Mr Luntz said his own polling and focus group research in the first two states in the primary process - Iowa and New Hampshire - had persuaded him that most Americans are hungry for a change. That desire, he believes, is unlikely to be met by the Republican candidates for 2008. "The Republican party seems to have lost the will to govern," he said.<P>Among the frontrunners, John McCain, the 70-year-old Vietnam war veteran, Arizona senator and maverick, is viewed by some as too old. Mr McCain could also be hurt by his strong support for a troops increase in Iraq, and his recent courtship of evangelical leaders whom he once denounced as "agents of intolerance".<P>While the former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani has been climbing in the polls since he declared his candidacy last week, the hero of the September 11 attacks has limited appeal to the social conservatives who are the bedrock of the party. The thrice-married mayor will have to perform his own ideological contortions to win over conservative Republicans who see him as too liberal on abortion, gay rights and stem cell research.<P>Mitt Romney, the former governor of Massachusetts who also made a formal announcement last week, hopes to capitalise on his can-do reputation as the successful chief executive officer who saved the Salt Lake City Olympics from scandal and financial ruin. But there are questions over whether the Christian right is prepared to back a Mormon, whose religion many of them regard as little more than a cult, and there is suspicion about whether his switch from a liberal position on social issues is genuine or tactical.<P>Against the Democratic star power of Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama, all three frontrunners and a second tier of largely conservative candidates have left some of the party faithful cold. "They all suck," wrote Erick Erickson on his Republican blog, RedState.<P>The party's chances could be boosted by the unexpected, such as a decision by Michael Bloomberg, the mayor of New York and wealthy businessman, to run as an independent, taking votes mainly from the Democrats.<P>And despite the war, the country remains evenly divided between Republicans and Democrats. Pollsters and strategists expect the 2008 elections to be as close as the last three, and the Republicans have the ability to bounce back.<P>"In the last few elections, in the electoral vote column, they have almost been dead even," said Rhodes Cook, who runs a respected political newsletter in Washington. "Barring something unusual we will probably have another close election in 2008. So neither party is really starting in a bad position."<P>Even so, there are early signs of vulnerability in the Republican field. Mr McCain, though the long-time frontrunner, is not perceived to have generated much enthusiasm among the party's rank and file. In recent polls, he has been losing ground to Mr Giuliani and is in danger of being eclipsed.<P>"It's hard to say whether it's the Iraq debate or other issues but McCain hasn't been helping himself lately. Right now at least there does seem to be a sense that people are looking for faces other than McCain's," said Carroll Doherty of the independent Pew Research Centre for the People and the Press.<P>But the Pew's own polls suggest that Mr McCain's forceful advocacy of a troops increase is not an issue for Republicans. Mr Doherty said: "Among the Republicans there has been no slippage at all in support of the war over the last year, and even over the last six months. They still see the possibility of a successful outcome. They still want to keep the troops there."<P>However, that hawkish stand could hurt Mr McCain in the general election.<P>Mr McCain's two main opponents have weaknesses too, said Thomas Mann, an election specialist at the Brookings Institution. "Giuliani seems timed to self-destruct, given the mismatch between his views and a segment of the Republican party," he said. As for Mr Romney, "he has own burden to bear, his ideological movement since first running for office in Massachusetts and the Mormon issue".<P>Republican primary voters - of whom one-third are socially conservative -could be forced to choose between their anti-abortion, anti-gay principles and a candidate who has the best shot at the White House.<P>"It is almost a question of how badly the Republicans want to win," said Stephen Hess, who served in three Republican administrations and is now a professor at George Washington University. "Will they hold their nose and choose someone to lead the party because that is their best chance to return to the White House?"<P><b>The candidates</b><P>There are three Republicans in the top tier of candidates:<P><b>John McCain</b>, the Vietnam veteran and Arizona senator, is the strongest advocate of Mr Bush's troop increase in Iraq. At 72, he would be the oldest president in US history at the time of first taking office.<P><b>Rudy Giuliani</b>, who as New York mayor became a national figure after 9/11, will have to work hard to convince socially conservative Republicans to look past his liberal views on abortion and gay rights.<P><b>Mitt Romney</b>, the former governor of Massachusetts, also labours under the liberal tag, as well as having to ovecome suspicions from the Christian right about his Mormon faith.<P>Among others running are:<P><b>Sam Brownback</b>, senator from Kansas, a standard-bearer of conservative Republicans in the campaign against gay marriage and abortion rights.<P><b>Mike Huckabee</b>, a bass-playing southern Baptist preacher, former governor of Arkansas, and recovering fast-food addict who lost 50kg (8st) in weight.<P><b>Duncan Hunter</b>, California congressman and hawkish former chairman of the house armed services committee.<P><b>Tom Tancredo</b>, Colorado congressman since 1999, and a hardliner on immigration issues.
