        <p>
  A British government-funded report says the route of Israel's separation 
  barrier is trapping 250,000 Palestinians in enclaves designed to protect 
  Jewish settlers in the occupied territory.
</p>


        
          
          
            <p>
  It says that creation of the enclaves cutting Palestinian communities off 
  from the rest of the West Bank "almost totally ignores the daily needs 
  of the Palestinian population" and is "focused almost exclusively 
  on the desire to maintain the fabric of life of Israeli settlers".
</p>
<p>
  The critical report &shy; which says the existence of some Palestinian 
  communities is threatened by the barrier &shy; was produced by the Israeli 
  planning and rights organisation Bimkom. The research was jointly funded by 
  the New Israel Fund and the British Embassy in Tel Aviv.

</p>
<p>
  It says the barrier is cutting employment for Palestinians and isolating 
  farmers from markets, causing "particularly serious damage" to 
  residents' health-care needs and undermining social and family life.
</p>
<p>
  The report focuses on two categories of cut-off communities in the West 
  Bank. The first are "seam enclaves" between the barrier, broadly 
  to the east, and the 1967 Green Line, to the west. It comprises around 8,000 
  residents whose movements into the rest of the West Bank, where 2.5 million 
  Palestinians live, are heavily restricted by checkpoints. Pointing out that 
  residents in such enclaves require a military permit, the report says "
  Palestinians whose families have lived there for centuries must now acquire 
  permits, without which their mere presence in their villages constitutes an 
  offence."
</p>
<p>
  The second &shy; and larger &shy; category are "internal enclaves"
 which are bound in, sometimes virtually encircled, by the barrier and roads 
  forbidden to Palestinians to protect "fingers" of occupied 
  territory inhabited by Jewish settlers and to ensure the settlers' access to 
  Israel proper. 

</p>
<p>
  The report cites the example of the Bir Nabala enclave in which residents of 
  five villages traditionally linked to Jerusalemwill have only two ways out, 
  through tunnels, to Ramallah or the area of the West Bank village of Biddu. 
</p>
<p>
  The report also says, despite a series of Supreme Court decisions in favour 
  of rerouting the barrier, "there has been no meaningful change in the 
  system of considerations guiding the planners".
</p>
<p>
  Mark Regev, the Israeli Foreign ministry spokesman said the barrier had had 
  a major effect in reducing suicide bombings and added: "For 
  Palestinians there is an issue of quality of life; but for Israelis it is 
  one of life or death."
</p>
<p>
  Israel's Defence Minister, Amir Peretz, has spelled out a three-stage Middle 
  East peace initiative tied to a timetable, saying that "a new plan"
   was needed to replace Prime Minister Ehud Olmert's unilateral proposals 
  scuppered by the Lebanon war. He envisaged the process leading to 18 months 
  of "final status" talks on a permanent settlement.
