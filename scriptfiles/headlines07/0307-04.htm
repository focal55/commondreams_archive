<p>WASHINGTON - A majority of people from around the world hold 
predominantly negative views of Israel, Iran, and the United States, 
according to a survey of more than 28,000 respondents in 27 countries.</p>

<p>The survey, which was sponsored by the BBC World Service and designed by 
Globescan and the Washington-based Program for International Policy 
Attitudes (PIPA), found that 56 percent and 54 percent of all respondents 
said they had mainly negative views of Israel and Iran, respectively.</p>

        <!--/endimage/--> Fifty-one percent and 48 percent said the same about the United States and 
North Korea, respectively.</p>

<p>At the other end of the spectrum, 54 percent said they felt "mainly 
positive" about both Canada and Japan, while the European Union and 
France, with a 53 percent and 50 percent "positive" rating, were the next 
highest among the 12 countries rated in the survey.</p>

<p>"It appears that people around the world tend to look negatively on 
countries whose profile is marked by the use or pursuit of military 
power," said PIPA director Steven Kull.</p>

<p>"This includes Israel and the U.S., who have recently used military force, 
and North Korea and Iran, who are perceived as trying to develop nuclear 
weapons," he said, adding, "Countries that relate to the world primarily 
through soft power, like Japan, France, and the EU in general, tend to be 
viewed more positively."</p>

<p>Respondents in the multi-nation survey, some findings of which have been 
previously released, included randomly selected samples of between 800 and 
1200 people in the three nations of North America -- the U.S., Canada, and 
Mexico; three South American countries -- Chile, Argentina, and Brazil; 
six Asian countries -- India, the Philippines, South Korea, Australia, 
Indonesia, and China; and two African countries -- Nigeria and Kenya.</p>

<p>Nine European countries -- Russia, Italy, Britain, France, Portugal, 
Greece, Germany, Poland and Hungary -- and four predominantly Muslim 
countries -- the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Lebanon, Egypt, and Turkey --  
were also included.
</p>

<p>Each respondent was asked to assess whether the influence of the 12 
subject countries, which also included Britain, China, India, Russia, and 
Venezuela, was either "mainly positive" or "mainly negative." An average 
of about one out of four respondents declined to express an opinion one 
way or another.</p>

<p>Israel, according to the survey, stood out as having not only the largest 
number of respondents express a negative opinion about it, but also 
majorities in the greatest number of countries -- 23 out of 27. Iran was 
regarded unfavorably in 21 countries, and the U.S. and North Korea in 20 out of 
the 27.</p>

<p>Israel, whose war with Hezbollah last summer in Lebanon undoubtedly 
affected the results, was seen most negatively in the Arab world and 
Turkey (where only two percent of respondents gave it a "positive" rating) 
and in much of Europe. In Lebanon itself, 85 of respondents said they had 
a negative opinion of the Jewish State, followed by 78 percent in Egypt, 
and 76 percent in Turkey.</p>

<p>At the same time, 77 percent of German respondents expressed a negative 
opinion, as did around two-thirds of Greek, French and British and 
Australian respondents. In Latin American and Asia, Brazil (72 percent) 
and Indonesia (71 percent) were the most negative, respectively.</p>

<p>Nations that were most positive about Israel were Nigeria (45 percent 
positive), the U.S. (41 percent), and Kenya (38 percent).</p>

<p>For Iran, the strongest negative opinions were found in Europe, 
particularly in France (86 percent), Italy (84 percent), Germany (78 
percent), Portugal (77 percent), and Britain (76 percent). Three out of 
four Canadians and Australians also expressed mainly negative opinions 
about Iran, which Washington and other western powers have accused of 
pursuing nuclear weapons. In the U.S., 63 percent of respondents gave a 
negative assessment, a remarkably sharp drop from the 81 percent who 
expressed a negative opinion in a similar BBC poll take in late 2005.</p>

<p>In Lebanon, opinions on Iran were roughly evenly split, while positive 
views of the Islamic Republic were most prevalent in Egypt (51 percent 
positive, 18 percent negative) and Indonesia (50 percent positive, 31 
percent negative). In Latin America the greatest negativity was found in 
Brazil (69 percent); in Africa, Kenya (60 percent); and in East Asia, 
South Korea (69 percent).</p>

<p>On North Korea, opinions were most negative in Anglophone North America, 
Australia, and South Korea. Nearly nine out of ten Germans and Australians 
expressed negative views, nearly eight of 10 South Koreans expressed 
similar views, as did three out of four U.S., Canadian, and French 
respondents.</p>

<p>
Several countries, however, leaned slightly positively toward Pyongyang, 
including Lebanon (38 percent positive, 27 percent negative); Turkey (31 
percent positive, 22 percent negative); Nigeria (42 percent positive, 28 
percent negative); Indonesia (40 percent positive, 37 percent negative); 
and India (26 percent positive, 18 percent negative).</p>

<p>Among the more positively-viewed countries, Japan was seen most favorably 
by Indonesians (84 percent), Kenyans and Canadians (74 percent), and 
Filipinos (70 percent), despite Tokyo's occupation of the archipelago 
during World War II. Less surprisingly, the most negative views were found 
in South Korea (58 percent negative) and China (63 percent), both of which 
have long demanded apologies by Tokyo for abuses committed by its 
occupation forces.</p>

<p>The EU was viewed positively in 24 out of 27 nations in the survey and 
given particularly high ratings in EU member-countries themselves, and by 
Canada, Chile, and South Korea. On the other hand, it was given slightly 
negative ratings by Turkey (30 percent positive, 32 percent negative), 
Egypt (10 percent positive, 33 percent negative), and Brazil (31 percent 
positive, 38 percent negative).</p>

<p>France was given ratings of 54 percent or greater in all European 
countries, with the exception of Poland (51 percent) and Hungary (40 
percent); the two African nations, Lebanon and Canada. In Asia, favourable 
views were most prevalent in China (62 percent) and South Korea (55 
percent).</p>

<p>The most negative views toward France, whose outspoken opposition to the 
U.S. war in Iraq has won it wide notice, were found in Turkey (69 percent 
negative, nine percent positive), and the U.S. (41 percent negative, 38 
percent positive). The latter finding actually marked an improvement over 
the previous year two years. In 2004, 52 percent of U.S. respondents said 
they had mainly negative views of Paris.</p>

<p>On China, the most negative views were found in Europe and the U.S, while 
the most positive opinions were found in Africa, the Arab world, 
Indonesia, the Philippines, and Chile. An average of 42 percent of all 
respondents (except those in China itself) said they had a positive view 
of Beijing; 32 percent said their view was mainly negative.</p>
