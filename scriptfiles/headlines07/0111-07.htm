<p>Allies of President George W. Bush rallied to his new strategy for Iraq but Britain still plans to reduce its troop presence and widespread doubts remain about Iraq's future.</p>

Britain, Australia and Japan -- which supported the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003 -- backed the new Bush plan which involves sending more than 21,000 extra US troops in a bid to quell the insurgent-fuelled strife in Iraq.</p>
<p>But none offered new military help, while China and Germany, leading opponents of the invasion, expressed doubts that the new measures would stabilize Iraq.</p>

<p>Britain, the main US ally in Iraq and second largest troop contributor, said the US decision to send more troops and other measures showed the US determination to defuse the conflict.</p>
<p>"We hope that this joint effort to resolve this very difficult security situation will indeed succeed," British Foreign Secretary Margaret Beckett said in London.</p>
<p>But she added that Britain had no intention of increasing its troop presence in Iraq, which is scheduled to be cut this year.</p>
<p>"We're not in the same position" in Shiite Muslim southern Iraq as the United States in the rest of the country, said Beckett.</p>
<p>US troops have faced the more serious violence as they confront a Sunni Muslim insurgency backed at times by foreign Islamist fighters and also spiraling Shiite-Sunni violence.</p>
<p>The British government hopes to withdraw many of its 7,200 troops deployed around the southern city of Basra by the end of this year.</p>
<p>Beckett declined to be drawn on a report in The Daily Telegraph which said Britain will pull out around 2,700 troops before June. "It does depend on how things go in Basra," Beckett said.</p>
<p>Australia's Prime Minister John Howard also supported Bush, whose measures were announced in a speech to the nation late Wednesday.</p>
<p>"It was a very clear, calm and, above all, a realistic speech, but he didn't underestimate the challenge, he admitted some mistakes have been made and made it very clear what is at stake," he added.</p>

<p>"An American or Western defeat in Iraq would give an unbelievable boost to terrorism."</p>
<p>Howard also said Australia would not increase its current 1,400 troop strength in Iraq.</p>
<p>Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who is on a visit to Europe, pledged in a telephone conversation with Bush that his country would continue to provide reconstruction aid to Iraq, the Japanese embassy in Berlin said.</p>
<p>Japan sent troops to Iraq in its first foreign deployment to a country in conflict since World War II. That mission ended in July, although Tokyo still lends air support.</p>
<p>"The Japanese government praises this announcement as additional efforts by the US government to stabilize Iraq," Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Aso said in Tokyo.</p>
<p>China, which opposed the invasion, reacted to Bush's speech by saying peace and stability could only be secured in Iraq through democracy and national reconciliation.</p>
<p>"The peace and stability of Iraq... depends on the Iraqi people governing Iraq and national reconciliation," foreign ministry spokesman Liu Jianchao told reporters.</p>
<p>"The democratic, peaceful, and economic development of Iraq is the final way out."</p>
<p>In Germany, Karsten Voigt, the government's coordinator for relations with the United States, also expressed doubts over the new measures.</p>

<p>"There is a certain scepticism in the United States and we naturally share that here in Germany," Voigt told Suedwestrundfunk radio.</p>
<p>"The US president has often proved in the past to be too optimistic."</p>
<p>"But of course we and other countries which did not take part in the war hope the president is successful."</p>
<p>Voigt offered to use Germany's access to Syria and Iran to persuade them to participate in diplomatic efforts on Iraq.</p>
<p>Arab governments gave no immediate reaction. But Arab media gave negative comments.</p>
<p>The independent Jordanian newspaper, Al-Ghad, said in a commentary: "The new strategy will be concerned with protecting America, not with protecting Iraq. This is a new mistake that the American administration will add to its record in the region."</p>
<p>The newspaper predicted that "as a result of this (plan) hatred towards America will increase in the Arab world."</p>
