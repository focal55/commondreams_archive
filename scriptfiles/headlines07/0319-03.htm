Calling for an immediate end to the American presence in Iraq, about 3,000 
boisterous protesters marched from the Embarcadero through downtown San 
Francisco to Civic Center on Sunday afternoon.

What the march may have lacked in numbers, it made up for in intensity. 
<P>"Don't let Bush and Cheney break your spirit,'' the Rev. Amos Brown, 
leader of the local chapter of the NAACP and a former San Francisco supervisor, 
told the crowd at Civic Center Plaza.  
<P>Keith Goodman of Berkeley, who pushed his 4-year-old daughter in a 
stroller the length of the march, warned that the full story of Iraq is not 
being told. 
<P>"No one seems to be talking about the Iraqis who are dying," he said. 
"Imagine if we shut down the electricity and closed all the hospitals in this 
country, what would the death toll be here?'' 
<P>Timed to mark today's fourth anniversary of the U.S. invasion, the march 
began shortly before 1 p.m. at Justin Herman Plaza near the Embarcadero and 
proceeded up Market Street. By 3:30 p.m., the speeches were done and the 
banners furled, and the crowd had begun to melt away. 
<P>Protesters also hit the streets Sunday in communities around the nation, 
including major cities like New York and Portland, Ore., and smaller towns like 
Boise, Idaho, and Bangor, Maine. 
<P>Among the San Francisco demonstrators were former members of the military  
who had served in Iraq. 
<P>"I felt comfortable with the idea of protecting America based on the 
assumption that Saddam (Hussein) had weapons of mass destruction,'' said 
24-year-old Sean O'Neill of Fremont, a former Marine sergeant who served two 
tours in Iraq. "I started having real problems with the war when those 
assumptions proved false.'' 
<P>There's growing discontent in the military over the war in Iraq, O'Neill 
said, even among soldiers who went to the Middle East for idealistic reasons. 
<P>"Things change for them when they get over, when they see the way things 
are going on the ground,'' O'Neill said. 
<P>Also participating in the March were members of Code Pink, a group that on 
March 11 began a round-the-clock vigil outside House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's 
Pacific Heights home. The group set up "Camp Pelosi" on the steps of her 
Broadway Street home and plans to stay until Congress votes on the supplemental 
appropriation bill for the war later this week. 
<P>"We're not against Nancy Pelosi. We're not protesting Nancy Pelosi. We 
want her to provide strong leadership to end the war now,'' said Cynthia 
Papermaster, a San Francisco resident and member of Code Pink. "We want her to 
cut funding and end the war now, not a year from now." 
<P>Pelosi has said she is sympathetic to their cause. 
<P>Doubt about the conduct of the war, which fueled November's Democratic 
takeover of Congress, continues to grow. A CNN poll of 1,027 adults released 
Sunday showed that only 35 percent of Americans are confident about the war in 
Iraq, down from 83 percent when the war began. Thirty percent of those surveyed 
were proud of the war, down from 65 percent in 2003.  
<P>Sunday's San Francisco march was in keeping with the city's reputation. 
The air reeked of burning white sage and patchouli and, occasionally, 
marijuana. Two men in tight shorts and arm ruffles danced on stilts, 
accompanied by musicians playing accordions, clarinets, bongos and finger 
cymbals. At Civic Center, booths hawked literature, T-shirts and bumper 
stickers promoting the virtues of movements and philosophies that would be 
considered irregular or even scandalous in more conservative quarters. 

<P>While Iraq was the day's main focus, the marchers had plenty of other 
concerns. More than a half-dozen speakers fired up the protesters before the 
march, calling on the United States to abandon its military bases throughout 
the world, most especially in Iraq, Afghanistan and the Philippines. 
<P>People carried signs saying "Impeach," "No Blood for Oil" and even "Obama 
'08.'' 
<P>About 30 American Indians at the head of the march called for an end to 
more than 500 years of "illegal occupation'' of North America by people of 
European descent. 
<P>"Native Americans are leading this protest because we've always been 
marginalized in this country,'' said Morning Star Gali of California's Pit 
River tribe. "In the last couple of years, we've been speaking out more and 
more against the occupation in Iraq.'' 
<P>San Francisco police no longer estimate crowd sizes, although department 
spokesman Sgt. Neville Gittens said protest organizers told police to expect 
3,000 to 5,000 marchers. The Chronicle's estimate of 3,000 is based on a count 
of the crowd as it moved off Market Street onto McAllister Street. A speaker 
praised the crowd at Civic Center for its size, telling the crowd it was 
3,000-strong.  
<P>There were no reported problems with the march, Gittens said. 
<P>The protest didn't attract anywhere near the crowds that showed up for 
similar events in 2002 and 2003 that blocked access to much of downtown San 
Francisco. 
<P>"There are demonstrations all over the Bay Area today," said Berkeley 
resident Bill Booth, 82. "That may have diluted the turnout in San Francisco a 
little."
