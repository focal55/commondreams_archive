<p>Less than a month before his court-martial begins, Army 1st Lt. Ehren Watada turned to the public Friday, urging it  to get involved in the discussion about the Iraq war.</p>
<p>Seven months ago, Watada made headlines when he refused to deploy to Iraq with a Fort Lewis-based Stryker Brigade, saying the war was illegal. His decision drew the attention of the anti-war movement, and eventually charges for conduct unbecoming an officer and missing a troop movement.</p>
<p>On Friday, Watada continued to talk, wondering about the lack of public outrage over the nearly four-year-old war.</p>
<p>"Could it be that ... many people don't care about the illegality of this war?" Watada asked students and others who packed a hall at Seattle Central Community College. "It is my belief that the American people have relinquished their responsibility."</p>
<p>He also blamed elected officials.  </p>
<p>Watada, 28, said initial reasons offered to justify the Iraq war -- the presence of weapons of mass destruction and Iraq's purported ties to terrorists -- turned out to be unsubstantiated.</p>
<p>"We have all been deceived," Watada told the audience. The "American people have the power to end this war."</p>

<p>Officials at Fort Lewis were unavailable for comment Friday.</p>
<p>Watada compared the Iraqi engagement to the Vietnam War. "The arguments used against me are the same ones they used 30 years ago," Watada said. "Vietnam is now Iraq."</p>
<p>Watada's public stance and looming trial have spurred Seattle-area students and others to rally outside Fort Lewis and call for student walkouts Feb. 5, the day his court-martial is scheduled to begin. </p>
<p>Even though the Democratically controlled Congress is questioning the war and President Bush's plan to deploy more troops, Watada doesn't expect the shift to play a role in his case. Watada could face up to six years in prison if found guilty of one count of missing a troop movement and four counts of disobeying an order. </p>
<p>"No, I don't think it will have any bearing on my case," Watada said. "Knowing you will probably lose is no excuse not to take a course of action."</p>
