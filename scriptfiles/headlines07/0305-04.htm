<p>They came with dreams of working on a movie set, or at the very least of earning some respectable cash as a walk-on extra, encouraged by a mysterious advertisement printed recently in a Berlin tabloid.</p>

But the reality was different for dozens of Arab-speaking applicants at a supposed casting session, only to be told they were wanted to play Iraqis and Afghans in a US wargame planned for later this month.</p>
<p>For between &pound;61 and &pound;88 a day, 600 German-based Arab speakers are being offered work with the US military, pretending to be mayors, shopkeepers, terrorists or even brothel owners. The Americans call them COBs or Civilians on the Battlefield. The idea is to set them in a landscape simulating Afghanistan or Iraq, in Bavaria.</p>
<p>At a recent recruitment session in Berlin run by the casting agency b.o.r.k. Dienstleistungen, many turned back at the door when asked: "Do you have anything against working for Americans?" Der Spiegel magazine said only four out of dozens decided to stay after hearing what the job entailed. One Moroccan man refused to take part, saying: "I will not help the Americans hurt my brothers."</p>
<p>The US military admits recruiting was a challenge, but says it is confident it will get the numbers needed to enact the war game. The three-week role-play is to take place from March 20 on a 65 square mile site dotted with villages in Hohenfels, to school soldiers in how to mix with Arabs or Afghans and "tune in" to their culture. Shut off from the world the "extras" are being asked to stay on set, and in character, 24 hours a day, monitored by CCTV cameras and sensors.</p>
<p>"We're looking for more realism," said Reggie Bourgeois, executive officer of the US Army's Joint Multinational Readiness Center (JMRC) in Bavaria. "The more actual culture we can inject into the exercise the better it is for our soldiers."</p>
<p>"After all, we're in the business of dealing with the culture."</p>
<p>The main objective is to "fail to understand" the US soldiers, to goad the troops into thinking for themselves. "It's easier to fight, it's harder to restrain," Mr Bourgeois said. "We try to teach them their weapon system should be the last resort, and to keep them from doing down-range dumb things."</p>
<p>Major Eric Bloom of JMRC said the US military "owed it" to the countries where they sent troops to learn as much as possible about the cultural differences.</p>
<p>"One example is the greeting," he said. "It might be normal there to physically touch, hug, or a cheek to cheek kind of a deal, while we're used to our own space, and we have to learn to become comfortable with such differences."
