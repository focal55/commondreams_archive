<p>In his nationwide address last night, U.S. President George W. Bush told Americans that expanding his troop presence in Iraq by more than 21,000 was a &quot;struggle that will determine the direction of the global war on terror – and our safety here at home.&quot;</p>
<p>And, he said, once security is under control in Iraq's most violent areas, increased reconstruction programs can be put in place to help restore the confidence of Iraqis who have seen little progress since the American-led invasion. </p>
<p>But those who monitor the ongoing violence in Iraq say the civilians who are dying in unprecedented numbers in the traumatized country will receive little or no benefit from the troop-boosting exercise – it may even increase their suffering.</p>
<p>Allan Rock, former Canadian ambassador to the United Nations, said, &quot;civilians are being treated as though they are entirely expendable in Bush's war, and by the warring factions bent on destroying each other. It is civilians that pay the ultimate price for this failed war.&quot;</p>
<p>Bush said the American troops would be working alongside Iraqi forces, and would have a &quot;green light&quot; to enter otherwise dangerous neighbourhoods.</p>
<p>But John Sloboda, a founder of the Iraq Body Count Project, says: &quot;We have to presume that the extra troops will engage in activities that soldiers do – namely, killing people.</p>
<p>&quot;Their targets will be insurgents. And in Baghdad, insurgents are deeply embedded in populated areas.</p>
<p>&quot;For every insurgent you kill, using such highly lethal weaponry, you will probably kill two to three civilians and injure others. This is not a strategy that will stop violence,&quot; said Sloboda.</p>
<p>Tallying recorded deaths, the Iraq Body Count Project calculates that between 53,101 and 58,704 Iraqis were killed between the 2003 invasion and mid-December. (Project staff reject as &quot;extreme and improbable&quot; the 650,000-person toll in a study published last October in the respected British medical journal <em>The Lancet</em>.) </p>
<p>The Washington-based Brookings Institution says the daily average of inter-ethnic attacks in Iraq has risen from zero in November 2003 to 15 in November 2006. In the same period, the number of internally displaced people increased from 100,000 to 650,000, while insurgent numbers spiked from 5,000 to 25,000 and the strength of Shiite militias rose from 5,000 to 50,000.</p>
<p>The latest Pentagon quarterly report for November 2006, meanwhile, showed that &quot;the total number of attacks increased by 22 per cent,&quot; over a three-month period beginning in August 2006, while &quot;the overwhelming majority of casualties were suffered by Iraqis.&quot; During that period, 93 Iraqi civilians were killed or injured each day, the report said.</p>
<p>Critics say Bush's plan for increasing American troops will not end the bloodshed or put Iraq on the road to stability. About 132,000 U.S. troops are now serving in Iraq.</p>
<p>Rory Stewart, a former British diplomat who was deputy governor in two southern Iraqi provinces, called it &quot;a very grave mistake,&quot; adding &quot;before a policy-maker makes that kind of decision we need some indication of a positive development, something over the last four years which is improving, and which you would reasonably expect 20,000 troops to turn around.&quot;</p>
<p>With little or nothing improving in the infrastructure, security environment or economy, Stewart told the BBC, &quot;it would be better to acknowledge that what we can do we have done, and the time has come for us to leave.&quot;</p>
<p>Prime Minister Tony Blair announced yesterday that a British training and counter-insurgency operation to allow Iraqis to take over security in Basra could be completed in the next few weeks, although Shiite factions are still fighting for supremacy in the area. Britain has already handed over authority to Iraqis in two of four southern provinces.</p>
<p>But Mary Habeck, an associate professor at the Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, said increasing U.S. troops in Iraq would help to provide security if they were working to pacify the turbulent Anbar province, as Bush pledged.</p>
<p>Although American forces have battled insurgents there, she says, an accord signed by 25 local tribes and the Iraqi government could be the basis for peace.</p>
<p>&quot;The jihadist ethic that animates Al Qaeda and other groups has only marginal appeal in Al Anbar,&quot; says Habeck, author of <em>Knowing the Enemy: Jihadist Ideology and the War on Terror</em>. </p>
<p>And, she said, a job-creation program could turn the tide against the insurgency when command was turned over to Iraqi troops in the province: &quot;the insurgents can't any longer motivate people to train and carry out sophisticated attacks. Instead, they're paid salaries to lay IEDs (roadside bombs). To combat that you need a program that would pay them to work instead.&quot;</p>
