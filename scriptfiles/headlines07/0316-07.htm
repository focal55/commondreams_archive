<p>A strong link between droughts and 
violent civil conflicts in the developing world bodes ill for an 
increasingly thirsty world, say scientists, who warn that drought-related 
conflicts are expected to multiply with advancing climate change.
</p>

<p>"Severe, prolonged droughts are the strongest indicator of high-intensity 
conflicts," said Marc Levy of the Center for International Earth Science 
Information Network at Columbia University's Earth Institute in New York.</p>

<p>These are internal conflicts, not between countries, and involving more 
than 1,000 battle deaths, Levy said at a press briefing in Washington last 
week.</p>

<p>Such conflicts tend to occur about a year after a "severe deviation in 
rainfall patterns", he said.
</p>

<p>Levy and colleagues used decades of detailed precipitation records, 
geospatial conflict information and other data in a complex computer model 
that overlays all this onto a fine-scale map of the world.</p>

<p>"Major deviations from normal rainfall patterns were the strongest 
predictor of conflicts," he said. "I was surprised at how strong the 
correlation is."</p>

<p>Levy is careful to say that droughts don't directly cause conflicts but 
are more likely triggers in regions where there already tensions or 
low-level conflicts.</p>

<p>For example, in the recent civil conflict in Nepal, the parts of the 
country where most of the fighting occurred experienced low rainfall for 
several years and then a severe drought in the late 1990s.</p>

<p>Farmers may have simply given up hope of farming and joined the local 
rebellion as a way of sustaining themselves and their families, he 
hypothesised.</p>

<p>And rainfall appears to have a pacifying affect. The wet areas of Africa, 
for instance, have far fewer years of violent internal conflict than the 
dry regions, he said.</p>

<p>Areas with a high risk of conflict this year due to extremely dry 
conditions last year, according to his model, are Cote d'Ivoire, Sudan, 
Bangladesh, Haiti, and Nagaland and Manipur in India.</p>

<p>While the idea makes sense, "you can't predict how people will act", said 
Robert McLeman of the University of Ottawa, who studies the relationship 
between environmental extremes and human migration.</p>

<p>
"In Nigeria during periods of drought, the cattle herders and crop farmers 
usually work things out amongst themselves," McLeman told IPS.</p>

<p>Africans have been dealing with drought for thousands of years. Currently 
cities serve as an outlet so there is seasonal migration during the dry 
season. And more and more people are staying in cities where presumably 
they can meet their needs more easily than in the countryside, he said.</p>

<p>That said, McLeman noted that much of Afghanistan has experienced a long 
drought and farmers might consider joining up with the Taliban if there 
are no other choices for them.</p>

<p>Normal droughts can usually be accommodated, but significant and rapid 
environmental changes are more likely to lead to societal instability, 
forced migration and inter-group violence, says Nils Petter Gleditsch of 
the Centre for the Study of Civil War at the International Peace Research 
Institute in Oslo, Norway.</p>

<p>"Drought in Hungry is not the same as drought in Ethiopia" in terms of the 
state being able to buffer the impacts, Gleditsch added at the briefing.</p>

<p>While climate change will bring further environmental degradation --  
increased flooding and drought, higher temperatures -- the far-reaching 
social impacts have yet to be assessed, he said.</p>

<p>About 1.5 billion people are estimated to be suffering from severe water 
stress around the world, and that number is expected to increase with 
population growth and climate change.</p>

<p>"Climate change is likely to lead to a greater frequency of civil wars," 
Levy said.</p>

<p>Inequity is at the heart of most conflicts, said Satish Kumar, director of 
programmes at Schumacher College International Centre for Ecological 
Studies in Britain.
</p>

<p>"There is growing anger that the rich are the cause of global warming but 
it's the poor who will suffer the most," Kumar told IPS. "I've heard 
people make this connection in regard to the unprecedented droughts in 
parts of India."</p>

<p>The lifestyle of the average North American produces 12 times the amount 
of greenhouse gases compared to that of people in poor countries, 
according the U.N. statistics.</p>

<p>And there are also very rich people with similar 
high-greenhouse-gas-emission lifestyles in poor countries, Kumar points 
out.</p>

<p>Increased conflict, violence and social unrest is inevitable as global 
warming makes life even more difficult for many of the world's poor and 
they become aware that the rich of the world are responsible, Kumar added.</p>

<p>Only urgent action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to address 
economic and social inequities can stave off the worst.</p>

<p>And he warns against neo-liberal solutions: "Capitalism is shrewd enough 
to use shortages of resources like water to make even more money for the 
rich."</p>

<p>Researchers and activists around the planet will highlight other impacts 
of water scarcity on development and politics next week on "World Water 
Day", celebrated every Mar. 22.</p>
