"That a
person like (Bush), with the persecution of our migrant brothers in the
United States, with the wars he has provoked, is going to walk in our
sacred lands, is an offense for the Mayan people and their culture,"
Juan Tiney, the director of a Mayan nongovernmental organization with
close ties to Mayan religious and political leaders, said Thursday.</p>

<p>Bush's
seven-day tour of Latin America includes a stopover beginning late
Sunday in Guatemala. On Monday morning he is scheduled to visit the
archaeological site Iximche on the high western plateau in a region of
the Central American country populated mostly by Mayans.</p>

<p>Tiney
said the "spirit guides of the Mayan community" decided it would be
necessary to cleanse the sacred site of "bad spirits" after Bush's
visit so that their ancestors could rest in peace. He also said the
rites - which entail chanting and burning incense, herbs and candles _
would prepare the site for the third summit of Latin American Indians
March 26-30.</p>

<p>Bush's trip has already has sparked protests elsewhere in Latin America, including protests and clashes with police in Brazil

hours before his arrival. In Bogota, Colombia, which Bush will visit on
Sunday, 200 masked students battled 300 riot police with rocks and
small homemade explosives.</p>

<p>The tour is aimed at challenging a
widespread perception that the United States has neglected the region
and at combatting the rising influence of Venezuelan leftist President
Hugo Chavez, who has called Bush "history's greatest killer" and "the
devil."</p>

<p>Iximche, 30 miles west of the capital of Guatemala City,
was founded as the capital of the Kaqchiqueles kingdom before the
Spanish conquest in 1524.</p>
