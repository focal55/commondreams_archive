            <p>
  The findings highlight the glaring imbalance between the rich countries that 
  produce most of the pollution and the poor countries that suffer the 
  consequences in the forms of drought, floods, starvation and disease.
</p>
<p>
  The World Development Movement (WDM), a poverty campaign group, has drawn up 
  a "climate calendar" showing the dates when the UK will have 
  emitted as much CO2 gas as other countries will in a year.

</p>
<p>
  Unsurprisingly, the poorest counties such as Chad, Afghanistan and the 
  Democratic Republic of Congo produce virtually no carbon emissions. Even 
  populous countries such as India will be overtaken in its emissions by the 
  UK in a month's time. In fact, 164 countries in the world have a smaller 
  carbon footprint than the UK, while just 20, mainly including the major oil 
  producers as well as the US, have a larger one.
</p>
<p>
  By the end of tomorrow the average Briton will have produced 0.26 tonnes of 
  CO2 emissions.
</p>
<p>
  "The poorest countries in the world, with 738 million people, make no 
  contribution to climate change, but it is those same people who face the 
  worst consequences," Benedict Southworth, WDM's director, said. "
  One hundred and sixty thousand people are already dying every year due to 
  climate change- related diseases and billions will face drought, floods, 
  starvation and disease."
</p>
<p>
  WDM has calculated the figures by taking the annual CO2 emission for each 
  country, dividing by the number of people and then working out a daily 
  contribution.
</p>

<p>
  Thus while an Afghan on average will produce an annual equivalent of 0.02 
  tonnes of CO2, a Briton will produce 9.62 tonnes and the most prolific 
  polluter - someone from the United Arab Emirates - will emit about 56 tonnes.
</p>
<p>
  WDM acknowledged that its figures were based on averages that masked 
  differences between life in rural and urban areas, but said that the figures 
  still exposed the "injustice" of global warming.
</p>
<p>
  "It is the richest people in the world who have produced and who are 
  still producing most of the greenhouse gases causing climate change," 
  Mr Southworth said.
</p>
<p>
  The report said 7,800 Kenyans, Tanzanians and Rwandans died every year from 
  diseases that were related to climate change. It warned that a 2C rise in 
  temperature could lead to as many as 60 million more people being exposed to 
  malaria in Africa.
</p>
<p>

  The potential for massive ecological and human suffering as a result of 
  climate change was a key finding in the report by Sir Nicholas Stern, 
  although it was overshadowed by the political debate over the need for 
  higher taxes or the imposition of rationing.
</p>
<p>
  The Stern report found that many "vulnerable" regions embracing 
  millions of people in sub-Saharan Africa were at risk from harvest failures, 
  droughts and malaria.
</p>
<p>
  It warned that these phenomena would affect the poorest people most of all 
  and fuel conflicts and raise the number of child deaths as populations moved 
  to avoid the worst-hit areas.
</p>
<p>
  WDM said that although the Government had used the Stern report to show 
  Britain's commitment to fighting climate change, emissions had risen 5 per 
  cent under Labour.
</p>
<p>
  It called on the Government to include legally binding annual targets to cut 
  emissions in its Climate Change Bill.

  <b>Carbon comparison </b>
</p>
<p>
  The average British citizen produces 26kg of CO2 in a day. This breaks down 
  as follows: 
</p>
<p>
  * 7.4 electricity <br>* 1.6 fuel production <br>* 3.8 manufacturing and 
  construction <br>* 7.4 transport, of which: (5.2 road transport, 1.7 air 
  travel, 0.1 railways and 0.4 shipping)<br>* 1.0 office buildings <br>* 3.8 
  residential heating <br>* 1.0 Other industrial processes, agriculture, 
  military travel, other

</p>
<p>
  The average Kenyan citizen produces 0.7kg of CO2 in a day. This breaks down 
  as follows: 
</p>
<p>
  * 0.08 electricity <br>* 0.08 fuel production <br>* 0.16 manufacturing and 
  construction <br>* 0.31 transport <br>* 0.07 other
