<p>LONDON  - Iraqis are increasingly pessimistic about the future, four years after ouster of Saddam Hussein -- and fewer than one in five have faith in the US-led coalition, a poll showed Monday.</p>

The survey, contrasting with a survey two years ago, indicated that barely a quarter -- 26 percent -- feel safe in their own neighbourhoods as the anniversary of the US-led invasion is marked this week.</p>
<p>Only 18 percent of those polled have confidence in the United States and the US-led coalition troops, while some 78 percent opposed the presence of coalition forces and 69 percent said it worsened the security situation.</p>
<p>Faith in the new Iraqi government was a little better, although hardly overwhelming: 53 percent were dissatisfied with the performance of the Iraqi government.</p>
<p>But some 63 percent said foreign troops should only leave after security improved and the capacity of Iraq's institutions was strengthened, according to the poll commissioned by the BBC, ABC News, ARD German TV and USA Today.</p>
<p>A survey conducted for the BBC in November 2005 painted a much brighter picture, with 71 percent saying things were good in the lives, 64 percent saying their lives would be better in 12 months, and 69 percent saying the situation in the country would be improved in a year.</p>
<p>Britain's ambassador to Baghdad, Dominic Asquith, told BBC radio that different polls were prone to show different views of experiences of life in Iraq.</p>
<p>&quot;These are snapshots and snapshots can always give a rather different view of the picture,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;What we're seeing in the most recent poll you've produced is the effect of the sectarian violence that broke out after the Samarra attack,&quot; he added, referring to the bombing of a Shiite shrine which triggered a sectarian war between Sunnis and Shiites in February 2006.</p>
<p>According to the latest survey, 39 percent of Iraqis questioned think things are going well in their lives, while 35 percent think their lives will improve over the next year. Just 40 percent believe the general situation will improve.</p>       
<p>Some 86 percent of those questioned expressed concern about someone in their household being a victim of violence.</p>
<p>The poll found that basic necessities were lacking in Iraq, with 88 percent of respondents saying the availability of electricity was either &quot;quite bad&quot; or &quot;very bad&quot;.</p>
<p>About 69 percent gave similar responses for the availability of clean water, and 88 percent for the availability of driving or cooking fuel.</p>
<p>There was some solace for supporters of the foreign presence in Iraq, however, as 56 percent did not believe that Iraq was in a state of civil war, while 58 percent were in favour of maintaining a unified Iraq.</p>
<p>Asquith also claimed that there were &quot;positive&quot; signs that the US security plan in Baghdad is beginning to have a positive effect.   </p>
<p>&quot;There are some people who left Baghdad out of fear who are coming back,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>"There is some degree of normality -- I'm not saying it is normality but there is some degree of normality -- coming back.
<p>"Shops are beginning to open, children are beginning to play on the streets."
<p>Pollsters D3 Systems questioned more than 2,000 people across all 18 Iraqi provinces between February 25 and March 5 for the survey.&nbsp;</p>
