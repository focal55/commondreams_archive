 <p> WASHINGTON  - Four years after the U.S.-led invasion, Iraqis 
have never been more pessimistic about their lives and antagonistic toward 
their purported liberators, according to a major new poll released Monday 
by BBC, ABC News, USA Today and the German ARD television network.</p>
The survey of some 2,200 people throughout the country found that security 
has become by far the most important issue for Iraqis in their personal 
lives, particularly compared to the results of similar surveys in 2004 and 
2005.
<br><br>
Nearly two out of three Iraqis said they were concerned "a great deal" 
that either they or someone living in their household might become a 
victim of violence in the country, and nearly half (47 percent) said had 
either a close personal friend of immediate family members living outside 
their household who had been physically harmed by the violence.
<br><br>
And 40 percent said they blamed most of the violence on U.S. or coalition 
forces (31 percent) or on U.S. President George W. Bush (nine percent). By 
contrast, 18 percent blamed al Qaeda or foreign jihadis; 19 percent on 
Sunni or Shia militias or sectarian conflicts; and seven percent on Iran.

<br><br>
And some 78 percent of respondents said they either "somewhat" (32 
percent) or "strongly" opposed the presence of U.S. and coalition forces 
in Iraq -- up from 65 percent in BBC poll taken in late 2005, and 51 
percent from one conducted in 2004.
<br><br>
In addition, nearly six in 10 respondents (59 percent) said they now 
believe the U.S. now "controls" events in Iraq, compared to just 24 
percent who took that position in 2005, during which two elections were 
carried out. By contrast, the percentage who said they believed the Iraqi 
government was in control has dropped from 44 percent two years ago to 34 
percent today.
<br><br>
The survey, which was carried out in face-to-face interviews Feb. 25 to 
Mar. 5, also found a dramatic rise in the percentage of respondents who 
said they considered attacks on coalition forces to be acceptable -- from 
just 17 percent in 2004 to 51 percent today.
<br><br>
That finding, however, was slightly less than the 60 percent who took that 
position in a poll released last September by the University of Maryland's 
Programme on International Policy Attitudes (PIPA).
<br><br>
By contrast, only 12 percent said attacks on Iraqi governments forces 
could be considered acceptable, while 88 percent disagreed.
<br><br>
As in the PIPA poll, the survey found major differences in view among 
Iraqis based on their sectarian or ethnic identities. Thus, the Kurds, who 
make up between 15 and 20 percent of the national population were the 
least pessimistic and anti-American among the groups.
<br><br>
By contrast, Sunni Arabs, who make up about 20 percent of the population, 
were the most pessimistic and anti-American. Shi'a respondents, who 
represent about 60 percent of the population fell in between the two.
<br><br>
"Iraqi views appear to be trending generally negatively," said Stephen 
Weber, who helped design last September's PIPA poll. "The differences 
between sectarian groups continue to be very sharp," he noted, pointing to 
respondents' answers to whether or not the U.S.-led coalition was wrong to 
invade Iraq in 2003.
<br><br>

While nearly four out of five Shia respondents said it was right, only two 
percent of Sunnis agreed, while 78 percent said it was "absolutely wrong."
<br><br>
The survey confirmed that the citizens of Baghdad and al Anbar province, 
the main targets of the Bush's administration's ongoing surge of some 
30,000 troops to join the 140,000 already deployed in Iraq, feel the least 
secure among all Iraqis, with around 80 percent of respondents from the 
capital and the central region, of which Anbar is a part described the 
security situation as either "quite" or "very bad". That was more than 
twice the percentage of the other major regions.
<br><br>
Senior U.S. civilian and military officials, including Bush himself, have 
claimed over the past two weeks that the "surge" has reduced violence in 
Baghdad, in particular, although they have also warned that that it will 
take at least six months more to assess its impact.
<br><br>
"The new strategy will need more time to take effect," Bush said Monday in 
an address marking the fourth anniversary of the invasion. "And there will 
be good days and there will be bad days ahead as the security plan 
unfolds," he added, appealing for the public and Congress here to be 
patient as Washington's latest counter-insurgency strategy.
<br><br>
Indeed, the latest survey was not completely negative with respect to U.S. 
efforts in Iraq, although 69 percent said they believed that the presence 
of U.S. forces in Iraq had made security "worse" and 82 percent said they 
either had "not very much" (30 percent) or "no confidence at all" (52) in 
U.S. and British occupation forces.
<br><br>
Despite those findings, only 35 percent said they wanted U.S. and 
coalition forces to "leave now" (up from 26 percent in 2005), while a 
plurality of 38 percent said they should "remain until security is 
restored", and 11 percent said they should "remain until Iraqi security 
forces can operate independently."
<br><br>
Bush could also draw solace from the 56 percent majority who said they 
believe that Iraq is not involved in a "civil war" at this time and a 
similar percentage who said they considered a "civil war" either 
"somewhat" (46 percent) or "very unlikely" (11 percent).
<br><br>
In addition, 47 percent of respondents -- the same as in 2005 -- said they 
still believe the U.S. invasion was positive on balance.
<br><br>
In addition, a plurality of 43 percent of Iraqis said they preferred a 
democratic government to either one led by a "strong leader (34 percent) 
or an "Islamic state" (22 percent).

<br><br>
Nonetheless, even that finding showed a marked decline in optimism from 
2005 when 57 percent of respondents opted for democracy. Fifty-three 
percent said they believed that Iraq will still be ruled by a democratic 
government in five years.
<br><br>
Aside from those findings, however, the overwhelming message of the survey 
appeared to be one of growing dissatisfaction and pessimism. Only 39 
percent of respondents -- compared to 71 percent in 2005 -- said things 
were going relatively well in their lives.
<br><br>
Fifty-eight percent said their lives were either about the same (22 
percent) or worse (36 percent) compared to the period immediately before 
the invasion, and two-thirds said things were going worse for the country 
as a whole (compared to 53 percent in 2005).
<br><br>
Forty percent of respondents said they thought the country would be better 
off one year from now, a precipitous drop from the 69 percent who felt 
that way in 2005.
<br><br>
The survey found overwhelming dissatisfaction with the provision of basic 
services. Seven in ten respondents rated the availability of medical care 
and clean water negatively; eight in ten respondents rated the employment 
situation and the supplies of fuel for cooking or driving negatively; and 
nine in ten described the supply of electricity as bad. Majorities also 
said they did not expect the situation in each category to improve over 
the next year.
