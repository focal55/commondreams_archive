<p>


Human rights groups urged speedy action on the bill sponsored by Senators Dianne Feinstein of California and Patrick Leahy  of Vermont.</p>
<p>

Dropped from aircraft or fired by artillery, cluster munitions open above ground and disperse dozens to hundreds of tiny bomblets over a wide area.</p>
<p>

Although designed to stop armored assaults, bomblets have fallen on civilian areas and littered fields long after the end of hostilities, most recently in Lebanon.</p>

<p>

The bill would restrict funding for the use, sale or transfer of cluster munitions unless their submunitions have a failure rate of less than one percent, or unless the president grants a waiver on national security grounds.</p>
<p>

It would also bar their use in or near civilian areas.</p>
<p>

Since 2005, the Defense Department has required that newly purchased submunitions have a failure rate of less than one percent.</p>
<p>

Human Rights Watch, however, estimates that only about 30,000 of the millions of cluster munitions currently in the US arsenal meet the bill's criteria.</p>
<p>

&quot;The US has a staggering number of submunitions in its arsenal -- perhaps one billion - that are highly unreliable and should never be used,&quot; said Steve Goose of the New York-based rights group.</p>
<p>

The United States used about 2 million submunitions in Iraq in 2003, some 248,000 in Afghanistan in 2001 and 2002, and another 295,000 on Kosovo in 1999, the group said.</p>
