<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p>Every single week, the American people spend $2 billion in Iraq &mdash; much of it for troops and materiel, but plenty of it for schools and hospitals and electricity for Iraqis. Their oil money hasn't paid for reconstruction. We have.</p><p>Nor has the White House hesitated to shove us off into a deep sea of red ink to continue funneling billions toward its Iraqi misadventure. What if, instead of putting this war on a credit card, we were paying for it with real money? We could lay off the National Park Service, perhaps, or close the FDA. We could make up the full cost of the war simply by wiping out Medicare for a year. But why take such measures when we can use Visa? Despite a national debt in the mega-trillions, Congress hasn't blocked a single bill appropriating money for this war.</p>



<p>Yet, several states are struggling to find the money to keep providing inexpensive health insurance for the children of working-class families &mdash; right here at home. Georgia, for example, will soon run out of money for PeachCare, which provides affordable health care for the children of families who earn too much money to be eligible for Medicaid, which takes care of the impoverished. A dozen other states are also expected to run out of money for similar programs this year.</p><p>Congress has been reluctant to provide additional funds to those states where the health insurance has proved more popular than expected or where, for other reasons, costs have risen quickly. Earlier this month, Georgia Gov. Sonny Perdue went to Washington to plead for bridge payments to cover PeachCare for the rest of this fiscal year. So far, nothing.</p><p>In an odd twist of timing, L. Paul Bremer, who used to head reconstruction efforts in Iraq, was in Washington just last week, testifying before a House committee. U.S. Rep. Henry Waxman (D-Calif.) was especially interested in $12 billion in cash &mdash; shrink-wrapped in huge stacks &mdash; that was flown to Iraq aboard cargo planes between May 2003 and June 2004. Government auditors have noted that few reasonable accounting rules were applied; the money was not monitored once it reached Iraq. Only this much is certain: None of those billions is now available to help American children get health care.</p><p>Last week, as a result of the funding crunch, Georgia officials said they will close PeachCare to new enrollees. So, if you just lost your job and your medical benefits, too bad. You can't get your children into PeachCare after March 11.</p><p>PeachCare grew out of an innovative initiative &mdash; known by its bureaucratic acronym, SCHIP (State Children's Health Insurance Program) &mdash; backed by President Bill Clinton and passed by Congress in 1997. The program, jointly funded by the states and the federal government, is credited with reducing the number of uninsured children by about one-third. The parents of many recipients are employees of retailers such as Wal-Mart, which is not known for lavishing generous benefits on employees.</p><p>In Georgia, families are eligible if they earn up to 235 percent of the poverty level, or $48,000 a year for a family of four. Parents pay monthly premiums ranging from $10 to $35 for one child to a maximum of $70 for two or more children.</p><p>The plan has been a boon for working families at a time when the economy is cleaving in two; highly educated workers in the information economy are doing quite well, while less educated workers are getting by on less and less. As factories shut down or move off-shore, the jobs that guarantee a decent wage with generous benefits are disappearing. You'd think Congress would rush to give those workers a hand up.</p><p>(For that matter, you'd think state legislators would give them a little more help, too. In Georgia, the governor is pressing for a tax break for affluent retirees. If he stopped giving tax breaks to the well-off, Perdue might have more left over for children who need health insurance.)</p><p>Instead, the politics of the past few years have fixed on fighting a misguided war and protecting the wealthy. There has been little left over for average folks. Already, the war in Iraq has cost us about $400 billion; with that, we could have paid for quality health insurance plans for every American without them and had plenty left over. Or, as London's Guardian newspaper has noted, we could have given each Iraqi &mdash; man, woman and child &mdash; nearly $15,000 each.</p><p>Either investment would have been more productive than the war.</p>
