<p>  OAKLAND  - The history of the modern U.S. 
conservative movement -- circa 1964 to the present -- is replete with its 
share of hucksters, snake oil salesman, rhetoricians, mudslingers, 
marketers and one-hit wonders. But it also has had more than its fair 
share of visionaries, opportunists (in the best sense of the word), 
motivated entrepreneurs, perhaps even revolutionaries.
Rod Martin, the founder and head of a new organisation called 
TheVanguard.org, linking Silicon Valley entrepreneurship with ideological 
zeal, appears to consider himself a conservative revolutionary for the 
twenty-first century.
<br><br>
To carry the "revolution forward" -- a slogan featured on the group's 
website -- Martin, a Silicon Valley-seasoned entrepreneur and political 
activist, has launched TheVanguard.org.
<br><br>
Most of the pieces for a rejuvenated conservative movement were already in 
place by 1994, including a highly-functional infrastructure of right-wing 
foundations, think tanks, advocacy organisations, media outlets --  
conservative talk radio and Christian television -- and an army of 
grassroots volunteers.
<br><br>

But a little over a decade later, youngish conservatives are again 
restless. Embittered by defeat at the hands of the Democratic Party in 
November, which they attribute to the Republican leadership "selling 
conservatives out", these new activists are calling for a new conservative 
movement.
<br><br>
In a relatively short time, Martin has made a name for himself as an 
up-and-coming organiser out to create just that.
<br><br>
At present, there are several noteworthy things about TheVanguard.org: the 
origin of its name; its stated goal to both emulate and take on 
MoveOn.org; its mix of Silicon Valley pedigree and fundraising sources 
with veteran movement conservatives; its weaving of so-called traditional 
religious principles with secular conservatism; and its hiring of 
dedicated slash-and-burn right-wing ideologues.
<br><br>
The term "vanguard" -- derived from the Middle English "vantgard" short 
for "avant garde" -- is defined in "The American Heritage Dictionary of 
the English Language" as "the foremost position in an army or fleet," 
"the... leading position in a trend or movement," and "those occupying 
such a position."
<br><br>
The term also has its roots firmly planted in Vladimir Ilyich Ulnayov 
(Lenin), the Russian revolutionary, who developed the idea of the Vanguard 
Party, and wrote about it in the 1902 pamphlet titled "What is to Be 
Done?" According to Wikipedia, "a vanguard party is a political party or 
grassroots organisation at the forefront of a mass action, movement, or 
revolution."
<br><br>
TheVanguard.org did not respond to an IPS request for an interview.
<br><br>
But in a recent interview with the conservative weekly Human Events, 
Martin paid tribute to, and took aim at, the highly successful liberal 
internet-based MoveOn,org.
<br><br>
"The left has been brilliant at leveraging technology," Martin said, "and 
so have we to a point: our bloggers and news sites are amazing, and the 
RNC's [Republican National Committee] get-out-the-vote software is 
unparalleled. But no one on our side has even begun to create anything 
like MoveOn. And after 2006, if we want to survive, much less build a 
long-term conservative majority, we better start, and fast."
<br><br>
In a letter to supporters posted at TheVanguard.org website, Martin 
pointed out that "the issue isn't just taking the fight to MoveOnà. [it] 
is also learning a lesson from MoveOn, by taking on -- and taking back --  
our own party first. MoveOn has done a great job of making the Democrat 
Party live up to the ideology of its membership. That may or may not be a 
good idea from an election point-of-view. But it's certainly been 
rewarding for the people who give their hearts and souls to electing 
Democrats year after year."

<br><br>
Martin, who has both entrepreneurial -- he worked for the Internet 
commerce site PayPal -- and movement experience -- he is a member of the 
Federalist Society and the secretive Council on National Policy among 
other far right groups -- has reeled in "a top-drawer cast, including 
Silicon Valley heavy-hitters like Eric Jackson (a former PayPal colleague 
of Martin's, where he was head of marketing) and Gil Amelio (former CEO of 
two Fortune 500 companies, including Apple Computer), among others," Human 
Events reported.
<br><br>
In addition, longtime movement conservatives such as Grover Norquist, 
founder and head of American for Tax Reform, Stephen Moore, founder of 
Club for Growth (and current Wall Street Journal editorial board member), 
"compassionate conservatism" guru Marvin Olasky, and Ronald Reagan 
Doctrine-architect Jack Wheeler are all members of Vanguard's board of 
advisors.
<br><br>
While Martin may be the force behind TheVangaurd.org, two recent hires 
could easily become the group's most controversial figures. In 
late-January, TheVanguard.org hired Jerome Corsi, co-author with John 
O'Neill of the 2004  book "Unfit for Command: Swift Boat Veterans Speak 
Out Against John Kerry," which seriously damaged the Kerry campaign that 
November, to become a senior political strategist.
<br><br>
The other new employee is Richard Poe, a longtime journalist and former 
employee of conservative provocateur/entrepreneur David Horowitz, who is 
the group's editorial and creative director. Poe recently co-authored, 
with Horowitz, "The Shadow Party: How George Soros, Hillary Clinton, and 
Sixties Radicals Seized Control of the Democratic Party," a book that 
accuses liberals of using deception, lies, and Soros' dough to take over 
the country.
<br><br>
Poe has also been a close observer of Hillary Clinton, having penned 
"Hillary's Secret War,"  which according to the author, describes "how 
Hillary Clinton and the left's 'shadow government' have laboured to put 
her and her far-left agenda in the White House by controlling the 
still-uncensored flow of real news to Americans -- via the Internet."
<br><br>
Frederick Clarkson, the author of "Eternal Hostility", a primer on the 
theocratic right in the United States, and a longtime observer of U.S. 
right-wing politics, told IPS that, "TheVanguard.org epitomises the 
tactics of the far right of the contemporary Republican Party."
<br><br>
"The recent additon of Jerome Corsi -- a leader of the 'swiftboat veterans 
for truth' which ran a vicious smear campaign against Sen. John Kerry when 
he ran for president, as the 'senior political strategist' is a fair 
indication of how it plans to use the powerful tool of the internet and 
the blogosphere."
<br><br>
"It is also startling to me that one of TheVanguard's advisers is Jack 
Wheeler, best known as an unofficial liaison to groups seeking to 
overthrow governments opposed by the Reagan White House, notably in 
Nicaragua, Mozambique, Afghanistan and Angola," Clarkson said. "It is 
strange that a prominent advocate of armed insurgencies is such a public 
advisor to a domestic political group."
<br><br>

These days, TheVanguard.org reports that its site traffic is rising and 
blog buzz is building. Whether this will "Forward the Revolution" as 
Martin intends, remains to be seen.
