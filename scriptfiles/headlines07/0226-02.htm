<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p> "An Inconvenient Truth," the 
big-screen adaptation of former U.S. Vice President Al Gore's 
slide-show lecture about the perils of global warming, won 
Academy Awards on Sunday for documentary feature and best song.</p>
<p> The award for best documentary went to director Davis 
Guggenheim and producers Lawrence Bender ("Pulp Fiction") and 
Laurie David, the environmentalist wife of "Seinfeld" 
co-creator Larry David.</p><p> But the film marked a personal triumph for Gore, the 2000 
Democratic presidential nominee who left politics after 
narrowly losing his White House bid to Republican George W. 
Bush and embarked on a new campaign calling attention to the 
threat of climate change.</p><p> "My fellow Americans, people all over the world, we need to 
solve the climate crisis," Gore said after taking the stage.</p><p> "It's not a political issue, it's a moral issue. We have 
everything we need to get started with the possible exception 
of the will to act. That's a renewable resource. Let's renew 
it."</p><p> Gore is the star and narrator of the documentary, which is 
widely credited with helping shift U.S. public opinion on the 
need for urgent action to curb man-made emissions of greenhouse 
gases linked to global warming.</p><p> Director Guggenheim handed Gore the Oscar and told the 
audience the movie was made "because we were moved to act by 
this man."

</p><p> GORE IN SPOTLIGHT</p><p> Rock star Melissa Etheridge won the Oscar for original song 
for the film's musical theme, "I Need to Wake Up," which she 
composed and performed for the movie. It marked the first song 
from a documentary to be nominated in that category since 
"More" from "Mondo Cane" in 1963.</p><p> "I have to thank Al Gore for inspiring us, inspiring me, 
showing that caring about the earth is not Democratic or 
Republican, it is not red or blue, we are all green," Etheridge 
said.</p><p> The Oscar win helps raise Gore's public profile as many of 
his fellow Democrats are beginning to jostle for their party's 
nomination for president next year, though the former vice 
president under Bill Clinton has repeatedly said he has no 
plans to run again in 2008.</p><p> The film has topped $45 million at the box office worldwide 
and sold 1 million DVDs. With $24 million in U.S. ticket sales 
alone, it ranks as the nation's third-highest-grossing 
documentary ever, excluding concert films and Imax movies -- 
behind "Fahrenheit 9/11" and "March of the Penguins."</p><p> The book version of "An Inconvenient Truth" was published 
last year as a follow-up to Gore's 1992 bestseller "Earth in 
the Balance."</p><p> Also nominated this year for best documentary were "Deliver 
Us from Evil," about a pedophile priest, "Jesus Camp," 
exploring efforts to instill evangelical Christians in 
children, and two films about the war in Iraq -- "My Country, 
My Country" and "Iraq in Fragments."</p>
