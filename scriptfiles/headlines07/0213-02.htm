<p>The House opens a marathon three-day debate today on a resolution opposing 
President Bush's decision to send 21,500 more combat troops to Iraq, a measure 
leaders of both parties agree is just the first step in Speaker Nancy Pelosi's 
bid to sharply alter the administration's war policy.

        <!--/endimage/--> The simple resolution, consisting of one long sentence, says Congress "will continue to support and protect'' the U.S. troops in Iraq, but 
disapproves of Bush's move to deploy more troops in what he admits is a 
last-ditch effort to help the Iraqi government restore order in Baghdad. 
<P>Republican House leaders attack the resolution, which mirrors a bipartisan 
measure bottled up in the Senate, as an empty political stunt. They say that if 
Democrats had political courage, they would cut off funds for the war, a step 
Pelosi has said they won't take. 

<P>Nonetheless, the Republicans plan a full-court press to oppose the 
resolution they know could resonate with an American public that polls show is 
deeply disillusioned about the president and his war policy.  
<P>Rep. Walter Jones, R-N.C., is a co-sponsor of the resolution. Estimates of 
the number of Republicans who will vote for it, signaling that they oppose 
their president's policy, range from 15 to 60. 
<P>With an edge of 233-202 seats, Democrats are sure to pass the resolution 
when the vote comes sometime Friday. Democratic leaders said all 435 House 
members, plus five delegates from territories and the District of Columbia, 
will receive five minutes each to state their views on the resolution, Bush's 
strategy for the troop increase and the war itself. 
<P>House leaders expect the debate, going late into the night, to continue 
through Thursday. The leadership of both parties has offered members talking 
points and big charts and graphs they can use as visual aids when they appear 
on the House floor live before C-SPAN's cameras. It will be the biggest debate 
on the war since the October 2002 resolution that authorized Bush to use force 
to oust Saddam Hussein. 
<P>Pelosi might open the debate this morning for the Democrats, her spokesman 
Brendan Daly said Monday, and Minority Leader John Boehner of Ohio will kick 
things off for the Republicans. 
<P>"We'll focus on certain themes,'' Daly said. "Escalation won't work. Our 
military leaders think that. And Iraq requires a political settlement.  
<P>"We will talk about the poor management of the war, the lives lost, the 
money wasted and our loss of respect around the world.''  
<P>Minority Republicans enter the debate angry that Democrats will deny them 
the chance to offer an alternative to the leadership resolution that is 
sponsored by Rep. Tom Lantos, D-San Mateo, who chairs the Foreign Affairs 
Committee, Armed Services Committee Chairman Ike Skelton, D-Mo., and Jones, an 
increasingly outspoken GOP war opponent. 
<P>Boehner had indicated that he hoped the House would be able to vote on 
legislation offered by Rep. Sam Johnson, R-Texas, saying that Congress would 
never cut off funds for a military operation as long as U.S. forces are in the 
field. Boehner has also proposed creating a bipartisan congressional panel to 
monitor how Bush's latest buildup is working. 
<P>Republican opponents of the resolution will emphasize, as Boehner does, 
that Iraq is a key front in the global war on terrorism and that victory is the 
only strategy in Iraq. They will also claim that the resolution will weaken 
U.S. troop morale. 
<P>Boehner also said he is sure that the nonbinding resolution is just the 
first move planned by Pelosi. "This resolution is the first step in the 
Democrats' plan to cut off funding for American troops who are in the field, 
and their leaders have made this abundantly clear,'' he said. 
<P>Jones agreed somewhat, although he opposes cutting off funds. "This is the 
first step to creating an end point to the war strategy. Our men and women have 
done a magnificent job, but you have got to have a goal line in Iraq and I 
don't think this administration has one.'' 
<P>Pelosi used similar language, particularly to reassure anti-war members of 
her Democratic caucus who are pushing vigorously for more action. 
<P>"This will only be the first step,'' the San Francisco Democrat said. 
<P>Next up for Pelosi is the president's $100 billion supplemental spending 
bill for the war, which is now being considered by the military appropriations 
committee headed by Rep. John Murtha, a decorated veteran and strong supporter 
of the military who adamantly opposes the president's war policy. 
<P>By March, Murtha said he plans to attach numerous conditions to the war 
money, such as a measure saying that no unit can be deployed to Iraq until it 
is fully equipped with all the latest armor and other measures designed at 
neutralizing roadside bombs. 
<P>"I will make recommendations in the bill that hopefully will change the 
direction of the war,'' Murtha said last week. 

<P>On the House floor Monday, a few Republicans previewed their line of 
attack during the three-day debate. "This resolution has already been drafted 
and put in final form. We won't be allowed to amend it,'' said Rep. Darrell 
Issa, R-Vista (San Diego County). "Democracy and debate won't change anything. 
The vote at the end of the week will be the same as at the beginning.'' 
<P>Democratic leaders, especially Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., had 
last week promised the Republicans they would get to offer an alternative 
resolution. Hoyer had also originally said that the resolution would go first 
to a joint Foreign Affairs-Armed Services Committee meeting for debate and a 
vote. 
<P>But Hoyer apparently was overruled by Pelosi and other party leaders, so 
the committee idea was dropped and the House seems all but certain to vote up 
or down on the single resolution without a GOP alternative. 
<P>On Sunday, on NBC's "Meet the Press,'' Hoyer explained the switch. 
<P>"We believe the American public wants a straightforward answer to the 
question, 'Do you agree with the president's proposal?' 
<P>"A Republican president has made a proposal, we're going to respond to 
that, and we want to respond to it with great clarity.''
