suspicious to Sarah Olson. He had called to ask the Oakland freelance 
journalist about the accuracy of quotes in her story about Lt. Ehren Watada, 
which had appeared on the liberal Web site Truthout.org. 
<P>As the telephone conversation progressed, Olson realized that the military 
was using her to fortify its case against Watada, whom it was prosecuting as 
the first commissioned officer to refuse deployment to Iraq and who had spoken 
candidly to Olson. While Watada faces a court-martial next month for conduct 
unbecoming an officer, the U.S. military pursues Olson.

    Last month, military prosecutors subpoenaed the 31-year-old writer and 
radio journalist, asking her to appear at his court-martial, scheduled to begin 
next month, to verify what Watada said. If Olson doesn't testify, she faces six 
months in jail or a $500 fine and a felony charge for a story she was paid $300 
to write.  
<P>It isn't uncommon for journalists to appear in civil and criminal court to 
answer what military prosecutors are asking Olson: Is your reporting accurate? 
A spokesman at Fort Lewis, in Washington state, where Watada's pretrial 
proceedings began Thursday, said that prosecutors would "probably be OK" with 
her answering in an affidavit. 
<P>But Olson doesn't want to be part of a legal action that she believes 
limits someone's free speech.  
<P>She came to journalism six years ago through a media reform-activism 
channel, hoping to create more places for dissenting or seldom-heard voices, 
not fewer. Although she paused several times during an interview this week at 
an Oakland cafe seeking reassurance that the story would not paint her as "some 
sort of martyr," she is sure of the principle in which she roots her case. 
<P>"Journalists should not be asked to participate in the prosecution of 
political speech," Olson said. "Dragging a journalist into court like this ... 
really damages the barrier between press and government. When speech is the 
crime, the journalist really can be the investigative arm, the eyes and ears of 
the government." 
<P>Would she be as passionate about not testifying in court if she had been 
reporting the views of, say, a Nazi? Yes, Olson said. "I'm kind of hard core 
about the First Amendment." 

<P>Although Olson is not the only journalist whom federal officials are 
trying to coerce information from, some First Amendment advocates and military 
justice experts are somewhat baffled as to why prosecutors continue to chase 
her. Military officials aren't asking her to turn over her notes or unpublished 
material. And it's not as though a 30-second Google search couldn't provide 
prosecutors with an iPod-full of audio and video of Watada's numerous anti-war 
statements since his first news conference in June.  
<P>She is going into a military court, where free speech hasn't traditionally 
had the same protections as in the civilian world. If Watada were a civilian 
and said, "The war in Iraq is not only morally wrong but a horrible breach of 
American law," as he did in his June news conference, he wouldn't be facing six 
years in a military prison for conduct unbecoming to an officer and for missing 
a troop movement.  
<P>Are they chasing a freelancer who doesn't have the deep corporate pockets 
to fund a fight? Probably not, said Olson's lawyer, David Greene, of the First 
Amendment Project. He noted that prosecutors also subpoenaed Gregg Kakesako, 
military affairs reporter for the Honolulu Star-Bulletin.  
<P>While First Amendment advocates say it isn't uncommon for journalists to 
testify in civil and some criminal cases about the accuracy of their reporting, 
military law expert Eugene Fidell said it is the first military case he's heard 
of involving free speech issues.   
<P>"What I don't understand is why they (prosecutors) can't get this 
information digitally or from somewhere else," said Fidell, president of the 
National Institute of Military Justice. He has been involved in military cases 
since 1969. "It is a really interesting case."  
<P>But Fort Lewis spokesman Joseph Piek said that even though Watada hasn't 
been shy about stating his anti-war objections in news conferences, speeches 
and stories, "just having a news clipping or a videotape doesn't fully meet the 
rules of evidence." 
<P>Unlike the 10 prominent reporters expected to be subpoenaed this week in 
the high-profile CIA leak case involving top White House aide Lewis "Scooter" 
Libby, Olson isn't backed by a major media corporation. She has a day job as a 
technical writer and is being represented pro bono by the First Amendment 
Project in Oakland.  
<P>In media circles, her case has not become a rallying point for a federal 
shield law, as has that of Chronicle reporters Mark Fainaru-Wada and Lance 
Williams, who face jail time for refusing to reveal who leaked them 
confidential grand jury testimony about elite athletes' use of 
performance-enhancing drugs. And since Olson isn't being asked to reveal 
unpublished work, her case differs from that of Josh Wolf, the San Francisco 
journalist who has spent four months in prison for refusing to give prosecutors 
outtakes of videos he took at a protest last year. 
<P>Still, her case is starting to draw attention. 
<P>"I'm always concerned when a reporter is subpoenaed to tell what they 
know," said Peter Scheer, of the California First Amendment Coalition. "But I'm 
least concerned when they are asked to verify something that has appeared in a 
story."  
<P>Olson doesn't have a problem with journalists testifying in court. She 
doesn't want journalists to be coerced to testify in cases that could limit 
free speech. "What could be more hostile to the idea of a free press," Olson 
wrote in a recent commentary, "than a journalist participating in the 
suppression of newsworthy speech?" 
<P>It's a stance that has evolved along with Olson's interest in journalism. 
The New Hampshire native came to the Bay Area eight years ago "totally 
randomly," she said, joining a couple of friends here after majoring in women's 
studies at Simmons College in Boston. After a few temp jobs, she gravitated to 
the media reform community and its focus on how media consolidations limit the 
number of voices in the marketplace. 
<P>She got her start five years ago at the low-power pirate radio station San 
Francisco Liberation Radio and worked her way up to become a regular 
contributor to national progressive radio outlets like Pacifica Radio and Free 
Speech Radio. 
<P>What drives Olson is telling the stories of dissenters and those outside 
the mainstream who don't get traditional press attention. She has primarily 
covered the anti-war movement but also has done pieces on anti-abortion 
activists in Mississippi and anti-death-penalty activists. This week her story 
about doulas who assist pregnant women in prison is expected to air on KPFA-FM 
in Berkeley.  
<P>Olson's 2,500-word piece about the clean-cut officer who called the war 
immoral and illegal appeared on June 7, the same day Watada called a news 
conference to announce his decision not to deploy. His story was picked up by 
several local outlets, and eventually a few major national outlets. She hasn't 
written about the Watada case for the past couple of months since, as she put 
it, "I became part of the story."  
<P>Olson has spent the months since that phone call emotionally preparing 
herself for the possibility of prison. Her boyfriend, parents and her 
grandfather, a military veteran, are supportive.  
<P>Granted, she probably wouldn't be as willing to go to jail if, she said, 
"the story was about, say, Dick Cheney." Not necessarily because Cheney and 
Watada don't share the same political views, but because Cheney "has many other 
avenues to get out his message."
