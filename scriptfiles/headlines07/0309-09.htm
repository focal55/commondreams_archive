<p>MANY HAD WRITTEN off the chances that Arundhati Roy would return
to the world of fiction. Her astounding first novel, <i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0060977493/commondreams-20/ref=nosim/" target="_new">The God of
Small Things</a></i>, won the Booker in 1997. Ten years and 6 million
copies later there was still no repeat of the lyrical, whirling
debut. Instead Roy turned to lobbing literary Molotov cocktails at
Enron, George Bush's war on terror and the World Trade Organisation
in the form of incendiary polemics. No one could accuse her of
having writers' block: she churned out six books, collections of
her essays with titles such as <i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0896086682?tag=commondreams-20&camp=0&creative=0&linkCode=as1&creativeASIN=0896086682&adid=0XSTJG1T15HCM7RRWHYG&" target="_new">Power Politics</a> </i>and<i> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0896087271/commondreams-20/ref=nosim/" target="_new">An Ordinary
Person's Guide to Empire</a></i>.</p>

        <!--/endimage/-->Dispensing with story-writing, she pursued a career in social
activism, appearing at anti-war rallies and using her celebrity to
raise the profiles of unfashionable causes - Kashmiris on death
row, the rights of tribal communities in India, hardscrabble
suicides in the country's farming belt.</p>
<p>But recently the 45-year-old quietly announced that she would be
stepping back from the public stage to write her second novel. The
last person to know, apparently, was her agent, David Godwin, who
had negotiated for her a million-dollar advance for <i>The God of
Small Things</i>. "David rang me saying, 'Why did you not tell me?
I have had hundreds of calls from publishers.' I thought it was so
funny, I mean let's have a bidding war for a non-existent book,"
Roy says.</p>
<p>Sitting in her Delhi rooftop flat, whose dark tiled and light
wood-lined interior the former architecture student designed, Roy
says she has already begun writing the new novel but has no idea
when it will be finished. The whisper was that it would be about
Kashmir, the revolt-scarred Himalayan state, but Roy shakes her
head sending ripples through her grey-flecked curls. "It is not
true. My fiction is never about an issue. I don't set myself some
political task and weave a story around it. I might as well write a
straightforward nonfiction piece if that is what I wanted to
do."</p>
<p>A clue about where Roy is heading may be gleaned from her
current reading. On her coffee table rests a book by Bono, while at
her bedside are works by the radical American founding father
Thomas Paine and Victorian novelist Charles Dickens. What these two
writers share is their defence of the French Revolution, and an
empathy with the lower classes who pulled down the ruling elite.
"In so many ways Paris then could be Delhi now. It is a conceit to
think that all that we say is new and original."</p>
<p>
Roy says India today, like pre-revolutionary France, is poised "on the edge of violence". As she sees it, the country of her birth
is not coming together but coming apart - convulsed by "corporate
globalisation" at an unprecedented, unacceptable velocity. "The
inequalities become untenable."</p>

<p>Roy says she is not taking refuge from her politics in the world
of literature. She answers her own door and makes guests tea
herself, remarkable in a country where even middle-class households
have servants. She is still married to filmmaker Pradip Krishen but
the flat is "her space". He lives in another house.</p>
<p>"Living with my own contradictions is hard enough - forcing my
political views on someone else, on their lifestyle and the choices
they make is not something I want to do. It distorts a relationship
beyond redemption. So, I decided to have my own place."</p>
<p>Roy's dire predictions about India have left her isolated when
mainstream opinion seems convinced that the country, with its
nuclear bombs and slick Bollywood movies, is the next
superpower-in-waiting. Roy says some parts of the country, such as
the western state of Gujarat - the scene of a bloody pogrom against
Muslims five years ago - are off limits to her because of her
campaigning.</p>

<p>A few years ago she was briefly imprisoned for contempt of court
while protesting against the country's controversial Narmada Dam
project. <i>The God of Small Things</i> produced obscenity
charges and a court case that ran for a decade, only to be
dismissed last month.</p>
<p>She first shot to prominence in 1994 with a scathing film review
entitled <i>The Great Indian Rape Trick</i>, about the movie
<i>Bandit Queen</i>, in which she questioned the right to
"restage the rape of a living woman without her permission".</p>
<p>Roy has been consistent in her view that writers have a
responsibility to their subjects. She says she could not read the
blockbuster <i>Maximum City</i>, a portrait of Mumbai by
expatriate Indian writer Suketu Mehta, because the book contains a
passage in which the writer is a bystander while people in custody
are beaten and tortured by the city's police.</p>
<p>"When you witness torture you are seeing someone humiliated. In
front of you. It is not a neutral act. Certainly you have the
permission of the torturer, but you do not have the permission of
the tortured [to record it]."</p>

<p>Unlike other Indian-born writers who have relocated to the US
and Europe, Roy is determined to remain a thorn in the side of the
establishment in India. "Here you see what's happening. People are
driven out of villages, driven out of the cities, there's a kind of
insanity in the air and all of it held down by our mesmeric,
pelvic-thrusting Bollywood movies. The Indian middle class has just
embarked on this orgy of consumerism."</p></div><p>But she admits that the kinds of non-violent protests she has
taken part in for a decade have failed in India, a republic founded
on the Gandhi-ite principles of peaceful resistance. "I am not such
an uninhibited fan of Gandhi. After all, Gandhi was a superstar.
When he went on a hunger strike he was a superstar on a hunger
strike. But I don't believe in superstar politics. If people in a
slum are on a hunger strike, no one gives a shit."</p>
<p>Roy says activists have been "exhausted" by their attempts to
influence the courts and the press and now says she does not
"condemn people taking up arms" in the face of state
repression.</p>
<p>"It would be immoral for me to preach violence unless I were
prepared to resort to it myself. But equally, it is immoral for me
to advocate feelgood marches and hunger strikes when I'm not
bearing the brunt of unspeakable violence. I certainly do not
volunteer to tell Iraqis or Kashmiris or Palestinians that if they
went on a mass hunger strike they would get rid of the military
occupation. Civil disobedience doesn't seem to be paying
dividends."</p>
<p>Instead of the Indian state caving in to the moral righteousness
of the numerous causes Roy supports, she says it merely moved to
co-opt its adversaries. The power of argument, even in the world's
biggest democracy, has been shrunk by the argument of power.</p>
<p>Roy says she was aghast to learn that a fellow Indian
environmental campaigner accepted a million-dollar award from the
transnational metals firm Alcan, which has been accused of grabbing
tribal land in eastern India. The tentacles of big business have
learned to embrace non-government organisations. The result, she
claims, is that the charitable trusts of Tata, India's largest
private company, fund "half the activists in the country".</p>
<p>She feels frustrated by the state's ability to brush aside
non-violent resistance movements. "This has sapped the energy from
people's movements. The very Gandhian Narmada movement [the
grassroots group which campaigned against big dams in India]
knocked on the door of every democratic institution for years and
has been humiliated. It has not managed to stop a single dam from
going ahead. In fact the dam industry has a new spring in its
step."</p>
<p>Roy says she had given ideological opponents a handy hate
figure. "In India I'm portrayed more as a hysterical, lying,
anti-national harridan.</p>
<p>"In this adversarial game that goes on, you can get pinned down
to spewing facts and numbers, but those are not the only truths ...
I've done that. I've fought that battle," she says. "But the
distillation of those things into literature is a different kind of
intervention."</p>
