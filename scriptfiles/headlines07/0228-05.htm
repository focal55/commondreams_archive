<p>WASHINGTON  - The U.S.-backed Iraqi cabinet approved a new 
oil law Monday that is set to give foreign companies the long-term 
contracts and safe legal framework they have been waiting for, but which 
has rattled labor unions and international campaigners who say oil 
production should remain in the hands of Iraqis.

Independent analysts and labor groups have also criticized the process of 
drafting the law and warned that that the bill is so skewed in favor of 
foreign firms that it could end up heightening political tensions in the 
Arab nation and spreading instability.</p>
<p>For example, it specifies that up to two-thirds of Iraq's known reserves 
would be developed by multinationals, under contracts lasting for 15 to 20 
years.</p>
<p>This policy would represent a u-turn for Iraq's oil industry, which has 
been in the public sector for more than three decades, and would break 
from normal practice in the Middle East.
</p>
<p>According to local labor leaders, transferring ownership to the foreign 
companies would give a further pretext to continue the U.S. occupation on 
the grounds that those companies will need protection.</p>
<p>Union leaders have complained that they, along with other civil society 
groups, were left out of the drafting process despite U.S. claims it has 
created a functioning democracy in Iraq.</p>
<p>Under the production-sharing agreements provided for in the draft law, 
companies will not come under the jurisdiction of Iraqi courts in the 
event of a dispute, nor to the general auditor.</p>
<p>The ownership of the oil reserves under this draft law will remain with 
the state in form, but not in substance, critics say.</p>
<p>On Feb. 8, the labor unions sent a letter in Arabic to Iraqi President 
Jalal Talbani urging him to reconsider this kind of agreement.</p>
<p>"Production-sharing agreements are a relic of the 1960s," said the letter, 
seen by IPS. "They will re-imprison the Iraqi economy and impinge on 
Iraq's sovereignty since they only preserve the interests of foreign 
companies. We warn against falling into this trap."</p>
<p>Ewa Jasiewicz, a researcher at PLATFORM, a British human rights and 
environmental group that monitors the oil industry, told IPS in a phone 
interview from London that,
"First of all, it hasn't been put together in any kind of democratic 
process... It's been put through a war and an occupation which in itself 
is a grotesquely undemocratic process."</p>
<p>The law was prepared by a three-member Iraqi cabinet committee, dominated 
by the Kurds and the Shiites. It is now expected to be ratified by 
parliament because the powerful faction leaders in the government have 
cleared it.</p>
<p>
The first draft was seen only by the committee of the Iraqi technocrat who 
penned it, nine international oil companies, the British and the U.S. 
governments and the International Monetary Fund. The Iraqi parliament will 
get its first glimpse next week.</p>
<p>Concerns about the process are compounded because of the ongoing disputes 
in Iraq over the legitimacy of the Iraqi cabinet and the Iraqi parliament, 
which have been constructed by the occupation-created governing council, 
which itself was created in 2004 along sectarian lines.</p>
<p>In a speech earlier this month by Hassan Juma, head of the Iraqi Oil 
labor Union, posted on the union's website, he called on the Iraqi 
government to consult with Iraqi oil experts and "ask their opinion before 
sinking Iraq into an ocean of dark injustice."</p>
<p>The content of the law has also worried both international campaigners and 
local Iraqi groups who say that it puts Iraqi oil wealth firmly on the 
path to full privatization.</p>
<p>"The hydrocarbon law reflects the process of readying Iraq's oil for 
privatization," said Jasiewicz. "Drafted in secret, shaped by foreign 
powers, untransparent, undemocratic and forced through under military 
occupation."</p>
<p>Jasiewicz said the law can be regarded as the economic goal of the war and 
occupation and that "it will be viewed by most Iraqis as not just 
illegitimate, but a war crime."</p>
<p>But officials from the Iraqi government, who have already sent the draft 
oil law to parliament for consideration, say it represents a step forward 
for the war-torn country. Under the law, oil revenues would be distributed 
to all 18 provinces based on population size, and regional administrations 
have the authority to negotiate contracts with international oil 
companies.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, a close ally of Washington, called the law 
"another founding stone in state-building."</p>
<p>"This law will guarantee for Iraqis, not just now but for future 
generations too, complete national control over this natural wealth," Oil 
Minister Hussain al-Shahristani has reportedly said.
</p>
<p>Initial drafts of the law starting eight months ago saw squabbles between 
the Kurdish factions who control the northern part of Iraq and the 
Shiite-led regime, as they both vied for bigger shares of the country's 
oil wealth, estimated at 115 billion barrels. That they have finally come 
to a final agreement may be a sign of long-sought stability.</p>
<p>Yet critics, including Iraqi oil professionals, engineers and technicians 
in the unions, are instead advocating for technical service contracts, 
meaning a company would come in and offer services such as building a 
refinery, laying a pipeline, or offering consultancy services, get their 
fees and then leave.</p>
<p>"It is a much more equitable relationship because the control of 
production, development of oil will stay with the Iraqi state," said 
Jasiewicz.</p>
<p>"That is the model that Saudi Arabia, Iran, Kuwait generally operate. 
There's no other country in the Middle East with the kind of oil reserves 
that Iraq has that would consider signing a production-sharing agreement," 
she said. "It's a form of privatization and that's why those countries 
haven't signed these because it's not in their interests."</p>
