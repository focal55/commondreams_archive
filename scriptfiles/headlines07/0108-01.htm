<p>Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki's disregard of criticism over the handling of Saddam Hussein's execution was reminiscent of the former regime itself which grossly violated human rights, the New York-based Human Rights Watch said.
<p>Human Rights Watch (HRW), which tracked the crimes of the former regime headed by Saddam, came down heavily on Maliki for his critical remarks made on Saturday brushing off criticisms over the ex-Iraqi leader's hanging on December 30.</p>

<p>At an Iraqi army function Maliki sternly said that hanging Saddam was an internal affair and criticisms of the execution were "inciting sedition and constituted flagrant interference in the internal affairs of Iraq."</p>
<p>A statement from HRW said this stand by Maliki recalled Saddam's era.</p>
<p>"Human Rights Watch was critical of remarks made on January 6 by Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki, who said that Saddam Hussein did not deserve a fair trial and that his hanging was a domestic affair carried out for the purpose of Iraqi unity," HRW said in the statement. </p>
<p>"Al-Maliki went on to say that criticisms of the execution were tantamount to inciting sedition and constituted flagrant interference in the internal affairs of Iraq."</p>
<p>"Human Rights Watch recalls comparable statements from Hussein's former Baath party regime in attempting to rebuff criticisms of its horrific human rights violations."</p>
<p>Saddam was hanged at a former torture centre in Baghdad but minutes before his hanging he was taunted by an alleged Shiite guard which has led to massive protests among Iraq's Sunni Muslim community and also raised a strong international outcry.</p>
<p>The human rights watchdog also called for stopping the planned executions of two of Saddam's henchmen which are expected to be carried out this week.</p>
<p>The executions of Barzan Ibrahim al-Tikrit and Awad Ahmed al-Bandar further highlight "the Iraqi government's disturbing disregard for human rights and the rule of law," HRW said.</p>
<p>Iraqi government spokesman Ali al-Dabbagh told the BBC's Arabic service Sunday that the two could be executed in two days.</p>

<p>Apart from Saddam, Barzan and Bandar were found guilty of ordering the killing of 148 Shiite villagers from Dujail in the 1980s.</p>
<p>"The execution of these two, however henious the crimes involved, is cruel and inhuman punishment that will only drag a deeply flawed process into even greater disrepute," said HRW director Richard Dicker.</p>
<p>The watchdog said the executions of the two former Saddam henchmen follow questions about whether proper procedures were adhered to in the hanging of the former president himself.</p>
<p>Citing media reports the HRW pointed out that Saddam's execution was not ratified by the three-member Iraqi presidency council.</p>
<p>"The haste and vengeance infusing Saddam Hussein’s hanging should prompt the Iraqi government to halt these executions," said Dicker.</p>
<p>"Saddam Hussein’s hanging, which obscured his unspeakable human rights record, shocked the world and is raising questions about this government's commitment to fundamental human rights."</p>
<p>Iraqi President Jalal Talabani however has distanced himself from the execution of Saddam, saying he had not needed to give his approval for it and had not known when it was to take place.</p>
<p>A statement from Talabani's spokesman last week said the president does not "interfere in the independence of the judiciary, especially in the case where he doesn't have that right, as is the case in decisions of this court."</p>
<p>The statement also quoted a letter written by Talabani to the Iraqi cabinet explaining his stance.</p>

<p>"Article 137 of the constitution doesn't give the president the right to issue a pardon or to alleviate a decision concerning crimes of international jurisdiction" such as crimes against humanity, he added.</p>
<p>Saddam's execution order was confirmed on December 26 by a panel of appeal court judges and was signed off on by Maliki on December 30 shortly before the ousted dictator was hanged.</p>
<p>Some experts argue, however, that the decisions of the Iraqi High Tribunal that sentenced Saddam do not need presidential approval. Others argue that it was unconstitutional to hang him without that approval.</p>
