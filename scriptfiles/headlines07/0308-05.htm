<p> A worldwide
warning about the risks of eating mercury-contaminated fish is to be
issued by an international group of scientists today. <p> Three times more mercury is falling from the sky than before the Industrial Revolution 200 years ago, the scientists say.</p>
<p>Fish absorb the toxic chemical, which pollutes the seas, posing a
risk especially to children and women of childbearing age. The role of
low-level pollutants such as lead and mercury on the growing brain has
been known for decades and measures have been taken to reduce exposure
to a minimum. But the scientists say more must be done.</p>
<p>The warning is based on five papers by mercury specialists
summarising the current state of knowledge on the chemical published in
the international science journal Ambio. Called the Madison Declaration
on Mercury Pollution, it presents 33 key findings from four expert
panels over the past year. Every member of the four panels backed the
declaration which was endorsed by more than 1,000 scientists at an
international conference on mercury pollution in Madison, Wisconsin, in
the US last August.</p>
<p>However, it runs counter to research by British scientists last
month which found pregnant women who ate the most fish had children who
were more advanced, with higher IQs and better physical abilities.</p>

<p>The British researchers said that while mercury is known to harm
brain development, fish also contain omega-3 fatty acids and other
nutrients which are essential to brain development. They studied 9,000
families taking part in the Children of the 90s project at the
University of Bristol and concluded, in The Lancet, that the risks of
eating fish were outweighed by the benefits.</p>
<p>The US scientists focused on the risks of mercury which they say now
constitute a "public health problem in most regions of the world". In
addition to its toxic effects on the human foetus, new evidence
indicates it may increase the risk of heart disease, particularly in
adult men.</p>
<p>While developed countries have reduced mercury emissions over the
past 30 years, these have been offset by increased emissions from
developing nations.</p>
<p>The uncontrolled use of the metal in small-scale gold mining is
contaminating thousands of sites around the world, putting 50 million
inhabitants of mining regions at risk and contributing 10 per cent of
the global burden of the pollutant attributable to human activities in
the atmosphere.</p>
<p>The global spread of the threat is revealed in increased mercury
concentrations now being detected in fish-eating species in remote
areas of the planet. The impact on marine eco-systems may lead to
population declines in these species and in fish stocks.</p>
<p>Professor James Wiener, of the University of Wisconsin, said: "The
policy implications of these findings are clear. Effective national and
international policies are needed to combat this global problem."</p>
<p>In the US, official government advice is for pregnant women to limit
their consumption of all seafood, including white fish, oily fish and
shellfish, to no more than 12oz (340g) a week in order to limit their
exposure to mercury.</p>
<p>In the UK, the Food Standards Agency advises expectant mothers to
avoid shark, swordfish and marlin and to limit their consumption of
tuna, because these are the fish with the highest levels of mercury.</p>
<p><b> The key findings</b></p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Three times more mercury is falling from the sky today than before the Industrial Revolution<br>
</li>
<li>Eating fish is the primary way most people are exposed to the toxic metal<br>
</li>
<li>There is solid scientific evidence of the toxic effects of mercury on the developing foetus<br>
</li>
<li>Mercury exposure now constitutes a public health problem in most regions of the world<br>
</li>
<li>New evidence suggests exposure to mercury may increase the risk of heart disease and stroke in men<br>
</li>
<li>Increased mercury emissions from developing countries over the past 30 years have outstripped declines in the developed world<br>
</li>
<li>Increasing mercury concentrations are now being detected in fish-eating wildlife in remote areas of the planet</li>
</ul>
