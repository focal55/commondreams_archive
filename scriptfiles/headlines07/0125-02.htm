        Environmentalists are unimpressed with George Bush's pledge to develop alternative sources of energy - accusing him of failing to confront the real issues driving climate change.

GREENPEACE: BUSH REMAINS DELUSIONAL <br>

In his address on Tuesday, Mr Bush called for a large boost in the 
  production of alternative fuels, along with an increase in efficiency 
  standards for petrol-engine vehicles. "These technologies will help us 
  be better stewards of the environment, and they will help us to confront the 
  serious challenge of global climate change," he said.
</p>
<p>
  Mr Bush recommended a five-fold increase in the production of ethanol and 
  other alternative fuels. He said that increase in production - up to 35 
  billion gallons by 2017 - would replace about 15 per cent of annual petrol 
  use. Taken with other reforms, including an annual4 per cent increase in 
  vehicle efficiency standards starting in 2010, Mr Bush said his plan could 
  reduce petrol consumption by 20 per cent over the next decade.
</p>
<p>
  But activists said yesterday that however impressive Mr Bush's plans may 
  have sounded - especially given his reputation for intransigence over issues 
  such as the Kyoto treaty - they offered little in substance.

</p>
<p>
  "There is no revolution in global warming policy in anything the 
  President is proposing, no matter how the White House tries to spin it,"
   said Philip Clapp, the president of the National Environmental Trust. "
  The numbers are calculated to sound big and impressive but the President is 
  being just as intransigent on global warming as he is on Iraq, ignoring 
  Congress, major business leaders, and the public, who have called for action.
  "
</p>
<p>
  He added: "The President's proposals will contribute almost nothing to 
  stopping global warming. They will allow our carbon emissions to grow by 14 
  per cent over the next 10 years."
</p>
<p>
  Others welcomed Mr Bush's acknowledgement of the threat of global warming 
  but warned that some of his proposals could do more harm than good.
</p>
<p>
  "Wrongheaded approaches would prove counter-productive - we could end 
  up with somewhat more efficient vehicles running on much dirtier fuels that 
  further accelerate global warming," said Frances Beinecke, the 
  president of the Natural Resources Defence Council. "Turning coal into 
  liquid transportation fuel, for instance, would generate nearly twice the 
  amount of global-warming pollution that today's petroleum-based fuels do.
</p>

<p>
  "Similarly, producing alternative fuels such as ethanol from wood chips 
  that come from endangered forests could inflict widespread ecological damage.
  "

Environmentalists remain sceptical of the benefits of ethanol production, 
  which would provide a boost to US corn growers but which may do little to 
  ease carbon emissions. While burning ethanol produced by corn is "
  carbon neutral" - it releases the carbon it has stored during its 
  growth - production of ethanol requires fossil fuels. "Transportation 
  of the fuels, processing of the fuels - all that requires energy which is 
  currently driven by a fossil-fuel economy. So all these biofuels projects 
  currently add to the greenhouse-gas effect," said Jan Kowalzig of 
  Friends of the Earth Europe.
</p>
<p>
  Campaigners said it was of equal importance that Mr Bush failed to talk 
  about a cap on carbon emissions - something his administration has always 
  opposed, despite calls for such a limit both inside and outside the US. "
He remains delusional," Greenpeace's Steve Sawyer told the Agence France 
  Presse news agency.
</p>
<p>
  Others welcomed Mr Bush's comments. Sir Nicholas Stern, the chief economic 
  adviser to the British Government and the author of a report that warned of 
  the rising costs of climate change, said at the World Economic Forum in 
  Davos, Switzerland: "There is a recognition of the link between climate 
  change and human activity. You have to recognise what everyone is doing."</p>
<p>

  <b>Biofuels explained</b>
</p>
<p>
  The idea behind biofuel is that you are exploiting a sustainable source of 
  energy in the form of the carbohydrates stored within a cereal crop - in 
  this case, maize.
</p>
<p>
  Plants are able to convert the energy of sunlight into carbohydrates by the 
  process of photosynthesis, which also led to fossil fuel production hundreds 
  of millions of years ago.
</p>
<p>
  The carbohydrates of biofuel crops are fermented into ethanol, that can be 
  burnt in car engines converted for the task. It produces less pollution than 
  petrol but still emits greenhouse gases.
</p>
<p>

  In theory, the process should not add to the overall level of atmospheric 
  CO2 - subsequent biofuel crops would absorb most of the emissions when they 
  are growing. But industrialised countries rely on fossil fuel to farm arable 
  crops.
