NEW YORK - A U.S. plan to develop a new
hydrogen bomb could spark production of new nuclear weapons by other
countries, including several foes of the Bush administration, warn some
of the nation's leading arms control and disarmament advocacy groups.

        <!--/endimage/-->Last Friday, the Department of Energy announced it was seeking to
develop a new hydrogen bomb that would replace the existing W76 warhead
now deployed on submarine-launched ballistic missiles.</p>
<p>Many analysts say the Bush administration's plan would undermine
international efforts to control the spread of nuclear arms and would
provide justification to those countries currently suspected of trying
to build such weapons. </p>
<p>"It will not convince the Iranian Scylla, North Korean Charybdis, or
any other less attention-grabbing nascent nuclear state that the U.S.
is serious about dampening the political value of nuclear weapons in
its security policy," says Travis Sharp, a research fellow at the
Washington, DC-based Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation. </p>
<p>The Bush administration has justified the move by arguing that the
condition of existing warheads essentially demands that a new hydrogen
bomb be developed in the next two decades, but experts on nuclear
weapons find this line of reasoning out of step with reality on the
ground. </p>
<p>"The administration claims [it] is necessary in order to maintain
long-term confidence in the future stockpile," says John Isaacs, "but
the fact is that the U.S. stockpile has been confirmed 'safe and
reliable' for at least another half century," noting that the
effectiveness of the existing stockpile is based on 50 years of
research and over 1,000 underground nuclear tests.</p>
<p>Other nuclear policy experts agree with Isaacs' view that the plan to build the new hydrogen bomb is unjustified. </p>
<p>"The main reason for new nuclear weapons--possible uncertainties
about whether the specified projected yield of the existing weapons
would remain precisely reliable--was recently invalidated by both the
national nuclear weapon labs scientists and independent experts," says
Leonor Tomero, a non-proliferation policy expert at the Center. </p>
<p>Last November, a study carried out by American weapons laboratories
and reviewed by JASON, an independent government advisory body of
nuclear scientists, revealed that plutonium pits (the cores that
trigger nuclear weapons) remain viable for at least 90 years. </p>
<p>"The concern was never that the existing weapons would not
detonate," according to Tomero, "the concern was that the weapons would
not detonate at their precise expected yield. Even that is no longer a
valid concern now." </p>

<p>Despite the end of the Cold War in 1991, the United States continues
to possess thousands of nuclear weapons. In addition to the United
States, other major powers that have built huge nuclear arsenals
include Russia, Britain, France, and China. </p>
<p>Currently the five countries combined have more than 36,000 nuclear
warheads in their possession, according to the Stockholm International
Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), a Sweden-based think tank.</p>
<p>In addition to the declared nuclear powers, India, Pakistan, and
Israel are also believed to be in possession of hundreds of nuclear
weapons and at this point, unlike Iran, which has joined international
agreements against the spread of nuclear weapons, none of them seems
willing to join the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.</p>
<p>As Iran continues to claim that it has no intention to build nuclear
weapons, in response to Western criticisms and suspicions surrounding
its nuclear program it often points out the presence of thousands of
nuclear weapons in the possession of the United States. </p>
<p>On Monday, a new report from a leading British scientist concluded
that a military strike, rather than setting back Iran's nuclear
program, could actually speed up the country's production of a nuclear
weapon.</p>
<p>"[It] would certainly lead to a fast-track program to develop a
small number of nuclear devices as quickly as possible," said Dr. Frank
Barry, the report's author, about the likely Iranian reaction to any
U.S. military action.</p>
<p>Sponsored by the Oxford Research Group, an independent charity based
in Britain, the study concluded that if Iran was moving toward
nuclear-weapon capacity, it was doing so "relatively slowly," with most
estimates suggesting that no weapon would be produced within the next
five years. </p>
<p>In his report, Dr. Barry argued that it is "much more likely" that,
following an attack, all resources would be focused on the manufacture
of "one or two crude" devices. "This realignment of Iran's nuclear
program towards a so-called 'crash program' could lead to a nuclear
armed Iran within one or two years," he said. </p><p>
The report's conclusions were fully backed by Dr. Hans Blix, the former
UN chief nuclear inspector and head of the International Atomic Energy
Agency (IAEA).

</p><p>"Armed attacks on Iran would very likely lead to the results
they were meant to avoid--the building of nuclear weapons in three
years," Blix said in a foreword to the report. </p><p>
In addition to their concerns about the negative implications for
non-proliferation, some critics in Washington, such as Isaacs, worry
that the focus of George W. Bush's new nuclear policy could harm U.S.
interests.
</p><p>"Costly warheads won't help the U.S. win the counterinsurgency
campaigns in Iraq and Afghanistan," says Isaacs, "and non-state actors
like al Qaeda do not respond to classic Cold War state-to-state nuclear
deterrence." </p><p>
For this fiscal year, Bush is seeking more than $118 million to fund
development of the new nuclear weapons (also known as the Reliable
Replacement Warhead program).
</p><p>Noting that Bush's request for the new weapons is almost five
times greater than the amount he asked for last year, experts at the
Center say costs are likely to go much higher as the new weapons
program moves into the production phase between 2009 and 2012. </p><p>
Last Friday the Los Angeles Times reported that over the next two
decades the cost of developing the new bomb might grow into the tens of
billions of dollars</p><P align="center"></span>Copyright &copy; 2007 OneWorld.net
