<p>WASHINGTON - The U.S. State Department's annual Human Rights 
Reports, released Tuesday in Washington, points to the humanitarian 
disaster in Sudan and the failure of Pakistan's President Pervez Musharraf 
to improve his country's human rights record as some of the concerning 
trends in international human rights over the past year.</p>

The report starts with an admission that actions taken by the U.S. in the 
"Global War on Terror" have taken a toll on the United States' reputation 
as a proponent of the United Nation's Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights.</p>

<p>The latest edition of the Country Reports, which were first mandated by 
Congress in 1976, covers the human rights situations of nearly 200 
countries in 2006 and stretches more than 3,000 pages in length.</p>

<p>As in past years, this year's report does not address rights conditions in 
the United States or in U.S.-controlled facilities overseas, such as 
detention centres at the Guantanamo Bay naval base and in Afghanistan 
where Washington has been holding suspects in its "war on terror" in 
conditions that some human rights monitors, including several U.N. Special 
Rapporteurs, have said amount to "torture".</p>

<p>Countries singled out as making significant improvements over the past 
year included Liberia, Morocco, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Haiti, 
Ukraine, and Kyrgyzstan.</p>

<p>All of these countries were held up as examples of nations with improving 
human rights records but with significant steps still required to bring 
them up to an internationally acceptable standard.</p>

<p>(A new study on Liberia by ActionAid, an international development agency 
based in South Africa, came to a different conclusion this week, saying 
that "violence against women and rape continue unchecked" in the country.)</p>

<p>Pakistan, Egypt, Kazakhstan, Russia, Venezuela, Fiji, and Thailand were 
discussed as examples of countries that have turned to greater government 
centralisation and a decline in transparent, democratic governance.</p>

<p>
Venezuela's President Hugo Chavez and the George W. Bush administration 
have traded barbs during the past year over disagreements regarding the 
neoliberal development strategies encouraged by the United States in Latin 
America and Chavez's expansion of state control over the energy industries 
in Venezuela.</p>

<p>Pakistan, Egypt, Kazakhstan, Russia and Thailand, are all close partners 
of the United States in the "global war on terror" and several are rumored 
to be sites for CIA "black sites" or countries where U.S. prisoners have 
been sent for torture.</p>

<p>"While Amnesty International welcomes the reports' emphasis on 
accountability, until the United States changes its own policies of 
holding detainees indefinitely, in secret prisons and without basic 
rights, it cannot credibly be viewed as a world human rights leader," said 
Amnesty International USA executive director Larry Cox, in a press 
release. "Human rights abuses must not be hidden behind a façade of 
national security rhetoric."</p>

<p>Criticisms of countries' treatment of prisoners and interrogation 
techniques do raise questions about the U.S.'s own treatment of prisoners 
and detainees. "There is a disconnect between the words of the report and 
America's actions in the world," Tom Malinowski, the Washington director 
of Human Rights Watch, told IPS.</p>

<p>"Today's reports provide useful data that should be factored into foreign 
policy decisions," said Cox. "However, if the Bush administration persists 
in allowing other considerations to trump human rights concerns, the 
real-world impact of these reports will be greatly diminished."</p>

<p>Countries that have made dramatic steps backwards in both human rights and 
democratic government included: Iraq, Afghanistan, Lebanon and East Timor.</p>

<p>The world's most systematic human rights abusers, according to the State 
Department, continue to be those states where power remains concentrated 
in the hands of "unaccountable rulers."</p>

<p>Countries' placed in this category include North Korea, Burma, Iran, 
Zimbabwe, Cuba, China, Belarus and Eritrea.</p>

<p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, North Korea, Iran, Cuba and at times China have 
had strong ideological disagreements with the United States. North Korea 
and Iran over the past year have engaged in nuclear weapons development 
programs, against the wishes of the Bush administration and its allies.
</p>

<p>The State Department also noted that "as the worldwide push for greater 
personal and political freedom grows stronger, it is being met with 
increasing resistance from those who feel threatened by political and 
societal change."</p>

<p>This resistance has manifested itself in regulations against civil society 
groups and journalists and extrajudicial violence against journalists in 
Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Syria, Iran, 
Burundi, Rwanda, Venezuela, China and Vietnam.</p>

<p>Finally, the report does call attention to the mass killings and 
displacements in the Darfur region of Sudan and the increasing levels of 
violence in the second half of 2006 which resulted in the withdrawal of
a number of NGOs and humanitarian organisations.</p>

<p>Several years ago it was reported that writers of the Country Reports were 
instructed not to take into account any actions taken by any governments 
at Washington's request. The instruction was later withdrawn and 
accusations of such bias have not surfaced in recent years.
