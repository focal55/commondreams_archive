<p>WASHINGTON  --
Vice President Dick Cheney, lashing out at Democrats for the first time 
since the felony conviction of Lewis "Scooter" Libby, his former top deputy, 
resumed his controversial claims Monday that the war in Iraq is the central 
front in the worldwide U.S. response to the Sept. 11 attacks.

Cheney linked Iraq and al Qaeda even though post-invasion reports by the 
Senate Intelligence Committee and the presidential Commission on Intelligence 
Capabilities found no link between Saddam Hussein and al Qaeda before the 
U.S.-led invasion on March 19, 2003. 
<P>In remarks to the American-Israel Public Affairs Committee, Cheney 
contended that U.S. Marines face al Qaeda operatives in Anbar province, that 
the U.S.-Iraqi security crackdown has unmasked al Qaeda car bomb operations in 
Baghdad and that Osama bin Laden has promised to make Baghdad the capital of a 
radical Islamic empire reaching from Indonesia to Spain. 
<P>"As we get farther away from 9/11, I believe there is a temptation to 
forget the urgency of the task that came to us that day, and the comprehensive 
approach that's required to protect this country against an enemy that moves 
and acts on multiple fronts," Cheney told the annual conference of the 
pro-Israel group, which interrupted his speech at least 27 times with applause. 
<P>"Iraq's relevance to the war on terror simply could not be more plain," 
Cheney said. He said al Qaeda terrorists have made Iraq the central front in 
the U.S. war against terrorism. 
<P>The U.S. invasion, occupation and counterinsurgency campaign in Iraq over 
the past four years has claimed the lives of at least 3,193 U.S. soldiers, 
wounded 23,785 other GIs and cost taxpayers more than $400 billion. 
<P>Cheney spoke as part of the Bush administration's public relations 
offensive to win congressional support for the president's decision to send at 
least 26,100 additional U.S. combat and support troops to Iraq to try to stem 
bloodshed in Baghdad and Anbar province. 
<P>The administration also seeks congressional approval of an additional $100 
billion to finance the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. 
<P>Cheney has long contended that the U.S. invasion of Iraq four years ago 
this month was justified in part because of suspected ties between Iraqi 
dictator Saddam Hussein and al Qaeda. 
<P>But a 148-page report released by the Republican-led Senate Intelligence 
Committee in September showed that U.S. intelligence agencies disagreed with 
Bush administration claims of links between Hussein and al Qaeda. 
<P>Cheney's hard-hitting remarks represented a symbolic rejoinder to some 
critics' contention  --  and some Democrats' hopes  --  that the vice president 
might be sidelined by the federal felony conviction of Libby last week. 
<P>Libby, facing sentencing June 5, ran afoul of a special prosecutor's 
investigation into an effort by Cheney to smear a prominent anti-Iraq war 
critic who raised questions about Bush's effort to justify the Iraq invasion 
with claims that Hussein tried to buy nuclear weapons materials in Africa. 
<P>Cheney spoke six days after Libby, his former chief of staff and national 
security adviser, was convicted for obstruction and false statements. 
<P>"When members of Congress pursue an anti-war strategy that's been called 
slow bleed, they're not supporting the troops, they're undermining them," 
Cheney declared. "When members of Congress speak not of victory but of time 
limits, deadlines or other arbitrary measures, they're telling the enemy simply 
to watch the clock and wait us out."
