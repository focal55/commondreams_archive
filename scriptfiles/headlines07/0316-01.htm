<p>WASHINGTON  - Accounts of a Feb. 28 "literary luncheon" at 
the White House suggest that President George W. Bush's reading tastes --  
until now a remarkably good predictor of his policy views -- are moving 
ever rightward, even apocalyptic, despite his administration's recent 
suggestions that it is more disposed to engage Washington's foes, even in 
the Middle East.</p>

        <!--/endimage/--> The luncheon, attended as well by Vice President Dick Cheney and a dozen 
hard-line neo-conservatives, was held in honor of visiting British 
historian Andrew Roberts whose latest work, "<i>A History of the 
English-Speaking Peoples Since 1900</i>", Bush reportedly read late last year 
and subsequently sent to Prime Minister Tony Blair. Cheney took the book 
with him on his recent trip to Pakistan.</p>

<p>Roberts, an avowed Thatcherite who proudly declared himself "extremely 
right-wing" in a recent Financial Times interview, repeatedly advised the 
president, according to Irwin Stelzer, one of the neo-conservative 
attendees, to ignore rising anti-U.S. sentiment abroad and opposition at 
home in pursuing his war on terrorism -- or what the historian has called 
"the Manichean world-historical struggle" against fascism, of which 
"Totalitarian Islamic Terrorist Fascism" is only the latest.</p>

<p>A major lesson of history, Roberts told Bush, is that "will trumps 
wealth," according to Stelzer's account of the meeting in the Weekly 
Standard. He warned that "the steady drumbeat of media pessimism and 
television coverage are sapping the West's will" to fight and defeat the 
enemy which, in his view, includes Iran, as well as Sunni radicals, such 
as al Qaeda.
</p>

<p>History also warned, Roberts reportedly said, against withdrawing U.S. 
troops from Iraq according to a pre-set deadline, such as that currently 
being debated in Congress. He compared the risks of doing so to the 
slaughter of 700,000 to one million people that followed India's 
independence from British rule in 1947.</p>

<p>In his article, Stelzer, an economist at the Hudson Institute and London 
Sunday Times columnist, disclosed that Bush had also recommended that his 
staff and friends read another, even more apocalyptic, analysis of the 
current war on terror, "<i>America Alone: The End of the World As We Know 
It</i>", by Toronto-born neo-conservative columnist Mark Steyn.</p>

<p>Steyn's book, which, unlike Roberts', actually made the New York Times 
bestseller list, sees Europe's demographic trends and its multicultural, 
"post-nationalist" secularism -- of which his native Canada is also 
guilty -- as leading inevitably to the "Eupocalypse", the "recolonization 
of Europe by Islam", the emergence of "Eurabia", and the onset of a "new 
Dark Ages" in which the United States will find it difficult to survive as 
the "lonely candle of liberty."</p>

<p>Steyn, who admits that he would have to drive three hours from his home in 
thankfully "undiverse" New Hampshire to find a Muslim, sees Islam 
itself -- and not just "Islamist radicals" or "jihadis", such as al 
Qaeda -- as a unique threat that cannot be reconciled with "free 
societies".</p>

<p>"[I]t's not merely that there's a global jihad lurking within this 
religion, but that the religion itself is a political project -- and, in 
fact, an imperial project -- in a way that modern Christianity, Judaism, 
Hinduism, and Buddhism are not," he writes. "Furthermore, this particular 
religion is historically a somewhat bloodthirsty faith in which whatever's 
your bag violence-wise can almost certainly be justified."</p>

<p>To deal with the threat, he calls for a familiar recipe of favorite 
neo-conservative policies, from "support women's rights in the Muslim 
world" and "wage ideological war", to "end the Iranian regime" and "strike 
militarily when the opportunity presents itself."</p>

<p>The two books, whose worldview and policy prescriptions are remarkably 
convergent, are the latest in a series read by Bush (not otherwise known 
as a bibliophile) and lavishly promoted by neo-conservatives and their 
major media outlets. These include the Wall Street Journal's editorial 
page and various publications owned by Rupert Murdoch, Conrad Black 
(before his current legal troubles), and Canada's Asper family, all of 
which share a deep affinity for Israel's right-wing Likud Party, a strong 
belief in the moral superiority of the so-called "Anglosphere" -- Britain, 
Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the U.S. (although Steyn thinks 
Britain and Canada may already be lost to the forces of darkness) -- and 
an undeniable nostalgia for the British Empire, particularly Winston 
Churchill.</p>

<p>In the summer of 2002, for example, Bush was seen carrying a 
just-published copy of "<i>Supreme Command</i>" by neo-conservative military 
historian (and recently appointed State Department counselor) Eliot Cohen. 
The book argued that the greatest civilian wartime leaders, notably 
Abraham Lincoln and Churchill, had a far better strategic sense than their 
generals -- a particularly timely message in the months that preceded the 
Iraq war when a surprising number of recently retired military brass here 
were voicing strong reservations about the impending invasion.</p>

<p>
Two years later, Bush was given an early copy of right-wing Israeli 
politician Natan Sharansky's "<i>The Case for Democracy: The Power of Freedom 
to Overcome Tyranny and Terror</i>", which argued that peace in the Middle 
East could only emerge after the region's dictatorial regimes were 
replaced by western-style democracies. Bush was so taken with it that he 
summoned Sharansky for a White House tete-a-tete, made the book required 
reading for his senior foreign policy aides, and incorporated its ideas --  
in some cases, word for word -- into his 2005 inaugural address.</p>

<p>During the Christmas holiday later that year, Bush read Robert Kaplan's 
just-released "<i>Imperial Grunts: The American Military on the Ground</i>", an 
unapologetic paean to U.S. soldiers (who, like Bush's self-image, "hunted, 
drove pickups, employed profanities as a matter of dialect and yet had a 
literal, demonstrable belief in the Almighty") deployed across the Muslim 
world, from the southern Philippines to Mauritania, in what he called a 
contemporary planetary version of "Injun Country"; that is, those parts of 
the 19th century United States subdued and "civilized" thanks to the U.S. 
Army.</p>

<p>Like the British a century before, it was Washington's "righteous 
responsibility to advance the boundaries of free society and good 
government into zones of sheer chaos," argued Kaplan, who, like Roberts 
one year later, also warned at the time that an early U.S. withdrawal from 
Iraq would result in a "real bloodbath".</p>

<p>What is remarkable about all of these books is -- much like the 
cherry-picked and manipulated intelligence stovepiped to Bush in the 
run-up to the Iraq War -- both their extraordinary ideological narrowness 
and their utility in the pursuit of a neo-conservative agenda, especially 
in the Middle East.</p>

<p>In one way or another, each affirms core neo-conservative ideas: the 
essential beneficence of U.S. (and Anglospheric) power even if the 
"natives" are ungrateful; the supreme importance of both "will" and 
military might in wielding that power, particularly against enemies that 
can never be "appeased" or "contained" and that, in Roberts' words, are 
motivated not so much by legitimate grievances against U.S. policies, as 
by "loathing of the English-speaking people's traditions of democratic 
pluralism"; the evils of "liberalism", "secularism" and "moral relativism" 
of western societies that undermine their will to fight; and the 
catastrophic consequences of retreat or defeat.</p>

<p>All of these also play to Bush's own Manicheanism and self-image as a 
courageous, often lonely, leader in the mold of a Lincoln or Churchill, 
determined to pursue what he believes is right regardless of what "old 
Europe", "intellectuals", "elites", or even the electorate thinks about 
his course and confident only in the conviction that History or God will 
vindicate him.</p>

<p>It's an image that Bush's neo-conservative guests -- including the Wall 
Street Journal's editorial page editor, Paul Gigot; former Commentary 
editor Norman Podhoretz, New York Sun editor Seth Lipsky, and several 
like-minded columnists -- themselves have also tried hard to propagate, 
particularly as public confidence in Bush has fallen to the longest 
sustained lows for any president in more than 50 years.</p>

<p>"It is fair to say that the few people I spoke with as we left shared my 
impression," wrote the Standard's Stelzer. "Here is a man comfortable in 
his own skin; whose religious faith guides him in his search for the 
good... who worries less about his 'legacy' than about his standing with 
the Almighty, (and) who is quite well read..."
