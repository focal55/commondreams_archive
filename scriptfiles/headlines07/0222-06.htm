<p> The World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF)'s climate 
coordinator in the South Pacific says that a recent United Nations report 
on climate change has "underestimated" the threat to millions of people in 
the region from sea-level rise. <br>
<br>
While the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report 
provides a  detailed picture of how humans activity is changing earth's 
climate by burning fossil fuels, it fails to adequately identify the real 
risks of sea level rise, something particularly relevant to the Pacific, 
WWF coordinator Ashvini Fernando told IPS in an interview.
<br>
<br>
She said that that the danger was graver than outlined in the U.N. report, 
and that by underestimating it, the report puts at risk millions of people 
who live on low-lying coasts not just in the Pacific, but also around the 
world.
<br>
<br>
"Research using scientific models different to that of the IPCC have 
predicted much larger increases in sea level, exceeding one metre over the 
next century," said Fernando, who is regional climate change coordinator 
for the WWF’s South Pacific programme.  "This would have dire implications 
for the Pacific as this region has many atolls and low-lying coastal areas 
(which) are only several meters above sea level."
<br>
<br>

Fernando said that even on high islands, much of the population lives 
along the coast which is typically low-lying so sea-level rise, especially 
by as much as, or more than one metre, would be disastrous for the region.
<br>
<br>
The IPCC report, released earlier this month in Paris, blamed human 
activities for global warming.  It said in its grimmest warning ever that 
rising temperatures could cause more droughts, heat waves and rising seas 
for 10,000 years even if emissions of greenhouse gases are capped.
<br>
<br>
It predicted a three-degree Celsius temperature rise, which it said was "conservative". The real rise could be double that figure, resulting in 
‘truly catastrophic’ conditions for all life on earth. <br>
<br>
Experts say that the tiny Pacific Island nations, which collectively 
account for a mere 0.0012 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions, are 
the most vulnerable and would be the first to feel the full brunt of 
global warming.
<br>
<br>
Among those most at risk are some of the world's lowest-lying islands, 
such as Kiribati, Vanuatu, the Marshall Islands, Tuvalu, and parts of 
Papua New Guinea.
<br>
<br>
In Vanuatu, an entire coastal village on the island of Tegua is being 
forced to move to higher ground, its huts flooded by surging seas while 
Kiribati, with a population of 92,000 people, is also having to take 
drastic action.
<br>
<br>
Reacting to the U.N. report, Kiribati President Anote Tong, told the media 
that world efforts to stem global warming were welcome but may be too 
late. He said that his nation was already suffering, with land and houses 
washed away and even some public buildings threatened.
<br>
<br>
Fernando said that the U.N. report vindicated long-standing calls by 
Pacific Island governments and civil society groups such as the WWF for a 
meaningful global agreement on combating climate change.
<br>
<br>
"The Fourth Assessment Report only goes to highlight why such an agreement 
is necessary and urgent. We continue to push for and hope that developed 
and industrialised countries will heed the report and make the necessary 
changes and emissions cuts that will ensure dangerous climate change does 
not happen."

<br>
<br>
On whether the new measures announced by the United States (which alone 
contributes to about 25 percent of climate changing gas emissions) and 
Australia to cut back on emissions went far enough, She said proposed 
measures outlined in the President George W. Bush’s State of the Union 
Address were inadequate. <br>
<br>
The most effective response, she said, would be for all governments to 
agree to a global solution advocating rapid expansion of renewable energy 
and energy efficiency technologies.
<br>
<br>
"If the U.S. and Australia were serious about tackling climate change, 
they would join the Kyoto Protocol -- a globally accepted means by which 
to begin combating climate change," she said. "WWF hopes that the global 
community will take on the challenge of climate change both now and in the 
future making the deep cuts in emissions that are necessary to combat this 
global problem."
<br>
<br>
Because the Pacific Islands are small and un-influential and their 
concerns easily  ignored, their governments have been actively engaged in 
international climate change negotiations for over a decade through the 
Alliance of Small Islands States or AOSIS, a negotiating bloc at climate 
change negotiations.
<br>
<br>
She said that given the consequences of climate change, Pacific Island 
countries need to engage even more effectively in international climate 
policy negotiations to produce a global agreement based on the Kyoto 
Protocol to keep climate change well below the 2 degree Celsius 
temperature rise over pre-industrial levels.
<br>
<br>
"This report is a reminder that we have to act and act now. This year is 
the last chance for governments worldwide to set meaningful targets to 
curb emissions of climate changing gases at the 13th U.N. Climate Change 
Conference in December, in Indonesia,’’ Fernando said.
