<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --> <p> Iraqi journalists are outraged over yet another 
U.S. military raid on the media.
<br>
<b><br>
</b>U.S. soldiers raided and ransacked the offices of the Iraq Syndicate of 
Journalists (ISJ) in central Baghdad Tuesday this week. Ten armed guards 
were arrested, and 10 computers and 15 small electricity generators kept 
for donation to families of killed journalists were seized.
<br>
<br>
This is not the first time U.S. troops have attacked the media in Iraq, 
but this time the raid was against the very symbol of it. Many Iraqis 
believe the U.S. soldiers did all they could to deliver the message of 
their leadership to Iraqi journalists to keep their mouth shut about 
anything going wrong with the U.S.-led occupation.
<br>
<br>
"The Americans have delivered so many messages to us, but we simply 
refused all of them," Youssif al-Tamimi of the ISJ in Baghdad told IPS. 
"They killed our colleagues, closed so many newspapers, arrested hundreds 
of us and now they are shooting at our hearts by raiding our headquarters. 
This is the freedom of speech we received."

<br>
<br>
Some Iraqi journalists blame the Iraqi government.
<br>
<br>
"Four years of occupation, and those Americans still commit such foolish 
mistakes by following the advice of their Iraqi collaborators," Ahmad 
Hassan, a freelance journalist from Basra visiting Baghdad told IPS. "They 
(the U.S. military) have not learned yet that Iraqi journalists will raise 
their voice against such acts and will keep their promise to their people 
to search for the truth and deliver it to them at any cost."
<br>
<br>
There is a growing belief in Iraq that U.S. allies in the current Iraqi 
government are leading the U.S. military to raid places and people who do 
not follow Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki's directions.
<br>
<br>
"It is our Iraqi colleagues who pushed the Americans to that hole," Fadhil 
Abbas, an Iraqi television producer told IPS. "Some journalists who failed 
to fake the truth here are trying hard to silence truth seekers by 
providing false information to the U.S. military in order to take 
advantage of their stupidity in handling the whole Iraqi issue."
<br>
<br>
The incident occurred just two days after the Iraqi Union covering 
journalists received formal recognition from the government. The new 
status allowed the Syndicate access to its previously blocked bank 
account, and it had just purchased new computers and satellite equipment.
<br>
<br>
"Just at the point when the Syndicate achieves formal recognition for its 
work as an independent body of professionals, the American military 
carries out a brutal and unprovoked assault," International Federation of 
Journalists General Secretary Aidan White said in a statement. "Anyone 
working for media that does not endorse U.S. policy and actions could now 
be at risk."
<br>
<br>
The raid was a "shocking violation of journalists' rights," White said. 
"In the past three years more than 120 Iraqi journalists, many of them 
Syndicate members, have been killed, and now their union has been turned 
over in an unprovoked act of intimidation."
<br>
<br>
"The Americans and their Iraqi government followers are destroying social 
activities and civil unions so that no group can oppose their crimes and 
plans," 55-year-old lawyer Hashim Jawad of the Iraqi Lawyers Union in 
Baghdad told IPS. "The press is our remaining lung to breathe democracy in 
this country and now it is being targeted."
<br>
<br>

The Press Emblem Campaign (PEC), an independent humanitarian association 
based in Geneva which seeks to strengthen legal protection and safety of 
journalists around the world also strongly condemned the U.S. military 
raid.
<br>
<br>
The media watchdog group Reporters Without Borders lists at least 148 
journalists and media workers killed in Iraq since the beginning of the 
U.S.-led invasion in March 2003.
<br>
<br>
The group also compiles an annual Press Freedom Index for countries around 
the world. In 2002, under Saddam Hussein's rule, Iraq ranked 130. In the 
2006 index, Iraq fell to position 154.
<br>
<br>
The same index listed the U.S. at 17 in 2002, a rank that fell to 56 by 
2006.
<br>
<br>
The Brussels Tribunal, a group of "intellectuals, artists and activists 
who denounce the...war," lists the names, dates and circumstances in which 
191 media professionals of Iraqi nationality have been killed. <br>
<br>
The PEC and the other watchdogs have requested the Iraqi government to 
launch an immediate inquiry into the attack.
<br>
<br>
"I only wish the U.S. administration and our government would stop lying 
about freedom in Iraq," Mansoor Salim, a retired journalist, told IPS. 
"How stupid we were to have believed their statements about freedom. I 
admit that I was one of the fools."
