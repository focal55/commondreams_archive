<p>Television journalist Bill Moyers slammed President Bush on Tuesday for "mind-boggling" contempt for proof of global warming and blamed what he called Bush's dependence on conservative Christians and multinational corporations.</P>
<P>"Without the Christian right, the corporations that now control Washington would not have had the votes to eviscerate our environmental protections," Moyers said in a Chrysler Hall speech hosted by The Norfolk Forum.</P>

Moyers, known for investigative reporting as well as his programs on spirituality, said conservative Christians' literal belief in the Bible has made them dismissive of scientific evidence of the danger of global warming.</P>
<P>He also said Bush was "beholden to his corporate patrons and campaign contributors" and that corporations control the nation's environmental policy "lock, stock and barrel." </P>
<P> Moyers, 72, called the environment one of the toughest topics he reported on.</P>
<P>Religion is equally challenging because of the country's growing spiritual diversity, he said.</P>
<P>"We have to ask, Can we avoid the intolerance, the chauvinism, the fanaticism, the bitter fruits that spring up when different religions are next-door neighbors?"</P>
<P>Moyers said his wide-ranging interviews on subjects such as the book of Genesis showed him that each religion "offers a profound insight into human nature."</P>
<P>"They have led me away from condescending toleration of other faiths to an anticipation and affirmation of positive engagement with them," said Moyers, who called himself both a journalist and a spiritual "pilgrim."</P>
<P>Earlier in the evening, Moyers said he plans to launch a new weekly program on public television in April.</P>

<P>He said the show, "Bill Moyers' Journal," would be "an eclectic program of what I think is interesting and important that week." </P>
