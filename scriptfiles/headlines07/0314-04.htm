<p>The Bush administration wants to
eliminate federal support for geothermal power just as many
U.S. states are looking to cut greenhouse gas emissions and
raise renewable power output.</p>

The move has angered scientists who say there is enough hot
water underground to meet all U.S. electricity needs without
greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
<p>&quot;The Department of Energy has not requested funds for
geothermal research in our fiscal-year 2008 budget,&quot; said
Christina Kielich, a spokeswoman for the Department of Energy.
&quot;Geothermal is a mature technology. Our focus is on
breakthrough energy research and development.&quot;</p>
<p>The administration of George W. Bush has made renewable
energy a priority as it seeks to wean the United States off
foreign oil, but it emphasizes use of biofuels like ethanol and
biodiesel for vehicles and nuclear research for electricity.</p>
<p>&quot;In spite of its enormous potential, the geothermal option
for the United States has been largely ignored,&quot; a recent study
led by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology said.</p>
<p>Last year, the DOE requested no funding for geothermal for
the 2007 fiscal year, after funding averaged about &#36;26 million
over the previous six years, but Congress restored &#36;5 million.
This year, the DOE&#39;s &#36;24.3 billion budget request includes a 38
percent federal spending increase for nuclear power, but
nothing for geothermal.</p>

<p>Advocates say they hope Congress can restore at least &#36;25
million in funding to keep geothermal research on track.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s too early to pick our resources. We need them all,&quot;
said Karl Gawell, executive director of the Geothermal Energy
Association.</p>
<p>New geothermal power projects by 2050 could provide 100,000
megawatts of electricity -- enough to power about 80 million
U.S. homes, or as much as U.S. nuclear power plants make today,
the MIT study said.</p>
<p>But U.S. geothermal development will need &#36;300 million to
&#36;400 million over 15 years to make this type of power
competitive versus other forms of power generation, the study
said.</p>
<p>The big hurdle for geothermal power is finding out where
the hot water is and developing better ways to drill for it.
Geothermal power plants use steam or water from underground to
turn turbines to create electricity.</p>
<p>Recreational hot springs across the United States are
examples of where geothermal is easy to access. To be a viable
power generator, hot water a mile or more underground has to be
developed, said Gawell of the Geothermal Energy Association.</p>

<p>Leland &quot;Roy&quot; Mink, who until last October was geothermal
program director at the DOE, said he thinks the White House&#39;s
waning interest in geothermal is a mistake. He said he left the
DOE when he saw the Department was cutting funding.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s far from a mature technology,&quot; said Mink, who is now
working on a  project in Idaho. &quot;There&#39;s a lot to do.
For starters, we need to develop drill bits that last longer.
It&#39;s a hostile environment down there.&quot;</p>
<p>While its industry is largely undeveloped, the United
States is still the largest producer of geothermal electricity
in the world. U.S. geothermal power generation in 2005 was 0.36
percent of national power generation and geothermal capacity is
rated at 2,828 megawatts, with almost all in California,
according to the Geothermal Energy Association.</p>
