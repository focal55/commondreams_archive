UNITED NATIONS - The U.S.-led war on terror has triggered a 
strong backlash against some of the world's minorities, including ethnic 
and religious groups, according to a study released here Tuesday.

"The debate continues to rage about whether the 'war on terror' has made 
the world a safer place for the West," noted Mark Lattimer, director of 
the London-based <a href="http://www.minorityrights.org/" target="_new">Minority Rights Group (MRG) International</a>. "But it has 
certainly made it a much more dangerous place for minorities."
<br>
<br>
Titled the "State of the World's Minorities", the 2007 edition of the 
annual study points out that some of the countries where minorities 
continue to be repressed include key allies of the United States in its 
war on terror, including Pakistan, Turkey and Israel.
<br><br>
"U.S. allies have managed to barter their support for the war on terror in 
return for having their human rights record ignored," Lattimer said.

<br><br>
Somalia is "the world's most dangerous country for minority communities" 
and has overtaken Iraq to top a global ranking of countries where 
minorities are most under threat, according to the annual survey. Sudan 
has been ranked third.
<br><br>
African states make up more than half of the top 20 list. Among the 
African countries where minorities are under attack are Sudan, Nigeria, 
Angola, Burundi and Rwanda.
<br><br>
Asked why the problem is so acute in Africa compared to other parts of the 
world, Lattimer told IPS: "Africa has long suffered from high rates of 
civil conflict, and this affects minorities disproportionately."
<br><br>
In part, he argued, "this is a legacy of colonial times, but in some 
states, government and opposition politicians continue to use ethnicity as 
a mobilising factor, often with disastrous consequences, as we have seen 
before in Rwanda and see now in Darfur."
<br><br>
In other states, most notably in the Democratic Republic of Congo, ethnic 
militias have been used by other countries as proxies to gain illegal 
control of valuable mineral resources, he added.
<br><br>
In Asia, Sri Lanka has taken a major leap in rank, jumping 47 places since 
the previous year, and is now in the top 20 list.
<br><br>
This has been attributed to the resumption of heavy fighting primarily in 
eastern Sri Lanka. The origins of the war go back to a decades-long ethnic 
conflict.
<br><br>
The report says that minority Tamils and Muslims are not only caught in 
the crossfire between government forces and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil 
Eelam rebel group, but are also specifically targeted for human rights 
abuses, including abductions and disappearances because of their minority 
status.
<br><br>

Other Asian countries where minorities are under threat include 
Afghanistan, Pakistan, Burma (Myanmar) and Thailand.
<br><br>
In Pakistan, the minority communities under repression include Ahmadis, 
Hindus, Baluchis, Mohhajirs, Pashtuns and Sindhis, according to the 
report.
<br><br>
Pakistan's cooperation in the war on terror has resulted in virtual 
impunity against the human rights violations committed against minorities, 
it adds.
<br><br>
The MRG list also includes the Democratic Republic of Congo, Angola, the 
Russian Federation, Haiti, Iran, Yemen, Lebanon, and Guinea.
<br><br>
According to the study, negative fallout from the ongoing war on terror 
also includes the rise in Islamaphobia in the 27-member European Union 
(EU), including Britain, which has affected millions of ethnic Arab and 
South Asian and other Muslim minorities.
<br><br>
Mouin Rabbani, a contributing editor to the Washington-based Middle East 
Report, said: "I think the observation that the United States has given 
key allies a free ride on their human rights records in exchange for their 
support since the 9/11 attacks (on U.S. landmarks in 2001) is only 
partially correct."
<br><br>
This is not because there has been serious scrutiny, but rather because 
states that were also allies before that time were already exempt from all 
but the most cursory forms of scrutiny, except in cases were effective 
domestic political pressure dictated otherwise.
<br><br>
"The observation that scrutiny has been reduced I think only applies to 
states whose relationship with the United States changed in the aftermath 
of 9/11," Rabbani told IPS.
<br><br>
Pakistan, for example, had in recent years lost some favour as the key 
U.S. ally in South Asia, and there were strains in the relationship 
between Washington and the regime of President Pervez Musharraf.

<br><br>
All that changed as Pakistan emerged as a key ally after the invasion of 
Afghanistan, with a commensurate elimination of questions about the 
legitimacy of the Musharraf military regime and its practices within 
Pakistan, he added.
<br><br>
In the case of Israel, for example, "I don't think there has been an 
appreciable difference since 9/11," Rabbani added.
<br><br>
He believes there was perhaps more support as Israel's enemies 
increasingly became identified as Washington's own, but says this is a 
question of degree not direction.
<br><br>
"I think the observation that there has been a dramatic rise in 
Islamophobia in Europe since September 2001 is entirely correct. While the 
phenomenon was not absent before then, the available empirical evidence 
certainly sustains this conclusion," he added.
<br><br>
Asked what the United Nations or the international community could do to 
mitigate the problems of minorities, Lattimer told IPS: "The 'war on 
terror' has made the world a more dangerous place for minorities because 
governments have both stigmatised whole communities as 'terrorist' and 
targeted the civilian population accordingly, or because they have pledged 
their support for the 'war on terror' in order to persuade the United 
States to turn a blind eye to their ongoing repression of minorities."
<br><br>
The United Nations and the international community thus has a particular 
duty to state unequivocally that collective punishments, racial profiling 
and other targeting or punishment of communities on the basis of their 
religion or ethnicity is completely unacceptable, he noted.
<br><br>
'The international community should no longer continue to allow atrocities 
against civilians to be excused as actions against 'terrorist 
sympathisers' or as collateral damage," Lattimer added.
