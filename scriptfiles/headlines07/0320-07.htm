<p>Nina Fernandez, her younger sister, Mia, and their friend Emma Dayney got their homework done right after school Monday and headed to the state Capitol to perform what they believe is their civic duty.

<p>"We are the new generation (of war protesters)!" Mia Fernandez, 11, said.

<p>From the classroom to the Capitol, the youngsters joined about 300 other demonstrators to continue the weekend of protests across the country that marked the fourth anniversary of the U.S. invasion of Iraq. Monday's event was organized by MoveOn.org, a nonprofit group with liberal leanings.

<p>The group had hoped to ring the Capitol but managed to make it only halfway. They were gratified, however, with the response of passing motorists who honked in support of their message to bring U.S. troops back home from Iraq.

<p>They held candles and waved U.S. flags in memory of the more than 3,000 American troops who have died and the thousands of Iraqis who have been killed by battling forces, terrorism and sectarian violence.

<p>Protesters held a large banner at East Colfax Avenue and Broadway reading: "Bush lied; 1,000s died."

<p>"All these things that are happening with our government, all these choices our government is making - I'm unhappy with," said Nina Fernandez, 14, who was joined by her father, Bryant, and uncle, Bruce.

<p>What is Nina unhappy with?

<p>"Just the fact of war, basically," she said.

<p>Emma Dayney, 14, said she was not influenced by adults to participate in the demonstration. She and her classmates have talked about the war at school.

<p>"At my age, you start developing opinions," Emma said. "It's worth it for me to support the troops. A lot of lives have been lost. During the Holocaust a lot of people didn't stand up to what was going on against the Jewish people."

<p>Jim Broderick-King, 38, stood along Broadway with his 4-year- old daughter, Amelia, astride his neck and the two flashed peace signs at passing motorists.

<p>"It's her third protest," Broderick-King said of his daughter's activism. "This war is about money, business and politics, and more lives are being lost for those reasons," he said.

<p>Robert Fiorino carried a sign that read "Impeach the Liar- in-Chief," and his 7-year-old son Jack waved a peace sign.

<p>For Fiorino's son it's part of his education. Next week, he will visit Washington, D.C., with his mother to view the Declaration of Independence.

<p>"It's absolutely essential we hold this administration accountable," Fiorino said. "This war is an absolute tragedy. It's one of the many crimes of this regime."
