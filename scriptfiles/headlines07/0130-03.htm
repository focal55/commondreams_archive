Big business have donated &#163;120m to support the campaign while MySpace will push the message out to its millions of subscribers.
<P>Celebrities including actor Josh Hartnett and singer KT Tunstall helped launch the initiative in London.
</P>
<P>Josh said: &#147;I grew up in Minnesota which is usually a cold place, but we&#146;ve seen abnormally warm winters the last couple of years, which is unnerving.</P>
<P>&#147;If water levels continue to rise at this rate, my house in New York will be underwater, and I&#146;ll have to get a gondola to get around. It&#146;s frightening. </P>
<P>&#147;I&#146;m not on a mission or anything like that, that would be ridiculous, I just want to tell people why I&#146;m concerned about climate change and if they want to make a change in their own lives that&#146;s great.&#148;</P>
<P>KT Tunstall said growing up in Scotland and seeing the effect of climate change to the coastline there spurred her into action.</P>
<P>She said: &#147;It&#146;s becoming quite apparent to all musicians how much more impact they can have. We&#146;re always in big rooms full of people, and the word about what you can do isn&#146;t out yet.</P>

<P>&#147;Things like not leaving your phone charger in the wall are so simple.&#148;</P>
<P>Dan Morrell, Founder of Global Cool said: &#147;Over the next 10 years Global Cool will give everyone the tools and knowledge to actively decrease their own CO2 emissions and show them how to encourage others to do the same. </P>
<P>"Together we can actively create a global movement committed to pushing back the climatic tipping point, delivering a sustained long term, benign future without the worst effects of climate change.&#148;</P>
<P>Tomorrow Global Cool founders will meet the Prime Minister at Downing Street and 50 of the world&#146;s top business leaders to push their cause.</P>
