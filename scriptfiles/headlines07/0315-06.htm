<p>WASHINGTON  - Climate change is of real concern in all parts 
of the world, but there is disagreement over whether the problem is urgent 
enough to require immediate, costly measures or whether more modest 
efforts will be satisfactory, according to an international poll released 
Wednesday.</p>

<p>The poll, conducted by the Chicago Council on Global Affairs and 
<a href="http://www.WorldPublicOpinion.org" target="_new">WorldPublicOpinion.org</a> in cooperation with polling organizations around 
the world, was carried out in 17 countries containing more than 55 percent 
of the world population, although not all questions were asked in all 
countries.</p>

<p>Twelve countries were asked whether steps should be taken to address 
climate change.</p>

<p>Ninety-two-percent of Australians favor measures to combat global 
warming, making it the country with the largest majority of its population 
believing immediate action should be taken to reverse climate change.</p>

<p>
Surprisingly, China, whose environmental policies are often criticized, 
and Israel are the next most inclined to favor such measures, with 83 
percent of their populations in favor of immediate actions to reverse 
trends in global warming.</p>

<p>The lowest level of support for taking steps to address global warming was 
found in India, with 49 percent of the population supporting immediate 
action while 24 percent were opposed.</p>

<p>Arguments against the validity of global warming as a scientific fact have 
not fared well, with fewer than one in four people in any country 
endorsing the statement, "Until we are sure that global warming is really 
a problem, we should not take any steps that would have economic costs."</p>

<p>Countries with the highest percentages favoring inaction include India 
(24 percent), Russia (22 percent), and Armenia (19 percent).</p>

<p>Countries with the smallest percentages favoring inaction include 
Argentina (three percent) and Thailand (seven percent).</p>

<p>In a separate question, asked in 10 countries, strong majorities in all of 
the countries say climate change is an important threat, with small 
minorities calling it unimportant.</p>

<p>The highest percentage of climate change sceptics are in Armenia (16 
percent) and Israel (15 percent).</p>

<p>Majorities call climate change a "critical" issue in Mexico (70 percent), 
Australia (69 percent), South Korea (67 percent), Iran (61 percent), 
Israel (52 percent) and India (51 percent).</p>

<p>Larger numbers agree climate change is "critical" in Armenia (47 percent), 
China (47 percent), and the United States (46 percent) while Ukraine was 
the only country split about whether the problem was "critical" (33 
percent) or "important but not critical" (33 percent).
</p>

<p>In five of 12 countries polled, the most common view is "Global warming is 
a serious and pressing problem. We should begin taking steps now even if 
this involves significant costs." These include: Australia (69 percent), 
Argentina (63 percent), Israel (54 percent), the United States (43 
percent), and Armenia (37 percent).</p>

<p>The most commonly held view in another five countries is that, "The 
problem of global warming should be addressed, but its effects will be 
gradual, so we can deal with the problem gradually by taking steps that 
are low in cost."</p>

<p>Proponents of the "go-slow" and "low-cost" approach include: Philippines 
(49 percent), Thailand (41 percent), Poland (39 percent), Ukraine (37 
percent), and India (30 percent).</p>

<p>The polls are split between those who favor less expensive measures and 
those who believe the problem merits action involving significant cost in 
China (low cost, 41 percent, significant cost 42 percent), and Russia (low 
cost, 34 percent, and significant cost, 32 percent).</p>

<p>The poll attempted to address the issues of an equitable approach to 
climate change by asking sample groups in five developing countries --  
China, India, Argentina, Armenia and Thailand -- "If the developed 
countries are willing to provide substantial aid, do you think the 
less-developed countries should make a commitment to limit their 
greenhouse gas emissions?"</p>

<p>In all five counties majorities say they should but most significant 
responses were observed in China (a 79 percent majority), and in India (48 
percent agree, 29 percent disagree).</p>

<p>All five of these countries have ratified or accepted the Kyoto Protocol 
to curb greenhouse gas emissions, but are not defined as industrialised 
countries under the treaty.</p>

<p>Their developing country status under Kyoto means they are not legally 
obliged to cut emissions of carbon dioxide or other pollutants but could 
be eligible for various schemes and funds that pay developing countries to 
reduce carbon emissions.
Just last month, a report released by the United Nations called attention 
to the rising flow of greenhouse gasses released by the economic 
powerhouses of India and China.</p>

<p>
By 2009, says the International Energy Agency, China will have overtaken 
the U.S. as the largest emitter of greenhouse gasses that are 
energy-related.</p>

<p>Three developed countries were asked the same question about providing aid 
to less-developed countries to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. 
Respondents in all three showed high levels of support for such 
programs, with 64 percent of U.S. citizens, 84 percent of Poles, and 72 
percent of Ukrainians.</p>

<p>All three countries are considered industrialised countries under the 
Kyoto accord, but the U.S. has refused to the ratify it, arguing that it 
would be too costly to the U.S. economy and that large developing 
countries like China and India are unfairly exempted.</p>

<p>The following countries were included in the poll -- China, India, the 
United States, Indonesia, Russia, Thailand, Ukraine, Poland, Iran, Mexico, 
South Korea, the Philippines, Australia, Argentina, Peru, Israel, Armenia 
and the Palestinian territories.</p>

<p>An additional poll released today by the Yale University School of 
Forestry and Environmental Studies reinforced the Chicago Council on 
Global Affairs poll, finding that 83 percent of U.S. citizens now say 
global warming is a "serious" problem, up from 70 percent in 2004.</p>

<p>The recent poll data suggesting an increased awareness that global warming 
requires immediate action comes on the heels of a report released last 
month by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change -- the leading 
international network of climate scientists -- which confirmed the 
scientific evidence behind global warming and urged prompt action to slow 
and reverse the dangerous buildup of heat-trapping gasses in the 
atmosphere.</p>
