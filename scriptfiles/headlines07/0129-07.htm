<p>Thirteen percent of Americans have never heard of global warming even though their country is the world's top source of greenhouse gases, a 46-country survey showed on Monday.</p><p>The report, by ACNielsen of more than 25,000 Internet users, showed that 57 percent of people around the world considered global warming a "very serious problem" and a further 34 percent rated it a "serious problem."</p><p>"It has taken extreme and life-threatening weather patterns to finally drive the message home that global warming is happening and is here to stay unless a concerted, global effort is made to reverse it," said Patrick Dodd, the President of ACNielsen Europe.</p><p>People in Latin America were most worried while U.S. citizens were least concerned with just 42 percent rating global warming "very serious."</p><p>The United States emits about a quarter of all greenhouse gases, the biggest emitter ahead of China, Russia and India.</p><p>Thirteen percent of U.S. citizens said they had never heard or read anything about global warming, the survey said.</p><p>Almost all climate scientists say that temperatures are creeping higher because of heat-trapping greenhouse gases released by burning fossil fuels.</p><p>The study also found that 91 percent of people had heard about global warming and 50 percent reckoned it was caused by human activities.</p><p>A U.N. report due on Friday is set to say it is at least 90 percent probable that human activities are the main cause of warming in the past 50 years.</p><p>People in China and Brazil were most convinced of the link to human activities and Americans least convinced.</p><p>The survey said that people living in regions vulnerable to natural disasters seemed most concerned -- ranging from Latin Americans worried by damage to coffee or banana crops to people in the Czech Republic whose country was hit by 2002 floods.</p><p>In Latin America, 96 percent of respondents said they had heard of global warming and 75 percent rated it "very serious."</p><p>Most industrial nations have signed up for the U.N.'s Kyoto Protocol, which imposed caps on emissions of greenhouse gases, mainly from factories, power plants and vehicles.</p>
<p>President George W. Bush pulled the United States out of Kyoto in 2001, but said last week that climate change was a "serious challenge."</p>
