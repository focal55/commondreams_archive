<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><P>The case for adding troops in Iraq  --  and keeping them there  --  rests 
on one basic assumption: As bad as things are now, they would become 
catastrophic if the United States leaves. 
<P>President Bush in his State of the Union address Tuesday warned that an 
early U.S. exit would create "a nightmare scenario" for America.  
<P>In his Jan. 10 address explaining his order of 21,500 more U.S. troops to 
Iraq, Bush said a retreat would "force a collapse of the Iraqi government, tear 
that country apart, and result in mass killings on an unimaginable scale. Such 
a scenario would result in our troops being forced to stay in Iraq even longer, 
and confront an enemy that is even more lethal." 
<P>Not everyone is convinced. Some analysts say the apocalyptic scenarios of 
U.S. withdrawal mirror arguments the administration and many others made for 
the U.S. invasion in 2003. The premise of the invasion  --  flawed as it turned 
out  --  was that former Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass 
destruction, posing a direct threat to the United States and the world. 
<P>"It's remarkable how little time people have spent examining the 
assumptions," said Kurt Campbell, a former national security official in the 
Clinton administration, now at the Center for Strategic and International 
Studies.  
<P>But the administration is not alone. The bipartisan Iraq Study Group, 
headed by former Secretary of State James Baker, a Republican, and former 
Indiana Rep. Lee Hamilton, a Democrat, laid out a "Pandora's box" of dire 
scenarios of U.S. failure in Iraq: 
<P>Sectarian war in Iraq spreads across the Middle East. Neighboring regimes 
are destabilized, and populations radicalized. A humanitarian catastrophe of 
refugees and ethnic cleansing follows. Iranian influence rises. Regional war 
erupts. Oil supplies are disrupted. Al Qaeda claims victory, gains recruits and 
money and is emboldened to strike again. American credibility is damaged. 
<P>"If we get run off, there's no reason to say it would be a positive thing, 
OK?" said retired Gen. William Nash, U.S. commander in Bosnia from 1995 to 
1997. "But just think of the dire predictions that were made in 1975 when the 
helicopters were leaving the embassy grounds of Saigon and everybody thinking 
that the dominoes would begin to fall. Lo and behold, the dominoes not only 
didn't fall, but a number of the regional actors started taking some 
responsibilities for some things." 

<P>Bush said  Tuesday night that if the United States withdraws, the result 
will be an "epic battle" between Sunni and Shiite extremists and the creation 
of a haven for oil-fueled al Qaeda terrorists. Out of the chaos, Bush said, 
"would emerge an emboldened enemy with new safe havens, new recruits, new 
resources and an even greater determination to harm America. To allow this to 
happen would be to ignore the lessons of Sept. 11 and invite tragedy." 
<P>Terrible things cannot be ruled out, said Michael Mandelbaum, head of the 
foreign policy program at Johns Hopkins University's School for Advanced 
International Studies. "But the relevant question for American foreign policy 
is, would they be terrible for us? Would we be worse off than we are now? And I 
don't think that goes without saying." 
<P>Many of the dark scenarios sketched as future prospects already exist, 
even critics of a withdrawal readily acknowledge. 
<P>Refugee flows are large and growing  --  nearly 4 million Iraqis have 
either been internally displaced or have fled abroad. Ethnic cleansing is 
altering the makeup of Baghdad. A civil war is underway. Populations have 
become radicalized. Al Qaeda terrorists have established a base in Anbar 
province. Iran is intervening, aiding Shiite militias. Syria is allowing 
militants over its border. American standing is damaged. 
<P>But there is no reason to automatically assume, many experts said, that 
the situation will improve if U.S. troops stay  --  or get worse if they leave. 
<P>"When you go through the analysis  --  even though I am prepared to 
concede that there can be dark scenarios coming out of a withdrawal from Iraq  
--  it's not at all clear to me that they are any worse than staying," said 
Rand Beers, a former national security official through the last four 
administrations, including the current Bush administration. 
<P>Regional war is the scariest of the scenarios, with the assumption that it 
would be accompanied by an oil shock.  
<P>That assumes all the neighboring countries would look into the abyss, and 
jump in. Yet it is not clear why they would do so. 
<P>"When you sit down and scrub that carefully, it's not a certainty by any 
means," said Bruce Riedel, a former Bush national security official now at the 
Brookings Institution's Saban Center for Middle East Policy. 
<P>Take Iran. "Iran has very close ties to every single Shia and Kurdish 
politician, militia and political group in Iraq," Riedel said. "They're already 
in there. They have a huge intelligence presence inside of Iraq. It's hard for 
me to see why, after we left, they would need to put in ground troops. They've 
already got their influence there, and their side of the civil war, the Shia, 
is likely to prevail in the long run." 
<P>What about the Sunni Arab states, especially U.S. ally Saudi Arabia? Saudi 
officials have warned loudly that they would come to the aid of Iraq's minority 
Sunnis if they were threatened with annihilation. 
<P>"The reality is that none of them have the military capability to do 
anything serious," Riedel said. "Saudi Arabia doesn't have an army that can 
advance into Anbar province. It just doesn't have that military capability, nor 
does Jordan, nor does Kuwait. These are countries that can barely defend 
themselves, let alone project military power." 
<P>They can provide arms, money and volunteers, he said, but Sunni insurgents 
already have ample supplies of those. 
<P>That leaves the Turks. Turkey is seen as the state most likely to enter 
Iraq if it breaks up and a new, independent Kurdistan emerges. Turkey has for 
decades been battling a Kurdish resistance in its eastern provinces that border 
Iraq. 
<P>Turkey also wants to join the European Union. Kurdish northern Iraq also 
is a notoriously difficult area to control. 
<P>"If the United States is insistent, I think Turkey would stand back," said 
Edward Walker, former U.S. ambassador to Israel, Egypt and the United Arab 
Emirates. "I don't think the Turks are interested in breaking their links to 
the U.S. or to Europeans just to get themselves into the middle of a civil 
war." 
<P>Riedel agreed. "I think when Turkey looks hard at this problem, it's very 
unlikely that what the Turkish military is going to want to do is occupy a very 
difficult-to-control area and just expand the number of Kurds that are shooting 
at Turkish soldiers," he said. "I don't dismiss it. There is a risk of regional 
conflict. But I think that a skillful policy of containment and diplomatic 
action could minimize it after we go, and it does not become a rationale for 
young American men and women to give down their lives indefinitely." 

<P>In fact, it is not all that easy to see exactly how an Iraqi civil war 
would spread past its borders, Beers said. 
<P>"How do you get the violence outside of the country?" he asked. "Iraqis 
are not going to invade another country. Scenarios are that Iran might march in 
to protect the Shias, that Turkey might march in because the Kurds are 
destabilizing Turkey. The Saudis might at least be prepared to arm the Sunnis. 
Those are all adding fuel to the fire in Iraq  --  not expanding conflict 
outside of Iraq." 
<P>Apocalyptic scenarios of regional war also were floated by Clinton 
administration officials during the Bosnia and Kosovo conflicts in the 1990s, 
said John Mueller, chairman of national security studies at Ohio State 
University. The term used by then-CIA director James Woolsey was that the civil 
war would "metastasize" across Europe. 
<P>In Iraq, Mueller said, "The most likely scenario, and it's still a fairly 
bad one, is that the other countries would contain Iraq and there would be a 
civil war that would gradually work its way out. The idea of it spreading 
throughout the Middle East and all over the world strikes me as a considerable 
stretch. Not that it's impossible. But the best analogy would be the long civil 
war in Lebanon. Other countries meddled in various ways, but they also kept it 
there, as much as possible." 
<P>A regional war would be terrible for the region, Mandelbaum said. "But as 
cynical, as cold-blooded as it may sound, we have to ask what interests of ours 
would be jeopardized. ... It seems to me it's worth taking a look at our 
options and not assuming that all options are worse than this one." 
<P>Ethnic cleansing would probably get worse after a U.S. withdrawal, most 
believe. It has become worse with each year of the U.S. occupation. The troop 
increase is designed to provide "breathing space" for the warring parties to 
reconcile. But there is little indication of any desire to do so. 
<P>"People might draw back from the brink or it may be that the civil war has 
to play itself out," Mandelbaum said. "In any event, if the United States 
withdrew or drew back, at least our troops wouldn't be getting killed and 
surely the first obligation of the American government is to the people of the 
United States, and that includes the U.S. armed forces." 
<P>Sen. John McCain, an Arizona Republican, GOP presidential hopeful and 
Vietnam War hero who supports sending more troops to Iraq, said the difference 
between Vietnam and Iraq is that the North Vietnamese didn't "follow us home." 
<P>"They're going to follow us home no matter what, so the idea that if we 
prevail in Iraq that suddenly our situation at home in the United States is 
going to improve dramatically, I think is a very questionable proposition," 
said Campbell, the former Clinton national security official. "That does not 
mean that I don't and everyone else doesn't want to win in Iraq. But I think 
that the more logical consequences of failure are really not so much in 
potential terrorist threats at home. That's something we're going to live with 
for decades." 
<P>What about oil? None of the neighboring states, including Iran, want to 
see their oil revenues disrupted. If Iran sponsored small-scale terrorist 
attacks on oil tankers, analysts said, the United States retains enormous naval 
capacity to protect Persian Gulf shipping lanes with convoys  --  as it did in 
the Gulf War. As for Iraq's oil, its production today is below what it was 
before the invasion. 
<P>"I guess my bottom line comes down to this," Riedel said. "Yes, this 
situation is likely to be uglier and messier after we go, but it is already a 
catastrophe."
<P><b>'Nightmare scenario' </b>
<P>President Bush, Vice 
President Dick Cheney and others have argued that a withdrawal of American 
troops from Iraq will lead to a cataclysmic situation. Some of their recent 
remarks: 
<P><i>"If American forces step back before Baghdad is secure, the Iraqi 
government would be overrun by extremists on all sides. We could expect an epic 
battle between Shia extremists backed by Iran, and Sunni extremists aided by al 
Qaeda and supporters of the old regime. A contagion of violence could spill out 
across the country  --  and in time, the entire region could be drawn in to the 
conflict." 
</i>
<P><i>"For America, this is a nightmare scenario. For the enemy, this is the 
objective. Chaos is their greatest ally in this struggle." </i>
<P>--  President Bush, State of the Union address Tuesday 

<P><i>"Whatever one's views on how we got to this point in Iraq, there is 
widespread agreement that failure there would be a calamity that would haunt 
our nation in the future and in the region. The violence in Iraq, if unchecked, 
could spread outside its borders and draw other states into a regional 
conflagration. In addition, one would see an emboldened and strengthened Iran, 
a safe haven and base of operations for jihadist networks in the heart of the 
Middle East, a humiliating defeat in the overall campaign against violent 
extremism worldwide, and an undermining of the credibility of the United 
States."</i> 
<P>--  Defense Secretary Robert Gates, Jan. 11 
<P><i>"But the biggest problem we face right now is the danger that the United 
States will validate the terrorist strategy, that, in fact, what will happen 
here with all of the debate over whether or not we ought to stay in Iraq, with 
the pressures from some quarters to get out of Iraq, if we were to do that, we 
would simply validate the terrorists' strategy that says the Americans will not 
stay to complete the task  --  that we don't have the stomach for the fight." </i>
