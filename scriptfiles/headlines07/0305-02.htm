<p>Far more than previously acknowledged, the battle against global warming 
will be won or lost in China, even more so than in the West, new data show.  
<P>A report released last week by Beijing authorities indicated that as its 
economy continues to expand at a red-hot pace, China is highly likely to 
overtake the United States this year or in 2008 as the world's largest emitter 
of greenhouse gases.

This information, along with data from the International Energy Agency, 
the Paris-based alliance of oil importing nations, also revealed that China's 
greenhouse gas emissions have recently been growing by a total amount much 
greater than that of all industrialized nations put together.  
<P>"The magnitude of what's happening in China threatens to wipe out what's 
happening internationally," said David Fridley, leader of the China Energy 
Group at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. 
<P>"Today's global warming problem has been caused mainly by us in the West, 
with the cumulative (carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases) in the 
atmosphere, but China is contributing to the global warming problem of 
tomorrow." 
<P>New statistics released in Beijing on Wednesday by China's National Bureau 
of Statistics show that China's consumption of fossil fuels rose in 2006 by 9.3 
percent, about the same rate as in previous years  --  and about eight times 
higher than the U.S. increase of 1.2 percent.  

<P>While China's total greenhouse gas emissions were only 42 percent of the 
U.S. level in 2001, they had soared to an estimated 97 percent of the American 
level by 2006. 
<P>"The new data are not encouraging," said Yang Fuqiang, China director for 
the Energy Foundation, a San Francisco organization that works extensively with 
Lawrence Berkeley scientists and the Chinese government on energy-saving 
programs. "China will overtake the United States much faster than expected as 
the No. 1 emitter." 
<P>China's top environmental official admitted Wednesday that the results 
show the government's environment agenda of the past few years has been 
ineffective. 
<P>"Economic growth is still excessive ... and there is slow progress in 
restructuring obsolete and backward production capacity," said Zhou Shengxian, 
director of the State Environmental Protection Agency.  
<P>"The new data show that many local officials are more concerned about 
economic development, about increasing gross domestic product, and see energy 
efficiency and environmental protection as a lower priority," said Yang, of the 
Energy Foundation. 
<P>In an attempt to force local governments to obey energy-efficiency edicts 
from Beijing, the government recently announced that local officials' pay and 
promotion will be judged in part based on their environmental record, not just 
their economic success. The first evaluation period will be in July. 
<P>China's emergence as a global warming polluter has been intensely 
controversial in international negotiations over climate change. 
<P>The Bush administration refused to join the Kyoto Protocol in part because 
the pact committed only industrialized nations, but not fast-growing poorer 
nations like China, to reduce their emissions of greenhouse gases. 
<P>Chinese officials, however, note that the country's per capita emissions 
are far below those in the West, and they say any move to adopt mandatory cuts 
now would restrain its economic growth and in effect penalize its 1.3 billion 
people for being poor. The officials say China must be given the chance to 
attain the West's standard of prosperity before it will cut emissions. 
<P>"It must be pointed out that climate change has been caused by the 
long-term historic emissions of developed countries and their high per-capita 
emissions," China's Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, Jiang Yu, said last month. 
<P>"Developed countries bear an unshirkable responsibility," she said, adding 
that they should "lead the way in assuming responsibility for emissions cuts." 
<P>International negotiations have begun over a successor pact to the Kyoto 
Protocol, and industrial nations  --  and most environmentalists  --  are 
insisting that big developing nations such as China, India and Brazil commit to 
reductions. 
<P>China's hard line may finally be softening, however. 
<P>The Chinese government recently admitted that global warming will 
dramatically impact China's ability to feed its people. A government report 
released in January said that climate change will cause China's production of 
wheat, corn and rice to drop by as much as 37 percent over the next 50 years. 
<P>Precipitation over the country's northern grainbelt is expected to drop 
markedly, causing worsened droughts and dust storms, while increased flooding 
and typhoons are expected in the subtropical south, the report said.  
<P>What China needs, many experts say, is help from the United States and 
other Western nations to help adopt energy-saving technologies. China's energy 
consumption per unit of production is 40 percent higher than the world's 
average, and about 70 percent of its energy comes from coal, usually burned in 
highly inefficient power plants. 
<P>The U.S. Energy Department carries out some technical cooperation with 
China on issues such as coal, but most forms of U.S. assistance to China have 
been barred under sanctions imposed by Congress after the 1989 Tiananmen 
killings in Beijing. 

<P>Although Chinese officials say their country should receive foreign grants 
and subsidies, the Central Bank has the world's highest foreign-exchange 
reserves, at $1.1 trillion, so most experts say China needs training and 
technology rather than cash. 
<P>China has much to learn from California, said Barbara Finamore, director 
of the China program of the Natural Resources Defense Council. 
<P>The state's Energy Commission and Public Utilities Commission have 
exchanged information with their counterparts in China in recent years, but 
Finamore said much more is needed to help spread California's energy-efficient 
ways. 
<P>"This is what China is missing," Finamore said, referring to the state's 
complex mix of efficiency standards for buildings, appliances and industry. "We 
have no national energy-efficiency program, but 20 U.S. states use them, and 
China is on the brink of using them."</p>
