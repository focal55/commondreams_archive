Their names and the charges they face are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Deette Beghtol, 64, charged with Disorderly Conduct in the Second Degree and Interfering with a Police Officer.</li>
<li>Linda Wiener, 49, charged with Interfering with a Police Officer.</li>
<li>Patricia Schwiebert, 61, charged with Disorderly Conduct in the Second Degree and Interfering with a Police Officer.</li>
<li>Martha Odom, 66, charged with Disorderly Conduct in the Second Degree and Interfering with a Police Officer.</li>
<li>Sara Graham, 66, charged with Disorderly Conduct in the Second Degree and Interfering with a Police Officer.</li>
<li>Ann Huntwork, 75, charged with Disorderly Conduct in the Second Degree and Interfering with a Police Officer.</li>
</ul>
<p>They are set to be in court March 7.</p>
<p>The group, part of Portland Surge Protection Brigade, has held a protest outside the Armed Forces Career Center office during three successive weeks.</p>
<p>"It's very simple," Schwiebert said. "We just don't want our children coming in here and getting enlisted."</p>
<p>On Friday, the protesters spoke out about the government sending more troops to Iraq and tried to prevent people from going inside the office - including those already enlisted trying to get to work.</p>
<p>"We're trying to save your life," one protester told an unidentified man entering the building.</p>
<p>"Yeah, these soldiers are trying to save your lives as well," he responded.</p>
<p>"If they want to be out here protesting that's fine," the man told KATU News. "But I have a right to go in as well."</p>
<p>The "grannies" said no one wins when soldiers are dying and being wounded.</p>
<p>"Tell them about the folks we've seen come back from Iraq who have incredible psychological responses to what they've been through," one protester said.</p>
<p>At some point Friday, the grandmothers grew bolder and began going inside the recruiting office building, which is private property. That caused police to move in. After being warned they would face arrest, the protesters were arrested.</p>
<p>"It's worth it if we kept one person from being recruited, one more person going over to Iraq, yes. Absolutely," Wiener said.</p>
<p>Members of the group promised to return to the office.</p>
<p>"I don't expect that this will be our last visit here," one protester said.</p>
