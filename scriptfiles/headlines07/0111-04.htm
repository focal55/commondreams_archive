<p>A series of events involving a local liberal blogger, a San Francisco 
conservative radio station and the reaction of two of the larger corporate 
advertisers in the country  --  Bank of America and MasterCard  --  is 
revealing how slippery freedom of speech has become in the digital age.  
<P>The tale of Spocko, a self-described "fifth-tier" blogger who lives in San 
Francisco, exemplifies how one person with a computer and an Internet hookup 
can challenge the views of a major media corporation  --  and what a media 
corporation will do to stop him. 
<P>For the past year, Spocko has been e-mailing advertisers of KSFO-AM with 
audio clips from its shows and asking sponsors to examine what they're 
supporting. Some sponsors have pulled their ads, after hearing clips like one 
of KSFO's Lee Rodgers suggesting that a protester be "stomped to death right 
there. Just stomp their bleeping guts out."  
<P>Now, bloggers and media freedom advocates are concerned about the legal 
reaction from Disney/ABC-owned KSFO. Shortly before Christmas, an ABC lawyer 
demanded that Spocko remove audio clips from his blog on the grounds that 
Spocko's posting of KSFO content was illegal. Digital freedom advocates counter 
that the clips constitute fair use and worry that critical voices could be 
silenced by corporations threatening legal action for violation of copyright 
law.  
<P>"That's inevitably been the modus operandi of the media companies in these 
types of situations," said Ronald Coleman, legal counsel for the Media Bloggers 
Association, which provides legal support to bloggers. "It doesn't matter the 
size of the blogger." 

<P>Spocko, who asked that his real name not be used because he fears 
retaliation, is a hobby blogger; he says he gets 15 visitors a day  --  and no 
advertisers  --  to his political and media criticism blog.  
<P>A little over a year ago, he became so annoyed by the "violent" tone of 
commentary on KSFO-AM that he and some of his readers e-mailed more than three 
dozen of the station's advertisers.  
<P>"I want to emphasize that if you withdraw your ads you aren't limiting 
their free speech, just removing your paid support of it," Spocko wrote to 
advertisers.  
<P>In a statement Wednesday, KSFO program director Ken Berry said, "Many of 
the remarks attributed to KSFO on the Internet are old, lacking context and, in 
some cases, outright lies. When our hosts have stepped over the line, they have 
apologized and have been reprimanded." 
<P>Berry declined to specify Wednesday which remarks were old or lies or who 
was reprimanded. Instead, at noon Friday, KSFO will pre-empt regular 
programming to allow four KSFO personalities cited in Spocko's e-mails to 
answer questions on-air about the controversy from the public, bloggers and 
media. "I don't tell people what to say, but I do think there will be some mea 
culpas there," Berry said.  
<P>Berry said KSFO will invite Spocko to appear on the air, but the blogger 
has declined such invitations in the past, saying in an e-mail to The 
Chronicle, "I'd be just another revenue generating 'event' for them to their 
audience, and they would love that kind of 'controversy' because it would MAKE 
them money and they still had control."  
<P>The station didn't have control over what Spocko sent to sponsors. 
<P>Among the clips circulated to advertisers was one of morning show co-host 
Melanie Morgan saying of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, "We've got a bull's-eye 
painted on her big laughing eyes." Morgan said she has never called for 
anybody's assassination and was speaking merely in political terms, as she is 
researching Pelosi's background for a book proposal. "Yes, this is a freedom of 
speech issue, and this individual is entitled to say what he wants to," said 
Morgan. "But he's trying to take away my livelihood, and I'm not trying to take 
away his."  
<P>After his Internet service provider received a letter from ABC lawyers, 
Spocko pulled down the 30 audio clips on his blog. But supporters have taken up 
his cause on influential liberal blogs like DailyKos and firedoglake, and 
reposted the clips all over the Web, arguing that Spocko's freedom of digital 
speech must be protected. A supportive YouTube video featuring some of the 
clips drew more than 31,000 viewers within days.  
<P>"One thing the Internet is good for is holding people accountable for 
their speech," said Karl Frisch, a spokesman for the liberal watchdog group 
Media Matters. For months, the organization has posted an online petition 
urging media outlets to not give a platform to "conservative hate merchants" 
like Morgan. 
<P>An attorney with the Electronic Frontier Foundation said Spocko didn't do 
anything that millions of bloggers don't do every day: post commentary 
alongside slices of copyrighted material.  
<P>"This is prototypical fair use of copyrighted material," said Matt 
Zimmerman, an attorney with the San Francisco civil liberties and digital 
privacy organization. EFF is not representing Spocko, but has reviewed his 
situation and is monitoring it. "Bloggers shouldn't have to be worried about 
being sued every time they post a screen shot from 'The Simpsons.' " 
<P>Spocko described himself as a communications professional, but is not a 
journalist and does not work for a KSFO competitor and is not a former or 
current station employee. Most of the clips he circulated were pulled from a 
morning drive-time show on KSFO co-hosted by Morgan and Rodgers and from an 
evening program hosted by Brian Sussman.  
<P>In one audio clip making the rounds, Sussman tells a caller: "I would take 
it that you're probably Muslim." 
<P>"No," the caller said, "I'm independent. I don't subscribe."  
<P>"Why don't you right now say Allah is a whore and that would prove it to 
me," Sussman said. 
<P>After receiving an e-mail from Spocko's group last spring about the 
station's content, KSFO advertiser Bank of America reviewed other programming 
on the station. Eventually, the corporation pulled its advertising after 
hearing material it felt was polarizing. MasterCard, which received similar 
e-mails about KSFO's programming, also decided not to advertise again on 
Sussman's show.  

<P>The Michigan Economic Development Corp. asked its ad buyer to exclude KSFO 
if it purchases time on the ABC radio network. Said spokesman Michael Shore on 
Wednesday: "The speech was about as offensive as one could imagine." 
<P>Spocko said it would be dangerous to dismiss the comments he's heard on 
KSFO as the sort of ratings-boosting hyperbole endemic to talk radio, even if 
it's uttered in the name of entertainment.  
<P>"It's entertainment until somebody is attacked," Spocko said. "Until it 
crosses the line, which I think this does."</p>
