<p>It began as it has begun every week for the past two years. First flag waving, then chanting and marching along the high street of the West Bank village of Bil'in until the demonstrators, yesterday several hundred in number, reached the barrier.</p>

There, facing a group of Israeli soldiers, they stood before the yellow metal gate and the barbed wire fences, and continued chanting their opposition to Israel's half-built 437-mile barrier that snakes through the West Bank and which the Bil'in villagers say has taken half their land. Beyond the barrier and over the hill is the beginning of the largest Jewish settlement in the occupied territories, Modi'in Illit.</p>
<p>And, as happens every week, there was pushing and shoving, then a volley of stones thrown by boys some distance away from the demonstrators. The Israeli military fired stun grenades and dozens of rounds of tear gas, before eventually bringing out a water cannon to disperse the crowd. Sixteen people were injured, four of whom were taken to hospital.</p>
<p>The reason that Bil'in is an exception is that the demonstrators here are Palestinians and Israelis, a rare mix of people who march and chant and espouse non-violence together. At a time of deadlock in peace negotiations between the Israeli and Palestinian leaders, the weekly protests at Bil'in, which had their second anniversary yesterday, are the highest profile joint action between two, often bitterly divided sides.</p>
<p>Near the front of the crowd was Uri Avnery, 83, a former Israeli MP and one of the better known activists on the Israeli left. "This village is unique even in Palestine because it is the only village that has the guts to fight against the wall actively every single week," he said.</p>
<p>"Israeli public opinion does not know anything about it, they don't want to know anything about it. We want to compel them to take notice that this so-called security obstacle has nothing to do at all with security. This is a wall which is robbing the villagers of most of their land and giving this land to Israeli settlers on the other side."</p>
<p>Standing near him in the crowd was Mustafa Barghouti, a moderate Palestinian MP. "Bil'in has given the best example of non-violent struggle and resistance to the Israeli measures," he said. "It is a message that we will never accept this apartheid wall and enslavement."</p>
<p>Mr Barghouti's criticisms were echoed in a report this week by the UN special rapporteur on human rights in the Palestinian territories, John Dugard, which contained some of the most forceful criticism yet of Israel's policies in the territories, likening them to those of apartheid South Africa.</p>
<p>However, the reality is that the joint action has failed to change the route of the barrier at Bil'in or to rally broader attention across the Israeli public. There are still four cases about Bil'in before the Israeli courts, but few expect any significant victories. When finished, the barrier will place 10.1% of the West Bank and east Jerusalem on the "Israeli" side. The Israeli government argues that the barrier's sole purpose is security and says it has dramatically cut the number of suicide attacks.</p>
<p>After the activism of the 1990s descended into suicide bombings that killed hundreds of Israelis, disillusionment and frustration spread. Palestinians talk of the increase in the number of checkpoints, the growth of settlements and now the barrier - all steadily shrinking Palestinian land. The Israelis who turn out at Bil'in say they are regarded as "radical left" by the rest of their country.</p>
<p>For Ofer Shorr, 39, a translator from Haifa, yesterday was his first appearance at a protest. He stood in the crowd holding a banner that read "the wall must fall". "We are enclosing them in a sort of ghetto and in a sense this is encircling Israel too," he said. But it was hard to get the point across in Israeli society, where he said such views were discounted as irrelevant. "Israelis have become very defensive and guarded about the whole peace process."</p>
<p>As clouds of tear gas flooded over the hillside at Bil'in, the crowd retreated, holding scarves to their faces or breathing through onion halves to overcome the noxious fumes. Groups of Palestinian boys used long slingshots to hurl stones over the fields at the soldiers.</p>
<p>Gad Miron, an Israeli, stood looking down the hillside at the barrier with his wife, Sara, a maths teacher, who said: "It really hurts us that we are still occupying the territories. But we have no leadership to change the situation. There is a deep fear that started with the Holocaust and this fear is behind the actions of the government. We cannot be delivered of this fear," she said. "But we are putting ourselves in danger with what we are doing."</p>
