There were thousands of them - Christians fighting Christians north of Beirut, Sunni and Shia Muslims in the capital, a rain of stones, shrieks of hatred and occasionally even gunfire - that turned Lebanon into a sectarian battleground yesterday. </p>

At the corner of a street off Corniche al-Mazraa, I watched what historians 
  may one day claim was the first day of Lebanon's new civil war, huge mobs of 
  young men, supporters and opponents of Fouad Siniora's government screaming 
  abuse and throwing tens of thousands of rocks at each other as a wounded 
  Lebanese soldier sat next to me and wept. 
</p>
<p>
  For the army of this tragic country is now the thin red line &shy; some actually 
  were wearing red berets &shy; that stands between a future for Lebanon and the 
  folly of civil conflict. 
</p>
<p>
  After 31 years in this country, I never truly believed I would see again 
  what I witnessed on the streets of Beirut yesterday, thousands of Shia and 
  Sunni Muslims, the first supporting the Hizbollah, the second the government 
  once led by the murdered ex-prime minister Rafik Hariri, hurling stones and 
  hunks of metal at each other. They crashed down around us, smashing the road 
  signs, the advertisement hoardings, the windows of the bank against which 
  seven Lebanese soldiers and I were cowering. Again and again, the soldiers 
  ran into the roadway to try &shy; with a desperation all of them understood, and 
  they were brave men &shy; to drag the youths from each other. Some of the Shia 
  men, Amal members, loyal (heaven spare us) to the Speaker of Parliament, 
  wore hoods and black face masks, most wielding big wooden clubs.

</p>
<p>
  Their predecessors &shy; perhaps their fathers &shy; were dressed like this 31 years 
  ago when they fought in these same streets, executioners-to-be, all 
  confident in the integrity of their cause. Perhaps they were even wearing 
  the same hoods. Some of the troops fired into the air; they shouted at the 
  stone throwers. "For God's love, stop," one young soldier 
  screamed. "Please, please." 
</p>
<p>
  But the crowds would not listen. They shrieked "animals" at each 
  other and obscenities and on one side of the street they produced pictures 
  of the Hizbollah leader, Hassan Nasrallah, and of Michel Aoun, the Christian 
  ex-general who wants to be president and is Nasrallah's ally, and on the 
  other side of the street, the Sunnis produced a portrait of Saddam Hussein. 
  Thus did the cancer of Iraq spread to Lebanon yesterday. It was a day of 
  shame. 
</p>
<p>
  Across Lebanon came reports of dying men &shy; two according to one, six 
  according to another, and at least 60 wounded &shy; and the country's leaders 
  were last night writing their narrative of Lebanon's modern history with 
  predictable speed. Nasrallah, hero of last summer's war with Israel &shy; or so 
  he likes to think &shy; demanding the resignation of the government while 
  Siniora and his colleagues, trapped in the old Turkish "serail" 
  downtown, called this an attempted coup d'&eacute;tat by the forces of Syria and 
  Iran. 

</p>
<p>
  It is not that simple. The Shias are the downtrodden, the poor, the 
  dispossessed, those who have always been ignored by the dons and patriarchs 
  of the Lebanese government &shy; for in one sense this is also a social 
  revolution &shy; and on the other were the Sunni population so beloved of Hariri 
  and the Druze and the Christians still loyal to the Lebanese forces who were 
  Israel's allies in 1982 and who massacred the Palestinians in the camps of 
  Sabra and Chatila, as well as a majority of Lebanese innocents who voted 
  Siniora's government into power. 
</p>
<p>
  Thus north of Beirut, Aoun's Christian forces tried to block the roads and 
  were set on by Samir Geagea's thugs. In Tripoli, supporters of Hariri's son 
  Saad were fighting Alawite supporters of Syria. In Hazmiyeh, it was Shias 
  versus Christians and in Corniche al-Mazraa, it was Shias against Sunnis. 
  No, as Nasrallah would be the first to say, this is not necessarily a civil 
  war &shy; and it has to be said that the Hizbollah's tens of thousands of 
  fighters were by far the most disciplined men on the streets of Beirut &shy; but 
  it was he who called a general strike yesterday on the eve of the Paris 
  economic conference that is supposed to save Lebanon's economy and who 
  blocked all the main roads of Lebanon with burning tyres and concrete blocks 
  and pipes and rubble from last summer's war. 
</p>

<p>
  My driver, Abed, and I tried to reach the airport but vast swaths of black 
  smoke poured from the burning rubber on all the approach roads. I walked 
  three miles to the terminal, only to find the Hizbollah protecting both the 
  airport and the Lebanese troops who were guarding it. When we turned round, 
  Abed tried to drive over the burning tyres but trapped one beneath our car, 
  the flames curling up the sides of the bodywork, desperately reversing to 
  clear our wheels as Hizbollah men screamed abuse. 
</p>
<p>
  Siniora condemned it all last night, demanding an emergency session of 
  parliament. He still plans to go to the Paris summit. But how will he get to 
  the airport? "We will not be scared," Nasrallah said yesterday. "
We will not retreat ... We will not be dragged on to the streets [of civil 
  war]." But he should have been on Corniche al-Mazraa. All across 
  Beirut, the Hizbollah, most dressed in black trousers and shirts (for this 
  is the holy month of Ashura, is it not?) had closed the roads, and the army 
  stood and watched. It is a largely Shia army, for it is the Shias who are 
  the largest community in Lebanon, but in the streets they were forced to 
  fight. As I sat with the soldiers amid the crashing stones &shy; many of the 
  projectiles hurled into the street from the roofs of eight-storey apartment 
  blocks &shy; I watched them wilt under the pressure. One knelt down and vomited; 
  others were almost overcome by their own tear gas, fired uselessly at the 
  vast crowds. For these were not Belfast-sized riots or Gaza-sized 
  demonstrations.
</p>
<p>
  The mobs were there in their thousands, chorusing their hatred for those who 
  lived across the other side of the boulevard. There were few officers. But 
  after an hour, a Lebanese colonel ran down the street, a smartly dressed 
  man, not even wearing a flak jacket, who walked straight into the highway 
  between these two great waves of angry people, the stones banging off his 
  helmet and body and legs. And the soldiers around me stood up and ran into 
  the road to join him between these two enormous forces. 
</p>
<p>

  I don't like journalists who fall in love with armies. I don't like armies. 
  But yesterday it seemed that this one man was a lonely symbol of what stood 
  between Lebanon and chaos. I don't know his religion. His soldiers were 
  Sunnis and Shias and Christians &shy; I had checked, of course &shy; all dressed in 
  the same uniform. Could they hold together, could they remain under his 
  command when their brothers and cousins, some of them, must have been among 
  the crowds? They did. Some even grinned as they hurled themselves at the 
  hooded men and youths too young to have known the last civil war, pleading 
  and shouting for the violence to end. They won. This time. But what about 
  today?
