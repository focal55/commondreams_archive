<p>Speaker
Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) is facing a full-blown revolt from liberal
House Democrats over the $98 billion Iraq supplemental bill, according
to Democratic insiders. Anywhere between 50 to 75 Democrats are now
threatening to vote against the bill because it doesn't go far enough
toward ending the war, including&nbsp;setting a date certain for
withdrawal of U.S. combat forces from Iraq, said the sources. Pelosi
and Democratic leaders are expected to postpone markup of the Iraq bill
in the House Appropriations Committee by at least a week in order to
buy time to&nbsp;resolve the matter.
<p>Liberals are unhappy with the current proposal being discussed by
Rep. John Murtha (D-Pa.) and the Democratic leadership, which would
prevent President Bush from sending more troops to Iraq unless they are
certified as being properly equipped, trained and rested to take on
combat missions. After weeks of political attacks from Republicans,
Murtha softened his original proposal so that Bush can waive the
requirements, although the White House would have to report to Congress
why they are issuing such waivers. The Blue Dog Coalition, a group of
moderate and conservative Democrats from swing districts, also wanted
Murtha to&nbsp;revise his proposal.</p>

<p>But as happens so often in politics, if you move too far in
appeasing one group, you then alienate another, which is what's
happening here. Liberals Dems now don't want to vote for the Iraq
supplemental, with many pointing out to Pelosi and party leaders that
they never have voted for one before and aren't about to start doing so
now just because Democrats are in the majority.
These&nbsp;Democrats&nbsp;also want to offer their own alternative
proposal to cut off Iraq funding immediately as an amendment to
the&nbsp;supplemental&nbsp;on the House floor, said Democratic
leadership aides.</p>
<p>Liberals Democrats like Rep. Maxine Waters (Calif.),&nbsp;co-chairwoman&nbsp;of the <a href="http://www.house.gov/list/speech/ca35_waters/floor_051102_iraqcaucus.html" target="_new">Out of Iraq Caucus</a>,
want to end the war now, so they want a date certain for a withdrawal
or pullout or "strategic redeployment," and they want it in the Iraq
supplemental or they won't vote for it. "They figure that we won the
election on a promise to end the war, and they want to live up to that
promise," said a senior House Democratic lawmaker who spoke on the
condition of anonymity. "It's a tough place the speaker is in right
now, but we'll work all this out."</p>
<p>Pelosi has a bit&nbsp;of a&nbsp;problem here. If the Democratic
leadership puts a date certain for withdrawal in the bill, there's a
chance that enough Blue Dog Democrats would defect and vote with
Republicans, meaning the bill could go down&nbsp;to defeat outright.
While that might suit anti-war lawmakers and groups, the political
consequences could be disastrous for the party. It would end the Iraq
war by default since there would be no more money for combat
operations, and Republicans would punish the Democrats for years over
it.</p>

<p>But if she leaves out a date-certain withdrawal, Pelosi may lose her
left, and that's her power base, both within the Democratic Caucus and
the party at large. She faces a very ticklish&nbsp;task sorting the
whole thing out, although the senior Democrat lawmaker isn't worried.
Pelosi "will get everyone on board at the end of the day," the lawmaker
insisted.</p>
<p>The House Democratic Caucus will met at 12 p.m. on Tuesday, and Iraq
will be at the top of the agenda, according to Democratic sources.</p>
