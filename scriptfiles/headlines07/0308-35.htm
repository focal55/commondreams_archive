<p>CROSS RIVER, N.Y. -- A Westchester, N.Y., public high school has suspended three 16-year-old girls for saying the word "vagina" during a reading from "The Vagina Monologues." John Jay High School Principal Richard Leprine said the girls were punished because they disobeyed orders not to say the word "vagina". 

<p>No, don't worry, I don't intend to become some kind of expert re the treatment of reproductive organs in American literature or in American schools. I have actually been  contemplating an article about the beauties of being an ex-super power for a while. But a couple of weeks ago "scrotum", now "vagina". What's next?

<p>When a friend sent me this piece last night, I winced - as probably all of you do. Makes you wonder. Particularly on International Women's Day!!

<p>We learn that for Mr Leprine, uttering the word "vagina" in public has to be avoided at all costs and punished - although I'd be curious to learn what exactly the play "The Vagina Monologues" was called instead at the John Jay High School in Westchester if "vagina" was not to be mentioned. "Elastic Muscular Tube Monologues"?

<p>Mr Leprine's own explanation for his move can be found on John Jay High School's <a href="http://jjhs.klschools.org/home.aspx" target="_new">homepage</a>. 
<p>His letter on the homepage is full of my pet phrases - whenever any scandal relating to any part of the body which might be used during sexual intercourse occurs in America, everybody's favorites are expressions like "the sensitivities of the community", "young children may be in attendance", "younger siblings, often elementary age, attend these types of events", "not to present specified material" - I guess he means vagina - "because of the composition of the audience". Here we go again. Protecting the innocence of America's children.

<p>Being inquisitive by nature, I've been trying to probe deeper into the true reasons for this extraordinary action and figure out why Mr Leprine and his "sensitive community" - see above - seem to harbor an aversion to the word "vagina", sorry, "specified material", as he calls it in his letter. 

<p>These are my hypotheses so far:
<p>
<ol>
<li> Mr Leprine himself has no "specified material", as far as we know, so this is pure vagina envy. As a consequence, he can't bear to be reminded of the fact.</li>
<li> Mr Leprine and members of his sensitive community once attended a therapeutic session where under hypnosis they relived their own birth experience. This was very painful and traumatic; Baby Leprine and baby members of his sensitive community were probably stuck in the vaginal part of the birth canal for a while. For the rest, see 1).</li>
<li> Mr Leprine's birth and the births of members of his sensitive community were the result of a Caesarean. Vaginal delivery envy was the result. Again, see 1).</li>
<li> Mr Leprine and members of his sensitive community are unhappy with their lives, and since their mothers' "specified material" played an important role in their creation on at least one, but probably on two occasions, they all hold the female vagina personally responsible for their plight.</li>
<li> Mr Leprine and members of his sensitive community think that any mention of "vagina" would make innocent children curious about what a vagina is, where it is located and what you can do with it. They might even try to find it and investigate its possible usages. In that case, Westchester must be one of these rare islands which have to TV, no internet, no movie theaters, no libraries and no newspapers. Amazing that they ever heard about Eve Ensler's play.</li>
<li> John Jay High School students and even their younger siblings have heard about vaginas after all but are unaware of the side-effects of exploring it. Mentioning the word in a play might thus trigger rampant sex, Mr Leprine and members of his sensitive community fear. One wonders about the quality of Biology teaching at this august institution.</li>
<li> Mr Leprine and members of his sensitive community consider female reproductive organs to be "dirty". Any reproductive organs are "dirty", come to think of it. And mentioning them is "dirty". Young children might be arrested in their mental development if they heard the word and they would surely suffer severe traumas which might accompany them for the rest of their lives. As adults, they might sue Mr Leprine for millions of dollars because the word "vagina" destroyed their chances to live happy and balanced lives. </li>
</ol> 
<p>If you have any further suggestions, I'd be curious to her about them.

<p>Generally, I will never be able to understand why anybody of any age must not hear words like "vagina". Why kindergarten children learn all other parts of a human body but not about the existence of the female vagina. After all, that was part of their journey into the world! What is supposed to happen if they heard it??

<p>To avoid further embarrassments and scandals, all like-minded "sensitive communities" in America would be well-advised to propagate in-vitro-fertilization plus Caesarean deliveries. At least for the time being. Until science can create humans without the any interference of all kinds of "specified material". Check visions of reproduction without unsuitable and dirty body contact in Aldous Huxley's "Brave New World" - absolutely suitable to hear about for all ages.

<p>I hope Eve Ensler is having a ball.
