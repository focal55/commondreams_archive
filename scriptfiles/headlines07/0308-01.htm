<p>BEIJING  -- China on Thursday accused
the United States of trampling on Iraq's sovereignty, saying Washington
was using its campaign against terrorism as an excuse to torture people
around the world and violate the rights of its own citizens.
<p>The
charges came in a report titled the "Human Rights Record of the United
States in 2006," China's response to U.S. criticism of Beijing's human
rights record in a report Tuesday by the State Department.</p>

<p>"As
in previous years, the State Department pointed the finger at human
rights conditions in more than 190 countries and regions, including
China, but avoided touching on the human rights situation in the United
States," the Chinese report said.</p>

<p>At a news
conference, Foreign Ministry spokesman Qin Gang called China's report a
"mirror" to "let the Americans see their own human rights condition."</p>

<p>The
U.S. thinks it has "the right to make irresponsible remarks toward
other countries and have double standards," he said, but would not
elaborate on why. He also said China would like to give the U.S. books
on the ideas of Confucius to help improve its government.</p>

<p>The
report, the eighth year China has answered the State Department's
annual report on human rights around the world, was released by the
State Council, China's cabinet, through the Xinhua News Agency.</p>

<p>It
said the United States has used its military power to trespass on the
sovereignty of other countries and violate human rights.</p>

<p>The
Chinese report cites U.S. news stories estimating that more than
655,000 Iraqis have died in Iraq since war started in March 2003, and
repeats charges of atrocities carried out by U.S. forces there.</p>

<p>It
said the United States has "a flagrant record" of violating the Geneva
Convention by systematically abusing prisoners in Iraq and in
Afghanistan, citing the mistreatment of prisoners in Baghdad's Abu
Ghraib prison.</p>

<p>The report said the
international image of the United States had been hurt by these rights
violations it said were carried out under the banner of "safeguarding
human rights".</p>

<p>China also said the United
States had a poor domestic human rights record, with its citizens
suffering "increasing civil rights infringements" under security
measures imposed after the Sept. 11 attacks.</p>

<p>Citing
U.S. reports, it said nearly three-quarters of the terrorism suspects
seized by the United States in the five years since the attacks have
not come to trial due to lack of evidence.</p>

<p>The
report also criticized the United States for not protecting its
citizens' economic and social rights, saying that according to the U.S.
Census Bureau 37 million people lived in poverty in the United States
in 2005, or about one in eight Americans.</p>

<p>"The ethnic minorities are at the bottom of American society," the Chinese report said.</p>

<p>The
document quotes a U.S. Justice Department report that said there were
5.2 million violent crimes in the United States in 2005, the highest
number in 15 years.</p>

<p>The State Department said
China's already poor human rights record deteriorated in 2006, with
officials harassing and arresting reporters, activists and defense
lawyers seeking to exercise their lawful rights.</p>

<p>It
also faulted China for endemic corruption, discrimination against women
and minorities, government control of courts and judges and Internet
censorship.</p>

<p>The State Department said China
had tightened restrictions on press and speech freedoms, executed
people on the day of their conviction or immediately after an appeal
was denied, and restricted people trying to assemble, practice religion
and travel.</p>
