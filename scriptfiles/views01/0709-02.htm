The slaying of Chicago Police Officer Brian T. Strouse, allegedly by a

16-year-old lookout for a drug-dealing street gang, is another item of

evidence indicting the war on drugs.

<P>

   "Drug dealers bring much more violence than we have ever seen in this

country," said Mayor Richard Daley at Thursday's funeral for the 33-year-old

officer. The mayor can be forgiven a little hyperbole during such an emotional

occasion.

<P>



But this city has seen such violence before; in fact, Chicago once was

defined by the violence wrought by a war on alcohol that we called

Prohibition. In those days, drive-by shootings were the work of

tommy-gun-toting gangsters pushing that "demon rum" and other abominations of

the era. That violent war ended in 1933 when Americans finally acknowledged

the self-destructive futility of trying to prohibit alcohol use.

<P>

   "This is war out here and young men die in war," said Chicago Police

Supt.Terry Hillard at Strouse's funeral, reminding us of how history repeats

itself.

<P>

   Hillard's comments mark law enforcement's attitude about their work in this

city's drug-plagued communities; they are in mortal combat and their enemies

are the black and brown youth who ply their trade in the underground economy

of drug commerce.

<P>

   We must ask: Who's winning the drug war?

<P>

   The "war on drugs" policy was officially launched in 1982 by the Reagan

administration and since that time, drug arrests have soared and prison

populations have exploded. According to the Sentencing Project, a sentencing

reform group that does research on criminal-justice issues, drug arrests

reached more than 1.5 million by 1997 and four out of five were for

possession. The group notes those arrests generated an 11-fold increase in the

number of drug offenders in state prisons by 1996.

<P>

   "Dramatic increases occurred in the federal system as well, as the number

of drug offenders rose to 55,194 &#091;from 4,900 in 1980&#093;, representing 60 percent

of all inmates," the group reported in a recent fact sheet on drug policy.

<P>

   Law enforcement's inordinate focus on fighting a drug war has skewed law

enforcement's crime-fighting priorities, channeling billions in resources to

policies with few social rewards. By imprisoning record numbers of low-level

drug dealers and users, society has created a criminalizing assembly line and

deepened the saturation of prison culture into various inner-city communities.

<P>

   Many street gangs are created in prison and gang connections are nurtured

and reinforced by the lucrative pipeline linking the jails and the streets.

The 16-year-old accused of killing Strouse belonged to a gang that reportedly

was created in one of Illinois' juvenile facilities.

<P>

   But even more damaging to the logic of our drug-fighting policies is the

fact that drugs are more available and less expensive than they were before

the war began.

<P>

   According to the University of Michigan's "Monitoring the Future" survey in

1999, nearly 80 percent of students in the 10th grade and 90 percent of 12th

graders rated marijuana "fairly easy" or "very easy" to obtain. The numbers

were up from 1992. Cocaine was rated "easily available" to 25 percent of the

8th graders. The numbers were up from the 1992 survey.

<P>

   The United Nations Office for Drug Control and Crime Prevention found that

"over the past decade, inflation-adjusted prices in the United States for

cocaine fell by 50 percent and 70 percent for heroin." What's more, the agency

also found that the purity of the street heroin (a trendy drug among

increasing numbers of young people) increased to 37 percent in 1997 from 6

percent in 1987. The purity levels of cocaine and marijuana also have

increased in recent years.

<P>

   Rising purity and lower prices are just more indications of the drug war's

failure. Those mounting failures should convince anyone paying attention that

the war of which Hillard speaks is tearing the nation apart as it enriches its

many profiteers, only some of whom are drug dealers.

<P>

   So even as the battlefield body count continues to climb, we're unlikely to

see a much-needed cease-fire in our shameless war on drugs.

<P>
