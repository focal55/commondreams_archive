SANTA BARBARA<wbr>--<wbr>When Vice President Dick Cheney recently proposed that we look to

nuclear power to ease the energy crunch, I thought about a little-known,

curious experiment conducted in the 1960s and '70s at Brookhaven National

Laboratory on Long Island. During the Cold War, the danger of a nuclear

war or the accidental release of radioactive materials seemed real. To

examine the effects of radiation on natural ecosystems, the federal

government sponsored experiments. At Brookhaven, scientists irradiated an

entire forest.

<p>I was one of the researchers in this forest of dead trees standing.

The forest looked as if it had just burned the day before, though the

trees had actually been dead for years. We could work in the forest up to

four hours a day because the radiation used, cesium's radioactive isotope

137, was relatively 'clean': Only gamma rays were produced. The

laboratory had moved the largest source of cesium 137 that could be

safely handled by earth-moving machinery into the forest and mounted it

on a vertical, movable pole. The pole had devices that lowered the

radioactive material into the ground, where lead shields provided the

protection for researchers.

<p>A journey to the center of the forest--that is, the source of

radiation--after a decade of exposure was surreal. The forest was

enclosed by two chain-link fences with locked gates. Just inside the

fences, the woods were typical of those found on Long Island: a dense

clutch of small pitch pines, scarlet and white oaks, and small shrubs,

mostly blueberry and huckleberry. Many plants were quite fragrant. The

sounds of crickets and cicadas filled the air. Ovenbirds called. My walk

toward the source began as a pleasant stroll through the woods.

<p>As I moved closer, more and more pine trees had dead branches and

needles. Farther on, all the pines were dead, but many were still

standing. Some of the fallen pine trunks were beginning to rot--the

bacteria and fungi of decay had survived the radiation.

<p>Up ahead, the white oaks looked sick. Soon, they, too, were all

dead--and standing. The scarlet oaks proved to be the hardiest of the

trees. As I neared the source, I saw some survivors.

<p>It was like walking up a mountain. The higher up you climb, the

smaller and fewer the trees. Eventually, the trees drop out completely

and you reach a zone of low shrubs, then a tundra zone of smaller ground

plants and, finally, if the mountain is high enough, no life at all.

<p>So it was in the irradiated forest. Blueberries and huckleberries

survived the trees, growing among grasses and sedges. Closer to the

source, only a patchy cover of sedges. Then you came upon perfect

triangles of sedges--green, grass-like, flowering plants--growing behind

the trunks of standing dead trees. Just as they do with sunlight, the

trunks shaded the sedges from the radiation. It was an eerie

demonstration of how light rays travel.

<p>Near ground zero, all plants were dead, but they had not decayed. The

radiation had killed off the armies of decay: fungus, bacteria,

earthworms, etc.

<p>I hunted around for any signs of life. Within about six feet of the

source, I found, on the back of a sign warning of the radiation danger, a

small green patch of the algae Protococcus. The algae grows on damp

soils. The sandy soil encircling the source was tinted gray, the color of

the dead leaves and twigs that had not decayed.

<p>From the air, the forest was an eerily beautiful sight of death

radiating outward. You could see the tower containing the radiation,

surrounded by a lifeless, gray-tan zone. Then came a circular ring of

sedges, one of shrubs, another of oaks without pines and then the healthy

forest. Rather than the intricate mosaic of life forms that characterizes

normal forests, the one at Brookhaven was a series of concentric circles

signifying the stages of death by radiation.

<p>The radioactive waste generated at nuclear power plants can create

similar landscapes. One idea is to bury it. But the radioactive materials

remain dangerous for 10,000 years. A government task force assigned the

job of designing a warning system that could be understood by people

living 100 centuries from now came up with the idea of constructing solid

structures above the waste depository that would emit mournful sounds

when the wind blows.

<p>The irradiated forest at Brookhaven National Laboratory is mournful

indeed. The forest and the problems associated with the transportation

and storage of nuclear wastes are also a mournful prospect, one that

should make us pause and think carefully before we move in the direction

of greater emphasis on nuclear power rather than on energy sources that

are more environmentally benign.
