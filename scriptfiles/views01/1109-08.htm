America at war no longer provides the teary, sweet image of Jimmy

Stewart, charmingly awkward in a lumpy wool uniform, being shipped off

to save the world. No, America's version of war has become utterly

bizarre fifty-six years after World War ll.



<p>In the War against Terror, our professional soldiers (Our "boyz in

hawm's way") are pampered like sumo wrestlers preparing for a big match.

It is a lavish style of warfare that only the world's most expensive

army could possibly afford.



<p>Between greetings to the many on-site television cameras for folks back

home and catching up on the latest flicks, they enjoy hot pepperoni

pizza, gulp Bud Light, and peruse Airforce-expressed copies of Playboy -

all with an intense awareness of serving the forces of goodness and

decency. Their mission is to wait patiently while the top twenty feet of

Afghanistan are reduced to rubble. They are confident their cause is

right knowing that our jets thoughtfully sprinkle the Afghan debris with

emergency food packets.



<p>But wartime life in America, away from the Afghan Front, competes

fiercely for weirdness.



<p>On my last visit to a Mobil station, having followed the pump's

computerized instructions to choose my method of payment and grade of

gasoline, I was filling the tank when a new message started blinking

across the diodes: "Always remember September 11!…God bless

America!…Always remember September 11!…God bless America!…"



<p>I felt cheated by this surreptitious method of lumping Texas-football

patriotism into a $10 gas purchase. Cheated because I had promised

myself not to stop anywhere with "God bless America!" signs. I prefer my

religion and my patriotism stored safely apart, like the two highly

volatile chemical compounds that they are. Buying from stores with "Honk

for America" and "Be Proud to Be an American!" is as far as I go

indulging America's drawling, unshaven, belligerent, belly-over-the-belt

patriotism. When you drag God into it, we part company.



<p>Besides, it does seem to me that on the matter of blessings, the

Almighty spoke pretty clearly on September 11, and it wasn't a blessing

we received.



<p>The blinking, patriotic gasoline pump came after several days of

observing life on the home front in the War against Terror, all of which

brought me to single, inescapable conclusion: nearly two months on, it

is definitely time for America to get a life.



<p>I have to say that once inside the Mobil, the display of September-11th

merchandise was modest, at least compared to the Irving station a week

before which had sweats, tees, bumper stickers, little flags, and a

large selection of lapel pins. The irony at Irving was overwhelming

because, as perhaps few Americans would know, the company's founder is

an eccentric Canadian gazillionaire who lived for many years in the

Caymen Islands to avoid taxes. Echoes of Dr. Johnson on patriotism were

almost audible.



<p>Our neighbors across the street have established a ritual of emerging

from their front door twice a day to put up their flag and take it down,

closely following the flag-etiquette instructions I recall from the 1956

edition of the Boy Scouts of America Manual. They do forget sometimes,

but they are pretty regular.



<p>These home-front patriots are the same good folks who, when we were new

to the neighborhood and I politely objected to their having their

driveway snow plowed across the street into our front yard, advised me,

"You don't own the sidewalk." Then there was the time that their

vagabond cat, which it turned out had not been given shots in 6 years,

bit another neighbor. When she raised the matter of her medical costs,

their answer was, "There's no leash law for cats."



<p>I don't really know whether there is a connection between cuckoo-clock

flag etiquette and being the most obnoxious neighbors we've ever

experienced, but the ritual does set them apart from others on our

street who choose to fly flags. Most keep it casual like some wash

draped out to dry from an upstairs window or a front porch rail. Somehow

this approach seems more in keeping with the rusted car and tractor

parts that litter so many of America's yards and driveways.



<p>As I walked past the donut shop one day, right under the giant "Honk for

America!" sign was a display bristling with scores of flags. At first, I

regarded this as an unusually enthusiastic display of patriotism, but a

man standing at a table with a fistful of dollar bills quickly corrected

my first impression. I wondered whether there was a deal for a flag with

a dozen jelly donuts or maybe a half dozen, but I wasn't curious enough

to walk over and ask.



<p>My favorite patriotic sticker, often seen on the sides or backs of

highway trucks, is "Be Proud to Be an American!" Each time it rumbles

past, I think, "If only I could while peasants, who wouldn't know what

New York is, have limbs blown off by pilots at 30 thousand feet who

managed the remarkable feat of achieving 'air superiority' over a 14th

century land in record time." And there is something positively

heartwarming in being ordered to be proud.



<p>A gift shop on the New York Tollway probably set the high-water mark for

make-a-buck patriotism. About a third of the store was filled with

September-11th merchandise. The extent of the display made me wonder how

they filled the store before "The Tragedy." Dramatic, new graphics on

shirts, hats, glasses, and banners lured a steady stream of patriots

from seeking the slightly-fetid washrooms after a stop at the grease-pit

food franchises.



<p>I only thank God I don't watch television. The chaotic, fast-cut assault

of greed, patriotism, and twisted religion would be unbearable. And I'll

bet each station has an official War-against-Terror logo with some

limited-time offers for merchandise.
