Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill has run into a

bit of trouble lately by speaking his mind about

international economic policy. The responses from

Wall Street and Washington show how difficult it is to

challenge almost any prevailing economic policy-- even

when the evidence against it is overwhelming.



         <p>Last week the Secretary roiled financial markets

by stating that "we are not pursuing, as it is often said, a

policy of a strong dollar."



         <p>Now here is something that ought to be the

subject of real debate. We racked up the largest trade

deficit in the history of the United States last year. An

overvalued dollar is clearly a huge part of the problem:

it makes our imports cheaper and our exports more

expensive to foreign purchasers.



         <p>Supporters of current policy are taking

advantage of widespread economic illiteracy in order to

maintain the status quo. A "strong dollar" sure sounds

good -- isn't a weak dollar a sign of weakness?



         <p>But a strong dollar does not necessarily make

for a strong economy. When we import $370 billion

more than we export -- as we did last year -- we have to

borrow internationally to pay for it. This kind of

borrowing is a lot more serious than the kind that the

federal government did in the 1980's and early 90's,

when it ran large budget deficits. For one thing, that

was money that we borrowed mostly from ourselves.

This is a foreign debt, and those who hold it cannot be

expected to keep feeding our habit indefinitely.



         <p>Even more immediately, last year's trade deficit

cost us about 3 million manufacturing jobs in the

United States. Overall unemployment remains low,

since new jobs are created as the economy grows. But

people who lose their jobs in manufacturing still get

hurt: typically they do not find new employment at

comparable pay and benefits.



         <p>O'Neill was right to say that we would not

pursue a "strong dollar" policy, although he quickly

retracted his remarks after the dollar fell against the

euro and the yen. It is too early to say whether any

change in policy is in the works, or whether Wall Street

will continue to call the shots.



         <p>Wall Street favors a high dollar because cheaper

imports mean slightly lower inflation (which favors

bondholders); and because a high dollar makes overseas

acquisitions cheaper. The big financial interests do not

really care about the effects of a high dollar on the

domestic economy, employment, or an unsustainable

foreign debt.



         <p>The Secretary has also gotten grief for remarks

criticizing the International Monetary Fund and its

intervention to "rescue" the Russian ruble in 1998. It is

difficult to imagine a more misguided mission ending in

a more complete failure. The IMF spent billions of

dollars -- most of which went right into the hands of

speculators -- in a futile attempt to keep the overvalued

Russian currency from falling. After the ruble

collapsed, the result was not the economic disaster that

the Fund had predicted -- quite the contrary, the

Russian economy responded to the stimulus of a lower

ruble by registering its best growth in more than a

decade.



         <p>Yet the Washington Post immediately slapped

O'Neill in the head for his "unhelpful hostility to

international financial bailouts." In an editorial entitled

"Mr. O'Neill's Misfire," the Post insisted that "the IMF

does a hard job tolerably well."



         <p>Such is the sad state of debate over economic

policy in America today -- even the Treasury Secretary

can barely get a hearing to criticize the most abject

failures. This wall  of silence may prove costly in the

months to come, as the Fed will be deciding whether to

stimulate our sagging economy by lowering interest

rates -- or whether it will consider inflation (for

example due to a falling dollar) to be the greater

danger.



         <p>The Fed has still not taken back the full amount

of interest rate hikes -- begun in June of 1999 -- that

helped bring us the current slowdown. It is only natural

to wonder why not, and you can bet that the thought has

crossed Paul O'Neill's mind. As a former manufacturing

executive he does not share the bond markets' view that

economic growth should generally be sacrificed to the

fight against inflation, no matter how small or

imaginary the threat.



         <p>But don't expect the Treasury Secretary to take

on Alan Greenspan any time soon. He's in enough

trouble already without being accused of blasphemy.
