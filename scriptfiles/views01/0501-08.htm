If the world is going to permit organizations to exist for the purpose of

promoting consumer products that used as intended cause death and disease,

then it at least ought to establish meaningful restraints on how those

organizations can operate.



<p>That is the modest premise underlying an initiative by the World Health

Organization (WHO) to create a Framework Convention on Tobacco Control

(FCTC).



<p>WHO member countries unanimously agreed in 1999 to launch negotiations on

a global tobacco treaty. If adopted, the FCTC will constitute the first

treaty negotiated through the WHO. The second round of formal negotiations

over the treaty are underway this week in Geneva.



<p>WHO predicts that by 2030, 10 million people will die annually from

tobacco-related disease, with 70 percent of those deaths in developing

countries. That's a lot of blood on the hands of the Big Tobacco companies

that aggressively cultivate new smokers, manipulate their product to keep

smokers addicted and work to circumvent public health and taxation systems

that would deter smoking.



<p>The Framework Convention could make an enormous contribution to stemming

the global tobacco epidemic by fostering international cooperation on

issues such as smuggling and the global marketing of tobacco products.



<p>A proposed smuggling protocol should involve a system of tracking

cigarette exports, including labels indicating the intended final

destination. Cigarette smuggling is at epidemic levels -- an estimated one

in three internationally traded cigarettes is smuggled -- and newly

emerging evidence from company documents suggests the tobacco industry is

facilitating, encouraging or even directing smuggling on a massive scale.

Smuggling allows tobacco  companies to evade excise taxes, which in most

countries make up a considerable portion of the consumer price -- and

which deter smoking by keeping prices up.



<p>A marketing protocol should impose a worldwide ban on cigarette

advertising and marketing, or at least require countries to adopt

prohibitions on tobacco advertising to the extent permitted under their

national constitutions.



<p>But even though the tobacco control movement has effectively vilified Big

Tobacco in the last several years, the multinational companies remain

enormously powerful, and they are pursuing varied strategies to undermine

an effective international treaty.



<p>The biggest and slickest of the companies, Philip Morris, claims to have

turned over a new leaf. Philip Morris now says it supports a tobacco

treaty.



<p>"It is time for regulation," says David Greenberg, Philip Morris

International's senior vice president for corporate affairs. "The company

is ready to embrace regulation around the world whether by international

institutions and/or at the national level."



<p>"We'd like to see a convention have as broad a reach as possible,"

Greenberg says, "so we know what the rules are."



<p>Philip Morris would support treaty provisions on youth smoking prevention,

information to adult smokers, ingredient disclosure, disclosure of the

constituents of tobacco smoke, marketing standards and smuggling. The

company also supports government regulation of the tobacco product itself,

so that cigarettes can be "made as safe as they can be," Greenberg says.



<p>A "cooperative" Philip Morris may be at least as dangerous as an

obstructionist one, if it is able to influence the negotiating process and

shift the treaty away from aggressive measures. For example, Philip Morris

supports restrictions on broadcast advertising of tobacco products, bans

on the use of cartoons in cigarette ads and prohibitions on the placement

of advertisement in locations with a "particular appeal to minors" --

measures that many activists believe to be of little value, because they

can be easily circumvented and leave so many marketing opportunities open

to the tobacco pushers. Philip Morris says it strongly opposes a total

marketing ban, which has proven public health benefits.



<p>Where once the major risk in the FCTC process seemed to be that no treaty

would emerge, activists are increasingly concerned that the main danger is

that the treaty that emerges may not be worth much.



<p>"This is the week when we will find out if governments are simply making

gestures or if they have the guts to take on the tobacco industry and

really deal with the world's biggest public health epidemic," says Clive

Bates, of ASH UK. "The danger is that too many governments and the WHO

just want a treaty and any treaty will do."



<p>But any treaty will not do. A strong treaty could meaningfully assist the

heroic efforts of the understaffed tobacco control activists in developing

countries and the former Eastern bloc who are trying to stem the

preventable death toll from tobacco-related disease.



<p>"The overturning in the courts of the EU ban on tobacco advertising last

year has stopped Czech tobacco control legislation from coming to

fruition, and the tobacco industry is doing very strong and systematic

lobbying of our politicians," explains Eva Kralikova of the Czech Medical

Association. "This is why we need a strong FCTC -- as a defense against

back-sliding in the West and to help us get tough national tobacco control

policies implemented as soon as possible."



<p>By contrast, a weak treaty will enable the tobacco predators to continue

unimpeded in their determined efforts to spread death and disease, with

horrific consequences in the countries least well equipped to protect the

public health from Big Tobacco's organized onslaught.
