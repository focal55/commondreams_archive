THE BLUE-GREEN alliance between labor and environmentalists frayed badly over the vote in Congress last month to authorize drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Thirty-six Democrats voted for the Bush administration initiative, many on the strength of lobbying by the Teamsters and other union officials who said it would create 750,000 jobs. Now a new report by an economist with strong ties to labor debunks that figure. It should help redirect the national debate toward the common goal of developing permanent jobs that do not despoil a pristine wilderness.
<P>

<p>The study the Teamsters used to back their claims was commissioned in 1990 by the American Petroleum Institute. It projected jobs created not just by the drilling itself, but by the ripple effect throughout the whole economy of falling energy prices presumably achieved through new supplies of oil uncovered at  the Arctic refuge.  But the study overestimated the amount the oil would represent on the world market, according to Dean Baker of the Center for Economic and Policy Research.<P>



<p>Using current estimates from the Energy Information Agency, Baker found that the earlier study overstated the size of the potential oil flows by a factor of three. Even with the multiplier effect, Baker estimates that only 46,300 new jobs could  be attributed to opening the refuge to drilling.<P>



<p>Another flaw with the Petroleum Institute's report is that it assumed none of the other oil-producing nations would take action to prop up fuel prices, counteracting much of the projected benefit to the American economy. Historically, OPEC's behavior in the face of oil gluts hardly supports the theory that those nations would sit idly by.  <P>



<p>Third, even the original study admitted that the jobs created would be temporary. Peak production is expected to last less than 10 years, after which the benefit to the economy would taper off dramatically. <P>



<p>Taken together, these flawed assumptions undermine the argument that swayed some House Democrats to support drilling. As the Senate prepares to vote on the matter this fall - Energy Committee hearings begin next week - members should stick to more recent and defensible analyses. <P>



<p>It is important to remember, for example, that jobs created in clean energy technologies produce multiplier effects throughout the economy, too. The Department of Energy has estimated that investments in renewable energy research could create a $3 billion export market by 2010, creating 100,000 jobs. <P>



<p>Senator Edward Kennedy, who opposes drilling in the Arctic refuge, is the strongest friend labor has in Washington. In the coming weeks his leadership will be needed to show that jobs can be compatible with a sustainable environment and a safe, clean, affordable energy supply. <P>
