Who said that the level of civilisation in any society should be judged by how it treated its weakest members, such as those left forgotten in prison? What government declared that prison was "an expensive way to make bad people worse"? 

<P>These are not the words of do-gooding, woolly liberal Guardian readers who care more about the rights of criminals than victims. The first was said by Winston Churchill, then home secretary, calling for parliament to respond to the need for prison reforms. Crucially, he urged that we never give up hope on the capacity of the human heart to change.  

<P>The second comes from a white paper published by another Conservative home secretary, David Waddington, in 1990 under Margaret Thatcher. The prison population fell under those Tories, from over 50,000 to 40,000. The subsequent Criminal Justice Act of 1991 ordered sentencers to use prison as "a last resort", and to give reasons why it was necessary for "serious offences". But that required judges, magistrates, and ministers to face up to the primordial British love of punishment - so vividly expressed daily in our tabloids. And from Kenneth Clarke onwards, they flunked it. As a result, our prisons are now overflowing with half again as many people as only a decade ago. By 2005, the population may have doubled to 90,000.  

<P>And these are "our" prisons. People are sent to fester behind bars in such numbers using our precious taxes, for our protection and in an attempt to win our votes. When we read the immensely sad stories in this newspaper during the past week, or hear the savage indictment of Brixton prison conditions by Gen Sir David Ramsbotham, Her Majesty's inspector, we cannot merely shake our heads and move on to worrying about where we will take our children skiing at half term.  

<P>The vast majority of the people now behind bars will be emerging in due course. If they have TB, we will breathe their germs on tubes and buses. If they are mentally ill, they will become our problem soon enough. If they are untrained and unemployable, it is our houses and cars they will be ransacking for saleable goods. If they go in for modest offences, and emerge angrier and better skilled both at heavier crimes and avoiding detection, prison will not have "worked" for the rest of us.  

<P>Moreover as Emrys James and David Wilson both pointed out, these people are not a sub-race, but people like us, with the same complex feelings, the same urges, vices, restlessness and dreams. Research shows that offending is widespread   among all social classes, especially among teenagers and young adults. The difference is who gets caught.  

<P>The appalling vista laid out in the Guardian's investigation is so bleak it is tempting to believe nothing can be done. But the experience of Grendon is inspiring: the 40 years it took to build a second one tells us more about our love of punishment than our concern for redemption and community safety.  

<P>Restorative justice operates in the wing communities in Grendon in ways that could change the whole culture of the prison service: complaints and discipline, bullying and many other grievances that now add to the sense of injustice both from inmates and staff would be far better settled through mediation, in which both parties can feel involved. Moreover, mediation and reparation with their victims brings home to offenders the real consequences of their actions while prison makes them feel victimised.  

<P>If the government is committed to "what works" as its guide for criminal justice   policy and crime reduction, then it must bite the bullet and face down public ignorance and vindictiveness which now places prison as the main option, and all else as an alternative to prison. It should again be a last resort.  

<P>Safety does require some people to be locked up. Prison can lead damaged people to reconsider their lives and learn new skills, take new options. The arts in prison are especially effective both as tools for expression beyond violence and as a route to education and social skills. They too suffer from lack of staff and resources.  

<P>But to work effectively with those who need to be incarcerated, the prison service must be freed from the disastrous burden of those who could be dealt with effectively and far less expensively in the community.  

<P>Moreover, for the vast majority of inmates, the loss of local connections with family, job and home sentences them again to return to crime. Is that really why we are spending so much in scarce financial and human resources, and destroying so many families in the process - to increase future crime? The real scandal of prison is that by Churchill's test we are uncivilised. Shame on all of us.
