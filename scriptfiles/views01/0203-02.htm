It is just after 9 a.m. -- still painfully early for most

university students -- and about 30 students are crowded around our

guest speaker after class, craning their necks to see his photographs

of the poorest of India's poor at work. They have just listened to

him talk for an hour, and they won't let him leave, peppering him

with questions about the people in the photos.

<P>The scene is at odds with what one often hears about today's

college students -- that they all are apathetic, self-interested

career-seekers who have no concern about the rest of the world and no

interest in social justice.</P>



<P>That is certainly true of some -- perhaps even the majority -- but

it is not an intrinsic state of being of today's youth. My students'

reaction to the visiting Indian journalist, P. Sainath, and his

compelling work on social and economic justice reminded me that young

people are waiting for something from their elders, and that too

often we don't provide it.</P>



<P>What they don't want or need are pious lectures, stories of the

good old days, or marching orders, nor do they need heroes. After a

decade of university teaching, I think what young people are looking

for are role models -- not just one model, but different models to

help them find their own place in a complex world where it is

difficult to be a decent person. They don't need people to worship,

but people to learn with.</P>



<P>That is what Sainath offered. He walked into my large class in a

big, ugly lecture hall at 8 a.m. and grabbed their attention, but not

by preaching at them. He simply told the story of how he walked away

from a career as a high-ranking, well-paid editor in Indian

newspapers to become an under-paid freelance writer covering the poor

-- and the social, political and economic systems that keep them

poor.</P>



<P>"As the Indian media, much like the US media, concentrated more

and more of their coverage on the lives of the top 5% -- the rich and

the beautiful people -- I decided I would cover the bottom 5%, to

tell their stories that are almost never heard," Sainath said.</P>



<P>Sainath's work has garnered awards -- most recently Amnesty

International's Global Award for Human Rights Journalism -- and his

book Everybody Loves a Good Drought has sold well around the world.

But my students were fascinated not just by the results of his

reporting but by his passion for people and justice.</P>



<P>In a world that spends more time glorifying the few who are rich

than asking why so many are hungry, Sainath's commitment to reporting

on the poor -- and to asking critical questions about why they are

poor -- may seem out of step. In the world of dot-com billionaires,

who cares about poor people half a world away?</P>



<P>My students came to care that morning, because they saw someone

else care, and care deeply enough to act.</P>



<P>Sainath is not falsely modest; like most journalists, he's proud

of his work and eager to have it read widely. But his work in India's

poorest districts gives him a sense of perspective that we so often

lack in the United States. He said that people always ask him how he

deals with the suffering he sees in these districts, expecting him to

be depressed by it.</P>



<P>"What I feel when I return from those villages is a sense of hope

after seeing how strong and resilient human beings can be," he said.

"I ask myself if I would have that kind of courage in the face of

such conditions. I'm not sure I would."</P>



<P>Whatever Sainath's level of courage, he brought to my students a

relentless honesty about how the power wielded by corporations and

their elite partners in government -- in the United States and around

the world -- hurts people. He also gave them a model for how one can

face that power, which can look so overwhelming and unstoppable.

There is courage in his work, and my students could see it. And just

as Sainath returns from poor villages with hope, I think most of my

students left that class with a new sense of hope.</P>



<P>And I left with the reminder that if at the end of a semester most

of my students are cynical or apathetic, I should blame myself not

them. If we are to expect more from our young people than the greed

and indifference to the suffering of others that they see all around

them -- including in the university -- we must start by expecting

more of ourselves.</P>
