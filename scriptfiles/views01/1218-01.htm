We have a Christmas economy.  We have a military economy.  No wonder

it's hard for people around the world to figure America out.  Christmas

in the best of times has a split personality.  There is a religious

Christmas and a secular Xmas.  The material side tends to drown out the

spiritual.  This year the political is upstaging, and incorporating,

both of them.

<p>The national psyche is shell-shocked.  Even with the highest murder

rate among fellow nations and being the largest arms dealer in the

world, Americans are stunned by the blowback of September 11, actual

attacks on their home ground, on the scale of special effects in

movies.  Decorative lights are red, white, and blue, in memoriam to the

dead, in support of America's war on terrorists.

<p>Osama bin Laden and his band of men, mass murderers for their cause,

have thrown the season out of whack.  A few dozen men in one branch of

one religion killed thousands of people of many religions and

nationalities.  They want Americans, men and women of many faiths living

and working together--and therefore infidels in their scheme of

things--out of Saudi Arabia.  They want the world to follow their

script, their reading of scripture.  They will go to any lengths, to the

ends of the earth and back, to achieve their purpose.  We are reminded

that history is geography is destiny.  

<p>Compare the two main figures of the season.  Father Christmas or St.

Nicholas or Sinter Klaas or Santa Claus is an older man from the Arctic

Circle, part pagan, part Christian, who rides a horse or a sleigh pulled

by reindeer and carries big bags of presents.  Jesus is a Jew from

Bethlehem, a younger man who has few possessions.  

<p>Both of them are legendary philanthropists; they emanate love for

people, each in his own way.  In the case of Santa, love is shown by

bestowing gifts.  In the case of Jesus, love is its own reward, a

spiritual gift.  This creates a certain tension about life on the

worldly plane, between the claims of the Kingdom of God and human

nature.

<p>This year it's a schism, a crisis.  There is a revival of 

existentialism and of religious expression.  Not all Americans celebrate

Christmas.  There are more Americans who are not Christians than there

are African-Americans or Hispanics.  You could call them the country's

largest minority.  Those who are not adherents of Christianity are

caught up in the seasonal momentum, which continues from Thanksgiving

until trees shed their needles and are discarded.  The Christmas

experience, centered around Christmas Eve, may last for two months. 

Many stores do almost half their year's business geared to Christmas and

other businesses function exclusively for Christmas. 

<p>This year we are more aware than usual of the tens of millions of

American Hindus, Sikhs, Muslims, Jews, Buddhists, Baha'is, secular

humanists, and those who follow or don't follow other beliefs.  We are

more aware than usual that America is a pluralist society where more

than one-seventh of the population do not observe the birthday of

Jesus.  There is added reason to give different perspectives some room

to breathe amid the crowd of Christmas activities and symbols.  We want

to see a government for Afghanistan that reflects its multiethnic

population, women as much as men.  We want them to be as free as we are.

<p>Christmas assimilated Saturnalia and winter solstice observances to

honor the figure revered as the prince of peace.  Christians give gifts,

primarily to children, as a proxy for giving birthday gifts to baby

Jesus.  

<p>"The Christmas season" generally refers to marketing and sales

campaigns for people to buy more than they need as much as to a time of

prayer.  But the two become merged.  It is a religious and political act

to be a consumer.  Christmas carols play in stores and restaurants.  The

political prayer is an American ritual, in Congress, in the pledge of

allegiance to the flag, at public events.  This challenges both

democracy and spiritual practice, the Constitution and the Christian

Bible. 

<p>Most American children do not need any extra things.  They have

enough.  They have been indoctrinated to want more things but they don't

need them.  For the most part, they have more things than anyone else,

more than they know what to do with.  What children need is love,

support, guidance, nurturing, play, kindness, a good education, and,

when in doubt, more of the same.  They need physical security, food,

health, shelter, clothing, air and water and sunlight.      

<p>A patriotic Christmas becomes a fusion of church and state.  It toys

with the First Amendment.  It Christianizes America and politicizes

Christian religiosity.  It confuses the issues.  Jesus is usually

performed in movies by northern European Christians who will look more

like Santa Claus when they get old, not by what we think of as young

"Middle Eastern" or "Mediterranean" men.  As with the protean Santa

Claus, combined from many cultural traditions, Jesus takes on the local

trappings of believers.  This year, more than ever, the baby Jesus seems

to be swaddled in the American flag while Santa seems to be choking on

his laugh.
