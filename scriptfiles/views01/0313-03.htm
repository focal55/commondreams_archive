Like spooks from an abandoned B-Movie graveyard, officials of the 

              Reagan-Bush era are emerging from the dirt and showing up inside 

              the George W. Bush administration. The latest resurrection is John 

              Negroponte, whom Bush recently nominated as ambassador to the United 

              Nations.

<p>As U.S. ambassador to Honduras from 1981 to 1985, Negroponte abetted 

              and covered up human rights crimes. He was a zealous anti-Communist 

              crusader in America's covert wars against the leftist Sandinista 

              government in Nicaragua and the FMLN rebels in El Salvador. The 

              high-level planning, money and arms for those wars flowed from Washington, 

              but much of the on-the-ground logistics for the deployment of intelligence, 

              arms and soldiers was run out of Honduras. U.S. military aid to 

              Honduras jumped from $3.9 million in 1980 to $77.4 million by 1984. 

              So crammed was the tiny country with U.S. bases and weapons that 

              it was dubbed the <i>USS Honduras,</i> as if it were simply an off-shore 

              staging ground. </p>

<p>The captain of this ship, Negroponte was in charge of the U.S. 

              Embassy when, 



            according to a 1995 four-part series in the <i>Baltimore Sun,</i> 

            hundreds of Hondurans were kidnapped, tortured and killed by Battalion 

            316, a secret army intelligence unit trained and supported by the 

            Central Intelligence Agency. As Gary Cohn and Ginger Thompson wrote 

            in the series, Battalion 316 used "shock and suffocation devices in 

            interrogations. Prisoners often were kept naked and, when no longer 

            useful, killed and buried in unmarked graves." Members of Battalion 

            316 were trained in surveillance and interrogation at a secret location 

            in the United States and by the CIA at bases in Honduras. Gen. Gustavo 

            Alvarez Martinez, the chief of the Honduran armed forces who personally 

            directed Battalion 316, also trained in the United States at the School 

            of the Americas. 

            

<p>Negroponte tried to distance himself from the pattern of abuses, 

              even after a flood of declassified documents exposed the extent 

              of U.S. involvement with Battalion 316. In a segment of the 1998 

              CNN mini-series <i>Cold War,</i> Negroponte said that "some of the 

              retrospective effort to try and suggest that we were supportive 

              of, or condoned the actions of, human rights violators is really 

              revisionistic." </p>

<p>By the time Negroponte was appointed ambassador by President Reagan 

              in 1981, human rights activists in Honduras were vocally denouncing 

              abuses. Former Honduran congressman Efrain Diaz Arrivillaga pleaded 

              with Negroponte and other U.S. officials to stop the abuses committed 

              by the U.S.-controlled military. "Their attitude was one of tolerance 

              and silence," Diaz told the <i>Sun.</i> "They needed Honduras to 

              loan its territory more than they were concerned about innocent 

              people being killed." </p>

<p>Negroponte ignored such protests, and annually filed State Department 

              reports from Honduras that gave the impression that the Honduran 



              military respected human rights. But in an interview with <i>In 

              These Times,</i> Negroponte's predecessor as ambassador, Carter 

              appointee Jack Binns, tells a different story: "Negroponte would 

              have had to be deliberately blind not to know about human rights 

              violations. ... One of the things a departing ambassador does is 

              prepare a briefing book, and one of those issues we included [in 

              our briefing book] was how to deal with the escalation of human 

              rights issues." </p>

<p>Binns considered the U.S. support for Alvarez and Battalion 316 

              "counterproductive" to the declared objective of "establishing a 

              rule of law." This lack of enthusiasm, Binns says, led to "my being 

              cut out of the loop" by the Reagan administration, which he served 

              for several months before Negroponte took over. In the summer of 

              1981, Binns recalls, "I was called unexpectedly to Washington by 

              Tom Enders, the assistant secretary of state. He asked me to stop 

              reporting human rights violations through official State Department 

              channels and to use back channels because they were afraid of leaks." 

            </p>

<p>As Binns explains, back-channel messages "don't officially exist. 

              The message is translated over CIA channels, decrypted and hand-carried 

              from Langley, one copy only. No record." </p>

<p>Binns did not agree to use back channels and when he returned to 

              Honduras, he received no further reports of human rights violations 

              from the CIA. "I was deliberately lied to," says Binns, who later 

              found out that Reagan administration had been working behind his 

              back. </p>

<p>Honduras was only one of many hot spots where Negroponte served. 

              He spent four years as a political officer in the U.S. Embassy in 

              Saigon during the height of the Vietnam War. As an aide to then 

              National Security Adviser Henry Kissinger at the Paris Peace Talks, 

              he fell out of favor with his boss, wrote Mark Matthews in a 1997 

              article in the <i>Sun,</i> "by arguing that the chief U.S. negotiator 

              was making too many concessions to the North Vietnamese." Negroponte 

              also served in the Philippines, Panama and Mexico, where he was 

              a strong booster for NAFTA. </p>

<p>Rumored to have been Colin Powell's pick for the job of U.N. ambassador, 

              Negroponte has a reputation as a loyal bureaucrat and efficient 

              fixer. He also has a Cold War mentality characteristic of many of 

              the old Reagan-Bush people surrounding the new president. </p>

<p>The lessons Negroponte has learned from the past may shed light 

              on what kind of U.N. ambassador he will be if his nomination is 

              approved by the Senate. When he appeared in 1981 before a Senate 

              committee for confirmation as envoy to Honduras, he said, "I believe 

              we must do our best not to allow the tragic outcome of Indochina 

              to be repeated in Central America." </p>

<p>The tragedy to which he referred, of course, was the defeat of 

              the United States, not the devastation and death caused by U.S. 

              intervention.
