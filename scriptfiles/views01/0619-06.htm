Some African-American leaders are urging the Bush administration to declare

the HIV/AIDS epidemic a national state of emergency and provide federal funds

for more effective treatment and prevention programs. But the state of denial

is the primary reason the epidemic has wreaked havoc within the black

community; the virus has replaced murder as the leading killer of black men

and women ages 25 to 44.

<P>

   These black leaders, organized by the National Black Leadership Commission

on AIDS, made their appeal in the wake of a June 1 report by the Atlanta-based

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The report details exploding rates

of infection within the black community, especially among black gay men.

Released on the 20th anniversary of the discovery of the disease, the report

found that HIV is spreading among gay men in general but that the infection

rate among blacks was nearly fivetimes as high as the rate of Hispanics and

whites combined.

<P>



The report estimated that more than 30 percent of black men between the

ages of 23 and 29 "who have sex with men" are HIV positive. The survey,

conducted between 1998-2000, found that almost 15 percent of these men were

newly infected with the disease. The infection rates among blacks are "similar

to those we saw in the beginning of the epidemic during some of the peak

years," said Dr. Helene Gayle, director of the CDC's center for HIV, sexually

transmitted diseases and tuberculosis prevention. According to the center,

more than half of the 40,000 new infections last year were among

African-Americans. And black women are four times more likely to carry the

virus than their white counterparts.

<P>

   More than half of AIDS cases among black men now occur among those who have

sex with other men, up from 31 percent in 1989, when IV drug use was the

primary mode of transmission. Fewer than 10 percent of the AIDS cases among

black men result from heterosexual sex, compared with 38 percent among women.

<P>

   While black leaders should stress the need to eliminate racial disparities

in the funding of treatment and prevention programs, they must be equally

vigorous in attacking the denial that fertilizes the growth of the deadly

virus. This denial emerges from a number of complex elements, including

poverty, ignorance, distrust and fear.

<P>

   But perhaps the core of the denial is the African-American community's

conception of masculinity. The legacy of oppression and a history of cultural

stereotypes have placed a particular emphasis on notions of masculinity for

black men. Because of that, many African-Americans consider the words

homosexuality and "blackness" mutually exclusive.

<P>

   Feminist cultural critic bell hooks (she chooses not to capitalize the b or

h) argues that this conflict between gayness and black machismo encourages

homophobia within the black community and goes back to the Black Power

movement, which identified homosexuality as something weak and compliant and

inspired by Europeans. The hard-core masculinity of hip-hop culture has

reinforced those notions. What's more, African-American men historically have

been denied access to the social establishment--and often have gained entrance

based on physical demonstrations of strength or virility. Thus, machismo has

always been a strong component of black masculinity. Thus, many black men who

have sex with other men don't consider themselves gay.

<P>

   "The concept of being gay is seen as the antithesis of manhood," explains

Cornelius Baker, former head of the National Association of People with AIDS.

<P>

   Many analysts believe this denial is one of the primary reasons for the

increase in infection rates among gay men and black women. Experts in the

field have dubbed this tendency the Down Low syndrome when men have sex with

other men but deny they are gay or even bisexual. (This syndrome makes their

girlfriends or wives more vulnerable to infection. Black women are two-thirds

of all women with AIDS.)

<P>

   Experts are not sure of the numbers of black men afflicted with the DL

syndrome, but there have been hints in government surveys. One CDC survey

found that of 8,780 HIV-positive men who have sex with men, 24 percent of the

black men identified themselves as heterosexual, compared with 6 percent of

whites.

<P>

   Ironies abound in this fight against HIV/AIDS. Many Americans think of

HIV/AIDS as a disease unleashed as divine retribution for the "sinful"

behavior associated with its transmission. But those who see HIV/AIDS as God's

punishment also see more sexual candor than before the age of AIDS.

<P>

   So instead of acting as God's vengeful messenger, the virus has been the

catalyst to open society to sexual messages previously considered taboo. The

African-American concept of macho masculinity was born of the need to project

black men as protectors and defenders. Instead, it is serving as bridge for a

virus of destruction. That is a tragic irony born in the state of denial.
