America' 42nd President, William Jefferson

Clinton, is likely to be remembered for the longest-

running business cycle expansion in American history,

which coincided with his two terms.



         

<p>A fair assessment of his legacy should therefore

begin by asking what, if anything, the President had to

do with the economic growth of the last nine and a half

years. The answer is: well, nothing really.



         

<p>It is often maintained, by people who have not

looked at the economics, that balancing the federal

budget and moving it to surplus were responsible for

the economic boom that followed.



         

<p>But there is no foundation for this claim. The

underlying theory is that these budget changes lead to

lower long-term interest rates, because the government

is borrowing less. The lower interest rates then

stimulate more investment and therefore growth.



         

<p>Even if one accepts the theory-- which is quite a

stretch-- the facts don't fit the case. This was not an

investment-led upswing. And the effects of the post-

1992 budget changes on interest rates are much too

small to have had any noticeable positive impact on

growth, according to any standard model used by

economists.



         

<p>How then to explain the boom? While any

business cycle expansion has multiple causes, two stand

out here. The first, and most important, was a change in

policy at the Federal Reserve about five and a half years

ago. The Fed, which had previously operated under the

theory that six percent unemployment was the best that

the economy could do without accelerating inflation,

abandoned that view. Unemployment was allowed to

fall to its current 4 percent, and growth continued

beyond the point at which the Fed, in the past, would

have pulled the plug.



         

<p>The second was the stock market bubble: a 14

trillion increase in stock holdings over the last decade

caused many upper income households to spend freely.

This spending, even if it was based on paper increases

in wealth that are now disappearing, provided a

considerable stimulus to the economy-- much the same

as we would get from a large increase in deficit

spending by the federal government.



         

<p>Mr. Clinton cannot claim credit for the stock

market bubble, nor would he necessarily want to. Nor

did he have anything to do with the Fed's policy shift,

which was probably the most important positive change

in economic policy in the last 20 years.



         

<p>The economic policies for which the President

can honestly claim responsibility-- e.g., NAFTA, the

creation and expansion of the World Trade

Organization-- served primarily to prevent the majority

of Americans from sharing in the gains from economic

growth. And then there was welfare reform, which

threw millions of poor single mothers at the mercy of

one of the lowest-wage labor markets in the

industrialized world.



         

<p>In short, Clinton's policies continued the upward

redistribution of income and wealth, and punishment

for the poor, that were the hallmarks of the Reagan era.

It was not until 1999 that the median real wage reached

its pre-1990 level, and it remains anchored today at

about where it was 27 years ago.



         

<p>Clinton's foreign economic policy was similar,

although more devastating. His administration, together

with its allies at the IMF and the World Bank, presided

over the destruction of the Russian economy, helped to

cause and worsen the Asian economic crisis, and

squeezed billions in debt service from the poorest

countries in Africa. Not to mention racking up a record,

economically unsustainable trade deficit for the United

States.



         

<p>Clinton's legacy is by no means an academic

question. If the economy fares badly over the next few

years, the Clinton era will look quite good by

comparison. The "New Democrat" strategy of

abandoning core constituencies-- especially working

Americans-- in favor of big business and the rich will

be judged an economic and political success.



         

<p>In reality it was neither: Clinton's fight for

NAFTA cost his party the House in 1994, and the New

Democrats' long-term strategy to win back the South

could hardly have failed more miserably: Gore did not

carry a single Southern state, not even his home state of

Tennessee. So long as Democrats continue to offer the

average American nothing to improve his or her

economic situation, many voters-- and not only in the

South-- will continue to vote against them on the basis

of issues that are irrelevant to their economic well-

being.



         

<p>George W. Bush may well hand the White

House back to the Democrats in 2004, if his extremist

cabinet nominations are any indication of his political

judgment. But if Bush's successor is to do any good for

America or the world, we will first need an honest

evaluation of the Clinton years.
