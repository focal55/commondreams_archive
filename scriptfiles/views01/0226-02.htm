<i>Dear Sir Elton John, I know you'll be getting a lot of mail, so I'll keep this brief: YOU GO GIRL! With great respect, a fan</i> 

<P>

I imagine that the words of support I sent the morning after the Grammy Awards weren't what the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD) had in mind when they posted Elton John's address on their web site and suggested their members write to him regarding his performance with rapper Eminem. 

<P>

"GLAAD is appalled that John would share a stage with Eminem, whose words and actions promote hate and violence against gays and lesbians," read a statement from the group. 

<P>

The statement goes on to say that John's performance "violates the spirit" of an award he was given last year for his "outstanding contributions to combating homophobia." 

<P>

As a gay woman who considers promoting tolerance to be part of her life's work, I say, (baloney). 

<P>

Not only should Elton John keep his award for combating homophobia, he should get a few more. He deserves one for showing true tolerance, one for self-expression (Doll, that screaming yellow-and-pink polka-dotted number you wore was beyond fabulous) and one for defending the First Amendment. 

<P>

Eminem's and John's music couldn't be more different  &#151;  but isn't that the point? Besides the real power of the moment was in the two of them being on the stage together. And that hug! Now <i>that </i>was music to my eyes. 

<P>

Okay, so Elton went for the full-on body hug, while Eminem opted for less contact with more of an A-frame/just hugging the shoulders deal  &#151;  but it was a hug. And then the crowning moment, when they clasped hands and raised them above their heads, like they were both winners after a long bout. 

<P>

There was a prize won Grammy night, and I'm not talking about those little gold phonograph dealies. It's a prize everyone who watched that duet gained  &#151;  some tolerance. 

<P>

In an MTV interview last summer, Eminem said he didn't have any gay friends. Studies show that those who know someone who is gay are significantly more tolerant and understanding of gay issues than those who don't. 

<P>

Now, I don't see Eminem and Elton sharing earrings or becoming "homies," but the rapper can no longer say he doesn't know anyone who is gay. 

<P>

It's through relationships, however distant or brief, that minds are changed. That one hug advanced the cause of tolerance infinitely farther than all the picket signs and protestors outside. 

<P>

I'm not saying there aren't things about Eminem's lyrics worthy of protest. But the same right that protects protesting those lyric protects the lyrics themselves. 

<P>

Art pushes the envelope beyond where many of us want to go. Steely Dan's "Two Against Nature" album, which beat out Eminem's "Marshall Mathers LP" for album of the year, has songs presenting the first-person worldview of a pedophile and a comic account of a man lusting after his teenage cousin. 

<P>

If we're going to look at lyrics, there's one from Eminem we should consider before all others: "Half the s*** I say/I just make it up to make you mad." 

<P>

Make people mad, which in turn draws attention to the rapper and his music. 

<P>

By bringing Eminem's controversial lyrics to the public's attention, GLAAD is defeating its own purpose and promoting his. 

<P>

GLAAD built an even <i>higher </i>profile platform for Eminem with picket signs. A few protesters (neutral news sources say the picketers were far outnumbered by the media) put Eminem and his message into the spotlight. 

<P>

Before the controversy, most post-pubescent people's associations with Eminem were limited. Personally it took me awhile to figure out my college students were talking about a rapper and not a candy that melts in your mouth and not your hand. 

<P>

Post-pubescent people should know what pre-pubescent kids are listening to. Before Tipper Gore emerges from retirement to start labeling records again, let me clarify: Adults should know what kids are listening to, not so they keep them from the issues raised, but so they can talk to them about those issues. 

<P>

If Tipper were to check in with her journalism professor husband, he should tell her that the First Amendment protects <i>all</i> speech, even the speech we hate. 

<P>

"The glory of the First Amendment is its implications of tolerance, in acceptance of contradictory and even outrageous views, so that citizens may hear them all and decide for themselves," writes Jean Otto in "The First Amendment Book "The answer to speech or writing that we hate is not to ban it, but to refute it." 

<P>

By appearing on that stage with Eminem, Elton John refuted hate with love. 

<P>

Now that's outstanding, award-worthy work toward combating homophobia.
