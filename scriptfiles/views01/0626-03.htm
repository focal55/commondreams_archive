In the 20 years since the world first heard of AIDS, the epidemic has spread to every corner of the globe. It has killed almost 22 million people. It has left 13 million children orphaned.

<P>Today, more than 36 million people are living with HIV/AIDS. Last year alone, more than five million people were infected. Every day another 15,000 people acquire the virus.</P>

<P>In some African countries, HIV/AIDS has set back development by a decade or more. And now it is spreading with frightening speed in Eastern Europe, in Asia and in the Caribbean.</P>

<P>Up to now, the world's response has not measured up to the challenge. But this year, the world has started to wake up.</P>

<P>We have seen it in the media and public opinion -- led by doctors and social workers, by activists and economists, by people living with the disease.</P>

<P>We have seen it among governments. We have seen it in the private sector.</P>

<P>Never, since this nightmare began, has there been such a moment of common purpose. Never have we felt such a need to combine leadership, partnership, and solidarity.</P>

<P>Leadership must come at the international level where the entire United Nations system is at work.</P>

<P>Partnerships must come among governments, private companies, foundations, international organizations and, of course, civil society. Non-governmental organizations have been at the forefront of the fight against AIDS from the very start. All of us must learn from their experience, and follow their example.</P>

<P>Finally, solidarity must come between the healthy and the sick, among richer and poorer nations. Spending on the battle against AIDS in the developing world needs to rise to roughly five times its present level. The developing countries are ready to provide their share -- as African leaders pledged at the Abuja summit. But they cannot do it alone.</P>

<P>Ordinary people in developed countries are now showing that they understand this. I urge their leaders to act accordingly.</P>

<P>We must mobilize the money required for this exceptional effort -- and we must make sure it is used effectively. That is why I have called for a Global AIDS and Health Fund, open to both governments and private donors, to help us finance the comprehensive, coherent, co-ordinated strategy we need.</P>

<P>Our goal is to make the fund operational by the end of this year. I will continue to work with all the stakeholders to ensure that we meet that goal.</P>

<P>When we urge others to change their behaviour, so as to protect themselves against infection, we must be ready to change our own behaviour in the public arena. We cannot deal with AIDS by making moral judgments, or refusing to face unpleasant facts -- and still less by stigmatizing those who are infected, and making out that it is all their fault.</P>

<P>We can only do it by speaking clearly and openly, both about the ways that people become infected, and about what they can do to avoid infection.</P>

<P>And let us remember that every person who is infected -- whatever the reason -- is a fellow human being, with human rights and human needs. Let no one imagine that we can protect ourselves by building barriers between us and them. In the ruthless world of AIDS, there is no us and them.</P>

<P>To do all this, we must change -- if not for our own sake, then for our children's. 

<p>
