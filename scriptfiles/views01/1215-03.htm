The phrase, 'Just War,' used in reference to the battle being waged in

Afghanistan, is beginning to resonate. Not as a deep philosophical concept,

but  like the names of those specialty stores you find in shopping malls:

'Just Lamps,' 'Just Bulbs,' and 'Just Paper.' In fact, 'Just War' turns out

to be an eerily accurate marquee for the little shop known as The United

States of America. War, to the increasing exclusion of everything else, is

the only thing that America collectively cares about anymore.

<p>We don't manufacture much of anything; just war. We don't concern

ourselves with education; just war. We don't attend to the 40 million

Americans without health coverage; just war. We don't focus on the 30

million American children living in poverty; just war. We don't support the

arts; just war. Even though a a multitude of human needs were in existence

prior to September 11, and have only increased since then, we continue to

direct our attention and our resources into what we do best: war. Just war.

<p>Need a billion dollars a day for the military? No problem. Need an extra

$40 billion for the war on terrorism? Here it is. Need a blank check to

pursue an undeclared struggle with unexplained means and undefined ends? You

got it, because that's what America is all about: just war. America is the

world's biggest supplier of conventional weapons. America is the world's

biggest supplier of torture devices. America manufactures and exports

terrorists at its School of the Americas (now the Western Hemisphere

Institute for Security Cooperation). America exports violent entertainment

around the globe. Prison construction remains one of our top industries.

Global slavery is the secret behind our economic success. The military

remains our biggest budget item. Whether it's war on people of color

overseas, or war on our rights at home, that's what we're all about: just

war. 

<p>And we've now codified that reality. President Bush's guarantee of 'a

long, long struggle,' absent a measurable goal, and without a quantifiable

conclusion, suggests that America will be in a permanent militarized state

until the end of our days, forever erasing the distinction between 'war

time' and 'peace time.' There was an era when wars were ugly spectacles,

dreaded from a distance, entered reluctantly, and ended as swiftly as

possible. There were victory parades and celebrations, and a return to 'life

as we knew it.' There was a 'peace dividend'--the billions of dollars no

longer needed for war could finally be used for the benefit of public

health, welfare and the arts.

<p>But no longer. With no legal declaration of war, there can be no

cessation of hostilities. With no nations from which to demand surrender,

there will be no surrender ceremonies. In the absence of negotiations, there

will be no realignments, treaties or agreements. Terrorists, whoever they

are, wherever they are, will be rounded up in secret, tried in secret, and

executed by secret tribunals. The waging of war will become a

regularly-occurring municipal function, like trash collection or street

cleaning--all the while draining money out of our schools and hospitals,

food out of our children's mouths, and peace and beauty out of the rest of

our lives. 

<p>There is a moral corruption that comes from living in a militarized

society. When military demands continually defy debate, hold center stage at

the expense of monumental human need at home, and consume resources

essential for the well-being of people, our culture is diminished, and we

are diminished along with it. Our national dialogue becomes a monologue. And

our interactions become brutal and coarse.

<p>It's a corruption evident in Congressional disregard for the needs of

laid-off workers and Americans without health coverage. In the Attorney

General's contempt for the civil rights and freedoms he purports to defend.

In the continuing debasement of our language into 'war is peace'

doublespeak. And in the creeping fascism of pundits who define those opposed

to the war as 'irrelevant,' academics teaching history as 'un-American,' and

anyone calling for alternatives as 'lending aid and comfort to the enemy.'

<p>It's a corruption that extends to our high schools, where kids can visit

ROTC recruiters on campus--whose presence, more and more, is a condition of

receiving state funds for education. It's a corruption that extends to our

colleges--where, we are told, kids are flocking to CIA recruiters in droves,

perhaps as the result of watching the new crop of network TV dramas which

employ official CIA script consultants.

<p>And it's a corruption that extends to our smallest kids. Enlisted by a

president who spends billions of dollars on a military campaign that

destroys the homes and lives of Afghan children, American children have been

asked to send money to clean up the wreckage of his dirty war. Here's a

better idea: don't bomb civilians (by one estimate now numbering 3,500 dead)

in the first place. Use the money to build and stabilize rather than to bomb

and terrorize. And teach our kids from their earliest days that they--and

their money--have value beyond supporting the war effort.

<p>The corruption extends across the breadth of increasingly harsh American

mass cultural offerings, where you can take your pick of cop chases,

spectacular crashes, or real-life fights caught on tape. If you're tired of

watching crimes being committed, you can choose from a gaggle of court

shows, where a judge of your gender and racial preference will verbally

terrorize pairs of arguing litigants. You can get all the blood and gore you

could possibly want on the local news--just don't ask the folks at the

network to report how many civilians have actually been killed in

Afghanistan. Apparently, that information could have a negative effect on

the war. And war is, after all, what we're all about. Just war.

<p>With no end to the struggle in sight, no perceivable opposition party in

Washington, and no balancing voices of reason being given the light of day

by the mainstream media, there's ample cause to believe that America, like

its counterparts that sell just lamps, bulbs, and Scotch tape, is becoming a

one-product economy: Just War. And where there is just war, there will be no

justice.
