            In the waning days of his administration, President Clinton has been 

            building a positive environmental legacy by protecting wilderness 

            areas and creating new national monuments in the west. Depending on 

            steps that his administration takes in the next dew days, however, 

            he might leave an indelible black mark on that legacy by undermining 

            one of the nation's most important environmental laws and paving the 

            way for the continued decline and possible extinction of one of the 

            world's most spectacular marine mammals. 

            <P> At issue is the Steller sea lion, a magnificent creature that 

              makes its home in the waters off Alaska. Weighing up to a ton and 

              capable of diving up to 800 feet below the surface, these remarkable 

              animals feed on a variety of sea life including Pacific cod, Atka 

              mackerel, salmon, octopus and pollock. As recently as 1960, about 

              200,000 Stellers lived in the North Pacific, making their homes 

              on the rocky islands in the Bering Sea and Gulf of Alaska. Over 

              the last 4 decades, however, the sea lion population has plummeted 

              by almost 90 percent. Today, there are fewer than 25,000 left. 

            <P> The precipitous decline of the sea lion population over the last 

              40 years has coincided with a virtual explosion of commercial fishing 

              in the region, first by foreign factory trawlers in the 1960s and 

              70s, and then by American vessels. While there are differing opinions 

              regarding the cause of the sea lion's decline, the majority of marine 

              biologists familiar with the problem attribute it to an inadequate 

              food supply caused by over fishing. Quite simply, sea lions are 

              no longer able to compete with commercial fishermen who are taking 

              too many fish from those areas critical to their survival.

            <P> Although the Steller sea lion was listed as an endangered species 

              in 1997, the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) was reluctant 

              to restrict commercial fishing in those areas where sea lions forage 

              for food until a federal judge, responding to a lawsuit brought 

              by several environmental organizations including Greenpeace, ordered 

              such restrictions in July of this year. Further support for such 

              restrictions was provided by government scientists working for the 

              NMFS who, on December 1, released a long awaited report which concluded 

              that commercial fishing in the North Pacific is likely harming sea 

              lions and must be restricted in order to insure their survival.

            <P> The judge's order, which temporarily prohibited trawl fishing 

              in those areas deemed essential for the survival and recovery of 

              endangered sea lions, caused a howl of protest from the commercial 

              fishing industry in Alaska. It also prompted Alaska Senator Ted 

              Stevens, the powerful head of the Senate Appropriations Committee, 

              to attach a rider to this year's last-minute budget appropriations 

              bill that would allow fishing to continue unabated in the sea lion's 

              critical habitat, essentially waiving any and all restrictions required 

              by the Endangered Species Act.

            <P> In the weeks preceding the final debate on the budget bill, environmentalists 

              received repeated assurances from the White House that the president 

              would not sign any bill that would waive the Endangered Species 

              Act in the case of the Steller sea lion. However, on December 17, 

              Senator Stevens and the White House agreed on a final budget bill 

              that has the potential to do just that.

            <P> Under the terms of the agreement, the Secretary of Commerce is 

              directed to amend the regulations governing Alaska's groundfish 

              fishery by January 20, and is empowered to ease or eliminate restrictions 

              on fishing that the National Marine Fisheries Service has determined 

              are needed to protect the sea lion. 

            <P> The agreement essentially postpones the decision on the fate of 

              the sea lion to the final day of the Clinton presidency. It provides 

              enough latitude for the president to direct that new regulations 

              be issued that will protect the Steller sea lion and comply with 

              the requirements of the Endangered Species Act. Conversely, such 

              regulations can be written in a way that will condemn the sea lion 

              to further declines and possible extinction. With the administration 

              winding down, will the president and the secretary of commerce do 

              the right thing? Or, in the commotion of leaving office, on a day 

              when no one is paying attention to anything but the departure of 

              one president and the arrival of another, will one of the last acts 

              of .Clinton be to seal the fate of the sea lion, and in so doing 

              set a precedent for future presidents to further undermine one of 

              the nation's most cherished environmental laws? Let us hope he takes 

              the nobler course.
