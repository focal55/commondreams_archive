The September 11 attackers achieved the precise victory we

denied Timothy McVeigh.  They suckered a nation into treating terrorists

as warriors instead of criminals.  McVeigh saw himself as a freedom

fighter in a war waged by the U.S. government upon We, The People.  We

saw him as a criminal, whose political motives could not transform

murder into an act of war.  What McVeigh failed to do through a steady

stream of interviews, essays, and letters, the September 11 attackers

achieved without uttering a word.  We spoke the word for them.

<p>Whether in the midst of a personal crisis or a national one, our

first response is emotional.  A storm of feelings at such times

overwhelms our capacity to reason and to articulate what is happening to

us.

<p>No event in most of our lifetimes has more completely befuddled

us than last week's.  No one had the words.  Even those whose daily

lives and work consists of bringing language to life were speechless.

<p>No wonder, then, that George Bush, famous for his lack of

linguistic talent, should seize so quickly upon the most apocalyptic

metaphor and signifier: war.  In the moment of our shock and horror, it

seemed to all of us that there was no other word big enough.

<p>But war is not the right word.  If we fail to correct this

definitional error, this word will hijack our future.

<p>By "war," we generally refer to a conflict between states or

nations or between factions within a state.  It connotes parity between

the participants.  When we declare ourselves to be at war with the

perpetrators of the September 11 attack, we elevate the attackers to the



status of nation, with consequences we probably neither intend nor

desire.

<p>As far as we know, the attack was not the work of a nation or

state, but of individuals who have no regard for the laws and moral

codes to which the rest of us across the world subscribe and conform our

behavior.  Such people are called criminals and the action we take

against them, to protect ourselves and to punish them, is called

criminal prosecution.  It is not a war.  To bring such people to

justice, we do not conquer them; we arrest them, indict them, bring them

to trial.

<p>The difference in characterization is enormous.  The rhetoric of

war justifies, to many minds already, a wholesale revision to the Bill

of Rights.  We have seen the President call up tens of thousands of

reservists, though to what purpose remains unclear.  Parents around the

country wonder whether their children may be drafted to fight a war

against an enemy whose face we do not even know.  A war effort means the

growth of a bigger government, ironically at the insistence of those who

ran for office against "big government."  It necessitates a re-ordering

of our priorities, with consequences to education, health care,

environment and economy.

<p>There are also international implications to the difference in

characterization.  What nation could deny us our right to prosecute the

criminals who murdered 6000 citizens and guests of this country?  Many

nations may, however, balk to support a war effort, and, in doing so,

they may be exercising the calm and reason we cannot in our grief and

anger muster.  Indeed, the unification of all the world's nations (with

the exception, perhaps, of Iraq) behind a prosecution of the attackers

as criminals would solidify the international community as one ruled by

law, a society responding to an offense upon the whole.  If September 11

made clear how global our world today is, our response could engender a

global sense of mutuality, commonality, community.  Law binds community;

it places all of us on one side arrayed against those who injure the

community.  Who in the world doubts that murder is wrong?  War, by

contrast, and as is already obvious in the "with-us-or-against-us"

ultimatums being issued by the administration, divides the community of

nations.  By committing ourselves to war as a response, not only do we

lose the opportunity to lead a world united by law into this new

century, we condemn the world to the same destructive mechanisms of the

last century.

<p>Acts of war, however destructive or reprehensible, do not carry

the same freight as criminal acts.  War justifies killing.  Indeed, acts

committed during war that overstep the rules of war, are prosecuted as

crimes against humanity.  In our shock, we awarded to the September 11

attackers a rhetorical victory.  We made warriors of criminals; now we

must make them back into criminals and treat them accordingly.  By doing

so, we can reclaim our lives, from terrorists and politicians alike,

rather than yield to the chaos of war.
