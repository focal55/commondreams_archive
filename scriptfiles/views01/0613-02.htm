For the first time in almost four decades, the tax dollars of Wisconsinites went to pay for an execution on U.S. soil Monday - making the citizens of this historically anti-death penalty state an accomplice in the most heinous of all abuses of government authority.

<P>For 150 years, Wisconsin has banned the death penalty. Of all the legal jurisdictions on the planet with the power to bar capital punishment, only one has officially rejected the practice for a longer period.

<P>The jurisdiction with the longest ban on state-sponsored slayings is Iowa, which enacted its ban upon achieving statehood in 1846. And it is notable that the rest of the upper Midwest shares Wisconsin and Iowa's aversion to capital punishment - Michigan, Minnesota and North Dakota also reject the death penalty as a legitimate means of punishment. (The other states that ban executions are Alaska, Hawaii, Maine, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Vermont and West Virginia. The District of Columbia also bars executions.) For the past 38 years, the 13 U.S. jurisdictions that ban capital punishment have been able to say that they are not a part of the killing machine that operates in less-enlightened states such as Texas, Florida and Virginia. With the execution of Tim McVeigh, however, that out is gone.

<P>We are part of it.

<P>And, as citizens of a state with an anti-death penalty tradition, we have a responsibility to engage in the debate more passionately than before. Because now, we too are paying to extinguish the lives of individuals who are imprisoned, restrained and pose no threat to society.

<P>To the credit of Wisconsinites, they have done just that. Several dozen Madisonians gathered Monday outside the federal courthouse in Madison to protest the killing. And on WTDY radio, morning host John "Sly" Sylvester devoted most of his four-hour program to expressing his outrage at the execution, as did many of his callers.

<P>To be sure, Sly had to argue with plenty of vengeance-driven backers of capital punishment, as well as a few usual foes of the practice who said they would make a rare exception for McVeigh. Sly's response: "No exceptions! Killing is killing." When some callers suggested that the enormity of the crime called for extreme measures, Sly asked, "Are the lives of those victims in Oklahoma City any more precious than the life of a clerk who gets blown away at a convenience store? I don't think so. The death penalty is wrong, no matter who the victim is, no matter what the circumstances."

<P>As reassuring as the street activism and Sly's impassioned remarks was a quiet comment from U.S. Sen. Russ Feingold, D-Wis., the Senate's leading foe of the death penalty.

<P>With his usual insight, Feingold pointed out that the execution of McVeigh had drawn international, round-the-clock media attention. He contrasted that with the relative lack of attention to Sirhan Sirhan, who assassinated Robert F. Kennedy in 1968. Sirhan was tried, convicted, sentenced to life imprisonment and reduced to footnote status in the story of a great man. McVeigh, because he was executed, will undoubtedly remain in the public consciousness for generations to come.

<P>Feingold's point should not be lost in the frenzy of reporting on McVeigh's execution.

<P>State-sponsored executions do not provide closure or finality. Rather, they shift the focus from the victims of crimes to the punishment of those crimes - a step that reduces our humanity one step further.</p>
