Censorship in the United States today is seldom deliberate. Instead it

comes stealthily under the heading Missed Opportunities. Mega-merged

corporate media are predominantly interested in the entertainment value

of news and the maintenance of high audience viewing/reading levels that

lead to profitable advertising sales. Non-sexy or complex stories tend

to receive little attention within these corporate media systems.

<p>A recent Pew Research Center poll showed more than 77 percent of all

journalists admitted that news stories that were perceived as important

but dull are sometimes ignored. More than a third polled stated that

news stories that would hurt the financial interests of their news

organization often or sometimes go unreported.

<p>This structural arrangement is what censorship looks like in America

today: not usually a deliberate killing of stories by official censors,

but rather a subtle system of information suppression in the name of

corporate profit and self interest. Corporate media censorship is an

attack on democracy itself. It undermines the very fabric of our society

by creating a highly entertained but poorly informed electorate.

<p>Given that corporate media systemically censor important news stories,

it is not hard to understand why more than 50 million eligible voters do

not bother to vote. Without essential knowledge of important political

issues, voter apathy is rampant, and political parties may tend to

appear different, but act alike.

<p>Sonoma State University Project Censored students and staff screened

several thousand stories last year. 700 of these were selected for

evaluation by faculty and community evaluators. Our 89 Faculty/community

evaluators are experts in their individual fields and they rate the

stories for credibility and national importance. About 125 stories each

year make the final voting level. Project-wide voting of some 150+

people establishes which 25 of the stories will be listed in our annual

book Censored 2001.
