The Pentagon's air drops of food parcels and President Bush's plea 

for American children to aid Afghan kids with dollar bills will go down in 

history as two of the most cynical maneuvers of media manipulation in the 

early 21st century.



<p>Many U.S. news outlets have been eager to play along. A New York 

Times editorial proclaimed that "Mr. Bush has wisely made providing 

humanitarian assistance to the Afghan people an integral part of American 

strategy." Four days later, on Oct. 12, the same newspaper still had 

nothing but praise for the U.S. government's food aid charades: "His 

reaffirmation of the need for humanitarian aid to the people of Afghanistan 

-- including donations from American children -- seemed heartfelt."



<p>While thousands of kids across the United States stuff dollar 

bills into envelopes and mail them to the White House, the U.S. government 

continues a bombing campaign that is accelerating the momentum of mass 

starvation in Afghanistan.



<p>Relief workers have voiced escalating alarm. Jonathan Patrick, an 

official with the humanitarian aid group Concern, minced no words. He 

called the food drops "absolute nonsense."



<p>"What we need is 20-ton trucks in huge convoys going across the 

border all the time," said Patrick, based in Islamabad. But when the 

bombing began, the truck traffic into Afghanistan stopped.



<p>In tandem with the bombing campaign, the U.S. government launched 

a PR blitz about its food-from-the-sky effort. But the Nobel-winning French 

organization Doctors Without Borders has charged that the gambit is 

"virtually useless and may even be dangerous." One aid group after another 

echoes the assessment. The U.S. has been dropping 37,000 meals a day on a 

country where several million Afghans face the imminent threat of 

starvation. Some of the food, inevitably, is landing on minefields.



<p>The food drops began on Sunday, Oct. 7, simultaneous with the 

start of the bombing. "As of Thursday, a Pentagon spokeswoman said more 

than 137,000 of the yellow-packaged rations had been dropped," the 

Knight-Ridder News Service reported on Oct. 12. "International aid 

organization officials say, however, that around 5 million Afghans are in 

danger of starvation because the nation's borders are sealed and food 

supplies are diminishing by the day -- meaning that only a tiny percentage 

of the hungry are receiving the U.S. food." The borders are sealed because 

of the continuous bombing.



<p>Pentagon chief Donald Rumsfeld wasn't worried about provoking 

appropriate derision and outrage when he told reporters on Oct. 8: "It is 

quite true that 37,000 rations in a day do not feed millions of human 

beings. On the other hand, if you were one of the starving people who got 

one of the rations, you'd be appreciative."



<p>Avowedly, the main targets of the bombing are the people in the 

bin Laden network and their Taliban supporters. But the rhetorical salvoes 

will be understood, all too appropriately, in wider contexts. "We will root 

them out and starve them out," Rumsfeld said, just before closing a news 

conference with a ringing declaration: "We are determined not to be 

terrorized."



<p>Supposedly, bombing Afghanistan is going to make us safer back 

here in the USA. But as soon as the attacks began on Oct. 7, the FBI called 

for heightened alerts across the United States -- because the risk of 

another deadly attack in this country had just increased. What's wrong with 

this picture?



<p>Unlike the media herd, longtime foreign correspondent Robert Fisk 

is exploring key questions. "President Bush says this is a war between good 

and evil," he writes in the London-based Independent newspaper. "You are 

either with us or against us. But that's exactly what bin Laden says. Isn't 

it worth pointing this out and asking where it leads?"



<p>Fisk asks other questions that aren't ready for prime time: "Why 

are we journalists falling back on the same sheep-like conformity that we 

adopted in the 1991 Gulf War and the 1999 Kosovo war? ... Is there some 

kind of rhetorical fog that envelopes us every time we bomb someone?"

<p>In wartime, media accounts seem to zigzag between selected facts 

and easy sentimentality. Michael Herr, a journalist who covered the Vietnam 

War, later wrote that the U.S. media "never found a way to report 

meaningfully about death, which of course was really what it was all 

about." Obscured by countless news stories, "the suffering was somehow 

unimpressive." Accustomed to seeing its military might as self-justifying, 

the USA powered ahead. "We took space back quickly, expensively, with total 

panic and close to maximum brutality," Herr observed. "Our machine was 

devastating. And versatile. It could do everything but stop."



<p>In its Oct. 12 editorial, headlined "Mr. Bush's New Gravitas," the 

New York Times concluded that the current president is providing exactly 

the kind of leadership we need: "As he reflected on the sorrow, compassion 

and determination that have swept the country since those horrifying hours 

on the morning of Sept. 11, he seemed to be a leader whom the nation could 

follow in these difficult times."



<p>Among the leadership qualities most appreciated by editorial 

writers is the Bush administration's aptitude for shameless propaganda. 

While the Pentagon keeps dropping tons of bombs, it scatters some meals to 

the winds. While the U.S. government persists with a bombing campaign that 

shows every sign of resulting in mass starvation, the president urges the 

young people of the United States to send in dollar bills -- "to join in a 

special effort to help the children of Afghanistan."
