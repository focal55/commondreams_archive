The political success of the Bush Administration's

tax cut strategy will depend on how much they can

deceive people as to who gets what. Most Americans, no

matter how much they hate paying taxes, do not believe

that the richest people should be first in line when it

comes to getting tax relief.



         <p>The estate tax (dubbed the "death tax" by

Republicans in order to make it sound sinister) is

something that 98 percent of Americans will never have

to worry about. That's because they do not leave enough

assets to be taxed when they die. A married couple can

already exempt $1.35 million, and this rises to $2 million

by 2006. And anything that is left to a spouse is tax-free.



         <p>Mr. Bush has proposed to abolish the estate tax.

The largest beneficiaries of this generosity would be

about 2400 estates that pay half of the tax. The lucky

heirs would save an average of about $3.4 million each.



         <p>Call it a "Head Start" program for the rich. But the

Bush Administration has a different spin: it's all a valiant

effort to spare family-owned businesses and farms from

being broken up on account of the "death tax."



         <p>Reality check:  94 percent of farms, of any size,

are not subject to estate taxes. Small farms and businesses

have higher exemptions and other special treatments, and

there are very few estates that are made up primarily of

these assets. In 1998, there were only 776 taxable estates-

- less than 1.6 percent of the total-- in which the majority

of the estate consisted of family-owned business assets.

The number was even smaller for farms.



         <p>The tax-cutters have also proposed to fix the

"marriage penalty," under which some married couples

pay more income taxes than they would if they had filed

individual returns. But here, too, Mr. Bush's solution is

skewed toward upper-income households-- some of

which already benefit from a "marriage bonus," as

opposed to a penalty.



         <p>The harshest effect of the marriage penalty falls

on low-income households who qualify for the federal

Earned Income Tax Credit. We are talking couples who

earn less than $15,000 each, who can easily lose more

than $3000 a year when they get married. Mr. Bush's tax

overhaul will not get rid of this inequity.



         <p>A detailed analysis of the whole $1.6 trillion tax

cut, as done by the Citizens for Tax Justice, shows that

43% of it would wind up in the hands of the richest 1% of

taxpayers: those with an average income of $915,000

would get an average tax cut of $46,000 a year. For the

bottom 60% of taxpayers (income less than $39,000), the

average tax cut would be $227.



         <p>Of course, there is a case to be made for shifting

the tax burden-- in the other direction. And fortunately,

there is a sizeable source of tax revenue yet untapped:

financial and currency transactions. A very small tax on

the buying and selling of stocks, bonds and currency

would barely be noticed by long-term investors, but

would discourage speculative trading. Such a tax would

not only raise a good deal of revenue, but would help get

rid of some of the waste and instability in our bloated

financial markets.



         <p>In case the projected budget surpluses turn out to

be smaller than predicted, a "speculation tax" would

supply the necessary revenue for a tax cut to those who

most need and deserve it: the majority of Americans, who

have not shared in the economic growth of the last

quarter-century.
