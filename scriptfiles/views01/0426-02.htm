We are on the brink of a court-packing crisis. President Bush,

relying on the conservative Federalist Society as his principal advisor,

soon will be sending a stream of right-wing ideologues to the Senate for

confirmation to the nation's federal courts. This will pave the way for

hard-right nominations to the U.S. Supreme Court as the high court's

justices depart.

<p>So long as the president is left unchecked, he will be sorely tempted

to ram high court appointments through the evenly divided Senate on a

vote of 51 to 50, relying on Vice President Dick Cheney for the

tie-breaking vote.

<p>If this gambit succeeds, the result will be nothing less than a

constitutional revolution. The present court has three youthful

conservatives--Justices Clarence Thomas, 52, Anthony M. Kennedy, 64, and

Antonin Scalia, 65. With a bit of reinforcement, a hard-right majority on

the nine-member court will rule the nation long after George W. Bush has

left the White House.

<p>The current judicial majority has already put the nation on notice of

its revolutionary agenda, striking down the Violence Against Women Act

and seriously weakening the Americans With Disabilities Act.

<p>Once rejuvenated, the majority can be expected to thwart efforts to

secure genuine equality for all Americans, create new constitutional

limits on environmental protection and impose the religious right's

fundamentalist morality on just about everyone.

<p>Are most Americans really prepared for this brave new world? How will

they respond when told that they must wait 10 or 15 years to reassert

control over their personal and political destiny?

<p>There have been other runaway courts in our history. The most famous

was the reactionary court of the 1930s that made war on Franklin D.

Roosevelt's hugely popular New Deal. In time, however, Roosevelt made

appointments to the court, which were confirmed by the Senate, that

brought the court more into line with public thinking.

<p>But President Bush is no Roosevelt. In precipitating a sweeping

constitutional revolution, he cannot claim a broad popular mandate for

change. To the contrary, he has been placed in the White House by the

same judicial bloc whose grasp on power he would be extending.

<p>This is the first time in American history that the majority of the

Supreme Court has the potential to arrange for its own succession. By

intervening in the last presidential election, the conservative majority

removed the American people's check on a runaway court. It is one thing

for the justices, who are not elected, to exercise the sovereign power of

judicial review. It is quite another for them to insulate themselves yet

further from popular control by putting their man in the White House.

<p>This unprecedented situation requires the Senate to ask new questions

and draw new lines. The first step should be a moratorium on Supreme

Court appointments until the American people return to the polls in 2004.

Under present rules, it only takes 40 senators to block any appointment

to the court. Senators should use this power to force President Bush to

demonstrate that he can win reelection in 2004 without the court's

assistance.

<p>While the present case has no exact historical parallel, another

episode does provide a precedent for a moratorium. When President Lincoln

was assassinated, he was replaced by Vice President Andrew Johnson, who

threatened to pack the court with conservatives. Congress responded with

a statute disabling him from replacing retiring justices. It explained

that it was John Wilkes Booth, not the American people, who had

transformed Johnson into the president. Clearly, Congress would not have

deprived Lincoln of his choices for the court.

<p>By the time Johnson left the White House in 1868, the court was

reduced to seven members. After the election, Congress returned the

court's size to nine, giving Ulysses S. Grant the power to fill

vacancies.

<p>A similar logic applies today. The right-wing bloc on the court should

not be permitted to extend its control for a decade or more simply

because it made rulings that cleared the way for Bush to take the White

House.

<p>The Supreme Court has often functioned perfectly well without its full

complement. During the 1990s, the justices cut their workload

dramatically and now deliver only 80 opinions each year. They can easily

maintain this pace with two or three fewer justices.

<p>A strict moratorium is not appropriate in the case of nominations to

the lower courts. Some new appointments are required for the effective

administration of justice. But this is no reason to populate the courts

with judicial ideologues intent on a revolutionary agenda.

<p>The Bush administration's peremptory ejection of the American Bar

Assn. from its traditional role in vetting nominations makes senatorial

scrutiny especially imperative. Despite Bush's wishes, the Senate should

continue to require that the ABA thoroughly investigate a nominee's

background. Only then can the Senate be in a position to consider soberly

whether a nominee is a mainstream jurist with solid professional

credentials.
