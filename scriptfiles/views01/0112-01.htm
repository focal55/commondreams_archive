Hey, kids, what time is it? It's inauguration time!



         <p>By accident of history, the guy in the starring role bears a 

passing resemblance to Howdy Doody. What's more, his V.P. partner could 

evoke memories of Phineas T. Bluster.



         <p>But the incoming president is no dummy -- and pundits who cast 

aspersions on his intelligence are missing the point. Even a puppet needs 

some smarts! And to a great extent, you can judge a marionette by the 

company he keeps.



         <p>This one has some very wily pals. They ooze with money, flex their 

corporate muscles, and exude certainty about how to call the shots for the 

nation's grandest institutions. Yet they've been scrambling to overcome 

some unusual barriers to authoritative control over the executive branch.



         <p>Now, it turns out that George W. Bush lost the nationwide popular 

vote by an even wider margin than had been reported. The final certified 

results: Al Gore received 539,947 more votes than Bush did.



         <p>The degree to which Bush can succeed at flaunting himself as the 

people's choice will largely depend on the dynamics of media coverage and 

the behavior of Democrats on Capitol Hill. Right now, for the most part, 

those Democrats seem inclined to let bygones be bygones -- signaling to 

journalists that they may as well do the same.



         <p>But shrugging off recent electoral history requires downplaying 

the series of key events that ended with five members of the U.S. Supreme 

Court handing the presidency to Bush. One of the questions blowing in the 

wind: Does it matter that many thousands of African-American voters did not 

get their ballots counted in Florida?



         <p>Not much -- according to all 50 Democrats in the Senate. If even 

one senator had joined with members of the Congressional Black Caucus and 

others in the House who challenged Florida's 25 electoral votes, the issue 

would have been legally forced into the open for debate. But when push came 

to shove at the end of the first week of January, not a single such senator 

could be found.



         <p>By opting for convenient amnesia over obstinate memory, every 

person in the Senate avoided the risk of widespread media derision. After 

all, the conventional wisdom is that the national political spotlight has 

moved on. It's time to hail the next chief, the triumphant runner-up.



         <p>Because of the sustained uproar and bitterness that punctuated so 

much of what's usually a placid time in American presidential politics -- 

the stretch between Election Day and Inauguration Day -- the ceremonies in 

Washington on Jan. 20 probably take on added importance. Orchestration is 

the name of the media game: Each new administration works closely with many 

journalists to generate plenty of momentous salutes and hosannas.



         <p>Typically, at the start of a new presidency, the leaders of the 

major party that failed to win the White House feel that it's necessary to 

make an obsequious show of burying the hatchet. Hyperboles are common as 

politicians say things like "he is president of all the people" and "all 

Americans support our new president and wish him well."



         <p>We can now expect a deluge of such laughable assertions -- not 

only from leading lights of the Republican and Democratic parties but also 

from a remarkable number of journalists who feel compelled to echo that 

kind of prattle.



         <p>"Journalism," a modern cliche tells us, "is the first draft of 

history." But for most politicians, it's the draft that clearly matters 

most. Wielding power is about the here and now. What Americans read, hear 

and watch every day shapes the media terrain through which a president 

walks. Historians wait their turn.



         <p>Presidents are fond of equating their power with benevolent 

leadership. When news outlets buy into that equation, they lavish adulation 

on a president simply -- in effect -- for being president. In the process, 

they substitute mythology for journalism.



         <p>Despite the upbeat inaugural stories, underlying realities are apt 

to be quite grim. "There is no necessary connection between the desire to 

lead and the ability to lead, and even less to the ability to lead 

somewhere that will be to the advantage of the led," the American writer 

Bergen Evans observed a half-century ago. He added: "Leadership is more 

likely to be assumed by the aggressive than by the able, and those who 

scramble to the top are more often motivated by their own inner torments 

than by any demand for their guidance."
