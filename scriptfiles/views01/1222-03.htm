Military officials assert that high-tech weapons and precision bombing have 

kept that number low. Reports of civilian casualties -- whether coming from 

the Taliban or independent observers -- are routinely dismissed by the 

Pentagon as fabrications or exaggerations. U.S. journalists sometimes offer 

estimates of civilian deaths after a particular bombing raid, always 

cautioning that the reports can’t be confirmed.



<p>In the foreign press, however, the question is more prominent, and regular 

reports of heavy civilian casualties as a result of the U.S. bombing have 

fueled anti-American sentiment around the world.



<p>Given these conflicting accounts, one might think a carefully documented 

study by an independent American researcher might be of great interest. One 

might expect U.S. reporters to be clamoring for a copy and requesting 

interviews with the study’s author.



<p>But in terms of mainstream news interest, it was a quiet week in Durham, 

NH, Marc Herold’s hometown.



<p>On Dec.10, the University of New Hampshire professor released his finding 

that at least 3,767 Afghan civilians had died in the first 8 ½ weeks of the 

war. With some help from media activists, a news release was faxed to the 

major print and broadcast media. Follow-up calls were made to journalists. 

Herold’s report was posted on the Internet, along with the database he had 

compiled, for easy access.



<p>One week later, readers could find coverage of Herold’s studies on a few 

independent web sites and an Internet radio program. But a search of the 

two major databases for U.S. newspapers and television news programs turned 

up no mention of his work.



<p>Why does this matter? Herold, a professor of economics and women’s studies, 

said the lack of coverage of “the carnage on the ground” has shaped the 

public’s perception of the fighting.



<p>“The war has been presented to the American people as a techno-video war in 

which smart bombs always hit their targets. In other words, the bad guys 

die and none of the good guys do,” said Herold, whose research and teaching 

focuses on third-world economic and social development. “But there have 

been a significant number of civilian casualties.”



<p>Herold is a critic of the war with progressive politics, but his estimate 

of civilian deaths is, if anything, overly conservative. Aware that his 

methodology would be scrutinized, he relied on reports from official news 

agencies, major newspapers around the world, and first-hand accounts, 

seeking cross-corroboration whenever possible. When precise figures weren’t 

available, he did not arbitrarily plug in numbers, and he also did not use 

estimates of the indirect deaths that result when, for example, bombing 

shuts down a hospital. As a result, Herold’s number likely is an 

undercount; he estimates 5,000 civilian deaths in those weeks is probably 

closer to the truth.



<p>By the conventional standards of newsworthiness listed (such as timeliness, 

relevance to audience, impact), Herold’s study is not only news but 

reasonably big news. It sheds light on a subject of great moral, political, 

and strategic importance that has been undercovered in the mainstream U.S. 

news media.



<p>Even if one takes issue with his final count, at the very least Herold’s 

report could jump start a conversation that should have been front and 

center from the beginning: Was a war necessary? Were there more effective 

ways to try to end terrorism than a war that has killed a large number of 

civilians -- now as least as many innocents as died in the Sept. 11 attacks?



<p>Herold’s data should lead us to a fuller discussion of a number of 

questions: How precise are our precision weapons, which account for about 

60 percent of the bombs being dropped? What about the effects of the 

conventional “dumb” bombs that make up the other 40 percent? What are the 

effects on civilians of indiscriminate weapons such as cluster bombs, which 

Human Rights Watch has argued should be banned? Are the military’s methods 

an indication that U.S. planners simply don’t value the lives of Third 

World people?



<p>Administration officials and military officers no doubt want to downplay 

civilian casualties to avoid undermining support for the war. But it is 

disappointing that journalists -- who claim to be the watchdogs of 

government -- have not covered Herold’s study and the crucial issues it 

raises.
