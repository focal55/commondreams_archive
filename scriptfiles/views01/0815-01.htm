            <p> Israel invaded Palestine once more last night. Where did I turn this morning for an alternative to the mass media? Amy Goodman's award-winning program, Democracy Now! of course. That's where curious folks have turned for years when they are seeking some relief from the homogenized drivel the establishment media pass off as news. 

<br><br>

I read the New York Times version: Israeli tanks "rumble" into a Palestinian-controlled town but "pull out quickly" in what "seemed" to be the strongest assault to date. Then I turned to "Democracy Now!" to hear someone  or several people -- who might talk sense, whom I don't see nightly on MSNBC or CNN or FOX. 

<br><br>

This fresh perspective might point out, for example, that if the tanks that had violated an internationally-recognized border were Iraqi, rather than Israeli (and Iraqi soldiers rather than Israelis had commandeered the headquarters of a foreign city's governor and bulldozed the police station of a foreign state), the United States would probably be at war -- or at least heading up a NATO mission to exact vengeance on behalf of those who'd been invaded and occupied. 

<br><br>

<A HREF="http://www.democracynow.org/" target="new">Democracy Now!</A> aired voices like those on Monday ... when they were audible. You see, there were a lot of technical problems with the broadcast, because early last week Goodman and her team were ordered out of the main studio at their station -- listener-supported Pacifica station WBAI. 

<br><br>

 Interim General Manager Utrice Leid exiled them to an inferior 

substudio. I know the place. It's a wonder Goodman's crew can call across town from there, let alone across the world. Monday's guest -- who was reporting live from Jerusalem -- was barely audible and the program was plagued with ear-piercing feedback. It's no place from which to produce a national show that broadcasts live across the nation. Hell, that studio doesn't even have a working clock. 

<br><br>

Who knows whom Goodman interviewed this morning. I couldn't hear the show, and neither could my fellow listeners at more than thirty stations around the USA. Why? Because the people who've hijacked Pacifica -- the people's network, the network I've helped sustain for years with my work, love and, yes, my cash -- refused to air the show.

<br><br>

Since Leid took over WBAI this past December, Goodman's been the target of harassment and abuse from Leid's team in what Leid (on air) has called a "war." Those who've listened in have heard it. Some have seen it for 

themselves. You can find out more on a slew of websites. But try to call WBAI as I did, and -- forget it -- Leid's voicemessage box is routinely full. 

<br><br>

On Friday, Goodman wrote to her Pacifica bosses, informing them that the crisis had escalated to physical violence. Leid apparently shoved Goodman physically and seized her camera when Goodman interrupted people rifling through the personal possessions of fired WBAI Program Director Bernard White. 

<br><br>

Having received no response over the weekend from Steve Yasko, her 

supervisor, on Monday, Amy wrote again. "The Democracy Now team can no 

longer produce a program under these hate-filled and unprofessional conditions. We have no safe space at WBAI," she said, and she announced her intention to move elsewhere.  

<br><br>

Tuesday, Goodman broadcast from a reliable community media facility that sent her signal, as usual, to WPFW, the Pacifica station that transmits Pacifica national programming to Pacifica's satellite. And someone there in Washington  decided not to send out the program. (Instead they ran an "encore" broadcast.) 

<br><br>

Goodman's bosses talk about professionalism. It's been the rallying cry for 

the Pacifica "reformers" for years and in some cases the excuse to purge 

programming and programmers that certain station managers didn't like. But 

there's nothing professional about what's going on at Pacifica. The denial 

this morning of Democracy Now! to a network of community stations that rely on 

Pacifica to bring them the broadcast -- that's not professional. As Christine 

Ahern, station manager of affiliate station WJFF in Jeffersonville, N.Y., 

put it Tuesday morning, "Professional? It's anything but." 

<br><br>

Ahern waited as usual for Democracy Now! this morning. Like more than 30 other 

stations, a few years back, she signed on at some expense with Pacifica's own 

KU satellite service, so Pacifica controls the flow of their programs to her audience. She heard the out-of-date tape and called WBAI. "Amy didn't call and she 

didn't come in," Ahern was told. 

<br><br>

Leid's voicemail box was full and the machine wasn't taking messages. Pacifica Executive Director Bessie Wash's machine in Washington was on. Calls to WBAI's direct, on-air line were not answered. By noon, no one had called Ahern back. It's par for the course, she says. "It's abominable how Pacifica treats us affiliates. They're don't 

return calls, they don't answer letters. They're not responsible."  At this point, she says, "The only reason WJFF is an affiliate is to get Democracy Now!"

<br><br>

Pacifica's treatment of Goodman, is indeed abominable. This is no way to 

treat the host of your most well-known and most acclaimed show. It is no way 

to treat clients -- those stations who give the Pacifica Foundation precious, 

pledge-drive donated dollars in exchange for reliable, high quality, 

programming. They have a right to the programming they pay for, and to 

communication and respect. 

<br><br>

It's also no way to treat us, the listeners, who pay -- or have until now 

paid -- the vast majority of the network's bills, and have fought, and still 

fight, to keep alive the nation's only commercial-free, listener-supported 

network of radio stations. (For a reminder of why this fight's important, 

read today's Wall St. Journal, on how Religious Right broadcasters are using 

FCC rules to expand their empire at NPR's expense.) 

<br><br>

Juan Gonzalez, who was Goodman's co-host on Democracy Now! until he resigned 

in protest earlier this year, is asking people who care to pick up the phone. 

Call the people who have taken control of Pacifica and tell them to stop the 

threats, slander and physical intimidation of Amy Goodman and to resign. Tell them to step aside and allow for new leadership to begin to rebuild.

<br><br>

Contact information for the Pacifica board is available on many sites 

including Gonzalez's <A HREF="http://www.pacificacampaign.org" target="new">Pacifica Campaign</A>. You can also get updates through <A HREF="http://www.wbix.org" target="new">WBAI In Exile</A>, <A HREF="http://www.kpfa.org" target="new">KPFA</A> and the Concerned Friends Hotline at 800-825-0055.

<br><br>

Together, as Juan says, we can stop this madness. Pick up the phone. Do it now.
