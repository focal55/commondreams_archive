As Americans, we face a slew of choices for addressing our energy needs, but no single option will solve the whole problem. The smart decision is to choose options that are affordable, clean, fast and reliable for future generations. For these reasons, coal should be a last choice in any energy plan.<p>

  Burning coal is the largest source of toxic air pollution in the country and a significant cause of global warming pollution worldwide. Coal-fired power plants are one of the biggest culprits for air pollution.<p>

  Coal-fired power plants produce 96 percent of the utility industry's sulfur-dioxide pollution that causes acid rain; 93 percent of the industry's nitrogen-oxide pollution that causes soot and smog; 88 percent of the industry's carbon-dioxide pollution that causes global warming; and 99 percent of the industry's toxic mercury pollution that poisons our water and our health.<p>

  Don't be fooled by the Orwellian newspeak of industry's proposed &quot;clean coal&quot; -- it's a coat of greenwash trying to hide one of the most polluting energy forms around.<p>

  &quot;Clean coal&quot; only strives to reduce some of these pollutants -- they don't disappear. It's not hard to make some progress with the dirtiest form of energy production, but &quot;clean coal&quot; is still dirty.<p>

  The United States has 4 percent of the world's population yet emits 25 percent of the global warming pollution. A panel of the world's leading climate scientists warned in January that global warming will lead to worsening heat waves, floods, droughts, extreme weather, rising sea levels and spreading infectious diseases. No matter how friendly the coal industry tries to sound, &quot;clean coal&quot; does nothing to reduce carbon-dioxide pollution from burning coal that causes global warming.<p>

  Regardless of what you call it, extracting all types of coal harms our health, disrupts communities and ruins the environment by polluting water, depleting drinking water supplies and destroying land.<p>

  Mountaintop removal methods of coal mining are particularly egregious and are responsible for lopping off entire Appalachian hilltops and burying streams under huge waste piles.<p>

  Instead of damaging our air and lungs with coal pollution, our nation should adopt a balanced approach to meet our energy needs. We should replace dirty plants with clean and efficient ones, increase our supply of natural gas, invest more in clean renewable energy and use energy-efficient technology to make the most of what we have.<p>

  The Bush administration's preference for coal, oil and nuclear energy over efficiency and renewable energy is irresponsible.<p>

  Efficient technology meets our energy needs while saving consumers money and keeping our air and water cleaner. When we build power plants, the first choice should be renewable energy like solar, wind and geothermal at competitive prices.<p>

  Any proposal to increase our reliance on coal for power is misguided. Our children deserve clean air and clean water and the ability to turn on the lights. We can meet this challenge with efficiency and clean power. Coal simply doesn't belong in a clean energy future.
