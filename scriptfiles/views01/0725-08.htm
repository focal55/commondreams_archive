From Genoa, Italy, to the Bay Area, these are heady yet bewildering times 

for the growing throngs of people who are taking to the streets to denounce 

free trade.

<P>Last weekend's Group of Eight summit was yet more proof that the anti-

globalization movement has become the biggest left-of-center force for social 

protest in decades.

<P>But many worry that the movement's newfound influence could be jeopardized 

by the hooligans who turned Genoa and other protest venues into battlegrounds.

<P>Those thoughts were going through Kevin Danaher's mind as he wandered past 

block after block of burned cars and gutted buildings in Genoa.

<P>"I've never seen anything like this," said Danaher, co-founder of Global 

Exchange, a San Francisco human rights group that has been a key organizer in 

the anti-globalization movement. Speaking by telephone, he added: "The 

violence by police and by a minority of protesters have managed to wipe our 

issues off the table."

<P>"We've advanced to the point where we have to show people that (reform) can 

be done without disorder," Danaher said.

<P>Despite the chaos, some global leaders -- including French President 

Jacques Chirac and United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan -- have 

partially endorsed the protesters' demands that trade be linked to human 

rights and the environment and that poor nations' foreign debt be forgiven.

<P>But Chirac said he and his G-8 counterparts were "traumatized" by the Genoa 

violence, which left one protester dead, more than 400 people injured and 

roughly $45 million in damages.

<P>The anti-globalization movement's growing influence can also be seen on 

Capitol Hill, where Republicans this week are fighting an uphill battle to 

renew "fast track" authority, which would enable President Bush to negotiate 

international trade pacts and force Congress to vote on them without 

amendments.

<P>Bush needs fast track to persuade foreign leaders to make concessions in 

talks at the World Trade Organization and negotiations to expand the North 

American Free Trade Agreement to the entire Western Hemisphere. Both 

initiatives are stalled because of numerous commercial disputes.

<P>The change in attitudes is personified by Rep. Robert Matsui, D-Sacramento, 

a staunch free trader who now opposes the Bush fast-track plan. "I don't agree 

with the protesters in Genoa, but there are fundamental problems we need to 

resolve about free trade," Matsui said.

<P>"For example, what kind of controls are we going to allow about food safety, like on beef hormones or genetically altered food? Or if the Europeans turn 

down American companies' mergers and acquisitions, should that be part of 

trade discussions? These are legitimate issues that this White House hasn't 

even begun to think or talk about."

<P>

<p><b>U.S. LAWS AT RISK</b></p>

<P>Like Matsui, many free-trade advocates now say that protections for labor 

rights and the environment must be included in trade pacts. Many business and 

farm groups also oppose low-price competition brought by such pacts and 

express fears that U.S. laws -- ranging from anti-dumping tariffs to health 

regulations and agricultural subsidies -- could be successfully challenged by 

other nations as trade barriers.

<P>"What's interesting is the array of people who now are working for common 

ground," said Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-San Francisco.

<P>"There's a realization that the environment and workers' rights are 

directly related to trade and must be at the core of any new agreements."

<P>The switch among congressional free traders began at the World Trade 

Organization's summit in Seattle in 1999, which collapsed amid the same sort 

of huge, chaotic demonstrations as occurred in Genoa.

<P>After Seattle came protests at annual meetings of the World Bank and 

International Monetary Fund in Washington, the Republican convention in 

Philadelphia, the Democratic convention in Los Angeles, the Americas summit in 

Quebec and a half-dozen events in Europe.

<P>Protesters say their next target comes in late September, when the World 

Bank and IMF hold another meeting in Washington.

<P>"We're at a very volatile moment of large policy debates fought under the 

cloud of increasingly loud protests, and opinions are starting to shift and 

break loose from old habits in all sorts of surprising ways," said Daniel 

Seligman, trade policy director of the Sierra Club, which has been a key 

organizer of anti-globalization protests.

<p></p>

<p><b>SECOND THOUGHTS ON FREE TRADE</b></p>

<P>Referring to the coming fast-track vote, Seligman added: "People who were 

staunch free traders are now promising to vote against a trade bill for the 

first time in their careers."

<P>Even some business leaders say it's time to compromise.

<P>"What's happened in Genoa has terrible relevance," said Joseph Harrison, 

president of the California Council for International Trade, a corporate 

lobbying group.

<P>"When we get to another conference here (in the United States), the 

protesters will be front and center and ready for battle, like Seattle and 

Quebec. In the halls of government, people have come to realize these are 

important issues."

<P>All this would be great, from the activists' point of view, except for 

those pesky radicals who keep muddying the message. Frustrated, many in the 

movement are espousing the once-heretical view that a little law and order 

isn't so bad.

<P>"We have to figure out ways of disciplining the movement," Danaher said. 

"If we don't police ourselves, the police will do it for us."

<P>Others see such attitudes as a sell-out to the establishment.

</p>

<b>NOT TURNING THE OTHER CHEEK</b>

<P>"At a certain point, when you see your friends beaten and tear gassed, you 

decide not to turn the other cheek or back down from the police when they get 

violent," said David Solnit, a leading Bay Area activist who was expelled from 

Canada when he tried to join anti-NAFTA protests -- apparently because he was 

on an international police watch list.

<P>Solnit is a puppeteer with Art and Revolution, a San Francisco group that 

has provided the oversize puppets that have adorned the protests since Seattle.

<P>"A lot of us view (the police violence) in Genoa as being similar to the 

way governments of the North have been treating people of the global South . . 

. or what police do here in Bay Area with people of color, acting like an 

occupying army," Solnit said.

<P>Seligman and other mainstream activists say that's bunk.

<P>"The protest movement has to either evolve or die," Seligman said. "We had 

been moving in the direction of making a pragmatic list of demands before the 

craziness in Genoa, and what happened there will only confirm that trend."
