Gushy reviews began as soon as George W. Bush stepped away from 

the podium in the House chamber. On NBC, Tim Russert explained that the 

performance was especially impressive due to the new president's personal 

history of being podium-adverse: "I was amazed at how conversational he was 

tonight, and confident and comfortable." An analyst for ABC News marveled 

that Bush had established a "commanding presence."



         <p>By the next day, the media verdict was in: The nation's leader is 

learning to make effective use of a TelePrompTer!



         <p>Stage presence, cadence, rhythm, choreography -- they can really 

add up in the professional calculations by journalists. And Bush, known to 

have a remarkably short attention span, seems to be well-suited to a medium 

that greatly values style over substance. Like a negative in a developing 

pan, the current president's TV profile is taking shape. Some political 

reporters scoff in private, no doubt, but their on-the-job respect is thick 

as dense smoke.



         <p>Journalists who specialize in critiquing televised images are 

watching closely. The Washington Post's Tom Shales greeted the big speech 

with notable satisfaction at signs of progress: "George W.'s television 

persona is definitely improving. He was relaxed and confident and thereby 

reassuring." Evidently, we're supposed to feel reassured that the president 

is competent, wise and kind -- rather than bumbling, vacuous and greedy -- 

if he exudes relaxation and confidence on TV screens.



         <p>Shales is the most influential critic of television to be read at 

Washington's breakfast tables, and perhaps that stature has inflated his 

sense of omniscience. During the speech, he wrote, Bush "proceeded to make 

himself welcome in the American home." But if such a singular entity as 

"the American home" ever existed, it long ago went the way of Ozzie, 

Harriet and the Beav.



         <p>Plunging ahead to his climax, Shales went on: "Chances are, most 

of those who saw the speech feel much better about Bush this morning than 

they did one second before he began it." Shales concluded: "Bush took the 

oath of office on Jan. 20, but he really became president last night."



         <p>It's one thing to predict, monitor or analyze the public's 

gullibility, and quite another to worsen it by proclaiming your own. The 

words from Shales were delightful for the White House spinners who have 

worked hard to orchestrate the opening performances of the George W. Bush 

presidency.



         <p>And Bush media strategists must be pleased that countless 

journalists -- egged on by network anchors -- have launched a new round of 

exclamations about Bush's ability to confound adversaries who underestimate 

him.



         <p>"This is not an original thought -- he constantly surprises people 

by exceeding expectations," Dan Rather said on CBS after Bush's address to 

Congress. Meanwhile, on ABC, Peter Jennings made the same observation. 

Neither one paused to wonder aloud about whether they weren't simply 

playing their part in a ritual of a president's high jumps over low media 

standards.



         <p>Tom Brokaw made note of cordial relations between President Bush 

and Democratic congressional leaders, then wrapped up NBC's coverage for 

the night by observing: "The times they are a'changin' here in Washington 

in the 21st century." Roll over, Bob Dylan.



         <p>Perhaps there are some constants in American political life. As 

potential counterweights to dubious presidents, the lawmakers at the other 

end of Pennsylvania Avenue have a history of being rather lightweight. "Who 

are they, as bats and night-bogs, askant in the Capitol?" wrote Walt 

Whitman. "Are those really Congressmen?"



         <p>Whitman's haiku-like couplet has stood the test of time. Giving 

undue deference even to a president who lost the national popular vote by 

more than half a million ballots, the present-day loyal opposition provides 

much more loyalty than opposition.



         <p>What's wrong with most media coverage of two-party conflicts and 

accommodations is akin to what's wrong with those two parties themselves: 

The narrowness of outlooks and paucity of wide-ranging debate is 

self-reinforcing. And when the vast majority of media coverage is scarcely 

wider than the range of the Republican and Democratic party establishments, 

the closed loop of public discourse is in mortal danger of choking on its 

own toxic effluents.



         <p>In defense of the media status quo, high-profile journalists are 

apt to insist that they're simply doing their jobs by reporting "the news" 

-- and naturally the most powerful elected officials and their appointees 

make the most newsworthy pronouncements. But that kind of logic makes sense 

for democracy only if we forget that they're all functioning inside 

concentric circles that revolve around big money.



         <p>In the corporate-funded vessels that carry presidents and 

congressional leaders -- as well as network anchors and their colleagues -- 

on mainstream journeys, the process of going along to get along with 

corporate power is routine for getting and keeping their jobs. You won't 

find vehement boat-rockers among them.
