IF IT WERE converted to the headquarters of a major U.S. corporation, would the

Bush White House look any different?

    Certainly its dress code, conventional working hours and businesslike

atmosphere make it compatible with the culture in executive suites of large

companies and less like the more laid-back, intensely political mind set of the

Bill Clinton White House. But do not imagine these are skin-deep differences or

that they don't represent profound new friendliness to corporate interests.

<P>

    Business as usual has taken on a whole new meaning in the government's

conduct of business. If the Bush administration had contracted with General

Electric to manage its environmental policy, it's hard to imagine GE chief Jack

Welch finding less fault with it. Concerns about global warming, greenhouse

gases and glacier melt have been replaced by intense emphasis on oil

exploration and relaxation of environmental regulation.

<P>

    If Welch is betting he won't have to pay for dredging GE-generated PCBs out

of the Hudson River, who can blame him for being encouraged? Anyway, he boldly

sent the president of one of his subsidiaries, the National Broadcasting Co.,

to the New York City Council recently to lobby against PCB dredging. Like

Welch, Vice President Dick Cheney and Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill are in

the mold of men who know what it is to meet a major payroll. Bush himself knows

what it means to lose your shirt in the oil business.

<P>

    Nowhere is the new deference to corporate power more obvious than in the

exquisite politeness of the administration's response to the recent

unpleasantness involving the U.S. plane and crew detained by the Chinese.

<P>

    Anybody who expected a generic Republican outburst of anti-Chinese rhetoric

has been bitterly disappointed. A handful of Republicans in Congress yelled for

boycotts of Chinese toys and sporting goods-a mindless gesture that, if anybody

took it seriously, would leave major corporations such as Wal-Mart stuck with a

lot of unsold inventory. But both Bush and Secretary of State Colin Powell have

behaved with the forbearance of society matrons trying not to notice a dog

dropping floating in a punch bowl.

<P>

    Although unspoken, there is a shrill undertone of concern that this

confrontation could imperil U. S. investments in China or cause rupture of

hopes for American penetration of newly opening Chinese markets.

<P>

    These are causes dear to corporate America and they explain better than

anything the failure of this administration to behave with a bellicosity

typical of many Republican attitudes towards China.

<P>

    But, if Bush's Washington has been remade on the corporate model, he must

still govern using the machinery of the old model, which is unforgiving in its

insistence on the constitutional niceties. Just putting up with Congress has

already required Bush to suffer limitations on his tax cut that would be

regarded as seditious were they carried out within a monarchical corporate

hierarchy.

<P>

    Anyway, the modern corporation, however efficient, is a bloodless and

wretchedly inefficient model of democracy. Obligations to minority shareholders

are honored with more lip service than zeal.

<P>

    Bush's minority shareholders happen to be the more than 51 percent of the

American electorate who didn't vote for him.
