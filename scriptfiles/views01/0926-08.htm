Among the tragedies of Sept 11 was that airports were publicly forewarned as 

long as five years ago about nonexistent security and chose to do nothing. 

Did the profit motive get in the way?



<p>One of the doomed jets took off from Newark Airport, in New Jersey. In 1996, 

the Federal Aviation Administration began investigating a story in the 

Record of Hackensack, New Jersey, in which a reporter easily slipped through 

security at Newark Airport, walked freely around the baggage area, observed 

security guards sleeping at their posts, even made his way onto the tarmac 

and stood with his foot on the tire of an airliner. This story appeared in 

the Record on September 11, 1996. The FAA’s conclusion? Security at Newark 

Airport is lax. Exactly five years later, that fact would be conclusively 

and terribly demonstrated.



<p>Up until now in the United States, airport security has been handled by the 

airlines themselves, which contract with security services, such as 

Huntleigh Corporation, the largest airport security provider in the country. 

Huntleigh also happens to be one of three security contractors at Sea-Tac 

Airport. These agencies pay between $6 and $10 per hour, in most cases do 

not provide any benefits, do not support unionization, and provide what many 

employees and critics agree is inadequate training. In most other countries, 

certainly those in Europe and the Middle East which have had more immediate 

experiences with terrorism, airport security is considered a matter of 

national importance. Security personnel are trained professionals, not 

over-worked minimum-wage earners in Captain Kangaroo jackets.



<p>On Sept. 19, 2001, the Seattle Times reported that a Huntleigh-employed 

security screener named Teuila Tuitele was “sent home” when she showed up 

for work the morning after her comments about poor training and working 

conditions at the airport appeared in the Seattle Sunday Times. Tuitele had 

told the Times that she didn’t feel she had been properly trained, that 

security workers were not rotated to reduce fatigue as stated by company 

policy, and that Huntleigh does not test employees’ vision as required by 

the FAA. Tuitele’s salary, after 11 months, is $8.05 per hour. A Huntleigh 

corporate memo dated Sept. 14 stated that employees could be fired for 

talking to the media, though Huntleigh denies that Tuitele has been fired. A 

Huntleigh representative did not return my phone calls.



<p>The failure of the low-bid system to provide for public security is not a 

surprise to anyone with even a passing familiarity with economics and 

incentives. This would seem not to include most free-market zealots, who 

maintain that privatization is the answer to our problems. In order to 

secure contracts, security companies must under-bid competitors.  Seeking to 

push up stock value and maintain shareholder confidence, airlines and their 

security contractors cut costs, and, as with all corporations, those cuts 

aren’t going to come from the salaries of executives. Rather than eliminate 

costs through low worker pay and poor training, though, the result is that 

those costs have been dumped onto society.  On September 11, our society 

paid dearly.



<p>Over the next months and probably years we’ll be asking ourselves how this 

happened. The major news-media did a fine job of keeping us informed in the 

terrible moments following the attack, but have since slipped back into 

their familiar role of  government cheerleader. The other evening on 

“Nightline,” Ted Koppel got not-so-wildly-divergent views from two men, the 

first of whom advocated striking Afghanistan immediately and powerfully, the 

second of whom advised waiting a bit before striking powerfully. 

Unsurprisingly, there was no room made for discussion of any option other 

than decisive military action. Another idea that you probably will not hear 

discussed on “Nightline” or any of the other mainstream news programs is 

that lax airport security, which was unquestionably one the of the factors 

contributing to the heinous success of the terrorist’s attack, highlights a 

failure of the free market to provide for our safety.
