It is a serial, a real cliffhanger.  It's a fable.  It's about

cavemen.  Cavemen on horseback and in high-tech command centers.  Stone

Age meets Space Age, isn't that what they say?  Vice President Cheney is

in a bunker in a mountain.  Batman had a Batcave.  Osama bin Laden is

like that, like a bat, but he's also a rat, scurrying into his fortified

hole, leaving droppings, a videotape here and there.  I've already heard

songs about it, Country songs and corridas.  I'm sure there are ballads

in Arabic.  



<p>There will be epic poems, folktales.  There are probably lots of

limericks.  There will be serious plays and ridiculous movies.  It's a

religious lesson.  It's a morality play.  It's a pageant.  It's a

costume drama.  They are the Evil-doers.  We are the Evil un-doers. 

Hooray.  Boo, hiss.



<p>We try to follow the narrative.  We post-moderns know what the old

bards knew--there are many narratives.  Al Qaeda, a band of True

Believers from around the world, gather in Talibanland, and with money

from a dozen or a hundred sources storm the castle and citadel of the

Super Power.  The Twin Towers fall and fall and turn inside-out. 

Tolkien may be too tame for our tastes.  



<p>With $200,000 they caused more than $20,000,000,000 damage and another

$20,000,000,000 in subsequent costs.  How's the ROI, the return on their

investment?  What is the multiplier effect?  They lost 19 men who killed

over 3000.  Most of them were from Saudi Arabia, the dead were from at

least 86 countries.  They are all men, the dead are women as well as

men.  They are all fervent Muslims, the dead are of many faiths and no

faith.  How do we calculate the symmetry and asymmetry, how do we

measure the moral equivalence?        



<p>The fire is still burning in lower Manhattan.  (There is a coal mine in

Pennsylvania that has been burning for 40 years.)  There are fires

burning in the hearts of people everywhere.  There is snow on the

mountains in Afghanistan.  "Into the valley of death rode the six

hundred."  (Tennyson, 1853.)  There is major poetry here.  Death from

the sky.  Avenging angels. 

   

<p>What is the story and the glory?  How will the tale be told?  There are

heroes of different cultures and uniforms, of different worldviews and

accents and time zones.  They meet from the opposite ends of the earth,

from Washington, D.C. and London, at the Khyber Pass, for God's sake,

and on CNN and al-Jazeera.  Strike up the band.  



<p>The fighting is taking place where Alexander the Great, the British

Empire and the Soviet Union gave up and went home.  Now, the Western

allies and the Northern Alliance, the United Front, the United Kingdom

and the United States against Al Qaeda, the warlords of the Pentagon and

the clans of the Stans, the tribes and the bribes, against the

guerrillas, criminals, terrorists, fanatics, brigands, holy warriors

all.  It's a melodrama.  It hurts too much to laugh.



<p>This is great material.  There are more than enough mixed metaphors.

There is too much history.  It is Grand Guignol and Greek chorus.  It is

1492 in reverse, from the fall of the Alhambra to breaching the

Pentagon.  It is 661, with the split between Sunnis and Shi'ites still

reverberating.  It is the Old West and the new West.  Wanted: Dead or

Alive.  Saladin meets Paladin.  $25 million on his head, for his head on

a platter or a spike.  We are told, tellingly, Afghanistan is the size

of Texas.  "Don't Mess With Texas."  This will be a musical soon, even

an opera.  I've always liked "The Desert Song" (1926, then three movie

versions).  But that was a love story.  



<p>"In the next war, the dead will be buried in cellophane," Ernest

Hemingway wrote, in a poem, not his war reporting.  What an

old-fashioned idea.  The dead in New York became dust.  An even older

idea.  



<p>It's El Cid, Lawrence of Arabia, Kipling, the Great Game, Marco Polo,

the Desert Mystics.  Take notes for the mid-term exam.  "Poetry is

emotion recollected in tranquility," wrote Wordsworth.  Meanwhile, bombs

are falling, fires are burning.  Christmas is a-comin' and the geese are

getting fat.  People killing people, what do you think of that?  Peace

on earth as a vaudeville routine.  It's in such bad taste, but that's

the name of the game.  Please, hold your applause.  It's not over yet.
