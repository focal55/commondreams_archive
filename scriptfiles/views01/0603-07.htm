We can all breathe a little easier now; Jack Gilroy's in jail.

<P>Jack Gilroy: retired Maine-Endwell teacher, Army veteran, peace activist.

<P>Late last month, Gilroy, along with 25 other enemies of the state, was found guilty in Federal Court in Georgia of criminal trespassing. The criminal operation on which Jack and the others were trespassing is the Western Hemisphere Institute for Security Cooperation, formerly called School of the Americas.

<P>The WHISC is located at Fort Benning, Georgia. It specializes in training officers and non- commissioned officers from countries in Latin America so they can return to their homelands and help their countrymen and women and children become better citizens. Unfortunately, their methods often as not include killing the ones who are not quick learners.

<P>Or they used to. That was when the school was called the SOA. Just because the SOA graduates had to kill a handful of priests and nuns, the odd archbishop or two and several thousand civilians who were probably Communist sympathizers if the truth were known, the school came under attack by bleeding heart liberals, peaceniks and other dangerous subversives.

<P>So the Army did the right thing. It changed the name of the school to the WHISC. And if you believe the Army, it also changed its mission. No more training homicidal slugs such as Roberto d'Aubuisson and the colonels who ordered the killing of those priests and their housekeepers in El Salvador. No siree. The WHISC now instills its students in the Rodney King philosophy: Can't we all just get along? Or so it claims.

<P>Gilroy and about 3,000 others didn't believe the Army, and so last November they marched on Fort Benning to protest the school's continued operation. Jack and some others didn't just march on the school. They marched in. And got arrested. For some, Jack included, it was not the first time. So the judge threw the book at them.

<P>Jack got six months in prison and a $500 fine. Twenty-five others received sentences ranging from probation to one year in prison, and fines ranging from $150 to $3,000.

<P>Jack asked that his sentences begin immediately. The judge obliged. Jack is now in the Muscogee County Jail near Columbus, Ga., awaiting transfer to Allenwood, a minimum security federal penitentiary in Pennsylvania.

<P>Jack will have plenty of distinguished company. Dorothy and Gwen Hennessey of Dubuque, Iowa, also received six-month sentences. Dorothy, 88, and Gwen, 68, are Franciscan nuns. No matter. You can't be too careful.

<P>Jack's friend Charles Liteky, another protester, began serving his time earlier. Liteky was awarded the Medal of Honor for heroism in Vietnam. But, hey, what's he done for us lately?

<P>Meanwhile, a few miles south in Florida, SOA-grad colonels from El Salvador, their hands still stained with the blood of their many victims, bask in well-deserved retirement.

<P>Is this a great country, or what?
