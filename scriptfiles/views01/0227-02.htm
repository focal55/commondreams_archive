POLITICIANS TELL all kinds of lies. There are lies about granting pardons. And then there are lies about cutting taxes.

<P>

<P>As president, Bill Clinton told us he ''did not have sexual relations with that woman, Miss Lewinsky.'' Then it turned out, he did. Because of that lie, and others, there is no reason to believe him now when he says political donations had nothing to do with his decision to pardon fugitive financier Marc Rich.

<P>

<P>As governor, George W. Bush won two major tax cuts for Texas, arguing that they were affordable because of a large surplus. But, as The Wall Street Journal recently reported, the Texas state budget is now so tight, legislators are talking about tapping into a state rainy day fund or even raising taxes. 

<P>

<P>So, why believe Bush now when he promises that his $1.6 trillion, 10-year income tax plan for the country is easily affordable because of a large surplus?

<P>

<P>Hard evidence - not loony speculation - shows such promises are as illusory as the rosy surplus projections upon which they hinge.

<P>

<P>Bush and his tax cuts left Texas in an uncomfortable fiscal pinch. ''We made tax cuts because we thought we had this huge surplus,'' one Texas Republican, Senate Finance Committee Vice Chairman Chris Harris, told the Journal. Harris said if he fully realized the budget pressures ahead, ''I might have voted a little differently on all those tax cuts.'' 

<P>

<P>Governor Paul Cellucci plans on leaving Massachusetts in a similar fiscal pinch, as he moves on to become ambassador to Canada.

<P>

<P>In the Bay State, a slower economy already means lower revenue projections. Over the next four years, the combination of the Cellucci tax cut, together with other approved cuts that are still phasing in, will reduce receipts by $1.8 billion annually.

<P>

<P>The combination, says Michael J. Widmer, president of the Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation, ''will almost certainly guarantee program cuts.''

<P>

<P>As a recent Taxpayers Foundation report points out, this state now confronts a series of major, unavoidable cost increases, especially in the areas of Medicaid and employee health benefits. The state also remains vulnerable to further setbacks in the stock market that could mean substantial increases in the annual pension funding obligation. Massachusetts also faces an annual obligation to increase state aid in order to maintain school spending.

<P>

<P>State spending obligations are analogous to much larger obligations on the federal level. And they play out against the same record of inaccurate long-range surplus predictions.

<P>

<P>Bush already acknowledges as much. The proof is in his desire to propose a budget that requires programs cuts. He knows that is the only way the country can even pretend to afford a $1.6 trillion tax cut.

<P>

<P>In Massachusetts, Democratic leaders did not buy into the tax-cutting lies of a Republican governor. But then, they didn't have to vote on them. Massachusetts voters succumbed to temptation on their own, endorsing the Cellucci-backed tax-cut initiative.

<P>

<P>In general, tax cuts are hard to resist. Like falling in love with the wrong person, they just feel good. So, emotion wins out over logic and passion prevails over prudence.

<P>

<P>In Washington, surplus projections plus supportive testimony from Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank, made Republicans and Democrats hot with tax-cutting passion. Too quickly, Bush's campaign promise to cut taxes became everyone's shared agenda.

<P>

<P>Congressional Democrats are now trying to reshape the debate around the size of the tax cut, how to get it to the neediest people, and how to fashion it in a way that best stimulates the economy. But, for the most part, they are still buying into Bush's basic premise - that you can significantly reduce taxes, maintain meaningful debt reduction, and keep popular programs, on the basis of optimistic surplus projections.

<P>

<P>As he pitches his plan, the president is relying on ever higher budget surplus projections, by way of a ''new'' method of calculating. As it listens to him, the nation should think about truth and consequences.

<P>

<P>When it comes to the truth about his pardons, Clinton has to live with his conscience.  In an even more personal way, we all have to live with the true consequences of Bush's proposed tax cuts.
