ANOTHER SCHOOL shooting and the gun-control advocates and opponents are again on opposite banks of the river of blood. The White House has turned its back on the riddled bodies floating downstream as the other side shouts and points down  at the river, dismissed as village idiots.

<P>

<P>After Columbine and the Million Mom March, it seemed that the forces for more sane gun restrictions were gaining strength in Congress. Now, with President Bush acting as a courtier to the National Rifle Association, there is  suddenly no debate at all.

<P>

<P>After three school shootings in his first two months in office which killed  two students and wounded 20 people, Bush has reduced the problem to a vague wish for values.

<P>

<P>''When America teaches her children right from wrong and teaches  values that respect life in our country, our country will be better off,'' Bush  said. He said nothing about guns.

<P>

<P>Bush's education secretary, Rod Paige, said America's children need  ''character education.''  As for guns, Paige said, ''We think just focusing on guns  is much too narrow; it's beyond guns. The guns may be the instrument of the  violence, but they're not the cause of the violence.''

<P>

<P>Attorney General John Ashcroft said that  violent video games and violent media fuel an ''ethic of violence.'' But when it  came to the most violent object in America - a gun - Ashcroft said, ''Gun laws ... alone aren't going to solve the problem.''

<P>

<P>The Bush strategy of treating school shootings as if a gun was never fired is working. The media have been diverted into ''values'' investigations on  bullying or tattling. Gun-control Democrats have nearly censored themselves for fear of being written off as village idiots. Virtually no major Democrat called for a renewed debate on gun control after Santee.

<P>

<P>This cannot possibly last. The very thing that is working for Bush now ultimately will fail. His denial about guns today will result in more school  shootings tomorrow. Deep down, Americans know this. The majority of Americans  want tighter gun restrictions. The question is whether gun control advocates can tap  into that feeling before another Columbine.

<P>

<P>In the spirit of having nothing to lose - village idiots usually have nothing  to lose - gun control forces should call Bush's bluff. Give him credit, tons of  credit, on the things they can. Give him so much credit that if Bush does not  respond with humble compromise, he will be exposed as a heartless slave of the NRA.

<P>

<P>Tell Bush that, yes, we agree. Values do matter. Yes, Mr. Ashcroft, we're with you  about video games and the media. So do your job. Work with Congress to establish  strict standards for violent video games. Demand that guns and bloody bodies  cannot appear on early-evening prime time television. Tell the networks to get  rid of violent ads for first-run movies during the Super Bowl.

<P>

<P>Mr. Bush, you are absolutely right when you say, ''We all have a duty to watch for  and report troubling signs.'' So take back that $1.6  trillion tax cut meant to boost sales at strip malls and instead spend it on  reducing class size. Spend it on expanding high school extra-curricular  activities.

<P>

<P>Mr. President, you say, ''My job is to say to the moms and dads of America,  `Your most important job is to love your children with all your heart and all  your soul.'''

<P>

<P>What gun control advocate would disagree? So use your power to make that job easier. Take the $1.6 trillion and instead of giving Americans a chance to buy more TVs to baby-sit their kids, spend it on a for-real, paid  family leave such as the one they have in Western Europe, not this jive American leave  which only grants you the right to slash your family's income in half and risk  demotion when you go back to work. 

<P>

<P>See, Mr. President, we have some common ground. There is an ''ethic of  violence.'' As you say, when someone takes a gun and shoots someone it is an ''act  of cowardice.''

<P>

<P>But now, Mr. President, we came your way on values, what about  the guns? You say <i>our </i>most important job as moms and dads is to love <i>our</i> children.

<P>

<P>Mr. President, what is <i>your </i>most important job? To help the moms and dads, or the NRA?
