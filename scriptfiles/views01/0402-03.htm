What better time than now to revive the idea of universal health

care? There's a huge budget surplus. Meanwhile, the number of Americans

lacking health insurance continues to rise (now almost 43 million, up

from 38 million 10 years ago). And those who have it are paying more than

ever in co-payments, deductibles and premiums. As the economy sinks,

working families will have an even harder time. If they lose their jobs,

their health insurance may disappear.

<p>Yet nobody in Washington is talking about universal health care.

President Bush wants to use the bulk of the surplus for a whopping tax

cut, mostly for the rich. If there's any money left, he'd accept a $2,000

tax credit against the cost of family health insurance. But this wouldn't

be much help to the typical middle-income family that now pays more than

$6,000 a year to guarantee its health care. Even with the tax credit

figured in, health insurance would still take a whopping 10% to 15% out

of this family's annual income. And the credit would be of almost no use

to families that can't afford health insurance to begin with. The

Congressional Budget Office recently concluded that a tax credit would

have to be more than twice as large as the one Bush is mentioning in

order to get most of them insured.

<p>What about the Democrats--the party that first championed universal

health care? They don't even want to utter the words "universal health

care" because they still believe Bill and Hillary Clinton's ill-fated

plan of 1994 was responsible for the Republican takeover of Congress

later that year. Democrats don't want to revive memories of that plan for

fear of losing electoral support in 2002.

<p>Those fears are misplaced. The Clinton health care plan sank because

it was too complicated for the public to understand, which made it a

perfect foil for right-wing demagogues. In fact, the public supported the

idea of universal health care. Polls taken in late 1993 and early 1994

showed a majority listing "universal health care" as America's most

important unmet need. And a public that wanted universal health care

seven years ago is almost certain to want it now, as health care bills

skyrocket.

<p>Another reason Democrats don't want to talk about universal health

care is that they've adopted the old-time Republican religion of fiscal

austerity. This gospel won't allow spending of the magnitude required to

insure all Americans. Instead, congressional Democrats say the budget

surplus should be divided into thirds. One-third would be used to

eliminate the federal debt and another third for a tax cut more modest

than George W. is proposing. Only the last third would be used for

additional spending.

<p>If today's Democrats had their way, they say they'd spend a bit more

on Medicaid for the very poor and expanded health insurance for children

not quite poor enough to qualify. But this would still leave a huge

health gap. The current children's health insurance program reaches only

about one-third of the 9 million children already eligible for it--an

administrative problem that won't be corrected merely by putting more

money into the program. Anything less than universal access leaves out

too many families.

<p>It's a matter of simple priorities. There's no more reason to use the

surplus to pay down the federal debt than to use it on a big tax cut for

the wealthy. Give all Americans affordable health care instead. Yes, it's

true that lowering the debt reduces federal borrowing costs, but so what?

As John Maynard Keynes pointed out 60 years ago, public indebtedness per

se isn't a problem. The underlying question is what the public debt is

used for. If the benefits to the public exceed the costs of borrowing

from the public, it would be silly not to borrow. And with health care

costs soaring and coverage declining, the benefits of universal health

care are very high.

<p>Bill Clinton proposed his plan for universal health care when the

nation was deeper in debt than it is now and faced annual deficits of

almost $300 billion a year for as far as the eye could see. Now we have a

budget surplus even Alan Greenspan thinks is too big, and working

families need affordable health care more than ever. You don't have to be

a rocket scientist--or even a politician--to figure out what has to be

done.
