<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->Great presidential exits. Let&#0039;s see...  there&#0039;s Dwight Eisenhower warning about the growing danger from the military-industrial complex. Or, there&#0039;s Bill and Hillary Clinton acting as if they were entitled to choose all three doors on <i>Let&#0039;s Make A Deal</i> any day.

<p>

The last time the White House experienced this level of grabbing and fleeing, it was being burned by the British. <p>

Even a departing Richard Nixon, when he gave his famous farewell wave prior to boarding the presidential helicopter, was not seen to have a soup tureen in each hand. <p>

There is no doubt that if Bill Clinton were to join Jimmy Carter at Habitat For Humanity, he would do it not to house the homeless but to get a free bandsaw from Mary Steenburgen and Ted Danson.<p>

And we all know that it will do no good for George W. to inform us that &quot;it&#0039;s important for all the facts to be laid out on the table&quot; since the Clintons have taken the table with them. (Personally, I expected reports of incessant jack-hammering during the wee hours of Jan. 19, with America awakening on Inauguration Day to find the Truman Balcony perched atop West 57th Street and the Clintons covered in plaster but admitting only to a possible cataloguing error.) 

<p>

Yes, Bill and Hillary continue to display a level of taste in furnishing their assorted dwellings that makes Graceland look like the Louvre by comparison. And I will leave it to the humorless to take seriously Hillary&#0039;s solemn vow regarding disputed gifts, that she and her hubby &quot;will certainly honor the intention of the donor&quot;... a fact already known to Denise Rich, James Riady and felons the world over.

<p>

Now some say that the only difference between the Clintons leaving the White House and the Visigoths leaving Rome was that the Clintons had a note from the curator. But here are a few other recent events we all might take a minute to find just as repugnant:<p>

Attorney General John Ashcroft, having anointed his head with a squirt of Pam, now turning his attention to banning fetal tissue research, so that diabetics and Alzheimer&#0039;s sufferers can die just as quickly and painfully as Jesus Our King intended them to.<p>

Bob Torricelli being allowed in public life.<p>

The fact that in 1993, Dick Cheney, now the most powerful and respected man in Washington, went scuttling over to the Persian Gulf just as fast as his ventrically-challenged ticker would allow, to cash in on his former job as secretary of defense. Am I the only one who would like to see him give a few million dollars of his oil company stock options to the families of the veterans whose deaths led to his profits?<p>

The opening of a restaurant in Washington called The Caucus Room that caters <i>exclusively to lobbyists</i> (though how a health code which normally seeks to exterminate vermin would allow them to sit at tables and dine is beyond me). It is owned by Haley Barbour, last seen trying to sneak a $50 billion dollar tax break for the tobacco industry into law, and Tom Boggs, the brother of Cokie Roberts. Something you may want to remember during the next roundtable discussion about campaign finance reform on <i>This Week.</i><p>

Curt Weldon even being allowed to open his mouth when debate begins on funding the Osprey.

<p>

The Bush brothers&#0039; transcendental arrogance on election night. To be that sure you did not lose Florida, you either had total confidence in the power of your message of inclusion <i>or</i> total confidence that every black in the state would have to endure construction detours and police-run-ID-checks before using a voting machine that last worked successfully when the Stutz Bearcat was a late model car <i>or</i> total confidence that you were going to steal the vote regardless.

<p>

Terry McAuliffe, for whom the term <i>conflict of interest</i> refers to three piles of money and only two hands, being named head of the DNC.<p>

Any talk of a Bush mandate.<p>

Any talk of Al Gore running again.

<p>

And as for Bill Clinton, look at it this way. Two weeks after occupying the most powerful office on the planet, he was speaking at an <i>annual junk-bond conference! </i>Can appearances at tractor pulls and monster truck rallies be far behind?

<p>

<i>Jerry Long  and his brother Joe are known as the satirists the Sturdy Beggars.</i>
