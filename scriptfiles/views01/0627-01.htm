Biotechnology companies and even some scientists argue that we need

genetically modified seeds to feed the world and to protect the Earth

from chemicals. Their arguments feel eerily familiar.

<p>Thirty years ago, I wrote "Diet for a Small Planet" for one reason. As

a researcher buried in the UC Berkeley agricultural library, I was

stunned to learn that the experts -- equivalent to the biotech proponents

of today -- were wrong. They were telling us we'd reached the Earth's

limits to feed ourselves, but in fact there was more than enough food for

us all.

<p>Hunger, I learned, is the result of economic "givens" we ourselves

have created, assumptions and structures that actively generate scarcity

from plenty. Today this is more, not less, true.

<p>Throughout history, ruminants had served humans by turning grasses and

other "inedibles" into high-grade protein. They were our four-legged

protein factories. But once we began feeding livestock from cropland that

could grow edible food, we began to convert ruminants into our protein

disposals. Only a small fraction of the nutrients fed to animals return

to us in meat; the rest animals use largely for energy or they excrete.

Thirty years ago, one-third of the world's grain was going to livestock;

today it is closer to one-half. And now we're mastering the same

disappearing trick with the world's fish supply. By feeding fish to fish,

again, we're reducing the potential supply.

<p>We're shrinking the world's food supply for one reason: The hundreds

of millions of people who go hungry cannot create a sufficient "market

demand" for the fruits of the Earth. So more and more of it flows into

the mouths of livestock, which convert it into what the better-off can

afford. Corn becomes filet mignon. Sardines become salmon.

<p>Enter biotechnology. While its supporters claim that seed

biotechnology methods are "safe" and "precise," other scientists strongly

refute that, as they do claims that biotech crops have actually reduced

pesticide use.

<p>But this very debate is in some ways part of the problem. It is a

tragic distraction our planet cannot afford.

<p>We're still asking the wrong question. Not only is there already

enough food in the world, but as long as we are only talking about

food -- how best to produce it -- we'll never end hunger or create the

communities and food safety we want.

<p>We must ask instead: How do we build communities in tune with nature's

wisdom in which no one, anywhere, has to worry about putting food -- safe,

healthy food -- on the table? Asking this question takes us far beyond

food. It takes us to the heart of democracy itself, to whose voices are

heard in matters of land, seeds, credit, employment, trade and food

safety.

<p>The problem is, this question cannot be addressed by scientists or by

any private entity, including even the most high-minded corporation. Only

citizens can answer it, through public debate and the resulting

accountable institutions that come from our engagement.

<p>Where are the channels for public discussion and where are the

accountable polities?

<p>Increasingly, public discussion about food and hunger is framed by

advertising by multinational corporations that control not only food

processing and distribution but farm inputs and seed patents.

<p>Two years ago, the seven leading biotech companies, including

Monsanto, teamed up under the neutral-sounding Council for Biotechnology

Information and are spending millions to, for example, blanket us with

full-page newspaper ads about biotech's virtues.

<p>Government institutions are becoming ever more beholden to these

corporations than to their citizens. Nowhere is this more obvious than in

decisions regarding biotechnology--whether it's the approval or patenting

of biotech seeds and foods without public input or the rejection of

mandatory labeling of biotech foods despite broad public demand for it.

<p>The absence of genuine democratic dialogue and accountable government

is a prime reason most people remain blind to the many breakthroughs in

the last 30 years that demonstrate we can grow abundant, healthy food and

also protect the Earth.

<p>Hunger is not caused by a scarcity of food but by a scarcity of

democracy. Thus it can never be solved by new technologies, even if they

were to be proved "safe." It can only be solved as citizens build

democracies in which government is accountable to them, not private

corporate entities.
