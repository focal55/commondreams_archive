U.S. opposes plan for financing of clean energy over fossil fuel; U.S. threat to international tribunal worries Europe; Russia upset by U.S. missile test.

<P>



   On the eve of President Bush's second trip to Europe, the weekend's headlines suggest an administration hell-bent on a go-it-alone foreign policy bound to anger and alienate longstanding friends and former adversaries. Examples abound:

<P>&nbsp;

<LI TYPE=SQUARE>&nbsp;This week, at a summit meeting to be attended by President Bush in Genoa, Italy, a task force of the group of the world's eight most advanced nations, the G-8, will present a report reportedly calling on countries to ``remove incentives and other supports for environmentally harmful energy technologies.'' Rather than pushing development projects that require heavy use of fossil fuels, wealthy nations should help poor countries develop renewable energy resources, the report says.

<P>



   A sensible proposal? Not according to the Bush administration, which says the marketplace should be left alone to determine the pace of the changeover from fossil fuels to clean energy. But that has been the approach, and it has done nothing to curtail global warming and other environmental damage, so why continue it? That's what Europeans leaders will want to know. They probably won't hear the real answer -- that a move to clean energy would hurt the administration's corporate friends whose business is selling power plants, pipelines and drilling equipment to the Third World.

</B></FONT>

<P>&nbsp;

<LI TYPE=SQUARE>&nbsp;The United States is opposing efforts by the 15 members of the European Union to establish a permanent International Criminal Court to try war criminals, genocide perpetrators and those accused of crimes against humanity. You would think that a nation that each year grades every country except itself on human-rights performance would be out front leading the effort to create a tribunal to bring world-class criminals to justice.

<P>



   Instead, according to press reports, ``Members of the European Union and other nations are stepping up efforts to dissuade the United States from going beyond opposition to an active campaign to wreck'' the proposed court. Why would the United States do that? The official explanation is that such a court could lead to unfair prosecutions of American soldiers or officials abroad.

<P>



   Yet European nations, which have thousands of peacekeeping troops all over the world don't have such worries. The best hypothesis is that the United States gets away with wielding its power in violation of international law, as in the invasions of Panama and Grenada and the food and medicine components of the embargo of Cuba. The United States doesn't want anyone, especially an impartial international court, to curtail its power.

</B></FONT>

<P>&nbsp;

<LI TYPE=SQUARE>&nbsp;As part of a program to build an anti-ballistic-missile shield, the United States has successfully tested a missile. The rapid development of this system, which is opposed by most U.S. allies, as well as Russia and China, is on a collision course with the ABM treaty with Russia. The shield is supposed to intercept missiles that might be launched by rogue states.

<P>



   But there are myriad other ways a lunatic state willing to withstand U.S. retaliation could deliver a weapon of mass destruction. Why enrage a wounded Russian bear to block a bunch of cockroaches that could still get in through the cracks? In the short run, the answer might be the huge profits American companies will reap from research and development. In the long run, the real objective might be to make the United States able to exercise its will in the world without having to worry about the objections of minor or even major nuclear powers. Building a nuclear shield and torpedoing an international criminal court might well seek the same objective: unchecked power. 

<P>



   How will the world react to this U.S. challenge?
