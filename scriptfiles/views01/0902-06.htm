<i>"It seems to me that our three basic needs, for food and security 
and love, are so mixed and mingled and entwined that we cannot 
straightly think of one without the others. So it happens that when I 
write of hunger, I am really writing about love and the hunger for it, 
and warmth and the love of it and the hunger for it; and then the 
warmth and richness and fine reality of hunger satisfied; and it is all 
one."</i><br>
--M. F. K. Fisher, The Art of Eating

<p>I once read an essay about the Holocaust that really struck me: in 
it the author made the point that when the Nazis came to power 
some people worried, some people protested, but for the majority 
of the German people life went on as before. When Kristallnacht 
happened – some people worried, some protested, but for the 
majority – life went on as before. And when the Camps opened, 
when the Holocaust began, the German people clung fast to their 
willful ignorance and indifference. They went to work or to school or 
into the military. They came home to spend time with their families. 
They went to the movies and played sports. They had picnics and 
barbecues – they sat around their tables every night sharing food 
and fellowship. What did they talk about over dinner? In the midst 
of Genocide, of terrible violence being committed all around them 
and in their names – they laughed and cried, kissed their children, 
made love to their husbands and wives, and simply went on with 
life. And as much as this essay struck me when I read it, I never 
understood it until I began to work on Iraq.

<p>What did you talk about over dinner last night?

<p>August 6th, 2001 was the 11th anniversary of the U.S.-led, 
international sanctions against Iraq. In commemoration and protest 
of the ongoing blockade, myself and 12 others began an action 
called, “Breaking Ranks: A Fast to End the Siege of Iraq.” The fast 
is being sponsored by Voices in the Wilderness, the same 
organization I illegally traveled to Iraq with two years ago, taking 
medicine and toys to hospitals there in direct violation of U.S. law. 
We are fasting from food for 40 days, from August 6th until 
September 14th, and demonstrating every day in front of the U.S. 
Mission to the United Nations in New York City. Kathy Kelly, co-
founder of Voices, and twice nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize, 
explains our purpose well, “We are trying to encourage the member 
states of the UN to ‘break ranks’ with the U.S. in its insistence on 
endless sanctions for Iraq. The more ‘smart’ they try to make the 
sanctions, the more adept they are at killing the Iraqi people.” And 
to that I would add that I am trying to encourage my fellow 
Americans to break ranks with our government as well, and to 
begin seeing the Iraqi people as we see ourselves. Gandhi once 
said that “whenever there is distress which one cannot remove, one 
must fast and pray.” So I am fasting and praying: for the people of 
Iraq, for the people of America, and for myself.

<p>I am so sick of this war, as I am sick of all the excuses made by 
all of the people responsible for keeping it going. I am sick of 
having to explain how a country two-thirds the size of Texas with a 
GDP of roughly 6 billion dollars a year is not a threat to the United 
States of America. In fact, quite the opposite – we have bombed 
Iraq at will and with absolute impunity for over a decade. Our 
“defense” budget alone is 50 times larger than Iraq’s entire 
economy. I am sick of having to repeat over and over again the 
findings of reports repeatedly issued by OIP, or UNICEF, or the 
FAO, or the WHO, or the International Red Cross – all 
documenting the numerous ways sanctions have ravaged and 
continue to ravage the Iraqi people. I am sick of having to explain, 
as if to small children, that collective punishment is illegal and 
immoral, and that the forcible impoverishment of an entire nation, 
leading to the excess deaths of hundreds of thousands of its 
citizens is itself a crime against humanity – and, more than that, a 
crime against God.

<p>Most of all, I’m tired of the cynical way our government continues 
to posture itself for short-term political gain to the total disregard, 
and at the total expense, of the Iraqi people. Such as with this 
recent nonsense over “smart” sanctions. “Smart” sanctions may 
make it easier for suppliers outside of Iraq to ship consumer goods 
there, but who in Iraq will be able to afford them? Sanctions have 
already devastated Iraq’s economy, causing hyperinflation, chronic 
unemployment, and the collapse of critical civilian infrastructures – 
including the public health care and educational systems – 
resulting in the virtual destruction of Iraq’s once prosperous middle 
class; resulting in the excess deaths of perhaps well over 
1,000,000 people in all. Until we lift sanctions, once and for all, Iraq 
cannot even begin the process of rebuilding its economy.

<p>When the Allied forces won WW II, and liberated Belson, 
Buchenwald, Auschwitz, Dachau, and all the Camps – the world 
was horrified. We asked ourselves, “how could this have 
happened?” We asked ourselves, “where were the good Germans?” 
Today I am fasting in solidarity with the people of Iraq, who have 
suffered so much in this ongoing war of bombings and blockade, 
and I am asking, “how could this have happened?” I am fasting in 
atonement for my failure to stop their slaughter, and for my sins as 
a citizen of the nation that is killing them. And I am fasting for my 
fellow Americans, for our failure to recognize the spirit of God 
present in all the peoples of Iraq. I am fasting for our failure to see 
that their humanity is equal to our humanity. I am fasting for our 
failure to feel the injustice of their suffering, or the offense of our 
role in creating and maintaining that suffering. I am fasting for the 
good Americans who refuse to see the evil they commit; for the 
good Americans who refuse to see the evil they permit – and for 
those who having seen it refuse to do much of anything to end it.

<p>God, I am so hungry for peace.

<p>In Arabic, when we see a table filled with sumptuous food, or an 
exceptionally pretty face, we say “ma’shallah,” which means “what 
God has willed.” We also say it when someone dies. It’s an 
exclamation that God’s Will is bountiful, and that His Creation is 
beautiful, even in death. 

<p>I look at our country today and wonder that we have been granted 
so much wealth, so much material bounty, privilege, and power. I 
look at our country and wonder that we can create so much pain, 
kill with such casual and cynical disregard, and remain so 
seemingly untouched by it – untouched within ourselves as within 
our common lives with one another. And all I can think is, 
ma’shallah, and wonder what it will take to make us see the bounty 
of God in the children we’ll kill today by allowing this war to 
continue. Is it really so much to demand that our government allow 
the children of Iraq a chance to live?
