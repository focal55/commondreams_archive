<i>"People of the same trade seldom meet

together, even for merriment and diversion,

but the conversation ends in a conspiracy

against the public . . ."</i> So wrote Adam Smith

more than two centuries ago, and it is equally

true today.



<p>Quebec City is now host to numerous

meetings of these "people of the same trade" -

- the businesspeople who have access to the

secret text of the "Free Trade Area of the

Americas." The fact that the heads of major

corporations such as Merck and IBM can read

the draft of the agreement, while the press and

the public are kept in the dark, speaks volumes

about what is being negotiated.



<p>With the enthusiastic support of the

Bush administration, leaders of 34 nations are

now gathering in Quebec to discuss the

FTAA. The name of this treaty is misleading:

it is not primarily about "free trade." In fact,

this agreement will almost certainly strengthen

some of the most expensive, economically

wasteful, and (in the case of life-saving

pharmaceuticals) deadly forms of

protectionism. These are the patents,

copyrights, and other monopolies commonly

grouped under "intellectual property rights."



<p>While tariffs rarely increase the price

of a good by more than 20 or 25 percent,

patent protected prices can be ten or twenty

times the competitive price. One of the main

purposes of these "free trade" agreements is to

expand this lucrative form of protectionism

across international borders.



<p>Brazil has already run into trouble in

the World Trade Organization for its laws

dealing with the manufacture and import of

generic AIDS drugs. These laws have formed

an important part of Brazil's remarkably

successful program for treating AIDS. Brazil

has provided "triple-therapy" drugs -- the

same ones that cost $12,000 a year to treat

people here, but can be produced for as little

as $500.



<p>Generic AIDS drugs have enabled

Brazil to provide treatment to almost all who

need it, cutting the death rate from AIDS in

half. But Washington is currently challenging

Brazil at the WTO, contesting part of the

Brazilian law that allows for the manufacture

and import of these generic drugs.



<p>Agreements like the FTAA also

expand protections for foreign investors,

giving them rights that they would not be able

to win in their home countries. There was a

little-noticed provision in NAFTA that

allowed foreign investors to sue governments

for regulations that infringed on their potential

profits. This has turned out to be an

environmental nightmare.



<p>For example, the US- based Ethyl

corporation (the one that brought us the lead

in leaded gasoline) brought a complaint

against the Canadian government in 1997. For

public health reasons, Canada had prohibited

the import of another potentially dangerous

gasoline additive known as MMT.



<p>This additive was effectively banned in

the United States. But the fear of losing the

NAFTA lawsuit was enough for Canada to

repeal its law, and pay $13 million dollars in

damages to Ethyl.



<p>Now imagine extending these NAFTA

provisions to 31 more countries and you can

see why environmental organizations are

adamantly opposed to the FTAA. They're not

the only ones. Workers in the United States,

Canada, and Mexico have now had seven

years of experience with NAFTA -- the

FTAA's pilot program -- and it hasn't exactly

turned out to be the "win-win" deal that they

were promised.



<p>For the United States, the main

problem has been the loss of relatively better

paying manufacturing jobs, and the downward

pressure on wages as companies move or

threaten to move south. Canada has also lost a

good part of its manufacturing sector, and

income inequality has worsened significantly.

Mexico has seen declining real wages for its

workers, as well as falling income for the self-

employed (a much larger part of the labor

force than it is here).



<p>For Latin America as a whole, the last

two decades of "free trade" have been an

economic train wreck. Income per person has

grown about 7 percent over the last 20 years,

as compared with 75 percent in the previous

two decades.



<p>In Quebec a "wall of shame" -- as

press reports have described it -- was

constructed to keep protesters away from the

meeting. Three miles of chain link fence and

concrete abutments were supposed to

compensate for the meetings' lack of

legitimacy among the populace.



<p>The WTO and NAFTA are the product

of a decades-long effort to rewrite the rules of

international commerce in ways that ignore

the needs of most of humanity, as well as our

natural environment. But humanity is catching

up, and has learned some lessons. The

misnamed "Free Trade Area of the Americas"

will not withstand public scrutiny.
