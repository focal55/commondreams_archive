IT IS ironic that my most treasured

        Christmas moments have come in a largely Muslim country. <p>It

        is December 1998 and after an intense and illegal bombing

        campaign at the very beginning of Ramadan, we have spent

        a week with children in Baghdad learning to sing &#147;We

        Shall Overcome&#148; in Arabic. The sweet voices of those

        children sustain me to this day. </p>

        <p>It is December 1999, and in a particularly run-down

        area of Basra, a little boy pulls a milk crate by a

        frayed rope. Inside the crate, bundled in a muddied,

        ragged blanket, an obviously malnourished baby gazes

        calmly at me, undisturbed by the flies that surround him.

        This is a nativity under siege. That child's innocent,

        suffering gaze, drives me to this day. </p>

        <p>Each Sunday in the Christian season of Advent, church

        goers anticipate arrival of the innocent one, born into

        impossible poverty, who will bring forth justice for the

        poor, liberty for captives, sight for the blind. &#147;O

        come, O come, Emmanuel&#148; is sung in churches

        worldwide. I hear the tune now and feel haunted. </p>

        <p>A modern-day Herod, deadly, vengeful and reckless,

        pursues the children of Iraq. Hundreds of thousands of

        innocent people have already been slaughtered in 11 long

        years of the most devastating siege in modern history.

        Instead of confronting the failures of this policy, the

        US seems to be gearing up to compound them with the

        greatest failure of all: war. </p>

        <p>In hospitals, schools, mosques, churches and homes,

        people here ask us why the American people want to punish

        them even more. For 11 years they've been told that

        sanctions were a more &#147;peaceful&#148; alternative to

        open warfare. Now they're being told that war is the

        solution to the suffering caused by sanctions. It would

        seem that the message from the US to the Iraqi people is

        in a twisted way at least consistent; and that is to

        please remember that they're being killed with the very

        best of intentions. </p>

        <p>But the truth is that war is not peace. We must not

        allow ourselves to be governed by a cruel and merciless

        world order that relies on siege and warfare to

        accomplish goals that violate human rights and

        international law. Around the world, people of conscience

        must begin to non-violently resist and challenge the

        movement towards intensified warfare with actions

        commensurate to the crimes being committed and

        threatened. </p>

        <p>The barriers to peace may seem overwhelming, yet hope

        springs forth from the most surprising of places. Hope

        lives in the forgiveness shown by Umm Hassan, a young

        Iraqi mother I met last year. Moments after her child

        died for lack of an antibiotic, she murmured: &#147;I

        pray this will never happen to a mother in your

        country.&#148; Hope lives in Amber Amudson, a young

        American mother whose husband, Craig, was killed in the

        attack on the Pentagon on Sept. 11. Amber helped lead a

        walk for peace from Washington DC to New York City

        earlier this month, and she wrote to President Bush:

        &#147;If you choose to respond to this incomprehensible

        brutality by perpetuating violence against other innocent

        human beings, you may not do so in the name of justice

        for my husband.... find the courage to respond to this

        incomprehensible tragedy by breaking the cycle of

        violence.&#148; </p>

        <p>It is Christmas 2001, and we are in Basra again,

        visiting the families we came to love when we lived with

        them two summers ago. Then, we tried to understand the

        effect of sanctions by learning what it was like to live

        without electricity for 14 hours per day in 49-degree

        heat, to share meals made from meagre rations, and to be

        cut off from communication with the rest of the world.

        Today, we're cherishing the hope of peace and pledging to

        defy the call to war. </p>

        <p>Four days ago, we visited Mar Yusuf Church in Mosul,

        which was hit by a US bomb in 1991, killing four guests

        at the church and severely burning one of the priests.

        The damage has long since been repaired, and inside

        stands the most beautiful of Christmas trees. </p>

        <p>Riad Hamza dresses up as Father Christmas every year

        to pass presents out to the children. He made the tree

        for them as well &#151; fashioning the ornaments from

        cigarette and matchboxes wrapped in brightly coloured

        paper and ribbons. He made the tree branches from

        shredded rice bags dyed a deep green. &#147;Here in

        Iraq,&#148; Riad told me, &#147;we make something from

        nothing &#151; especially the peace.&#148; And isn't that

        the most precious gift of all? </p>
