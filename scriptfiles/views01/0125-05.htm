BECAUSE I have expressed embarrassment at some of my fellow 

Democrats' whining, scapegoating vilification of Ralph Nader, I continue to 

take a ration of you-know-what from those self-same hardheads.

<P>  Never mind that I voted for Al Gore and urged readers to do the same. To 

hear the complaints, you'd think Nader and his supporters donned machine guns 

and ammo belts and held Gore captive in some remote Montana sweat lodge 

throughout the presidential campaign.

</P>

<P>  Instead, the 66-year-old consumer/labor/human rights activist merely 

exercised his right as a citizen of the United States to run for president.

</P>

<P>  Earlier this week in The Chronicle's fine Open Forum spot, one of the Nader 

blamers really uncorked on Ralph and the Green Party that backed him. As I was 

revving up to argue with the guy -- lawyer and Demo campaigner Marc Slavin -- 

a far more qualified person beat me to it.

</P>

<P>  Lynn Rigney Schott is a Green who worked for Nader. A Bay Area native, she 

teaches high school English in Kettle Falls, Wash., 85 miles north of Spokane. 

The last few weeks, Schott has been here taking care of her very ill dad (a 

dear pal of mine). But she had time to read the paper and to pen her own 

essays. Herewith, excerpts from her latest. I could not put it any better:

</P>

<P>  "Marc Slavin has a lot of nerve blaming Greens for failing to get their 

message out or to substantially engage their potential allies among 

disenfranchised communities on the left. Real influence is impossible without 

money and access, two of Nader's primary issues. Greens attempted to enter the 

so-called dialogue -- that is, the conversation framed and limited by the two 

major parties -- but were denied access to the main forum: the debates and the 

excessively expensive, corporate-controlled TV time.

</P>

<P>  "It is Democratic business-as-usual to say arrogantly that real grass-roots 

reform must stay off the grass until it has the corporate sponsorship to be 

ready for prime-time debate status.

</P>

<P>  "Contrary to Slavin's claim, politics is not a game. And politics based 

solely on strategy, devoid of idealism, is relegated to the election cycle 

with its fund-raisers, pollsters, handlers, its cynical rhetoric and jockeying 

for power. It is the Democrats who refused the dialogue the Greens proposed; 

now they need a scapegoat for their own inept, unprincipled campaign in the 

wake of the Republican theft of the presidency.

</P>

<P>  "The Nader candidacy was not aimed at Al Gore. It was designed to educate 

the public about crucial, complex issues -- the World Trade Organization and 

the myth of free trade, campaign finance reform, health care, the environment, 

social justice, poverty, education, human rights, corporate domination -- 

issues the Democratic Party refuses to confront honestly. Any public awareness 

of these issues today is the result of grass-roots commitment and activism on 

the part of Greens and other dedicated organizations.

</P>

<P>  "The Greens I know are not members of Slavin's 'elite'; they are determined 

reformers who work in health clinics, women's shelters, schools and 

environmental groups. They protest in Fort Benning, Los Angeles, Seattle, 

Washington D.C., and Chiapas. They are tireless advocates for the very people 

the Democratic Party has left behind.

</P>

<P>  "I'd advise Slavin and those like him to take another cold shower and let 

the Greens know when you're ready for that 'voluntary' conversation. (We tried 

to volunteer but we were turned away at the door.)

</P>

<P>  "Also, I continue to wonder why the Greens are expected to do all the 

compromising. Why don't the Democrats see us as potential allies? Think about 

it in the shower, Mr. Slavin, and save your venom for George W. Bush. While 

you're at it, put your energy behind your principles: See you in the streets."
