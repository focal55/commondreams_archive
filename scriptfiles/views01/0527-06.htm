Well, times change.

<p>I am thinking now about the price of electricity. The new Republican

administration in Washington is pretty clear on this: California and the

West will pay the going rate, whatever.

<p>Updated for the 21st century, the GOP platform has a whole different

idea of the "public interest," it seems. Correct me if I'm wrong, but

this administration sees a higher duty now. Our free market system is

under attack. Government must fight the menace of creeping socialism, the

toll be damned. "We shall fight in the fields and in the streets, we

shall fight in the hills, we shall never surrender," Dick Cheney

declared. Or was that the other conservative, Winston Churchill?

<p>Doesn't matter. The thinking is the same.

<p>Temporary price caps on energy will do nothing for supply and demand,

we're told. Of course not. Temporary price caps will only serve to

temporarily cap prices.

<p>But this is surrender, Cheney says. It will discourage the oil and gas

boys back in Texas. You slice a zero off those 600% profit margins, and

you're yielding ground to the creeping socialists. What possible

incentive will anyone have to keep America great if the government

meddles with their aspirations for unlimited profit? No, it's better that

we citizens clean out our savings accounts and send them to Houston and

keep free market morale up. Think of your check as a war bond.

<p>It is no coincidence, of course, that Cheney and his understudy in the

Oval Office drew the battle lines on energy, where they know the terrain.

<p>But this is only one front in a larger war. Once he's mopped up his

victory on energy, Cheney will have his hands full elsewhere in the

nation. I'm sure he was shocked when he took office and opened the books

on the federal budget to find just how deeply the socialists have crept

into our culture. Look around, and pity the poor vice president his task

to restore our free markets to their full glory before it's too late:

<p><i> Milk. </i> My heavens, did you know that the some dairy farmers

have created a cartel to set their own prices? Worse, the government sets

the minimum prices for the rest of them. That's not creeping socialism,

that's socialism at a full gallop. I'm afraid we'll have to forego milk

and cheese for a few years while Cheney straightens out this mess.

<p><i> Sugar. </i> Can you believe this? Socialists have actually crept

into our candy bars and breakfast cereals. No free market for these guys.

They get propped up at both ends to the tune of $1.9 billion a year.

Government agents protect our borders against cheaper imported sugar.

Thus our domestic growers can produce sugar here at higher prices, and

the government buys and pays to store all the surplus.

<p><i> Timber. </i> Loggers are sometimes thought to be kissing cousins of

the oilmen. Actually, they turned their back on the free market and went

socialist a long time ago. Have you noticed, for instance, they all wear

red plaid shirts? In 1998, taxpayers spent $126 million opening up roads

so that the timber industry could cut down trees in national forests.

This year, with government help, the industry blocked the free market

import of lumber from Canada on grounds that Canada's subsidies, oh dear,

were higher than ours. The result: The price of a sheet of plywood has

gone up 40% in the U.S.

<p><i> Fish. </i> For years, commercial fishermen resisted government

intrusion into their business--right up to the moment when they stripped

too many fish from the oceans. In a free market system, they'd face

bankruptcy. Instead, they're going for a socialist handouts. West Coast

fishermen will soon share in a $50-million taxpayer bailout--selling

their boats directly to the government if fishermen promise to stop

fishing for fish that are not there.

<p><i> Boeing. </i> Sad but true, socialism has crept into our big

industry too. One recent example: The Pentagon announced it would

subsidize production of Boeing's C-17 cargo plane, which nobody but the

Air Force seems to want. If you're an airfreight hauler and buy a C-17,

the Pentagon says it will channel shipping business your way, never mind

the free market system of bids.

<p>This is just a sampler, but you can see what Cheney is up against. He

might wonder why the United States hasn't collapsed entirely, instead of

being well fed and prosperous by tinkering with the principles of the

free market.

<p>But that won't happen with energy, he vows. No socialist price caps

for California and the West. It's time to stand up against those who

think government should go meddling. It's time to let the markets work

their wonder. Gather 'round your candles, friends. Listen to Dick

Cheney's ringing battle cry. Or was it Churchill's? Doesn't matter:

"Never in the field of human conflict was so much owed by so many to so

few."
