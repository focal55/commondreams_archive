President Bush worries that the "United States might become militarily

engaged" in Colombia. It's a little late for that. While official U.S.

soldiers and airmen try to avoid the appearance of armed engagement,

U.S. paramilitaries-private sector warriors under contract to the

Pentagon-were involved in an exchange of fire between FARC guerillas and

Colombian police last week. It's all part of U.S. long term military

plans in the region-even if George W. Bush hasn't figured them out yet.



<p>Whether they are called paramilitaries, mercenaries or private military

advisers, they are certainly an integral part of the growing U.S.

involvement in the war in Colombia. The <a href="http://commondreams.org/headlines01/0223-02.htm">February 18 exchange of fire</a>

between FARC guerrillas and Colombian police, which involved a DynCorp

Search and Rescue helicopter flown by M-16 toting Americans, made the

depth of U.S. engagement obvious for the first time since Congress voted

yes on Plan Colombia-the $1.3 billion aid package-eight months ago. 



<p>DynCorp, based in Reston, Virginia, is the largest of a growing number

of private military corporations. It boasts $1.4 billion in contracts a

year-95% with the U.S. government-and has 30 personnel in Colombia,

mostly pilots and mechanics for helicopters and fumigation planes.  The

incident, in which the DynCorp helicopter rescued the pilot amid what

one Colombian police officer described as a "shower of bullets,"

highlighted the presence of U.S. civilians in the conflict region. In

the last two years at least six U.S. private military corporations have

set up offices in Bogota, positioning themselves to receive aid package

dollars and raising serious questions about accountability and

transparency. While American soldiers in Colombia are under strict

orders to avoid entering combat areas or joining military operations,

employees of DynCorp and other private corporations face no such

restrictions and are not required to report to the Pentagon or

Congress.



<p>Many, including former Drug Czar Barry McCaffrey, are in favor of this

arrangement. McCaffrey says, "I am unabashedly an admirer of

outsourcing. There's very few things in life you can't outsource."

Proponents of outsourcing say it is cheaper and helps avoid the public

outrage over U.S. troops being sent home in body bags. DynCorp lost

three pilots in three years in Colombia and hardly anyone noticed. By

contrast, when five active duty American soldiers were killed in a spy

plane crash in the Colombian jungle, the incident occupied the front

page for days. "It is very handy to have an outfit not part of the U.S.

Armed Forces, obviously. If someone gets killed, or whatever," you can

say he's not a soldier, said Myles Frenchette, former U.S. ambassador to

Colombia.



<p>The U.S. allocation of almost $120 million to renovate and upgrade air

bases in El Salvador, Ecuador, and the Caribbean is another sign of the

escalating U.S. military operations in the region. The FARC called it a

"declaration of war." A recent Washington Post article exposed U.S.

expansion of the Ecuadorian air base, which is home to 150 military

advisers, mechanics, and crew. By summer 2001 the base will be able to

accommodate surveillance planes and over 400 personnel. This was news to

many, including members of Congress like Arizona Senator John McCain,

who confessed, "We're upgrading a base in Ecuador, which I found

out-perhaps I shouldn't admit this-by looking at a newspaper." 



<p>Base expansion also has ramifications for Colombia's neighbors. The

mayor of an Ecuadorian border town said "If Colombia is going to be

another Vietnam- then Ecuador is going to become the Cambodia. We are

being dragged into the conflict against our will." 



<p>Plan Colombia, complete with private military actors, base expansions,

and military training programs, epitomizes what President Bush recently

called "our ugly American problem." Bush could use his meeting with

Pastrana to develop an alternative Plan Colombia that provided resources

for sustainable development, humanitarian assistance, and judicial and

civil institutions, as a way of concretely and proactively addressing

the challenges Colombia faces. Otherwise, military expansion-whether

private or official U.S. army-seems inevitable.
