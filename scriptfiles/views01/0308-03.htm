<i>"The Revolution will not be televised" </i>-- but it will be web-based. That,

at least, is the hope of four activists who joined forces last November to

create an unprecedented new web site, The Electronic Intifada

(<a href="http://www.electronicIntifada.net">http://www.electronicIntifada.net</a>). 



<p>Even before its official launch on February 28th, the site had been lauded

in the Dutch morning newspaper "De Volkskrant," and had received praise

from iconoclastic columnist Alexander Cockburn, who wrote in The Nation

that "Even the relatively better-informed mainstream accounts fail to

convey the brutality of [Israel's apartheid policies]. There are a number

of excellent news outlets for those who want unjaundiced reporting....The

Electronic Intifada...is trusted."



<p>The Electronic Intifada aims to enable a growing, worldwide network of

human rights and media activists to challenge myth, spin, and distortion

about Palestinians and Palestinian rights disseminated by Israel's official

spokespersons and allied pro-Israeli organizations in North America and

Europe. Embodying the principle, stated on the site's contact page, that

"the intifada was never about individual power, but about collective

power," the four activists, Scotsman Nigel Parry, Diaspora Palestinians Ali

Abunimah and Arjan El Fassed and I collaborated over the Internet on the

Electronic Intifada's development for five months before introducing the

site last week with the battle cry: "You have permission to think

critically!" The site's launch announcement, widely distributed to

thousands of email addresses throughout the world, generated over 200

subscribers to the Electronic Intifada's email alert service in just 48

hours.



<p>Other than searing but hasty images of violence, the most significant

dimensions of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict--historical, legal,

political, and economic--are rarely covered in-depth, if at all, by the

mainstream Western media. Ironically, the media has also neglected another,

key dimension of the conflict: the media itself. The advent of the Internet

has highlighted the media's direct and indirect roles in reinforcing

representations of and policies towards Palestinians, allowing enterprising

individuals throughout the world to log-on to sites reporting direct from

Palestine, thus allowing them to compare the nature and depth of indigenous

coverage to that of the major international news outlets. The Internet also

allows activists and media critics from all points on the globe to join

efforts to challenge media representations underpinning the dynamics of the

conflict. 



<p>In September 1996, Nigel Parry, then webmaster at Bir Zeit University in

the occupied West Bank, helped to launch the first-ever web site reporting

live from an active war zone, during the fighting that broke out over the

tunnel incident in Jerusalem. That experience taught him that "the main

reason that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has carried on as long as it

has is simply because the Israelis have learned very well the importance of

winning the war of words. Since the Internet became such a phenomenon, this

has become a key new arena in which to carry on this war of words, not

least [...] because it overturns the tables on the traditional power

structure of media." The Electronic Intifada allows Palestinians to narrate

their own experience, history, hopes and goals, direct and unmediated to an

international audience accustomed to apprehending Palestinian realities

only through Israeli media filters.



<p>The four founders of The Electronic Intifada had been crossing paths and

sharing ideas for several years--largely through the Internet. In Chicago,

Ali Abunimah, a Palestinian graduate student and the Vice President of the

Arab American Action Network, had made his mark on media monitoring in the

late 1990s by single-handedly challenging the mainstream US media's daily

depiction of events in Israel-Palestine through a series of email letters

that he made available to activists throughout the world on his own

website, "Ali Abunimah's Bitter Pill," at www.abunimah.org. Abunimah's

archive of protest letters is now linked to The Electronic Intifada site.



<p>Meanwhile, Arjan El Fassed, a Palestinian political scientist, media

activist, and human rights specialist living in the Netherlands had also

distinguished himself as an effective cyber-activist, spearheading boycott

campaigns against Burger King and Benneton for opening franchises in

Israeli settlements in the Occupied Territories, and producing a prodigious

amount of Op-Eds and letters to editors of papers in Europe, the US, the UK

and Canada. El Fassed is also a co-founder of Al-Awda, the Palestine Right

of Return Coalition.



<p>Having lived and worked as a researcher, editor, journalist and translator

in Israel/Palestine and Lebanon between 1991 and 1997, I had returned to

the US and assumed the editorship of Middle East Report in early 1998, at

which time I befriended Parry, Abunimah and El Fassed through a Palestinian

email discussion list. We quickly became cyber-friends and colleagues,

conducting brainstorming sessions, critiquing each other's work, and

writing to each other regularly to express our dismay at the continuing

lack of critical media coverage of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the

persistence of US and Israeli efforts to achieve "peace" while bypassing

any question of justice and all instruments of international law.



<p>Our dismay quickly transformed into outrage upon the eruption of the

al-Aqsa Intifada in September 2000, sparked by Ariel Sharon's provocative

walk-about on the Haram Ash-Sharif. As the death tolls climbed and images

of Palestinian children falling in hails of Israeli bullets dominated

television news reports, we all found ourselves putting aside our own

personal and professional lives to respond to mounting requests from

journalists, other activists, scholars and policy analysts for information,

on-the-ground contacts, and international legal documents to challenge

biased and inaccurate Western media representations of the confrontations.



<p>Upon realizing that the Israeli Government had mounted its own carefully

orchestrated media campaign to spin news reports to its own advantage, we

realized the time had come to respond in a more coordinated and

comprehensive manner. Parry, particularly disturbed by Israeli attempts to

assign the blame for Palestinian children's deaths to their parents, not

the Israeli Army, suggested last October that we create a new web site that

would centralize information and resources while also providing concise and

factual rejoinders to Israeli myths and spin techniques. The site's

fact-sheets and media activism sections would offer clear directives

empowering activists to challenge media representations in an informed and

effective manner at the local, national, and international levels. Further

brainstorming led to a commitment that the site would be a much-needed

"cyber-clearinghouse" of links to relevant international legal documents,

human rights reports, UN resolutions, maps of settlement building,

verifiable statistics on deaths and injuries.



<p>Apparently, the Electronic Intifada has filled a need. A week after its

launch, the site has received a large number of messages expressing

gratitude and appreciation, such as the following posts: 



<p>"Keep up the excellent work! I know that may sound hollow, but I figure you

probably get enough hate mail that you deserve to have some good!"



<p>"Thank you so much for your website! It is a marvelous resource, and very

well put together."



<p>"I just wanted to write and say what an excellent site you created with

your colleagues. I especially liked the section on media activism and how

to deal with the media. Take care and continue the hard work."



<p>In addition to providing crucial resources for media and human rights

activists, the Electronic Intifada also hopes to provide valuable services

to journalists covering the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and related

issues, such as the Palestinian refugees' right of return, the US

Government's uncritical and massive military and financial support of

Israel despite its continuing pattern of grave human rights violations, and

the Palestinian Authority's deficiencies, as seen through Palestinian eyes.



<p>In the first email alert sent to subscribers, we emphasized that: "Our job

is to help journalists, editors and producers, by letting them know we are

not against them but instead wish to see them perform their jobs to the

best of their abilities. We can help them out by acting as sources for

information and by offering considered responses to their work. When they

get it wrong, we will be there to patiently explain how what they have

published or broadcast doesn't match up to what we know. When they get it

right, we will be there to thank them."



<p>What most journalists consistently "get wrong" is ignoring the key reason

that Palestinians have risen up: to protest the painful and unjust

realities of a 33-year old Israeli occupation of their country. In

establishing the Electronic Intifada, we hope the Internet will give voice

not only to concerned media activists, but more importantly, to

Palestinians so long deprived of the opportunity to narrate what it is like

to live under the world's last occupation regime, which subjects them to a

harsh, interlocking system of daily human rights violations. The injection

of new voices and perspectives into tired media depictions and stale

political debates may well provide a revolutionary catalyst for changing

the way the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is represented and conceptualized,

particularly in those countries whose policymaking greatly influences daily

life for Palestinians under occupation.
