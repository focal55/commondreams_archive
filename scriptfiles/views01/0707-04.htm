What is independent media?  You’re reading one example of it now.  Many 

other examples were present at the Press Freedom event in San Francisco, 

sponsored by Project Censored in late April at San Francisco State 

University.



<p>For the past 25 years, Project Censored, based at Sonoma State in 

California, has selected the top undercovered news stories in the U.S. 

mainstream media.  In other words, the mainstream ran the stories once and 

dropped them, or the stories were ignored altogether.  Either way, the 

public has been kept in the dark about important news.



<p>Consider my friend Ray Cushing.  His story about the federal government’s 

coverup of research that showed how smoking marijuana reduced tumors was 

selected by Project Censored as the 22nd most censored story of 2000.



<p>Well, what partly makes for independence in the independent media is freedom 

from big advertisers.  Ads from corporate America take up two-thirds of 

mainstream newspapers.  (Think of all the trees that were cut down for 

Wal-Mart ads.)



<p>But that’s just one cost of business for the mainstream media that sell 

their audiences to other businesses.  In turn, the businesses pay the 

mainstream media outlets to advertise their products.  This process brings 

returns on investments to mainstream media owners.



<p>For mainstream media to criticize advertisers such as the auto industry 

would be to bite the hand that feeds it.  Under capitalism, corporations 

don’t willingly cut their own throats.



<p>Which leaves independent media free to cover news and views the mainstream 

media dismisses or downplays.  One example is reports on political prisoners 

Linda Evans (recently freed) and Marilyn Buck.  Other examples include the 

lethal effects of U.S. foreign policy on the people of Colombia, East Timor, 

El Salvador, Indonesia, Mexico, Nigeria, Puerto Rico and Serbia, a partial 

list to be sure. Mainstream coverage of the Middle East leads many Americans 

to think that Palestine is occupying Israel, when the opposite is true.  

Keeping the American people unaware of their government’s deadly foreign 

policy is a major achievement of the U.S. mainstream.



<p>Activism and analysis around the struggles of the poor, the nonwhite, young 

and women in America has a home in independent media.  This is urgent 

because the American work force is increasingly made up of women and people 

of color.  Their experience living and working in a racist and sexist 

society should be at the center—not the margins—of independent media’s voice 

for social change.  The current campaigns against racial profiling and 

prison building featured in independent media are positive steps in that 

direction.  There is room for improvement.



<p>Without question, independent media has many challenges.  One is that it’s 

not quite awash in money, battling hostile corporate mergers and 

acquisitions.  On one hand, there is no pressure from Ford and General 

Motors to weaken independent media’s contents.  On the other, the 

independence from corporate ads means that the money to produce and 

distribute independent media must come from the general public.  But the 

bottom line is that independent media is able to put news and views out that 

the mainstream can’t for business reasons, and more.



<p>In Manufacturing Consent, Edward Herman and Noam Chomsky use case studies to 

detail how the mainstream media passes through and is shaped by five 

filters.  According to Herman and Chomsky, there are five filters in the 

mainstream: sourcing, ownership, advertising, flak and anti-communist 

ideology.  These filters make up their “propaganda model,” a framework for 

analyzing and understanding mainstream media’s performance.



<p>Here’s more on one of Herman and Chomsky’s mainstream filters. Official 

sources.  They are political representatives and business leaders with power 

and wealth.  California Governor Gray Davis. President George W. Bush.  Bill 

Gates.  Mainstream news relies on them.



<p>By contrast, independent media relies on unofficial sources.  They don’t 

have  power and wealth, just news and information about life as it’s lived 

by those with little or no access to the mainstream.  Energy expert Daniel 

M. Berman.  Prison writer Mumia Abu-Jamal.  Author and professor Martha E. 

Gimenez.



<p>People who create independent media understand that “who tells the story” 

counts, in the words of performance artist Keith Antar Mason at this year’s 

Project Censored Award Ceremony.



<p>People are born curious about the world around them.  Despite the shadow 

cast on them by the “corporate run and propaganda-run society” that Chomsky 

analyzes so well, people’s natural desire to learn and speak for themselves 

remains alive.  The American people don’t choose to be propagandized.  

Independent media is a case in point.



<p>At the recent Press Freedom event, I talked with a man from Vallejo, 

California about starting an independent paper there.  Some 400,000 people 

live in Vallejo, he said, and they need independent news and views.  He’s 

right.



<p>I also met a woman from Detroit who co-produces a show called “Flush Rush” 

on the radio and Internet <www.ieaamericaradio.com>, thanks to funding by 

the United Auto Workers.  Other independent media people on hand were the 

producers of Eat The State!, a community paper based in Seattle, “a forum 

for anti-authoritarian political opinion, research, and humor” 

.



<p>There are, of course, many struggles in the independent media movement.  

Here’s one featured at the Press Freedom event.



<p>The Democratic Media Legal Project (DMLP) is challenging corporate control 

of the media by the Big Six: AOL Time Warner, Disney-ABC, GE-NBC, 

Viacom-CBS-Westinghouse, Bertelsman and Murdoch’s News Corp-Fox.  Henry 

Kroll heads up the San Francisco-based DMLP .  He told me 

that the goal of the DMLP is to open a legal fight with a popular movement 

similar to the legal battle against racial segregation in alliance with the 

Civil Rights movement.



<p>We weaken alone or strengthen together.  You, the supporters of independent 

media, are us.  And we are you.  Onward.
