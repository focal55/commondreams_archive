To find that one of his daughters has broken Texas's nanny-state drink laws, not once but twice, might be considered a misfortune for George W Bush but for the US president to spend the same week making so many howlers in his  foreign policy looks downright careless.

<p>Whatever the spin put on that beer in downtown Austin, the past few days have not been kind to the Bush administration. First, along with Britain, they had to give up on the idea of introducing 'smart sanctions' against Iraq and bow to Russian and French demands for a further delay. Then there was the indignity suffered by Secretary of State Colin Powell in Budapest where he failed to win over Nato ministers about the importance of the National Missile Defense shield, the Europeans  arguing that it was not the best way to deal with rogue states. Then  the White House let it be known that it is thinking of  opposing the enforcement of a treaty that will finally ban biological weapons by  allowing random inspections of state agencies and private drug companies. 

<p> Bush's team has suffered a serious  setback, but   between now and next year's NATO summit  there is still plenty of time to fine-tune the new Iraqi sanctions regime to make it acceptable to all-comers. In other words, come another day, the two policies will find themselves fighting for their rightful place in the sun.

<p>The same cannot be said of Washington's reaction to the new protocols for the Biological Weapons Convention which is the world's only brake on  biological  weapons of mass destruction. Signed in 1972 and ratified by 143 countries, it was a noble undertaking but lacked  teeth. Now, after six years of  negotiation , protocols have been produced which will allow for thorough tests to  verify  compliance. Most think it's a good thing, but not Washington: they see scope for cheating and will not say where they stand until the next round of talks at the end of July .

<p>If, as looks likely, Bush does turn his back on these new safeguards the repercussions could cause his biggest foreign policy snafu to date.  It will be another  Kyoto, a deliberate flouting of an international treaty and US non-compliance will probably convince other waiverers not to sign up. Bad enough as that is, there is  another black mark in Washington's  response. The protocols have been opposed by US biotech companies because random inspections could  infringe commercial confidentiality on  vaccines and protective clothing, a  sector worth  billions of dollars.

<p>That pressure has helped convince  officials already opposed to the treaty . Another factor was the $17.8 million (£12.5m) paid by the pharmaceutical  industry into Bush's campaign funds . Now it is payback time and if the decision goes against supporting the new protocols it will be money well spent -- at least for drug companies . As for the rest of us, it only diminishes democracy if policy can be bought by corporate America's big bucks.
