PARIS - The people who have shown the most outrage at the loss of the United States seat on the 53-member United Nations Human Rights Commission are the ones who, noticeably, never gave the group much weight.

<div style="visibility:hidden">.</div>

It is true that the commission has no power of enforcement, no machinery of investigation or judicious reflection, just the symbolism of words, the talk shop function that American critics of the United Nations so disdain. But this time the symbol has been used to express a kind of retribution for resentments that have been building up for several years, aggravated now by the Bush administration's apparent indifference to the views of others.

<div style="visibility:hidden">.</div>

When he was a candidate, George W. Bush made a point of saying he thought the super-powerful U.S. needed to be &quot;humble&quot; in dealing with others. Maybe he has forgotten, or maybe it is one of those words that he uses with a special meaning of his own.

<div style="visibility:hidden">.</div>

The vote was a way of reminding him that America is not as indispensable as it likes to claim, or at least that it should have the grace not to flaunt its importance. This message should be taken seriously, precisely because it is a matter of feeling rather than a matter of effective politics - and feelings count.

<div style="visibility:hidden">.</div>

The commission members are chosen by secret ballot of the Economic and Social Council and seats are reserved by geographical groups. The United States is in the bloc with Western Europe. It is nonsense to say that Sudan, one of the African candidates, was named to replace the United States, just as it is nonsense to imagine that Sudan has anything but examples of extreme violation to offer on human rights.

<div style="visibility:hidden">.</div>

The suggestion that the United States should now hold back on paying up the dues it has owed for several years to show its irritation would add self-injury to insult. The point is whether America wants the United Nations to consider it important by making evident that it considers the UN important. That is the answer that the secret hostile voters were trying to provoke, because America has not been counting the United Nations for much except when it endorses the U.S. position.

<div style="visibility:hidden">.</div>

This is what the vote was really about. The assumption that America, with only one vote, automatically commands a solid bloc has worn thin now that there is no longer a Cold War threat to override all other considerations. Gratitude has not evaporated, but issues and priorities have changed and too often America is not prepared to acknowledge that.

<div style="visibility:hidden">.</div>

The European Union, with 15 votes now and perhaps 30 in a few years, with a political need to show as much solidarity among its members as possible, is always going to outvote the United States. There is no antidote but diplomacy, convincing other states that the United States is arguing for the common interest, not just its own demands.

<div style="visibility:hidden">.</div>

Globalization is not just free trade and resistance to it is not just nationalism. Responsibility for the atmosphere, the concept of crimes against humanity which is very different from traditional notions of what to expect from friends and enemies, how to establish identity, are new or transformed issues.

<div style="visibility:hidden">.</div>

The United Nations is founded on the principle of sovereign equality, which inevitably makes for conflict when there is an insistence on applying universal principles of human rights. There is not, and is not going to be, a world government to work out these clashes. The United States, righteous in its good intentions, seeks to do it by manipulating various forms of its power.

<div style="visibility:hidden">.</div>

The paradox of power is that it creates its own counterbalance, which applies to the United States now more than ever before. It is not really equal with the others. It is more equal in the sense that it has to be more careful, more aware of its impact if it wants willing cooperation from the weak.

<div style="visibility:hidden">.</div>

Some damage has been done, not to the United States - except in its self-image as everybody's idol - but to the cause of human rights, which, it must be hoped, will now be advanced more energetically by states such as Sweden and Austria on the commission.

<div style="visibility:hidden">.</div>

The United States will gain if it heeds the message that it must realize it is only one part of the world. To argue defensively that others do worse and get away with it only underscores the point that the United States has a special role and must honor it.
