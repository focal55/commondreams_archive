They were, as we always say at times like this, so very young--finished in 

1976, only two years older than me. I only learned that afterwards, though; 

I always assumed they were several decades older. Maybe this is because I 

had thought no good architecture came out of the late 1960s and 1970s; more 

likely it is that, to a girl born on 28th Street and 9th Avenue, they just 

looked like they'd been there forever. (I also knew for a fact that before I 

was born my oldest sister gave my mother fits trying to do somersaults on 

the railings of the glassed-in observation deck on the 107th floor.)



<p>I only went up to the top once. I think it was on my ninth or tenth 

birthday. I do not actually remember the famous views of the harbor or the 

Statue of Liberty or the Empire State Building. I do remember the dizzy view 

down to the street, the people who looked like ants and the yellow cabs like 

matchbox cars.



<p>I remember that my mother stopped me from whining on the long lines for the 

elevators by having me count the number of languages I heard spoken. I don't 

know the total, but it was more than I had ever heard in such a small space 

and short time. I remember the stupid marbleized keychain with my name on it 

from the souvenir shop, which is probably still collecting dust in our house 

somewhere. I remember the wind whipping my hair on the roof. I used my 

mother's compact to put it into a ponytail, and realized that in getting 

dolled up for the big day in the city I had gotten silver eye shadow on my 

nose.



<p>That was the only time I was up there. But of course like everyone else in 

New York I have looked at those towers more times than I could count. 

Faintly through haze and smog from the Throg's Neck bridge, marking the end 

of epic twelve hour car rides from Bangor. In rosy late afternoon light from 

the Staten Island Ferry, which cost a tenth as much as the Circle Line and 

had almost as good a view. Every sunny day at lunchtime from the Promenade 

one summer. On slides in my architecture history class, while Professor 

Scully, gesturing wildly, exclaimed about how brutal and ugly the towers 

were, how they mocked the great old art deco skyscrapers to the north. On I 

don't know how many cab rides back to Park Slope, from Laguardia at rush 

hour or Manhattan at 3 am.



<p>And now, well, what is there to say? We have all seen the pictures and the 

videos, dozens if not hundreds of times.



<p>Albert Camus, writing to a former friend in Nazi Germany during a time far 

worse than this, said,



<p>"I relive those pilgrimages I once made with all the men of the West: the 

roses in the cloisters of Florence; the gilded bulbous domes of Krakow; the 

Hradschin and its dead palaces; the contorted statues of the Charles Bridge 

over the Oltava; the delicate gardens of Salzburg. My memory has fused 

together such superimposed images to make a single face, which is the face 

of my true native land. And then I feel a pang when I think that, for years 

now, your shadow has been cast over that vital, tortured face. Yet some of 

those places are ones that you and I saw together. It never occurred to me 

that someday we should have to liberate them from you. And even now, at 

certain moments of rage and despair, I am occasionally sorry that the roses 

continue to grow in the cloister of San Marco and the pigeons drop in 

clusters from the Cathedral of Salzburg and the geraniums grow tirelessly in 

the little cemeteries of Silesia.



<p>But at other moments, and they are the only ones that count, I delight in 

this. For all those landscapes, those flowers and those plowed fields, the 

oldest of lands, show you every spring that there are things you cannot 

choke in blood."



<p>The first weekend after it happened, I had the irrational impulse to get 

into my car and drive to New York. It was mainly to see my family and 

friends of course. But it was also to be with the city herself in her 

saddest days, and to assure myself that the organ still played in Saint 

Patrick's and the unicorn tapestries hung in the Cloisters. That the giant 

blue whale I used to be afraid of, and the hall of minerals I loved far more 

than was normal for a six year old, were still on display at the Museum of 

Natural History, and the pushcarts outside were still selling pretzels that 

hardened five minutes after you bought them and hotdogs of unknown origin.



<p><p>That people were still playing catch and touch football on the Long Meadow 

of Prospect Park. That they were still honking on Flatbush Avenue, and 

stepping on each others feet on the subways. That the twins' dignified older 

sisters were still standing, and hopefully were open and perhaps even had a 

few brave souls on their observation desks.



<p>I did not go. It was too soon; it may still be too soon. But in a few weeks 

I will drive to New York. I will prove to myself that there, in the oldest 

and newest and bravest and scariest and greatest of America's cities, there 

are things you cannot choke in blood.
