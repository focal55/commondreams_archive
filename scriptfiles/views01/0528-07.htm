Memorial Day will be celebrated ... by the usual betrayal of the dead,

 by the hypocritical patriotism of the politicians and contractors

 preparing for more wars, more graves to receive more flowers on future

 Memorial Days. The memory of the dead deserves a different dedication. To

 peace, to defiance of governments.



<p>In 1974, I was invited by Tom Winship, the editor of the Boston Globe,

 who had been bold enough in 1971 to print part of the top secret

 Pentagon Papers on the history of the Vietnam War, to write a bi-weekly

 column for the op-ed page of the newspaper. I did that for about a year and

 a half. The column below appeared June 2, 1976, in connection with that

 year's Memorial Day. After it appeared, my column was canceled.

<p align="center"> * * * * * 





<p>Memorial Day will be celebrated as usual, by high-speed collisions of

 automobiles and bodies strewn on highways and the sound of ambulance

 sirens throughout the land.



<p>It will also be celebrated by the display of flags, the sound of bugles and

 drums, by parades and speeches and unthinking applause.



<p>It will be celebrated by giant corporations, which make guns, bombs,

 fighter planes, aircraft carriers and an endless assortment of military

junk

 and which await the $100 billion in contracts to be approved soon by

 Congress and the President.



<p>There was a young woman in New Hampshire who refused to allow her

 husband, killed in Vietnam, to be given a military burial. She rejected the

 hollow ceremony ordered by those who sent him and 50,000 others to their

 deaths. Her courage should be cherished on Memorial Day. There were the B52

 pilots who refused to fly those last vicious raids of Nixon's and

 Kissinger's war. Have any of the great universities, so quick to give

 honorary degrees to God-knows-whom, thought to honor those men at this

 Commencement time, on this Memorial Day?



<p>No politician who voted funds for war, no business contractor for the

 military, no general who ordered young men into battle, no FBI man who

 spied on anti-war activities, should be invited to public ceremonies on

this

 sacred day. Let the dead of past wars he honored. Let those who live pledge

 themselves never to embark on mass slaughter again.

<p>"The shell had his number on it. The blood ran into the ground...Where

 his chest ought to have been they pinned the Congressional Medal, the

 DSC, the Medaille Militaire, the Belgian Croix de Guerre, the Italian gold

 medal, The Vitutea Militara sent by Queen Marie of Rumania. All the

 Washingtonians brought flowers .. Woodrow Wilson brought a bouquet of

 poppies."



<p>Those are the concluding lines of John Dos Passos angry novel 1919. Let us

 honor him on Memorial Day.



<p>And also Thoreau, who went to jail to protest the Mexican War.



<p>And Mark Twain, who denounced our war against the Filipinos at the turn of

 the century.



<p>And I.F. Stone, who virtually alone among newspaper editors exposed the

 fraud and brutality of the Korean War.



<p>Let us honor Martin Luther King, who refused the enticements of the

 White House, and the cautions of associates, and thundered against the

 war in Vietnam.



<p>Memorial Day should be a day for putting flowers on graves and planting

 trees. Also, for destroying the weapons of death that endanger us more than

 they protect us, that waste our resources and threaten our children and

 grandchildren.



<p>On Memorial Day we should take note that, in the name of "defense," our

 taxes have been used to spend a quarter of a billion dollars on a

 helicopter assault ship called "the biggest floating lemon," which was

 accepted by the Navy although it had over 2,000 major defects at the

 time of its trial cruise.



<p>Meanwhile, there is such a shortage of housing that millions live in

 dilapidated sections of our cities and millions more are forced to pay

 high rents or high interest rates on their mortgages. There's 90 billion

for

 the B1 bomber, but people don't have money to pay hospital bills.



<p>We must be practical, say those whose practicality has consisted of a

 war every generation. We mustn't deplete our defenses. Say those who

 have depleted our youth, stolen our resources. In the end, it is living

 people, not corpses, creative energy, not destructive rage, which are our

 only real defense, not just against other governments trying to kill us,

but

 against our own, also trying to kill us.



<p>Let us not set out, this Memorial Day, on the same old drunken ride to

 death.
