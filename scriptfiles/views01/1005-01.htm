Every crisis and tragedy is an opportunity for

some, as any ambulance-chasing lawyer can tell you.

We expect the Pentagon to lard its already bloated

budget, and Attorney General John Ashcroft to chip

away at the Bill of Rights, all in the name of the War

Against Terrorism.



         <p>But "Trade Promotion Authority?" That seems

like quite a stretch. Yet the Bush administration is

preparing to whisk this through Congress on the same

pretext, even at the risk of provoking the first post-

September-11 partisan fight.



         <p>Trade Promotion Authority (formerly known

as "fast track") would give the Administration power

to negotiate new international commercial

agreements, with Congress having only a yes-or-no

vote on the final product. First in line is the

controversial 34-country "Free Trade Area of the

Americas" (FTAA).



         <p>"Will the Congress strongly support free trade

as a cornerstone of international leadership?" asks US

Trade Representative Robert Zoellick, the Bush

Administration's point man. Well, that depends on

what he means by "free trade." Skepticism among the

public abounds: in a recent poll by the University of

Maryland, 72 percent said that US officials who make

trade policy give too little consideration to the

concerns of working Americans.



         <p>They have good reason to be wary. What

Zoellick doesn't tell us is that the vast majority of

Americans have actually lost income as a result of our

increased opening to trade over the last 20 years,

and the ways in which this has been done.



         <p>Most economists are reluctant to admit this in

public, because free trade is something of a religion

among the profession. But it is a solid conclusion

from their own research.



         <p>Economists have estimated how much trade

has contributed to the upward redistribution of

income in the United States. They have also tried to

measure how much our national economy gains, in

terms of increased income, from removing tariffs and

other barriers to trade.



         <p>It turns out that for the vast majority of

Americans, trade's effect on redistribution -- from the

lower and middle-income groups to the wealthier --

outweighs the gains from cheaper imports. This is

true even if we use the more inflated estimates of the

gains from trade; and even if we use the lower

estimates by economists of how much trade has

increased inequality.



         <p>Virtually all economists agree that trade has

contributed to the widening gap between those who

have a college degree, and the three-quarters of the

US labor force that does not have one. The question

is, how much? If we take the lower estimates of how

much trade has increased inequality, then three-

quarters of the labor force has lost between 1.6 and

2.4 percent of their income over the past two decades,

as a result of trade opening.



         <p>If we take a higher estimate of the effect of

trade on income distribution, then three-fourths of the

American labor force has lost between 12.2 and 12.9

percent of their income.



         <p>And all of this ignores, as standard economic

models do, the economic losses due to the closing of

factories and long spells of unemployment that result

from trade.



         <p>The polls reflect these economic trends. It is a

striking case of the "less educated" having a much

more accurate view of economic reality than the

pundits and intellectuals who dominate the print and

broadcast media.  It does not take a Ph.D. in

economics to figure out that throwing the majority of

the US labor force into increasing competition with

people earning a few dollars per day will lower wages

for most workers here. Nor does one have to be

overly cynical to realize that this in fact has been one

of the main purposes of our international commercial

agreements.



         <p>So when Mr. Zoellick asks us to support "free

trade" in the interests of national security, he should

at least be honest about one thing: he is asking the

majority of Americans to make more economic

sacrifices, while others get richer.



         <p>Of course the label "free trade" is a

misrepresentation of these agreements. Both NAFTA

and the WTO have expanded the most costly form of

protectionism on Earth, in terms of both economic

costs and human life. That is the international

extension of patent protection for pharmaceuticals,

against generic competition. And  NAFTA gave

corporations a powerful new right to sue governments

directly, which they have already used to overturn

environmental regulations.



         <p>All of which explains why we need the full

participation of our elected Congressional

representatives in the formulation of international

commercial policy. And why Administration officials,

now wrapping themselves in the flag, are so eager to

restrict their involvement.

Gains Make Us Rich? An Assessment of the Prospective
