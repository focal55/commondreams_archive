Last week, Gov. Gray Davis proclaimed that conservation and new

energy supplies will allow California to make it through this summer

without additional rate increases. On Monday, he announced a "sweetheart

deal" to save one of the state's largest utilities even as the other

slunk behind the protection of a bankruptcy court.

<p>In fact, none of these actions will change this basic reality: An

unscrupulous "seller's cartel" now manipulating California's electricity

market is likely to make this summer unbearable. This cartel consists of

the major companies controlling most of the uncommitted electric

generation and natural gas transmission contracts in the Western United

States.

<p>To fight this cartel, we propose a plan with a stiffer backbone--a

hard-nosed "buyers' cartel" and, if necessary, the forced purchase of

in-state generating plants. Failing such actions, Californians face a

blackout-riddled summer with a potential electricity bill of nearly $50

billion.

<p>The governor's plan to beat the sellers' cartel is built on too many

"ifs": If the West escapes a hot summer, if the increasingly unreliable

power plants suffer no outages, if 20% conservation gains materialize, if

there's enough natural gas to fuel new plants, if the cartel doesn't

withhold supply.

<p>Failing any one of these "ifs," and with forecasts warning of Stage 3

alerts that could stretch a full six months, the sellers' cartel would

gorge as it never has before. Wholesale prices could double or triple

from already exorbitant rates of 25 and 50 cents per kilowatt-hour to a

dollar or more. This power costs no more than 15 cents to produce.

<p>Unfortunately, Davis' strategy to negotiate long-term power contracts

does little to reduce California's short-run vulnerability. Most

contracts don't even begin until 2002. President Bush and federal

regulators could end this crisis tomorrow by imposing hard price caps and

ordering the cartel to supply power to the market. They have steadfastly

refused. The results are staggering.

<p>The sellers' cartel first took utility shareholders on a $13-billion

ride to insolvency. After bleeding them dry, it was the taxpayers' turn.

Indeed, after state government took over purchasing power in January,

California's healthy budget surplus dropped by more than $5 billion. This

led the Public Utilities Commission to approve the largest rate hike in

California history.

<p>However, if the governor's "Hail Mary" strategy fails, we project

additional rate hikes of 100% or more. To avert this disaster, we propose

that California join with the other "victim states" of Oregon and

Washington to form a "buyers' cartel"--in essence, a buyers'-side

monopsony to fight the sellers' price-fixing oligopoly.

<p>In particular, we propose offering a "fair price" to the sellers'

cartel, but not a penny more. This fair price would be cost-based--not

market driven--and calculated daily on natural gas prices and other

factors. It would include a generous profit margin to ensure sufficient

incentives for investment in the Western market and result in an average

price of 15 to 20 cents.

<p>As an ancillary weapon, California must force the sale of all in-state

plants owned by any member of the sellers' cartel refusing to provide

ample power at the fair price. Under a declared state of emergency, the

state has the authority to purchase the plants at reasonable prices, and

they can be run by qualified utility operators.

<p>Forming a buyers' cartel will almost certainly spark retaliatory

blackouts as the sellers test the political will of our legislators and

governor. To prepare, we must end highly disruptive random rolling

blackouts. Instead, divide the states into identifiable blackout zones

and, with sufficient notice, flip switches off as need be. The benefits

to businesses and residents of knowing when the power will be turned off

are considerable. Increased crime risks can be offset by targeted police

deployment.

<p>The state should also buy literally truckloads of new, efficient air

conditioners. Utility employees, youth groups and other volunteers must

move systematically through the hot valley spots throughout the

California offering to replace old air conditioners--our Achilles' heel

during the summer time peak.

<p>On the energy supply front, the state should continue its effort to

build emergency power plant capacity far from population centers but near

the transmission grid--no-frill plants built quickly. There will be no

better weapon against the cartel than standing reserves.

<p>We do not understate the challenge of staring down a group of

well-financed energy companies. There are no other reasonable options,

and the stakes are too important to succumb to the generators' "rolling

blackmail."
