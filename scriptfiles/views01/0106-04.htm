Got consumer debt?  Watch out for the coming recession.



<p>Working people have good reason to be concerned.  Why?  For starters, 

economic slowdowns force employers to cut expenses by laying off employees.  

This trend is hard to miss today in the U.S. economy.



<p>Now job uncertainty in a recession is one thing.  What makes the threat of 

unemployment harsher is the record level of debt held by U.S. consumers.



<p>Seven trillion dollars. That’s the amount of debt U.S. consumers carried in 

1999, up from $3.55 trillion in 1990, according to the Federal Reserve 

Board.



<p>Indebted Americans aren’t faceless.  The $7 trillion in consumer debt is 

held by the self-employed, college students, retirees.  Employed 

single-parents are especially at-risk during a recession.



<p>Meanwhile, health insurance premiums and energy costs are rising.  Such 

factors are helping to increase workers' use of plastic instead of paychecks 

to purchase clothes, food, shelter and transportation.



<p>Consumers are also in harm’s way as the economy slows down because 

recessions make it harder for them to repay their loans.  That's living on 

the edge.  Now more than ever, debt-ridden workers would benefit greatly 

from pay raises.



<p>To be sure, there was low unemployment during the 1990s.  This went 

hand-in-hand with the boom in borrowing and buying.  The trend of spending 

based on lending came on the heels of Congress refusing to increase the 

minimum wage for nine years during the 1980s.



<p>Now, it’s not that cash purchases for goods and services disappeared last 

decade.  It’s that credit-based consumption took off.  Part of this story is 

the low wages of temporary workers without pensions, health insurance and 

vacations.  The numbers of temporary workers rose sharply during the 

Reagan-Bush-Clinton administrations, up 577% in the 16 years ended in 1998, 

according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.



<p>Currently, Uncle Sam underpays many of his temporary employees.  About every 

tenth federal government contract worker makes an hourly wage that falls 

below the federal poverty level, the Economic Policy Institute recently 

reported.  That would be less than $8.20 per hour based on a 40-hour week of 

work.  Such wages fall below the yearly federal poverty level for a family 

of four.



<p>Rising employment doesn’t necessarily boost workers’ salaries.  And millions 

of Americans who earn unlivable wages must pay for the essentials of daily 

life with borrowed instead of earned money.



<p>Meanwhile, the official metaphor for a recession is one of an aircraft 

arriving for a landing, “soft” or “hard,” to end the record U.S. economic 

expansion that began in 1991.  This conceals rather than reveals that behind 

the “New Economy” of fiber optics and stock options, many working Americans 

have increasingly relied upon credit to make ends meet.  They are the many 

who have not gained the “wealth effect” from the stock market and have 

instead been saddled with a rising tide of consumer debt.



<p>Speaking of the stock market, Main Street’s debt burden won’t be lightened 

much by the federal estate-tax cut favored by President-elect George W. 

Bush.  His proposal would, however, free up more funds for the stock market.



<p>A recent report in the Wall Street Journal noted that "Industry groups that 

raised record sums of money for George W. Bush and the Republican Party have 

great expectations for the president-elect -- and a few favors to ask.  

Securities and investment companies, which contributed $22.2 million to Mr. 

Bush and other Republican candidates, hope the new administration can get 

Congress to expand IRAs and 401(k) accounts, and reduce taxes, among other 

things."



<p>In the meantime, the Fed has no need to halt “inflationary imbalances.”  The 

conventional wisdom suggests that now is the time to cut the cost of 

borrowed money to halt the recession.  Well, such a move from the Fed could 

strengthen workers' buying power in 2001.  But it could also increase their 

indebtedness.



<p>To be sure, much hangs in the balance for working people, economically 

speaking.  One thing is certain.  Indebted Americans whose borrowing and 

buying spurred economic growth during last decade's record economic 

expansion may well be the canaries in the mine as the U.S. economy lands 

“hard” or “soft.”
