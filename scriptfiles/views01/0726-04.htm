Let us now have a moment of silence for the victims of the Ball Park

Franks fiasco.



<p>Thank you.



<p>This is the situation: Bil Mar Foods is a unit of the Chicago-based giant

Sara Lee Corporation, the maker of pound cakes, cheesecakes, pies,

muffins, L'Eggs, Hanes, Playtex and Wonderbra products -- your typical

food and underwear conglomerate.



<p>Bil Mar makes hot dogs -- Ball Park franks hot dogs. You've seen them when

you go to a baseball game at Tiger Stadium in Detroit and elsewhere.



<p>Last month, Sara Lee pled guilty to two misdemeanor counts in connection

with a listeriosis outbreak that led to the deaths of at least 21

consumers who ate Ball Park Franks hot dogs and other meat products. One

hundred people were seriously injured. The company paid a $200,000 fine.



<p>According to Kenneth Moll, a Chicago attorney representing the families of

the victims, this is what happened:



<p>Bil Mar has a hot dog facility in Zeeland, Michigan. The company shut down

the facility over the July 4th weekend of 1998 to replace a refrigeration

unit that was above the hot processing facility. The hot dogs are heated

at one end and sent down a conveyer belt to the other.



<p>Moll's theory is that the removal of the air conditioning unit and its

replacement dislodged some dangerous bacteria in the ceiling. When the

plant reopened, steam from the passing hot dogs went up to the ceiling,

condensed and dripped back down with the dangerous bacteria onto the hot

dogs.



<p>In November 1998, Paul Mead from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) in

Atlanta started receiving calls from the state health departments around

the country that had isolated strains of a deadly bacteria, Listeria

monocytogenes.



<p>Mead looked at the bacteria and found that they were the same strain. He

sent out questionnaires and discovered there was an open package of hot

dogs in the home of one of the people who died. The CDC tested the hot

dogs and isolated the same bacterial strain -- a DNA fingerprint of the

type of bacteria.



<p>According to Moll, Mead went to the Bil Mar plant in Zeeland, Michigan and

tested unopened packages of hot dogs and was able to isolate the same DNA

fingerprint bacteria. In December 1998, Sara Lee ordered a recall of

millions of pounds of hot dogs and deli meats.



<p>According to a series of reports in the Detroit Free Press, plant workers

were regularly testing work surfaces for the presence of cold-loving

bacteria -- a class of bacteria that includes the deadly Listeria

monocytogenes as well as some harmless bacteria.



<p>According to the Free Press, beginning in July 1998, after the replacement

of the old refrigeration unit, workers recorded a sharp increase in the

presence of cold-loving bacteria. The number of positive samples remained

high until the company stopped performing tests in November 1998 -- a

month before the Sara Lee recall.



<p>"Sara Lee was doing testing of the environment in the plant for

cold-loving bacteria," said Caroline Smith DeWaal of the Center for

Science in the Public Interest. "Then their tests started coming up

positive, so they stopped testing. They knew they had a problem with

bacteria in the plant. But instead of solving it, they chose to ignore

it."



<p>This is crucial, because if the company knew that they were had a Listeria

monocytogenes problem and ignored it, they could be hit with a felony

conviction. And felony convictions have all kinds of collateral

consequences, including possible loss of federal contracts -- Sara Lee had

a big hot dog contract with the Department of Defense.



<p>In an interview, U.S. Attorney Phillip Green said there was insufficient

evidence to bring a felony charge.



<p>"There was simply no evidence that Sara Lee Bil Mar knew that the food

product that they were producing and shipping out was adulterated with

Listeria monocytogenes," Green told us.



<p>When asked about the allegations raised by the Free Press that the company

was testing for cold-loving bacteria, Green told us, "the testing that you

are referring to is known as Low Temperature Pathogens testing -- that is

a very general test that does not necessarily indicate the presence of

Listeria monocytogenes."



<p>"The USDA regulations don't require a plant to conduct testing on finished

product for the presence of deadly pathogens such as Listeria

monocytogenes," Green said. "And Bil Mar was following accepted industry

practices in conducting general testing for the low temperature

pathogens."



<p>But Green refused to answer specific questions about evidence concerning a

possible felony violation.



<p>Moll -- the attorney representing the victims -- told us that the evidence

"does necessarily indicate the presence of Listeria monocytogenes." The

CDC's Mead found studies showing that, had Sara Lee done further testing

for the deadly strain of listeria, almost half of the cold-loving bacteria

could have tested positive for Listeria monocytogenes.



<p>But U.S. Attorney Green never read Mead's report. He never called on Mead,

perhaps the crucial expert in this case, to testify before the grand jury.



<p>In fact, it is apparent from our investigation into this matter that

federal prosecutors were overpowered by Sara Lee's outside lawyers in this

case -- the Chicago firm of Jenner & Block, led by former Chicago U.S.

Attorney Anton Valukas.



<p>Valukas refused, on advice of his client, to speak with us.



<p>But the extraordinary degree of the collaboration between Sara Lee and the

federal prosecutors in this case can be seen on Sara Lee's web site where

it has posted a "joint press release."



<p>No, that's not a typo. The U.S. Attorney and Sara Lee issued a joint press

release announcing the plea agreement in which no mention is made of Ball

Park Franks hot dogs.



<p>The issuance of a joint press release is an extraordinary event. U.S.

Attorney Green can't name a case where the prosecutor and convict issued a

joint press release announcing their plea agreement. Neither can the

current chief of the Criminal Division at the Department of Justice,

Michael Chertoff. He calls it "unusual."



<p>In a number of ways, the Sara Lee prosecution brings home the double

standards in our criminal justice system.



<p>A company pleads guilty to a crime that leads to the death of 21 human

beings. The company pleads to two misdemeanors. The company is fined

$200,000. Think about that.



<p>We were so outraged by this that we went over to the White House and asked

President Bush's press secretary about it.



<p>We laid out the facts of the Sara Lee case and then asked our question.

This is how it went:



<p>Question: Ari, has the President expressed a view on the death penalty for

corporate criminals -- that is, revoking the charter of a corporation that

has been convicted of a crime that has resulted in death?



<p>Fleischer:  The President does not weigh in on those matters of justice.

They should not be dictated by decisions made at the White House.



<p>Question: Now, Ari, wait a second. Ari, Ari, wait a second. He's in favor

of the death penalty for individuals generally. Is he in favor of the

death penalty for corporations convicted of crimes that result in death?



<p>Fleischer: These are questions that are handled by officials of the

Justice Department -- not by people at the White House.



<p>Someday, Ari, the White House too will have to answer -- why death to

individual criminals, but not to your corporate criminal paymasters?
