The Supreme Court says a corporation is a person, or at least must be

treated like one when it comes to most constitutional protections.



<p>These protections include the right to speak and the right to act in the

political arena -- giving campaign contributions, lobbying, and

advocating its agenda.



<p>Now, if a corporation is in fact a person, with full constitutional

rights, then it should act like a moral human person.



<p>And what is the fundamental basis of morality? Caring about others.



<p>So, a corporation, to act like a moral human person, is going to have to

care about others, not just about its own bottom line.



<p>It is going to have to care about its human compatriots.



<p>But the vast majority of major corporations don't give a damn about

their fellow persons. As such, they are immoral -- or amoral -- to the

core.



<p>We say, if you are not a human person, and you can't act like a moral

human person, then you should be stripped of your constitutional

protections.



<p>No right to speak, no Fifth Amendment rights, no right to participate in

the political arena. You just produce your products and go home.



<p>It also makes sense to revisit the legal protections that facilitate

corporate im- or a-morality, particularly the corporation's defining

characteristic -- limited liability for shareholders.



<p>Shareholders, the owners of a corporation, invest a certain amount of

money in a company. Under the rules of limited liability, no matter how

much harm the company does, or how much it owes creditors, shareholders

cannot be required to pay more than the amount they already put in.



<p>Lawrence Mitchell, a professor of law at George Washington University,

believes that limited liability for shareholders leads shareholders --

and therefore corporations -- not to care. If your liability is limited,

you won't care as much as if your liability is full.



<p>"We call stockholders owners," Mitchell said recently. "You can hardly

be considered an owner if you don't care, if you don't act like it's

your property. Limited liability encourages stockholders not to care."



<p>Mitchell, who has written a book, Corporate Irresponsibility: America's

Newest Export (Yale University Press, 2001), says that in the absence of

limited liability, the corporation can always buy insurance.



<p>"Insurance internalizes the cost of the risk," Mitchell said. "The

corporation has to pay based on the insurance company's assessment of

the risk, rather than some creditor getting stuck holding the bag if the

corporation fails."



<p>So, yes, Mitchell would strip corporations of their limited liability

protection. Let the chips fall where they may.



<p>Admittedly, these ideas don't appear likely to be implemented soon. But

there may be interim concepts to get us closer.



<p>A first step would be to take away constitutional protections and

limited liability from the worst-acting corporations.



<p>To determine whether a corporation is acting morally, we propose that

Congress legislate a Corporate Character Commission (CCC). This would be

a 10-person panel, with members chosen from the human person community.

Ideal candidates would be ethicists, philosophers, corporate

criminologists and the like.  The CCC would check on the criminal

records, recidivism rates, acts of immorality and other wrongdoing of

the largest corporations.



<p>There is a precedent for this kind of review at the federal level. The

Federal Communications Commission reviews the character of applicants

for federal broadcast licenses. The FCC does not do a very good job of

it, obviously. General Electric, for example, routinely gets renewed

despite its recidivist record.



<p>But just because the FCC can't do it right, doesn't mean the CCC

couldn't do it right.



<p>Now, you are probably saying to yourself ? yeah, right ? hell will

freeze over first before Congress creates such a Commission.



<p>The CCC would be a modest step to a future where the corporations are

subservient to moral human beings, where caring for others takes

precedence over the bottom line, where you and I matter than Enron and

Boeing.
