With Jesse Helms&#039; decision to pull the plug on his sorry political career, attempts will be made to suggest that the senator from North Carolina contributed something of value to the public discourse during his three decades in the U.S. Congress.
<P>In truth, he did - by way of inspiration.
<P>When Jesse was leading one of his many crusades to censor &#034;deviant art&#034; in the late 1980s and early 1990s, he inspired one of America&#039;s savviest songwriters. Frequent National Public Radio contributor Loudon Wainwright III&#039;s &#034;Jesse Don&#039;t Like It&#034; was a minor hit - at least in artistic circles - and is a highlight of Wainwright&#039;s excellent 1999 Hannibal/Rykodisc Records CD, &#034;Social Studies.&#034;
<P>But Jesse really didn&#039;t like it. In a recent interview, Wainwright revealed that he heard from Helms&#039; office about the song. The missive read, in part: &#034;Well, thank you, Mr. Wainwright. If it weren&#039;t for people like you, left-wing, communist, radical, weirdo types, Senator Helms would not have won.&#034;
<P>What was Wainwright&#039;s reaction to the petty partisan? &#034;I thought,&#034; the songwriter recalls, &#034;man, these guys won and they sent me this.&#034; The lyrics to &#034;Jesse Don&#039;t Like It&#034; explain a little about why Jesse didn&#039;t like the song, and a lot about why supporters of free expression didn&#039;t like Jesse:
<P>
<P><EM>If Jesse don&#039;t like it then it&#039;s </EM><EM>prob&#039;ly not art</EM>
<P><EM>Jesse knows what&#039;s good </EM><EM>Ol&#039; Jesse is smart</EM>
<P><EM>And if you don&#039;t like that </EM><EM>don&#039;t feel sad</EM>
<P><EM>&#039;Cause the art that you like </EM><EM>is probably bad</EM>
<P><EM></EM>
<P><EM>Grandma Moses, she&#039;s OK</EM>
<P><EM>Never exposes anything; ev</EM><EM>erything&#039;s far away</EM>
<P><EM>And the statue of David&#039;s </EM><EM>all right with Jesse</EM>
<P><EM>&#039;Cause Michelangelo gave </EM><EM>him such a tiny pee-pee</EM>
<P><EM></EM>
<P><EM>If Jesse don&#039;t like it, it don&#039;t </EM><EM>stay;</EM>
<P><EM>get it out of the museum, get </EM><EM>it out of there today</EM>
<P><EM>Jesse&#039;s fav&#039;rite painting is </EM><EM>the one of the clown</EM>
<P><EM>with the daisy in his hand </EM><EM>and a tear rollin&#039; down</EM>
<P><EM></EM>
<P><EM>In the kindergarten years </EM><EM>ago, Jesse got rude</EM>
<P><EM>He took a red Crayola and </EM><EM>he drew a nude</EM>
<P><EM>And the teacher took a ruler </EM><EM>to Jesse&#039;s behind</EM>
<P><EM>She beat his butt but she </EM><EM>ruin&#039;d his mind</EM>
<P><EM></EM>
<P><EM>Jesse prob&#039;ly didn&#039;t like Pi</EM><EM>casso</EM>
<P><EM>But neither did the dictator </EM><EM>Franco</EM>
<P><EM>And I know about art but </EM><EM>I&#039;ve got to take a hike</EM>
<P><EM>If I like somethin&#039; that Jesse </EM><EM>don&#039;t like</EM>
<P><EM></EM>
<P><EM>If Jesse thinks it&#039;s dirty it </EM><EM>don&#039;t get any funds</EM>
<P><EM>They use the taxpayer&#039;s </EM><EM>money on tobacco and guns</EM>
<P><EM>Your freedom of expression </EM><EM>is bein&#039; denied;</EM>
<P><EM>But if you&#039;re not sure what </EM><EM>you like then just let Jesse de</EM><EM>cide</EM>
<P><EM></EM>
<P><EM>Don&#039;t photograph a penis; </EM><EM>don&#039;t paint a breast</EM>
<P><EM>Don&#039;t write about the truth </EM><EM>because it might offend Jesse</EM>
<P><EM>And don&#039;t tell it like it is, </EM><EM>and don&#039;t show where it&#039;s at</EM>
<P><EM>&#039;Cause Jesse don&#039;t like it </EM><EM>and that is that.</EM>
<P>
