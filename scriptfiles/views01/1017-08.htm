Before September 11, South Asia's problems were legion: over a billion

people, most of them desperately poor; a history of war and violent

conflicts; rising religious militancy; hard-line Hindu nationalists in

power in India, the army in charge in Pakistan;  newly tested nuclear

weapons and a get-tough mood. Now, it is also the frontline of the US

war against Osama bin Laden and the Taliban. South Asia may not be able

to take the strain. The US needs to ensure it does nothing to worsen the

many crises in South Asia and that it thinks long-term, not short term,

about its policies in the region.  



<p>The greatest concern is Pakistan. General Pervez Musharraf justified the

October 1999 coup that brought him to power by citing the prevailing

sense that Pakistan's economy, government, and society were on the verge

of collapse. The fall has been swift; about one in three Pakistanis now

live below the poverty line, double what it was a decade ago. There have

been eight governments in this time. All of them have become wary of

setting-off the widespread public resentment and anger at the

hopelessness of everyday life. They have struggled to not provide

political opportunities to the radical Islamist groups that have emerged

and feed off the misery. Too often, they chose to make concessions to

radical Islam. The military is in the same fix.     



<p>The US bombing campaign against Afghanistan in response to the terrible

attacks of September 11 has opened wide the door for Islamist groups,

with their history of anti-Americanism and strong ties to the Taliban.

They have taken to the streets challenging Musharraf and his decision to

support the U.S. The longer the U.S. bombs Afghanistan, the more

civilians get killed, the greater the humanitarian and refugee crisis,

and the more organized and angry the Islamists' challenge. Musharraf and

the army may hold the line, but the Islamists will come out politically

strengthened. Musharraf may win this battle but lose the war.    



<p>The US should heed the UN High Commissioner for Refugees and suspend its

bombing campaign to allow relief supplies to reach the more than seven

million Afghans in direst need. Calling in the UN Secretary-General and

newest Nobel Peace Prize winner, Kofi Annan, showing him the evidence

and asking him to mediate with the Taliban for a hand-over of Osama bin

Laden for trial would acknowledge the vital role of the UN. Both would

strengthen the hand of Pakistan's government against the militants. 



<p>Pakistan is also trapped by its conflict with India. Reflecting the

intensity and depth of this battle, India and Pakistan have each sought

to take advantage of the situation after September 11. India immediately

offered political and military support to the United States in its

conflict with the Taliban and urged it to include Pakistani-supported

Islamic militants fighting in Kashmir as targets of the US assault on

terrorism. Pakistan, under enormous pressure from the US, eventually

decided to turn a liability into an asset and sought to cash in on its

location and its leverage over the Taliban. 



<p>Seeing Pakistan win the US over to its side, and with the militants

continuing their attacks in Kashmir, India is now trying another more

dangerous gambit. It has threatened to follow the US example and attack

militant training camps and bases in Pakistan. In an ominous

development, India has ended a 10-month long effective cease-fire and

started shelling Pakistani forces across the border that divides

Kashmir. 



<p>The US must press Pakistan to end its support for the militants,

restrain India from actions that may trigger a South Asian war, and get

serious in working with the international community to resolve the more

than fifty year old Kashmir dispute.  For this effort to be taken

seriously, the US must show by word and deed that unilateral military

action is not the order of the day.             



<p>A longer term danger is that of nuclear weapons in South Asia. The May

1998 nuclear tests by India and Pakistan put the world on watch. The US

and the international community used sanctions to pressure both

countries to exercise restraint, and to signal a refusal to accept new

nuclear weapons states. But, in its search for support in the region,

the Bush administration has let go the already waning US hopes to

reverse the nuclearization of South Asia. The US is lifting all its

sanctions against India, most if not (yet) all sanctions against

Pakistan, and economic and military assistance is being offered to both. 



<p>India and Pakistan may return with renewed vigour to their conventional

and nuclear arms race. India seeks US arms to add to its $4 billion arms

deal with Russia and $2 billion deal with Israel. Pakistan's limited

funds have stalled its military purchases. With the army in charge, any

resources freed by a blanket lifting of sanctions may go to catching up

with India. With political and economic pressures eased, both sides may

speed deployment of their nuclear warheads. South Asia may escape the

frying pan of terrorism only to fall into the nuclear fire.    



<p>Also long term is democracy. General Musharraf's new status as ally in

the war against Afghanistan and the man most likely to hold Pakistan

together may lead to the lifting of the US sanctions levied after his

coup. But, concern about Pakistan's stability should not translate into

abandoning democracy and Musharraf should not be allowed or encouraged

to stay in power. The two previous Pakistani generals who seized power

each kept it for the better part of a decade.  Civil society withered

both times. 



<p>Musharraf should hold to his promise of elections and restoring

democracy by next October. Elections may be just what it takes to

mobilise the majority of Pakistanis in the battle against radical Islam.

Whenever they have been allowed to choose who should govern them in the

past, Pakistanis have decisively rejected Islamic political parties.

They would do so again now. The small crowds on the streets supporting

the Islamist groups are testament to that. Ten years without democracy

may change their minds.
