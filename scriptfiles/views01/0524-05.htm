On April 18, scientists at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric

Administration (NOAA) laboratory in Boulder, Colorado, reported that a

huge dust storm from northern China had reached the United States

"blanketing areas from Canada to Arizona with a layer of dust." They

reported that along the foothills of the Rockies the mountains were

obscured by the dust from China.

	

<p>This dust storm did not come as a surprise. On March 10, 2001,

The People's Daily reported that the season's first dust storm-one of

the earliest on record-had hit Beijing. These dust storms, coupled with

those of last year, were among the worst in memory, signaling a

widespread deterioration of the rangeland and cropland in the country's

vast northwest.

	

<p>These huge dust plumes routinely travel hundreds of miles to

populous cities in northeastern China, including Beijing, obscuring the

sun, reducing visibility, slowing traffic, and closing airports. Reports

of residents in eastern cities caulking windows with old rags to keep

out the dust are reminiscent of the U.S. dust bowl of the 1930s. 

Eastward moving winds often carry soil from China's northwest to North

Korea, South Korea, and Japan, countries that regularly complain about

dust clouds that both filter out the sunlight and cover everything with

dust. Responding to pressures from their constituents, a group of 15

legislators from Japan and 8 from South Korea are organizing a

tri-national committee with Chinese lawmakers to devise a strategy to

combat the dust.

	

<p>News reports typically attribute the dust storms to the drought

of the last three years, but the drought is simply bringing a

fast-deteriorating situation into focus. Human pressure on the land in

northwestern China is excessive. There are too many people, too many

cattle and sheep, and too many plows. Feeding 1.3 billion people, a

population nearly five times that of the United States, is not an easy

matter.

	

<p>In addition to local pressures on resources, a decision in

Beijing in 1994 to require that all cropland used for construction be

offset by land reclaimed elsewhere has helped create the ecological

disaster that is now unfolding. In an article in Land Use Policy,

Chinese geographers Hong Yang and Xiubein Li describe the environmental

effects of this offset policy. The fast-growing coastal provinces, such

as Guandong, Shandong, Xheijiang, and Jiangsu, which are losing cropland

to urban expansion and industrial construction, are paying other

provinces to plow new land to offset their losses. This provided an

initial economic windfall for provinces in the northwest, such as Inner

Mongolia (which led the way with a 22-percent cropland expansion),

Gansu, Qinghai, Ningxia, and Xinjiang. 

	

<p>As the northwestern provinces, already suffering from

overplowing and overgrazing, plowed ever more marginal land, wind

erosion intensified. Now accelerating wind erosion of soil and the

resulting land abandonment are forcing people to migrate eastward, not

unlike the U.S. westward migration from the southern Great Plains to

California during the Dust Bowl years.

	

<p>While plows are clearing land, expanding livestock populations

are denuding the land of vegetation. Following economic reforms in 1978

and the removal of controls on the size of herds and flocks that

collectives could maintain, livestock populations grew rapidly. Today

China has 127 million cattle compared with 98 million in the United

States. Its flock of 279 million sheep and goats compares with only 9

million in the United States. 

	

<p>In Gonge County in eastern Quinghai Province, the number of

sheep that local grasslands can sustain is estimated at 3.7 million, but

by the end of 1998, sheep numbers there had reached 5.5 million, far

beyond the land's carrying capacity. The result is fast-deteriorating

grassland, desertification, and the formation of sand dunes.

	

<p>In the New York Times, Beijing Bureau Chief Erik Eckholm writes

that "the rising sands are part of a new desert forming here on the

eastern edge of the Quinghai-Tibet Plateau, a legendary stretch once

known for grass reaching as high as a horse's belly and home for

centuries to ethnic Tibetan herders." Official estimates show 900 square

miles (2,330 square kilometers) of land going to desert each year. An

area several times as large is suffering a decline in productivity as it

is degraded by overuse.

	

<p>In addition to the direct damage from overplowing and

overgrazing, the northern half of China is literally drying out as

rainfall declines and aquifers are depleted by overpumping. Water tables

are falling almost everywhere, gradually altering the region's

hydrology. As water tables fall, springs dry up, streams no longer flow,

lakes disappear, and rivers run dry. U.S. satellites, which have been

monitoring land use in China for some 30 years, show that literally

thousands of lakes in the North have disappeared. 

	

<p>Deforestation in southern and eastern China is reducing the

moisture transported inland from the South China Sea, the East China

Sea, and the Yellow Sea, writes Wang Hongchang, a Fellow at the Chinese

Academy of Social Sciences. Where land is forested, the water is held

and evaporates to be carried further inland. When tree cover is removed,

the initial rainfall from the inland-moving, moisture-laden air simply

runs off and returns to the sea. As this recycling of rainfall inland is

weakened by deforestation, rainfall in the interior is declining.

	

<p>Reversing this degradation means stabilizing population and

planting trees everywhere possible to help recycle rainfall inland. It

means converting highly erodible cropland back to grassland or woodland,

reducing the livestock population, and planting tree shelter belts

across the windswept areas of cropland, as U.S. farmers did to end dust

storms in the 1930s. 

	

<p>In addition, another interesting option now presents itself-the

use of wind turbines as windbreaks to reduce wind speed and soil

erosion. With the cost of wind-generated electricity now competitive

with that generated from fossil fuels, constructing rows of wind

turbines in strategic areas to slow the wind could greatly reduce the

erosion of soil. This also affords an opportunity to phase out the use

of wood for fuel, thus lightening the pressure on forests.

	

<p>The economics are extraordinarily attractive. In the U.S. Great

Plains, under conditions similar to China's northwest, a large advanced

design wind turbine occupying a tenth of a hectare of land can produce

$100,000 worth of electricity per year. This source of rural economic

regeneration fits in nicely with China's plan to develop the

impoverished northwest.  

	

<p>Reversing desertification will require a huge effort, but if the

dust bowl continues to spread, it will not only undermine the economy,

but it will also trigger a massive migration eastward. The options are

clear: Reduce livestock populations to a sustainable level or face heavy

livestock losses as grassland turns to desert. Return highly erodible

cropland to grassland or lose all of the land's productive capacity as

it turns to desert. Construct windbreaks with a combination of trees

and, where feasible, wind turbines, to slow the wind or face even more

soil losses and dust storms. 

	

<p>If China cannot quickly arrest the trends of deterioration, the

growth of the dust bowl could acquire an irreversible momentum. What is

at stake is not just China's soil, but its future.
