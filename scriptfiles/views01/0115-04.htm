The 

              fierce farm crisis that is ravaging Wisconsin, Minnesota, Iowa and 

              other agricultural states garnered scant attention during the 2000 

              presidential campaign that yielded a George W. Bush presidency, 

              so it came as no surprise that Bush&#146;s designation of California 

              agribusiness operative Ann Veneman for the post of secretary of 

              agriculture mustered far less comment than the nomination of Attorney 

              General-designee John Ashcroft or Interior Secretary-designee Gale 

              Norton.</font>

<P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#9;Yet, 

              because of the broad authority she would be handed as agriculture 

              secretary and because of her extreme politics, Veneman could well 

              turn out to be Bush&#146;s most dangerous pick. Veneman&#146;s track 

              record suggests that, if confirmed, she will use her position as 

              head of a powerful agency with responsibility for implementing federal 

              farm policy, protecting food safety and managing public lands to 

              advance what farm activist Mark Ritchie describes as &quot;strictly 

              pro-agribusiness, pro-pesticide company, pro-pharmaceutical company 

              positions.&quot;</font></P>

<P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#9;While 

              the Clinton administration practiced malignant neglect as farm income 

              plummeted to record lows in the late 1990s, a Bush Department of 

              Agriculture under Veneman&#146;s leadership would in the view of 

              savvy farm activists mount a full frontal assault on the future 

              of family farming, food safety standards and the undeveloped wilderness.</font></P>

<P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#9;Veneman 

              has served as a key member of the Reagan and Bush administration 

              farm teams, as director of the California Department of Food and 

              Agriculture during the gubernatorial administration of agribusiness 

              favorite Pete Wilson, as an agribusiness lawyer and as a member 

              of the national steering committee of Farmers and Ranchers for Bush. 

              In those positions she has rarely missed an opportunity to promote 

              a free-trade regimen that advances the interests of international 

              food production and processing conglomerates, to encourage policies 

              that lead to the displacement of family farms with huge factory 

              farms, to open public lands for mineral extraction and timbering, 

              to support genetic modification of food and to defend biotech experimentation 

              with agriculture. Indeed, Veneman is a biotech absolutist who served 

              on the board of Calgene, the corporation that launched the first 

              genetically engineered food in 1994. Veneman told a forum last year, 

              &quot;We simply will not be able to feed the world without biotechnology.&quot;</font></P>

<P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#9;Most 

              Americans still imagine farms as family-run ventures where a measure 

              of environmental stewardship is practiced, but that sort of farming 

              is rapidly being displaced as family farmers find they no longer 

              can compete in a global market dominated by corporate agribusiness 

              monopolies. Veneman has for the better part of two decades served 

              as the point person for a so-called &quot;modern&quot; vision of 

              farming that has more to do with global-positioning satellites and 

              genetic engineering of the food supply than the tending of fields 

              and the care of animals. With Veneman&#146;s encouragement, California 

              developed a conglomerated, big-farm, chemically enhanced version 

              of food production that Iowa Farmers Union President John Whitaker 

              describes as &quot;an entirely different face of agriculture&quot; 

              from that practiced or desired by most working farmers in places 

              like Iowa and Wisconsin.</font></P>

<P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#9;&quot;I 

              don&#146;t want to see that face transferred to Iowa,&quot; says 

              Whitaker. But if Veneman gets the reins of the Department of Agriculture 

              as the Congress is preparing to rewrite the dismally flawed Freedom 

              to Farm Act &#151; which U.S. Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn., aptly 

              dubbed the &quot;Freedom to Fail Act&quot; &#151; the transfer may 

              be unavoidable. While it is true that members of the House will 

              drive the process, this will be the first time since the 1950s that 

              a Republican Congress and a Republican agriculture secretary will 

              be working in unison to implement &quot;reforms&quot; that are likely 

              to further tip the balance in favor of agribusiness conglomerates.</font></P>

<P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#9;But 

              a Secretary Veneman would not merely be hustling to deliver for 

              Bush&#146;s corporate contributors on domestic farm policy and land 

              use issues; she&#146;d also be working for them on the international 

              stage. A militant free trader with decades-old ties to the masters 

              of the new global economy, Veneman helped negotiate the Uruguay 

              round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which cleared 

              the way for development of the World Trade Organization.</font></P>

<P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#9;In 

              addition, she was actively involved in negotiating the U.S.-Canada 

              Free Trade Agreement and the North American Free Trade Agreement. 

              So determined is Veneman to advance the free-trade agenda that Bush 

              transition team aides briefly considered her as a candidate for 

              the position of U.S. trade representative before handing the keys 

              to the Department of Agriculture, with its 100,000-member staff 

              and $100 billion budget, to the woman who has already proven her 

              willingness to sacrifice the interests of American farmers on the 

              altar of trade liberalization. Even as family farmers from Wisconsin 

              and Minnesota were marching in the streets of Seattle to protest 

              WTO interference with agricultural supports and food safety standards, 

              Veneman was in Seattle to tell the WTO to move more aggressively 

              to remove so-called &quot;technical barriers to trade.&quot;</font></P>

<P align="left">

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;(Veneman) 

              has taken the most shrill, ideologically driven positions on trade 

              and agriculture,&quot; says Ritchie, the president of the Minneapolis-based 

              Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy. &quot;She seems to be 

              coming in with the notion that her job is to be as extreme as possible 

              in parroting the agribusiness line. The problem is that that line 

              is completely out of sync with what farmers want, what consumers 

              want, and what we know to be scientifically, ecologically and economically 

              right.&quot;
