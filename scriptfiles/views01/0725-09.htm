<i>To the reader: This isn't a description of what happened in Genoa -- most

people already know that, or can find out on <a href="http://www.indymedia.org/" target="new">Indymedia</a>. It's better described as a [bad] "mood piece", as I was and am feeling pretty traumatized and angry after the events.  I'd been there since Monday, July 16 for the Genoa Social Forum, participating in various debates, doing a lot of media work and left Thursday before all the trouble started (the demonstration on Thursday, centered around immigrants' rights was perfectly peaceful).</i>

<p>Are you happy, G-eighters?  Happy to get together in these palaces in

cities emptied of their inhabitants, with all that luxury and your

"security" that costs ordinary citizens a fortune?  Happy with your

unchanging and catastrophic neo-liberal policies imposed with impunity on

behalf of transnational corporations and financial markets?  Happy to make

sure that the injustice on this planet gets worse with every passing year

and G-8 meeting?  To announce your miserable little health fund amounting

to just a tenth of what poor Kofi Annan asked for last month for AIDS

alone?  To show off your eight impeccable suits-and-ties and your

self-referential gesticulations, because the only remaining purpose of your

meetings is to reaffirm that you are indeed the G-8. </p>



<p>Are you happy, cops?  Happy you finally took out a protestor?  You didn't

manage that in Gothenburg but you did this time.  A big premier in Genoa, a

legal murder.  That'll teach the little bastards.  Tear-gas, water cannon,

anti-riot gear, that's for amateurs--bullets are for real men.  Blood on

the pavement.  Crushed bodies.  Nice work.  Happy too you could raid the

alternative media center and the convergence center in the middle of the

night, smash the computers, confiscate the cassettes and club people who

were sleeping, so there wouldn't be any trace of your activities?  Bravo.</p>



<p>Are you happy, protestors?  Not the huge majority that backed the Genoa

Social Forum--I know you're devastated and some of you bloodied--nor those

many "members" of the Black Bloc who were in fact police infiltrators; but

you, the genuine Black Blockers, who never participated in any of the

preparatory meetings that went on for months, who don't belong to any of

the 700 responsible Italian organizations that had decided democratically

to practice creative and active non-violence.  Are you happy with your

unilateral actions, to have willfully infiltrated groups of peaceful

demonstrators so that they too got gassed and clubbed; happy to have

responded to police provocations which were both foreseeable and foreseen?

Are you happy we've finally got our martyr?</p> 



<p>His name was Carlo Giuliani.  He was 23 years old and he went to the

demonstration with his own convictions, that's enough, they weren't ours,

but we protest his execution, peace be with him.</p>



<p>The fact remains that this movement for a different kind of globalization

is in danger.  Either we'll be capable of exposing what the police are

actually up to and manage to contain and prevent the violent methods of the

few, or we risk shattering the greatest political hope in the last several

decades.  Whoever bears responsibility for what happened in Genoa--and it

is massively on the side of the G-8 and the police, this broad, powerful,

international movement, as irresistible as the tide; this movement of

peoples united in solidarity that we've dreamed about can no longer go

forward in the same way.  It can no longer accept that anybody can do

anything.  A man has died.</p>



<p>If we can't guarantee peaceful, creative demonstrations, workers and

official trade unions won't join us; our base will slip away, the present

unity--both trans-sectoral and trans-generational--will crumble.  We, the

immense majority with serious proposals to make; we who believe that

another world is possible, have got to act responsibly.  Faced with the

escalation of  State-sponsored terror, we must figure out how to continue

our demonstrations and direct action without endangering our people; how to

avoid abandoning the terrain of the public space to the explosive

ultra-minority.   One thing is certain: we can't give up this struggle and

we will not stop fighting against the huge injustices of present

globalization, but we shall have to find new democratic avenues to wage

this fight.</p> 



<p>Twenty-five hundred years ago, the great Chinese strategist Sun Tzu said,

"Do not do what you would most like to do.  Do what your adversary would

least like you to do."  I fear that today our adversaries are happy.  As

for me, I'm just trying to surmount the events of Genoa and not give in to

despair.</p>
