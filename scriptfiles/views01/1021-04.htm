GENEVA  --  From the start, the United States has tried to present the military 

offensive in Afghanistan as a move not simply to punish the Taliban but to 

liberate the Afghan people from the Taliban's repressive regime. Secretary of 

Defense Donald Rumsfeld repeatedly said the United States was parachuting 

humanitarian aid to the oppressed.

<P>It did not take long for one of the world's most prestigious aid 

organizations, Medecins sans Frontieres (Doctors Without Borders), to level 

sharp criticism at the U.S. air drops. Jean-Herve Bradol, president of the 

organization, speaking from Islamabad, deplored what he called "PR," focusing 

his criticism on three main points.

<P>First, he said, airdrops are a huge waste of money. The packages, 

containing enough to feed an adult for a day, land all over the place, with no 

guarantee that any, or even most, will be retrieved.

<P>And 37,500 rations per night are mere drops in the bucket in a country 

where 7 or 8 million are starving. The money ($25 million for the duration of 

the bombing, according to U.S. government sources) would be better spent 

provisioning the regular aid convoys already in action.

<P>Second, since Afghanistan is one of the most mined countries in the world, 

haphazard drops like these, if noticed by the local population, could easily 

lure people into mine fields.

<P>Finally, Bradol's main grievance is that much of the local population will 

associate -- reasonably -- the planes dropping the food with the planes 

dropping the bombs. According to Bradol, there is already a strong tendency on 

the part of many people in the region to lump together all Westerners, 

regardless of why they are there. From that, it is just one short step to 

associating all international aid staff with the newly arrived military. "We 

do not," he stated emphatically, "want to be confused with people conducting a 

military operation!"

<P>The Swiss-based humanitarian group, Terre des Hommes, has condemned the 

airdrops point-blank as "dangerous and badly targeted," calling instead for 

the opening of a humanitarian corridor to avoid what they denounce as "the 

deliberate confusion between military operations and humanitarian aid."

<P>Last May, when the various international aid agencies operating in the 

field under United Nations auspices launched an international appeal for 

Afghanistan, "a forgotten country and a forgotten people caught up in a 

forgotten war," nobody was interested. With almost no response to the appeal, 

aid agencies had to borrow from their own budgets to keep the help coming.

<P>And last November, in a speech before an international symposium, U.N. 

Secretary General Kofi Annan touched on this subject. Admitting that military 

intervention might be undertaken for humanitarian motives, he said, "Such 

military intervention should not, however, in my view, be confused with 

humanitarian action."

<P>Annan recounted an experience during the war in Kosovo, when NATO troops 

had become much engaged in relief activities: Cornelio Sommaruga, then head of 

the International Red Cross, came to him, furious, saying, "You have to do 

something. You have to tell NATO to respect the line. They are taking our 

space, and we cannot create confusion and give the impression that the same 

people who are bringing the bombs are bringing the bread."

<P>While U.N. aid agencies operating in the region are silent for the time 

being, there has been much behind-the-scenes discussion about the U.S. 

airdrops, and one highly placed U.N. agency official decried them as "a 

publicity stunt." It remains a delicate subject, however. With U.S. military 

action dominating the scene, an aid agency voicing overt criticism of the 

United States risks being sidelined and severely handicapped in its efforts.

<P>Nonetheless, the fear that aid agencies could become easy targets for those 

who see them as part of the war machine is apparently not unfounded. Following 

the first night's bombing, the headquarters of the U.N. High Commissioner for 

Refugees in Quetta, Pakistan, near the Afghan border, was pelted with stones 

from outside its surrounding wall, while the office of UNICEF (the U.N. 

Children's Fund), with no wall around it, was torched.

<P>The Red Cross's Sommaruga, in his remonstration to Annan, put it this way: 

"Ours is the bread, let them focus on the fighting or whatever they are there 

to do."
