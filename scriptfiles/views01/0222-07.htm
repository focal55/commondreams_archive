Iraqui President Saddam Hussein (known as Sah-Damn to fans of Bush the

Elder) seems intent on ruining the once prosperous country that sits in the

historic "Cradle of Civilization." Are we, the United States of America,

helping him?

<p>

Since the Gulf War, the international community has imposed economic

sanctions on Iraq. It would be nice to think that that's hurting the

government, but President Saddam Hussein--the man who used poison gas

against Kurdish families--still lives in a palace and manages to look dapper

in press conferences. Meanwhile, an estimated 1.25 million Iraquis have died

from poverty, hunger and disease due to a combination of sanctions and

government neglect. The United States has blocked Iraq from importing goods

it needs for medical supplies and generating electric power, on the grounds

they could be put to military use.

</p>

<p>

Few American news organizations have reported extensively from Iraq in

recent years, but a Boston Globe reporter in Baghdad two years ago found

"children stunted by years of malnutrition. Children who say they are 15 and

16 look more like 9- or 10-year-olds." Voices in the Wilderness is a

Chicago-based group that brings medicine to Iraq in open defiance of the

sanctions. "Economic sanctions are killing by some measures four to five

thousand children under the age of five each month," says coordinator Kathy

Kelly. She advocates a new policy: "lift sanctions, embargo military

weaponry, (provide) massive assistance to rebuild the infrastructure."

</p>

<p>

Several members of the coalition which has supported sanctions, including

France, now seem to agree with Kelly. Right now, the Iraqui lifeline is an

oil-for-food program run by the United Nations, but two of its past

administrators, Dennis Halliday and Hans van Spoeneck resigned in quick

succession from the post, dispirited over the civilian deaths. "We are in

the process of destroying an entire society. It is as simple and terrifying

as that," said Halliday, "It is illegal and immoral."  Van Spoeneck, who has

been critical of both the U.N. and the Iraqui government's role, stated,

"How long the civilian population, which is totally innocent on all this,

should be exposed to such punishment for something that they have never

done?"

</p>

<p>

And where does the United States stand? President George W. Bush says that

the raids were "part of a strategy, and until that strategy is changed, if

it is changed, we will continue to enforce them."  The Iraqui President

tends to speak more clearly than our own on matters like these. If you go to

his official website (and you better believe that every Tom, Dick, and

Saddam has a website these days), you'll find a Gulf War anniversary speech

which states: "on a day like this day ten years ago, Evil and all those who

made Satan their protector lined up in one place... the U.S... Britain,

France, Germany, Spain, Holland, Argentina, Belgium and Australia.... Shall

I continue counting or do you still remember the number: thirty-three

states, twenty-eight armies, taking the first place in the aggression upon

Iraq, and more than forty states taking charge of supporting the direct

aggression in addition to world Zionism and its freak and accursed entity?"

</p>

<p>

The question is not, was not, has never been whether or not Saddam Hussein

is a nice guy. The question has always been how the United States and the

international community should engage with him, particularly as Secretary of

State Colin Powell heads to the region later this month. The "Evil" nations

that Saddam lists in his diatriabe are weakening in their resolve to act as

one toward Iraq. The Arab states that America counts as its allies have

become frustrated with our policy of air strikes which seem like posturing

and do little to help the people of the country. And of course the Bush

administration's oil ties make it difficult to divorce the personal and the

political.

</p>

<p>

Shortly before he became the vice presidential nominee, Dick Cheney was

given a $20 million payout from his oil company employer, Halliburton. As

Secretary of Defense, Cheney bombed Iraq. But as part of Halliburton, Cheney

called for re-engaging with trade with both Iran and Iraq, and stated in a

1998 speech that "unilateral sanctions...almost never work." Of course,

sanctions have worked in cases as notable as South Africa, but in this case

they seem to be doing more to hurt the Iraqui people than to accomplish any

long-range military or political goals. We seem to have an endless supply of

smart bombs. But as for smart policy...well, let's just consider all of our

options in Iraq as we move forward. The worst case scenario? A Gulf War II

that would leave the wily Saddam Hussein in power, produce American military

casualties, and another million Iraquis dead.
