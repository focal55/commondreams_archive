Abruptly, the rocking got enough oomph behind it. Within seconds a big 

section of the fence — more than the width of the boulevard — flattened to the 

ground. Mayhem: The police started laying down tear gas at close hand. The militants,

 streaming through the gate, started throwing rocks and golf balls. Several began fighting 

 hand-to-hand with the cops. A car parked on the inside near the gate was immediately trashed. 

 As I moved across the flattened fence to the “inside” I saw flames burst out on the pavement 

 near me—a Molotov cocktail. Big rocks were flying all over. “Bush go home!” some protesters 

 shouted. They didn’t know it, but Bush was only 900 yards away.

The anti-corporate, anti-globalization war, begun with the Battle of Seattle in 1999, 

shifted over the past weekend to our neighbor to the north, once-peaceful Canada. Here 

is a diary of a reporter who accompanied a group of Maine protesters to the Summit of the 

Americas.</P>

<P>



<B>Wednesday, April 18</B></P>

<P>

As photographer Brandon Constant and I drove, in the late evening, into the quiet 

border village of Jackman, Maine, the massive timber clear-cuts on the sides of the mountains 

silently shouted something to me about the power of multinational paper companies.</P>

<P>

I had giant corporations on my mind. We were <I>en route</I> to the Quebec City Summit of the 

Americas and the expected protests against the free-trade agreement to be signed there by the 

leaders of all Western Hemisphere nations except Cuba. A major provision would place international

 corporate investment rights over national standards protecting the environment, labor unions, and 

 human rights — in the name of bringing down the barriers to the free flow of capital and accelerating

  economic development.</P>

<P>

The thousands of anti-globalization protesters gathering in Quebec, however, saw the Free Trade 

Agreement of the Americas (FTAA) as the distancing of masses of exploited working people from a rich,

 unelected, ever-larger, corporate-global <I>de facto</I> government. As if to perfectly symbolize 

 this separation, the Canadian government had built a wall of concrete and fence around much of Old 

 Quebec — which, ironically, had been originally constructed as a fortress. The wall was to keep 

 protesters away from the presidents and prime ministers — and the business elites who would be 

 allowed inside to look over their shoulders.</P>

<P>

A group of Maine activists had opened a “hospitality center” as a protester way station in a rented 

Jackman snowmobile club. Here we shared a meal of hot chili and salad with about a dozen people 

calling themselves the Dirigo Affinity</P>

<P>

Group, with whom we would be tagging along.</P>

<P>

“Jackman is loaded with cops,” said Jim Freeman. “They’re nervous as hell.” Jim, 52, intense, a 

carpenter from Verona Island, was the chief organizer of the hospitality. He wasn’t going to Quebec 

because his 30-year-old protest arrest record was too long and had items too recent. Many of the 

protesters worried about whether they’d be let across the border.</P>

<P>

Beneath a big Che Guevara poster (looking a bit out of place next to the snowmobilers’ logo), Steve 

Burke, 59, a husky graphic designer from Warren, commented on the ages of the Mainers planning to stay

 in a rented cross-country ski chalet outside the city. “The older crew is always there,” he said, 

 looking around at fellow veterans of sixties’ activism. “But what’s delightful is that young people 

 will be there too. I had given up — then Seattle happened. It just appeared out of a void.”</P>

<P>

Ever since the Seattle protests against the World Trade Organization, very disparate groups of people 

have been uniting against a common enemy of an international corporate system whose appetite, they 

feel, is insatiable. Of the 100 largest economies in the world, 51 are now corporations; only 49 are 

countries, says the Institute for Policy Studies. Privatization of public services and deregulation 

continue worldwide. For example, under the already-in-force North American Free Trade Agreement 

(NAFTA), the shipping corporation UPS has been allowed to sue the Canadian postal system for unfair 

competition, and an American corporation has collected damages from a Mexican state ($16.7 million) 

because its tough environmental regulations were deemed to hinder free trade.</P>

<P>

<B>Thursday, April 19</B>

<P>

The next morning, cool and sunny, the Canadian border authorities were ready for our little caravan 

with their forces beefed up by, among others, a public relations officer. After a thorough search of 

our cars, brief individual questioning, and computer background checks, to our relief we were all let

 in except for a white-haired, bespectacled electrician who had a drunk-driving conviction in 1969. 

 “I’m sure they’ll let George Bush in,” one member of the group muttered.</P>

<P>

Arriving in Quebec City in the early afternoon, Brandon and I headed up the hill to take a close look

 at the wall. Decorated on the outside with signs such as “Bienvenue à Berlin, 1989”, it protected a 

 section of hotels, office buildings, and cafés where, for the next three days, the dignitaries and 

 accredited media would do their thing. Down the streets and sidewalks in this forbidden zone it 

 looked like a neutron bomb had gone off, leaving little life but all property intact. The area’s

  residents had been required to get passes to go to their own homes.</P>

<P>

To keep the police guessing, the organizers of the Women’s March scheduled for this evening had not

 planned where it would end. But at the Boulevard René Lévesque access point there were

  <I>beaucoup</I> news media, called by the march leaders and told this was the place to be. Several 

  members of the Canadian Parliament representing the quasi-socialist New Democratic Party (NDP) were 

  here protesting the Quebec wall as well as the FTAA. These two items could be linked because the 

  free-trade agreement’s provisions had been negotiated behind closed doors. But “if you are a big 

  corporation you can buy yourself into the summit” by “sponsoring” part of it, said Libby Davies, a

   member of parliament from Vancouver.</P>

<P>



Just at dusk, a colorful, chanting group of about 350 women came down the boulevard to the gate, 

which was open for the occasional car or pedestrian. The gate was guarded by only seven police 

officers standing in a line. A huge earth-mother puppet hovered over the marchers. Many of the Maine 

women and men of the Dirigo group were in the march. “It’s like climbing Cadillac Mountain,” said 

Peter Robbins, 53, a builder from Sedgwick, of the city’s hills.</P>

<P>

Two of the march leaders spoke to the sole female police officer. They very politely said they 

intended to put banners on the wall’s fence. The policewoman said she had no problem with that. Then

 followed wave after wave of often-colorfully-dressed women affixing banners (“Another World Is 

 Possible”) and beautiful “webs” made of various fabrics, ribbons, and collages. The webs symbolized 

 an alternative concept of globalization, linking people to people instead of corporation to 

 corporation. I was skeptical of the effect of this very soft protest on the hard-nosed, male summit 

 politicians. I wondered if this is what the weekend would be like.</P>

<P>

José Bové, the famous French anti-globalization activist who with friends had bulldozed a McDonald’s 

in his home region, was speaking at a nearby arts center. His topic: the best kind of tactics for 

effective political action. In the small hall, about 70 people sat in a large circle. Bové, disarming

 with a relaxed manner, felt that political action could include the destruction of property, but it

  should be done, referring to the activism he had participated in, only by people who are directly 

  affected by what they are protesting and willing to go to prison. And such action has to be very 

  public. The destruction of the McDonald’s, he said, was like the Boston Tea Party — which was “an 

  economic struggle against a tea company. Just to break a window doesn’t have a lot of meaning.”

  </P>

<P>

<B>Friday, April 20</B></P>

<P>

After rising in a ski dormitory on the still-snowy sides of Mont Sainte-Anne about 20 miles out of 

town, I connected with the couple of dozen students from the University of Maine and Bates and Colby 

Colleges who were sharing the Auberge du Fondeur with the older group. Brandon had left for the city

 45 minutes earlier with a protester. Hoping to catch up later with the students, I drove back along 

 the shining Saint Lawrence to the official media center, where I received my pass and a nifty black

  shoulder bag paid for by Canadian Pacific. I was in Quebec to cover the protests, but I wanted to

   contrast them with the official events. I drove without difficulty through a police checkpoint 

   into the zone where my car would be protected by the 6,500 police and 1,200 army troops said to be 

   in the neighborhood.</P>

<P>

The summit’s Media Centre was in a vast, black room. Supposedly, 3,000 accredited journalists were 

covering these meetings. Denys Tessier, the summit’s chief p.r. man, explained to me the corporate 

sponsorship program. A donation of more than $500,00 placed your company in the Diamond category, 

more than $250,000 in Platinum, and so on. These donations allowed executives to be admitted to the 

highest-level receptions and dinners to hob-nob with President Bush, Canada’s Prime Minister Jean 

Chrétien, and the rest of the hemisphere’s leaders. Among corporations taking advantage of this 

program were Cisco Systems, Sun Microsystems, and Verizon. As I questioned him, Tessier pointedly 

made several references to the freebie hung on my shoulder. Not feeling too guilty, I strolled over 

to a side room and helped myself to the excellent, free buffet.</P>

<P>

The accredited, “official” journalists here were largely focused on what the officials were saying.

 This, to them, defined the news. To further tighten their focus, they were largely relegated to 

 transcribing handouts and speaking with press attachés. All summit events were closed to the press

  or open only to a very small pool of reporters. A lot of people seemed to be doing their work by 

  watching the big-screen TVs above the giant Cisco Systems booth that now were showing Bush’s arrival

   in Quebec. The Media Centre was a well-controlled virtual reality.</P>

<P>

Wanting to see a more real reality, I exited and walked in the sunshine to the René Lévesque gate, 

where I had been the night previous. Now I was on the other side of it. About 300 protesters with 

signs milled about. Just a few police officers — in riot gear — stood well back from the gate. It was

 closed, so I had to walk a few blocks to a quieter gate, where the police let me through, and I

  walked back to René Lévesque on the “outside.” A person in an anarchist group from the city’s Laval

   University was holding up a sign with what became my favorite slogan of the weekend, a takeoff on

    Descartes’ formulation of human identity: “Je Pense, Donc Je Nuis” (I Think, Therefore I Harm). 

    “Let me into the meeting!” one person yelled loudly over the fence. A group of “witches” arrived 

    to put a hex on the summit.</P>

<P>

By 2:50 p.m., about 500 people had collected. A small group of young protesters began rocking the 

gate’s two layers of fence. There were still only about 20 police staying 40 feet back on the inside.

 People began louder chants. The mood changed. One young man climbed to the top and positioned himself

  between the two fences. As his comrades whipped the gate back and forth, he tried to kick the inner 

  fence in. I thought he’d break his legs. The cops put on their gas masks.</P>

<P>

About 3 p.m., I turned around and saw hundreds more protesters arriving. Many were dressed in black, 

carried red flags, and wore gas masks. A young woman tried to divert them: “Let’s talk about the FTAA,

” she yelled. These new folks weren’t interested in talk. They started throwing water bottles over 

the fence at the police, then sticks they had brought. Now a couple of thousand people were here. 

Several hundred were from a group called the Black Block — anarchists or communist revolutionaries.

 The police behind the gate now numbered about 40, although a contingent of about 25 riot cops in 

 full Darth Vader battle gear with german shepherd dogs suddenly appeared in the park to the side of

  the protesters.</P>

<P>

After the quick, surprising destruction of the fence, a big fight ensued in the open gate between 

dozens of militants and the police, who became a lot more numerous and began laying down a lot more 

tear gas. I thought that if I watched things from behind the police maybe the gas wouldn’t come my 

way. I put on a bandanna as protection. My eyes and face were stinging, but it seemed tolerable. 

Then a canister exploded near me. I got hit hard. My eyes were on fire. I couldn’t breath. I felt 

very sick. With some other press people — they were not all at the Media Centre — I stumbled blindly 

though a snow bank to get around a building — anything to get out of the gas.</P>

<P>

On the other side of the street was an English-Canadian TV cameraman I had talked with the night 

before. “Now you know why I don’t want to live in Quebec,” he said when I went over to him. His car 

had been smashed, the windows and doors broken in. He had a bloody nose and a cut hand from fighting 

with the militant who had been laying it to the car. He had somehow driven the car a block out of 

further harm’s way. This was not virtual reality.</P>

<P>

Now a lengthy pitched battle began — to last for days — the images of which would go worldwide: 

phalanxes of 50 to 100 riot police trying to push back, outmaneuver, and intimidate the protesters; 

militants silhouetted within clouds of <I>gaz lacrymogène</I> as they bravely threw fuming canisters 

back over the fence; police helicopters roaring overhead, water cannons dousing the militants; streets

 littered with rocks.</P>

<P>

But the opportunity had passed forever for the Black Block to storm the convention center. The police 

had overestimated the strength of the wall, and they had underestimated the force needed at this 

crucial checkpoint. If hundreds of determined militants had rushed past the thin line of cops in the 

first few minutes after the flattening of the fence, they wouldn’t have been stopped. Independent 

affinity groups and anarchy are great to prevent the infiltration of dreaded hierarchy, but from a

 purely military standpoint some planning would have been useful. Of course, if they had really 

 threatened the convention center, the militants probably would have been shot. </P>

<P>

I tried to get back to the protesters’ side at another gate, but it was shut down. I wanted to see 

how the press center was handling the battle, so I walked back down the boulevard, passing a wounded

 cop being put into an ambulance. The press entrance was locked up tight. Gas stung the eyes 

 everywhere in this eerily quiet district. When I tried to enter through another side of the building

  a policeman told me that if I went in I wouldn’t be allowed out. The official press had been 

  imprisoned. </P>

<P>

I went back to the Lévesque gate just before workers started re-erecting the fence — reinforcing 

it with concrete-based, diagonal supports. I quickly scooted over and walked through the police where

 the gas was lightest. There, on the front line of the protesters, equally surprised to see me, was 

 Brandon. He gave me a film canister of vinegar to soak my bandanna to lessen the impact of the tear 

 gas.</P>

<P>

In back of the street fighters, the crowd was surreal. Next to green-spiked young women in beaded 

leather jackets getting their eyes flushed out were middle-class, middle-aged couples joining in the 

chants. I saw one old woman pushing a walker to get a better look at the nearest squad of police. I 

urged an old man with a cane to move away from the action, since I could guarantee him, given the 

constant ebb and flow of the gas, it was going to come his way. One guy complained to me he’d never

 get inside the <I>périmètre</I> to pick up his kids for the weekend. Meanwhile, the revolutionary 

 types in gas masks were constantly taunting and charging and running away from the police.</P>

<P>

Diane Germain, 48, a Québécoise with a Ph.D. who worked in an environmental consulting firm, saw my 

press badge and came up to tell me about how FTAA would destroy local economies. “Two weeks ago I 

knew a little about the subject. Now I am much stronger about it,” she said proudly. The protest 

organizers’ lessons about approaching the press had been very effective.</P>

<P>

Unlike in some other protests I had seen, everyone, including the many gawkers, seemed to be at least

 somewhat sympathetic with the bold militants. When one of them would make a particularly good return

  of a tear gas canister over the wall, huge cheers would go up. From patrons in the nearby stylish

   Rue Cartier outdoor cafés, the police received the utmost sarcasm as they trooped up the street 

   in a flanking maneuver. There was a lot of “<I>so-so-so-li-dar-i-té</I>,” as I heard chanted often.

    The construction of the hated wall had forced many ordinary Quebec City citizens to think more 

    deeply about the politics of the summit. This wall going up had brought some walls down. </P>

<P>

About 9 p.m., during a lull in the fighting, I finally got back inside the press center. Many in the 

news media were comfortably watching video of the battle on the big screens. Diane Lindquist of the 

<I>San Diego Union Tribune</I> later told me “there wasn’t much of a hue and cry” about the press 

lock-up when the Quebec City police chief had appeared at a news conference.</P>

<P>

About 11 p.m., I ventured forth to watch a particularly intense shooting of a water cannon and tear 

gas down a narrow street on a steep hill. I was beginning to lose hope that I would get my car out 

through the perimeter. I had lost hope that I would see any of the Maine protesters. After a while,

 I started back to the Media Centre. Suddenly, out of the darkness a cloud of tear gas descended on

  me. My bandanna had no effect. Choking and barely able to see, I made it to the back of the

   convention center, tried to head up the hill to the media entrance, then turned back and went 

   in the door of the office of the convention center parking garage.</P>

<P>

“You can’t come in here,” the security guard told me in French.</P>

<P>

“I’ve just got to get away from the gas,” I struggled to say.<i> “Aidez-moi. Je suis journaliste.”

</i></P>

<P>

I lucked out. He was a kindly fellow. He let me rest in a chair and even brought me water to put

 in my eyes. When I recovered I tried to leave several times, but the tear gas was too intense. 

 When once I finally made it as far as the Media Centre door, it was locked. I went back and persuaded

  the guard to let me go up an escalator to a shopping mall area that had been taken over by the Royal

   Canadian Mounted Police as their command post. He probably figured I couldn’t do much harm among 

   all those Mounties. Upstairs, the RCMP told me that the perimeter had been closed for the night. 

   There was no chance of my getting out.</P>

<P>

I resigned myself to sipping beer all night in a bar in the bowels of the building. It was open for 

the use of off-duty police and army personnel. Without a gas mask, it was impossible to go outside. 

As I watched live TV coverage of the continuing Battle of Quebec, I chatted with a friendly bartender

 and young soldier. When my situation fully sunk into them, the bartender convinced the young guy to

  try to see if the army couldn’t put me up. A little while later, at about 2 a.m., the soldier drove

   me in a van a few blocks to the YMCA — located next to the hotel Bush was staying in — which the

    troops had taken over for barracks. I fell asleep on a cot in a sleeping bag in a room with 35 

    snoring soldiers. George W. could rest peacefully: The Canadian Army and I were close at hand.</P>

<P>

<B>Saturday, April 21</B></P>

<P>

On a beautiful, fresh dawn gloriously free of tear gas I walked along the fortifications of 

400-year-old Vieux Québec. Only a few photographers and squads of cops were about. One very 

forlorn-looking protester sat facing a line of riot police near the Rue Saint-Jean access point. I 

found my car and drove to our lodgings in the mountains.</P>

<P>

“I’m so energized! I’m so enthusiastic!” exclaimed Emily Posner, a Colby College sophomore who had 

just woken up. She was describing her reaction to yesterday’s events at the René Lévesque gate. “The

 amount of militarization in our society — it’s impressive that they can do that . . . It’s chemical 

 warfare.</P>

<P>

“I was excited to the extent that the activists were having a disruptive effect,” said Ethan Miller, 

23, also of Colby. “Even people who are throwing rocks, if given the opportunity, can articulate a

 political stance. I’d give them more credit that the press gives them.”</P>

<P>

Missy Smith, 21, a Bates junior, described how she saw the police fire tear gas right into a fellow

 student as they were putting up a banner on the fence.</P>

<P>

The rather widespread acceptance of “violence” was striking. As I had heard on Canadian radio on the

 way back to the ski lodge, some of the Quebec protest organizers were deploring it as 

 counterproductive. But on the troop level, the revolutionaries and the nonviolent protesters were 

 perhaps closer than these leaders imagined. “Look at the violence of the police and of 

 globalization!” so many people told me when I brought up the subject of the Black Block’s activities.

 </P>

<P>

Back on the Quebec streets that afternoon, the scraggly lines of revolutionaries (sometimes known as 

“anti-capitalists”) slowly trudged up Boulevard René Levesque in black cargo pants and black hooded 

sweatshirts, grimy backpacks, and black bandannas as if they were going to work — another day of 

street fighting. I was struck by how physically unimpressive these ragged, improbable combatants 

were. Most were in their teens and seemed small in stature. And why were so many so skinny, I asked

 Brandon? “They tend to be vegans,” he thought. They were greeted with a bemused respect by the more

  conventional protesters — not with fear.</P>

<P>

High-trajectory gas cans rained down on us haphazardly. Snowballs were thrown back in response. I

 noticed the police dogs’ handlers could make them bark on cue. A bank’s windows had all been smashed

  out. A young man who would only identify himself as John, a college student from Ontario, told me

   breathlessly: “It’s really encouraging if every time the leaders get together there’s a 

   <I>manifestation</I>!” </P>

<P>

Meanwhile, a set of huge, peaceful, chanting marches — the press consensus was 30,000 people 

participated — also took place. Because of the organizers’ alarms over the violence, they were led 

away from the wall. As I later learned from one of our Maine group who participated in a march, this

 was disappointing to a lot of the walkers. A good number, especially from the labor union march, 

 broke off to head for the more aggressive protests. I saw one of these break-away groups and 

 estimated it to have at least 5,000 people.</P>

<P>

Late that night in Jackman, on our way home, we stopped for a hearty supper at the hospitality house.

 Over 360 meals had been served to protesters so far, the chief cook said. At the border, a protest 

 in sympathy with Quebec and a brief, permitted “blockade” earlier that day had been successful. 

 About 75 people had participated.</P>

<P>

A busload of Maine unionists was also scarfing up the food. Several told me that, although they

 hadn’t wanted to experience the tear gas themselves, they felt solidarity with the young radicals.

  A unionist who had been in Seattle, Burt Wartell, editor of the <I>Maine Labor News</I>, said the

   walls had been broken down between the environmentalists and unions because, simply, both groups

    had finally realized that the corporations exploiting both labor and the environment were a 

    common enemy.</P>

<P>

<B>Sunday, April 22</B></P>

<P>

When the Summit of the Americas issued its final communiqué, it recognized the protesters — and, 

implicitly, the militants who had attracted so much attention — by promising the need for a nation 

to be democratic in order to be a member in good standing of the forthcoming FTAA. But as President 

Bush flew home, the <I>New York Times</I> reported he was already beginning to hedge on the 

communiqué. The eventual final FTAA agreement should include “no codicils to destroy the spirit of 

free trade,” he was quoted as saying.</P>

<P>

The walls had gone up in Quebec, literally and figuratively, between the government and the corporate

 elite and the citizens, between their police and the people, and, I felt, between the sequestered 

 official press and the events in the street.</P>

<P>

But walls also had come down: between radicals and unionists, between radicals and regular folks,

 and between young and old.</P>

<P>

The outcome of this continuing war is extremely uncertain. But the fighting was almost festive in 

Quebec. There really was a lot of <I>solidarité</I> among greatly different protesters and 

sympathizers. The joyous tones of Pink Floyd’s stirring anthem “The Wall” were heard from many 

an open window. </P>
