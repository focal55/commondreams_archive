Pay attention to President Bush’s Social Security Commission.  It says that 

Social Security has big problems.  One of the commission’s proposals is 

investing some of the Social Security Trust Fund in financial markets.



<p>The commission claims that the Social Security system will come under 

increasing strain because of retiring baby boomers.  They will swamp the 

system.  Some in the corporate media agree.



<p>“Reforms are needed because the program will go broke by 2037,” reported the 

USA Today last May 2 when the president named his Social Security 

Commission.  But economist Doug Henwood has a different opinion on the 

Social Security bankruptcy crisis.



<p>“Projections of Social Security’s bankruptcy are based on gloomy assumptions 

about economic growth--1.4 percent over the next 75 years,” according to 

Henwood.  In his view, the factor to focus on for the long-term financing of 

Social Security is not the ratio of beneficiaries to workers, but the growth 

of Gross Domestic Product (GDP).



<p>GDP growth “will determine how much money is available to pay retirees,” 

Henwood said.  “The bankruptcy scenario is based on an assumption (by the 

Social Security system’s trustees) that GDP will grow at a rate seen only in 

depression decades.”



<p>Given this dire assumption, it is unclear how financial markets could be a 

cure for what is supposed to ail Social Security down the road.  If 

anything, a depression-like scenario would seem to be a reason for staying 

the current course.



<p>Moreover, financial markets are unstable, hardly “rock-solid.”  There could 

be a major difference in the payout for retirement, survivors' benefits or a 

disabling injury from Social Security funds invested in financial markets.



<p>On a related note, Social Security funds invested in government bonds are 

stable as long as the U.S. government exists.  Social Security has never 

missed a payment to retirees, survivors or those disabled and away from 

work.  Social Security is stable also because it spreads risk just like 

Allstate, State Farm and other insurance companies.



<p>By contrast, financial markets can crash and burn.  Since summer 1997, 

financial markets have fallen in Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, the 

Philippines, South Korea and Russia.



<p>Financial crises are common to capitalism.  If U.S. financial markets 

tumble, Social Security Trust Funds invested in them could leave the 

American public holding the (empty) bag.



<p>The recent Enron Corp. meltdown should serve as a warning to the American 

people on the perils of financial markets.  They are the problem, not the 

solution, for Social Security.
