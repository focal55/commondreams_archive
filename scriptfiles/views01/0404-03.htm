The 

        U.S. veto of a UN Security Council resolution calling for the deployment 

        of unarmed monitors to the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip demonstrates 

        the new administration's contempt for human rights. The United States 

        was the only country to vote against the resolution, which came before 

        the Security Council on March 28 after five days of tortuous negotiations 

        that moderated the wording of the original draft. Still, this was not 

        enough for the U.S., which vetoed its first UN Security Council resolution 

        in five years.

<p>The call for international monitors has grown over the past six months 

        as reports by Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, and the Israeli 

        group B'tselem have documented a pattern of gross and systematic human 

        rights violations by Israeli occupation forces against the Palestinian 

        population. These have included detention without charge, torture, extrajudicial 

        killings, rocket and mortar attacks against civilian targets, demolition 

        of Palestinian homes, restrictions of movement, and numerous acts of collective 

        punishment.</p>

<p>Bush administration officials claim that monitors should not be deployed 

        without Israel's consent. However, the monitors would not be going to 

        Israel. Instead they would be assigned to Israeli-occupied Palestinian 

        territory and areas controlled by the Palestinian Authority, so no Israeli 

        consent is required. The recently vetoed UN resolution did not call for 

        a peacekeeping force but rather for a team of monitors to observe and 

        report on human rights abuses.</p>

<p>Although claims and counterclaims have been made by the propaganda machinery 

        on both sides of the issue, providing an internationally sanctioned, neutral 

        monitoring group was a very modest proposal. It could have shed some light 

        on the ongoing Israeli-Palestinian conflict and could have served as a 

        deterrent against further violence and repression. The U.S. veto raises 

        the question: What does the Bush administration fear about what such a 

        monitoring group might reveal?</p>

<p>Perhaps there was concern that the monitors might note how U.S. military 

        hardware--ostensibly sent to Israel for that country's legitimate security 

        needs--was actually being used for attacks against civilians. Perhaps 

        there was fear of raising awareness that U.S. arms sent to Israel--like 

        U.S. arms sent to Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Egypt, Morocco, and other Middle 

        Eastern allies of the United States--are not furthering peace and security, 

        but rather are promoting violence and repression. These arms shipments 

        to repressive governments in the Middle East bring in billions of dollars 

        to American arms exporters, which would be in jeopardy if human rights 

        considerations were taken into account. Whatever the reason, the veto 

        has put the U.S. government at odds with almost the entire international 

        community.</p>

<p>It's particularly disappointing to human rights activists that most congressional 

        Democrats have declined to criticize the Republican administration's action 

        at the UN. Even members of the Human Rights Caucus in the House of Representatives 

        have not questioned the veto. With no pressure coming from Capitol Hill, 

        the Bush administration will have little incentive to change its anti-human 

        rights stance in the Middle East and elsewhere.</p>

<p>Wednesday's veto may be just the beginning of the Bush administration's 

        efforts to restrict UN efforts to defend human rights. President George 

        W. Bush's appointee as U.S. representative to the United Nations is John 

        Negroponte who, as ambassador to Honduras during the 1980s, covered up 

        widespread human rights abuses by U.S.-trained Honduran army units, and 

        withheld from Congress evidence of large-scale human rights violations 

        by the U.S.-backed government.</p>

<p>Public opinion polls indicate that the vast majority of Americans believe 

        that human rights are important and should be a major focus of U.S. foreign 

        policy, even if the perpetrator of human rights violations is an important 

        U.S. ally. Thus far, however, as with popular concerns about the environment, 

        the Bush administration appears quite willing to ignore the sentiments 

        of the American public.</p>

<p>It will be very difficult for the United States to speak out against 

        human rights abuses in Iraq, Iran, China, or any other country as long 

        as it protects its allies from international criticism or scrutiny. Global 

        leadership requires that principles sometimes must be placed above ideology. 

        Otherwise, the United States will find itself with fewer friends and a 

        growing number of enemies in an increasingly violent world.</p>
