While the dead and missing toll rose toward 7000 people and the stock market

suffered it's largest week's loss since the great depression due to the

terrorist attack on the symbols of U.S. economic and military power, the

stock of the weapon and surveillance industries zoomed.    The 401 (k)

retirement plans of U.S. citizens took  their biggest one week hit ever as

the Dow Jones fell 14.3% last week, but the big winners of the week were the

weapons industry, who were the top eight corporations in percentage increase

in the price of their stock.



<p>These Merchants of Death increased their stock's value from 39.9% for Armor

Holdings, Inc, who specialize in bullet resistant vests and flax jackets to

armored vehicles and sells them to government agencies and multinational

corporations, to 21.2 % for Northrop Grumman Corporation, who sell killing

tools like the B-2 stealth bomber, warships, and battlefield surveillance

systems and is a 15 billion dollar company with 80,000 employees.  Other

members of the money-making-from-misery elite from last week's market

included: Raytheon(meaning light of the gods), whose stock rose 37% and who

sell 66% of their aerospace products to the U.S. Department of Defense;

L-3 Communications Holdings, Inc. whose stock gained 35.8% from America's

loss because they make specialized communications systems for satellite,

avionics, and marine communications with the U.S. Department of Defense

accounting for 63% of the company's business;  EDO Corporation whose stock

gained 24.8 % during the week of war talk and boasts of products that are

used on land , sea and in space that they sell to the U.S. Defense

Department for 70% of their revenues; Alliant Techsystems Inc.(ATK), stock

soared 23.5% last week because they sell about 75% of their gunpowder, smart

bombs, tank mines, and rocket propulsion systems and other war-making

products  to the U.S. Government.



<p>Meanwhile, the fear-of-terror syndrome caused security companies' stock on

NASDAQ to soar.  InVision Technologies and ICTS International rose 195.5%

and 103.4% respectively. They offer magnetic resonance imaging to check

baggage and risk analysis.  Visage Technologies went up 175.8% because they

develop "biometric" technologies such as face recognition and fingerprint

imaging with "instantaneous" surveillance applications that have an

Orwellian aura.



<p>The market for weaponry and surveillance is created by anger, hate and fear.

The successful terrorist attack on the ultimate symbols of the United

State's sole-super-power status, our  economic and military might, has

fueled the flames of fear and ignited the passions of patriotism.  With U.S.

leadership threatening the world with Star Wars and  arrogantly dissing and

ditching long-sought-after-agreements on global climate change, germ

warfare, land mines, small weapons,  rights of children, and criminal

justice, our global hegemony has been cunningly challenged by murderous

Muslim martyrs armed with knives and box-cutters.  Their mysterious

mastermind is said to be a CIA-trained terrorist named Osama bin Laden, a

Saudi Arabian from a wealthy family, who has lived like a nomad among the

poor people  in the Middle East and Africa and in Afghanistan.  He is said

to be  under the protection of the Taliban ruling religious sect in

Afghanistan which was put into power by the U.S. to "stabilize" the area

against the Russians.



<p>While U. S. public opinion surveys say that more than 90% of the people

support the President in the "war against terrorism", many of us are finally

beginning to question U.S. policies that are causing the deaths of thousands

of innocent people,  including children, in places like Iraq, the West Bank

and Gaza.  In Iraq the United Nations Children's Fund(UNICEF) reported in a

1999 study that without the U.S. led military action and economic sanctions

imposed against Iraq there would have been half a million fewer deaths of

children under five from 1991 to 1998.  On the West Bank and in Gaza high

tech U.S. weaponry has been killing Arabs for decades.  Are we taxpaying

United States' citizens innocent?



<p>All the people  in the United States are people whose ancestors migrated

from just about everywhere in the world or were either brought here as

slaves.  Even the Native Americans are thought to have come to this

continent from elsewhere.  "Americans" are people of all races, religions,

and ethnic groups who share so many more basic human needs with people

everywhere than differences.  We have no differences worth killing one more

person over, anywhere.  We must call the hands of the Merchants of Death and

make them realize that war profits are false prosperity.  Let's stop the

killing now!
