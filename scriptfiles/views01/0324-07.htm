It's 

        hard for Americans, even progressive Americans, to imagine a future in 

        which the U.S. is no longer the &quot;indispensable country.&quot; This 

        is as true when it comes to climate politics as it is in any other area, 

        and for much the same reason: the U.S. looms so large that it simply cannot 

        be ignored. We emit, in particular, such a high share of world's carbon 

        that, in the end, any climate regime to which we do not immediately subscribe 

        is doomed to failure.</p>

<p align="left"> Or so, at least, it seems. Which is why the history of 

        the climate talks is in large part a history of attempts to placate America. 

        Which is, again, a big part of the reason why the Kyoto negotiations--and 

        the Kyoto Protocol itself--are in such a sorry state. The fact of the 

        matter is that, barring sudden deliverance by a new energy revolution 

        on a computer-boom scale, the U.S. as we know it today will refuse any 

        climate treaty even remotely appropriate to the threat. The fossil-fuel 

        lobby is just too powerful here. Which is why, perversely and quite inadvertently, 

        the Bush administration may have just done the world a colossal favor.</p>

<p align="left"> The &quot;Four Pollutants&quot; bill that George Bush has 

        just repudiated was as clever as anything the Washington environmental 

        corps could ever hope to contrive. It lumped carbon dioxide in with sulfur 

        dioxide, nitrogen oxide, and mercury--all &quot;traditional&quot; air 

        pollutants that not even a Republican can afford to overtly ignore--and 

        in so doing it promised a form of carbon regulation that was both low 

        profile and business friendly. It was the kind of bill that gives pragmatism 

        a good name, and for a while it even looked like it would work. When EPA 

        Administrator Christine Todd Whitman flew off to the G8 confab, she told 

        her counterparts that Bush intended to set &quot;mandatory reduction targets&quot; 

        for several pollutants, including carbon dioxide. The Europeans were, 

        according to reports, pleasantly surprised. Was it possible that the new 

        American administration wouldn't be total Neanderthals after all? </p>

<p align="left"> There was, no doubt, a bit of pixilated hope, in Berlin 

        as in Washington. Maybe Bush would surprise us all and do a &quot;Nixon 

        to China!&quot; After all, the U.S. under Clinton had (almost) negotiated 

        a tough deal at The Hague. What if the Bush administration decided to 

        support it? It sounds crazy today, but not long ago you could find seasoned 

        enviros willing to argue that Bush was surprisingly green, and indeed 

        that he was set to regulate carbon. And if he decided to support Kyoto, 

        Bush, unlike either Clinton or Gore, could actually deliver the Senate. 

        Right? </p>

<p align="left"> Well, goodbye to all that.</p>

<p align="left"> Fortunately, there's another strategy brewing in Europe, 

        and now, after Bush's climate back flip, it just might get a proper hearing. 

        The idea, suddenly hot from London to Berlin, is a &quot;European Leadership 

        Initiative.&quot; Its core is that Europe can now cut the chain binding 

        it to Washington and move toward Kyoto's ratification, while looking South, 

        and East, and working to build a coalition that might actually get the 

        Protocol over the top and into international law--a coalition that, at 

        least initially, does not contain the United States.</p>

<p align="left"> Kyoto, crucially, is written so that no single party can 

        torpedo it. If Europe and the G77/China could move toward ratification, 

        and if they could fill out the Kyoto rules so that the Russians and the 

        Japanese can eventually come along, they would have started a whole new 

        ball game. This is all the more true because such a European/G77 ratification 

        coalition would be under tremendous pressure from the very beginning. 

        To hold it together, the Europeans would have to find ways to approach 

        the so-far-untouchable capstone issue--the terms of the inevitable allocation 

        in which each nation, rich and poor, is granted a fair share of the atmosphere's 

        limited carbon-absorption capacity. They don't necessarily have to engage 

        the details, not yet, but they have to clearly signal that when push comes 

        to shove, and it will, Europe will stand with the South on the essential 

        issue of &quot;fairness.&quot;</p>

<p align="left"> Not long after the American elections, I asked Hermann 

        Ott--Climate Policy head of Germany's influential Wuppertal Institute 

        and a key enviro voice in the German foreign office--if he thought Bush's 

        ascension would rouse Europe's elites to support a Leadership Initiative. 

        The Hague talks (officially known as COP6) had just deadlocked and the 

        green diplomats were scurrying around trying to organize a rematch--the 

        &quot;COP 6bis&quot; meeting now scheduled for July. The new American 

        administration was, however, requesting a delay, and Ott was pessimistic: 

        &quot;With all this talk about postponement of COP 6bis I fear that the 

        Europeans are already retreating again.&quot; </p>

<p align="left"> Which is of course was no surprise: ever since World War 

        II, the Europeans have always buckled under U.S. pressure. They're always 

        retreating, and retreating again, and why would anything be different 

        this time around? </p>

<p align="left"> Maybe because the Bush people have been just a bit too 

        clumsy, just a bit too bald. Because at the brink of Kyoto's collapse, 

        the U.S. has chosen to give it a push. The Japanese, who actively want 

        to ratify Kyoto, are reportedly upset, and &quot;upset&quot; is too mild 

        a word for the comments coming from European leaders. No wonder, then, 

        that the friends of the European Leadership strategy are coming out of 

        the closet like never before. Suddenly, and this is new, there's open 

        talk is of going forward without the U.S. For example, Rainer Hinrichs-Rahlwes, 

        the German environmental minister, recently told reporters that &quot;maybe 

        it will be necessary to ratify the [Kyoto] protocol without the U.S. and 

        to instead pave the way for them to join later.&quot;</p>

<p align="left"> The U.S. administration is quite unperturbed. On March 

        16th, the <i>Washington Post</i> quoted Philip Reeker, a State Department 

        spokesman, speaking these hoary words: &quot;Our message to other parties, 

        and that includes European countries, is they shouldn't make any assumptions 

        about our policy until our review is complete.&quot; Which is, as the 

        Brits say, a load of bollocks. Clearly, the U.S. is going to play its 

        old game, coming on strong and hoping that the Europeans fold and give 

        them everything: unlimited sinks, unlimited trading, nuclear, and all 

        the rest of it. </p>

<p align="left"> Or maybe this'll get even worse. Some European NGO analysts 

        fear that this July, at COP 6bis, the Bush people are going to go for 

        broke, and loudly insist that the Kyoto Protocol, and entire process that 

        led to it, is unfair to the United States. In Bush's letter to Senator 

        Hagel--the one in which he announced that he wouldn't be regulating carbon 

        dioxide after all--he averred that &quot;I oppose the Kyoto Protocol because 

        it exempts 80% of the world.&quot; And why wouldn't the Bush people just 

        continue in the same vein? The climate community won't buy it--count historical 

        emissions, and the 20% of the world covered by Kyoto is responsible for 

        80% of the problem--but the Republicans know it plays in Peoria.</p>

<p align="left"> This is going to get worse before it gets better, but it's 

        important to see that it could indeed get better, and maybe soon. This 

        is particularly so because the politics of the climate negotiations are 

        closely suggestive of just the sorts of &quot;balance of power&quot; problems 

        that weigh so heavily in traditional &quot;realist&quot; thought. As the 

        world's only superpower, the U.S. is free to focus on its internal political 

        dynamics, free to be unilateralist--but the U.S., it must be remembered, 

        is not quite the hegemon it used to be. And if the Bush people overplay 

        their hand, if they come to COP 6bis talking about the need for the developing 

        countries to accept emission-limits before the U.S. can accept any of 

        its own, then it will finally be the hour of decision for Europe, and 

        for all the rest of the U.S.'s allies besides. Because if the South is 

        left to stand alone against such a charge, well, the whole Kyoto Process 

        would go down in flames.</p>

<p align="left"> It's a dangerous situation, but it's also heavy with opportunity. 

        The Bush people have thrown down the gauntlet, and it's only reasonable 

        to expect that they'll toss another when the talks resume. At a deeper 

        level, though, what happens next will depend less on the U.S. than on 

        the rest of the world, and how it, or rather its elites, face their now 

        obvious conditions of existence. The science is grim, the global economy 

        unstable, and the political field suddenly too open for old rules to suffice. 

        The Europeans will probably go along with the Bush crowd, for the habits 

        of servility die hard. But, crucially, they may not. The fact is that 

        European servility no longer makes geopolitical sense, and that the trans-Atlantic 

        tensions engendered by U.S. climate politics join a growing portfolio 

        of friction points on issues as disjoint as nuclear missile defense and 

        genetically modified foods. Besides, when hegemons overreach, anti-hegemonic 

        alliances become possible. They sometimes become necessary as well, but 

        necessity, as we all know, or should, becomes a force only when people 

        recognize and fight for it. </p>

<p align="left"> Just now, necessity dictates that the climate regime be 

        protected from the Americans. And it's possible, just possible, that the 

        Europeans are ready to give it a try. Not, to be sure, that this is a 

        time for optimism. If the Bush administration forces the issue of developing 

        country participation, all hell is going to break loose. If the Europeans 

        and the Japanese want to save Kyoto, they're going to have to move fast, 

        and just now the Japanese don't seem ready for decisive action of any 

        sort. The South, for its part, will go along with anything reasonable, 

        anything that gets the first phase of the treaty in place and sets the 

        stage, finally, for the big event--the North/South deal that will finally 

        determine if we can get the global climate onto a &quot;soft landing corridor.&quot; 

        Or if we should just give it up.</p>

<p align="left"> I could be wrong, but it looks to me like it's going to 

        come down, this time, to the Europeans. And I'm hoping that they're as 

        pissed off as they sound.</p>
