Why is world's lone superpower so afraid of its own children?

<P>

   The U.S. is one of the only two UN member nations (the other one is

Somalia) that have failed to ratify the UN's Convention on the Rights of the

Child. Why would the U.S. oppose a measure that states "the child by reason of

his physical and mental immaturity, needs special safeguards and care,

including appropriate legal protection?"

<P>



Well, one reason is that it argues against the new American vogue of trying

kids as adults. In the last few years, 46 states have changed their laws to

allow juveniles to be tried as adults.

<P>

   Among the convention's other provisions is one that prohibits a sentence of

life imprisonment without parole for anyone under 18. This, too, is a rebuke

of America's new affection for locking up youth for life. The planet's richest

country has shocked the world with its eagerness to dispose of its children.

<P>

   Last month, one particularly lurid example of this attitude was on global

display when a Florida judge sentenced 14-year-old Lionel Tate to life in

prison without parole for killing a young playmate in 1999. He is the youngest

person serving a life sentence in the U.S., although most pundits predict that

Florida Gov. Jeb Bush will lessen the punishment.

<P>

   Two weeks later, a 15-year-old Florida boy, John Silva, was sentenced to

life in prison without parole.

<P>

   The previous poster child for America's kid phobia was Nathaniel Abraham,

who in 1999 was convicted of second-degree murder for a shooting in Pontiac,

Mich., when he was 11. Abraham was the youngest child in the nation to be

tried as an adult for a premeditated killing. He faced life imprisonment but,

unlike Florida where the legislature left the judge little discretion,

Michigan's system provided another alternative. The judge sentenced Abraham to

a juvenile detention facility until the age of 21.

<P>

   All of these cases raise the ire of human-rights advocates. "As America

exhorts other nations to uphold basic human-rights principles, we should begin

with the ABCs of human rights and treat our own young offenders as

children--not as adults," said Curt Goering, an official of Amnesty

International USA. There appears to be no logical rationale for this new view

on youthful offenders. Little has changed since the first juvenile court was

established in 1899 on the principle that since children are not

mature--physically, emotionally and intellectually--they should not bear the

same statutory responsibility as adults. In fact, growing scientific knowledge

on human development has solidly reaffirmed the distinction it makes between

child and adult.

<P>

   What's more, a study recently released by a National Academy of Sciences

panel found that the juvenile-justice system is increasingly destructive,

particularly because of the growing trend to imprison juvenile offenders with

adults. "We find no evidence for a crime wave caused by `superpredator' young

people," said panel co-chair Cathy Spatz Widom. "The evidence suggests that

incarcerating youth, if anything, has a negative effect."

<P>

   The superpredator thesis was spread primarily by John DiIulio, the former

Princeton professor and current head of President Bush's White House Office of

Faith-based and Community Initiatives. In a 1996 book he co-authored, DiIulio

predicted that a rising wave of youthful sociopaths would prey on society

"fearing neither the stigma of arrest, pains of imprisonment nor the pangs of

conscience."

<P>

   The alarmist tone of this call to arms echoed in Congress, where Florida

Republican Rep. Bill McCollum introduced the "Violent Youth Predator Act,"

which called for confining children as young as 13 with adult offenders and

denying federal funds to states that do not, among other things. Although

DiIulio's prediction failed to pan out, it provided politicians with an

opportunity to look tough on crime by punishing our young with adult severity.

There also is a racial dimension to this issue; Silva, Tate and Abraham all

are African-American. A study by the Leadership Council on Civil Rights found

that the criminal-justice system sends black youth who have committed a

violent crime to prison nine times more often that white youth who has

committed a similar crime. Our criminal-justice system is devouring black

children at an accelerating rate and either swallows them whole or

regurgitates them back onto the streets as likely recidivists. There's no

mystery why the U.S. is the world's leading jailer; we have created a criminal

factory that produces its own raw materials. The mystery is why we continue to

tolerate this global disgrace.
