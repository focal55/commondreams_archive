IT IS HARD to recall now the stifled panic prompted by the turning of the calendar on Jan. 1, 2000.  The pinnacle of worry was that the so-called Y2K problem would cause malfunctions of nuclear warning systems or even an inadvertent launch of missiles. To guard against such prospects, the United States and Russia established a joint monitoring center near the US missile control center at Cheyenne Mountain in Colorado.

<P>



<p>For most of a month American and Russian officers maintained a common vigil to guard against mistakes.  Nothing happened. Now the world has forgotten how afraid it was - and how collaborative was the response of former enemies. But six months later, in June 2000, President Clinton and the new Russian leader, Vladimir V. Putin, agreed to the establishment of a Joint Data Exchange Center that would make the Y2K missile surveillance cooperation permanent, American and Russian officers working together.

<P>







<p>The center, it was agreed, would be in Moscow. Article 8 of the pact declared that ''the parties intend that the JDEC shall commence operations 365 days after this memorandum enters into force.'' That would have been now. But the building selected for the Moscow center sits empty. There have been squabbles over costs, but the main cause of the collapse of the joint data initiative has been the Bush administration's dogged pursuit of the new missile defense system, paired with its declared readiness to abandon the ABM Treaty.

<P>







<p>Instead of toward cooperation, US-Russian relations have reversed course. Russia reacts to President Bush's plans as if they amount to a decision to replace nuclear parity with overwhelming American superiority, even to the capacity to launch a preemptive strike. That is why Putin last month declared Russian readiness to disregard not only the ABM Treaty but subsequent treaties as well, returning, for example, to the arming of missiles with multiple warheads. ''The nuclear potential of Russia,'' he declared, ''will be augmented multifold. Multifold.''

<P>







<p>What makes a return to heightened levels of nuclear suspicion even more dangerous than in the Cold War is the fact that Russian missile surveillance capabilities have deteriorated, making Moscow partially ''blind'' to threats, which makes Russian missiles even more likely to be launched by mistake. It was this problem of Russian vulnerability, above all, that the Joint Data Exchange Center was intended to help with. And in the context of a crumbling strategic relationship, the positive assumptions that led to the agreement in the first place must be revisited - and rescued.

<P>







<p>That is the significance of a new study about to be published by the Committee on International Security Studies of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, ''The Significance of Joint Missile Surveillance,'' by committee co-chair John Steinbruner (I am a member of this committee,  but I had no part in the study.)

<P>







<p>Before imagining what the future might hold, Steinbruner usefully recalls that the past success of the strategic doctrine of deterrence is based, despite the horrendous mutual threat, on a profound act of cooperation.

<P>







<p>With so much in the balance, each side owes to the other ''credible reassurance that no error of judgment would ever be made. Both countries for their own safety must be absolutely certain that the forces of the other side are not susceptible to false alarm.''  That is the basic rationale behind JDEC, and Steinbruner shows that it is more cogent than ever.

<P>







<p>Steinbruner is a realist, but he is also a visionary. In his analysis, as I read it, a revivified and even expanded Joint Data Exchange Center can do more than address the problem of Russian vulnerability. By expanding cooperative mutual surveillance of all missiles, with each side's launch data and warning systems transparent to the other, each nation would effectively surrender the capacity to launch a sneak attack against the other. Fear of such preemptive attack is the ground not only of the modern nightmare, but of the martial defensiveness built into the human psyche. The mutual renunciation of preemption in an utterly verifiable way would change everything.

<P>







<p>The movement away from suspicion and toward reassurance, in other words, can do far more than reduce the risk of accidental nuclear exchange. It can begin to transform the human relationship of nations that so long defined themselves by being enemies, leading ultimately, in Steinbruner's view, to the dismantling of Cold War structures of mind, as well as of structures of mutual annihilation. 

<P>







<p>Ironically, the American determination to push ahead with missile defense puts these more basic questions on the table. Bush insists that American intentions are benign. With Russia, he has a way to prove it. ''The looming collision over NMD deployment,'' Steinbruner comments, ''promises to create a prominent and relevant opportunity ... (with) the potential both to engage and reshape public consciousness.''

<P>







<p>For starters, the United States should recommit to the Joint Data Exchange Center, a step toward needed technical cooperation, but also toward deeper mutual understanding. Such are the things, in the new millennium, that make for peace.
