Poor Dick Cheney. The vice president is experiencing yet more unpredictable ups and downs - but this time it&#039;s his home energy bill and not his heartbeat that&#039;s erratic.

<P>Cheney, the Bush administration&#039;s point man on energy policy, lives in a 33-room mansion on the grounds of the Naval Observatory in Washington. And the White House wants the Navy - which owns the veep&#039;s house - to pay his entire electric bill this year instead of having Cheney use any of his official budget for the purpose. Right now the Navy and Cheney split the bill.

<P>To be fair to Cheney, this was not his idea. But to be fair to the rest of the country, this is an easy out for the vice president that is not an option for ordinary citizens. And it is especially distasteful to see Cheney solve his energy woes so painlessly after his comments to the rest of the nation.

<P>&#034;If you want to leave all the lights on in your house,&#034; Cheney said, &#034;you can. But you will pay for it.&#034;

<P>We&#039;re all paying for Cheney - no matter what branch of the government his energy bill falls under. But Cheney should have to manage his budget to pay for his own energy costs just like the rest of us. Then maybe he&#039;ll begin to see conservation as a viable energy option.
