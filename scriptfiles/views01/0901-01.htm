IN THE 1880s, when a 40-hour
work week seemed as likely as
space travel, a French social
commentator named Paul
Lafargue described a “strange
delusion” that possessed the
working classes.
<p>“This delusion,” Lafargue wrote in
an incendiary essay called “The Right
to Be Lazy,” “is the love of work, the
furious passion for work, pushed even
to the exhaustion of the vital force of
the individual.”
<p>The Frenchman’s contemporaries were probably less enamored of
work than he believed.
After all, it was during Lafargue’s
time that workers in the West started
building a movement that would eventually lead to a dramatic reduction of
work time as well as an odd new
concept known as the “weekend.”
<p>For about the first two-thirds of the
20th century, declining work time was
the trend in the United States. But
then something happened and, in the
last three decades of the century, work
time started increasing—especially
for the typical family.
<p>Today, the average two-income family with children works the equivalent
of 83 weeks a year, an increase of 15
weeks since 1969. The jump in family
work time over this period, as the
Economic Policy Institute noted in its
“State of Working America 2000–01,”
is the same as adding a quarter-time
worker to the typical household.
<p>Families’ overall work burden grew
most significantly in the 1980s, when
real hourly wages for men and
for some groups of women fell
sharply. Consequently, increases
in annual income for most families during this decade (as well
as the first half of the 1990s)
were the result of more work
rather than higher hourly wages,
according to EPI.
<p>All the work hours we’re piling up have earned us a dubious
honor. The International Labor
Organization has found that U.S.
workers now put in more hours
on the job than their counterparts in any other industrialized nation. In fact, Americans on average now spend
nearly 80 more hours per year at
work than the Japanese, who for
years have been portrayed in our
media as fanatical worker bees.
The ILO, in a 1999 report,
concluded that “the U.S. pattern
of increasing annual hours
worked per person runs contrary
to a world-wide trend in industrialized countries that has seen
hours at work remaining steady
or declining in recent years.”
<p>According to ILO data, the
Japanese saw a 10 percent
decline in annual work hours
between 1980 and 1997, while the
French, who now work the
equivalent of nearly eight fewer
weeks per year than Americans,
experienced a 9 percent decrease
in annual work time during the
same period.
<p>American workers, meanwhile,
were increasingly victimized by
the time bandit, logging  4 percent more total annual work
hours in 1996 than they did in
1980, the ILO found.
<p>Some Americans are feeling
the time crunch more than others. African–American families,
for example, work more hours
than families in other racial or
ethnic groups, according to EPI.
<p>An average middle-income
African–American family with
children needs 489 more annual
work hours (or over 12 more
weeks) than the average white
family to maintain middle-
income status.
<p>Hispanic families also are
working harder to keep up with
the (non-Hispanic white) Joneses,  toiling  228 hours more per
year than whites to enjoy the
middle-class life.
<p>All this work is getting to
many Americans, research
shows. The Families and Work
Institute found in a study earlier
this year that nearly three in 10
Americans reported feeling over-worked often or very often. The
study also revealed that one-quarter of employees do not use
up all of their vacation time
because of the demands of their
jobs—a stunning finding considering that Americans have
the least annual vacation entitlement in the industrialized
world.
<p>It’s hard to discern any good
reason for all the work we’re
doing. U.S. Workers toil longer
than their overseas counterparts
despite being the most productive workers in the world,
according to the ILO. In terms of
value added per hour worked,
U.S. Workers beat Japanese workers—our closest competitors in
the productivity race—by nearly
$9. And, on average, a U.S. worker creates $10,000 more in added
value annually than a Japanese
worker.
<p>As the productivity comparisons show, we’re not working
more because we’re a bunch of
slugs incapable of competing in
the global marketplace.
<p>So what gives? Our  predecessors, who consistently fought
for better wages and less work,
would be appalled  to see how our
productivity has soared in recent
years, but our wages haven’t
kept pace and our time at work
has increased.
<p>Maybe we should learn from
earlier generations and do what
they did: organize to win better
pay and less work. Higher wages
and more time off will become
possibilities only if we demand
them.
<p>For those of us who are comfortably middle class or even
better off, we might also consider changing our consumption
patterns so that we won’t have to
work as much.
<p>“We can ask ourselves whether
we need all the stuff that crowds
our lives and our homes,” says
Robert Reich, a former secretary
of labor in the Clinton administration. “Maybe we can simplify, go with less, and settle for
less income.”
<p>Still, Reich believes worker-friendly public policies are needed to nudge us away from our
work–work–work mentality.
These policies, he said, would
include “paid family leave, wage
insurance to guard against sudden loss of earnings, health insurance and pensions that are
unbundled from our work,
and a minimum of four weeks
vacation.”
<p>As we prepare to take a day off
tomorrow to honor the workers
of this country, we would do well
to set aside a little time to reflect
on work’s proper place in our
lives, bearing in mind that, historically, workers have struggled
to gain extra income and free
time so that they might be more
than just workers.
<p>And, while we’re pondering all
this, we might also take a
moment or two to entertain the
notion that people have a right,
at least every once in a while, to
be lazy.
