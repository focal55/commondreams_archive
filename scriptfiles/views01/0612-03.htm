From climate change to widening gaps between the super-rich and everyone else, humankind's problems seem to be accelerating. Do we have the tools to address them? Can media, such as television and print, help?

<P>Let me tell two stories, one of a little girl in northern India, the second about scientists at the Vostok research station near the South Pole.</P>

<P>In 1995 I visited Bihar, one of India's most wretched states. I went to study the links among population growth, cropland scarcity, and a vicious insurgency in the countryside. Bihar is wracked by crime, corruption, violence and disease; its tired croplands must support some of India's highest-density farming populations and the infrastructure of its cities is collapsing. One day I was walking down an impossibly crowded, garbage-strewn street in Patna, Bihar's capital, and saw a child. I knelt, photographed her and walked on.</P>

<P>Back in Canada, I began working on my book, <I>The Ingenuity Gap</I>, which looks at whether modern human societies can cope with today's complex and dynamic challenges across the spectrum of politics, economics, technology, and ecological affairs. As I sat at my desk, I looked at the the photo. The face of the child, not yet two, already betrayed an immense weariness and distance. But her eyes seemed to watch me.</P>

<P>In June, 1998, I went back to Patna, at the height of the worst heat wave India has ever experienced, with the photo in my hand, looking for this little girl. It was a quixotic thing to do. But people's faces, I was realizing, are critical connection points in our atomized world. As we come to know them, faces help us translate crowds into community, selfishness into empathy.</P>

<P>I found her. Her name, I learned, was Komal Kumari. According to standard quality of life indicators, she's lucky. Fifty years ago, a female baby in India could expect to live to her early 40s; today, Komal Kumari may see her mid-60s. She has an adequate diet, and the hope of getting basic schooling.</P>

<P>The lives of such children are slowly improving. But at the same time, children in rich countries are shooting into the future at blinding speed. Two centuries ago, more than 90 per cent of humankind lived in farming communities, and the cadence of their lives was fundamentally similar. Today, we have impoverished families in Indian slums -- and the virtual realities of Web-ware designers in Silicon Valley.</P>

<P>Just when communication technologies are binding us together, history's biggest differences in wealth, opportunity, and human experience are emerging. Half the people on the planet have never made a phone call. In India, an estimated 60 per cent of all newborns are in such poor condition that, if they had been born in California, they would have immediately been placed in intensive care. And the gulf is widening. In 1960, the income of the richest 20 per cent of the world's population was 30 times that of the poorest 20 per cent; in 1998, it was 82 times greater.</P>

<P>While working on my book, I also looked at the international team of atmospheric scientists and geophysicists at the Vostok research station in Antarctica. From the 1970s into the 1990s, they drilled down into one of the ice sheets that cover much of the southern continent and extracted a four-kilometre-long cylinder or &#34;core&#34; of ice -- a record of Antarctic snowfalls going back 420,000 years. Through painstaking analysis of the ancient snowfalls and air bubbles in the ice cores, the scientists determined both the atmosphere's CO<Sub>2</Sub> concentration and the average temperature over Antarctica.</P>

<P>What they found shocked them.</P>

<P>During the 420,000 years, CO<Sub>2</Sub> concentrations and air temperature varied almost in lock step: As the carbon dioxide concentration rose, the temperature rose; as the CO<Sub>2</Sub> concentration fell, the temperature fell. This close correlation didn't necessarily mean causation, but it provided prima facie evidence of the link between CO<Sub>2</Sub> concentrations and temperature.</P>

<P>What was most shocking was how humankind had already shoved the CO<Sub>2</Sub> concentration far outside the range of fluctuation that had prevailed for hundreds of thousands of years. It is now a third higher than the concentration in preindustrial times.</P>

<P>Experts can't say for sure what the effect will be. But the Vostok ice cores suggest temperature will rise, and fast. Computer models predict that the warming of the next 100 years will probably happen faster than any warming of the last 10,000. Once we get beyond a doubling of CO<Sub>2</Sub> -- which will happen in our grandchildren's lifetimes -- scientists' climate models break down; they don't have a clue what will happen. One thing is certain: With each incremental ton of carbon we are producing an atmosphere very different from the one that influenced human civilizations.</P>

<P>Meanwhile, around the planet, we are moving so much rock, diverting so many rivers, converting so many forests to agriculture, and releasing such quantities of heavy metals and organic chemicals into air and water, that we are perturbing our environment's deepest dynamics. It's as if we've got our collective foot slammed down on the world's accelerator pedal, creating problems whose magnitude and complexity are almost beyond comprehension.</P>

<P>What do the stories of Patna and Vostok tell us? They tell us that at a moment when we're facing the biggest challenges in our history, challenges that will demand all our ingenuity and goodwill, we're more fragmented and incoherent in our personal experiences and our perceptions than ever before.</P>

<P>I'm convinced that without a sense of community, we face a monumental ingenuity gap, a gap between the increasing difficulty of our problems and our ability to cope. We won't be prepared to make the sacrifices or share the costs. As the gulfs of wealth, power, opportunity, and experience widen among us, we need imagination, metaphor, and empathy to help us remember each other's essential humanity. In this, producers of media content are critical actors.</P>

<P>Already, communication technologies make it possible for an electronic message to reach even Komal Kumari's city in India. Many poor families put buying a TV ahead of basic sanitary facilities. People can generate more information faster and deliver it through many more conduits. The problem, the critical bottleneck, is cognitive; we can't shove information into our brains and process it fast enough to keep up with the speed of delivery.</P>

<P>Info-glut affects our interpersonal relationships. They become abbreviated, fragmented. We become ruder. It's now possible for people from every corner of the planet to contact us, so we simply stop responding.</P>

<P>In this fight for space in our brains, ideas must be crude and unreflective to win. At the very moment that our challenges are soaring in complexity and difficulty, info-glut drives us to simplify and sensationalize problems into raging two-sided debates.</P>

<P>Perhaps one solution comes from recent brain research. Conventional wisdom says that human intelligence is manifested in our capacity for logic and analysis, and regards our emotions, such as fear, love, wonder and awe, as &#34;primitive.&#34; New research shows that what makes us the extraordinarily creative, intelligent, and flexible creatures we are is our capacity to integrate reason with emotion. Emotion, it turns out, allows us to see ourselves as connected to past and future. Without it, we are animals responding to immediate pressures. With it, we can plan.</P>

<P>Media, such as television, excel at communicating emotions. That's their strength. And we <I>should </I>be emotionally staggered by our capacity to wreck Earth's environment; we <I>should </I>be appalled by humankind's widening gulfs of experience and opportunity. If television can help convey these feelings around the world, and deep into the psyches of the harried, information-overwhelmed citizens of rich countries, it could be a turning point.
