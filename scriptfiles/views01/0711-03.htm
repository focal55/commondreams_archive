Good to see that sanity can sometimes be as infectious as insanity. All it takes, apparently, is one lucid moment on the part of one public figure, and a whole realm of illusion can be dissipated. The Peter Lilley moment on soft drugs, closely followed by the David Blunkett one, gives some reason to hope that the American nightmare is not in our future.

<P>Here is what happened in my hometown of Washington DC during the Congressional elections of 1998. A local initiative was attached to the ballot, proposing the "decriminalization" of marijuana for medical purposes. After the votes had been counted, it was abruptly announced that the result would not be disclosed. The United States Congress, which has ultimate jurisdiction over municipal government in the capital of the free world, ruled that, though it could not prevent a vote being  taken, it could prevent the outcome from being made public.  

<P>Right away, I knew what I had already guessed - that the citizens had voted overwhelmingly to allow the use of cannabis for the treatment of cancer and glaucoma. But it took a protracted lawsuit to get the ballots counted and the voters decision made known, only to be   negated by Congress once again.  <P>In every other state where this simple question has been mooted at election times, it has carried the day by unanswerable majorities. In each instance, Congress or the federal government has intervened to have the decision set aside. The word for this, in commonplace vernacular, is "denial".  <P>The domestic war against the enemy within, which was begun as Richard Nixon's last desperate gamble for panicky popularity, is now in the same shape as the rest of his legacy. It reeks of corruption, police brutality and overweening bureaucracy. It also involves a demented overseas entanglement, with off-the-record US military aircraft running shady missions over Colombia and Peru, and high-level collaboration with ruthless and unaccountable "Special Forces".  <P>I simply cannot remember the last time, in public or private, that I spoke with a single person who believes this makes the least particle of sense. The opinion pages can occasionally drum up a lone, dull voice, but it's almost invariably that of a paid spokesman for a "war" machine that enjoys funding in inverse proportion to its victories. Again, I know very few habitual drug users, but I also don't know anyone who would be more than two degrees of separation from a   reliable supplier, whether that turned out to be a gangsta or a cop.  

<P>A striking fact is the predominance of honest and intelligent conservatives on the sane side of the argument. The first editor with any "profile" to call for legalization was William F Buckley, the old lion of the rightwing National Review. He has been joined by George   Schultz, formerly Reagan's secretary of state, and by Gary Johnson, the Republican governor of New Mexico, among many others. The "libertarian" journals have been ahead of the "liberal" ones for the most part. In an eerie way, this matches the recent shift of opinion on capital punishment, where conservatives have again been taking the most moral and political risks. (In both cases, the common factor may be Bill Clinton, the Nixon of the liberals, who expanded the drug war just as he increased the scope of the death penalty.)  

<P>Three decades of this grotesque, state-sponsored racketeering have led to unbelievable levels of official corruption and to an unheard-of assault on civil and political liberties. Colombia doesn't look any more like the US as a result, but the US does look a lot more like Colombia. The actual resources expended would have more than paid for national health care: the potential revenue from legal, and therefore clean, narcotics would rebuild the cities from the ground up.
