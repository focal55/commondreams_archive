Longtime fugitive from justice Marc Rich has become the most notorious

recipient of a presidential pardon since Richard Nixon. President Clinton

issued a pardon for the commodities trader in the final hours of his tenure

in office.



<p>What is now widely known about Rich has cast a dark cloud over what

Clinton hoped would be a glorious exit from the presidency. Charged with

income tax fraud and conspiracy, Rich fled to Switzerland, from which he

could not be extradited. Living in the lap of luxury, he continued his

wheeling and dealing in international commodities markets, including

through trades with apartheid South Africa. He invested heavily in seeking

a pardon, courting the Israeli government (dethroned Israel President Ehud

Barak personally lobbied Clinton for Rich's pardon), hiring top-ranking

officials from Democratic and Republican administrations to represent him,

and relying on his ex-wife to lavish money on Democrats during the Clinton

years.



<p>What is not widely known, at least outside of West Virginia and certain

labor circles, is that Rich played a central role in one of the highest

profile union-busting efforts the United States has seen in recent decades.



<p>In the early 1990s, Marc Rich was the power-behind-the-scenes at the

Ravenswood Aluminum Corporation (RAC) facility in Ravenswood, West Virginia,

site of one of the most embittered U.S. labor-management disputes of recent

decades.



<p>The Ravenswood conflict has been chronicled by Tom Juravich and Kate

Bronfenbrenner in their inspiring account, Ravenswood: The Steelworkers'

Victory and the Revival of American Labor (Ithaca, New York: ILR/Cornell

University Press, 1999).



<p>In 1990, in a premeditated effort to break the union, RAC locked out its

1,700 workers, members of the United Steelworkers of America, and hired

permanent replacements.



<p>As the contract deadline neared, RAC installed surveillance cameras, new

security systems and a chainlink fence around the perimeter of the facility.

The night of the lockout, the company brought in a goon squad security force

equipped with riot gear, clubs, tear gas and video cameras used to

constantly monitor the workers' pickets. The goons introduced a climate of

fear and made violence on the picket lines, and in the town, an ever-present

fear.



<p>Caught unprepared, the Steelworkers' local was able to keep all but a

handful of workers from crossing the picket line and union solidarity was

strong and militant, but RAC was ready to wait the workers out.



<p>As the lockout progressed, the Steelworkers' international union became

engaged, and eventually launched a corporate campaign to complement the

local's efforts. That corporate campaign took them to Marc Rich.



<p>The Ravenswood plant, which had been owned by Kaiser Aluminum for four

decades, passed into the ownership of RAC in 1988. The union discovered

that, behind a convoluted corporate ownership smokescreen, stood one man

with a controlling interest in RAC: Marc Rich.



<p>It is unlikely that Rich initially knew what RAC was up to when the

lockout began -- RAC was just a piece in his global corporate puzzle. But

about four months into the conflict, the union had made the Rich

connection and was calling on him to end the lockout.



<p>"From that point on, Rich was culpable for what went on and the suffering

the Ravenswood workers went through," says Bronfenbrenner.



<p>For 20 long months, the workers lived on minimal strike benefits, six months

worth of unemployment benefits and donated food and supplies. Being out of

work for so long, even from a lockout where union solidarity remains high,

takes an emotional toll to match the financial one. It is no exaggeration

when Bronfenbrenner speaks of the suffering of the workers and their

families.



<p>As the Steelworkers tracked Rich to Switzerland and began applying pressure

on his business operations in Europe, the corporate campaign moved to a new

plane and the union discovered how extensive was Rich's reach.



<p>Soon they found themselves negotiating with Leonard Garment, White House

Counsel under Richard Nixon, and William Bradford Reynolds, the number two

at the Reagan Justice Department. Both Garment and Reynolds worked for Rich

-- who would later show that he was right to trust in high-priced,

politically connected legal help when Jack Quinn, former Clinton White House

Counsel, would do the crucial work to win Rich his pardon.



<p>As the Steelworkers' campaign got closer to Rich's significant financial

interests, union representatives received numerous death threats.



<p>When left-leaning Michael Manley was elected president of Jamaica in 1989,

the Steelworkers were hopeful he would follow through on promises to cut his

predecessor's close ties to Rich -- ties which gave Rich access to Jamaica's

alumina at less than half the market rate. But when Manley faced immediate

pressure from the International Monetary Fund to raise foreign capital, Rich

gave the government a $50 million cash advance. Manley then backed down from

efforts to end the Rich connection.



<p>But the Steelworkers' comprehensive international campaign did achieve major

successes, including blocking Rich's purchase of the Slovakian National

Aluminum Company and a majority stake in a luxury Romanian hotel, convincing

Budweiser and Stroh's not to buy RAC aluminum, and heaping unwanted

publicity on Rich. Meanwhile, local solidarity remained strong.



<p>This all cost Rich. In April 1992, Rich finally moved to replace

management at RAC and end the lockout. The final contract terms were not

entirely favorable to the workers, but they had at least succeeded in

defeating the company's vicious attempt to bust the union.



<p>Asked about Clinton's pardon of Rich, Dan Stidham, who was president of the

Ravenswood local during the strike and is now retired, says it is "really

disappointing."



<p>Stidham modestly says that he's "pretty upset that Clinton would pardon that

guy after all we went through for 20 months."



<p>In granting the pardon, Clinton probably did not know of Rich's odious role

in the Ravenswood lockout. Perhaps, as he claims, he did not know of Rich's

ex-wife's support for the Democrats.



<p>But neither of those facts, if they are facts, makes the pardon smell any

better.



<p>If Clinton didn't know, he should have. And if he didn't know, it only

highlights how in an increasingly corrupt political system, money not only

can gain you access to the highest levels of influence and but can

enable corporate lawbreakers to launder their image and reputations.



<p>Ironically, even though Rich has won the right to return to the United

States without facing trial, the attention surrounding the pardon has

permanently stained his reputation.



<p>That may be some small solace to the workers at Ravenswood, who will

forever know Rich as a criminal in more ways than one.
