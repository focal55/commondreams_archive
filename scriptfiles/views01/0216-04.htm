The Palestinian bus driver who rammed into a crowd of Israeli

soldiers and commuters, killing eight of them, may have been responding

to previous violence in which Palestinians were killed and wounded by

Israeli troops. But that is no excuse. Violence against Israelis is not

an appropriate response to the horrible repression, destruction of homes

and livelihoods and shootings of Palestinians being inflicted

systematically and daily by the Israeli army.

<p>Most news accounts simply underplay the high rate of Palestinian

deaths and casualties from the Israeli occupying force. So when a tragic

event like this occurs, many Israelis have no context for it. They don't

know about the numbers of people killed by Israeli forces. But no matter

how terrible the occupation and how racist the responses of Israelis and

of many in the West who seem oblivious to Palestinian suffering imposed

by the Israeli occupation, violence is never an appropriate response.

<p>The most successful struggles waged against oppression of this sort

have been those that have had a principled commitment to nonviolence. The

Palestinian people should learn from and follow the example of Martin

Luther King Jr., Mohandas K. Gandhi and Nelson Mandela. In the final

analysis, all those struggles were won because the nonviolence of the

oppressed touched something deep in the hearts of the oppressors,

dividing the community of those who were militarily more powerful and

creating a sense of moral obligation to listen to the needs of the less

powerful.

<p>Violence, on the other hand, unites the occupier's community and gives

justification for using violence against the oppressed. It's no use to

say, "Well, they were doing that anyway." If the goal is to undermine the

ability of the superior military force to continue to act immorally, the

occupied need to claim the higher moral ground, and that can be done only

with nonviolence.

<p>Of course, it's not hard to see why Palestinians would see the

election of Ariel Sharon as a statement by the majority of Israelis that

they were endorsing more repression against Palestinians. Just like

Yasser Arafat, Sharon has blood on his hands. But Palestinians are making

a big mistake to write off the many Israelis who want peace.

<p>And there is another reason to reject violence: because it's morally

wrong. The Palestinians who engage in violence are not only doing

something that is self-destructive and stupid, but they also are doing

something that is a moral outrage. Every human being is equally precious

to God. Communicating that human life is sacred is the first step toward

persuading your antagonist that real reconciliation is possible. For the

same reasons, I condemn Israeli violence, which is an inevitable part of

the occupation, and call for Israel to withdraw its troops and its

settlers to the pre-1967 borders of Israel. Let the Palestinians have

their own national self-determination, just as Jews have our

self-determination in Israel.

<p>Instead, Israel has set the worst possible example. It has used state

terrorism against civilians. It has deployed its forces to kill

individual Palestinians it considers dangerous. It has taken massive

reprisals against the entire Palestinian population for the actions of a

few. It has killed children who were throwing rocks. It has allowed its

settlers to roam through Palestinian villages in quasi-pogrom fashion,

doing violence and destruction.

<p>When will this madness end? If history is any indication, the

occupation is a lost cause. Eventually, the Israelis will be forced to

give up occupying another people. But that won't happen until the

Palestinians have mobilized world opinion on their behalf, and that they

cannot do while engaged in acts of violence.

<p>Perhaps the most terrible thing that Israel ever did was to bring

Arafat and his band of armed thugs back from Tunisia and impose them on

the West Bank and Gaza. Arafat's history of violence against Israelis is

matched by violence against his own people. In arming him and giving him

the ability to be the representative of the Palestinians, the Israelis

cynically assured that they never would have to face the one thing that

could defeat them: a morally based, nonviolent population willing to

engage in massive nonviolent civil disobedience over a sustained period

of time.

<p>We can only hope that a new leadership will develop in Palestine with

a new moral vision. But it's a hard time to sell nonviolence in principle

to those who remember the way that forces under Sharon massacred hundreds

of civilians. This is going to be a difficult period. The message that

supporters of Israel in the United States must convey to Israel is this:

Your security is best achieved by reconciliation with the Palestinian

people. And we who love Judaism cannot convince our children that its

true message is about love, social justice, generosity, openheartedness

and connection to deep spiritual truths if we continually are forced to

defend as the embodiment of Jewishness a state that is becoming a

worldwide symbol of insensitivity, anger and mean-spirited denial of the

rights of others.
