Ward Connerly supports white privilege by speaking the language of a 

colorblind society.  His proposed ballot measure — the Racial Privacy 

Initiative — would prohibit many California agencies from seeking racial data. 

<p>Connerly, who has to get about 1 million signatures by mid-August to 

qualify the Racial Privacy Initiative for the March 2002 ballot, thus seeks 

to turn the reality of skin color on its head.



<p>Meanwhile, white privilege is many things.  One is not thinking about the 

meaning of being white.  Pointing this out is unacceptable in the 

mainstream.  Connerly is thus able to avoid the subject of white privilege, 

which makes it more powerful.



<p>W.E.B. Du Bois said that white privilege pays a “public and psychological 

wage” in America.  Much of his point about white skin color rings true 

today.



<p>Publicly, being white includes avoiding police stops based on skin color.  

Nonwhite Americans live differently.  Just listen to them.



<p>A little over a year ago, I went to one of a series of town hall meetings on 

racial profiling being held throughout California, sponsored by the Racial 

Justice Coalition. Dozens of black and brown men and women testified clearly 

and forcefully how their skin color has spurred harmful stops and arrests by 

law-enforcement officers. One young woman of color who attends CSU, 

Sacramento said that a police officer in an unmarked car fol-lowed her for 

miles at night, and then finally showed identification after stopping and 

requesting her driver's license. The police were attempting to “clear some 

garbage from the streets,” he told her.  “I may have been many things in my 

life,” the young woman said, “but being a piece of garbage isn’t one of 

them.”



<p>In the meantime, the voices of the racially profiled have been downplayed by 

Connerly, a Republican, and California Governor Gray Davis, a Democrat.  In 

fact, the governor has opposed legislation for all of the state’s 

law-enforcement agencies to collect data on the racial profiles of people 

stopped and arrested.



<p>White privilege also means improved job opportunities.  Nationwide, the May 

jobless rate was 4.4 percent—whites, 3.8 percent, blacks, 8.0 percent and 

Latinos, 6.2 percent, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.



<p>Consider white privilege and the reforming of welfare recipients into hourly 

workers.  “Compared to their white counterparts, black recipients were more 

likely to be required to take a pre-employment test, less likely to obtain 

employment regardless of educational background and less likely to report 

receiving job or educational information from caseworkers,” the American 

Friends Service Committee recently reported.



<p>Equality of job opportunity is a myth.  White privilege matters when it 

comes to finding work.



<p>Recall that Connerly, a Sacramento businessman and University of California 

Regent, backed the state’s Proposition 209, which voters passed in 1996. 

Proposition 209 was a ballot measure that stopped state government 

preferences based on race and gender.  Supposedly, this was the way to 

return California to a level playing field where citizens competed equally 

and the most qualified were rewarded.



<p>Biologically, of course, there is a single race.  We are all part of the 

human race.



<p>Yet racial ideology is a different thing.  Consider changing definitions of 

who is white and nonwhite.



<p>Before World War I, America’s WASP elite viewed my Jewish immigrant 

ancestors from Europe as racially inferior.  Later, they and many like them 

“whitened,” as Karen Brodkin Sacks demonstrated in “How Did Jews Become 

White Folks?”



<p>Irish immigrants to America, once thought to be a separate race, also become 

white.  Noel Ignatiev’s book analyzes this subject in stark detail.



<p>My point?  Race doesn’t always have to be a skin color issue.  America just 

seems that way in 2001.



<p>Psychologically, white-skin privilege is very complex.  In America, the 

enslaving of Africans and conquering of Natives created and sustained the 

idea of nonwhite people who deserve their oppression. Thus arose a 

definition of whiteness based on theft of labor and land from the 

darker-skinned “Other.”



<p>With the American ethnic cleansing came the ideology of white privilege.  

Later as industrial capitalism began, white workers’ additional loss of 

humanity opened a new chapter of white privilege, David Roediger wrote.



<p>On one hand, job insecurity is partly the story behind the political use of 

white privilege in California.  The military base closures and corporate 

downsizings and restructurings that cut stable, well-paying jobs during the 

1990s paved the way for attacks on immigrants and affirmative action in the 

state.



<p>On the other hand, appeals to economic class that sidestep white privilege 

and all that it conceals and reveals are limited.  Ralph Nader’s two 

presidential campaigns (that I supported) are cases in point.



<p>White privilege is a misfortune and a part of economic class relations.  Not 

one or the other but both.



<p>White Californians can’t be free if their nonwhite counterparts are unfree.  

Ending white privilege is a step towards true equality.  Let that be a 

response to Connerly.
