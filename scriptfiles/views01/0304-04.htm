<P align="right">-- 11th century Benedictine St. Romuald

<P>THEY RESIDE two miles above state Highway 1 and the Big Sur coast on 899 

acres of land covered with redwood, oak, madrone and laurel: 30 monks and 

hermits of the New Camaldoli branch of the Roman Catholic order of 

Benedictines.

<P>Contemplatives in every sense of the word, they pray, meditate, sing and 

eat their vegetarian meals in silence. As part of their 1,000-year-old mission,

<P>the monks work hard, physically and spiritually, to maintain a profoundly 

peaceful retreat for hundreds of weary souls who come to their door each year, 

battered by the outside world and needing healing.

<P>But if the U.S. Navy has its way, the monks and their holy retreat will 

become the backyard of ground zero for some 2,800 annual practice bombing runs 

by F/A-18 fighter jets.

<P>"The Navy says the monks won't be able to hear the noise from the jets, but 

they will," said Rep. Sam Farr, D-Carmel. "Up there at the monastery, you can 

hear sea lions from two miles away in the Pacific."

<P>The Camaldolese community was founded in 1027 by an Italian monk and 

eventual saint, Romuald. The hermitage in Big Sur (actually perched above the 

mini-hamlet of Lucia) was opened in 1958.

<P>Besides their retreat rooms and trailers, which rent for a modest fee per 

night with meals, the monks support their work with a bookstore and by baking 

and selling fabulous brandy-dipped fruitcakes and date-nut cakes.

<P>For three months in 1999, when wildfires destroyed almost 100,000 acres of 

the surrounding Los Padres National Forest, they scrambled side-by-side with 

professional firefighters to keep their beautiful, spare chapel and fragrant 

hillsides from joining the casualty list.

<P>Now, "to save resources and money," the Navy wants to expand its aerial 

bombardment training program in the area. Instead of aiming at target ranges 

in Nevada, Arizona and elsewhere in California, pilots would concentrate on 

what is now a minimally used segment of Hunter Liggett, a deactivated Army 

base just east of Lucia.

<P>That means 12 practice sorties, five days a week, for 47 weeks in the 

valley behind the monastery. This translates daily into 12 Hornet fighter jets 

taking a dozen shots each at a red-and-white, 500-foot bull's-eye target.

<P>Most of the jets would take off from Lemoore Naval Air Station, 67 air 

miles from the proposed practice area. Others would fly in off the Pacific, 

directly over the hermitage, from aircraft carriers. All would descend to 

about 1,500 feet to drop their 10-to-25-pound, non-explosive fake bombs.

<P>Lest one think the reclusive Camaldolese monks are the only Big Sur 

residents who will be affected by the Navy's jet-fueled noise, one should log 

onto pelicannetwork.net. Hundreds of angry folks -- from environmentalists to 

vintners -- are using the site to gather information about the proposal and to 

protest.

<P>Along with losing peaceful hikes, the locals see a host of endangered plant 

and animal species in the Navy's crosshairs. Not the least of these are more 

than a dozen California condors, brought back from the edge of extinction and 

living in the Ventana Wilderness.

<P>Historians who are trying to restore the language and culture of the 10,000-

year-old Salinan Nation worry about painted caves and a sacred sandstone arch 

that were created by the Native American tribe. Among other things, the 

Salinans believed the world began in the dramatic Santa Lucia Mountains of Big 

Sur.

<P>If ever there were a time for California's two U.S. senators to speak up 

about the Navy's planned invasion, it is now -- especially Dianne Feinstein, 

who sits on the Senate Appropriations Committee and a host of its 

subcommittees, including military construction, defense and interior.

<P>Farr has been almost a lone voice in Congress on the issue. He could use 

some help.

<P>"This really deserves national attention," he said. "Where else do you bomb 

condors and monks?"
