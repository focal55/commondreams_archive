A new policy toward Iraq announced a few days before the close of the Clinton administration has placed the United States in a deliberately provocative role - as open sponsor of anti-Saddam Hussein opposition inside Iraq. It is another escalation in the endless war against the Iraqi regime and oddly ill-timed. Congress required Clinton to support the insurgents in Iraq, but it will be up to President-elect Bush to administer the policy.

<p>

Intensifying the Iraqi policy now is a bad idea. If anything should come from the handoff from Clinton to Bush concerning Iraq, it should be a pause in current policy rather than starting a new and more militant one.

<p>

Sunday, Iraq's oil minister once again rejected the return of U.N. weapons inspectors to Iraq as a condition for the end of sanctions. A 1999 U.N. resolution promises the end of economic sanctions against Iraq if weapons inspectors are allowed to resume the search for evidence of Iraqi biological and nuclear weapons programs. Oil Minister Amir Muhammed Rasheed dismissed the idea again, calling the policy a complete failure. No weapons inspectors - ever, Rasheed said.

<p>

Concurrently, the Clinton administration announced plans to distrib-ute $12 million in humanitarian aid inside Iraq through the Iraqi National Congress, the main opposition force in northern Iraq. The re-establishment of the INC's aid and propaganda effort inside Iraq by the U.S. will obviously be seen by Saddam as another attempt to stir a revolt against him.

<p>

A better plan would be to let the current Clinton policy lapse and for the new administration to take a fresh look at U.S. policies. 

<p>

Tomorrow marks the 10th anniversary of the beginning of the Gulf War. In the past decade, Saddam Hussein has remained ruthlessly in power, U.S. and British warplanes endlessly patrol north and south "no fly zones," and economic sanctions against Iraq's civilian population remain a crippling burden on the war's innocent victims.

<p>

Time to try something new. An end to economic sanctions would signal to Saddam and the world that America is prepared for a new beginning in the Gulf region. Instead of directly funding the INC and putting America openly into the business of overthrowing the regime, humanitarian aid could go into Iraq through third parties such as the U.N. or numerous international aid organizations.

<p>

The United States does not have to make peace with Saddam Hussein or embrace the tyrant. An end to sanctions is only a step, but the first, important one. It sends a signal not only to Iraq but to people everywhere looking for the conclusion to 10 years of belligerence.
