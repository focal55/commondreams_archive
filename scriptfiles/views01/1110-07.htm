U. S. corporations aren't  even subtle about it.  Waving a flag and

carrying a big shovel,  corporate interests are scooping up government

benefits and taxpayer money in an unprecedented fashion while the public

is preoccupied with the September 11 attacks and the war in Afghanistan.



 <p>Shamelessly, the Bush Administration and Congress have taken advantage

of the patriotic outpouring to fulfill the wish lists of their most

generous corporate campaign donors. Not only is  the Treasury being

raided, but regulations protecting everything from personal privacy to

environmental safeguards are under attack by well-heeled lobbyists who

want to stampede Congress to act while the media and citizens are

distracted.</p>



 <p>Only a handful in the Congress--members like Senator Russell Feingold

of Wisconsin and Representatives Peter DeFazio of Oregon and Barbara Lee

of California--have shown the courage to question the giveaways and the

quick wipeout of civil liberties and other citizen protections.  In most

cases, such as the $15 billion airline bailout and corporate tax breaks,

legislation has  been pushed to the forefront with little or no hearings

and only fleeting consideration on the floor of the Senate and the House

of Representatives.</p>



 <p>One of the boldest grabs for cash has been by corporations seeking to

eliminate the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT), which was enacted during

the Reagan Administration to prevent profitable corporations from

escaping all tax liability through various loopholes. Not only do the

corporations want relief from the current year's AMT taxes, but they are

seeking a retroactive refund of all AMT taxes paid since 1986.</p>



 <p>This giveaway, as passed by the House of Representatives, would make

corporations eligible for $25 billion in tax refunds.  Just 14

corporations would receive $6.3 billion of the refund. IBM gets $1.4

billion; General Motors, $833  million; General Electric $671 million;

Daimler-Chrysler $600 million; Chevron-Texaco $572 million. The 14

biggest beneficiaries of  the minimum tax repeal gave $14,769,785 in

"soft money" to the national committees of the Democratic and Republican

parties in recent years.</p>



 <p>Soon to join the bailout parade is the nation's insurance industry,

which is lobbying the Congress to have the federal government pick up

the tab for future losses like those stemming from the attack on the

World Trade Center.  Proposals are on the table for taxpayers to either

pick up losses above certain levels or to provide loans or loan

guarantees for reinsurance.</p>



 <p>The insurance companies want federal bailouts, but they continue to

insist on  regulation only by underfunded, poorly staffed state

insurance departments, most of which are dominated by the industry. Any

bailout or loan program involving the insurance companies must include

provisions which ensure that insurance companies cannot refuse to write

policies and make investments in low, moderate and minority

neighborhoods.  Allegations about insurance company  "redlining" or

discrimination against citizens in these areas have been prevalent for

many years.  It would be a terrible injustice for citizens to be forced

to pay taxes to help bail out insurance companies that discriminate

against them. Congress needs to address this issue before it even

considers public assistance for the industry.</p>



 <p>People-concerns have been missing in all the bailouts.  When the

airline companies walked off with $15 billion plus in bailout money, the

thousands of laid-off employees--airline attendants, maintenance crews,

baggage handlers and ticket counter employees--received not a dime.

Attempts to include health benefits and other help for these employees

were shouted down on the floor of the House of Representatives.</p>



 <p>Last month, more than 400,000 employees lost their jobs nationwide and

the national unemployment rate rose to 5.4 percent, the highest level

since 1996.  The Bureau of  Labor Statistics said roughly a fourth of

the lost jobs were the direct result of the terrorist attacks of

September 11. Bailouts, benefits or other aid for these victims of the

attacks?  No, that's  reserved just for the corporations under the

policies of the Bush Administration and the present Congress.</p>



 <p>Yet it is the workers in the low-wage jobs--like those in restaurants,

hotels, retailing and transportation--who are bearing the brunt of the

layoffs in the aftermath of the attacks on the World Trade Center,

according to a report from the New York State Department of  Labor.

Almost 25,000 people told the department that they lost their jobs

because of the trade center disaster. An analysis by the department of

the first 22,000 of the claims found that 16 percent worked at bars, 14

percent worked at hotels, 5 percent worked in air transportation and 21

percent in a category termed "business services."  Only 4 percent worked

at Wall Street brokerage firms.</p>



 <p>While more workers lose jobs, the Administration is pushing for

authority to expand the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA)

under new "fast-track" authority.  The Department of Commerce concedes

that at least 360,000 jobs have been lost under NAFTA, and private

research groups estimate the total may  be twice that number.  Now, with

unemployment rising to alarming levels, the Administration decides to

cave to pro-NAFTA corporate demands which will only make the labor

picture worse. No bailout for laid off workers, just a hard crack across

the knees.</p>



 <p>As Bill Moyers, the author and national journalist, commented:

"They (the corporations) are counting on your patriotism to distract

you from their plunder. They're counting on you to stand at attention

with your hand over your heart, pledging allegiance to the flag, while

they pick your pocket."</p>



 

<p>The present crisis cries out for shared sacrifice--not the opportunism

so blatantly displayed by the nation's corporate interests.  President

Bush and the Congress must summon the courage to resist the self-serving

demands--the kind of courage and shared sacrifice that guided the brave

rescue workers on September 11.</p>
