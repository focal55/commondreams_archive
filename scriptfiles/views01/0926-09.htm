Make way for the wartime opportunists.



<p>Corporate interests and their proxies are looking to exploit the September

11 tragedy to advance a self-serving agenda that has nothing to do with

national security and everything to do with corporate profits and

dangerous ideologies.



<p>Fast track and the Free Trade Area of the Americas. A corporate tax cut.

Oil drilling in Alaska. Star Wars. These are some of the preposterous

"solutions" and responses to the terror attack offered by corporate

mouthpieces.



<p>No one has been more shameless in linking their agenda to the terror

attack than U.S. Trade Representative Robert Zoellick. Writing in the

Washington Post last week, Zoellick proclaimed that granting fast-track

trade negotiating authority to the president -- to assist with the ramming

through Congress of a Free Trade Area of the Americas, designed to expand

NAFTA to all of the Americas, among other nefarious ends -- was the best

way to respond to the September 11 tragedy.



<p>"Earlier enemies learned that America is the arsenal of democracy,"

Zoellick wrote, "Today's enemies will learn that America is the economic

engine for freedom, opportunity and development. To that end, U.S.

leadership in promoting the international economic and trading system is

vital. Trade is about more than economic efficiency. It promotes the

values at the heart of this protracted struggle."



<p>No explanation from Zoellick about how adopting a procedural rule designed

to limit Congressional debate on controversial trade agreements advances

the democratic and rule-of-law values he says the United States must now

project.



<p>The administration has identified fast track as one of the handful of

legislative priorities it hopes to see Congress enact this year.



<p>Getting fast track passed isn't big business's only priority for the

shrinking legislative calendar. The Fortune 500 has been whimpering since

George Bush was elected president and top administration officials told

the business community to silence their demand for corporate tax cuts

until after passage of the inequality-increasing personal income tax cut.



<p>Even before the September 11 attack, business interests and the anti-tax

ideologues were increasingly making noise that corporate tax cuts were the

solution to the coming recession.



<p>Now they are beginning to argue that capital gains tax cuts and corporate

tax breaks are America's patriotic duty.



<p>In releasing a study purporting to explain how a capital gains cut would

spur economic growth, the National Taxpayers Union (NTU) touted a capital

gains tax cut -- a tax break that exclusively benefits the wealthy -- as

an anti-terrorism initiative. "By reducing the rate at which capital gains

are taxed, President Bush and Congress could help revitalize the sagging

economy and bring new revenues to Washington -- decidedly aiding our war

against terrorism," said NTU director of congressional relations Eric

Schlecht.



<p>Not wishing to be outdone, Senator Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska, didn't wait

long to explain how the terror attack makes it imperative to open up the

Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR). "There is no doubt that at this

time of national emergency, an expedited energy-security bill must be

considered," the Alaska senator announced last week. "Opening ANWR will be

a central element in finally reducing this country's dangerous

overdependence on unstable foreign sources of energy," he said.



<p>Neither Murkowski nor the oil companies pushing for opening ANWR have ever

been able to offer a coherent explanation of how using up U.S. oil

reserves heightens energy security. Security rests in maintaining the

reserves. Real energy security and independence can only come from

renewables (particularly solar and wind) -- where the supply is plentiful

and infinitely renewing. Only a failure of public and private investment

leaves the country (and the world) unable to harvest renewable energy

efficiently.



<p>And, of course, the purveyors of Star Wars couldn't let the opportunity

pass them by. The Center for Security Policy --the center of a web of

defense industry-backed think tanks and organizations pushing for a

National Missile Defense program -- urged President Bush in advance of his

address to Congress to announce that "this Administration will use every

tool at its disposal to ensure that the resources and latitude needed to

develop and deploy missile defenses are made available."



<p>A missile defense system -- even if it overcame the technical obstacles

which have so far proved insurmountable, after billions spent -- would

have done nothing to stop the September 11 attack. Nor would it do

anything to stop any other conceivable terrorist attack on the United

States, none of which involve might missile delivery systems.



<p>Opportunism and cynical manipulation of tragedy are nothing new in

Washington. But the proposals to exploit the September 11 tragedy for

narrow corporate aims mark a new low.



<p>The United States is emerging from a national mourning period. Now is the

time to proceed with caution and care, as the nation seeks to address

legitimate security concerns (e.g., airport security) and tend to victims

of the attack. It is no time to rush through proposals on matters

essentially unrelated to the attack, especially damaging and foolhardy

proposals that have been unable to win popular or Congressional support

when the public has had a chance to consider them dispassionately, and on

the merits.
