Want honesty from one member of the Bush administration about America’s 

federal tax policy?  Then listen to Treasury Secretary Paul O’Neill.



<p>O’Neill can’t be accused of putting people to sleep by talking left and 

moving right as President Clinton did convincingly on a regular basis.  In a 

recent interview with the Financial Times, O’Neill called current U.S. tax 

policy “an abomination,” the “very structure” of which must be changed.



<p>As Bob Dylan sang, “look out kids.”



<p>One change that the Treasury Secretary, a former CEO of Alcoa, supports is 

the elimination of corporate income tax.  This would increase the 

competitiveness of U.S. corporations and spur growth, he said.



<p>Income taxes on corporations comprise approximately 10 percent of all U.S. 

government revenues.



<p>O’Neill’s view of the corporate income tax as a drag on business growth 

neatly sidesteps the factor of excess capacity in the global economy.  It 

features a glut of products, from cars to coffee and computers, that 

consumers can’t afford to buy.



<p>It would be most revealing to hear a journalist ask O’Neill why a 

corporation would invest its tax savings to become more competitive by 

expanding agricultural or industrial production when the global economy has 

a glut of unsold goods.  We might be waiting a spell for a member of 

America’s mainstream news to put this question to him.



<p>The Treasury Secretary also said in the Financial Times interview that he 

wants to eliminate business’ capital gains tax.  This policy proposal 

reflects the rising role of Wall Street finance in business activity.



<p>O’Neill assumes that what’s good for Wall Street holds for Main Street as 

well.  That is certainly the prevailing view, but it can change swiftly 

given the American economy’s increasing reliance on consumers and 

corporations spending more than their earnings, financed by record debt.



<p>The late economist Hyman Minsky coined a term for this trend: financial

fragility.



<p>Which brings us to O’Neill’s view of public responsibility and the funding 

of the American people’s health care and retirement.  To this end, he 

suggests major changes in two popular public programs: Medicare and Social 

Security.



<p>Public responsibility for the infirm and retired should instead be replaced 

with personal responsibility.  Some might call this a version of “tough 

love.”



<p>According to O’Neill, "Able-bodied adults who have the ability to earn 

income have an obligation not to pass part of their own responsibility on to 

a broader population."  This would, in the case of Social Security, 

effectively eliminate a person’s ability to retire as a wage worker.



<p>Here O’Neill’s vision props up the larger claim that Social Security has big 

financial problems.  Economist Dean Baker takes a different view of Social 

Security.



<p>“According to the most recent [Social Security] trustees' report, the 

program can pay all scheduled benefits until the year 2037, with no changes 

whatsoever,” Baker notes.  “Even after this date, the program would always 

be able to pay a larger real (inflation adjusted) benefit than an average 

retiree receives at present.”



<p>In the meantime, Medicare’s ills in the main flow from America’s health care 

crisis.



<p>Thank our corporate Democrats and Republicans for cutting Medicare funds and 

forcing seniors into HMOs that are loath to help the aged and infirm.  To 

say nothing of Medicare’s non-funding of care in a long-term skilled nursing 

facility.



<p>“Seattle” activism to protest, defend, and yes, expand Social Security and 

Medicare could certainly counter O’Neill’s vision of tax policy, expressed 

honestly in the Financial Times interview.  In brief, the Treasury 

Secretary’s deal isn’t yet sealed.



<p>On one hand, the economic class interests represented by O’Neill include the 

Republican House, basically a Republican Senate and corporate America.  They 

understand what’s at stake.



<p>On the other, large numbers of the American people must wake from their 

slumber and do likewise.  Such activism could well herald the dawn of a more 

civilized society.
