AUSTIN -- Look at it this way: The president hasn't barfed on

anyone yet, and he's only mispronounced one world leader's name so

far. The bad news is it was the only guy over there who likes us, and

he has only two syllables in his name.<p>

    I think we can assume George W. will skate through this trip

because he'll turn out to be not as bad as they thought. The soft

bigotry of low expectations works for him every time. But it was

probably a mistake to schedule him for Slovenia-Slovakia -- that's

just asking for trouble.<p>

    In case you were wondering just why the Europeans are so upset

about our death penalty (MYOB, Yuripeens), it's because it's clear to

everyone but us that the main crime that gets you sentenced to death

in this country is being poor. This seriously undercuts our moral

authority to speak on human-rights issues. The unfortunate case of the

Spanish citizen who was sentenced to death here until the folks back

home raised enough money to buy him some decent lawyering does not

help.<p>

    National Missile Defense is a hard sell anywhere because it's one

of those bizarre notions -- like the flat tax and school vouchers --

that the right wing gets hipped on and won't let go. It's a crummy

idea because: A) it doesn't work, and B) it encourages paranoia among

our non-allies, who think it's a reach for protected first-strike

capability. It doesn't help to have President W. informing our allies,

"The Cold War is over," as though they hadn't previously twigged to

the fact. To have noticed that the Cold War is over without picking up

on the news that the globe is getting warmer must seem odd to those

who are not accustomed to President Cognitive Dissonance.<p>

    Bush's last-minute attempt to put together a lame initiative on

global warming was embarrassing. Now he's back to voluntary pollution

control, which we have tried in Texas -- and it does not work worth a

blue-bellied damn.<p>

    To give you an idea of how ineffective voluntary controls are, when

Bush was elected governor, Texas had 850 plants with grandfather

exemptions to the state's clean air act -- they had been

grandfathered 23 years earlier and no one had done anything about

them. These plants produce 36 percent of the state's total air

pollution, and Texas' air is worse than any other state's.<p>

    Even the ineffective Texas environmental protection agency finally

concluded something had to be done about the old plants. But Bush

jumped in and supported a voluntary plan hatched by two dozen of the

biggest polluters in the state (also major Bush contributors). The

plan was put into a bill written by a lobbyist for the Texas Chemical

Council, and Bush pushed it through. The results after two years ----

of the 850 grandfathered polluters, 28 had gone so far as to come up

with a plan to reduce their pollution in the future, and three had

actually done something. This kind of genius scheme is not going to

save us from global warming. Neither is National Missile Defense.<p>

    Those with a realistic grasp of global warming believe the Kyoto

Protocol itself is inadequate, and here's Bush acting as though it is

the worst idea since the Treaty of Munich. He's already broken his

campaign promise to cut carbon dioxide emissions, one of the main

greenhouse gases, because it made the coal and oil industries unhappy.<p>

    Europeans, being understandably interested in self-preservation,

are unlikely to comprehend Bush's solicitous concern for polluters.

Whining, "But India and China don't have to do anything" (under the

Kyoto accords) is beside the point. India and China don't produce that

much pollution. We do -- 5 percent of the world's population and 25

percent of the greenhouse emissions.<p>

    The smart thing to do would be to research and develop both

energy-efficiency and pollution-control equipment, and then sell the

stuff to India and China. What's good for the environment is,

actually, good for the economy.<p>

    Bush appears to the Europeans, as a senior White House official put



it, "a shallow, arrogant, gun-loving, abortion-hating Christian

fundamentalist Texan buffoon." To dismiss this misimpression as a

function of European snobbism, leftism or anti-Americanism (as did a

splendidly ludicrous essay in The Wall Street Journal) misses the

point. We are supposed to be the pragmatists, the shrewd Yankees, but

Bush has embarked on two courses of folly simultaneously -- ignoring

global warming and National Missile Defense.<p>

    As for why we should care what Europeans think of us, as was said

at the beginning, "A decent respect for the opinions of Mankind"

lays that responsibility on us.
