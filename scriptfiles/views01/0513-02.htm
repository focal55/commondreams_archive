Los Angeles -- EVERY DAY the opposite of what you would expect happens routinely at an office building here. It teaches volumes about responsible energy policy.

<P>

<P>Amid  a broader atmosphere of electricity crisis, a bunch of officials sit around to try to figure out how much <i> surplus </i>electricity to send to the rest of the state after the needs of nearly four million consumers have been fully and safely satisfied.

<P>

<P>In recent weeks, the judgments made in the building  have  made the difference between partial blackouts and no blackouts in California. Even on days when one- or two-hour service interruptions have to be apportioned elsewhere, the surplus distributed from here  is the difference between annoyance and severe disruption.

<P>

<P>The entity that does this routinely doesn't just offer millions of people reliable service. It has been doing so for nine years without a single rate increase in a structure that was already cheaper than elsewhere even before natural gas and electricity prices skyrocketed.

<P>

<P>The entity is called Los Angeles.  The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power is the largest public power operation in the country, but it represents thinking that is as American as apple pie and too easily forgotten in the current madness.

<P>

<P>Half of the city's electricity comes from natural gas units in the area, the other half from a coal-burning facility in Utah. Typically, much less of that system is out of service for maintenance, scheduled and otherwise, than is the case in the rest of the state.

<P>

<P>The best symbol of how the Los Angeles department's record plays involves personnel. Just in the last several days, its widely praised director has been whisked off to Sacramento to become Governor Gray Davis's top adviser in the current crisis.

<P>

<P>And to add irony to symbolism, S. David Freeman, a veteran public servant, was put in his job  by outgoing Republican Mayor Richard Riordan. Few people are aware of it yet, but the relentlessly ambitious and independently wealthy Riordan is now considering a run at Democrat Davis next year.

<P>

<P>As one prominent politician told me this week, ''The only thing Davis fears as much as widespread blackouts, astronomical prices, and civil disorder is a self-financed opponent. What would make all this hilarious is if the Republican mayor, who installed a Democrat to run a public power authority in Los Angeles, were to run statewide as a conservative against a governor who will try to adopt as much of Los Angeles's lesson as possible, using the mayor's appointee.''

<P>

<P>At some point, the stable rates here will have to change, since half the electricity comes from natural gas. Both candidates in next month's mayoral election, city attorney James Hahn and former State Assembly speaker Antonio Villaraigosa, agreed in their first debate last week that some increases are unavoidable.

<P>

<P>Nevertheless, the fact remains that public power works, and as the rest of the nation prepares for some version of California's mess (in the form of sharply higher prices if not supply disruptions), drawing the right lesson is imperative.

<P>

<P>''The most important lesson for now is that long-term contracts for electricity with stable and lower prices are far better than the purchase of it on the spot markets at exorbitant prices,'' says Severin Borenstein, a business professor at the University of California at Berkeley and one of the state's most knowledgeable experts on the mess.

<P>

<P>The DPW has these contracts because it successfully fought to stay out of the shortsighted system of deregulation  adopted by the state five years ago. Now, Davis is trying to walk a tightrope back from that abyss - buying power for financially flopping utilities (he signed a $13.4 billion bond issue last week), leading a massive conservation campaign with incentives, trying to spread the pain of another $5 billion in rates hikes, negotiating payments from generating companies that gouge the state routinely, rushing a dozen new generating plants into operation, and jawboning  for transitional caps on wholesale prices.

<P>

<P>It's still too early to do more than guess about the state's prospects, and it helps to remember that 42 percent of all consumption is already exempt from blackouts and that more than half the state's customers have only seen 2 to 10 percent rate hikes.  But with the die cast for summer, places like LA and other public power localities (like Sacramento) that purchase their electricity but don't generate it are a lot better situated than those ''served'' by the private marketplace and face more secure futures.

<P>

<P>The message: Power to the people.
