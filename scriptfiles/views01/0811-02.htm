Just when evolutionists thought they were safe from the tempests of
creation “science”, a new movement is
blowing across school boards and state legislatures.  Get ready for
“intelligent design”.

<p>What is intelligent design (ID)?  And is it the union of faith and
science its proponents claim, or a Trojan
Horse sneaking reconstituted “neocreationists” in through the back door,
as claimed by its opponents?

<p>Largely attributed to biochemist Michael Behe, the theory argues that
when something can no longer be
broken down beyond a point of “irreducible complexity”, it displays the
presence, let’s say the hand, of
ID.  Behe uses the example of the basic mousetrap which, minus any one
of its parts, can no longer
function.  Therefore, he contends, the basic mousetrap could not have
“evolved” from simpler parts
organizing for that purpose, but must instead be the result of ID.

<p>Likewise, Behe claims there are living things whose smallest irreducible
parts could not have arisen from
evolutionary processes.  While not an easy concept to grasp, most
proponents are content with, “The
universe is so vast and wondrous, and the world so perfectly designed to
fit our needs, surely there is an
intelligence at work here.”

<p>Of course after ID has taken root in classrooms and boardrooms, the next
step would be to assign that
intelligence and name the designer.  Behe and others make no bones about
their motivation, and their
acceptance of a Judeo-Christian God as the Intelligent Designer behind
ID.

<p>Proponents have at least two things going for them.  First, after seeing
a backlash in Kansas and elsewhere,
creationists are regrouping behind perhaps the most unabashedly
conservative presidential administration in
recent memory.  Second, ID has appeal as a seeming compromise, one
promoted by real scientists with
impressive letters after their names, making it very tempting to
skittish politicians and school officials.

<p>So what is the response to this latest attack on evolution, this attack
on what, in an effort to reduce it to a
cult of personality, is often referred to as “Darwinism”?

<p>As even most ID’ers would admit, evolutionary theory has shed much light
on the processes of living
things.  Still, our knowledge is incomplete.  Like creationism, ID
relies on this lack of knowledge, this
doubt, for the dispersal of its seed.  So its proponents suggest that
evolution ceases to operate at the exact
edge of our current knowledge, right at the threshold of doubt.  But to
quote Stephen Hawking, “It seems
better to ... cut out all the features of the theory which cannot be
observed."

<p>And as Albert Einstein said, "Everything should be made as simple as
possible, but no simpler." Over time
ID would have to be applied to a shrinking number of systems and
organisms as the science and our
understanding in these areas grows.  It seems far likelier that
evolutionary processes, while imperfectly
understood, are still operating at these hidden scales.

<p>But since it is not infallible, the argument continues, why not make a
niche for other theories, ID for
instance?  But what if, before the cosmological flaws in Newtonian
physics were resolved by Einstein, Sir
Isaac’s discoveries and equations had been suppressed due to
imperfections?  How much might have been
lost?  While we should not discount the value of belief giving
perspective to science, even Isaac Newton,
closet alchemist himself, understood the dangers in imposing one upon
the other.

<p>Proponents may naturally select ID over creationism as their best hope
for a religiously-based biology in
schools.  Likewise, the theory of evolution continues to evolve.  There
is now a growing realization that
systems, living and not, can self-organize.  Ilya Prigogine and others
have observed chemical systems that
restructure themselves into completely new forms under certain
conditions, forms bearing little reducible
trace of their past.

<p>What if Behe’s smallest parts actually have organized, but for a
different purpose than the one ultimately
apparent?  For example, ID’ERs might conclude that flight feathers
represent an “irreducible complexity”.
Could they conceive of a part having initially evolved for another
purpose, warmth, and then reaching a
point of transcendent emergence, i.e., the threshold of flight?

<p>Self-organizing, emergent structures: the intelligence may lie within,
and not require the hand of a Western
God.  On the other hand, to say that a system is at a point of
“irreducible complexity” is to claim perfect
knowledge of that system; in other words, to claim a God-like
perspective.  This, therefore, makes
arguments for ID circular (if not ironic) and the theory unverifiable.

<p>There will always be magic and mystery in the world; thank God for
that.  Intelligent design, however,
appears to be just the latest flawed attempt at repackaging that mystery
as science, to further a very earthly
agenda.
