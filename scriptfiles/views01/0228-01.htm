Call me a fool. Call me naive. But until last month, I actually liked The Body. I liked having a Guv who wasn't a career politician or corporate clone, who grew up working-class, wore the occasional pink feather boa and didn't pretest every phrase in front of some focus group.

<P>He came into office beholden to no one. He made good appointments. He spoke plainly. So I forgave the dumb stuff he said about the Columbine massacre. I forgave the Playboy interview. I even shrugged off his XFL gig.</P>

<P>But in the last six weeks, I've felt something switch. Maybe it was watching a guy who's making an estimated $1 million for a few Saturday nights' work, parading around the University of Minnesota's Duluth campus, sneering at teachers' salaries and scoffing at student tuition bills. Maybe it was hearing him call education "a black hole." Maybe it was his Feb. 6 speech at the Capitol to 100 or so citizens from Duluth.</P>

<P>Ventura has been a celebrity for years -- it's how he continues to make the bulk of his income. Which may explain why he apparently expected the Duluth audience to be more like the kind he usually faces on "The Tonight Show" -- happy people, grateful to be in the studio, who laugh and applaud on cue. The smiling Guv began with a little ode to citizen involvement before talking about his two-year budget plan.</P>

<P>Everything was going fine until the serfs started talking back. They gave their opinions and asked questions, especially about the whole idea of tax cuts and rebates versus public investment, in schools, housing, health care and a few other little things.</P>

<P>In short, they acted like citizens instead of groupies, and suddenly Ventura became Yertle the Turtle, the King of the Stack. He told the turtles down at the bottom to hush up, quit interrupting and pay attention to "the facts."</P>

<P>"Your facts," said a woman in the audience. And Yertle abruptly ended his speech and stalked out of the room.</P>

<P>Well! So much for citizen involvement.</P>

<P>Maybe it's just me, but the big guy suddenly doesn't seem so refreshing anymore.</P>

<P>In fact, he's becoming positively retro. Take the new Official Media Jackal badges passes he's demanding journalists wear for "security reasons." It's very Chairman Mao, another security-obsessed bald guy who hated the press and peasants who talked back. What's next? Enemy of the People badges for opposition legislators? Intellectual Running Dog passes for university employees?</P>

<P>Although in fairness to the governor, the comparison to Mao Zedong is sort of a reach. These days he's actually reminding me more of Lawrence Kabila, the recently deceased president of Congo.</P>

<P>As observers of Africa may recall, Kabila became leader as sort of a fluke. There was a civil war and the guerrilla leader was at the head of a pack of dreary alternatives. When he became president in 1997, crowds of cheering citizens turned out to greet him, hoping a refreshing new era in government had begun.</P>

<P>But it turned out to be the same old deal. Kabila wasn't really interested in funding services like schools, transportation, health care and housing. Also, he was touchy. He hated the press, saw all political opposition as a personal attack and avoided any unscripted encounters with citizens. In the end, his political agenda was to simply play the Big Man and let the people fend for themselves.</P>

<P>The struggling citizens responded with an interesting form of protest. Whenever the Big Man's motorcade drove through the deeply rutted streets of the capital, people lifted their shirts and pointed to their flat, empty bellies as a point of comparison.</P>

<P>Apparently, Kabila became unnerved by the sight of thousands of people lifting their shirts, because he started driving around only at night. No one knows if the Bare Belly Salute caused his change in driving habits -- the guy didn't give interviews.,</P>

<P>But it may be gesture for Us Turtles At The Bottom of The Stack to think about here in Minnesota. Especially if our Big Man keeps stalking out of rooms when he's asked about schools, housing, health care and other little things.</P>

<P>Of course, it's winter. A little too cold to lift our shirts. And without deeply rutted streets, the motorcade drives by awfully fast. But in a couple of years, if the Guv gets his way on his budget, he may be seeing a whole lot of skin from struggling citizens who are trying to fend for themselves.</P>

<P>And who knows? He may decide to start driving at night.</P>
