The 4,000-square-foot house is a model of environmental rectitude.

<P>

   Geothermal heat pumps located in a central closet circulate water through

pipes buried 300 feet deep in the ground where the temperature is a constant

67 degrees; the water heats the house in the winter and cools it in the

summer. Systems such as the one in this "eco-friendly" dwelling use about 25%

of the electricity that traditional heating and cooling systems utilize.

<P>



A 25,000-gallon underground cistern collects rainwater gathered from roof

runs; wastewater from sinks, toilets and showers goes into underground

purifying tanks and is also funneled into the cistern. The water from the

cistern is used to irrigate the landscaping surrounding the four-bedroom home.

Plants and flowers native to the high prairie area blend the structure into

the surrounding ecosystem.

<P>

   No, this is not the home of some eccentrically wealthy eco-freak trying to

shame his fellow citizens into following the pristineness of his

self-righteous example. And no, it is not the wilderness retreat of the Sierra

Club or the Natural Resources Defense Council, a haven where tree-huggers plot

political strategy.

<P>

   This is President George W. Bush's "Texas White House" outside the small

town of Crawford.

<P>

   Yes, the same George W. who believes arsenic and drinking water might not

be such a bad combo, the same man who reneged on his campaign promise to lower

carbon dioxide emissions from power plants, the same man who is doing

everything in his power to fling open the Alaskan Natural Wildlife Refuge to

oil drilling.

<P>

   How does the President reconcile an eco-friendly abode for his own family

with his persistent stand against anything that smacks of an environmentally

friendly agenda for the nation as a whole? The answer to that perplexing

question is a real mystery.

<P>

   Perhaps sound ecological practices are only for those who can afford them:

as a self-proclaimed strict constructionist of the U.S. Constitution, Bush

must be aware that clean air and clean water are not guaranteed in that

glorious document. Perhaps in Bush's Brave New Corporate World, clean natural

resources are merely commodities in a free-market economy: if you can pay for

them, fine; if not, tough. The rest of us will just have to put up with more

toxic dumps and more public lands being turned over to logging, mining and oil

companies.

<P>

   According to David Heymann, the house's architect and associate dean of the

University of Texas architecture department, Heymann designed the house so

that "every room has a relationship with something in the landscape that's

different from the room next door. Each of the rooms feels like a slightly

different place."

<P>

   In a USA Today interview, Heymann said, "There's a great grove of oak trees

to the west that protects it from the late afternoon sun. Then there is a view

out to the north looking at hills, and to the east out over a lake, and the

view to the south . . . out to beautiful hills."

<P>

   I suppose in George W.'s architectural world only the rich and powerful

have views; vistas that the public owns as part of its shared heritage are up

for lease and sale.

<P>

   Heymann also termed the house "stunningly small." Really? Would it be

stunningly small for a single mother in South Central Los Angeles? How

stunningly small would it be for an immigrant Latino family in San Antonio

Maybe in the rarified heights where second homes are the norm, 4,000 square

feet is small and on a stunning scale as well, but in Main Street America that

much elbow room is pretty big for the first and only home.

<P>

   But then most of us can't reconcile what might at first glance appear to be

inherently irreconcilable. Maybe some day, like our noble president, we will

be able to make that kind of staggering mental feat. That is, if we ever stop

misunderestimating ourselves.
