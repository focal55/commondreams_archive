Summer vacation season is in full swing and across the land families

are packing up and hitting the highways along their beepers, fax

machines, mobile phones and laptops. Although across the Atlantic whole

countries shut down when their workers head for the beaches or the

mountains, Americans can't to be out of touch with the office as work

increasingly intrudes on personal and family life.





<p>Whether by choice, design or herd instinct, Americans are far behind

the rest of the world in annual vacation days. Italy leads the world

with 42 days a year. France has 37, Germany 35, Brazil 34, Britain 28,

Canada 26, and South Korea and Japan 25. The U.S. comes in at a paltry

13, according to the World Tourism Organization. But vacation days only

tell part of the story.





<p>Commute hours aside, Americans, particularly those with college degrees

who earn high incomes, are working longer hours. The government Current

Population Study (CPS) reveals that the proportion of Americans who

work more than 50 hours per week increased since 1970 and the annual

hours worked by all employees increased 142 hours since 1973. The

National Survey of the Changing Workforce finds that in 1997, Americans

worked 3.5 hours a week more than they did 20 years ago. Meanwhile

other leading industrial countries are cutting their workweek: People

in European countries typically work 32- to 36-hours a week.





<p>That we are working longer and harder comes as no surprise, but what

we're doing to ourselves? Ten-hour workdays were routine ten years.

Today increasing numbers of people work 12- to 14-hour days, some six

days a week. Add to this commute hours that increased drastically in

the past ten years. Higher paid workers in Silicon Valley may feel it's

worthwhile, especially for the executives of the Valley's largest 150

companies who took in an average of almost $60 million last year.





<p>These higher paid workers follow the "high commitment" work model,

which corporations find a godsend. Such employees place "excellence" in

work at the center of their lives. Meetings begin before 8 AM and last

until after 5 PM. Travel and education demands require them to be away

from home. Punishing schedules to meet deadlines become routine. They

skip lunch, take work home and skip vacations-the Oxford Health Plans

Inc. study found one fourth of all employees don't take all of their

vacation time. Managers encourage and pressure employees by modeling

"high commitment" behavior: They frequently come in early, stay late,

work weekends and skip vacations.





<p>Workers at the other end of the spectrum work just as hard, but with

fewer vacations and less pay. A study by the Harvard School of Public

Health found that working Americans lack vacation time and sick leave.

They can't even take time off when family members need care. Some 63

percent of the working poor lacked paid vacations during part of the

previous 7 years and 28 percent of the working poor have never had paid

vacations. On the pay front, the working poor are even worse off: While

the income of the wealthiest 1 percent grew 157 percent from 1979 to

1997, the lowest-earning 20 percent of Americans saw their income drop

from $10,900 to $10,800.





<p>Experts claim that Americans have to work harder and forego vacations

because we are transitioning from a manufacturing to a service economy

that requires attention 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Additionally, a

booming economy and low unemployment force people to work longer and

harder. Global competition, which brought major upheavals in how U.S.

companies operate, places new demands on our workforce.





<p>Despite these arguments, other countries are going through the same

economic changes and still take time off. What happened to the vacation

in America?





<p>Cindy Aron, author of <italic><i>Working at Play: A History of Vacations

in the U.S.</i>, </italic>claims that Americans have always valued

discipline, sobriety and industry and have a love-hate relationship

with vacations. The hate goes back to our puritanical disdain of

idleness and leisure. Not only do we take few days off, but we are also

driven to accomplish something during our vacations: We must learn,

improve ourselves or accomplish a goal. And we must stay in touch with

work, even when we are away. Capitalism could be another reason:

Americans don't enjoy vacations as a right but as a privilege granted

by their employers.





<p>While people in the rest of the world shake their head in wonder at the

paltry amount of time we take-off from work, many of us will soon be

loading the family into the car and heading to our favorite vacation

spot for a few days. Maybe it's a good thing that the slowing economy

is demanding that we take time off. It could be good for us.
