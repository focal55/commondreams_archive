BARBARA EHRENREICH'S hair has grown back in unmanageable curls, a 

revelation for a middle-aged woman who, until last year, couldn't have teased 

a wave from her hair if she'd plunged her head into a Mixmaster.

<P>The hair is now the only physical sign of Ehrenreich's recent bout with 

breast cancer.

<P>Well, the hair and the eye-popping essay in this month's Harper's magazine.

<P>Ehrenreich, the former Time magazine columnist and author most recently of 

"Nickel and Dimed: On (Not) Getting By in America," blasts what she describes 

as the pink-ribboned, teddy-beared, feel-good cult that has turned the 

horrible disease of breast cancer into some kind of a transformative rite of 

passage that offers women spiritual upward mobility and endless opportunities 

for self-improvement.

<P>"So pervasive is the perkiness of the breast cancer world," she writes, 

"that unhappiness requires a kind of apology."

<P>And: ". . .obedience is the message behind the infantilizing theme in 

breast-cancer culture. . .You are encouraged to regress to a little-girl state, to suspend critical judgment, and to accept whatever measures the doctors, as 

parent surrogates, choose to impose."

<P>I wolfed down the essay like popcorn, though not because I necessarily 

agree with Ehrenreich -- who knows if I would be as offended as she by the 

fluffy kitsch and smiley-face attitudes if I were stricken? I loved the piece 

because she said the unsayable.

<P>In these super-sensitive times when we navigate conversations as if tip-

toeing across a floor of puppies, such unrepentant candor -- about anything! -- stands out like red chiffon at a convent.

<P>"So far I've gotten positive responses -- 'Oh, thank goodness somebody 

finally said it' -- but I'm waiting for the hate mail, too," she said over 

iced coffee in a cafe near the UC Berkeley Graduate School of Journalism. 

Ehrenreich, who has a Ph.D. in cell biology, is in Berkeley teaching a five-

week course on essay writing and another in sociology.

<P>When she was diagnosed, her primary emotion was of righteous anger. She 

hated that the existing treatments caused horrible nausea, hair loss, 

disfigurement, shattered sexual confidence, lost time at work.

<P>She found that while the richest and most mainstream breast-cancer 

organizations looked for "the cure," they weren't spending much time or money 

unmasking environmental causes of the disease. Hooking up with environmental 

activists might chase away corporate donations. AstraZeneca, for example, 

sponsored Breast Cancer Awareness Month. Until a reorganization in 2000, this 

company was also a leading producer of pesticides, Ehrenreich writes, 

including acetochlor, classified by the EPA as a "probable human carcinogen."

<P>This led the Cancer Prevention Coalition to condemn Breast Cancer Awareness 

Month as "a public relations invention by a major polluter which puts women in 

the position of being unwitting allies of the very people who make them sick."

<P>As for the corporations, Ehrenreich writes, involvement in the breast 

cancer effort is a way of appealing to the middle-aged female market "without 

being feminist."

<P>As an experiment, Ehrenreich posted a statement on one of the many breast-

cancer Web sites. She listed her complaints about treatments, insurance 

companies, environmental carcinogens and "sappy pink ribbons." She received a 

chorus of rebukes.

<P>"You need to run, not walk, to some counseling. . .I ask everyone on this 

site to pray for you so you can enjoy life to the fullest," wrote one 

respondent.

<P>Many women who have suffered through the disease, Ehrenreich said, don't 

see how "you can get through the treatment experience without convincing 

yourself it's a makeover."

<P>"The potential harm in all this," she said, "is the intolerance of the 

human variance of emotion. You're slapped down, if you express anger. There's 

something wrong with that."

<P>For her, breast cancer will never be a source of identity or pride. It is 

an abomination that cannot be tied up nicely in a pink ribbon.

<P>"I know this much," she writes. "I will not go into that last good night 

with a teddy bear tucked under my arm."</p>
