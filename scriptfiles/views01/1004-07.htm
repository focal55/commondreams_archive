THERE are many contenders for biggest political

opportunist since the September 11 atrocities. Politicians ramming through

life-changing laws while telling voters they are still mourning; corporations

diving for public cash; pundits accusing their opponents of treason.

<p>

Yet amid the chorus of draconian proposals and McCarthyite threats, one voice

of opportunism still stands out. That voice belongs to Robyn Mazer, who is

using September 11 to call for an international crackdown on counterfeit

T-shirts.

<p>

Not surprisingly, Ms Mazer is a trade lawyer in Washington DC. Even less

surprising, she specializes in trade laws that protect America's single largest

export - copyright.

<p>

That is music, movies, logos, seed patents, software and much more. Trade

related intellectual property rights (Trips) are among the most controversial

side-agreements in the run-up to next month's World Trade Organization meeting

in Qatar.

<p>

It is the battleground for disputes ranging from Brazil's right to disseminate

free generic Aids drugs, to China's huge market in knock-off Britney Spears

CDs.

<p>

American multinationals are desperate to gain access to these large markets for

their products - but they want protection. Many poor countries, meanwhile, say

Trips cost millions to police, while strangleholds on intellectual property

drive up costs for local industries and consumers.

<p>

What does any of this trade wrangling have to do with terrorism? Nothing,

absolutely nothing. Unless, of course, you ask Ms Mazer, who wrote an article

last week in the Washington Post headlined -  From T-shirts to terrorism: That

fake Nike swoosh may be helping fund bin Laden's network.

<p>

She wrote: "Recent developments suggest that many of the governments suspected

of supporting al Qaeda are also promoting, being corrupted by, or at the very

least ignoring highly lucrative trafficking in counterfeit and pirated products

capable of generating huge money flows to terrorists."

<p>

"Suggest", "suspected of", "at the very least", "capable of", that is a lot of

hedging for one sentence, especially from someone who used to work in the US

department of justice. But the conclusion is unambiguous: You either enforce

Trips, or you are with the terrorists.

<p>

Welcome to the brave new world of trade negotiations, where every arcane clause

is infused with the self-righteousness of a holy war.

<p>

Ms Mazer's political opportunism raises some interesting contradictions.

<p>

Robert Zoellick, US trade representative, has been using September 11 for

another opportunistic goal - to secure "fast track" trade negotiating power for

George W Bush, the president.

<p>

According to Mr Zoellick, trade "promotes the values at the heart of this

protracted struggle".

<p>

What do new trade deals have to do with fighting terrorism? Well, the

terrorists, we are told again and again, hate America precisely because they

hate consumerism: McDonald's and Nike and capitalism - you know, freedom. To

trade is therefore to defy their ascetic crusade, to spread the very products

they loathe.

<p>

But wait a minute. What about all those fakes Ms Mazer says are bankrolling

terror?

<p>

In Afghanistan, she claims, you can buy "T-shirts bearing counterfeit Nike

logos and glorifying bin Laden as 'The great mujahid of Islam'".

<p>

It seems we are facing a much more complicated scenario than the facile

dichotomy of a consumerist McWorld versus an anti-consumer Jihad.

<p>

In fact, if Ms Mazer is correct, not only are the two worlds thoroughly

enmeshed, the imagery of McWorld is being used to finance Jihad.

<p>

Maybe a little complexity is not so bad. Part of the disorientation many

Americans now face has to do with the inflated and over-simplified place

consumerism plays in the American narrative.

<p>

To buy is to be. To buy is to love. To buy is to vote. People outside the US

who want Nikes - even counterfeit Nikes - must want to be American, must love

America, must in some way be voting for everything America stands for.

<p>

This has been the fairy tale since 1989, when the same media companies that are

bringing us America's War on Terrorism proclaimed that their television

satellites would topple dictatorships the world over.

<p>

Consumerism would lead, inevitably, to freedom. But all these easy narratives

are breaking down.

<p>

Authoritarianism co-exists with consumerism, desire for American products is

mixed with rage at inequality.

<p>

Nothing exposes these contradictions more clearly than the trade wars raging

over "fake" goods. Pirating thrives in the deep craters of global inequality,

when demand for consumer goods is decades ahead of purchasing power.

<p>

It thrives in China, where goods made in export-only sweatshops are sold for

more than factory workers make in a month. In Africa, where the price of Aids

drugs is a cruel joke. In Brazil, where CD pirates are feted as musical Robin

Hoods.

<p>

Complexity is lousy for opportunism. But does help us get closer to the truth,

even if it means sorting through a lot of fakes.
