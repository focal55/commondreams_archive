Genius is largely a matter of being in the right place at the right 

              time. And, of course, it helps if you bring a camera.

<P>Case in point: Shaya Mercer.</P>

            <P>Back in the summer of 1999, when "Seattle" was still just the name 

              of a rainy town on the West Coast, Mercer scraped together enough 

              money to produce a documentary on protests that were scheduled to 

              coincide with the fall meeting of the World Trade Organization in 

              that city. It was a risky bet, as demonstrations outside the esoteric 

              sessions of esoteric international trade bodies had, up to that 

              point, developed a reputation for being, er, esoteric. Not to mention 

              small.</P>

            <P>Mercer, a native of Seattle whose parental pedigree is equal parts 

              longshoreman and earthmother, bet that her hometown would produce 

              the protest heard 'round the world on Nov. 30, 1999. And she turned 

              out to be right.</P>

            <P>Tens of thousands of trade unionists, farmers, environmentalists, 

              animal rights activists and students poured into the streets of 

              the city &#151; rerouting presidential motorcades, raising a ruckus 

              and, ultimately, preventing the WTO from reaching a "Millennium 

              Round agreement" that would have significantly broadened the shadowy 

              trade organization&#146;s ability to help multinational corporations 

              avoid having to obey labor, environmental and human rights laws.</P>

            <P>It was a historic moment in the struggle for democracy and justice, 

              and Mercer was there with her camera and crew &#151; capturing it 

              all from start to finish. The result was "Trade Off," a brilliant 

              behind-the-scenes exploration of the issues, the people and the 

              events that made the name "Seattle" synonymous with the ever-expanding 

              fight against corporate globalization. Awarded "best documentary" 

              honors at the 2000 Seattle International Film Festival, "Trade Off" 

              was selected for screening at the Human Rights Watch International 

              Film Festival and it has earned plaudits from just about everyone 

              who was on the right side of the barricades in Seattle. Says Jerry 

              Mander, president of the International Forum on Globalization: "No 

              film better captures the spirit, chaos, joy, power and meaning of 

              the Battle of Seattle, than Shaya Mercer&#146;s 'Trade Off.' "</P>

            <P>"Trade Off" is coming to Madison this weekend, just in time for 

              the next of the many battles after Seattle. Friday and Saturday 

              screenings at 7 p.m. in Humanities Room 3650 on the University of 

              Wisconsin campus, and a 7:30 p.m. Sunday showing at the WilMar Center, 

              953 Jenifer, are a perfect prelude to the April 20-22 "Summit of 

              the Americas" in Quebec City, where President Bush will join leaders 

              of other Western hemisphere nations to launch the push for a Free 

              Trade Agreement of the Americas &#151; "NAFTA on steroids." Outside 

              the summit&#146;s 10-foot-tall "security fence," tens of thousands 

              of protesters will be busy bringing a little Seattle-style rabble-rousing 

              to Canada.</P>

            Madison will see plenty of activism in support of the Quebec protests. 

            In addition to the Friday, Saturday and Sunday screenings of "Trade 

            Off," for instance, "This Is What Democracy Looks Like," an excellent 

            Seattle documentary put together by Independent Media Center activists, 

            will be shown at the Bartell Theatre at 7 and 9 p.m. Wednesday. There 

            will, as well, be panel discussions, demonstrations, rallies and other 

            events. (For a full schedule, call 877-710-3700, Ext. 972, or email
