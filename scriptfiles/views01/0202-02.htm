PORTO ALEGRE, Brazil -- The question, from a participant here at 

the World Social Forum, was polite and understated: "Sometimes, one wonders 

if the poor political consciousness and the lack of information about the 

world of the standard American is not one of the problems of the world 

today. Do you think we all could help in some way to get Americans more 

aware of the rest of the world?"



         <p>The question -- directed at me because I'd just given a speech -- 

hung in the air while my brain fumbled for a fitting response. Programming 

decisions by U.S. media executives loom large at home and abroad. A hundred 

years ago, when Queen Victoria died, the sun never set on the British 

empire. Today, around the world, the market shares are shimmering for AOL 

Time Warner, the Walt Disney Co. and Rupert Murdoch's News Corp.



         <p>When I tuned into CNN International in this city on Brazil's 

southern coast, a report about fashion was explaining that "today's 

revolutionary woman" prefers to wear chiffon. More Spanish-speaking people 

on the planet get their news from one website -- CNNenEspanol.com -- than 

from anywhere else on the Web. Editors in Atlanta and Washington, employed 

by a subsidiary of AOL Time Warner, are deciding what news and views will 

reach huge numbers of readers online.



         <p>Corporate media globalization is part of what's come to be known 

as "neo-liberalism" -- worldwide policies giving top priority to 

corporations and their quest for maximum profits. As part of the movement 

to challenge neo-liberalism, about 4,700 delegates and 10,000 other people 

from 122 countries participated in the first-ever World Social Forum to 

share information and develop strategies.



         <p>Key concerns of the global South -- where extreme poverty and 

rampant inequities are ever-present -- came through loud and clear here in 

Porto Alegre. The men and women crowding into overflow sessions included 

1,700 journalists. But in the United States, even the most avid news 

consumers didn't learn much about this auspicious convergence.



         <p>Don't blame the wire services. For a week, some of the world's 

biggest -- including the Associated Press -- produced a steady stream of 

informative news reports from Porto Alegre. But the day after the World 

Social Forum adjourned, when I did a search of the comprehensive Nexis 

database, it was clear that the event didn't make the U.S. media cut.



         <p>The Washington Post did better than most American outlets, but it 

wasn't much -- a single news story on Jan. 27. The Los Angeles Times didn't 

mention the World Social Forum at all. Neither did USA Today.



         <p>During the week, the country's "paper of record" -- the New York 

Times -- published only one paragraph on the subject, rendered in McPaper 

roundup style. "BRAZIL: ORDERED OUT -- The French farm workers' leader Jose 

Bove, best known for vandalizing McDonald's restaurants to protest 

globalization, has been detained by the federal police and ordered to leave 

Brazil. The action came after Mr. Bove, at a forum in Porto Alegre held to 

counter a world leaders' meeting in Davos, Switzerland, joined Brazilian 

farmers in attacking a farm owned by the Monsanto Corporation, which grows 

genetically modified soybeans."



        <p>Readily available AP stories had offered much more context for the 

Bove incident. For instance: "Bove and about 1,300 farmers destroyed five 

acres of soybeans at the Monsanto farm near Porto Alegre last Friday, 

saying the beans were genetically engineered. At the Forum's closing rally, 

Bove urged the Landless Workers' Movement to reoccupy the farm and turn it 

into an environmentally friendly operation." At that rally, thousands of 

people chanted: "Bove is my friend, touch him and you touch me."



         <p>Landless workers of Brazil and a leader of French farmers joined 

together to fight for redistribution of land, social justice and 

environmental protection. It was a dramatic alliance -- just one of many 

that flowered at a highly disciplined and creative international conference 

of activists from all over the world. There were hundreds of other highly 

significant stories to be told from the World Social Forum. Most U.S. news 

outlets didn't tell even one.



        <p>National Public Radio did send a correspondent to Porto Alegre, 

and a pair of his reports aired. On "Morning Edition," NPR correspondent 

Martin Kaste provided a rather upbeat definition of "neo-liberalism," 

describing it as "the American-inspired philosophy that smaller government 

is better."



         <p>NPR's final report from Porto Alegre mentioned a proposed policy 

step toward reducing the world's extreme economic disparities. But in that 

"All Things Considered" piece, the subject came up not to be explored but 

to serve as a setup for a cutesy -- and disparaging -- tag line.



         <p>"One of the most talked-about plans is a worldwide tax on 

international financial transactions, something that defenders say could 

raise money for developing countries while at the same time making it 

harder to move funds across borders," the news report said. "Even this 

concept, however, is not embraced by everyone. At the start of the 

conference, an anti-globalization delegate from Holland was seen loudly 

cursing the Brazilian cash machines for not accepting her Dutch ATM card. 

Martin Kaste, NPR News, Porto Alegre, Brazil."



         <p>From North America, it's difficult to get a clear look at the 

global South -- and at the pro-democracy movement against corporate rule -- 

with nose pointed high in the air.
