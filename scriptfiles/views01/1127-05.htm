 THE IDEA of Spanish authorities giving Americans a lecture on civil liberties is not something we're used to.

<p> Coming from a country that until 24 years ago was a model of fascist authoritarianism baptized in the blood of a generation, it seemed the height of legalistic, self-righteous conceit. 

<p> Yet all the Spaniards were asking was that eight alleged terrorists found on Spanish soil and charged with complicity in the Sept. 11 attacks be tried in civilian U.S. courts as fastidiously as the one that tried Timothy McVeigh, the Oklahoma City fertilizer bomber who was convicted on the evidence and in an open court as surely as he would have been by a summary military drumhead held in some secret dungeon.

<p> If extradited from Spain to the United States, these defendants could certainly expect little mercy in U. S. jurisdictions where ambitious prosecutors would stand in line drooling for the chance to be the first lawyer to nail a Sept. 11 defendant. Whole legal careers are made of such lucky breaks. 

<p> Yet Americans continue to be amazed that the rest of the civilized world, in which capital punishment has been largely abolished, does not share its lust to dig up Old Testament-style punishments and to start handing them out in President George W. Bush's assembly-line military tribunals. I've even heard morons on cable channels debating whether it's all right to torture suspected terrorists. 

<p> One thing terrorists have in common is an indifference to their own safety and a tendency to court death as a first-class ticket to martyrdom in which future generations will write songs to their heroism. 

<p> This had to be what was in McVeigh's mind when, after blowing up a federal building, he displayed an indifference to capture so bold that he drove down a public highway without a license plate. It's what drove a generation of Irish terrorists to imagine the beery anthems that would be sung to their memories. And it's what caused men of devout Muslim backgrounds to divert planes into the World Trade Center.

<p> The last favor we should do for these sorts of people is give them the sort of pseudo-trials that even old Nixon apologists like William Safire have described as "kangaroo courts." The death penalty is something a sociopath like Hermann Goring must have been grateful for as he contemplated the possibility of a life sentence eating sauerkraut. When he was sentenced to death at Nuremberg, he had the last laugh on his jailers by cheating the hangman and swallowing poison. The war crimes tribunal in Japan that hanged Gen. Hideki Tojo in 1948 only finished the job he'd tried to do earlier on his own in a suicide attempt after the surrender.

<p> The urge to start ritualistically frying people for crimes of Sept. 11 can never be a substitute for the sort of methodical police work, intelligence gathering, clever surveillance and increased airline security that are better safeguards against such atrocities happening again. 

<p> Nothing infuriates a willing martyr, more punishes his soul, than to be denied the glory he seeks. It almost amounts to a sadistic form of decency.
