WASHINGTON — It was bad enough when fat cats got to buy the Lincoln Bedroom. It will be worse if they can begin the bidding for Abe's frock coat.

<P> The Smithsonian Institution has been roiled by griping from staffers, historians and academics that its secretary, Lawrence Small, is Disneyfying and dumbing down.</P>

<P> The man who opened his own private museum of Amazonian bird feather art in a D.C. apartment ruffled lots of feathers last month when he announced plans to create a donor's $38 million dream of a "Hall of Achievers," perhaps featuring Martha Stewart and Oprah Winfrey.</P>

</font></font>Now disgruntled Smithsonianites slip me a stunning in-house list titled "Unit Naming Opportunities."

<P> It was not the usual inventory of treasures in the Nation's Attic, from Abe's coat to Teddy Roosevelt's teddy bear to Ike's five-star red pj's.</P>

<P> It was an inventory of all the nooks and crannies that the Smithsonian could sell off to sponsors. Possibilities for plutocrats to have plaques slapped on rotundas, balconies, bird gardens, orchid exhibitions, the tower clock.</P>

<P> The litany of vendible sites — everything except the Raiders' Lost Ark — makes the Clinton fund-raising efforts look relatively tame.</P>

<P> I can already visualize a vodka logo by the collection of human and monkey shrunken heads: "Absolut Shrunken Heads." Wouldn't Orvis love to champion the drawer of 12,000 Arctic fishing tools? And Dorothy's ruby shoes by Jimmy Choo?</P>

<P> The list suggests that rich folk might want to buy immortality by sticking their names on the Smithsonian's suburban Maryland warehouse of surplus art and artifacts.</P>

<P> "Note: The entire Suitland complex could be a single naming opportunity, or it could be broken into pieces," the list says, citing the Child Care Center, the parking lot and the Fumigation Facility. That one would take a special sort of sponsor. Orkin?</P>

<P> The most charming hook for charitable capital is the crypt. The crypt, a k a the tomb room, has an asterisk disclosing that this lugubrious chamber poses a special challenge to the brave new fund-raisers on the Mall.</P>

<P> "This room is already named as Smithson's Crypt," the list states, referring to the museum founder James Smithson. "However, a donor could be named as providing upkeep."</P>

<P> Mr. Small's livid critics, who rip him as "a Philistine" and "a suit," contend that this bizarre document is a perfect reflection of the gung-ho- grovel-before-the-corporations mentality that the former Citibank and Fannie Mae  executive espouses.</P>

<P> June's Smithsonian magazine has a Ford ad on the cover, which actually turns out to be a cover for the cover.</P>

<P> "What's next?" said Stores Olson, a senior ornithologist at the Museum of Natural History. "The Exxon White House? The Microsoft<org idsrc="NASDAQ" value="MSFT"></org> Supreme Court? The Barnes & Noble<org idsrc="NYSE" value="BKS"></org> Library of Congress?"</P>

<P> Mr. Small rebuts that donors often name stuff after themselves: "The Smithsonian was named after James Smithson." (But that used to be the end for naming, not the starting point.) He calls the list "a first shot at fantasy fund-raising."</P>

<P> "I can't conceive of putting a plaque on the Smithsonian clock," he says. "The list is funny in some places." In some places?</P>

<P> He says it wasn't his idea: "It was a first attempt by people in the most threadbare back-room area of the Smithsonian, the finance and administration area, trying to find ways to raise money in the private sector." The staff did it!</P>

<P> There is a hastily called Regents meeting for the museum tomorrow, a group that includes the chief justice of the Supreme Court, the vice president and lawmakers. Mr. Small says he called it to discuss the African museum. Many staffers hope Mr. Small is the big topic of discussion.</P>

<P> In a sure sign of desperation, the secretary did try to ride the furry (coat)tails of the two new pandas he rented from China for the National Zoo (where, in the best Smallish tradition, a fake panda at the entrance holds a Fuji Film sign). "They're terrific!" he gushes.</P>

<P> He says he has to raise billions to yank the museum into the 21st century: "Young people today have to be communicated with. . . . Grandparents are seeing the same exhibits they saw when they were kids."</P>

<P> But what's wrong with objects of art and objects of history staying the same? It's called tradition. </P>
