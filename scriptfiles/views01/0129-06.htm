Salt Lake City Olympic bid executives were furious when they learned that

Nagano, Japan, had beaten them out for the 1998 Winter Games by allegedly

paying $100,000 per vote to members of the International Olympic Committee.

Determined not to come up short again, key Olympic officials from the

Beehive State apparently decided to employ underhanded tactics of their own

in a no-holds-barred effort to bring the Winter Games to Salt Lake in 2002.



<p>Two top Salt Lake Olympic organizers face trial this summer on federal

bribery and conspiracy charges. The litany of transgressions are by now well

established. IOC delegates were plied with cash, gifts, lavish trips, and

scholarships for their children. Supplying young, nubile escorts for

visiting dignitaries wasn't particularly unique, but adding a year's supply

of Viagra was an original flourish on the part of bid officials.



<p>Salt Lake and Nagano representatives chased the games for similar reasons.

They hoped that hosting the Olympics, the great Circus Maximus of planet

Earth, would generate huge exposure and increased tourism. A boon for local

real estate interests, the Olympics are the ultimate global media

extravaganza, a nonstop infomercial for the host city that gets to strut its

stuff to the rest of the world, while multinational corporations pay

millions to sponsor the games and TV networks pay billions for broadcast

rights.



<p>But the pseudoreligious aura of the five-ring Olympic logo – which is

supposed to symbolize athletic excellence and international peace through

friendly competition – has obscured the negative environmental fallout from

the games in recent years.



<p>"Nagano was a dirty Olympics," says Peter Berg, director of the Planet Drum

Foundation (www.planetdrum.org). Berg and other green activists do not want

to see a repeat performance in Utah.



<p>The Olympics pose many formidable environmental challenges involving waste

management, energy consumption, transportation, materials recycling, and

major construction projects that damage the natural landscape. But the

Winter Olympics, even more so than the Summer Games, are particularly prone

to wreaking havoc on the ecosystem, according to Berg, "because they impact

a relatively isolated, snow-covered, mountainous area, which is overwhelmed

by a sudden human influx, monumental traffic, increased energy consumption,

and waste production on a scale the place has never seen before."



<p>Based in San Francisco, Berg formed Planet Drum in 1973 to provide "an

effective grassroots approach to ecology that emphasizes sustainability,

community self-determination, and regional self-reliance." In the mid 1990s,

he teamed up with Kimiharu To of the Deep Ecology Resource Center in Japan,

and they launched Guard Fox Watch, a monitoring effort that focused on

environmental problems related to the Winter Olympics in Nagano.



<p>Even before the crowds descended upon Nagano, native plant and animal

communities were disrupted or destroyed by clear-cutting forests and

bulldozing land for new buildings. Red monkeys, hawks, eagles, owls, and

other species were driven out of once pristine habitats that had been

ravaged by 75 miles of newly constructed, soil-eroding roads so large

numbers of athletes and spectators could access sporting venues. In

addition, the watershed was poisoned by hundreds of diesel buses spewing

black soot onto snow banks, while roadways were smothered with an inordinate

amount of salt and other chemicals to remove ice and keep transportation

routes open 24 hours a day during the two-week competition. The steep

mountain slopes guaranteed that all the effluent from ground and air

pollution would gravitate downward, ending up in concentrated form in the

Ishigawa River.



<p>The net result was the worst ecological disaster in Nagano's history. "It

was the biggest thing to hit that valley since the last Ice Age," Berg says.



<p>And to top it off, local residents were left to foot the bill for expensive

infrastructure projects that did not serve community needs. These unwanted

facilities will cost every family in the Nagano district approximately

$32,000 over a 20-year period.



<p>After the 1994 Winter Games in Lillehammer, Norway, the IOC adopted an

ambitious set of eco-guidelines that emphasized environmental protection and

sustainable development. Endorsing a "proactive" and "dynamic approach" to

achieve green goals, the IOC introduced environmental requirements for

would-be host cities. But the new marching orders were optional for

organizers whose bid had already been accepted by the IOC, so they didn't

apply at Nagano.



<p>The Salt Lake Olympics, which will start on Feb. 8, 2002, and continue for

17 days, is mandated to be the first environmentally sound Winter Games. "We

are hoping to improve environmental conditions, not just keep them the

same," asserts Diane Conrad, director of the Salt Lake Organizing

Committee's environmental programs.



<p>Conrad contends that next year's Winter Games, played out against the peaks

of the Wasatch range, will avoid the pitfalls of Nagano by making use of

already existing venues in the Salt Lake area and limiting construction to

three new facilities. Olympic officials say they plan to restore and expand

wetlands at one building site, while recontouring the landscape at another

site to prevent agricultural run-off into the headlands of the Provo River.



<p>But many people are unhappy about the large, ugly scar on the mountain at

the Winter Sports Park, where ski jumps are being built. Salt Lake

Organizing Committee president Milt Romney admits they made a mistake. "It

happened before I came on board," Romney says. But he maintains that the

blighted hillside will be mitigated by an extensive tree-planting campaign.



<p>"That's less than a Band-Aid," counters Berg, who is not impressed by the

tree-planting scheme. Berg and his Japanese colleague met with Salt Lake

Olympic organizers in February 1999 and urged them to establish a series of

baseline measurements with respect to air and water quality, energy

consumption, road and air traffic density, solid waste disposal, wildlife

populations, and other environmental factors. Without objective baseline

indicators, Berg argues, it won't be possible to prove whether the stated

goal of a net positive environmental impact for the Winter Games has been

achieved.



<p>Berg feels a sense of urgency. "If these baseline monitoring procedures are

not initiated by the beginning of February 2001, there will not be

sufficient data to compare environmental conditions before, during, and

after the 2002 Olympics," he explains. "All talk of a green Olympics will

merely be anecdotal."



<p>Berg maintains that the Winter Games should not only avoid being

environmentally destructive – they should be "sustainability instructive,"

as well. Next winter, the eyes of the world will be riveted on Salt Lake. He

wants the Olympics to become "a showcase for sustainable development." With

this mind, Guard Fox Watch provided the Salt Lake Organizing Committee with

a detailed list of recommendations that included state-of-the art techniques

for energy conservation; dual-use plumbing systems for recycling "gray

water" in athlete's quarters; compost toilets; subsidizing vendors of

locally produced organic food; and maintaining "wild corridors" through

event venues so that roaming animals and can move freely.



<p>Utah Olympic officials emphasize that Salt Lake City is the largest

metropolitan area ever to host the Winter Games, and they don't expect to

exceed the design limits of the urban systems that are already in place.

They claim that traffic restrictions during the competition will actually

reduce air pollution. They also envision a large-scale recycling program to

accomplish their goal of "zero waste," which means that everything used

during the games would be made from biodegradable or recyclable material.



<p>But the response from members of the Salt Lake Organizing Committee has been

less than satisfactory, as far as Berg is concerned. After several months of

foot-dragging, they informed Guard Fox Watch that they lacked the necessary

funds to collect and analyze the baseline data required to measure

environmental impacts during the games.



<p>"Then how will we know if Olympic officials have fulfilled their promises?"

Berg asks. "Even if the data showed that they had fallen short of

expectations, at least they could say they made an honest effort. It would

have been a precedent-setter, a model for future Olympics and other outdoor

sports spectacles."
