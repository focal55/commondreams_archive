I'm middle-aged, middle-class, work with computers in local government, and have a comfortable life living in the British countryside with my husband. All in all, I'm an average Brit.

<P>Growing up I remember listening to Alistair Cooke each week with his "Letter from America." Amusing, ironic, a vast place of amazing people both like and unlike us. It seemed to be a good place, despite its vastness. A place where ordinary people cared about what happened in their neighborhoods, had a sense of community, a belief in individual responsibility.</P>

<P>Over the years I have counted many Americans among my friends. Good-hearted people, direct people. A little loud maybe, but decent, honest folk who were always there when it mattered.</P>

<P>We are all shaped by our childhood, carrying our early prejudices and beliefs into adult life. Even now when I hear a North American accent I pay more attention. I gladly cross the street in London to help a tourist with a problem, whether he's lost or she can't work out how to read a bus timetable. It's almost second nature.</P>

<P>Now I don't know what to think or how to behave with you. We speak the same language, but that's it. </P>

<P>What has happened to you? Where have you gone? Did I just imagine you?</P>

<P>This week I heard that George W. Bush has decided to walk away from the Kyoto agreement on pollution because it isn't in America's "economic interest." </P>

<P>I want to scream. Rage. Shock. Horror. Despair. I want to take you by the shoulders and shake you. To wake you from your inward-looking slumber.</P>

<P>Unless we do something to stop it, global warming will destroy every advance we have achieved in the last 2,000 years. Our planet's weather is going to hell in a basket -- floods, droughts, tornadoes and hurricanes. </P>

<P>In the UK we've had nearly five feet of rain in the last 12 months -- more than we've had since records began in the mid-1700s. Farmers' crops are dying in the fields across from my house -- waterlogged. We could start growing rice. But the problem with that is two years ago this area had less rainfall than the Sahara desert and we're told it will happen again. </P>

<P>The rest of the planet's in no better shape -- including the U.</P>

<P>The USA produces 24 percent of the greenhouse gasses in the world today. </P>

<P>Do you care?</P>

<P>Or are really just waving two fingers at the rest of us? I hope not -- I thought you were better than that. I thought we were friends.</P>

<P><I>Janet Norman-Philips lives in  Suffolk, England.</I>
