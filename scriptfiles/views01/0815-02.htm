            <p> The morning after I returned from a two-week trip to Israel and 

              the Palestinian territories, I awoke to appalling news. 

            <P>A suicide bombing by a member of Hamas, a Palestinian liberation 

              group, killed at least 15 people, including several children, last 

              Thursday during lunch hour at a crowded pizzeria in downtown Jerusalem. 

              The bombing came in retaliation for an Israeli attack July 31 that 

              killed eight people, including two Hamas members, in the West Bank 

              city of Nablus. Hamas is one of several Palestinian groups seeking 

              to end the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip through 

              political and military means. 

            <P>I had just come back from a two-week trip with Christian Peacemaker 

              Teams, a pacifist group that documents human rights abuses and works 

              with Israelis and Palestinians to promote peaceful and just means 

              for ending the ongoing warfare. 

            <P>Before I left, several well-intentioned acquaintances politely 

              informed me I was crazy. &#034;Palestinians don&#039;t know any 

              way other than violence,&#034; they said. &#034;They kill Jews left 

              and right, after all that the Israelis have done for them. Pacifism 

              won&#039;t work in the Middle East.&#034; 

            <P>This perception is understandable. As Israeli Foreign Minister 

              Shimon Peres so astutely pointed out after Thursday&#039;s atrocity 

              in Jerusalem, the world has allowed rogue militants to speak for 

              all of Palestine. &#034;If we say we won&#039;t talk under fire, 

              it means every mad gunman can decide there will be no dialogue.&#034; 

            <P>At the same time, we ignore Palestine&#039;s lively peace movement 

              - you, dear reader, have likely never heard of it, even though it 

              works at a grass-roots level in every Palestinian community throughout 

              the occupied territories. 

            <P>And by our silence, we condone Israel&#039;s own atrocities against 

              the Palestinian people. The Israeli death toll from the current 

              10-month conflict is around 140. In the same period, more than 550 

              Palestinians have been killed. As with the Israeli deaths, many 

              of the dead Palestinians were civilians who just happened to be 

              in the wrong place at the wrong time. 

            <P>That&#039;s right. Middle East terrorism goes both ways. 

            <P>Aweek ago Monday, I visited a desert community of about 75 cave-dwelling 

              shepherds near the West Bank town of Yatta. Only two weeks before, 

              the Israeli Defense Forces had bulldozed every one of the community&#039;s 

              centuries-old caves, burying clothing, cars and even live sheep 

              under tons of rock. When the Red Cross supplied emergency tents 

              to the families, the Israelis returned with their heavy machinery 

              and buried those as well. 

            <P>An elderly shepherd named Jaber led me from crumbled cave to crumbled 

              cave. It was early in the afternoon, a time when most Middle Easterners 

              stay indoors or under a canopy. But Jaber and I had no choice. The 

              entrances to the caves were blocked by jagged stones, crumpled cars 

              and torn tents. His face glowed a deep pink from days on end of 

              living under the desert sun with almost no access to shade. 

            <P>He led me past his surviving goats and sheep, several of whom were 

              gnawing on a fallen tree, to the cave where he had kept them at 

              night and during the harsher parts of day. Through a gap in the 

              stones, we could see buried containers of feed. &#034;Everything 

              is in there,&#034; he said in Arabic. &#034;I have no food to give 

              them.&#034; 

            <P>The Israeli government has justified the cave demolitions, saying 

              that they were built without the required construction permits. 

              Israel has used this process to block virtually all Palestinian 

              construction - schools, homes, you name it - on these lands. 

            <P>And it regularly demolishes structures that predate the 1967 permit 

              law in order to make way for Israeli colonies in the West Bank that 

              are illegal under international law. In its occupation of the Palestinian 

              territories, Israel continuously violates the Fourth Geneva Convention, 

              which outlaws attacks against civilians and forbids permanent settlements 

              by any nation outside of its boundaries, even though Israel itself 

              pushed for this convention and signed onto it. 

            <P>These home demolitions are only one part of Israel&#039;s ongoing 

              policy of harassing, impoverishing, torturing and killing Palestinian 

              civilians in an effort to force them to flee their homeland. 

            <P>Take the two children and several bystanders who were killed as 

              &#034;collateral damage&#034; during the Israeli attack two weeks 

              ago in Nablus. Or the Palestinian pacifist, Isaac Saada, who was 

              murdered by the Israeli Defense Forces last month in Bethlehem. 

              Or my Palestinian friend who was stopped by an Israeli security 

              officer as he drove on an ostensibly Palestinian-controlled road, 

              ordered out of his car, beaten and threatened with death. Or my 

              encounter early last week with a group of Israeli soldiers who surrounded 

              my group&#039;s Palestinian taxi drivers and calmly discussed kidnapping 

              and torturing them, forgetting that the Israeli peace activists 

              among us would understand Hebrew. 

            <P>The policy of terror is working. Jacob, a Palestinian friend of 

              mine who lives in Beit Jala, a village just outside of Bethlehem, 

              recently told me of his plans to move to Bolivia. The tourist-dependent 

              Bethlehem economy has crashed since the beginning of this intifada. 

            <P>&#034;There&#039;s no work,&#034; he told me. &#034;And I&#039;m 

              sick of this shooting.&#034; He waved his hand in the direction 

              of Gilo, a walled Israeli settlement that stands like a fortress 

              on a nearby hill. Besides housing Israelis, Gilo holds a military 

              outpost that regularly barrages Bethlehem and its surrounding villages 

              with shells and machine gun fire. 

            <P>The night before, Jacob and I had huddled in a corner room of the 

              house with several other friends as Israeli bullets zipped through 

              the hallway and burst holes in the gas and water tanks on the roof. 

            <P>Israel claimed that the shelling was in response to Palestinian 

              gunfire. If so, why did the Israeli Defense Forces blanket residential 

              areas with bombs and bullets, rather than targeting the handful 

              of gunmen who were acting in opposition to the majority will of 

              Beit Jala residents? 

            <P>The Israeli government is as guilty as Palestinian military groups 

              of waging war against civilians. But unlike Hamas or Islamic Jihad, 

              it is using U.S. taxpayers&#039; money to do so - to the tune of 

              $2.23 billion in military aid a year. 

            <P>It is time for the United States to wake up and hold Israel accountable 

              for its war crimes.
