So let's see - you're in your last year of school and freaked out about the 

gloomy job picture? Just heard about those 250,000 laid off last month and 

wondering how you'll be able to make a decent living? No problem! With the 

new "War on Terrorism" and billions of war dollars suddenly floating around, 

a whole world of opportunity has opened up! OK, so it would be much easier 

just to own a big airline, make major contributions to Bush's presidential 

campaign, receive billions in subsidies and then lay off 100,000 workers 

anyway. You can be sure someone made a nice little profit out of that. But 

for the rest of us there are some great options too.



<p>Like, how about joining the military industrial complex! The Central 

Intelligence Agency (CIA) is hiring. Their website (<a href="http://www.cia.gov" target="_new">www.cia.gov</a>) says that 

if you have "unquestionable loyalty" then you can "play a key role in the 

intelligence process" in areas like technology or "clandestine service." You 

only have to be 18 years old to apply, and "students are given a salary and 

excellent benefits." Of course a major advantage is being based at 

Virginia's George Bush Center for Intelligence with its "lovely grounds" and 

artwork that "adds extra interest to the busy day." Former CIA officer Greg 

Poteat was on MSNBC just last week talking about how many new jobs are 

opening up for those who "have what it takes," and with both (Former CIA 

Director) Bush Sr. and Bush Jr. aboard the CIA bandwagon, you can bet those 

jobs are secure.



<p>You prefer equation solving to spying? How about cracking codes for the 

National Security Agency (NSA, w<a href="http://ww.nsa.gov" target="_new">ww.nsa.gov</a>)? The largest employer of 

mathematicians in the United States, the NSA searches for "weaknesses in 

adversaries' systems" and according to its website, is "constantly asking 

the big questions." Too bad it doesn't mention what those big questions are, 

but they must be really important. You only have to be 16 to apply for 

student programs, and the website even has a Kid's Page where you can play a 

game with Codey (get it?) The Owl. And with all of the 

eavesdropping/wiretapping/surveillance legislation that US attorney-general 

John Ashcroft would like to push through, this group will definitely not 

have to worry about funding for a very long time.



<p>But maybe you can't stand desk jobs and prefer a little excitement and 

variety in your daily life. So ... why not become a terrorist? The US 

government has a long history of financing terrorist groups - Osama bin 

Laden and Co. included. It's common knowledge that in the 80's, the 

US-Egypt-France  and others organized radical Islamic forces to fight 

against the Russians, and that "anti-Communist freedom fighter" Osama bin 

Laden and other members of the Afghan mujahadeen were funded to the tune of 

$2 billion. Just months ago, Washington offered $43 million to the Taliban 

to reduce the number of opium poppies in Afghanistan; the Taliban's 

sheltering of terrorists and human rights track record didn't seem to matter 

so much back then. In fact, the definition of terrorist changes so often, 

and is so politically based - one day you might even be called a hero! 

Before 1990, Saddam Hussein got great reviews from the US government, even 

as he was gassing the Kurds. And wasn't Indonesia's Suharto "our kind of 

guy," even while butchering East Timor? Looks like Putin's slaughter in 

Chechnya will be ignored, now that he has become a "War on Terror" freedom 

fighter; same with abusive governments in Turkey, Sudan etc. So don't worry 

about social stigma - you'll be in great company. After all, remember that 

the US is the only country ever condemned by the World Court for 

international terrorism (for the "unlawful use of force" for political ends 

in '80s Nicaragua). Hey - if it's OK for Uncle Sam, then it's OK for you.



<p>Prefer a life of leisure? Then dump those moral convictions and become a 

weapons manufacturer. The US has pumped $60 billion of arms into the Middle 

East since the Gulf War, 80% going to the Arab States. At the same time, 

Israel has been granted almost $3 billion in military aid annually, 

presumably to buy weapons to protect itself against all of those Arab arms. 

So, no matter how you slice it, looks like great business! And even if 

you're the Pentagon's second largest defense contractor and a massive 

recipient of tax-payer-funded corporate welfare, there's no need for 

patriotism in profit sharing! In 1999, Boeing joined a European company 

(MBDA) to compete against fellow US companies to win a prized air-to-air 

missile contract (The Wall Street Journal Europe, 10-04-01) and Mike Marks, 

vice president for weapons programs at Boeing, sees a winner in the new war 

market: missile related income is up 50%, and while Boeing planned to hit 

the billion dollar missile business in four years, Marks says "We'd really 

like to exceed that target significantly."  Noble goal. And don't worry 

about international laws aimed at curbing the weapons flow - laws such as UN 

Security Council resolution #687 which calls for region-wide disarmament 

efforts in the Middle East, or that pesky Anti-ballistic Missile Treaty 

threatening Bush's beloved Star Wars. Laws that get in the way of corporate 

profit don't count.



<p>Did you major in public relations? Then why not become a journalist and read 

governmental press releases on TV! You can think of cool movie-related names 

for war (i.e. CNN's "The United States Strikes Back" - get it?) and report 

at length on the army's latest sexy weapons. But it's really important not 

to talk about certain stuff. Like DON'T mention the US government's 

long-term support of the Afghan mujahadeen, or the fact that many of the US 

national security strategists who made the original mistake years ago are 

right back in office now. And don't bring up the fact that the States has a 

record of fighting against legislation to curb (terrorist and other) money 

laundering, like the fact that last May it strongly opposed the Organization 

for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) initiative for greater 

transparency in tax and banking matters. But be sure to say good things 

about John Negroponte, the new Ambassador to the United Nations, in his 

"fight against terror" even though Negroponte directly supported state 

terrorism in the '80s by covering up right-wing death squad abuses in 

Honduras when he was ambassador there. You get the idea.



<p>So remember - there's a world of opportunity out there for those who "have 

what it takes." And it's OK to ask the big questions once you're told what 

they are.
