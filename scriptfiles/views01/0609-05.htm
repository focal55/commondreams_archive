PARIS - The killings in Israel and the Palestinian territories have not only inflamed again the enmity between Jews and Arabs in other countries, which had been mellowing since the Oslo accord. They have provoked new arguments among Jews inside and outside the state.

<p>Israelis are proud that for the first time in 2000 years of persecution, they have created a nation that is capable of protecting Jews from mass attack. And Jews in the Diaspora are proud of Israel's many peaceable achievements and grateful, however silently, that at last they have a haven in case of dire need.

<p>Both groups understand that the success of Israel depends on the active support of Jewish communities around the world. That was how the Zionist movement became a state. And once Israel was established as a state, it was accepted that the crucial decisions about its policies and its politics would have to be made by the people who live there.

<p>They have the vote. They are &quot;in the front line,&quot; as it is put, meaning that they bear the physical risk when there is fighting. They accept the everyday burdens and commitments that continue to make it a well-functioning country.

<p>But now there is an increasingly strained argument about the obligation of Jews in the rest of the world to provide unquestioning aid and endorsement for Israel at a time of danger, renouncing the right to judge the wisdom of its government's decisions. From Los Angeles, Robert A. Levine, a former U.S. official, wrote to challenge the view that whatever it does, Israel must be defended (<i>&quot;The Jews of the Wide World Didn't Elect Sharon,&quot; IHT June 5</i>). 

<p>Predominant international opinion has long been a major force, and therefore an important stake in the Middle East conflict. Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader, based his strategy on winning through foreign sympathizers the recognition and territory he could not extract from Israel directly.

<p>He got as far as the Clinton-Barak proposal. But it wasn't far enough for him and his followers, and while the resort to intense violence made clear how perilous the situation remains, it brought Mr. Arafat the additional risk of losing again on the opinion barometer.

<p>Within the range of attitudes that Mr. Arafat faces among non-Arabs, those of the United States and Western Europe matter especially because the weight of these states, above all that of the United States, is crucial to both the diplomacy and the military and economic implications of the struggle. And American Jews do have a big voice in American policy on the Middle East. That is why Mr. Arafat has now responded to the demand that he call an immediate and unconditional cease-fire.

<p>If he appears to do his best to make it work and seek a way out of the violent impasse, the burden of pressure will shift to Prime Minister Ariel Sharon of Israel, whose use of air power and deliberate assassination win him applause from the most militant of Israel's backers but serious criticism from most others.

<p>It is ironic to hear Mr. Sharon denounce Mr. Arafat as an &quot;assassin and pathological liar&quot; because Israel's founding prime minister, David Ben-Gurion, chose to describe Mr. Sharon as brilliant but a compulsive liar. In any case nothing that Mr. Sharon finds to say about Mr. Arafat or the Palestinians gives any credibility to his declaration in an interview with Le Monde that he &quot;knows better than his predecessors how to make a deal with Arabs.&quot;

<p>Mr. Sharon's only visible strategy is endless confrontation until one side or the other admits exhaustion. Mr. Sharon has said he will not negotiate until violence ends but has offered no plan for negotiation.

<p>The issue is not whether Palestinians are justified in continuing attacks on Israel in various levels of retaliation. It is what is to be done to press the search for peace. That is the essential salvation for Israel and the only relief for Palestinians.

<p>The way for sympathizers to defend Israel and for Arabs to help Palestinians includes an obligation to criticize words and deeds that only add to the hatred and prevent any resolution of the conflict.

<p>There are times when the appearance of loyalty is in fact pernicious, when blind support for folly is more folly.
