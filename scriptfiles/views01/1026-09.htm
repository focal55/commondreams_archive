Some principles are so important that

they cannot be violated even in a time of

national emergency. One of those, it now

appears, is the principle of patent rights for

multi-billion dollar pharmaceutical companies.



<p>Bayer, the German pharmaceutical giant,

finally reached agreement with the US

Department of Health and Human Services over

the price at which it would sell its antibiotic

CIPRO to our government. CIPRO is believed

to be one of the most effective treatments for the

possible strains of anthrax infection that we

might confront, and the government has decided

to stockpile it.



<p>Since Bayer cut its price from $1.77 to

$0.95 per tablet, some see this latest agreement

as a victory for the public interest. But that is

debatable.



<p>"Relying on just one manufacturer to

produce our entire supply of the pharmaceutical

is simply not the best way to ensure an adequate

supply," Senator Charles Schumer wrote in a

letter to Health and Human Services secretary

Tommy Thompson. It was pressure from

Schumer, as well as from consumer groups, that

led to the price cuts.



<p>This pressure caused Thompson to

reverse his position of just a week earlier and

threaten to buy generics if Bayer didn't cut its

price. But why be concerned about patents

during a health emergency? The government has

the right, under more than one law, to purchase

generic drugs. Bayer will not necessarily be able

to produce the required stockpile as quickly as it

could be obtained if all sources, including the

generic ciprofloxacin, were available. Why

should we take that risk?



<p>CIPRO will still be making a small

fortune here, even at the reduced price. Like

most drugs, ciprofloxacin is cheap to produce:

the generic version in India sells for about 3

cents per pill.



<p>But Thompson's threat to go the generic

route was probably not all that serious. The

$350 billion pharmaceutical industry is one of

the largest corporate campaign contributors,

currently favoring Republicans by about than 2

to 1. These people got their money's worth:

Bayer, the producer with the patent monopoly,

will remain the sole supplier for the US market.



<p>This is especially important to them right

now. While millions of Americans are worried

about anthrax, the Bush Administration is

preparing for a new round of negotiations next

month at the World Trade Organization.

Remember that last meeting in 1999 that fell

apart under clouds of tear gas in Seattle? It has

taken nearly two years for the trade ministers to

put the pieces back together. And this time, the

problem of patents is high on the agenda.



<p>Our government (with some help from

other rich country governments and of course

the big drug companies) has spent the last

decade trying to force poor and middle-income

countries to pay patent-protected prices for

essential medicines. They have brandished the

weapon of economic sanctions, filed lawsuits,

and -- most recently -- initiated complaints at

the WTO. But they have been losing ground

since last year, when the US press discovered

that millions of people would have to die in

order for these patent rights to be protected.



<p>Among the proposed human sacrifices

are 36 million people in developing countries

who have HIV or AIDS. This, too, is a health

emergency, with thousands dying every day.

Many of them could be saved with drugs that

generic producers can sell for $350 a year, but

cost $10,000 here in the United States.



<p>During the past year the drug companies

were shamed into offering some discounts on

AIDS medications in poor countries. But for the

most part they did everything they could to keep

their patent monopolies intact. When the trade

ministers meet in Qatar beginning November 9,

the developing countries will try to clarify their

rights under WTO's TRIPS (Trade Related

Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights)

agreement. They want to be able to produce or

purchase generic essential medicines.



<p>Leading the fight against them will be

our own US Trade Representative. Now we can

see why the public safety of Americans must

take a back seat to patent rights, even in the

presence of unknown threats of bio-terrorism.

How can our leaders tell the rest of the world

that patents are more important than people, if

they don't practice what they preach here at

home?
