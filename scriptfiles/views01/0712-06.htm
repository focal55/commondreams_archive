With all eyes on Israel-Palestine, a similar conflict is heating up elsewhere 

in the Middle East and the US has recently taken the wrong side. Reversing 

years of US policy, former Secretary of State James Baker III is currently 

pressuring the UN to recognize the Moroccan annexation of Western Sahara. 

This is a dangerous shift. Not simply does it reward aggression while 

exempting our ally from international law, but it undermines US claims to 

support democracy and self-determination across the globe.



<p>Since invading Western Sahara in 1975, Morocco has systematically expelled

several hundred thousand natives, 160,000 of whom have spent 25 years living

on aid in tents in vast desert refugee camps. Almost immediately, the UN 

declared the invasion illegal, calling for a referendum over future status. 

But Morocco opted for 10 years of warfare to impose its claims, justifying 

its occupation as part of a quasi-divine reunification of the once divided 

nation. At the same time, Morocco also began moving settlers into the area. 

In 1991, the UN finally brokered a cease-fire by promising the indigenous 

population the right to vote over their fate. These people are still waiting. 

Meanwhile, the settlers continue flow in as Morocco tries to stack the deck 

by arguing that these new arrivals should vote in the referendum.



<p>Now, the US and France are pushing to drop the plebiscite entirely and it 

looks like the UN may cave under the pressure. For the time being the issue 

has been tabled due to opposition from other countries within the UN Security 

Council. No one knows exactly how rich the contested territory is in 

phosphorus reserves, and the US prefers to have these reserves in the hands 

of its loyal ally Morocco.



<p>US-Moroccan ties have always been strong. While Secretary of State under 

Reagan, Baker was helped consistently by Hassan II, the previous Moroccan 

king. For example, in 1986 Hassan invited Shimon Peres to a secret meeting in 

Morocco, breaking with Arab solidarity on the Palestinian front. Hassan also 

remained silent when his radars picked up American planes on their way across 

the Mediterranean to attempt to assassinate Qaddafi in 1987. In the years 

before that, the old king always made Moroccan troops available to act as 

mercenaries for French policing actions in West and Central Africa.



<p>Some are still standing by international law on the issue. Senators Edward

Kennedy, James Inhofe, Patty Murray, Bob Smith and John Kerry recently sent

a letter of protest to Colin Powell which reaffirms their commitment to the

original UN position that the people of the Western Sahara have a right to a

fair and free referendum. Likewise, most of the members of the Organization

of African Unity have recognized the legitimacy of the indigenous

population's claims to the Western Sahara.



<p>Supporting Morocco's invasion sends a dangerous message to world leaders

seeking to expand. It also fosters internal instability as Morocco diverts

billions of dollars from the needs of its population toward militarizing its

border and implanting settlers. The conflict has severely corroded regional

relations as Morocco, Algeria and Mauritania remain on the verge of open

warfare. By taking the side of an absolute monarchy, standing against human

rights and against those who strive for a more democratic system, the US

only further tarnishes its image in the Middle East.



<p>Whether the case is Iraq in Kuwait, Indonesia in East Timor or Israel in

Palestine, international law must be upheld and expansionism opposed. No

state, not even a US ally, has the right to annex and depopulate a territory.
