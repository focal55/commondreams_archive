Free Market Capitalism has become the dominant American ideological

truth. The decline of communism opened the door for unrepentant free

marketers to boldly espouse market competition as the final solution for

global harmony. According to the American mantra, if given the

opportunity to freely develop the marketplace will solve all evils. We

will enjoy economic expansion, individual freedom, and unlimited bliss

by fully deregulating and privatizing society’s socio-economic

institutions.

<p>The recent selection of G.W. Bush as the U.S. President has placed into

power the party that is the strongest supporter of this American mantra.

The business/government revolving-door cabinet will be comprised of more

corporate CEO’s than any presidency in recent history. The new

government elite will work to see that the American mantra remains safe,

globalized, and unchallenged.

<p>Pesky socialist or nationalist leaning governments will be undermined,

pressured into compliance or even invaded if they dare to resist the

American mantra. The full force of U.S. dominated global institutions

— WTO, World Bank, IMF, NAFTA — will focus on maximizing free market

circumstances and corporate access to every region of the world.

Economic safety nets, environmental regulations, labor unions, human

rights, become second place to the free flow of capital and investments.

Indigenous resisters face overt repression, disappearance, or

imprisonment by governments fully armed and supported by the American

dominated New World Order.

<p>So what is the underlying rationale for this American mantra? Are its

dogmatic beliefs based on specific socio-economic facts? Are free market

forces clearly the best mechanism for human betterment? Do these

mechanisms work cross-culturally and are they efficient under all

circumstances?

<p>A closer examination of the American mantra reveals that "free market"

essentially means constant international U.S. government intervention on

behalf of American corporations. A public-private partnership that

utilizes U.S. embassies, the CIA, FBI, NSA, U.S. Military, Department of

Commerce, USAID, and every other U.S government institution to protect,

sustain, and directly support our vital interest—U.S. business.

<p>This public-private partnership means that the government of Guatemala

is pressured to withdraw laws that forbid Gerber foods from marketing

their chubby baby image on infant formula. Peasants see the baby and

believe that formula will make their infants healthy and chubby as well.

Yet breast feeding is considerable healthier in a country where unsafe

water mixed with formula results in high infant mortality.

<p>The American mantra claims that prices will reach their lowest levels

and consumers will benefit from free market competition. Yet living

essentials, food, water, housing, health care, all have the

international tendency to increase more rapidly than products that are

non-essential. Even in the U.S we can get a great deal on a computer,

but try buying emergency health care on a middle income paycheck.

Americans are often amazed to find out that prescription drugs are

significantly cheaper in other countries, a fact that discredits the

benefits of an unregulated market.

<p>American mantra institutions push market deregulation that transforms

foreign economies for the benefit of U.S. businesses. Post-NAFTA

Mexicans are now importing U.S. grown corn for their tortillas, as

millions of formally subsidized peasant farmers leave the land to seek

minimum wage work in the cities of United States. Los Angeles has become

the center for new American sweatshops, as "illegals" compete for

poverty jobs, citizens cannot afford to accept.

<p>Government-assisted foreign market penetration by U.S firms often

results in the buying out of successful indigenous companies and the

competitive overwhelm of others. This situation leaves U.S.

multinationals in dominate positions in foreign domestic markets and

creates win-fall profit taking opportunities.

<p>The free market mantra carries with it shock treatment policies of

lowering public expectations, forced austerity measures, and dismantled

human services. A privately run water system is deemed superior to a

public system because the profit motive will create maximum efficiency.

Yet there is absolutely no research that systematically compares public

verses private efficiency levels, only the dogmatic assertion that this

is so.

<p>The American mantra affects the U.S. population as well. We are still

riding on the betterments from the first three/quarters of the 20th

century, and have not faced the full impacts of the economic bifurcation

that has occurred the past 25 years. Poverty levels are rising, the

working poor expanding and homelessness one pay check away for many. In

the last quarter century the bottom 60 million Americans have

economically declined, and most of the next 100 million have barely held

their own, while the dot.com generation elites have socked away

fortunes.

<p>It is time to re-examine the American mantra and speak for global

humanity. We must establish business socio-economic accountability

standards and reacquaint our government with its responsibility for

maintaining the common good.
