We were still reeling from the Bush 

lexicon. Now here comes the Warnacular. 

In less than a week, many familiar terms 

have taken on new meanings. Here's a 

partial list: 

<p>



The United States = "America" 

<p>



America = "the Civilized World."

<p>



An attack on the World Trade Towers and 

the Pentagon has become an attack on 

the American "way of life."

<p>



Anyone who hates America hates freedom 

and democracy. Why might someone be 

motivated to carry out last week's attacks? 

"Obviously he's filled with hate 

for the United States and for everything we 

stand for... freedom and 

democracy," Vice President Dick Cheney 

told Tim Russert on Sunday's "Meet The 

Press." He went on, "It must have 

something to do with his background, his 

own upbringing." Nothing to do with U.S. 

policy. Cheney wants us to believe 

that parents are to blame. 

<p>



Speaking of democracy. Democracy, these 

days = Bipartisanship. What does 

bipartisanship mean? Why, Democrats 

agree to everything Republicans want, of 

course. It's unanimous when the vote is 

420 to 1 and that one is a an African-

American female from the peacenik Bay 

Area.

<p>



Allies are states that support the U.S. 

president no matter how unilaterally he 

acts. Will critics of the U.S.A. be called 

racist or anti-semitic? Probably that 

comes next.  But we're getting ahead of 

ourselves. 

<p>



The biggest news this week is that 

patriotism has become holding on to, or 

better yet, buying stock. Anyone who sells 

on New York's newly reopened 

trading floor, is "betting against America," 

says Richard Grasso, chairman of 

the New York Stock Exchange and a 

chorus of newly dubbed "civic leaders" 

(which is to say brokers and corporate 

executives, Warren Buffett et al.,) 

agree.

<p>



What will make us safer? Security comes 

from permitting the FBI into our 

phone conversations and releasing the 

CIA to work with "unsavory characters," 

yeah, even human rights abusers and 

possibly terrorists. It's worked so well 

in the past. For safety's sake, the U.S. 

must "not rule out", as John McCain of 

the Senate Armed Services Ctee put it, the 

possibility of using nuclear 

weapons against any country at any 

time.

<p>



If we the people let it happen, "War 

Powers" will become the power to get the 

media to declare that we are in a war.  

Grief will have become a cry for 

killing.

<p>



Normalcy (which has entirely replaced 

normality for some reason) will be all 

we long for. And Normalcy, it seems, is to 

carry on doing exactly what we did 

before. Exactly what got us here. </p>
