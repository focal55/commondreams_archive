To sign-on to the statement, please send an e-mail mentioning organization and country to: <a href="mailto:ceo@xs4all.nl">ceo@xs4all.nl</a> To be part of the list of sign-ons from the start of the Bonn summit, we need your response before Monday July 16th. Later responses are also very welcome, as we will release an updated list in the second week of the conference. </i>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Current attempts to entice 

            the US government to recommit to the Kyoto Protocol are likely to 

            further accelerate the corruption of the Treaty. To save the Kyoto 

            Protocol, talks should urgently shift focus from the current market 

            mania, to discussing effective and fair solutions to climate change, 

            beginning with domestic reductions of greenhouse gas emissions by 

            the industrialized countries.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At last November's UN climate 

            summit in The Hague (COP-6), Northern governments and corporations 

            were only inches away from being allowed to 'fulfill' their reduction 

            commitments through various inventive but seriously flawed market-based 

            ('flexible') instruments. This included creating global emissions 

            markets, encouraging a scientifically dubious trade in 'carbon sinks' 

            (carbon absorption via trees, wood products and soil) for emissions, 

            and the promotion of nuclear energy. These escape clauses would have 

            allowed the industrialized countries to significantly increase their 

            emissions (instead of reducing them by the average 5.2% as agreed 

            upon in Kyoto).</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The debate since COP-6 

            has revolved around the US government's open rejection of the Kyoto 

            Protocol. Other governments are so eager to placate the US in order 

            to get them back on board that they appear ready to compromise the 

            Protocol's environmental, social and moral integrity. Therefore, there 

            is a real risk that the UN climate summit in Bonn (COP 6, part 2) 

            will result in an entirely corrupted treaty that would unleash a global 

            market in fraudulent emissions credits and do nothing to help stabilize 

            the greenhouse gas emissions that cause climate change.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Many corporate ventures 

            that might become eligible for emissions credits - nuclear power plants, 

            so-called 'clean coal' plants as well as industrial agriculture and 

            large-scale tree plantations (including genetically engineered varieties) 

            - have extremely serious negative social and environmental impacts. 

            Investments in 'carbon sinks' (such as large-scale tree plantations) 

            in the South would result in land being used at the expense of local 

            people, accelerate deforestation, deplete water resources and increase 

            poverty. Entitling the North to buy cheap emission credits from the 

            South, through projects of an often exploitative nature, constitutes 

            'carbon colonialism'. Industrialized countries and their corporations 

            will harvest the `low-hanging fruit&acute; (the cheapest credits), 

            saddling Southern countries with only expensive options for any future 

            reduction commitments they might be required to make.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Carbon credits are envisioned 

            to be sold through a global emissions market, a concept that suffers 

            from fundamental flaws. Firstly, allowing immediate trade in emissions 

            permits (carbon credits) in effect means granting unequal private 

            property rights to the atmosphere. This system of property rights 

            would consolidate the historic overuse by Northern industry at the 

            expense of the South (80% of all CO2 emitted since 1850 has come from 

            the North). A market without clearly defined property rights can never 

            function and the unfair property rights that underlie the currently 

            proposed emissions markets will eventually be rejected by those losing 



            out.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Moreover, the proposed 

            emissions markets lack a workable accounting system, another essential 

            element of a functioning market. A market which assumes that emissions 

            cuts are climatically equivalent to planting trees, constructing new 

            'clean coal' plants or engaging in other pseudo-solutions, is deeply 

            flawed. Global carbon stocks and flows cannot be quantified in the 

            way such a market requires. Unverifiable emissions credits would flood 

            the market, turning the trading system into a farce. The net effect 

            would be to subsidize greenhouse gas emissions and exacerbate the 

            climate crisis.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The fact that the property 

            rights issue is unresolved and deeply contentious and that the proposed 

            accounting system is fraudulent, should be sufficient reason to call 

            off the launch of global trade in emissions credits. Attempting to 

            regulate (for instance with 'caps' or trying to close 'loopholes') 

            a market with such fundamental flaws is bound to fail. If unleashed 

            now, the multibillion-dollar global emissions markets would develop 

            their own disastrous dynamic. Given the bias towards corporate interests 

            by neoliberal governments and international institutions, once these 

            markets have been allowed to operate and expand, it will be virtually 

            impossible to close off the lucrative trade in fraudulent emissions 

            credits.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The North has a moral obligation 

            to make the deepest cuts in greenhouse gas emissions, instead of using 

            the South as a carbon dump. In particular, transnational corporations 

            and international financial institutions must be held accountable 

            for their central role in fueling the climate crisis. Reducing fossil 

            fuel use, which ultimately means keeping fossil fuels in the ground, 

            is the only effective way to avoid escalating climate change.</font></p>
