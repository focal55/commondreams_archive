BY THE TIME funding for five years of abstinence-only sex education 

is up for congressional reconsideration next year, U.S. taxpayers will have 

handed over about a half-billion dollars for it in federal and state money.

<P>Too bad we're just now studying whether such a narrow approach actually 

works to lower the teen pregnancy rate or inspire kids to postpone having 

sexual intercourse.

<P>Then again, when House and Senate Republicans tacked on an abstinence-only 

sex-ed package to the 1996 Welfare Reform Act, their primary objective had 

little to do with proven methods or even what the majority of American parents 

want.

<P>According to a congressional staff report discovered and quoted by the 

Sexuality Information and Education Council of the United States, the goal was 

to ignore reality and bankroll a one-size-fits-all dream of the religious 

right:

<P>Just say no to sex, kids.

<P>"Regardless of how one feels about the standard of no sex outside marriage . . . the intent of Congress was clear," said the staff report. "This standard 

was intended to put Congress on the side of social tradition -- never mind 

that some observers now think the tradition outdated -- that sex should be 

confined to married couples."

<P>Never mind either that more than half of teenagers engage in sex by the 

time they are in high school. Never mind that, while the teen birth rate has 

dropped to a 20-year low, we still lead the developed world in unplanned teen 

pregancy, abortion and in teen sexually transmitted diseases (STD).

<P>Never mind that 1 of 4 sexually active adolescents has an STD. Never mind 

that almost half of new HIV cases occur in people under age 25. Never mind 

that the National Institutes for Health calls abstinence-only sex education an 

"obstacle to reducing the risky behaviors among teens" or that the National 

Academy of Science says that mega-funding for such a program is "poor fiscal 

and public health policy."

<P>At least next year, when welfare reform and abstinence-only sex education 

must win reapproval from Congress, differing voices will be raised. Along with 

findings from a federally funded study that finally is in progress, a host of 

experts on the subject of teenage sexuality will weigh in.

<P>Among them is research scientist Douglas Kirby of the National Campaign to 

Prevent Teen Pregnancy (<A HREF="http://www.teenpregnancy.org/053001">www.teenpregnancy.org/053001</A>). In a new report that 

was four years in the making, Kirby shares the positive news of his review of 

250 teenage sex education programs in the United States.

<P>The best news: Eight existing programs significantly reduce teen pregnancy 

and the spread of STDs, even for at-risk kids. Five are strictly comprehensive 

sex education (including abstinence as an option), two are community service 

programs with group discussions, and one is a combination of sex ed, health 

care and supportive activities.

<P>Equally helpful: Kirby's analysis revealed that giving kids information 

about condoms or other birth control -- indeed telling them where to get 

contraception -- did not cause them to have sex earlier or increase the 

frequency.

<P>As for the efficacy of abstience-only programs, only three programs met the 

scientific research criteria necessary for review. So far, says Kirby's report, "the jury is still out" but the early evidence "is not encouraging."
