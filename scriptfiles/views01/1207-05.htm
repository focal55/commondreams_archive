right to tell people what they do not want to hear."



     

<p>From all indications, the gatekeepers for big media in the United

States don't want to hear what Noam Chomsky has to say -- and they'd prefer

that we not hear him either.



     

<p>Mainstream journalists in other nations often interview Chomsky. Based

at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, he's a world-renowned analyst

of propaganda and global politics. But the chances are slim that you'll ever

find him on a large network here at home.



     

<p>Chomsky is ill-suited to providing soundbites -- and that's not just a

matter of style. A few snappy words are sufficient when they harmonize with

the conventional wisdom in a matter of seconds. It takes longer to

intelligibly present a very different assessment of political realities.



     

<p>No one disputes that Chomsky revolutionized the study of language more

than 40 years ago. The rich and powerful have no quarrel with his work as

the world's most significant linguist. But as a political analyst, he's

pretty much persona non grata at big U.S. networks and influential dailies.



     

<p>Meanwhile, overflow audiences of thousands are routine when Chomsky

speaks on college campuses and elsewhere in the United States. For many

years now, community radio stations across North America have featured his

speeches and interviews on political subjects. Progressive magazines publish

his articles.



     

<p>But at major media outlets, most editors seem far more interested in

facile putdowns of Chomsky than in allowing space for his own words. Media

attacks on him are especially vitriolic in times of international crisis and

war.



     

<p>Since Sept. 11, the distortions have been predictable: Although he's an

unequivocal opponent of terrorism in all its forms, Chomsky is portrayed as

an apologist for terrorism. Although he's a consistent advocate of human

rights for all, Chomsky is accused of singling out the U.S. government for

blame.



     

<p>To some extent, Chomsky seems to bring the media salvos on himself.

Even when the brickbats are flying, the guy just won't keep his head down.

He speaks bluntly when the Pentagon terrorizes faraway civilians in the name

of fighting terrorism. And he points out that citizens of the most powerful

country on Earth have special opportunities and responsibilities to work

against deadly policies implemented in their names with their tax dollars.



     

<p>Chomsky's latest book, titled "9-11," is now arriving in bookstores. It

's a collection of interviews, serving as a badly needed corrective to news

coverage of the present-day "war on terrorism."



     

<p>The book will be very useful in the months to come. Yet "9-11" just

scratches the surface. For those who want more depth, many superb Chomsky

books are available -- including the classic study "Manufacturing Consent"

(co-authored with Edward S. Herman), "Profit Over People" and "The New

Military Humanism," as well as volumes of interviews conducted by David

Barsamian.



     

<p>In "9-11," Chomsky speaks without evasion: "We should recognize that in

much of the world the U.S. is regarded as a leading terrorist state, and

with good reason." Chomsky cites many examples of U.S. actions that resulted

in the killing of several million civilians during the past few decades. A

partial list of nations where those deaths have occurred includes Vietnam,

Laos, Cambodia, Nicaragua, El Salvador, Guatemala, East Timor, Sudan, Iraq,

Yugoslavia and Afghanistan.



<p>All in the past? Chomsky rips into the scam of wiping the U.S.

government's slate clean. "If we choose, we can live in a world of

comforting illusion," he said. "Or we can look at recent history, at the

institutional structures that remain essentially unchanged, at the plans

that are being announced -- and answer the questions accordingly. I know of

no reason to suppose that there has been a sudden change in long-standing

motivations or policy goals, apart from tactical adjustments to changing

circumstances."



<p>Chomsky added wryly: "We should also remember that one exalted task of

intellectuals is to proclaim every few years that we have 'changed course,'

the past is behind us and can be forgotten as we march on towards a glorious

future. That is a highly convenient stance, though hardly an admirable or

sensible one."



<p>For those whose window on the world is mostly confined to mainstream

U.S. media, some of Chomsky's statements may seem odd or absolutely wrong.

But you can't make an informed judgment based on a few quotes. Read a couple

of Chomsky's books and decide for yourself.



<p>Noam Chomsky is not a lone ranger or ivory tower intellectual. For

decades, he has worked closely with grassroots activists. "Understanding

doesn't come free," he commented a few years ago. "It's true that the task

is somewhere between awfully difficult and utterly hopeless for an isolated

individual. But it's feasible for anyone who is part of a cooperative

community." And, he added, understanding the world "doesn't help anyone

else, or oneself very much either for that matter, unless it leads to

action."

syndicated column focuses on media and politics.
