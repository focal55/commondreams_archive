<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->To compare Sept. 11, 2001, with Dec. 7, 1941, is to trivialize both dates.

<P>

Both are incredibly important in their own rights, but one is not the other.

<P>

When Japan attacked America in 1941, it forced our involvement in the greatest war ever fought anywhere. In the process, it changed us.

<P>

It's hard to remember what we were like as 1941 approached its end. The Great Depression lingered in much of the nation. My family, like all the families in our neighborhood, was poor, even though most of the men had fulltime jobs, and worked six or seven days a week.

<P>

None of the women had jobs, except for Dick Smith's mother. She was an elevator operator. The Smiths were black. Our neighborhood was integrated, though we didn't know the word then. Most of America was segregated.

<P>

I turned 10 in November. I knew nothing of world events. The Japanese, as near as I knew, were a quaint little people on the other side of the world. They were known for cherry blossoms and paper parasols.

<P>

The Japanese seemed to keep busy converting America's tin cans into little toys and trinkets. "Made in Japan" on a product meant, to us, that it was junk.

<P>

There was no television in those days. We listened to the radio.

<P>

On that Sunday in 1941, I heard something for the first time that I heard often during the war, a voice that still sends shivers up my spine. It was a stern-sounding announcer who said, "We interrupt this program to bring you a special news bulletin ..." Throughout the war, those interruptions were always followed by earth-shaking, sometimes terrifying, news.

<P>

The radio networks in 1941 did not have big news staffs. On the Sunday that Pearl Harbor was attacked, the reports we got were fragmented and mostly filled with static. There were no pictures, of course. There were rumors that the Japanese would attack our West Coast, and maybe invade.

<P>

I was scared. As the day wore on, as we huddled around the radio, it got dark outside. But nobody turned on any lights. Almost 2,000 miles away from the West Coast, I was afraid of an air raid. I don't know if any of the adults shared my fears, but it was pitch dark outside before somebody switched our lights on.

<P>

In that sense, Sept. 11 was like Dec. 7.

<P>

The next day, Monday, I stayed home from school, listening to the radio as Congress declared war on Japan and President Roosevelt told us that Dec. 7, 1941, was "a date which will live in infamy." Congress didn't get around to declaring war on Germany and Italy until Thursday.

<P>

We knew we were in for the fight of our lives. Nobody waved flags. We couldn't afford them. But beyond that, there was no need to advertise our patriotism or our willingness to do what had to be done. That was understood.

<P>

All four of my eligible cousins fought in the war. Three of them came home afterward.

<P>

About one house in three had a service flag in the window, one blue star for each family member in the service, gold stars if they had been killed.

<P>

Our big church had two huge flags, one with a blue star, one with a gold, with numbers underneath. The numbers changed every week, always getting larger.

<P>

The point I am hoping to make with this trip down memory lane is that America was a simpler -- and far more humble -- place then. And the war effort was all out.

<P>

We were not a superpower. The expression had not been invented yet. Germany and Japan were the world powers, and perhaps England.

<P>

American had to build almost from scratch. What we had going for us was an industrial infrastructure and two oceans to buy us time while our allies in England, Russia and China fought off the enemy.

<P>

We won that war, in my opinion, not because of the brilliance of our generals and admirals, and not because of the outstanding courage of our soldiers and sailors, but because we were able to create enough high explosives and delivery systems to blow up everything and everyone that got in our way.

<P>

(This is not to denigrate the heroism of our troops, I hasten to add, but soldiers on all sides fought valiantly. We respected our enemies in those days.)

<P>

Never during World War II did we threaten to bomb anyone into the Stone Age. We did not have that kind of arrogance. We said we would overcome and we would win, but we were humble about it.

<P>

Now we are such a powerful and feared nation that we have created a disastrous refugee situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan without even rattling our sabers. Just the possibility that we might do something violent has sent Afghans running for their lives.

<P>

During World War II, even as we were defeating our enemies, we were making plans to make sure that Germany and Japan would never again threaten the world. How? Not by keeping them weak and dependent but by helping make them strong and proud and self-sufficient. Our effort to help both nations after the war rivaled our efforts to defeat them during the war.

<P>

We didn't teach the Germans and Japanese who was boss. We taught them who their friends were. That, in my opinion, was our greatest achievement. That's what set us apart from other victors in other wars.

<P>

Perhaps we'll have the same wisdom in our extended police action against Middle Eastern terrorists.

<P>

A police action is what it is, not a war. We are fighting loosely knit gangs now, not nations. They can't destroy us as a nation; they can merely hurt us.

<P>

We can, however, destroy ourselves. We can turn America into a police state. We can give up our freedoms in our efforts to gain total security. That is the gravest danger we face today, not the terrorist acts of fanatical hoodlums.

<P>

To my great surprise, President George Bush has so far shown outstanding leadership in our present situation. Granted, he's made a few missteps, he hasn't been perfect, but he's avoided doing anything impulsive and rash, and he's pleaded with us to be mature and patient while the police around the world do their jobs.

<P>

If Bush continues his present course, if he doesn't let the press stampede him into doing anything rash, we can deal with our terrorist problem in relatively short order and get back to normal.

<P>

And that's the big difference between Dec. 7 and Sept. 11. After Pearl Harbor, we had to change to survive. Now we don't. All we have to do now is do our jobs. And be patient.

<P>

What Franklin Roosevelt said about the Great Depression applies now: "The only thing we have to fear is fear itself."
