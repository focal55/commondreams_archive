President Bush prays every day for God's guidance according to media

reports.  Ari Fleischer, the White House Press secretary, recently declared

that  "Mr. Bush believes that energy use is a reflection of the strength of

our economy" and  "the American way of life is a blessed one."  At Tufts

University in Massachusetts, U. N. Secretary General Kofi Annan voiced a

growing global concern that Bush's decision to abandon the Kyoto Protocol on

global warming could severely damage international efforts to curtail

potentially dangerous climate changes that are caused by human activities.

Did God bless the American way of life so we could use 24 % of the world's

energy, create 22% of the world's industrial carbon dioxide, while we make

up only 5% of the world's population?



<p>After pulling the U.S. out of the global warming accord negotiations

involving 180 nations, Bush has declared an "energy crisis" and is pushing

an energy policy that will significantly increase the amount of carbon

dioxide that causes global warming.  His policy calls for burning more

fossil fuels that create carbon dioxide and fails to take immediate steps to

tighten fuel efficiency standards for automobiles although the average fuel

economy for passenger vehicles is the worst it has been in 20 years.  The

plan downplays conservation, which could reduce growth in energy demand an

estimated 20 to 47% according to experts, and renewable energy like solar

and the wind, which will get a token one-tenth of 1% of our energy dollars.

Bush is pushing a short-sighted and false prosperity based on the assumption

that United States' citizens  are somehow ordained by God to have more than

our brothers and sisters throughout the world and that it is okay to steal

from our children and grandchildren and future generations.



<p>Representing our fellow human beings throughout the world, Secretary General

Annan said that a consensus of leading scientists from all nations have

"carefully sifted the evidence and concluded that climate change is

occurring, that human activities are among the main contributing factors and

that we cannot wait any longer to take action."  In the twentieth century

the earth's surface  warmed nearly one and a quarter degrees Fahrenheit and

the ten warmest years ever have occurred in the last fifteen.  In the past

100 years the Alpine glaciers have lost almost 50 % of their ice.



<p>Most climate scientists agree that the rate of warming will continue in this

century and increase at the present rate of global carbon dioxide emissions,

resulting in far reaching ecological stress, rising sea levels , extreme

weather events, and damage to human health.  Many scientists believe these

impacts are already being felt with extreme heat causing massive wildfires

in Florida and drought and crop damage throughout the South.  Guyana has

experienced severe drought, Indonesia devastating fires, and China record

floods.  It is an issue of justice when a Pacific islander discovers that

the rising sea level resulting from profligate energy use in the United

States and the developed world will obliterate her low-lying nation within

decades.



<p>Perhaps the greatest environmental justice issue is inter-generational

theft.  The Eighth Commandment says "Thou shall not steal", but every day

that we live an ecologically unsustainable way of life we steal from our

children and grandchildren.  The energy policy Bush extolls as the blessed

American way of life is unsustainable.  The Great Law of the Iroquois

Confederacy provided that "In our every deliberation, we must consider the

impact of our decisions on the next seven generations."  Today's

money-oriented politicians seem oblivious to any future beyond the next

election.  The oil and gas industry gave a record $32.6 million in

contributions to politics in the last election cycle with 78% of it going to

President Bush's party.



<p>Did "God Bless America" to make a more wasteful and extravagant lifestyle a

national civic religion and destroy other species at an unprecedented rate,

or do we owe our descendants a duty of care?  We must muster the compassion

of the good Samaritan, not only to bandage the wounds of the stranger not of

our tribe, but also to move us to care for our future generations.  When I

look into the eyes of my grandchildren I realize that our greatest

responsibility is to conserve and preserve our exquisite  eco-system for

them and generations to come.
