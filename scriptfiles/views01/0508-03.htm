It had been planned down to the last detail. They would mark up a pitch on the White House lawn, set up stands for the proud parents and invite two teams of youngsters to play a bit of baseball. Even the weather would not be a problem.

<p>But the Bush administration's plan for an unbeatable public relations stunt came a little bit unstuck once the teams ran out to play: one was all-black, the other was all-white, except for one black player.</p>

<p>It had not been planned that the two teams chosen to play the first of an occasional series of &quot;T-ball&quot; games on the lawn should so dramatically illustrate Washington's racial divide. It just appears that no one stopped to think.</p>

<p>&quot;I don't think it's a race issue at all,&quot; insisted Keith Jones, president of the predominantly black Satchel Paige league, from which one of the teams in Sunday's knock-up &#173; the Memphis Red Sox &#173; was drawn.</p>

<p>&quot;Sunday's not about race. Sunday's about baseball,&quot; said Ann Kane, president of the predominantly white Capitol Little League, which provided the other team, the Rockies.</p>

<p>Karen Hughes, Mr Bush's adviser, also tried to play up the inclusive nature of the occasion. She said T-ball, a junior version of baseball, was chosen because of the President's love of the sport. In a previous incarnation, the President managed a Texas baseball team.</p>

<p>&quot;You see that?&quot; said one television cameraman as he looked into his lens. &quot;It's black against white. What's that all about?&quot; Other commentators thought the whole scene resembled something from the Fifties, with black faces lighting up when a black child made a good play, and white faces smiling when a good hit was struck by a white child.</p>

<p>In the end, the Red Sox beat the Rockies 8-5. No date has been set for the rematch &#173; or for any other match.
