Who's afraid of the Big Bad Biotech?

<P>

Increasingly, we are.

<P>

Despite an abiding affection for science and medical breakthroughs, Americans are expressing more concerns about the cutting-edge but often controversial world of biotechnology.

<P>

Critics cite a list of worries once relegated to the world of pulp science fiction: Gene-modified food. Gene-altered animals providing organs for human transplant. Human cloning. Genetic tests used by employers or insurers to discriminate against workers with a predisposition to disease.

<P>

</table></font>Such concerns will be visible today as demonstrators gather for an anti-biotech rally from Balboa Park to Harbor Drive near the San Diego Convention Center. The rally coincides with the opening of Bio2001, the largest annual meeting of the biotechnology industry.

<P>

Biotech supporters dismiss the rally as the work of the sincere but scientifically ill-informed. They also say critics have latched onto a few hot-button issues that obscure the industry's main focus: developing new therapies to treat or cure diseases.

<P>

Still, they concede, the industry is facing an image problem.

<P>

&quot;That's what happens when you introduce a very powerful new technology into a raucous democracy,&quot; said Carl Feldbaum, president of the Biotechnology Industry Organization, sponsor of Bio2001. &quot;The acceleration of the science is enormous and the basic level of science understanding among the public is not.&quot;

<P>

But some scholars say biotech executives would do well to listen to the protesters, because some of their concerns reflect a growing public unease.

<P>

Recent polls suggest that support for biotechnology is undergoing a &quot;substantial and steady erosion,&quot; according to public opinion analyst Susanna Horning Priest, a professor at Texas A&amp;M University.

<P>

A university poll last year found that 53 percent of respondents believed genetic engineering would improve life in the next 20 years, yet 30 percent said it would make things worse.

<P>

&quot;The conventional wisdom that says that genetic engineering is noncontroversial in the United States is difficult to sustain in the light of these figures &#8211; as is the assumption that opposition is limited to the extremist fringe,&quot; Priest wrote in a research paper published last fall in the magazine Nature Biotechnology.

<P>

Most public concerns center on genetic engineering, making new products by turning genes on or off, or moving genes from one animal or plant to another.

<P>

For some time, genetic engineering has been used to create medicines, such as human insulin to treat diabetes.

<P>

But newer research &#8211; for instance, the development of a genetically engineered salmon that grows three times faster than normal &#8211; provokes some environmentalists, ethicists, religious organizations and scientists.

<P>

Biotech advocates acknowledge the social and ethical issues but insist that guidelines can be adopted to balance risks against benefits.

<P>

&quot;It's not like any biotech company is out there trying to create people &#8211; like a sci-fi movie,&quot; said Michael Werner, director of federal government relations for the national industry organization. &quot;We do feel a lot of responsibility to work on these issues, but to do it in a way that is responsible.&quot;

<P>

Biotech opponents say that science, insufficiently regulated and hitched to profit, is a formula for disaster.

<P>

&quot;Genetic engineering represents the most serious, long-term threat to the integrity of life on Earth &#8211; and that has to do with the tremendous manipulative power of the technology,&quot; said Brian Tokar, director of the Vermont-based Institute for Social Ecology.

<P>

&quot;Scientists, and even more so the corporate-types who are further into the development of this technology, refuse to acknowledge a limit to where they want to go.&quot;

<P>

Recent setbacks

<P>

In recent months, fringe scientists and bumbling corporations have provided ample fuel for biotech foes.

<P>

In March, fertility doctors told a U.S. congressional panel that they intend to clone a human being, despite scientific consensus that such experiments are medically and ethically improper.

<P>

Congress also heard from Clonaid, a company linked with a UFO-related cult that claims to be cloning a couple's dead child.

<P>

In February, the federal government brought suit against Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railroad. The company had tested employees for a genetic disorder that causes symptoms similar to those of carpal tunnel syndrome, a disorder caused by repetitive stress to hands and wrists.

<P>

The case is still pending, but in April the company settled a similar union lawsuit. As part of the settlement, Burlington agreed to stop genetic testing and to lobby for federal legislation limiting such tests.

<P>

Perhaps the biggest blunder came last September, when genetically modified corn not approved for human consumption found its way into consumer foods.

<P>

Aventis, the maker of StarLink corn, was forced to recall taco shells and other products because of fears the corn might cause allergic reactions in humans.

<P>

The recall also created costly havoc for farmers whose corn crops had been &quot;polluted&quot; by accidental cross-pollination with the genetic hybrid.

<P>

StarLink and other incidents put the industry on the defensive. Biotech companies, under the umbrella of the Council of Biotechnology Information, have stepped up public relations efforts to try to woo consumers and quell fears. The council is spending tens of millions of dollars on advertisements, including television and magazine spots that extol the benefits of biotech and &quot;genetically enhanced&quot; products.

<P>

Cloning ban

<P>

Meanwhile, biotech companies are pleading their case to Congress. Both the House and Senate are holding hearings on a bill that would ban the cloning of human embryos for any purpose.

<P>

The biotech industry is pushing for a modified version that would allow &quot;therapeutic cloning&quot; of embryos for medical research, including stem-cell cultivation.

<P>

Stem-cell research is also under fire from the Bush administration, which early this year halted federal funding and ordered a review of the issue.

<P>

Meanwhile, groups that include Greenpeace and the Union of Concerned Scientists are drawing their own biotech battle lines, most prominently around the issue of genetically modified foods.

<P>

They are lobbying for a moratorium on gene-altered products, and mandatory labeling of foods with gene-altered ingredients. So far, they have made little headway, but several bills have been proposed or are pending in federal and state legislatures.

<P>

Last year in California, Gov. Gray Davis vetoed a bill that would inform parents about the nutritional value of food served in public schools, including genetically altered foods.

<P>

Davis did approve legislation to create a biotechnology and agriculture task force to evaluate biotechnology risks and opportunities.

<P>

Biotech supporters insist that genetically altered products are safe and adequately regulated. They say anti-biotech activists are scientifically naive or are advancing social or economic agendas that have little to do with science.

<P>

&quot;If there are discussions to be had in regards to safety and risk, those discussions have to be based on science, not on philosophy or emotion &#8211; and that is a lot of what we face now,&quot; said Joseph Panetta, chief executive of BioCom, the San Diego biotech trade organization.

<P>

Industry officials say less than 5 percent of the nation's 1,273 biotech companies are involved in genetically engineered agriculture &#8211; in San Diego County, it's 3 percent. But public worry about gene-altered foods could eventually encompass unrelated genetic engineering research, biotech leaders fear.

<P>

The seeds of a consumer revolt may already be taking root, according to some polls. In a 1999 survey by the International Food Information Council, 75 percent of the respondents said that &quot;biotechnology will provide benefits&quot; for themselves and their families over the next five years. By 2000, however, that figure had dropped to 60 percent.

<P>

Likewise, National Science Foundation figures indicate an increase in people who believe the risks of genetic engineering outweigh benefits. The shift was most noticeable among the more educated. The proportion of college graduates expecting harm to be greater than benefit rose from 20 percent in 1995 to 29 percent in 1999.

<P>

Biotech observers say that an open discussion about biotechnology is necessary if Americans are to embrace its potential.

<P>

&quot;There has been a paradigm shift in how we view ourselves and the world around us, and DNA is the force behind it,&quot; said Philip Reilly, a Boston geneticist and past president of the American Society of Law, Medicine and Ethics. &quot;No one has quite realized the dimensions of the change, and there needs to be a sustained, ongoing public dialogue about it.

<P>

&quot;Biotech is harnessing the technology for good,&quot; Reilly said, &quot;but it doesn't work unless the public buys into it.&quot;
