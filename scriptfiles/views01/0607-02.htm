Back before the dot-com bubble burst, it was

common for otherwise educated people to be

intoxicated with the spirits of a "new economy,"

where the old constraints -- including laws of gravity

-- no longer applied. The vaporization of a few trillion

dollars in the NASDAQ helped to shake a lot of

people out of their stupor.



<p>Now it seems that another defining feature of

the alleged new economy -- "the productivity

revolution" -- may have been as much a mirage as the

wealth of Priceline.com or E-toys at their peak stock

valuation. This week the Labor Department

announced that productivity declined by 1.2 percent

in the first quarter, its sharpest drop in more than

seven years.



<p>Since most people aren't exactly sure what

productivity is or why it is so important, some

explanation: productivity is most commonly

measured as output (of goods or services, for

example) per unit of labor. In English, this means that

if we can produce twice as many shoes with the same

amount of labor time, we have doubled productivity.



<p>Increasing productivity is the main reason,

other than advances in public health and medicine,

that most peoples' standard of living today is higher

than that of their grandparents (notice I didn't say

parents -- back to that in a moment).



<p>For reasons still largely unexplained by

economists, productivity in the US economy grew

much more slowly after 1973 than it did during the

first half of the post-World-War II era. But from

1995-2000, it grew at an annual rate of 2.8 percent, as

compared to an average of 1.4 percent in the previous

two decades.



<p>To believers in the "new economy," this was

the payoff finally arriving from the large investments

that had been made in new technologies, including

computers, software, and the Internet. Most

importantly to investors, this upsurge in productivity -

- and the seemingly enormous potential of the new

technologies to add to this trend -- formed the basis

for the "irrational exuberance" of the stock market. If

the productivity of the high-tech sector was going to

fuel the (much faster) growth of the future, then the

future profits of all these future Microsofts justified

their fantastic stock prices.



<p>Of course, most investors never bothered to

check this new-found faith against some basic

arithmetic.  The latter would have showed them that

even under "new-economy" assumptions about

productivity, the average stock was (and still is)

enormously overpriced.



<p>But the difference between 2.8 versus 1.4

percent productivity growth is still big; it is the

difference between a nation doubling its income per

worker over 25 rather than 50 years. So the question

is: do we have a new economy, based on new forms

of technology and organization, that will generate

higher productivity growth?



<p>Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan

was among those who seemed to accept that we do. In

the last few months, he has noted the continued

growth of productivity during the current slowdown

as evidence for this theory. But the latest numbers tell

a very different story: declining productivity and mass

layoffs are the classic accompaniments of an old-style

economic slowdown.



<p>How, then, to explain the longest

uninterrupted economic expansion in American

history, in the 1990s? There were two new things

about the economy, although neither was

unprecedented. The most obvious was the biggest

speculative stock market bubble since the 1920s,

which fueled the consumption of upper income

households.



<p>The second, and more important change was

the Fed's interest rate policy. Prior to 1996, the Fed

believed that unemployment could not fall below 6

percent without igniting a spiral of inflation. The Fed

would therefore raise interest rates, in order to slow

the economy and increase unemployment, when

unemployment fell below six percent. The Fed's

decision to abandon this theory allowed the

unemployment rate to fall to below 4 percent -- a

level unseen since the 1960s -- and the expansion to

continue beyond the point at which the Fed would

normally have pulled the plug.



<p>But what's really new and different about

today's economy is actually getting kind of old. Over

the past 27 years, the majority of the US labor force

has failed to share in the gains from economic

growth. In other words, the median real wage today is

about the same as it was 27 years ago, despite the fact

that our economy now generates about $34,000 more

income for every person in the labor force.



<p>This would surely be a scandal if the media

were to focus on it, and most people would see our

most urgent economic priority as restoring the

conditions under which a rising tide can lift all boats.

Then we could celebrate the dawn of a "new

economy."
