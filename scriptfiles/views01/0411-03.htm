NO BIRDS ESCAPE President Bush's aviary. No sooner had Christine Todd Whitman said that global warming is one of the world's greatest environmental challenges that Bush clipped her wings. The soaring, sharp-eyed hawk dropped out of the sky.

<P>

<P>She is now a chicken cowering in the distant corners of the White House, ducking the butcher knife being wielded by the same fossil fuel interests that pressured Bush to drop out of the Kyoto accords. Whitman now fully understands that the EPA she runs stands for the Exxon Protection Agency.

<P>

<P>So fast was Whitman grounded that it is clear that Tommy Thompson will be next on the clipping block. Two weeks ago, Surgeon General David Satcher announced that far more women die annually of lung cancer from cigarettes (67,000) than breast cancer (40,800). Since 1980, about 3 million women in the United States have died from smoking-related causes.

<P>

<P>Despite the public relations battering the tobacco industry has taken in the last decade, it spent a record $8.2 billion to market cigarettes in 1999. The industry always claims it does not try to addict children, which of course it must to replace the customers it kills off. It is tragically clear that the slow-motion gas chamber is still in operation. Thirty percent of teenage girls smoke, which represents a rise from a decade ago.

<P>

<P>Thompson, Wisconsin's former governor, had an unBush-like reaction to this, as surprising as Whitman had tried to be on global warming. Thompson said, ''Speaking only for myself, I think tobacco should be regulated.''

<P>

<P>Sounding like presidents of the American Cancer Society and the American Lung Association, Thompson went on to say, ''We're losing our mothers, our grandmothers, our sisters, and wives too soon, directly because they are smoking. It's affecting our families, our businesses, our economy.'' Acknowledging the addictive qualities of cigarettes, Thompson said, ''What starts out as a simple puff is turning into a death sentence.''

<P>

<P>Thompson's passion was also unusual since he had a long history of tobacco ties. As governor, he received $70,000 in campaign contributions from Philip Morris. The tobacco giant does not make cigarettes in Wisconsin, but it is the state's largest private employer as it owns Miller Brewing, Oscar Mayer, and Kraft Foods. Thompson held between $15,000 and $50,000 in Philip Morris stock and traveled abroad on PM's dime.

<P>

<P>Like Whitman, who vowed to defend the environment despite a checkered record as governor of New Jersey, Thompson said he is a reformed man at HHS. Thompson must think he can get away with his mouth because he represents the old boys club. The facts suggest that he is talking his way into a date with the grim clipper.

<P>

<P>Bush gave up smoking, but not smoking money. In the 2000 elections, Big Tobacco gave Republicans $7.1 million in campaign contributions, compared with $1.4 million to Democrats. That is a vast change from 1992, when the Democrats and Republicans received $2.5 million and $3.3 million, respectively.

<P>

<P>Philip Morris was Bush's third-leading corporate donor, giving $1.2 million to Bush's campaign, his Inaugural Fund, and the Republican National Committee. There is no secret what Big Tobacco wants for their money. It wants Bush to drop the Clinton administration's federal lawsuit that says Big Tobacco lied about the effects of smoking to consumers for five decades.

<P>

<P>If that is not enough to assure a direct line to the Oval Office, Bush's chief political adviser, Karl Rove, was a political strategist for Philip Morris from 1991 to 1996. At one point, Rove worked for both Philip Morris and Bush when Bush was governor of Texas. Bush was silent during a lawsuit against Big Tobacco that resulted in a $17 million settlement for Texas. The Bush administration is peppered with so many other officials who have tobacco ties that it seems only a matter of time before Bush will do for Big Tobacco what he did for Big Oil.

<P>

<P>When Thompson was nominated to run Health and Human Services, health activists were angry because of his tobacco ties. Now, he is the best thing the activists have going in the Republican Party. By invoking ''our'' mothers, grandmothers, sisters, and wives, he made tobacco a far more personal issue than Whitman did with global warming and far more difficult for Bush to do Big Tobacco's bidding without being seen as a lieutenant of the slow-motion gas chamber.

<P>

<P>Thompson, despite his tobacco past, has put Bush in an untenable position. Rather than listen to Thompson, expect to watch another hawk drop from the sky. Expect to see another chicken cowering in the corner. No birds must escape the aviary.
