THOUSANDS of abortion-rights supporters will gather again Sunday in 

Washington for a rally and a "March for Women's Lives." A familiar ritual of 

the 1980s and early '90s, such events were not necessary during the Clinton-

Gore years when the pro-choice movement had reliable allies in the White House.

<P>Now, of course, abortion-rights activists have plenty to march about. 

President Bush has appointed the most anti-abortion attorney general in 

history, John Ashcroft. RU-486, the "French abortion pill" that received FDA 

approval only last fall, is threatened with difficult restrictions.

<P>Most worrisome of all, Bush will undoubtedly have the opportunity to 

nominate one or more Supreme Court justices, and one of these may be the vote 

that overturns Roe vs. Wade. The numbers that gather in protest may be even 

greater, and passions higher, if Americans realize that this administration 

opposes not just abortion rights, but a much broader set of reproductive 

services.

<P>The president stunned many last week by presenting a budget that included 

ending contraceptive coverage in the health plans of federal employees. This 

move will affect even more women than the thousands of federal workers 

involved because private insurance companies often take their lead from what 

is covered under the federal health insurance plan.

<P>In an ironic twist, it was this president's father, George H. W. Bush, who 

in 1967, as a congressman from Texas, was a key sponsor of legislation 

establishing the first federal program to make family planning services more 

widely available in the United States.

<P>These two quite different political acts tell us more about how the 

Republican Party's ideological character has changed over 30 years than they 

do about any genuine differences between father and son.

<P>By the 1980s, much of the Republican Party was in thrall to a group of 

religious extremists whose crusade against birth control is nearly as fervent 

as its opposition to abortion. As president, the senior Bush dutifully did 

everything possible to impede access to contraception and abortion, including 

attacks on the family planning program he sponsored.

<P>His son's actions since his first day in office have shown more than an 

hostility to abortion. Bush has embraced the extremists' broad assault on 

reproductive freedom. He started his presidency with an executive order 

reinstating the so-called "global gag rule" -- a policy which forbids the 

federal government from giving family planning money to countries or 

organizations that spend their own funds for abortion services or counseling.

<P>This misguided policy of withholding family planning aid will only increase 

unwanted pregnancies -- and add to the tragic number of 75,000 women who die 

each year in the developing world from illegal abortions.

<P>Bush's moves against both foreign and domestic family planning programs 

will further cement his credentials with his "social conservative" right-wing 

base. For years, this group has viewed contraception as "supportive of the 

abortion mentality," rather than the way most of us see it -- as preventing 

unwanted pregnancies, and hence abortions.

<P>In casting his lot with the extremists on birth control, Bush is buying a 

package that includes the requirement that government support for sex 

education should go exclusively to "abstinence only" programs.

<P>Programs geared toward pregnancy prevention or AIDS prevention are not 

allowed to mention any form of birth control, including condoms, or they lose 

their federal funding. Bush's budget adds millions of dollars to such 

"abstinence only" programs.

<P>Bush's right-wing allies have also done everything possible to deny 

American women information about and access to Emergency Contraception ("the 

morning-after pill"). This drug's ability to prevent pregnancy up to 72 hours 

after unprotected intercourse has long been known by researchers, but to date 

only 1 percent of American women have used it.

<P>If used properly, this pill could prevent as many as half the approximately 

3 million unplanned pregnancies that now occur annually in this country. It 

would thus reduce abortion rates.

<P>Even though health experts insist that Emergency Contraception cannot 

disrupt an established pregnancy, the pill is viewed as an "abortafacient" by 

the right. We can expect administration officials to attempt to block efforts 

by women's health advocates to expand access to the pill.

<P>But in opposing contraception, as well as abortion, Bush may have 

overplayed his hand. While the public is divided on abortion, no such 

ambivalence exists about birth control. Many Americans viewed it as a scandal 

when health insurance plans that did not cover contraception began to cover 

Viagra after its U.S. debut in 1998. The rapid approval by Congress of Viagra 

coverage under the federal health care plan, had -- thanks to the efforts of a 

group of determined congresswomen -- the unintended effect of spurring 

embarrassed legislators to vote for birth control coverage as well.

<P>When mainstream Americans, including many Republicans, encounter the full 

sexual agenda of the right, they find such positions unacceptable -- not to 

mention absurd, given the stated goal of reducing the number of abortions.

<P>Diane DeGette, a pro-choice congresswoman from Denver, speaking of Bush's 

move against contraceptive coverage, said, "If the suburban women who live 

near my district knew this, they would march on Washington." Well, women -- 

and men -- are planning to march on Washington for abortion rights. Their 

banners should also demand the right to birth control coverage for all 

Americans who need it, as well as sensible sex education and access to 

Emergency Contraception. And President Bush will be sent a message he would be 

foolish to ignore.
