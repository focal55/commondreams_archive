My high school didn't have a baseball team, but the local American

Legion post wanted to co-sponsor a team with a local automobile dealer,

so I tried out and made the team. I was the only one who brought a

shoehorn to all the games to help put on my spiked shoes. My parents

brought a pitcher of orange juice.

<p>Every Sunday morning I became a living parody of a Norman Rockwell

painting on the cover of the Saturday Evening Post. I would be wearing my

uniform with the American Legion logo on the front and "Universal

Cars--Sales & Service" on the back, riding my bicycle on my newspaper

route, with my dog Skippy in the basket.

<p>Frank Sinatra became my role model when I was an adolescent and he

made a 10-minute film, "The House I Live In." The lyrics of the title

song inspired my idealism: "All races, all religions, that's America to

me. . . . The right to speak my mind out, that's America to me."

<p>I wanted to be a G-man--an FBI agent--when I grew up. I was such a

patriotic kid. But things change, and I became disillusioned.

<p>In school I had to do a report on a political candidate. I chose Vito

Marcantonio, who was running for mayor of New York. I didn't know

anything about him except that Sinatra was supporting his campaign and

sang at a fund-raiser. Marcantonio was running on the American Federation

of Labor ticket, but my teacher called him a Communist, got very agitated

and phoned my parents.

<p>At home I learned that the Constitution didn't guarantee the

separation of politics and culture. One of my favorite songs, "But Not

For Me," included the phrase, "More clouds of gray than any Russian play

could guarantee," but on the radio I heard an altered version: "More

clouds of gray than any Broadway play could guarantee." The Cold War was

on.

<p>Flash ahead to October 1968. An FBI agent was reading a profile of me

in Life magazine. He sat down at his typewriter, creatively trying to

choose every word so carefully that it would reek of verisimilitude, as

he composed a letter to the editor on plain stationery: "Your recent

issue, which devoted three pages to the aggrandizement of underground

editor Paul Krassner, was too, too much. You must be hard up for

material.

<p>"Am I asking the impossible by requesting that Krassner and his ilk be

left in the sewers where they belong? That a national magazine of your

fine reputation (till now that is) would waste time and effort on the

cuckoo editor of an unimportant, smutty little rag is incomprehensible to

me. Gentlemen, you must be aware that The Realist is nothing more than

blatant obscenity .... To classify Krassner as some sort of 'social

rebel' is far too cute. He's a nut, a raving, unconfined nut ...."

<p>The letter was signed "Howard Rasmussen, Brooklyn College, School of

General Studies." Before mailing the letter to the magazine, "Rasmussen"

was required to send a copy to FBI headquarters in Washington, along with

a memo requesting permission because "the Life article was favorable to

Krassner."

<p>The return memo--approved by J. Edgar Hoover's top two assistants,

Kartha DeLoach and William Sullivan--stated: "Authority is granted to

send [the] letter, signed with a fictitious name .... Krassner is the

editor of The Realist and is one of the moving forces behind the Youth

International Party, commonly known as the Yippies .... This letter

could, if printed by Life, call attention to the unsavory character of

Krassner."

<p>In 1969, the FBI attempt to assassinate my character escalated to a

more literal approach. I discovered this, not in the file kept by

Cointelpro, the FBI's counterintelligence program, but as part of a

separate project calculated to cause rifts between the Jewish and black

communities.

<p>The FBI produced a "WANTED" poster featuring a large swastika. In the

four square spaces of the swastika were photos of Yippie leaders Abbie

Hoffman and Jerry Rubin, SDS leader Mark Rudd and myself. Under the

headline "Lampshades! Lampshades! Lampshades! Lampshades!", the copy

referred to "the only solution to Negro problems in America" as being

"the <i> elimination </i> of the Jews," listed in the following order:

<p>"*All Jews connected with the Establishment. *All Jews connected with

Jews connected with the Establishment. *All Jews connected with those

immediately above. *All Jews except those in the Movement. *All Jews in

the Movement except those who dye their skins black. *All Jews. (Look

out, Abbie, Jerry, Mark and Paul!)"

<p>The flyer was approved, once again, by DeLoach and Sullivan:

"Authority is granted to prepare and distribute on an anonymous basis to

selected individuals and organizations in the New Left the leaflet

submitted. . . . Assure that all necessary precautions are taken to

protect the Bureau as the source of these leaflets [which] suggest

facetiously the elimination of these leaders [to] create further ill

feeling between the New Left and the black nationalist movement . . . ."

<p>And if some overly militant African American had obtained that flyer

and "eliminated" one of those "New Left leaders who are Jewish," the

FBI's bureaucratic behind would be covered: "We <i> said </i> it was a

facetious suggestion, didn't we?"

<p>Now, a few decades later, the FBI is in disarray. And, rather than

censoring song lyrics, the White House Office of National Drug Control

Policy has budgeted $195 million for five years of an anti-drug media

campaign, including $800,000 to the 'N Sync Web site management team,

Music Vision, so that the popular group will instill in youth the notion

that "mind reading, scary movies and hand puppets" are anti-drug

measures. However, mind reading isn't anti-drug; mind control is.

<p>The Vietnam War evolved into the Drug War, and the military-industrial

complex has become the prison-industrial complex. In the United States of

Marketing, patriotism has been replaced by consumerism. Adbusters

magazine is distributing American flags with the 50 stars being replaced

by 50 megacorporate logos.

<p>The paradox of America is that, while the nation seethes with

corruption, we still have the freedom to expose that corruption. It's a

start.
