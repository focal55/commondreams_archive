<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->IF WE GET TOO many more murderers like Robert Lee Massie or Timothy McVeigh, we'll have to rachet up the barbarity of our extermination methods to ensure 

that we continue to receive justice through capital punishment.

<P>That is why We The People execute men and women, isn't it? So "justice" can 

be done? Justice for the victims. For their heartbroken and grieving loved 

ones. For society in general, which so reveres life, and views murder as such 

an abomination that we kill to prove it.

<P>It's about getting even, yes?

<P>Or at least trying to get even. We know that nothing really evens the score; nothing can bring a murder victim back from the dead; nothing can make 

society whole.

<P>So, in the name of justice, we choose two minuses instead of one. We create 

a second set of heartbroken, grieving loved ones. We respond to the 

shortcomings of our culture - the mental illness, drug addiction, pathological 

alienation, rage, ignorance, childhood abuse or DNA - by stopping its heart 

and shutting its mouth, forever.

<P>Which brings us back to Massie and McVeigh.

<P>How can We The People try to get even with killers who want us to execute 

them? How can we exact justice from men who won't fight to the very end to 

stay alive? What satisfaction can possibly be gained from such willing 

participants?

<P>It's not enough that Massie - who was executed at San Quentin Prison on 

Tuesday - and McVeigh - who will die in Indiana on May 16 - waived their right 

to all appeals. They've added insult to injury by rejecting (and deriding) 

outside attempts to spare their lives.

<P>Massie, a two-time killer on Death Row for 30 years, even tried to make it 

easier for prison guards to insert the intravenous needles that would carry 

his chemical ticket to oblivion: He pumped his fist to enlarge his veins.

<P>Massie went exactly as he wanted to go, with exactly the attitude he'd 

carried since his first murder in 1965; he was unremorseful, unapologetic and 

unrepentant.

<P>Where's the justice? Where's the getting even?

<P>The man not only didn't beg for his life, he said dying was far preferable 

to spending the rest of his days in prison. If we really wanted to make his 

worst nightmare come true, we would have refused to kill him.

<P>But then, popular wisdom tells us, we would have robbed his victims' 

families of the one thing they are all after, that elusive reward we call 

"closure." In a country that kills in the name of justice for We The People, 

you apparently can't get closure unless somebody else dies.

<P>Of course, the truth is, closure never really comes - as hundreds of murder 

victims' families will sadly tell you. Their loved ones will never not be dead.

<P>They will never not be heartbroken about it. There is no "normal" to get back 

to.

<P>For a few hours or days, after they watch their son's or mother's or wife's 

murderer die, some people feel better. But later on, when the media no longer 

come to call and there is nothing left to witness, the anger and desire for 

vengeance turn out not to have abated. The instinct is to keep feeding them.

<P>Inside, nothing has changed; there's just the cold, hard reality of what 

has been lost.

<P>If we are to be the only nation in the developed world that equates justice 

with executions - if we insist on perpetuating the myth that a form of state-

sanctioned punishment can fit the crime of a sociopath - then we should put 

down our needles and silent poisons. We should look to the experts, the people 

who don't buy the good news of the New Testament, but resonate to its vengeful 

eye-for-an-eye prologue.

<P>Because we cannot kill a killer more than once (no matter how many lives he 

may have taken), we ought to do the closest thing: kill him as brutally, 

mercilessly and bloodily as we know how.

<P>Our definition of justice demands it.
