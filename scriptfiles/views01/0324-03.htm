It's been two weeks since Ariel Sharon took power and tensions are on the 

rise in Israel-Palestine. The Bush administration has said it wants the 

violence to end. Why then is the US vowing to block the best chance available 

to halt the bloodshed?



<p>This week the UN Security Council again considered the deployment of a 

'protection force' to calm the situation. The proposal draws strong 

international support. But upon Ariel Sharon's request, the US said it would 

veto any such effort. Both the US and Israel have even rejected proposals to 

send unarmed UN 'observers'. This intransigence is in no one's best interest. 



<p>As Sharon visits the White House, repression in the Occupied Territories 

increases. Encircling Palestinian towns with trenches and tanks, Sharon has 

intensified the collective punishment that sparked the uprising in the first 

place. Harsh military lock-downs promise to sow more anger on the Palestinian 

street as students are blocked from their universities, workers from their 

jobs and patients from much needed medical care. Since September, 428 people 

have been killed, seven out of eight of them Palestinian. It's not clear how 

high or how lopsided the death toll will need to be before intervention is 

sanctioned. The time has come for the US to step aside and let the UN do its 

job. 

 

<p>A lasting peace in Israel-Palestine must be based on international law and 

enforced with international oversight. Instead, for seven years the US 

spurned outside involvement, singularly promoting the Oslo process over the 

past seven years. Oslo promised an Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank and 

Gaza, but led to 50,000 new settlers and the bulldozing of 1,000 more 

Palestinian homes. It pledged a sovereign Palestinian state but left all 

infrastructure (electricity, telecommunications, gas, water) in Israeli 

hands. The formula was "land for peace"; the reality was land in pieces. The 

proposed Palestinian state consisted of an archipelago with no free internal 

passage, surrounded by a sea of Israeli settlements, bypass roads and 

military checkpoints. The Palestinians demanded their home back, and Israel 

offered rooms for rent with police stationed in every hallway. 

 

<p>The Israelis want and deserve security. But to get it they must end the 

occupation immediately. Expanding settlements, as Sharon has promised, moves 

in the opposite direction. Each new settler planted in Palestinian territory 

requires Israel to garrison a platoon of soldiers around him, pulling the 

Israeli army further away from its own land. To increase security for all, 

the UN must help implement Israel's withdrawal of both soldiers and settlers 

to the 1967 borders, as mandated by international law.

 

<p>The Israeli government must end the economic inducements for settlers to move 

into the Palestinian territories. These inducements violate UN resolutions as 

well as the Oslo agreements in which Israel agreed to freeze settlements. 

Last year, the Israeli organization Peace Now released a poll indicating that 

53 percent of West Bank settlers had moved to the Occupied Territories for 

"non-ideological" reasons: cheap housing, hilltop views and income tax 

rebates. Nearly 34 percent of the settlers were prepared to evacuate in 

return for reasonable compensation. The UN is well equipped to monitor such a 

withdrawal.

 

<p>But mere observers will not suffice. The UN must deploy a force with a clear 

plan for protecting civilians and ending the occupation. Had the UN sent only 

unarmed observers to East Timor, those massacres would still be occurring. 

Israel is in flagrant violation of international law. With the crime still in 

progress, the UN must dispatch protectors not photographers to the scene. If 

the Bush administration is serious about ending the violence in 

Israel-Palestine, it should stop obstructing the UN from carrying out its 

mission.
