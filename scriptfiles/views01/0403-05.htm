OTTAWA - This is as good a time as any for free-traders to count their toes. With protesters in the streets here and the Quebec Summit of the Americas just weeks away, the friends of globalization continue to shoot themselves in the foot.

<P></P>

Of those self-inflicted wounds, the worst are the failure of the world's largest trading partners to resolve differences over softwood lumber and President George W. Bush's decision to put U.S. interests ahead of international environmental protection. Whatever the merits of those complex and emotional issues, together they fuel the worst fears of those who oppose open borders.

<P></P>

At the epicentre of those fears is the deeply held belief that greed is the god of globalization. In search of profits, sovereignty and the environment will be sacrificed along with democratic institutions, free speech and fair play.

<P></P>

In fact, the great promise of liberalized trade is that it will level the international playing field for developing countries, giving them the economic clout to attack the universal plague of poverty. But realizing the potential of greater international co-operation depends on managing wrenching change by putting broad mutual benefits ahead of narrow self-interest.

<P></P>

So far, self-interest is an easy winner. Ample proof of that unsettling conclusion is found in the escalating softwood lumber war. To protect its domestic forestry industry from what it sees as unfairly subsidized Canadian lumber, Washington is entertaining demands that would severely restrict Canada's second-largest export. While the dispute drags through U.S. courts and eventually international tribunals, Canada faces uncertainty along with the threat that mills will close and up to 10,000 jobs will be lost if punitive duties make this country's products uncompetitive.

<P></P>

Painful as that will be for the lumber industry, the failure to resolve this long-standing disagreement during what amounted to a five-year moratorium will inflict far more serious injuries. It will reinforce the growing sentiment that this country - right or wrong -can't win trade disputes. And it will undermine the fundamental argument that rules-based international agreements protect small economies struggling in the shadow of large neighbours.

<P></P>

Eventually, the merits of the lumber case will be tested, but a few facts are worth considering now. Canada routinely faces charges that it subsidizes the lumber industry by undercharging for trees cut on government land and it routinely wins. The result is that trade is doing exactly what it is supposed to do by generating jobs in one country while in another it protects consumers from unnecessarily high prices.

<P></P>

Those benefits will be lost if an issue that is clearly driven by U.S. economic and political realities, as well as regional differences here, is not resolved quickly. And that is unlikely. Trade Minister Pierre Pettigrew is vowing not to fold while in the U.S., a new administration and the department of commerce are determined to demonstrate their toughness.

<P></P>

If that isn't enough to cast a pall over the Summit of the Americas, the U.S. is handing critics another weapon by abruptly abandoning the Kyoto protocol. Blaming the economic slowdown and promising to put jobs ahead of the environment, Bush announced last week that the U.S. wouldn't ratify the 1997 agreement to substantially reduce the emission of greenhouse gases by 2012. Condemned in Europe as well as by environmentalists here and in the U.S., the decision is seen as irrefutable evidence that globalization is little more than a vehicle for U.S. interests. Bush endorsed that view when he said about Kyoto, "We will not do anything that harms our economy, because first things first are the people who live in America." 

<P></P>

The Kyoto agreement is far from perfect and it would certainly have a profound impact on the U.S, by far the world's largest producer of greenhouse gases as well as the most voracious energy consumer. But Bush could not have chosen a worse moment to espouse the dogma of America First.

<P></P>

Much of the world - and most of the tens of thousands of protesters heading to Quebec - share the conviction that it is folly to hold the global environment hostage to the interests of transnational corporations, or those of the last superpower.

<P></P>

With bumbling bad timing, Bush is delivering the opposite message. Along with the bone-headed Canadian decision to let corporations buy privileged access by sponsoring summit events, the lumber dispute and Washington's troubling disregard for environmental issues are rapidly giving the protest movement more credibility than it deserves.

<P></P>

Consistently and with surprising clumsiness, two of the world's most doctrinaire free traders are building a convincing case against themselves.
