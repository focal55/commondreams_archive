President Bush has declared a "war on

terror," and political leaders such as House

minority leader Dick Gephardt insist that "this is

not a strike against the people of Afghanistan."



         <p>But the evidence is accumulating that our

current military campaign is indeed, as most of

the world sees it, being waged against the Afghan

people.



         <p>Consider this statement from Admiral

Michael Boyce, Chief of the British Defense

Staff. Referring to the bombing campaign, he

said, "The squeeze will carry on until the people

of the country themselves recognize that this is

going to go on until they get the leadership

changed."



         <p>It seems clear from this statement that

Admiral Boyce sees the punishment of Afghan

civilians, including their children, as an important

part of the US/British strategy. On September 16

the New York Times reported that our government

had demanded from Pakistan "the elimination of

truck convoys that provide much of the food and

other supplies to Afghanistan's civilian

population."



         <p>Food shipments fell drastically, although

the border has remained porous, especially to

those who pay bribes. The Taliban is even able to

make money by exporting things as big as logs.



         <p>In recent weeks the UN World Food

Programme has increased its shipments. But these

are still far short of the amount needed to prevent

mass starvation during the winter. The increased

risk to truck drivers, the breakdown in law and

order, and other disruptions due to the war are

taking their expected toll.



         <p>There are currently about 5.3 million

people receiving food aid, and this is expected to

increase to 7.5 million in the near future. In about

two weeks winter will begin, many roads will

become impassible, and people will have to rely

on stockpiled food. Relief groups have called for a

halt in the bombing so that food -- as well as

blankets and medicines -- can get through before

it is too late. But their appeals have so far gone

unheeded.



         <p>And everyone acknowledges that the air

drops of food from US planes are so small that

they are little more than an exercise in public

relations.



         <p>What is terrorism? Edward Herman,

Emeritus Professor from Pennsylvania's Wharton

School of Business, has offered a politically

neutral, straightforward definition of terrorism

that is difficult to argue with: "the use of force or

the threat of force against civilian populations to

achieve political objectives."



  <p>A strategy to "squeeze" Afghanistan,

through bombing and starvation, "until the people

of the country themselves . . . get the leadership

changed" would certainly qualify as terrorism

under this definition.



         <p>Most Americans would like to see Osama

Bin Laden, and anyone else that was responsible

for the atrocity of September 11, brought to

justice. But they would certainly be ashamed if

they knew that their government was pursuing a

strategy that involved starving hundreds of

thousands, and possibly even millions, of innocent

people.



         <p>Of course this is not the first time that our

government has used collective punishment, or

terrorism, in order to achieve its political goals:

there was Nicaragua in the 1980s, Vietnam prior

to that, and many other examples. In fact, by any

objective definition of terrorism -- one that

includes the terrorism of states as well as

individuals --the United States has been its largest

single sponsor over the last half-century.



         <p>This war is different, in that it originated

with a horrific terrorist attack on Americans. But

the collective punishment of the people of

Afghanistan is no more excusable than the crimes

of September 11. As such, it will only inspire

more hatred and terrorism against us.



         <p>There is no military solution to the

problem of terrorism within our borders. We will

have to change our foreign policy, so that our

government does not make so many enemies

throughout the world. Those who collaborated in

the crimes of September 11 will have to be

pursued through legal and political channels,

including the United Nations.



         <p>A good start would be to cut off the major

source of Bin Laden's funding and support, which

is not in Afghanistan but in Saudi Arabia. The

Bush Administration has done very little on this

front, due to a combination of big oil and other

"geopolitical" interests. Our government is willing

to risk American lives, at home and abroad, and

kill any number of innocent Afghanis, but it is

apparently not willing to risk disturbing its

relations with the Saudi royal family.



         <p>Going the legal route won't boost the

President's approval ratings the way a war does,

nor will it make the world fear our military power.

But at least we won't be fighting terrorism with

more terrorism, and fueling an escalating cycle of

violence.
