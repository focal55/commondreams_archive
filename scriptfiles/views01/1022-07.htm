Based on the mail of the past month, a lot of people still want me fired 

from my teaching position at the University of Texas for my antiwar 

writings in the aftermath of Sept. 11.



<p>Many accuse me of being "anti-American," but ironically it is their call to 

limit political debate that is anti-American, for it abandons the core 

commitment of a democracy to the sovereignty of the people and the role of 

citizens in forming public policy.



<p>Some of the folks writing to me -- and to the president of my university -- 

do not mince words: Jensen is not supporting the war effort. So, he should 

be fired.



<p>Other people, perhaps aware that such a call violates any reasonable 

conception of free speech and academic freedom, take a slightly more 

nuanced position: Because Jensen is so political in public, he cannot 

possibly teach in a fair and objective manner (though none of them has ever 

visited my classroom). They reach the same conclusion: He should be fired.



<p>Both arguments are attacks on any meaningful conception of democracy and 

higher education. Let's test the logic of those calling for my firing.



<p>In several essays between Sept. 11 and Oct. 7 (posted at 

<a href="http://www.nowarcollective.com/analysis.htm" target="_new">http://www.nowarcollective.com/analysis.htm</a>), I (along with many others in 

the antiwar movement) argued against military retaliation, on moral and 

practical grounds -- innocent civilians abroad likely will die, making 

future terrorist attacks more likely by deepening the anger and resentment 

against the United States in the Arab and Muslim world. Once the war began, 

I continued to oppose the reckless Bush policy that has created a 

humanitarian disaster in Afghanistan as the war blocks significant food 

distribution and the civilian death toll mounts. Events in the world 

suggest this analysis coming from opponents of the war has been painfully 

accurate.



<p>Throughout, I have suggested that Americans should confront the ugly 

history of U.S. attacks on civilians in such places as Southeast Asia, 

Latin America and the Middle East to understand why so many around the 

world see us not as the defender of freedom but as a violent bully.



<p>If I had supported the president's decisions and endorsed a military 

strike, would anyone have suggested I should be fired? Clearly not; many 

academics have done that without criticism.



<p>Whatever the merits of either the prowar or antiwar position, one thing is 

inescapable: Both are political. So, my correspondents' real objections 

cannot be that I am political, but instead that my political ideas are 

unacceptable to them. That means their actual argument is that in times of 

crisis, certain analysis and ideas are not acceptable and certain views 

should be purged from public universities, which sounds pretty anti-American.



<p>It is of course dangerous to label any idea "anti-American," because the 

term suggests that there can be political positions that are fixed forever. 

But the foundation of the U.S. system is (or should be) an active 

citizenry; being a citizen should mean more than just voting every few 

years. We have the right -- maybe even the obligation -- to involve 

ourselves in the formation of public policy, and in that process no one can 

claim that some proposals cannot be voiced.



<p>If that's true, then those calling for my firing are anti-American to the 

bone; their patriotism is supremely unpatriotic.



<p>In my writing and speaking since Sept. 11, I have not supported terrorism 

or minimized the depth of the pain that Americans feel. I simply have 

suggested that it is important to understand the reasons that terrorists 

were willing to fly jets into buildings. Our president's claim that 

terrorists "hate our freedoms" is embarrassingly simplistic, to the point 

of being childish. It is time to face honestly the way in which U.S. 

foreign policy -- so often cruel, callous and indifferent to the suffering 

of innocent people -- must be understood as part of this story.



<p>Those are political arguments. No matter what one thinks of the soundness 

of the arguments, expressing them is an act of citizenship. In a democracy, 

we do not surrender to leaders the right to make policy undisturbed by the 

people.



<p>If people want to eliminate spirited political discussion from the 

universities, what is left of higher education?



<p>If they want to punish the exercise of citizenship, what is left of democracy?
