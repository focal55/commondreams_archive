Hip-hop and Minister Louis Farrakhan go way back. The expressive voice of

the Nation of Islam's leader has been popping up on hip-hop records since the

genre's formative years. It's always been an odd coupling; the Nation of

Islam's sober asceticism and the hedonistic impulses of hip-hop would seem to

have little in common.

<P>

   Well, they were coupled again at an event titled the "Hip-hop summit:

Taking back responsibility," held June 12--14 in New York City. Organized by

Russell Simmons, co-founder of Def Jam Records, the gathering brought together

artists, record company executives, politicians, activists and scholars to

discuss the state of the music and address its excesses. Among those excesses

is a seeming obsession with vile lyrics that depict gratuitous violence and

other kinds of dysfunctional behavior. And, it seems, when performers are not

rapping about that behavior, they too often are acting it out.

<P>



Farrakhan delivered the event's keynote address and although he chided the

crowd for those excesses, he offered comments that educated rather than

condemned. Farrakhan's two-hour speech captured the attention of the diverse

audience of street-hardened rappers, cynical execs and earnest activists alike

and demonstrated anew why his appeal continues even into his seventh decade.

<P>

   "What society would like to do with the young people is break the mirror

rather than look in the mirror," Farrakhan said, referring to hip-hop's

tendency to reflect rather than refract society's values.

<P>

   The debate about the music's effect on behavior has raged since its

beginnings. Born raggedy on the streets of New York City in the mid-1970s, the

style of music called hip-hop, or rap, has become the third-best-selling

musical genre in the country, behind rhythm and blues and rock. It also has

gained global popularity as a favored music of youth around the world. In the

U.S., hip-hop accounts for 12.9 percent of the $14.3 billion in domestic

sales, according to the Recording Industry Association of America.

<P>

   That success leads some to ask, if hip-hop ain't broke, why fix it?

<P>

   Well, for one thing, Congress is making noises about legislation that could

drastically affect the hip-hop industry's bottom line. A bill proposed by Sen.

Joe Lieberman (D-Conn.), called the "Media and Market Accountability Act,"

threatens to restrict mainstream access to rap music. And there are other

signs of governmental hostility. The Federal Communications Commission

recently fined a station in Colorado Springs, Colo., for playing a record

titled "The Real Slim Shady" by white rapper Marshall "Eminem" Mathers.

<P>

   One of the most important sessions at the summit was a closed-door affair

that focused on political empowerment. Three members of the Congressional

Black Caucus joined prominent intellectuals--including DePaul University's

Michael Eric Dyson--as well as activists and execs to plan how best to fuel

political activity with the power of the music.

<P>

   But aside from thwarting threats from congressional moralists and other rap

opponents, participants in the summit tried to come to grips with the issues

that make rap such a controversial product in the first place. The music is

notorious because it remains rooted in the lives of its creators: urban black

males, America's most feared and criminalized population. Even as it grows in

popularity among white teenagers (whites are estimated to buy 70 percent of

all rap records), a demand for authenticity or "keepin' it real," continuously

refocuses the music on the bleak urban landscapes that produced it.

<P>

   "Gangsta" rap is a subgenre that focuses on life in an underground economy

made possible and profitable by the war on drugs. This devotion to

authenticity can perpetuate stereotypes by giving an unearned centrality to

life on the margins.

<P>

   Unlike many of his peers in the civil-rights and black nationalist

movements, Farrakhan understood the power and gravity of hip-hop.

<P>

   The feeling was mutual; artists ranging the spectrum from gangsta rappers

to "conscious" rappers frequently spoke his praise.

<P>

   Farrakhan's verbal audacity was a perfect fit for the aggressive, "no

sell-out" attitude of rap music. "One rap song from you is worth more than

1,000 of my speeches," he told the crowd at the summit. "You are the new

leadership. Will you accept your responsibility as a leader?"

<P>

   Farrakhan gets a bad rap for many things--some of which may be

deserved--but he's directly on point with his efforts to make hip-hop more

res-ponsible and he deserves credit.
