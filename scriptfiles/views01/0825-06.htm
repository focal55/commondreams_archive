Good riddance to Jesse Helms, one of the most unreconstructed reactionaries on the political stage for the last three decades.
<p>Never one to shrink from playing the race card, Helms opposed the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday and infamously won reelection one time by making a commercial against affirmative action that showed a white person's application being torn up.</p>
<p>When Carol Moseley-Braun, Democrat of Illinois, became the first black woman elected to the U.S. Senate, Helms greeted her with his usual class. Riding in an elevator with her, he started whistling &quot;Dixie.&quot;</p>
<p>A nativist in foreign policy, Helms opposed the U.N. at almost every turn.</p>
<p>He used anti-communism as a cudgel, banging away at Fidel Castro and the Sandinistas.</p>
<p>And he snuggled up to the most rightwing and brutal regimes on the face of the Earth.</p>
<p>&quot;He embraced the vicious system of racial apartheid and its morally repugnant leaders in South Africa and Rhodesia,&quot; Al Hunt wrote in The Wall Street Journal. &quot;He was the leading supporter of an array of South American thugs-Pinochet in Chile, Paraguay's Stroessner, D'Aubuisson in El Salvador, and Cedras in Haiti.&quot;</p>
<p>His was the most distasteful brand of conservatism, rooted in white privilege and the romantication of dictators who favored American business.</p>
<p>So exit stage right, and be gone.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, some of Helms's views will be with us a while longer. His disdain for international agreements, his nativist knownothingism, has taken up residence in the White House.</p>
<p>In time, this policy may come to be seen as backward as Helms's racism, but we're not nearly there yet.</p>
<p>Still, Helms's packing it up is a cause for rejoicing.</p>
<p>There's one less bigot in power.
