Wall Street may have lost its irrational exuberance about the Internet and

its miraculous properties, but I haven't. As a research tool, it's still too

good to be true. My cyberspace connection gives me access to a remarkable

range of publications from many spots on the globe. And while much of the news

content is similar to that found in the U.S., the difference in emphasis is

striking.

<P>

   One of the more salient differences concerns coverage of the Mideast,

particularly the treatment of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. By comparing

other countries' coverage of the turmoil to that of the U.S. media, it's hard

to avoid the conclusion that our media are skewed in Israel's favor.

<P>

Seldom do we read stories like the one published in Israel's Ha'aretz

newspaper that graphically detailed the routine brutality of Israeli soldiers

in occupied territories. Nor are we likely to read accounts of a growing

rebellion of reserve soldiers against Israeli military service in the West

Bank and Gaza Strip that appeared in both England's Daily Telegraph and the

Jerusalem Post.

<P>

   American publications rarely make serious efforts to get beyond the

formulaic coverage that portrays Israel as a beleaguered democracy valiantly

fighting off evil, anti-Semitic terrorists. There is another perspective of

the struggle that casts Palestinians as valiant anti-colonialists fighting a

legitimate struggle against illegal occupation of their land by imperialist

forces.

<P>

   This latter view calls into question the priorities of U.S. foreign policy,

however, and is seldom highlighted in American media. Publications from other,

particularly European, countries provide coverage that is more textured and

contextual--often portraying Palestinians as anti-colonialists.

<P>

   But since U.S. opinion is so critical to Israel's treatment of the

Palestinians, American media's one-dimensional coverage is coming under

increasing criticism. Our relentless pro-Israel slant serves to prolong the

conflict, critics say.

<P>

   Robert Fisk, one of Britain's most highly decorated foreign correspondents,

recently issued a call in the U.S. for more "courageous" media coverage of the

Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Fisk is a Beirut-based writer for the London

Independent and has received the British International Journalist of the Year

award seven times. He has been reporting from a number of the globe's hot

spots for 30 years, but his primary focus has been on the Middle East. He

argues that journalists who fail to note the colonial character of Israel's

illegal occupation improperly frame the conflict and do a disservice to those

who depend on them for accurate information. By ignoring this context, Fisk

contends, journalists are giving sustenance to a system that virtually is

identical to the regime of apartheid South Africa. "There's not much

difference between the tactics of the Israeli army in the occupied territories

and that of the South African police," he wrote in the April 17 edition of the

Independent. "The apartheid regime had death squads, just as Israel has

today."

<P>

   Where, he asks, are the U.S. journalists who will point out these

parallels? Even if the South Africa-Israel analogy is false, there are enough

similarities between the two systems at least to provoke a serious media

discussion of Israel's exclusionist policies. How, for example, can Israel be

"democratic" when it refuses certain rights to its Arab citizens? But, Fisk

laments, "our gutlessness, our refusal to tell the truth, our fear of being

slandered as `anti-Semites' . . . means that we are aiding and abetting

terrible deeds in the Middle East."

<P>

   In their zeal to provide coverage compatible with U.S. policy, the American

media ignore Mideast realities. "No matter how many youths are shot dead by

the Israelis, no matter how many murders--by either side--and no matter how

bloody the reputation of the Israeli prime minister, we are reporting this

terrible conflict as if we supported the South African whites against the

blacks."

<P>

   Syndicated columnist Norman Solomon is one U.S. journalist who concurs with

Fisk's assessment. " . . .The Reporting on the Israeli-Palestinian cycle of

violence is badly skewed by an endless cycle of media bias." Solomon writes

that this bias is enforced through a "not-so-secret weapon" that is brandished

as a pre-emptive threat: the charge of anti-Semitism. "Any Americans who speak

out against Israel's extreme disregard for human rights are liable to be in

the line of fire."

<P>

   The prejudices condemned by Fisk and Solomon are more easily seen from

cyberspace, that remarkable realm where information can sometimes escape the

biased assumptions of its sponsors.
