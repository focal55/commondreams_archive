A native of Egypt, Ali Abdelsoud Mohamed rose to the rank of major in

Egypt's special forces before being forced out of Egypt's military in 1984

because he was considered a religious extremist.  Much later he was

identified as a secret member of the Islamic Jihad movement that

assassinated Egypt's President Sadat in 1981.  According to an amazing front

page story in the Wall Street Journal on November 26 headlined  The

Infiltrator, "Ali Mohamed Served In the U.S. Army - And bin Laden's Inner

Circle," it is implicit that the FBI and the CIA would have had to have

knowledge of Mohamed's chameleon-like lifestyle.  Mohamed was able to obtain

a visa, marry an American woman, become a U.S. citizen, settle in California

and somehow become a U.S. Army sergeant by 1986.  Until 1989, he was a

supply sergeant and lecturer on Mid-east culture at the U.S. Army's special

warfare school at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, a place where he had studied

earlier as an Egyptian officer.



<p>Even though the U.S.. Army and the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency

declined to comment to Journal reporters, Mr. Mohamed's new friends in

California took it for granted that he was working for the CIA in their

proxy war against the Soviets in Afghanistan.  The CIA helped recruit,

organize and finance the mujahedeen in an anti-Soviet Jihad throughout the

Muslim world.  Ali Zaki, a San Jose obstetrician and close friend of Mr.

Mohamed, told the Journal that "Everyone in the community knew he was

working as a liaison between the CIA and the Afghan cause."  Mr. Mohamed

brought Egyptian Islamic Jihad leader Dr. Ayman Zawahri, who is now thought

to be bin Laden's right hand man, with him to California in the early 1990s

on a fund-raising trip, ostensibly for the Kuwaiti Red Crescent.  Mr.

Mohamed was also  deeply involved with a group in New York headed by a

"fiery blind imam," Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman.  They set up the Kitah Refugee

Center in Brooklyn, established to help the mujahedeen in the anti-Soviet

Jihad, but by the 1990s it began turning into an al-Queda front.  The group

was implicated in the assassination of the extremist Rabbi Meir Kahane in

New York as well as the World Trade Center bombing in 1993.



<p>The Wall Street Journal reported that the F.B.I. questioned Mr. Mohamed in

1993 and he told them Mr. Bin Laden was running a group called al-Queda "and

was building an army".  Many of the mujahedeen liberation fighters who

fought with bin Laden in Afghanistan became al-Queda members under bin

Laden's leadership.  It was not until 1998, following the bombings of the

U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, that Mohamed  was arrested.  He pled

guilty to the East African bombings and is awaiting sentencing in federal

prison.  Nabil Sharef, a former Egyptian intelligence officer, told the

Journal, "For five years he was moving back and forth between the U.S. and

Afghanistan.  It's impossible the CIA thought he was going there as a

tourist."  Like Dr. Frankenstein's creation, the CIA's invention of the

marvelous mujahedeen to rid Afghanistan of the Soviets  has turned into the

"evil-doing" al-Queda that attacked America.



<p>The latest news from the war in Afghanistan has a  bitterly ironic, but

interesting, story on the continuum of terror from the mujahedeen to

al-Queda.  Like the Saudi Arabian leader, bin Laden, the mujahedeen were

recruited by the CIA from across the Arab world to fight the Soviets in

Afghanistan in the 1980s.  Many of those same Arabs are now Taliban or

al-Queda, and U.S. Defense Secretary Rumsfeld has proclaimed they cannot

leave Afghanistan alive.  Rumsfeld wants them either killed or made

prisoners, but not allowed to go home to Saudi Arabia or Egypt or wherever

they were recruited  from in the Arab world.



<p>There are news reports of the summary executions by the Northern Alliance of

several hundred prisoners of war including "foreigners" among the Taliban

and more killings of "foreign Arabs" in a controversial "prison revolt" in

the Northern Alliance controlled city of Mazar-e-Sharif.  The U.S.'s Persian

Gulf allies, led by Saudi Arabia, are calling for the repatriation of the

"foreign" fighters.  Saudi Defense Minister Prince Sultan bin Abdul Aziz

told reporters, "We hope that all people who are of Arab or Islamic origin

in Afghanistan can return to their country of origin....  We hope that no

one will be subject to injustice."



<p>Given the miserable human rights record of many elements of the Northern

Alliance who now occupy the Afghan capitol of  Kabul, where they raped,

murdered and pillaged as recently as 1996, human rights advocates have an

overwhelming sense of foreboding about the future of the strife-ridden land.

The Northern Alliance seems to have the upper hand in forming a new

government as  remnants of the Taliban and al-Queda are either destroyed or

dissolve into the caves and barren countryside.  Meanwhile, back in the

laboratories of Washington, D.C., is Dr. Frankenstein concocting another

invention that will extend the continuum of terror???
