MANAGUA, Nicaragua<wbr>--<wbr>As the Senate considers the nomination of John D. Negroponte to be

the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, it is important to look at

charges that, as ambassador to Honduras, Negroponte suppressed

information about the Honduran military's human rights violations. This

is a serious matter. What is the evidence?

<p>According to a 1997 CIA inspector general's report, U.S. officials in

Honduras were aware of serious violations of human rights by the Honduran

military during the 1980s but did not adequately report this to Congress.

A heavily redacted version of the report notes particularly that the U.S.

Embassy suppressed sensitive data during Negroponte's time there.

<p>I am especially concerned about the disappearance of two U.S.

citizens--Father James "Guadalupe" Carney and David Arturo Baez

Cruz--during Negroponte's tenure. Carney had come to Honduras in 1983 as

a chaplain to a revolutionary group, which included Baez Cruz, a

Nicaraguan American who had served in the U.S. special forces. The group

was captured by the Honduran army, and Carney "disappeared" along with

nearly all of the 96 members of the group.

<p>U.S. officials eventually gave Carney's chalice and stole, turned up

by the Honduran army, to his relatives. But the army never explained the

circumstances of the priest's death, suggesting only that he probably

starved in the mountains. Five years later, in 1988, the New York Times

reported that a former officer of the Honduran army said he personally

had interrogated Carney. Carney's body has not been found, and the people

responsible for his death have not been identified. Whether any U.S.

agents or officials were involved in his disappearance remains an open

question.

<p>In a section with repeated references to the capture and execution of

Jose Maria Reyes Mata, the political leader of the group, the CIA

inspector general's report cited a source whose name has been blacked out

who "believes that the embassy country team in Honduras wanted reports on

subjects such as this to be benign to avoid Congress looking over its

shoulders."

<p>Reporting murders, executions and corruption, says the source, would

"reflect negatively on Honduras and not be beneficial in carrying out

U.S. policy." The embassy seemed particularly sensitive to reports about

the operation in which the two U.S. citizens disappeared, the report

said, quoting another source as recalling "a discussion . . . circa 1983

wherein the latter indicated that unspecified individuals at the embassy

did not want information concerning human rights abuses . . . to be

disseminated because it was viewed as an internal Honduran matter." This

is corroborated by an Aug. 19, 1985, handwritten memo declassified by the

State Department: "Fr. Carney case . . . is dead. Front office does not

want the case active. . . . We aren't telling that to the family."

<p>The CIA report cites another person whose name has been deleted as

explaining "the basis for no further reporting on the prisoner

executions--the event had been reported previously and there was concern

on the part of Negroponte that over-emphasis would create an unwarranted

human rights problem for Honduras." Among his conclusions, the CIA

inspector general states: "The ambassador was particularly sensitive

regarding the issue and was concerned that earlier CIA reporting on the

same topic might create a human rights problem for Honduras. Based on the

ambassador's reported concerns, [blacked out] actively discouraged

[blacked out] from following up the information reported by the [blacked

out] source."

<p>It was up to members of Congress to determine whether Honduras had a

human rights problem. But Negroponte denied them the facts needed for

their judgment.
