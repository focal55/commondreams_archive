For 10 days now, we have been flogging Bob Kerrey for what he might

have done in Vietnam 32 years ago. I suggest pausing for a moment to

consider a few other young men from the Vietnam era who, like Kerrey, had

to make their own hard choices: Ron Ridenhour, Hugh Thompson Jr., Norman

Morrison, Muhammad Ali and--most important to me--a man whose name I wish

I could remember.

<p>Late in 1967, Ridenhour was drafted out of college and trained in

Hawaii with a unit that was split up when its members were sent to

Vietnam. Ridenhour went to a light observation helicopter company.

Fifteen of his buddies were assigned to Charlie Company of the 11th

Infantry Brigade.

<p>When they met up again after four months in Vietnam, the men from

Charlie Company unloaded on Ridenhour their guilt about the four hours on

March 16, 1968, the day they had stormed through a village that the U.S.

Army called Pinksville and the Vietnamese called My Lai.

<p>The atrocities at My Lai have been well documented. In their scope and

sadism, they dwarfed even the worst interpretation of what may have

happened at Kerrey's Thanh Phong.

<p>Ridenhour could hardly believe what his friends were confessing.

During their training together, Mike Terry from Utah had impressed

Ridenhour as one of the finest men he had ever met. Now, lying out under

the stars, Terry was telling him about sitting down to his lunch on that

March day and being disturbed by moaning and the flopping of limbs from a

ditch where his lieutenant, William Calley, had lined up and shot unarmed

women and children.

<p>Terry and a friend walked to the ditch and finished the job with their

own rounds of ammunition. That done, they returned to their lunch.

<p>Ridenhour was stunned. "Mike, don't you see that it was wrong?" 'I

don't know, man,." Terry shrugged and then delivered the summation

justification used for every kindred act in the long war:. "It was just

one of those things."

<p>He rolled on his side and went to sleep.

<p>Back home in Phoenix in 1969, Ridenhour was tormented by what he knew.

He felt that if he did nothing, he would be as guilty as the men who

pulled the triggers. He must expose what happened, and yet his family and

friends argued strenuously against that decision. <i>&quot;Why would you

betray your friends, they asked, for people you don't even know?&quot;</i>

Only Ridenhour's high school English teacher, a veteran of the Korean

War, encouraged him.

<p>Ridenhour sent 200 letters to every official he could think of:

President Richard M. Nixon, Secretary of Defense Melvin Laird, Sens. Ted

Kennedy and Barry Goldwater, Gen. William Westmoreland, back from

commanding troops in South Vietnam to serve as Army cChief of sStaff.

<p>Ridenhour's accusations were too horrific and too detailed to ignore.

The Army launched an inquiry, and three years after the massacre, four

men were brought to trial. Only Calley, charged with the premeditated

murder of 22 civilians, was convicted. After Calley spent just three days

in the stockade, Nixon reduced his punishment to house arrest. Calley's

immediate superior, Capt. Ernest Medina, was acquitted but admitted

afterward that he had lied under oath.

<p>Not every American was had been appalled by the revelations from My

Lai. Then, as now, apologists noted the distinctive nature of a war

without traditional front lines, a war in which village women might be

informants for the enemy and a child could grin at an American convoy one

day and lob a grenade the next.

<p>A sympathetic ballad, "The Battle Hymn of Lt. Calley," sold 200,000

records. At Fort Benning, Ga., recruits counted cadence with the chant,

"Calley! Calley! He's our man! If he can't do it, Medina can!"

<p>But the Army's investigation also revealed that several G.II.s in

Calley's platoon had refused to take part in the bloodletting and that

one man on the scene had been a genuine hero.

<p>Hugh Thompson Jr., a 25-year-old warrant officer, was flying a

helicopter over My Lai and saw the carnage beneath him. Landing, he told

his door gunners to train their sights on Calley. If he tried to

interfere as Thompson attempted to rescue a band of cowering Vietnamese,

they were to shoot him. Calley took the warning, and Thompson flew the

villagers to safety, including a 2-year-old spotted by his crew as the

child cried in a ditch beside his murdered mother.

<p>Back at his base, Thompson was told to keep his mouth shut, but he

assisted the Army prosecutors and testified against Calley at his

court-martial. Only a few years ago did the U.S. government recognize

officially the gallantry of Thompson and his two crewmen on that day.

Even then, the Army tried to slip them their medals without a public

ceremony.

<p>Remember also, Norman Morrison, the 32-year-old Quaker who burned

himself to death in November 1965, under Secretary of Defense Robert

McNamara's Pentagon window. Morrison, a husband and father, was

protesting the way Lyndon Johnson had expanded the war in Vietnam.

<p>His suicide reminded the nation that advice from civilians like

McNamara, Dean Rusk and, later, Henry Kissinger, had led to terrorizing

more than just a few villages. They had presided over the ravaging of all

Vietnam, North and South, with B-52 bombings, napalm and Agent Orange.

<p>Eighteen months after Morrison's death, Muhammad Ali was stripped of

his world boxing championship, sentenced to five years in prison and

fined $10,000. He made that sacrifice rather than fight a war he didn't

believe in.

<p>And then came the man whose name I don't know but whose example has

shamed me for 30 years.

<p>As I remember the story from a local news broadcast, a Southern

California man refused to pay his taxes as his form of protest against

the Vietnam War. The IRS had seized his car and other personal property,

and he was headed for prison.

<p><i>&quot;Of course, I thought, with a sinking heart. If you want to

protest and not simply posture, that's what you must do.&quot;</i> I had

written against the war, and friends had marched in antiwar

demonstrations. Those actions made us feel good about ourselves, but, at

the same time, we were paying our taxes, money that helped to keep the

war going.

<p>To be serious and not merely self-satisfied demanded sacrifice--not

self-immolation perhaps, but not evasion and hypocrisy, either. That

realization troubled my conscience. Not enough to act on it, I'm afraid,

but enough to temper a tendency to easy moral judgments about Vietnam.

<p>Now, in the year 2001, we owe it to the villagers dead at Thanh Phong

to try to find out what happened there so long ago. We owe it, too, to

the hundreds of thousands of American servicemen who went to Vietnam and

behaved honorably during their time there.

<p>As for those who argue that many years have passed or that Kerrey's

civilian life has been exemplary, what do they say about Sara Jane Olson?

She is currently on trial in Los Angeles Superior Court for a crime

committed in 1975, while she was a member of the Symbionese Liberation

Army. Do we release her at once? Or do we accept that killing a score of

Vietnamese is a lesser offense than trying unsuccessfully to kill two

officers from the Los Angeles Police Department?

<p>We may never know the truth about Thanh Phong, but we needn't

apologize for seeking it. In the meantime, I'd ask those of us who paid

our federal taxes every year of the Vietnam War to look upon Bob Kerrey's

ordeal with some trace of humility.
