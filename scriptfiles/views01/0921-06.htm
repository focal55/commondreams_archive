The current fight against terrorism poses an unprecedented challenge. To

succeed, the US must overcome the desire for massive military retaliation in

response to the horrific attacks on September 11.  It should adopt a

strategy based on a more accurate understanding of the perpetrators of these

attacks and the roots of anti-American sentiments in the Middle East.



<p>For starters, that means moving far beyond Osama bin Laden. The likely

perpetrators of these murderous attacks are the product of a fringe network

of militants originally recruited by the CIA and Pakistan from around the

Arab and Muslim world in the 1980s during the Soviet war with Afghanistan.

After pulling its support once the Soviet Union left, the US further angered

these militants during the Gulf War when it stationed troops and bases in

the Arabian Peninsula near the holy sites of Mecca and Medina. Consequently,

anti-US bombings began increasing from the 1995 and 1996 car-bombings at US

military installations in Saudi Arabia, to the 1998 bombings of the US

embassies in Kenya and Tanzania and the recent attack on the USS Cole in

Yemen. 

  

<p>Osama bin Laden is not the sole mastermind of these attacks as is often

claimed in the media. He just facilitates these groups with logistics and

finances. His network has no geographical location or fixed center. It

appears to be a kaleidoscopic overlay of cells and links that span the globe

from camps on the Afghan-Pakistan borderlands to immigrant ghettoes in

Europe and the U.S.  



<p>What's more, this network is largely disconnected from most Islamic

opposition groups in the Middle East who are fighting national struggles to

create Islamic states.  What drives their hatred of the US is not Islam but

more political factors.  They believe that Muslims have received the brunt

of international violence over the last decade.  They point to the genocide

against Bosnian Muslims, the Russian war in Chechnya, the conflict between

India and Pakistan over Kashmir, the Israeli occupation of Palestinian

lands, and the UN sanctions against Iraq. In all of these cases, they view

US policies either tacitly condoning the violence or actively supporting it.

  

<p>Therefore, a military strike on militant camps in Afghanistan may kill or

capture bin Laden and a number of his associates but it will not likely

incapacitate the far-flung networks of militants that may have produced the

recent attacks.  They will remain in place, with new reasons to carry out

more terror. Moreover, a massive display of American military might brought

to bear on a Muslim nation, especially one that kills innocent civilians in

the process, is precisely the type of action that these militants hope will

create the conditions for unifying greater numbers of Muslims against the

United States.  It would confirm their view that the US is an arrogant

superpower that cares little about Muslim lives.



<p>A more effective alternative to a military response must combine a massive

international law enforcement effort with a political strategy designed to

isolate and undermine these militant networks. The deliberate and murderous

attacks on innocent American civilians should be characterized and

prosecuted as a crime not a war. The United States must use all its

resources to compel international cooperation to ensure that the

perpetrators have no place to hide. Identifying bin Laden and his network as

criminals who have 

violated international law will make it extremely difficult for countries,

especially those who fear being allied with an American-led war, to refuse

more discrete and effective assistance to the US.  Also, given the disperse

nature of the networks, only international cooperation will work to root

them out.  American declarations of war inhibit rather than promote this

cooperation.

  

<p>This approach must be bolstered by a political strategy that deepens the

isolation of these fringe networks from the vast majority of Arabs and

Muslims, many of whom hold deep and legitimate grievances with US policies

but who do not support violence. In words and deeds, the US must clearly

make a distinction between Islam as a religion and violent extremism.  But

the US must also critically reexamine its policies in the Middle East. 



<p>The US should condemn the serious human rights abuses committed by its

allies with the same force as it condemns other regimes in the region and

condition its aid on progress in opening up closed political systems.  It

should curtail the massive arms transfers to the region and reduce its

military presence, which have done little to promote democracy or stability.

The US must also recognize the failure of the devastating sanctions regime

on Iraq and support legitimate Palestinian aspirations for an independent

state alongside a secure Israel.



<p>Such an approach is not a concession to terrorism but a more realistic and

effective response that is closer to the values that the United States

claims to uphold.
