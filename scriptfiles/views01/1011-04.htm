Continuous television news hypes the "War on Terrorism" like it's a

big ball game we can win if we can only destroy enough of "the enemy" and

their "targets" as we unleash our sophisticated, hi-tech, destroy-and-kill

military machine on one of the poorest countries in the world.  CBS's Mark

Phillips stands on the deck of a U.S. aircraft carrier with cruise missiles

streaking away toward some cave in Afghanistan and enthusiastically quotes a

sailor who says, "We are going to terrorize the terrorists."  Funky

cheerleader hosts like Geraldo Rivera exclaim, "Don't it feel good to hit

back," as his General Electric-owned cable channel boosts the battle for

their defense contracting parent company.  Retired generals and admirals

appear on camera as analysts of the bomb-by-bomb,  play-by-play action.

Beyond the flag-waving and getting-even-  feels-good that keeps the score in

the game of death and destruction dominating television, there are

increasingly sobering stories in newspapers of daunting doomsday danger.



<p>On October 8, the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, John

Negroponte, sent a letter to the U.N. Security Council that claimed the

right under Article 51 to launch military attacks in self-defense and, after

singling out Osama bin Laden's al-Queda and the Taliban regime in

Afghanistan, said, "We may find that our self-defense requires further

actions with respect to other organizations and other states."  U.N.

Secretary General Kofi Annan said he and diplomats in the world body were

"disturbed" by the U.S. statement claiming a right to extend military

attacks beyond Afghanistan.  Negroponte's nomination for U.N. Ambassador was

opposed by human rights advocates because of his support for the murderous

Honduran military and their CIA trained death squads in the Contra War when

he was the U.S. ambassador in Honduras from 1981 to 1985.  On October 10,

the N.Y. Times reported that U.S. officials said terrorists tied to al-Queda

in the Phillippines, Indonesia and Malaysia are among the "likely" targets

of future covert and overt American actions. The Wall Street Journal gave

in-depth coverage to a "simmering debate within the Bush administration over

whether any 'war' on terrorism could be complete without a strike at Iraq."



<p>The N.Y. Times also reported on October 10 that Pakistan's

President, General Musharraf, said he had received "definite assurances"

from the U.S. that the military operation in Afghanistan would be short, but

the White House contradicted him with Bush commenting, "I don't know who

told the Pakistani president that."  In nuclear-armed Pakistan, the N.Y.

Times reported that  military officers close to Musharraf said the U.S.

should not take for granted that Musharraf can indefinitely hold the

loyalties of the army and Washington needed to understand how tenuous

General Musharraf's position might be if the bombings continued, additional

Afghan civilians were killed, and the Islamic protests grew.   As the war

planners expand the conflict, their need for more secrecy grows.



<p>On October 9, President Bush lashed out at members of Congress for

"leaks" of classified information about the war against terrorism.  Bush

received bi-partisan criticism for his "order" limiting Congressional access

to classified information about war making activities and plans.  Senator

Hagel (Rep. Neb.) complained that  "this thing exploded" and Senator Stevens

from Alaska, who is the senior Republican on the Appropriations Committee,

said "I'm not going to vote for money for intelligence matters that I don't

know where it's going to." Senate Majority Leader Daschle said "Congress has

a constitutional role involving oversight."  The secrecy "leak" issue caused

the House Appropriations Committee to cancel a scheduled mark-up of a $369

billion Pentagon spending bill that includes the CIA budget.  According to

the Wall Street Journal, a committee spokesman said, "It won't be

rescheduled until this is fixed."  The greatest threat to democracy in

nation states like ours is government secrecy, particularly  in "national

security" matters. President Eisenhower warned us about  the

military/industrial complex that contrives secret war plans to make

"defense" contractors lots of money and can get a lot of people killed. We

must demand openness in our government and especially the most lethal part

of it.



<p>President Bush's newly appointed head of "Homeland Security," Tom Ridge,

declared this week that "the only turf we should be worried about protecting

is the turf we stand on".  I believe the earth, the-whole-wide-world, is our

homeland and "terrorizing the terrorists" continues the cycle of killing.
