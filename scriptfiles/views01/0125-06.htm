It's that time of the year again, when 3000 members of the global elite

gather for five days at the remote Swiss Alpine resort of Davos, to

schmooze, make deals, and try to put a human face on globalization for the

press.



<p>Funded by more than 1000 of the world's largest corporations, this year's

meeting of CEO's, political leaders, and academics is aware that not

everyone agrees with their basic premises. Among the items for discussion:

"Addressing the Globalization Backlash."



<p>An honest discussion of this topic might begin by asking why globalization

has failed to deliver the goods-- or services. Among economists, it is well

known that the last two decades of rapidly expanding international trade and

investment have coincided with a sharp slowdown in economic growth. From

1960-1980, the average country had real income growth, per person, of 83

percent.  In the last two decades (1980-2000), this growth was only 33

percent.



<p>In other words, despite all the hand wringing at Davos about "the poor

being left behind in the global economy," it is not just the poor who have

lost out. It is the vast majority of people, in the vast majority of

countries-- including the United States, where the median wage (adjusted for

inflation) is about the same today as it was 27 years ago.



<p>Of course most of the poorer countries have been hit harder. In Africa,

real income per person actually fell by 15 percent over the last two decades

(1980-2000), after increasing by 34 percent in the previous twenty years.

And Latin America saw its growth slow from a 75 percent gain in the first

period to only 7 percent in the second.



<p>It is not difficult to see how globalization might have contributed to this

result. In the previous era, national governments exercised more control

over their economic policies. This enabled them, in many cases, to pursue

economic development strategies that increased the productivity of their own

labor force: through investment in industry, education, or necessary

infrastructure such as power and electricity. Over time, this increasing

productivity laid the basis for higher living standards for the entire

population.



<p>The most rapidly growing economies of the last half-century-- countries

like South Korea or China-- had extensive state planning, industrial

policies, and public investment. They did not succeed in raising living

standards by simply opening their domestic markets to foreign trade and

investment-- as low to middle-income countries are now coerced into doing by

the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, and the World Trade

Organization.

<p>The IMF and the World Bank have been especially damaging in this era of

globalization, since they have developed a cartel for credit in much of the

world. This enables them to impose very destructive economic policies in

dozens of countries.



<p>We need look no further than California to see how reckless de-regulation

in areas of vital infrastructure-- in this case electricity-- can damage an

economy. Multiply this by 50, imagine tens of billions of dollars being

drained out of California to a foreign country, and you get an idea of the

kind of economic harm that the IMF and the Bank can inflict on borrowing

countries.



<p>The leaders at Davos would have us believe that the loss of national

economic sovereignty is an inevitable result of the "global economy," and

represents historical progress. But this is not true.



<p>The whole concept of the "global economy" is actually a gross exaggeration.

More than 80 percent of the world's goods and services are produced for

national or local markets. In the United States, the number is 87 percent,

and our government is not constrained by global markets in deciding its

major economic policies. It has, however, used international commercial

agreements such as NAFTA and the WTO to drive down wages here.



<p>It is not global markets themselves, but global institutions such as the

IMF, World Bank, WTO and the corporations represented at Davos that have--

quite deliberately-- curtailed national economic sovereignty in the era of

globalization. We should not be surprised that the result has been poorer

economic performance, since these institutions are not accountable to any

electorate. This is especially true for lower income and transitional

economies that have been most subjected, in this era, to the dictates of

foreign decision-makers.



<p>Meanwhile, ten thousand of globalization's opponents, representing

non-governmental organizations from throughout the world, are meeting at the

World Social Forum in Porto Alegre, Brazil to discuss alternatives to the

Davos agenda. If there is a future for global economic co-operation, this is

where we will find it.
