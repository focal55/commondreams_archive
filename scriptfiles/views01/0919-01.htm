It is distressing that our leaders are addressing the obscene attack on the World Trade Center in New York City and the Pentagon just over a week ago almost exclusively in the language of revenge and reciprocal violence.

<p>

But violence may not be the best means of fighting back. Our best means may be to demonstrate what it means to be civilized. And I think we&#0039;ve begun to do just that.

<p>

Our nation, of course, should prepare for what President Bush called &quot;the first war of the 21st century.&quot; But simply fighting a war against a brutal and nearly invisible army is very likely to be a protracted and costly effort. It will inevitably bring additional destruction, heartache and pain to thousands of men, women and children. If we have learned anything about war up to now, it is that violence alone will not resolve our conflicts. That was the one of the painful lessons of our war against Iraq. 

<p>

Before and beyond violence, we have an equal obligation to try to understand why we were so savagely violated in the first place. What grievance could be so powerful that it leads men in foreign lands to plan their own suicide two or three years in advance - just to murder Americans? &quot;A war of Islam against the West&quot;? Too simple: There is far more to it than that. We have to learn to see ourselves from others&#0039; eyes.

<p>

Before and beyond violence, we must be careful to avoid becoming as vicious in our condemnation of our enemies as their attack was on us. After all, the war against us is aimed not only against America, but also against civilization itself. In hitting us, they strike a blow against cancer research, poverty relief, gender equality, gene research and all the other forms of progress being developed on our shores. 

<p>

And so we must show what it means to be civilized. And we&#0039;re well on the way. The attack has forced us to rediscover our innate decency as a people. American heroes - courageous firefighters, police officers, emergency medical workers, construction crews, and countless volunteers - are working tirelessly in thousands of tons of debris that blanket Lower Manhattan like a gray pall. People throughout the world are heartened to discover that in a time of fear and calamity, many of the stricken could depend on the kindness of strangers. 

<p>

Many Americans are showing an almost casual courage as they work to return to some semblance of sanity. 

<p>

The spirit of war can be healthy, but it can be damaging as well. The truly terrible thing is that it inevitably generates hysteria and rage. It forces us all to think and talk and feel in terms of abstractions that define nothing but inflame everyone. Such language - &quot;lunatic Arabs,&quot; &quot;crazy fundamentalists,&quot; &quot;warmongering Americans&quot; - is a curse against humankind. In our zeal for retribution, we risk forgetting that war means fighting and killing people - men, women and children - not political, religious, geographic or economic abstractions. We risk forgetting that most people in the world are as decent and fearful and confused as we are.

<p>

So let us fight by showing our goodness. Osama bin Laden has become a metaphor for terror. Even if we determine he orchestrated last week&#0039;s attacks, he is not the total of our enemies. As some young Afghanistan boys said in an interview this week: &quot;Kill him and 10 more like him will pop up.&quot; Let us address hatred by showing our best selves.

<p>

By all means, let&#0039;s gird up for the task to come, whatever it is. But I grow nervous when politicians begin shouting only about defending our &quot;honor.&quot; History has taught us when politicians do that, they are preparing for some dishonorable act. But we will win any battle in which we show we love the fact of decency even more than the dream of honor.
