President Bush announced last week that his 2002 budget would include

only a "modest" increase in military spending, in keeping with Clinton's

projected spending of $310 billion. More substantial increases will be

postponed until Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld reviews the needs of

the armed services. The delay is designed to send a "signal of fiscal

discipline," says Bush spokesman Ari Fleisher.



<p>Clearly, this was not the signal right-wing Republicans wanted sent and

they are shifting into overdrive to push for immediate and massive

increases in military spending. The Project for the New American Century

rejects the idea that a Rumsfeld's review is necessary to determine that

"planes are flying for lack of parts, soldiers aren't training for lack

of funds." The group calls on Bush to "increase defense spending,

increase it substantially, and increase it now." 



<p>While Project for the New American Century describes itself as a

"non-profit educational organization," the Board of Directors includes

powerful Republicans, National Missile Defense true believers, and at

least one defense corporation boss. William Kristol, the editor of the

Weekly Standard who served as Vice President Dan Quayle's chief of

staff, chairs the group. Bruce Jackson, Vice President of Lockheed

Martin, the world's largest military corporation, is one of the group's

directors. His firm obviously stands to gain from astronomical increases

in military spending, as a significant portion would go to his company.

Jackson is well connected in Republican circles; he was the finance

chair of the Dole for President campaign in 1996 and a major Bush

supporter in 2000. He was heard to brag at a conference last year that

he would be in a position to "write the Republican platform" on foreign

policy if they took the White House. National Missile Defense enthusiast

and Washington Post columnist Robert Kagan, who described Bush's

decision as his "first broken campaign promise," is also on the board.



<p>If you only listened to the alarmist rhetoric of Kristol, Jackson and

Kagan, you might think Bush was proposing to cut the military budget

drastically. Not so. According to a Council for a Livable World

analysis, Bush's "go slow" budget represents a major increase over

current funding levels. Including Department of Energy military

activities, the total military budget request for next year will be $324

billion, and this is before Congress adds on money for their pet

projects. Congressional "pork" amounted to a $6 billion increase in the

FY 2001 military budget, according to Senator John McCain.



<p>Republicans would like us to think that the military suffered from

malign neglect under President Clinton, but only by using "fuzzy math"

could one possibly draw that conclusion. In dollars adjusted for

inflation the United States is spending more on the military now than in

the mid-1970s, when the Soviet Union and still existed and then

superpower arms race was up and running. This year's defense budget is

more than the next 8 biggest spenders combined and 22 times the combined

military budgets of our fiercest enemies--Libya, North Korea, Cuba, Iraq

and Sudan. The U.S. and its allies account for two thirds of the world's

military expenditures, dwarfing that of rivals Russia and China. 



<p>While conservative ideologues beat the drums for a Pentagon spending

bonanza, rational, moderate scenarios like the one laid out by Lawrence

Korb, former high level official in the Reagan Pentagon, are completely

ignored. Korb argues for a 20% cut in the military budget, comprised

entirely of Cold War behemoths like the B-2 and the Seawolf Sub, that

would free up $62 billion for education, health care and rebuilding

roads and bridges. 



<p>Given the money and power behind the Project for a New American Century

and fellow travelers like the Center for Security Policy, a small but

extremely effective advocate for deployment of an open-ended NMD system,

it is no surprise that Korb's proposals haven't gained a sympathetic ear

in Washington. 



<p>When the Project for a New American Century called for a return to the

"Reaganite policy of military strength and moral clarity," to "increase

defense spending significantly" they gathered a long list of Washington

insiders and power brokers as supporters. While the letter demurred that

such views "may not be fashionable today," a number of the signatures

belong to close friends and advisors of newly inaugurated President

George W. Bush. Vice President Dick Cheney, Secretary of Defense Donald

Rumsfeld, and Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz, as well as the

President's brother Governor Jeb Bush, all put their "John Hancock" on

the letter, making it crystal clear that if it wasn't fashionable

before, it is now.
