I am an Orthodox Jew, and I give much of my charitable money to

Jewish organizations. I do not, however, want the government to start

putting its welfare energies into "faith-based" organizations, even if

that were to benefit the very charities I support.

<p>Why not? First, because faith-based organizations cannot solve

large-scale, ingrained social problems like the lack of decent education

and health care available to the poor. In any case, religious communities

have priorities other than solving social problems. They tend either to

direct their aid primarily to members of their own flock, or to tie it to

a mission of spreading their churches' teachings.

<p>Second, many religious groups accomplish good social ends while

simultaneously promoting doctrines that are morally unsavory and

politically dangerous.

<p>Finally, it is inappropriate for aid to the poor to be given merely

out of compassion. The poor deserve not to be poor. The basic means

necessary to secure equality of opportunity--universal health care, high

quality education and the like--is something the poor are owed by justice

rather than charity. They should neither be forced to feel grateful to

their helpers nor should their helpers congratulate themselves on their

wonderful generosity or compassion. The anonymous procedures of state

organizations are the best way to make sure that equality of opportunity

is seen as a right, not a mere gift.

<p>The man President Bush has chosen to run his experiment with this

faith-based approach, John DiIulio Jr., is a thoughtful and careful

political scientist, and he may find a way of making these charities

complement other welfare programs. But he has a difficult task. The idea

could easily become a baleful distraction, adding little to the struggle

against poverty while strengthening intolerant religions and contributing

to the decline of the notion that justice, not charity, gives us reason

to end poverty.

<p>And that, after all, is not just a secular teaching but a deeply

rooted religious one.
