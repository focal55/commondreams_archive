What do you think of this advice from a senior U.S. military officer and

statesman about how the people of the United States should deal with a

part of the world torn by war, poverty, disease and hunger:



<p>

<blockquote><i>"...it is of vast importance that our people reach some

general understanding of what the complications really are, rather than

react from a passion or a prejudice or an emotion of the moment....It is

virtually impossible at this distance merely by reading, or listening,

or even seeing photographs or motion pictures, to grasp at all the real

significance of the situation. And yet the whole world of the future

hangs on a proper judgment." </i></blockquote>



<p>The speaker was General George C. Marshall, outlining the Marshall Plan

for the very first time in an address at Harvard on June 5, 1947.

Surveying the wrecked economies of Europe, Marshall noted the

"possibilities of disturbances arising as a result of the desperation of

the people concerned." He said that there could be "no political

stability and no assured peace" without economic security, and that U.S.

policy was "directed not against any country or doctrine but against

hunger, poverty, desperation, and chaos."

	

<p>With the Bush administration pulling back from immediate strikes in

retaliation for the September 11 terrorist assaults, the President's

advisers should consider the relevance of Marshall's strategy to the

moral and political problems America now confronts. Of course we should

find the people responsible for the deaths in New York and Washington,

D.C. and bring them to justice, and work with other nations to root out

existing terrorist networks. But we must do so in a way that does not

result in the indiscriminate deaths of even more innocent people, deaths

that would only deepen the cycles of anger and rage. 



<p>What is still missing after the administration's recent public dampening

of its "war on terrorism" rhetoric is almost any recognition of the

underlying problems that have to be addressed, regardless of how

successful we may be in the short run in tracking down the perpetrators

of September 11. As Marshall's words so plainly suggest, finding the

terrorists should be part of a much more ambitious campaign, one in

which the rich countries approach the appalling inequities of the world

with the same boldness and determination that the United States brought

to bear in Europe in 1947 under the Marshall Plan.



<p>We don't really need to spend another dime on "intelligence" to know

what the conditions are that leave whole countries in a state of despair

and misery. Some 1.2 billion people worldwide struggle to survive on $1

day or less. 1.2 billion people lack access to safe drinking water and

2.9 billion have inadequate access to sanitation.  At least 150 million

people are unemployed and 900 million are "underemployed"-contending

with inadequate incomes despite long hours of backbreaking work.  



<p>Globalization has raised expectations, even as modern communications

make the rising inequality between a rich, powerful, and imposing West

and the rest of the world visible to all.  Poverty and deprivation do

not automatically translate into hatred.  But people whose hopes have

worn thin, whose aspirations have been thwarted, and whose discontent is

rising, are far more likely to succumb to the siren song of extremism.

This is particularly true for the swelling ranks

of young people whose prospects for the future are bleak.  Some 34

percent of the developing world's population is under 15 years of age.  



<p>The United States and the other industrial nations should launch a

global Marshall Plan to provide everyone on earth with a decent standard

of living. We can already hear the cries of people claiming that such a

global plan would "cost too much" or "take too long". But let's look at

the numbers. The cost of moving towards "war" has soared into the tens

of billions of dollars, on top of an already large proposed defense

budget of  $342.7 billion. 



<p>For the sake of comparison, let's assume that the United States will

spend $100 billion on the "war" in the next 12 months. What could we buy

if we matched this $100 billion military expenditure dollar-for-dollar

with spending on programs to alleviate human suffering?



<p>A report in 1998 by the United Nations Development Programme estimated

the annual cost to achieve universal access to a number of basic social

services in all developing countries: $9 billion would provide water and

sanitation for all;  $12 billion would cover reproductive health for all

women;  $13 billion would give every person on earth basic health and

nutrition; and $6 billion would provide basic education for all.  



<p>These sums are substantial, but they are still only a fraction of the

tens of billions of dollars we're likely to spend on the "war." And

these social and health expenditures pale in comparison with what is

being spent on the military by all nations-some $780 billion each year.



<p>Social investments can also produce quick results. Development does not

happen overnight, of course, but the World Health Organization and

UNICEF have shown that some critical health issues can be turned around

rapidly.  In the 1990s, the WHO assembled a coalition of 47 countries in

a program to iodize salt, cutting in half the share of people at risk of

iodine deficiency-in just three years.  Concerted government action

recently reduced cases of malaria in Viet Nam by 60 percent in just five

years, and by more than 50 percent in Azerbaijan in three years.  



<p>There is a bitter irony in watching the Bush administration's feverish

efforts to build a "war" coalition.  There was no such effort, not in

the United States nor in any of the other rich nations, to build a

coalition to eradicate hunger, to immunize all children, to provide

clean water, to eradicate infectious disease, to provide adequate jobs,

to combat illiteracy, to build decent housing.



<p>The cost of failing to advance human security and to eliminate the

fertile ground upon which terrorism thrives is already escalating.

Since September 11, we know that sophisticated weapons are no protection

against those who are out to seek vengeance, at any cost, for real and

perceived wrongs. Unless our priorities change, the threat is certain to

keep rising in coming years.



<p>By finally mobilizing adequate resources to address human suffering,

President Bush has a unique opportunity to seize the terrible moment of

September 11 and earn a truly exalted place in human history.  But

first, we must all understand that in the end, weapons alone cannot buy

us a lasting peace in a world of extreme inequality, injustice, and

deprivation for billions of our fellow human beings.
