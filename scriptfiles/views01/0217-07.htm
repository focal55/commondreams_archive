Lawrence Small has a great corporate pedigree.



<p>For 27 years, Small was a top executive with Citicorp/Citibank. In 1991,

he became president of Fannie Mae, the bully on the housing finance

market.



<p>Last year, he became Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution. He didn't

bother resigning from the many corporate boards on which he sits today,

including The Chubb Corp., Marriott International, Fannie Mae and

Citicorp/Citibank.



<p>He's chairman of the financial advisory committee of TransResources

International, the parent company of Haifa Chemical, an Israeli firm.



<p>We ran into Small this week at the Museum of American History. He had

turned over the place to Kmart. Kmart and the Smithsonian had become

"partners" in bringing to the public a traveling mobile museum featuring

a

exhibition titled "Wade in the Water: African-American Sacred Music

Traditions 1871-2001."



<p>The mobile museum is a 48-foot, double expandable trailer, with giant

red

Kmart signs emblazoned on each side. The trailer will travel to Kmart

stores, schools and elsewhere around the nation.



<p>At the auditorium, Small said that he was "delighted to work with Kmart

on

this important project" and thanked the retailing giant for its

"generous

donation."



<p>Brent Willis, Kmart's "chief marketing officer" made some syrupy

statement

about the benefits of diversity.



<p>We wanted to test Willis' corporate rhetoric against the reality at

Kmart.



<p>So we asked Valerie Stokes, Kmart's vice president for human resources,

and the company's highest ranking African-American, how many of the

company's 300,000 employees were African American. Stokes said she

didn't

know. What about a ballpark number? Couldn't tell you. Are any of

Kmart's

more than 2,100 stores unionized? No. Have there been attempts to

unionize? Couldn't tell you.



<p>We asked Small how much money Kmart kicked in to fund the project.

"Don't

know, you'll have to ask Kmart," Small said. We asked the numerous Kmart

spokespeople at the event. Don't know. Can't tell you.



<p>We asked Small why he was turning over the Smithsonian to Kmart, a

company

with a poor reputation in America, in a corporate public relations

effort

to burnish its image?



<p>"It's not being used for corporate public relations," Small said.



<p>Then, in the very next breath, he asked, "Why shouldn't they get

something

out of it? They put up the money for it."



<p>Well, we wanted to know, is it okay for the Smithsonian, which gets

two-thirds of its budget from the federal taxpayers, to partner with

major

American corporations?



<p>At this point, David Umansky, the Smithsonian's director of

communications, cuts in.



<p>"I want you to understand something," Umansky says. "The Smithsonian is

not a government institution. Write this down. Legislation was passed

establishing the Smithsonian Institution as a trust instrumentality of

the

United States -- not the United States government -- but the United

States. It is not a part of the executive branch, it is not a part of

the

legislative branch, it is not a part of the judiciary. It is a separate

entity."



<p>Got that kids? The Smithsonian gets hundreds of millions of dollars from

you and me, and they are before Congress begging for more taxpayer money

-- and it is not a part of the government.



<p>Umansky wants to know: "Why are you so suspicious?"



<p>Well, there should be a stark dividing line between public and private

institutions in America.



<p>You seem to be the only person in America who believes that, he says.



<p>That would come as a surprise to our readers. We have gotten hundreds of

responses from readers who are unhappy with corporate control of public

institutions, including when we wrote a couple of years ago about the

oil

companies taking over a part of the Smithsonian for their exhibit on the

Alaska oil pipeline.



<p>You can get hundreds of people upset about the sunrise, Umansky

counters.



<p>So, any public institution should be allowed to take private corporate

money?



<p>If it's used properly, absolutely, Umansky says. For the Smithsonian,

there is no problem.



<p>It's been 20 minutes now, and we still haven't gotten an answer to how

much Kmart spent for this little public relations stunt. Umansky doesn't

like the persistence. "Why are you being such an asshole?" he asks.



<p>Finally, Umansky gets us an answer on the funding -- Kmart put up $2

million in cash and in kind -- about $500,000 in cash.



<p>At a press conference at the National Press Club last year, Small was

asked about undue corporate influence over the operations of the

Smithsonian.



<p>"There is a difference between providing the funding and having an

endorsement or having a commercial relationship with the museum," he

said.

"So, if it's philanthropy, I don't think there's any problem with it."



<p>In this instance, and in many others, the Smithsonian has crossed the

line. By allowing the Kmart logo and the Smithsonian logo to be

emblazoned

all over the press releases, press kits and trailer last week, by giving

Kmart's "chief marketing officer" a stage to spout empty corporate

platitudes, the Smithsonian Institution was putting its seal of approval

on the company.



<p>Every major new exhibit at the Smithsonian over the past couple of years

has been funded by a major American corporation or industry -- the

Alaska

Pipeline exhibit funded by the oil companies, the insect zoo funded by

Orkin,  and on down the line. The place has become a museum of American

corporations.



<p>Earlier this year, an exhibit on the American Presidency, sponsored by

Cisco Systems and Chevy Chase Bank, among others, was deemed so

important

that it had to bump an exhibit on the work of the late folk singer and

anti-corporate rabble rouser Woody Guthrie. The Guthrie exhibit was

scheduled to run through the spring, but got pulled for the one about

the

corporate presidency.



<p>Through Small and his predecessors, the corporate state has overtaken

the

Smithsonian. Congress should take it back for the people.



<p>Congress should demand that as a condition of forking over hundreds of

millions of taxpayers' dollars every year, the Smithsonian should kick

the

corporations out.



<p>It's time to clean house.
