When the New York Times finally printed the name of a 12-year-old 

organization called Rabbis for Human Rights, the mention had to be bought 

-- in a full-page ad expressing support for actions by the group, which is 

"the only Israeli rabbinic association that includes Orthodox, Reform, 

Reconstructionist and Conservative rabbis."



<p>Days before the advertisement appeared on April 8, the executive 

director of Rabbis for Human Rights had been arrested while participating 

in nonviolent civil disobedience against Israeli demolition of houses. 

"Palestinian homes are being systematically bulldozed all over the West 

Bank," said a bulletin from Rabbi Arthur Waskow, director of the Shalom 

Center in Philadelphia. "In this case, there isn't any pretense of 

'security interests' or 'military targets.' The houses destroyed yesterday 

and today belong to ordinary Palestinian citizens whose only crime is the 

wish to have a roof over their heads."



<p>Groups like Rabbis for Human Rights, and Jewish American activists 

like Rabbi Waskow who vocally oppose Israeli policies, get short shrift in 

U.S. news outlets. Meanwhile, the reporting on the Israeli-Palestinian 

cycle of violence is badly skewed by an endless cycle of media bias.



<p>Searching the Nexis database of U.S. media coverage during the 

first 100 days of this year, I found several dozen stories using the 

phrases "Israeli retaliation" or "Israel retaliated." During the same 

period, how many stories used the phrases "Palestinian retaliation" or 

"Palestinians retaliated"? One.



<p>Both sides of the conflict, of course, describe their violence as 

retaliatory. But only one side routinely benefits from having its violent 

moves depicted that way by major American media. The huge disparity in the 

media frame is a measure of the overall slant of news coverage.



<p>To help maintain pressure for a favorable media tilt, supporters 

of Israel have a not-so-secret weapon, brandished most effectively as a 

preemptive threat -- the charge of anti-Semitism. Any Americans who speak 

out against Israel's extreme disregard for human rights are liable to be in 

the line of fire.



<p>Elie Wiesel, a Holocaust survivor and Nobel Prize winner, is a 

reminder that victims of tyranny are capable of later aligning themselves 

with perpetrators of enormous cruelty. In March, he delivered a speech to a 

national conference of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, one of 

Washington's most powerful lobbying groups. Wiesel declared that anyone 

"who uses their Jewishness as a context to attack or condemn Israel -- 

that's something I'm against." And he denounced criticisms of Israel as 

"anti-Semitism in Jewish leftist circles."



<p>Such salvos are warning shots that Joseph McCarthy would have 

understood. To quash debate, just smear, smear, smear.



<p>Instead of trying to refute critiques of Israeli policies, it's 

much easier to equate criticism of Israel with anti-Semitism -- a timeworn 

way of preventing or short-circuiting real debate on the merits of the 

issues. It is absurd and dangerous to claim that bigotry is at the root of 

calls for adherence to basic standards of human rights. But the ongoing 

threat of the "anti-Semitic" label helps to prevent U.S. media coverage 

from getting out of hand.



<p>Last year, I had an interesting experience with one of Florida's 

daily papers, the Palm Beach Post. A reader's letter, published in early 

June, charged that a column I'd written "had an anti-Semitic undertone" 

because it criticized media spin for Israel. Eleven weeks later, on Aug. 

25, the newspaper printed a second letter from the same reader, objecting 

to a column I wrote about Sen. Joseph Lieberman. This time the letter was 

more emphatic and sweeping, though less specific: "I have noticed in some 

of his previous columns, he is apt to express anti-Semitic views."



<p>The Palm Beach Post printed my weekly syndicated column 30 times 

during 2000 -- for the last time on Aug. 19, six days before publication of 

the second letter accusing me of being "anti-Semitic." After that letter 

came off the press, my column never again appeared in the Palm Beach Post. 

When I inquired, the newspaper's opinion-page editor told me: "There was no 

connection."



<p>Whatever the case may be, there's no doubt that journalists 

generally understand critical words about Israel to be hazardous to 

careers. "Rarely since the Second World War has a people been so vilified 

as the Palestinians," comments Robert Fisk, a longtime foreign 

correspondent for the London-based daily Independent. "And rarely has a 

people been so frequently excused and placated as the Israelis."



<p>Fisk is asking his colleagues to search their consciences: "Our 

gutlessness, our refusal to tell the truth, our fear of being slandered as 

'anti-Semites' -- the most loathsome of libels against any journalist -- 

means that we are aiding and abetting terrible deeds in the Middle East."



<p>Anti-Semitism is a reality in the world. Like all forms of 

religious and racial bigotry, it should be unequivocally opposed. The 

effectiveness of such opposition is undermined by those who cry wolf, using 

charges of anti-Semitism as a weapon in a propaganda arsenal to defend 

Israel's indefensible crimes against Palestinian people.
