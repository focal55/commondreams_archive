If a progressive revival takes place in this country, historians

will look back at the political breakthroughs that occurred in Los

Angeles in the first years of the 21st century as harbingers of that

change. For it is in Los Angeles, with its economic disparities, its

ethnically diverse population and its sprawling geography, that

progressive politics are making more headway than in any other U.S. city.

<p>In many ways, L.A. resembles New York City at the turn of the previous

century. New York was plagued by poverty, slums, child labor, epidemics,

sweatshops and ethnic conflict. Out of this turmoil, activists forged a

coalition of immigrants, unionists, middle-class suffragists and

upper-class philanthropists. While speaking many languages, this

"progressive" movement found its voice through organizers, clergy and

sympathetic politicians. Its victories helped provide the intellectual

and policy foundations of such landmark New Deal reforms as Social

Security and the Wagner Act.

<p>Comparable political forces are converging in L.A. today. By June 6,

following the first citywide election affected by term limits, we will

have a new mayor, a new city attorney and a half-dozen new members of the

City Council. Although the dialogue among the candidates so far may not

reflect a major political sea change, change is coming.

<p>Consider the housing issue. In recent months, leaders of the Sierra

Club, several major labor unions, churches, immigrant-services groups,

community organizations, senior-citizen groups, nonprofit developers and

tenant groups have been meeting regularly to devise a strategy to make

Los Angeles' severe housing shortage a central political issue.

<p>Or take jobs and the environment. A series of meetings organized by

the Progressive Los Angeles Network (PLAN) has brought labor unions,

environmentalists and neighborhood organizations together to craft a

common agenda for creating decent paying jobs that reduce or eliminate

hazards to workers, the community and the environment. Some of the

tensions among these groups are still palpable and have created conflict

over specific projects. But the PLAN meetings are laying the groundwork

for what may constitute a new vision of a livable city and a politics

that can overcome years of mistrust.

<p>This political shift results from painstaking organizing by a new

generation of grass-roots leaders. They recognize that coalitions are

necessary to address the city's problems and that a new politics--and

vision--for the city are not only possible but essential.

<p>The different advocacy groups have begun to recognize that they need

to identify a clear alternative agenda, backed up with a winning

political strategy. It has happened before. Several years ago, a

coalition of labor, clergy and community groups scored an impressive

victory over most of the business community with the "living wage" law.

Now, almost every elected official in the city supports the idea. During

the janitors' strike last spring, even Mayor Richard Riordan, who had

opposed the living-wage ordinance, told the city's building owners they

should pay their workers a living wage.

<p>Since then, leaders of a wide spectrum of organizations and

constituencies have been building bridges. For example, a number of local

unions have become a solid institutional base for organizing, research

and coalition-building, allying with community and advocacy groups to

wage innovative organizing campaigns among health-care workers, janitors,

public employers and others.

<p>In addition, new networks of community organizations have established

a presence in Los Angeles, mobilizing a broad constituency of poor and

middle-class people across the racial divide, focusing on housing, parks,

schools, health care and food. A number of environmental groups have

linked up with parent and community organizations to challenge the

widespread presence of polluters in low-income neighborhoods, such as

school buses that run on diesel fuel, which affects the health of

schoolchildren as well as surrounding communities.

<p>Single-issue go-it-alone politics can win occasional victories. But

addressing Los Angeles' widening economic divide requires more than

short-term coalitions of convenience. It demands a broader vision: a

common view of Los Angeles' future and a common policy agenda. It also

requires constituencies that rarely joined forces in the past to find

ways to work together politically.

<p>L.A.'s progressive mosaic is starting to find its voice. It is

learning to say living wage, social justice and a livable city in

English, Korean, Spanish, Vietnamese and other languages. Its leaders are

developing trust and finding common ground. Whether it can translate its

voice into a powerful movement with political staying power is still to

be seen. But for the first time in years, progressives are optimistic.
