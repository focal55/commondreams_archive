Tension can be addictive.

<P></P>

Fear of free trade may have brought protesters to the streets in Quebec city last weekend, but something else kept them there. 

<P></P>

As inspired by the fence surrounding last weekend's Summit of the Americas as they were angered by it, protesters refused to leave when asked by police. 

<P></P>

They were curious about what would happen next, the tension building as they waited for the police to disperse them, often with tear gas.

<P></P>

Strangely, the gas at times offered some relief from the tension. 

<P></P>

Maybe that's because anticipation is more powerful than action. Maybe it's because of the moments of humanity that followed every volley of gas. Strangers offered water to flush out eyes. Shopkeepers and homeowners did the same, with some even opening their washrooms to protesters. Others blared music from their windows so the protesters could dance to something other than the incessant beating of drums.

<P></P>

In one incident, as I tried to get near the water cannon, I found myself overcome by tear gas and stumbled into a doorway hoping to find a pocket of fresh air. 

<P></P>

Instead, the door swung open and a strong arm grabbed me by the shoulder and dragged me in. A kid in army fatigues whacked me on the forehead with the heel of his palm, pushing my head back and to the side. His thumb forced open my eye. With the other hand, he sprayed a jet of water into my eye. He did the same to my other eye. There wasn't a moment's hesitation. 

<P></P>

Before I could mumble much more than a quick "thank you," he had finished his cigarette, put on his gas mask and was back out the door. 

<P></P>

Late Saturday night, a team of paramedics suddenly showed up at the corner of C&ocirc;te d'Abraham and C&ocirc;te St.-Genevieve and began treating protesters for tear gas out of the back of their ambulance, but had to give up the effort when a gas canister landed nearby.

<P></P>

Everyone on the street those two days had similar stories.

<P></P>

Throughout it all, the protesters were convinced they were winning. Each time the fence came down, it was a victory. Each time a politician inside the fence talked about democracy or human rights, it was a victory.

<P></P>

Victory is what you make it. 

<P></P>

Take the final communiqu&eacute; issued from the summit, which devoted more space to democracy and human rights than trade. For the protesters, that, too, was a victory. 

<P></P>

But the ultimate impact of Quebec will not be limited to democracy clauses or commitments to preserve human rights and the environment. It will be in the unity and organizational skills acquired by the activists.

<P></P>

Organizing the People's Summit and arranging transportation, lodging and food for thousands of protesters from across Canada and the U.S. has taught these young activists organizational skills they will continue to use for years to come. 

<P></P>

To pull it off, they needed all the help they could muster, so they made lasting connections with other activists &#151; connections made stronger by the bonding that comes with experiencing tear gas together and flushing each others' eyes out.

<P></P>

With each protest, the ties among activists have become stronger and the determination to bring about change has grown. 

<P></P>

On the buses home, protesters traded stories of what they saw and experienced, bonding in shared moments that will become part of this country's history.

<P></P>

The attacks on the fence even helped forge bonds between the peaceful activists and the anarchist Black Bloc, resulting in a bit of a rapprochement after the trashing of Seattle left a black eye for many on all demonstrators. 

<P></P>

One sign in the crowd during Saturday's peaceful march read, "God Bless the Kids in Black."

<P></P>

That's because the fence was equally hated by all the protesters, from the most pacifist to the most militant. So when the Black Bloc &#151; likewise showing a higher degree of organization and preparation than was evident in Seattle &#151; tore the fence down, the crowd cheered. Some even helped.

<P></P>

The crowd also cheered every time a Black Bloc member, in gas mask and leather gloves, picked up a tear gas canister and threw it back behind police lines. 

<P></P>

By focusing most of their anger at the fence, the Bloc members rebuilt some of their support among the wider group of protesters. 

<P></P>

There were some acts of violence, but they were shut down quickly by other protesters. 

<P></P>

As well, the Bloc did not seem to be displaying the same randomness of attack that the anarchists had in Seattle. This time, they were focused on the fence, and it defined for them where and how to act.

<P></P>

At the closing day of the People's Summit, a day after Black Bloc members had toppled several sections of the fence, Maude Barlow of the Council of Canadians said reporters had been asking her what she was going to do with these kids who seemed so determined to take direct action.

<P></P>

"The real question is, what the hell is Jean Chr&eacute;tien going to do with these kids?" 

<P></P>

After Quebec, and the lessons learned and the bonds forged by the activists, answering that question could be a lot tougher.
