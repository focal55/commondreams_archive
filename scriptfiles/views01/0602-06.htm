College students sneaking alcohol -- that's a new one on me. When this sort of thing happens in other families, the neighbors say: What were they thinking? Where were the parents? Thank God they weren't driving. When this sort of thing happens in the Bush family, the remarks carry a bit more topspin: Why margaritas? Where were the Secret Service? Thank God dad wasn't driving.

<P>

By now, Camp David probably reverberates with the sounds of George W. Bush impersonating Billy Sunday for the benefit of daughters Jenna and Barbara. He has probably told them of his humiliation. He has likely warned them against further sin. Possibly he has threatened to enroll them at Grove City College.

<P>

I would suggest sending them to college in Kazakhstan, where the drinking age is not enforced and the national beverage is fermented mare's milk. That would solve issues of both supply and demand.

<P>

Or, he could pause, take a long breath -- yes, it's OK to inhale -- and seek the advice of Ruth Engs, Ph.D., an expert on student  drinking patterns.

<P>

Engs has just returned from Rome, where kids join their parents at restaurants, drink wine with their meals, and nobody seems to get drunk because there's no forbidden romance to getting drunk with mom and dad.

<P>

"In most of Europe, it's no big deal. Since it's no big deal, most kids don't go out and get drunk," said Engs, who teaches health science at Indiana University and hasn't gotten drunk since college.

<P>

Sometimes, we pass laws in this country as an excuse not to think. When Jenna and Barbara's granddad was vice president, the White House issued an ultimatum to states: Raise the drinking age to 21 or lose federal highway subsidies. The idea was, of course, to cut down on young people drinking and driving. The result was to further enhance the forbidden allure of alcohol and drive student drinking further into the recesses of dorm rooms, empty fields and private apartments -- precisely the venues in which excess is excused.

<P>

Drinking is last on the list of responsibilities young people are permitted to assume, hence, it holds an appeal matched only by sex.

<P>

"Rather than voting being a sign of maturity in this culture, it's alcohol," Engs said. 

<P>

A sensible approach would be to permit the young to drink only in public places, where the presence of a cross section of society would moderate their conduct. It's pretty certain Jenna and Barbara weren't about to get wide and loud at Chuy's with so many moms, dads and kids there. If there's a videotape of either one drunk, it probably came from a kids-only party in some frat house.

<P>

"It's primarily the private drinking that causes the problem," Engs said. "They were drinking in just the kind of place young people ought to drink."

<P>

It is tempting, of course, to take pleasure in seeing a piece of George W.'s Texas legacy come back at him. He signed the same three-strikes-and-you're-jailed bill that Jenna now risks if this week's citation holds up and she is again caught in the presence of a banana daiquiri. Texas has a reflexive desire to jail people, but the liberal in me suspects this law was aimed less at the patrons of Tex-Mex restaurants than their employees.

<P>

The ruling class of our nation has a long and glorious history of adventures in alcohol. Lyndon Johnson used to tool around his Texas ranch with the steering wheel in one hand and a beer in the other. Richard Nixon got loaded and talked to the paintings. Teddy Kennedy got loaded and the paintings talked to him. I have long suspected political leaders considered Clinton a pervert because he preferred women to alcohol.

<P>

So now we have two college girls trying to score margaritas while the Secret Service agents wait outside. The restaurant manager, perhaps thinking they were trying to buy black market plutonium, dials 911.

<P>

Every few years, reports come out of India about elephants bashing into home breweries, sucking vats of beer down their snouts, then marching drunkenly over the thatched huts.

<P>

For that, you dial 911. For the Bush twins, maybe you call dad and tell him his college students are acting like college students and suggest that it's time for the country to think sensibly about ways to equate maturity and moderation.
