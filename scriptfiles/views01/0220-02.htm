            <p>When talking about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the various 

              perspectives involved, it doesn't take long for intelligent people 

              to start talking like kids about who did what to whom first.<BR>

              <br>

              But life in Israel and the occupied territories is not some John 

              Wayne flick, where the forces of heavenly good are up against pure 

              evil. It's more like a Clint Eastwood western, where moral shades 

              of gray are the norm; the protagonist and antagonist both fighting 

              inner demons, even as they interact with one another.<BR>

              <br>

              Recognize: Aside from divine intervention, the state of Israel is 

              here to stay, at least for the foreseeable future. In talking with 

              hundreds of Palestinians<img align=left hspace=14 vspace=14 src=images/seanlogo.jpg width=94 height=124 border=0> 

              from across the West Bank and Gaza, it's clear to me that they, 

              too, have accepted this reality. Time brings change. After all, 

              60 percent of the Palestinian population now living in the West 

              Bank and Gaza is under the age of 30.<BR>

              <br>

              As I walked around the Old City of Jerusalem, and then in visiting 

              the Wailing Wall, it struck me how wonderful it must feel to be 

              a Jew in a place where you can revel in your Jewishness with the 

              relative security that you won't be expelled or exterminated in 

              mass for just being Jewish.<BR>

              <br>

              The flip side is: Establishing the secular nation-state of Israel 

              has brought with it the displacement of hundreds of thousands of 

              Palestinian natives. And for Palestinians who didn't flee, it has 

              meant 52 years under military occupation by a vastly superior military 

              force. Think Mike Tyson in a fist fight with Elian Gonzales.<BR>

              <br>

              In the city of Hebron, which is in the West Bank, just down the 

              street from where Abraham, Sarah, Isaac and Jacob are buried, is 

              the office and home of the Christian Peacemaker Team - a small group 

              of American and Canadian Mennonites.<BR>

              <br>

              Besides offering counseling services to Palestinians, CPT members 

              patrol the streets, engaging in nonviolent interventions whenever 

              they see some altercation about to erupt between Israeli "settlers" 

              or soldiers and Palestinian villagers - a routine occurrence, most 

              often being committed by the former against the latter. <BR>

              <br>

              Anita Fast, a CPT staff member, told us it is a common occurrence 

              for "the settlers," many of them toting guns on their hips, to harass 

              and intimidate Palestinian villagers by tipping over their vegetable 

              carts in the market, throwing rotten vegetables, spitting or yelling 

              racist insults at them.<BR>

              <br>

              An American lawyer we met a few days later just outside Nazareth 

              commented: "It's like Mississippi 1930 over here. Apartheid. I had 

              no idea it was like this before I came."<BR>

              <br>

              Of the 6.3 million Israelis living in Israel and the occupied territories, 

              195,000 are "settlers," who live in these beautiful "settlements" 

              outside of Israel proper. But the word "settlements" brings to mind 

              some old-Western gold rush village. They're nothing like that - 

              except for the guns.<BR>

              <br>

              Picture one of those private-gated communities you see in suburban 

              America surrounded by several thousand soldiers with guns, tanks, 

              sandbags, U.S.-supplied helicopters and other assorted weaponry. 

              <BR>

              <br>

              The "settlers," Anita explained, verbally and physically attack 

              Palestinians on a regular basis. It usually goes the settlers' way, 

              not because Palestinians are a bunch of Dalai Lamas (although Palestinians 

              are very friendly and hospitable people). It has more to do with 

              the presence of the Israeli Defense Force posted in strategic military 

              outposts along the streets and on rooftops everywhere.<BR>

              <br>

              The IDF completely controls the roads, the air and the sea. So, 

              let's say a "settler" is senselessly killed by a Palestinian gunmen. 

              The typical IDF response is: road closures, trapping Palestinians 

              in their village. A 20-hour, stay-in-your-house curfew is also imposed 

              on every Palestinian in the village. This after the IDF shells an 

              entire neighborhood suspected to be the area from where the gunmen 

              fired. I'm talking tank and helicopter attacks for up to six hours 

              - clearly a campaign not to catch the gunman but to terrorize people 

              whose only crime is that they happen to live in the vicinity and 

              are Palestinian.<BR>

              <br>

              This is known as "collective punishment," meted out because of the 

              desperate violent act of some hope-lost Palestinian, unrelated to 

              the Palestinians being bombed and shot at by IDF forces. Walking 

              up a central street in the old city of Hebron with a Palestinian 

              journalist, we passed by two soldiers standing on the sidewalk next 

              to two teenage Israeli "settlers." Smirks on their face, the "settler" 

              kids gave the newsman the middle-fingered salute and said some nasty 

              things about his father. He said something nasty about their mother.<BR>

              <br>

              "Do you know them," I asked.<BR>

              <br>

              "No, I've never seen them before," he said, shrugging it off as 

              if they were just saying hello to one another. Now I realize: They 

              were saying hello to each other.<BR>

              <br>
