Two toddlers in Cape Town, South Africa, have a lot in common. Okule and Namede live in the same impoverished township. Both of their mothers are HIV-positive.

<P>Yet Okule is HIV-positive, while Namede is HIV-negative. During her pregnancy, Namede's mother had access to AZT, an antiretroviral drug that reduced her chance of passing HIV to her baby by 50 percent.</P>

<P>Okule's mother could not afford this medication.</P>

<P>Four million Africans get infected with AIDS every year. If the current rate of infection is not slowed, the U.S. Census Bureau estimates that by the year 2010, 71 million Africans will die from complications of the disease.</P>

<P>Last week, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said that the fight against this epidemic "requires complete social mobilization in all countries."</P>

<P>In the United States, the social mobilization against AIDS has been taking place in creative and exciting ways. On March 15, the Yale University administration and Bristol-Myers Squibb heeded the call of 600 Yale researchers, students, staff and faculty and the Nobel Peace Prize winning organization Doctors without Borders to allow the generic version of d4T to be sold in South Africa at 3 percent of price of the patented version. </P>

<P>And last week, 127 Harvard University faculty members endorsed economist Jeffrey Sachs' plan to create a "global trust fund" to combat the pandemic.</P>

<P>The University of Minnesota, too, could contribute to this global effort.</P>

<P>In 1987, with the aid of grants from the National Institutes of Health, a "U" researcher invented a compound called carbovir. The University of Minnesota patented carbovir and licensed it to the world's largest pharmaceutical coroporation, GlaxoSmithKline, which developed the drug abacavir (ABC). For three years, Glaxo has been selling ABC under the brand name Ziagen.</P>

<P>Abacavir is an extremely powerful drug that, when taken in combination with other HIV/AIDS treatments, can transform HIV/AIDS from a terminal disease into a chronic one -- like diabetes. Now that we have drugs like ABC, HIV/AIDS need no longer be a death sentence.</P>

<P><SPAN CLASS="subhead">Too few get help   </SPAN></P>

<P>Unfortunately, in the three years since Glaxo began selling Ziagen, its record has been decidedly disappointing.</P>

<P>ABC is one of the HIV/ AIDS medicines that the South African Treatment Action Campaign has targeted as the "source of excessive profits" for Glaxo. Glaxo's profits are generated by monopoly prices -- prices the "U" gave Glaxo the sole right to establish when it gave the company the license to distribute abacavir. </P>

<P>Perhaps this is why Glaxo's own statistics indicate that it has managed to get abacavir to fewer than 10 percent of the people whose lives it is designed to save. </P>

<P>To fail to bring it to 90 percent of the people for whom it is designed is much more than a business failure. It is a human disaster.</P>

<P>As a patentholder, the University of Minnesota has the power to determine to whom and under what terms abacavir is licensed. </P>

<P>This is why international NGOs such as HealthGAP, South Africa's Treatment Action Campaign, and Oxfam America have appealed to the University of Minnesota to help in any way that it can.</P>

<P>These international organizations have asked the "U":</P>

<P>

<LI>To join with GlaxoSmithKline to permit a generic version of its drug to be produced, imported and distributed in developing countries.

<P>

<LI>To persuade GlaxoSmithKline to sell abacavir at cost. Glaxo earned $5.6 billion in profits last year. It can afford to give away what most people with HIV/AIDS can neither afford nor afford to be without: drugs like abacavir.

<P>

<LI>To state publicly that the University of Minnesota is unconditionally opposed to the application of legal pressure (such as the threat of lawsuits) on any government or generic company wishing to make HIV/AIDS treatments accessible at affordable prices.

<P>This would be an important symbolic gesture, at the moment when it's needed most. Thirty-nine of the world's largest pharmaceuticals are suing the South African government to prevent it from doing what its own Constitution allows: to distribute low-cost, generic versions of HIV/AIDS drugs to its own citizens. On April 18, this case resumes. For the university to issue such a statement would be to send a powerful message to the same drug companies that depend on the "U" for its brainpower.</P>

<P>

<LI>To donate the patent for abacavir to a public entity. This would be an unprecedented, historical move. It would set an international example in the fight for affordable, accessible medicines.

<P>

<LI>To commit a portion of its royalties on abacavir sales -- estimated at $30 million a year -- to a "global trust fund." The university has already planned to funnel most of these royalties into further research and development.

<P>The university administration has already stated that it thinks some of these proposals are "impossible."</P>

<P>What is even more impossible is to imagine ourselves 10 years from now, having witnessed 71 million preventable deaths, wondering what we could have done to help.</P>

<P>Either the next generation of children will grow up like Namede, or they will quite possibly never grow up -- like Okule.</P>

<P>There is no middle ground. As Doctors without Borders put it, we find ourselves at a point in history where we can no longer avoid choosing: Either we maintain the rights of patents, or we fight for the rights of patients.</P>
