WHEN the Zapatista National Liberation Army took up arms against Mexico's

one-party dictatorship on New Year's Day, 1994, the ragged army of Maya Indians

made a preposterous pledge to march on Mexico City. Who would have guessed

they'd succeed?

    "We've arrived," the charismatic Subcommander Marcos told the press as he

entered the nation's capital last weekend. "Here we are." They wore their

trademark ski masks but left their rifles at home in their jungle stronghold in

the poor southern state of Chiapas.

<P>

    The fact that a delegation of 24 Zapatista commandantes has arrived at the

center of national power through political mobilization rather than armed

insurrection is a credit to the democratic transition in our neighbor and NAFTA

partner.

<P>

    Ironically, the Zapatistas are increasingly portrayed in our media as a

moribund movement that has fallen short of its dreams, while Mexico's

democratic opening has been successfully exploited by President Vicente Fox and

the free-market right. But the Zapatista uprising did much to prompt that

opening-and Fox, despite his promises to deliver a peace deal, represents a

party that is intransigent on the rebels' demands for greater rights for

Mexico's 10 million Indians.

<P>

    After rallying in the capital's central plaza on Sunday, the Zapatistas

want to address the Mexican congress in a bid to win approval of their peace

plan, which would change the constitution to recognize the "autonomy" of

Mexico's indigenous peoples. They have pledged to remain in the capital until

the accords are approved. Right now, they don't have the votes. The coming

political battle will highlight whether Mexico's new democracy offers anything

other than continued poverty and marginalization for the indigenous peoples.

<P>

    The Zapatistas timed their 1994 uprising to coincide with NAFTA taking

effect and declared the treaty a "death sentence" for Mexico's Indians-who

stand to be forced from their traditional lands by the agro-export owners and

big developers. The 12 days of warfare in Chiapas, which followed the 1994

uprising, forever altered Mexico's political landscape. A large public outcry

called a halt to the government offensive-which largely targeted unarmed Maya

communities-and pressured both sides to negotiate. The talks have lurched

forward in fits and starts since then, with the rebels demanding both

guarantees of Indian rights and democracy for Mexico generally.

<P>

    Before last summer's elections ended the Institutional Revolutionary

Party's rule, Chiapas was poised uneasily between war and peace. Despite

violent provocations, the Zapatistas continued to struggle peacefully. They did

not surrender their weapons and still faced the organized terror of the

PRI-loyalist paramilitary groups,such as Red Mask, which slaughtered 45 unarmed

Zapatista sympathizers at the hamlet of Acteal on Dec. 22, 1997. But in the

court of Mexican public opinion, the Zapatistas are overwhelmingly perceived as

occupying the moral high ground.

<P>

    Vicente Fox, George W. Bush's favorite foreign leader, won election in part

by promising to end the Chiapas conflict "in 15 minutes" and has pledged to

support the peace plan-which the Zapatistas hashed out with congressional

negotiators five years ago. But many in Fox's own right-wing National Action

Party (PAN) bitterly oppose the Maya rebels.

<P>

    Fox is shrewdly tilting away from his own party. But its pro-industry

agenda is inimical to the interests of Indian communities seeking to preserve

their traditional way of life. Even if Fox wins peace with the Zapatistas,

other, more radical armed rebel groups in the south may pick up the ball. And

the Pentagon and CIA have established closer links to the Mexican armed forces

since 1994, mostly under the guise of drug enforcement, and may assume a

growing counterinsurgency role.

<P>

    One of the Mexican army officers who masterminded the strategy of grooming

unaccountable paramilitaries to terrorize Indians back into submission despite

the official truce in Chiapas was Gen. Renan Castillo,graduate of a

"psychological warfare" training program overseen by U.S. Army Green Berets at

Fort Bragg, N.C.

<P>

    The newsmagazine Milenio recently published a leaked report on Chiapas

strategy drawn up by Mexican army brass in preparation for the incoming Fox

administration before his December inauguration. The secret report, "Plan

Chiapas 2000," urged Fox to use the media to portray Subcommander Marcos as a

narco kingpin, thereby creating the proper climate for a military offensive

against the Zapatistas. If the peace initiative fails, Fox may lean toward the

hard-liners.

<P>

    Fox's ambitious "Puebla-Panama Plan" would see a series of inter-oceanic

rail and highway links, oil and hydro development, industrial pods and

free-trade zones stretching from the Mexican state of Puebla to the Panama

Canal. The Zapatistas have decried the plan as a "counterinsurgency" measure

aimed at bringing the restive Indian communities of the Mexican south (and

Central America) under industrial control. If the Zapatistas' peace plan is

approved, the purveyors of such mega-scale projects may face a formidable

obstacle: uncooperative Indian communities with greater political control over

their traditional lands.

<P>

    That's why Fox's own PAN, ensconced in the booming free-trade industrial

elite, has pledged to fight the peace plan. Given this reality, many wonder if

looking to the new president for peace with the Maya rebels isn't letting that

proverbial Fox guard the chicken coop.
