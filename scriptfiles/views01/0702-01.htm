When President Bush meets with the other leading industrial nations

at the G8 conference in Italy in July, weighty topics, including economic

development, trade and Third World debt, will be high on the agenda.

<p>What's equally interesting, however, is the agenda of tens of

thousands of protesters from around the world who are expected to gather

in Genoa. They want to talk about the various ways global corporations

like Monsanto, AOL-Time Warner and McDonald's are undermining cultural

diversity and destroying the viability of local communities.

<p>Protests are becoming a familiar part of world political and economic

forums. But, although the attention often goes to the relatively few

violent protesters, there is a bigger message worth listening to. The

fact is, we are witnessing the first stirrings of a cultural backlash to

globalization whose effects are likely to be significant and

far-reaching.

<p>Local cultures are reawakening everywhere in the world. In India,

consumers recently trashed McDonald's restaurants for violating Hindu

dietary laws. In Germany, there is a heated debate over what is German

culture in the era of globalization. In France, angry farmers uprooted

Monsanto's genetically engineered crops, claiming that they are a threat

to French cultural sovereignty over food production. In Canada, local

communities are fighting to keep out the giant Wal-Mart retail chain for

fear it will replace traditional small-town culture with suburban super

malls.

<p>Globalization is changing the cultural landscape in other fundamental

ways. In Europe, native languages are giving way to English, the language

of globalization, and observers predict an English-speaking continent

from Calais to Moscow by the end of the present century.

<p>The increasing disparity between the "haves" and the "have nots" is

forcing a great human migration from east to west and from south to

north, resulting in a clash of cultures as people wrestle with how to

preserve their cultural identities in an increasingly borderless

commercial world.

<p>The official agenda being readied for the G8 summit makes little

mention of this emerging worldwide cultural activism, and herein lies the

core of the problem. The powers that be have long believed that the world

is divided into two spheres of influence: commerce and government. Now

organizations representing the cultural sphere--the environment, species

preservation, rural life, health, food and cuisine, religion, human

rights, the family, women's issues, ethnic heritage, the arts and other

quality-of-life issues--are pounding on the doors at world economic and

political forums and demanding a place at the table. They represent the

birth of a new "civil society politics" and an antidote to the forces

pushing for globalization.

<p>In the weeks leading up to the G8 conference, we should take a sober

look at the differing ideological visions that lie at the heart of the

impasse between commerce and government on the one hand and the newly

emboldened civil society movement on the other.

<p>The advocates of globalization would argue that free and open trade

and an expansion of commercial relationships and activities of all kinds

are the keys to a brighter future for all. The flaw in this premise lies

in the misguided assumption that commerce spurs culture when, in fact,

the exact opposite is more often the case.

<p>The new cultural activists would argue that there is not an example in

history where people first create commercial relations and then establish

a culture. Commerce and government are secondary, not primary,

institutions. They are derivative of the culture, not the progenitors of

it. People first establish a common language, agreed-upon codes of

behavior and a shared sense of purpose--to wit, social capital. Only when

cultures are well developed is there enough social trust to support

commercial and governmental institutions.

<p>If the G8 leaders are united in their support of global commerce and

trade, the civil society movement groups are just as committed to the

idea of preserving local identity and enriching both biological and

cultural diversity.

<p>Unfortunately, today, the cultural sector exists in a kind of

neocolonial limbo between the market and government sectors. Only by

making local culture a coherent, self-aware political force will it be

possible to reestablish its critical role in the scheme of human society

once again. Indeed, it may be time to establish a World Cultural

Organization to represent diverse cultures around the globe, and give the

"WCO" an equal footing with the WTO (World Trade Organization) in

international affairs.

<p>Some people worry that a resurgent interest in local cultures must

inevitably lead to xenophobia and ultra-nationalist sentiment. That

doesn't have to be so. If people everywhere come to think of their own

cultural resources not as possessions to defend but, rather, as gifts to

exchange with one another, then the great human migrations of the 21st

century could spawn a cultural renaissance and create the conditions for

a truly humane globalization of commerce and trade.

<p>The ability of political leaders to identify with and promote both the

interests of the civil society and cultural diversity will be critical to

ensuring their relevance and viability in the coming century. This was

the lesson being taught by the protesters assembling on the streets of

Seattle 18 months ago. It's a lesson that is likely to repeat itself on

the streets of Genoa in July.

<p>The question is, will the heads of state who assemble in Italy take

the time to listen carefully to the message coming from outside their

windows? If they don't, the escalating frustration is likely to play into

the hands of the growing number of violence-prone extremists, with untold

consequences for the world's future.
