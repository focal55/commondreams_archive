IMAGINE HAVING the impending joy of settling back for a long, 

leisurely ride on a slow-moving train explode with the terror of being jarred 

from your seat by a large, angry-looking man in dark military garb accompanied 

by a mean-looking dog growling viciously at your feet.

<P>The scene only could happen in a totalitarian state, you would assume. 

You'd be wrong. It is occurring in America 2001 -- most specifically, 

Albuquerque, N.M. -- where train passengers are unknowingly being profiled for 

profit.

<P>In Albuquerque, Amtrak has established a disturbingly cozy relationship 

with federal drug agents, offering details about "suspicious" passengers in 

exchange for 10 percent of any cash seized during drug-related arrests. The 

information is directly fed to a computer linked to an Amtrak ticketing 

terminal and sitting on a desk at the local Drug Enforcement Agency office.

<P>The computer -- belonging to an Amtrak investigator who is also a DEA task 

force deputy -- compiles passengers' names, from and to where they're heading 

and, most of all, how they paid. Cash purchases are flagged, with some buyers 

questioned and their luggage checked by the man with the drug-sniffing dog.

<P>It's an outrageous practice, an affront to the very core of personal 

freedoms. It destroys reasonable expectations of personal privacy by forcing 

citizens to prove themselves innocent.

<P>The prospect of unwarranted search and seizure is further compounded by 

issues of race and class: the poor and people of color are accosted the most 

solely because they often use cash.

<P>At any rate, it's dangerous when government agents gather data on citizens 

thiss way.

<P>This practice should stop. And Amtrak, however desperate for passengers, 

ought to be ashamed of its part in it all.
