REMEMBER California's energy crisis? It illustrated the political 

strategy of the Bush administration before September 11. The basic principle 

of this strategy was that crises weren't problems to be solved. Instead, they 

were opportunities to advance an agenda that had nothing to do with the crisis 

at hand.

<P>It is now clear that, at least as far as domestic policy is concerned, the 

administration views terrorism as another useful crisis.

<P>Let's recall the California story. Between November 2000 and June 2001, a 

shortage of electric generating capacity, exacerbated by the puzzling fact 

that much of this capacity stood idle, led to power outages and extremely high 

prices.

<P>The appropriate response was obvious. First, encourage conservation until 

new capacity could be added; second, temporarily cap prices, both to limit the 

financial damage and to discourage power companies from manipulating the 

market.

<P>But Vice President Dick Cheney dismissed conservation as a mere "sign of 

personal virtue," and administration officials waved aside pleas for a price 

ceiling. Instead, they used California's woes to push for large subsidies to 

the coal industry, and, of course, drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife 

Refuge. We never did learn what all this had to do with electricity generation.

<P>Now to the present. After September 11, we need to spend substantial sums 

on reconstruction and homeland security, and the sagging economy could use a 

temporary stimulus. But George W. Bush has threatened to veto any additional 

domestic spending beyond the $40 billion already agreed upon. And the 

administration favors "stimulus" proposals that have nothing to do with 

helping the economy, but everything to do with its usual tax-cutting agenda.

<P>The stimulus package introduced by Senate Democrats isn't perfect, by a 

long shot. But at least $70 billion of its $90 billion is real stimulus, in 

the form of temporary investment incentives, temporary grants of income 

support and medical care to the unemployed, and checks to low-income families 

who are likely to spend them.

<P>The administration, however, favors the Senate Republicans' proposal; while 

that bill is less lurid than the one passed by the House, with its huge 

retroactive tax cuts for big corporations, over all it's just as bad. It would 

cost $220 billion over three years; less than $20 billion of that seems to 

have anything to do with economic stimulus.

<P>The rest of the proposal consists of tax cuts for corporations and high-

income individuals, structured in such a way that they will do little to 

increase spending during the recession.

<P>Why does the administration's favored bill offer so little stimulus? 

Because that's not its purpose: It's really designed to lock in permanent tax 

cuts for corporations and the wealthy, using the September 11 attacks as an 

excuse.

<P>Ten months into the Bush administration, we've all gotten used to this. But 

politics, while never completely clean, didn't used to be this cynical. We 

used to see bills like the Democratic stimulus package: mostly serving their 

ostensible purpose, with the special-interest add-ons a distinctly secondary 

feature. It's something new to see crises -- especially a crisis as shocking 

as the terrorist attack -- consistently addressed with legislation that does 

almost nothing to address the actual problem, and is almost entirely aimed at 

advancing a pre-existing agenda.

<P>Oh, by the way: The administration is once again pushing for drilling in 

the Arctic. You see, it's essential to the fight against terrorism.</p>
