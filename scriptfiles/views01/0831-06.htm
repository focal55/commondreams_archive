In a recent obituary about a former state prison official, the New 
York Times made a passing reference to "the bloody Attica uprising in 1971, 
which left 43 people dead." That's the kind of newspeak that presents 
itself as journalism while detouring around truth.

<p>Thirty years ago, on Sept. 13, in upstate New York, a four-day 
standoff at the Attica Correctional Facility ended when 500 state troopers 
attacked the prison compound, firing 2,200 bullets in nine minutes. The 
raid killed 29 inmates and 10 guards held as hostages, while wounding at 
least 86 other people. The orders came from Gov. Nelson Rockefeller.

<p>Media outlets across the country reported official lies as if they 
were objective facts -- proclaiming that the rebellious prisoners slit the 
throats of the hostages when the troopers began their assault. Autopsies 
later revealed that no throats had been cut; only then did authorities 
admit that the state did the killing.

<p>Now, three decades later, a new full-length documentary, "The 
Ghosts of Attica," is debuting on national television. The film includes 
chilling photos and footage (long withheld from the public by state 
officials) and moving interviews with former prisoners, ex-guards and 
others whose lives were transformed by what occurred during the second week 
of September 1971.

<p>"The Ghosts of Attica" premieres nationwide Sept. 9 on Court TV 
(at 9 p.m. in most time zones). Nuanced and unflinching, the 91-minute film 
packs a powerful wallop because of its deep respect for historical accuracy.

<p>Horrendous prison conditions prompted the Attica uprising, which 
began as an undisciplined riot and grew into a well-focused articulation of 
rage from men who chose to take a fateful step, fighting for human dignity. 
While the uprising was multiracial, most of the 1,281 prisoners involved 
were black.

<p>The documentary film is an indictment of what has so often passed 
for journalism in reporting on prison-related events. Reflexively assuming 
that the powerful white guys in positions of authority would be truthful, 
reporters on the story got it backwards.

<p>While the film avoids a facile good-vs.-evil tone, there are 
heroes nonetheless. Frank "Big Black" Smith, a prisoner who emerged as a 
leader of the uprising, went on to work as a paralegal on the outside. 
Along with attorney Liz Fink, he was a key coordinator of a 26-year civil 
action lawsuit brought by Attica inmates.

<p>Their efforts made possible the release of more than a million 
Attica-related files that state authorities kept claiming did not exist. 
And, after a quarter of a century, prisoners won a $12 million settlement.

<p>After living through the horror of the Attica bloodshed and its 
traumatic immediate aftermath -- during which, in the words of Court TV 
material, guards "tortured him for hours with cigarettes, hot shell 
casings, threats of castration and death, a glass-strewn gauntlet and 
Russian roulette" -- Frank Smith looks back with evident clarity. "Attica 
was about wants and needs," he says. "Attica was a lot about class and a 
lot about race."

<p>"The Ghosts of Attica" illuminates many dimensions, past and 
present. "This movie is about the struggle for justice," film maker David 
Van Taylor told me. The struggle continues; the ghosts of Attica are with 
us -- in a country where the population behind bars, steeply skewed by 
economic and racial bias, is enormous.

<p>Back in 1971, the nation's prisons and jails held 330,000 people. 
Today, the number is 2 million.

<p>Many are incarcerated for drug-related offenses. A petition 
submitted to the United Nations in late August condemned the U.S. war on 
drugs as "not a war on plants or chemicals, but on citizens and other human 
beings who all too often are members of racial and ethnic minorities." 
Reuters news service noted that "whites use as many drugs as Latinos and 
African Americans" -- while the petition to the UN pointed out that among 
the people locked up for drug offenses, 57 percent are black and 22 percent 
are Latino.

<p>In the present time, "Attica is such an icon, but it's an 
ill-understood icon," Van Taylor comments. While clearly focused on the 
need for social justice, the film that he co-produced does not fall into 
simple dichotomies. "The people who rebelled at Attica were not angels or 
devils," he says. They insisted on being treated as human beings.

<p>Attica guards, wounded by troopers' bullets, were betrayed and 
neglected by state authorities intent on hiding evidence and dodging 
responsibility. Mike Smith was a young guard taken hostage by prisoners, 
then shot in the stomach by state troopers. He says in the film: "I don't 
know any other employer who could murder their employees and get away with 
it, except the government."

<p>The guards and the prisoners were killed by the same gunfire, 
ordered by a governor who went on to become vice president of the United 
States. It's all in the past, and in the present. "Attica is not just an 
isolated prison," Frank Smith says. "Attica is attitudes and behavior, 
crime and punishment, education. It's about communication, it's about 
alleviating racism as much as we can, it's about the criminal justice 
system.... People need to see they are part of the problem and part of the 
solution. Attica is all of us."
