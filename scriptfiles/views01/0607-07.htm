Minutes after a federal judge ruled that the execution of Timothy 

McVeigh should proceed on Monday as scheduled, CNN was airing live 

interviews with people who lost relatives in the Oklahoma City bombing. 

When an anchor asked one woman whether she planned to attend the 

closed-circuit telecast of the execution, her reply was unequivocal: "I'll 

be there with bells on."



         <p>Overall, major news outlets were more discreet as they looked 

forward to the long-awaited execution. Yet media enthusiasm has been 

transparent. With the day of death nearing, cable news channels -- seeking 

a spike in ratings -- are making the most of the opportunity.



         <p>For CNN, which came into its own a decade ago as a national and 

global news network during the Gulf War, the latest chance to lure a big 

audience comes courtesy of McVeigh, a former U.S. Army soldier who was a 

bit player in that war. The media glory went to men named Schwarzkopf and 

Powell. More recently, infamy has gone to McVeigh.



         <p>One way or another, high-profile death has been very good for the 

media business. When the victims are foreigners on the wrong side of 

American firepower (for instance, in Baghdad or Belgrade), they serve as 

mere dots on Pentagon-produced videos of missile strikes, rapturously shown 

on this country's TV networks. In diametric contrast, when outsized 

celebrities (Princess Di or JFK Jr.) go to untimely deaths, their humanity 

looms extra large -- the opposite of blips on screens.



         <p>When U.S. taxpayers have footed the bill for bombs taking lives 

overseas -- for example, in Central America during the 1980s or in Iraq and 

Yugoslavia later on -- the victims and their mourning relatives have gotten 

scant empathetic news coverage in the United States. Consciously or 

otherwise, journalists are often quick to ask for whom the bell tolls, and 

then shrug.



         <p>In the case of the 168 people in Oklahoma City whose lives were 

cruelly destroyed, the mastermind did not become rich or attain a Cabinet 

post. He received a death sentence.



         <p>America is now in the midst of macabre synergy between 

ratings-driven TV news outlets and grief-stricken survivors of the 

explosion at the Murrah Federal Building. Perhaps each has some of what the 

other needs, or at least craves, right now. In any event, a huge media 

spectacle is approaching its grim climax.



         <p>No staged episode of "reality TV" could replicate the scale and 

scope of the government's impending real-life murder of an unrepentant 

murderer.



         <p>Generally, when death claims a loved one and changes our lives 

forever, we feel that the world should take notice, that respects should be 

paid. We may recognize, as philosopher Corliss Lamont put it, that the 

tragedy of death "is inherent in the great gift of life." And yet, at the 

same time, like Dylan Thomas, we may "Rage, rage against the dying of the 

light."



         <p>Such rage is especially acute when lives are cut short by 

intentional actions such as the one that McVeigh took on a spring day in 

1995. It's understandable that after six years of mourning and anguish, a 

relative jumped at the chance to stand in front of media microphones -- 

and, in effect, in front of the world -- to rejoice aloud that the life of 

the "delusional and suicidal" McVeigh would soon be snuffed out.



         <p>Complete with horrific criminality and lethal vengeance, the drama 

now on the nation's main stage is both a real-life calamity and a 

choreographed morality play produced largely by news media. With official 

enthusiasm from agencies with names like "Justice Department," the taking 

of a human life is rendered as affirmation of the sanctity of human life.



         <p>The equation can be understood as Orwellian; we revere life by 

inflicting death. But it's unlikely that the unprecedented media coverage 

of this execution will raise a lot of deep questions. Previews of "The 

Execution of Timothy McVeigh: The TV Show" indicate a numbing blitz of 

show-biz solemnity. If recent history is any indication, the coverage will 

rarely question a key premise of capital punishment: Our society must kill 

in order to emphasize that killing is wrong.



         <p>This grisly media show must go on. And there is no understudy 

available for the lead role. Strict procedures, spelled out in the 

government's Execution Protocol, require that guards continuously monitor 

the condemned prisoner during his final days and hours -- to make sure that 

he doesn't try to harm himself.
