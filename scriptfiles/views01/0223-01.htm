              how Bill Clinton defends himself against the charge that he traded 

              pardons for money: "The suggestion that I granted the pardons (to 

              fugitive financier Marc Rich and his equally shady business partner) 

              because Mr. Rich&#146;s wife, Denise, made political contributions 

              and contributed to the Clinton library foundation is utterly false."</font>

<P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Here&#146;s 

              how Clinton should defend himself: "Sure, I used my position of 

              trust to aid an individual who directed huge checks into the accounts 

              of committees and agencies doing work on behalf of myself and my 

              family. That&#146;s how Washington works."</font></P>

<P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If 

              Clinton challenged his Republican tormentors to go after him for 

              delivering a favor to a wealthy political giver, two things would 

              happen: First, he would get off, because the Republicans don&#146;t 

              want to open a can of worms in which they have been swimming for 

              decades.</font></P>

<P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Second, 

              Clinton might actually get the ball rolling for the sort of fundamental 

              campaign finance reform that offers the only realistic prospect 

              for banishing Washington&#146;s quid pro quo culture.</font></P>

<P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Clinton, 

              an intelligent man who has to know how absurd his excuses sound, 

              would also be able to look himself in the mirror without grimacing. 

              That&#146;s no small matter, as his explanations for the Rich pardon 

              have forced him to go far, far beyond the comic contortions that 

              so undermined his presidency ("depends on your definition of what 

              &#145;is&#146; is").</font></P>

<P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It 

              is genuinely painful to hear a grown man trying to convince Geraldo 

              Rivera that Rich got special treatment because the crook deserved 

              it &#151; or, even worse, because the good of the Middle East peace 

              process and other noble initiatives depended upon it.</font></P>

<P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 

              simple fact of the matter is that, were Rich a working Joe from 

              Milwaukee who got caught double-dealing and fled to Sault Ste. Marie 

              to escape prosecution, his application for a pardon would have been 

              acted upon by the Clinton White House with all the speed and serious 

              consideration of Confederacy-complimenting Attorney General John 

              Ashcroft addressing a civil rights complaint.</font></P>

<P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Rich 

              got a break because he is, uh, rich, and because his agents were 

              willing to disperse a little of that wealth in Billy boy&#146;s 

              direction. That&#146;s wrong, but it is also precisely the sort 

              of quid pro quo equation that defines how business is done in Washington.</font></P>

<P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Does 

              anyone really believe the George W. Bush administration would be 

              looking to open the Alaskan wilderness for oil drilling if the energy 

              industry had not directed big bucks into Bush&#146;s campaign accounts? 

              Could anyone seriously question that Bush is moving to block workplace 

              safety standards solely because industry lobbyists guided millions 

              into his campaign coffers? Is it possible that there is even a single 

              person in America who believes genetically modified foods would 

              be allowed to be sold in supermarkets without labels were it not 

              for the tens of millions of dollars spent to influence politicians 

              by agribusiness interests?</font></P>

<P align="left">

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

Yes, 

              the Marc Rich pardon was irresponsible, immoral and almost certainly 

              &#151; though probably unprovably &#151; illegal. But, as quid pro 

              quos go, this one is so low on the list of Capitol crimes as to 

              be inconsequential. If the rest of the federal government&#146;s 

              quid pro quos were as benign as this one, America would be a safer, 

              cleaner and healthier land.
