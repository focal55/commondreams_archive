<i>"The dead have been awakened—shall I sleep?

The world’s at war with tyrants—shall I crouch?

The harvest’s ripe—and shall I pause to reap?

I slumber not; the thorn is in my couch;

Each day a trumpet soundeth in mine ear,

Its echo in my heart."</i><br>



- Lord Byron



<p>I spent yesterday climbing to the summit of this bald bulb of a hill called 

Mt. Monadnock, which rises incongruously from the level plains of southern 

New Hampshire.  The day was bright and clear with little wind, a perfect day 

for a hike.  I reached the top in under two hours and paused to absorb the 

view.  New England lay before me to all points on the compass, brown and 

prepared for winter.  Here and there were lakes and houses.  In the distance 

something burned, sending a column of smoke into the air.



<p>The hard blue November sky was stitched with white lines that crossed each 

other in every direction, as if a deranged skywriter had decided to paint 

the air repeatedly with the letter 'A.'  It took me a moment to understand 

what I was seeing: contrails from combat aircraft arriving and departing 

from various bases across the region.  Even here, 4,000 feet above the 

world, the troubles that consume us hover above, close enough to touch.



<p>Then again, that is the rub.  Once upon a time this nation seemed above the 

world, of it but beyond its scalding touch.  We were protected by two 

oceans, vast treasure, armed guardians, and thousands of atom-tipped 

missiles buried in the earth.  One day the sky fell in, and we found 

ourselves somewhere we had not been for generations.  We found ourselves in 

the middle of things.  We found ourselves to be vulnerable.



<p>A fundamental shift of comprehension has been fermenting within the minds of 

American citizens since September 11th.  All of a sudden, the realization 

that each and every citizen has a stake in the actions and policies of this 

country has begun to take root.  Simply, if justice fails, the common folk 

become targets.  If economic privation goes unchecked, the common folk 

become targets.  If extremism, American or otherwise,  achieves too much 

power, the common folk become targets.



<p>If a liberal, progressive agenda is to achieve purchase in today's climate, 

this basic truth must be seized upon and repeated over and over again.  The 

fellow who only reads the sports page, who hasn't voted for twenty years, or 

who votes Republican because he likes his tax cut, needs to have a finger 

thrust into his face.  He needs to be made to understand that the next 

intelligence failure, the next proxy war, the next arms deal, the next 

corporate bailout, could result in his shattered corpse lying in the dust.



<p>This is brutal and cruel.  It is also the truth.  We are all on the firing 

line.  We are the targets in this war.  There are reasons for this that have 

nothing to do with people who hate our freedoms.



<p>This is the most dangerous idea in the world for those currently in power in 

America.  It is an idea that has taken a slow burn through the populace.  If 

it flares alight, people will not shop.  They will not tolerate excessive 

tax cuts for financially healthy corporations.  They will demand solutions 

that do not involve carpet-bombing with B-52s.  They will not stand for the 

dissolution of their constitutional rights.  In short, they will demand 

actions that will reap actual results, instead of actions that give only the 

illusion of progress.  They will want to move forward as progressives 

instead of backwards as conservatives.  They will know that their very 

survival depends upon it.



<p>Liberals and progressives must seize this time, must pour kerosene on that 

slowly burning idea, until it explodes into a pyre upon which will burn all 

of the sad, sorry, broken policies that brought us to this house of woe.



<p>But who is to do it?



<p>It has become an article of faith since January 20th, 2001, that the 

Democratic chieftains who walk the halls of power in Washington D.C. can not 

be trusted to fight for this agenda.  When the results of the scandalous 

2000 election were ratified in Congress, only the Black Caucus had the 

courage to turn their backs in protest.  When religious extremist John 

Ashcroft stood for nomination as Attorney General, no true opposition was 

offered.



<p>Today, as the 4th, 6th and 13th Amendments to the Constitution are disposed 

of, as Posse Comitatus is replaced by clandestine military tribunals that 

know no civil authority, the Democrats stand almost completely silent.  Only 

the timely defection of Senator James Jeffords has allowed Democrats to 

thwart Republican thrusts into the Federal larder and our environmental 

inheritance.  Had Jeffords not jumped, there would be no stopping the GOP.



<p>Democratic Senator and Presidential hopeful John Edwards worked night and 

day to craft the abominable PATRIOT Anti-Terrorism bill, possibly the most 

invasive bit of work to come out of Washington since Lincoln suspended 

habeas corpus.  Perhaps he believes that we must destroy freedom in order to 

save it, but it is more likely that he succumbed to political cowardice and 

went along for the ride to ensure a safe trip to the primaries in 2004.  He 

is certainly not alone in this.



<p>On any other day, the anthrax sent to Senators Daschle and Leahy would be 

called assassination attempts.  Today, these attacks are shrouded in the 

threatening veil of international terrorism, despite the fact that they 

almost certainly originated from the Ashcroftian wing of the American Right. 

  Even after this most dire of threats, the Democrats stand mute.  Bush 

enjoys approval ratings that would make Jesus Christ Himself blush, a 

formidable obstacle for Democrats who may feel in their gut that the nation 

is on the road to Hell.  Their timidity is our catastrophe.



<p>Thus, it falls to us.  We must become the calcium in the withered Democratic 

backbone, and we must do it now.



<p>Writing to these people is useless.  Protesting against the President will 

bear no fruit.  Letters to the editor go unread. Emails to like-minded 

friends amount to political masturbation.  We are a people made too 

comfortable by pleasant arguments and debates.  The day has arrived where 

action is demanded, else all that happens from here on out can be lain at 

our own feet.  The document in question says We The People for a good 

reason.



<p>Take heed of conservative successes.  They ran for state representative 

positions, took over school boards, got jobs in local government and 

basically stormed the bulwarks of the Republican Party from the bottom of 

the walls.  It took ten years, but they did it, and the Presidency of George 

W. Bush is but one reward they have reaped by their labors.  The media is 

awash with the conservative viewpoint because they commandeered the dialogue 

after years of grass-roots work.  This is another reward, one that ensures 

their continued success.



<p>To overcome this, we must become it.



<p>The only reason the Democrats moved to the right is because of the 

aforementioned conservative grass-roots revolution.  The Party had nothing 

to counteract the surge of conservatism that blasted through Washington, no 

shock troops of their own, so they swung Rightward in order to survive.  

Now, the Parties are slowly becoming indistinguishable.  They are not yet 

there, no matter what Ralph Nader says, but they are on their way and this 

can not be denied.



<p>It has been argued that true progressives will never find a home in the 

Democratic Party, because it has sold too much of its soul in a hard tack to 

the right borne of defensive strategy and political expediency.  This leaves 

two alternatives: either abandon the Party completely, or roll up some 

sleeves and clean out the Augean stables.



<p>Despite its flaws, the Democratic Party is the best tool we have available 

for the propagation of the liberal, progressive agenda.  The Party have 

faithful followers in every state, and unconquerable strongholds on both 

coasts.  The Democratic political machine stands in every county in every 

state in the Union.  There are doubtless men and women in the U.S. House of 

Representatives who would savor the chance to act upon principle, instead of 

from a core of self-defense, a chance we can give them if we get to work 

now.



<p>The time has come to invade this Party, to storm the battlements from the 

ground up.  The Democratic Party can again become a bastion of true 

liberalism, as the Republican Party has become a bastion of 

ultraconservatism, if American progressives take it over from pillar to 

post.  If we take back the Party, if we change the dialogue coming from the 

media through the brute reality of our strident and unyielding voices, if we 

tend and nurture that flame of new comprehension blazing in every American 

breast, we can achieve all that our dreams have whispered.



<p>Most within the Party will welcome this, I believe.  Those who do not can be 

reminded of the wisdom spoken by an old politico named James H. Rowe: "The 

old bulls never quit until the young bulls run them out.  The old bulls are 

dead."



<p>Master the issues.  Walk down to your local Democratic Party office and find 

work.  Take as much responsibility as you can, and make it your office.  Run 

for positions on your school board, or within your local government, or 

stand for election to your state congress.  If you can not do these things, 

find someone who is doing them and dedicate your energies to their success.  

Run the old bulls out, and harness the young bulls to plow new fields.  Make 

the Party a home for everyone who knows in their heart that things must 

change in this country before the targets can be stripped from our backs.



<p>It will take time and patience.  There is a window of opportunity to act in 

time for the 2002 elections, but the target should be 2004.  Don't look to 

the Oval office, for working from the top down has bred a dizzying array of 

recent failures.  Go from the ground up, one step at a time.



<p>What a paradise we can make of this world if given the chance.  The chance 

will not come on its own.  We must make it, take it, demand it, fight for it 

tooth and nail.



<p>Get to work.
