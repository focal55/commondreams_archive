Last night I had the strangest dream...
<p>
   All of America's wealthy, 
conservative and safely belligerent pundits had been delivered by a 
just and beneficent Almighty Power to a Palestinian refugee camp, 
following the bulldozing of their homes--including vacation 
homes--and the expropriation of all their possessions. Instead of 
pontificating between beach walks and vodka tonics in Vineyard Haven, 
these armchair bombardiers were treated to rivers of open sewage and 
hopeless lives of beggary. Those who resisted were arrested, tortured 
and selectively assassinated. Meanwhile, editorial pages across 
America cheered the "restraint" of their tormentors.
</p>
<p>
In 
extremely lengthy articles, the <i>New York Times</i> and <i>The New 
York Review of Books</i> recently demonstrated beyond any doubt that 
the Israelis (and the Americans) shared in the blame for the 
breakdown of peace negotiations and ensuing cycle of violence that 
now tragically appears to be engulfing the region. To the 
punditocracy, however, these dispassionately argued, extensively 
reported stories amounted to an existential insult of near biblical 
proportions. Marty Peretz's <i>New Republic</i> published a vicious 
attack on the articles by Robert Satloff, executive director of a 
pro-Israel think tank. William Safire got so excited, he denounced 
his own newspaper in a hysterical fit of ad hominemism: "Do not 
swallow this speculative rewriting of recent events," he warned 
readers. "The overriding reason for the war against Israel today is 
that Yasir Arafat decided that war was the way to carry out the 
often-avowed Palestinian plan. Its first stage is to create a West 
Bank state from the Jordan River to the sea with Jerusalem as its 
capital. Then, by flooding Israel with 'returning' Palestinians, the 
plan in its promised final phase would drive the hated Jews from the 
Middle East."
</p>
<p>
Mortimer Zuckerman, in his capacity as 
chairman of the Conference of Presidents of Major Jewish American 
Organizations, insisted, "This is just revisionist history.... There 
is one truth, period: The Palestinians caused the breakdown at Camp 
David and then rejected Clinton's plan in January." The baldest 
comment came from the Zionist Organization of America's president, 
Morton Klein: "Whether their account is accurate or not is 
irrelevant.... I reject any discussion of what 
happened."
</p>
<p>
In the wake of the suicide bombings, three 
different <i>Washington Post</i> pundits demanded war three days in a 
row. Michael Kelly, recently seen complaining about too many fatsoes 
at the beach, advised the Israelis to unleash "an overwhelming 
force...to destroy, kill, capture and expel the armed Palestinian 
forces." The more moderate George Will called only for a "short war." 
(Charles Krauthammer did not specify a length.) To read these 
would-be warriors, you would think the Palestinians were summering in 
Edgartown. A reader would never guess that a regional superpower is 
carrying out a brutal military occupation, coupled with a settlement 
policy that directly contravenes Article 49 of the Geneva Convention. 

</p>
<p>
No one with any sense would argue that Arafat and his 
corrupt cronies do not bear considerable responsibility for the 
collapse of any hope of peace in the Middle East in the near future. 
And suicide bombers against civilian targets in Israel are as 
counterproductive as they are immoral (though those who settle in 
occupied territory are knowingly putting themselves in harm's way and 
hence share some responsibility when their families are forced to pay 
for this fanaticism with their lives). Nevertheless, a conflict where 
"our team" engages in terrorism, assassination and the apparently 
routine torture of teenagers to defend a cruel and illegal occupation 
is one in which neither side holds a monopoly on virtue. 

</p>
<p>
Since a majority of Israelis supports a freeze in the 
provocative practice of settlement-building, the mindless hysteria of 
the American punditocracy must have other sources than mere logic. 
It's dangerous to draw firm conclusions without any special knowledge 
about the psyches of those involved, but much of the materially 
comfortable American Jewish community has had an unhappy history of 
defending the principle of Jewish sovereignty over captured 
Palestinian lands right down to the death of the last Israeli. 
Because of the sacrifices they demand of others, many American Jews 
feel they must be holier than the Pope when defending Israeli human 
rights abuses. <i>The New Republic</i>'s Peretz is a particularly 
interesting specimen. He reflexively defends everything Israel does 
and routinely slanders its critics. Peretz, who owes his prominence 
to money, in this case his (non-Jewish) wife's fortune--which allowed 
him to purchase his magazine--has never published a single book or 
written a significant piece of scholarship, reportage or criticism. 
It's not hard to imagine that his self-appointed role as Israel's 
American Torquemada--seen in his obsession with smearing the 
world-renowned Palestinian scholar and activist Edward Said--is 
inspired as much by guilt and envy as by more rational motivations. 
(I say this as a supporter of the peace process who has respectfully 
disagreed with almost all Said has said about the conflict in recent 
years.)
</p>
<p>
Whatever the reason, the net result is the same. 
For a brief moment in recent history, when Israel had a government 
that was dedicated to finding a way to make peace, the warrior 
pundits were placed on the defensive and the Palestinians received a 
reasonably fair shake from the nation's elite media. More recently, a 
review of leading editorial pages by the ADL found that "the major 
newspapers across the country are viewing the situation in the Middle 
East in a realistic and objective manner." The authors of the study 
helpfully defined their terms. To the ADL "realistic and objective" 
means "critical of and hostile to Arafat...directly blaming him for 
the continuing violence and creating a climate of hatred" along with 
the dismissal of all Palestinian peace overtures as "calculated tools 
for his goal of gaining further concessions from 
Israel."
</p>
<p>
In a rational world, the ADL report would at least 
complicate efforts by Safire, <i>TNR</i> and others to charge the 
media with "pro-Arab" and "anti-Israel" bias. Alas, I'm betting 
<i>bubkes</i>...
