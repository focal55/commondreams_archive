<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The fall of Enron sounds the death knell for one

      of the great rackets of the past decade: green seals of approval,

      whereby some outfit like the Natural Resources Defense Council

      or the Environmental Defense Fund would issue testimonials to

      the enviro-conscience and selfless devotion to the public weal

      of corporations like Enron.</font>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">These green seals of approval were part

      of the neoliberal pitch, that fuddy-duddy regulation should yield

      to modern, &quot;market-oriented solutions&quot; to environmental

      problems, which essentially means bribing corporations in the

      hope they'll stop their polluting malpractices. Indeed, NRDC

      and EDF were always the prime salesfolk of neoliberal remedies

      for environmental problems. In fact, NRDC was socked into the

      Enron lobby machine so deep you couldn't see the soles of its

      feet. Here's what happened. </font></P>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 1997 high-flying Enron found itself

      in a pitched battle in Oregon, where it planned to acquire Portland

      General Electric, Oregon's largest public utility. Warning that

      Enron's motives were of a highly predatory nature, the staff

      of the state's Public Utility Commission (PUC) opposed the merger.

      They warned that an Enron takeover would mean less ability to

      protect the environment, increased insecurity for PGE's workers

      and, in all likelihood, soaring prices. Other critics argued

      that Enron's actual plan was to cannibalize PGE, in particular

      its hydropower, which Enron would sell into California's energy

      market. </font></P>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But at the very moment when such protests

      threatened to balk Enron of its prize, into town rode NRDC's

      top energy commissar, Ralph Cavanagh, Heinz environmental genius

      award pinned to his armor and flaunting ties to the Energy Foundation,

      a San Francisco-based outfit providing financial wattage for

      many citizen and environmental groups that work on utility and

      enviro issues. </font></P>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Cavanagh lost no time whipping the refractory

      Oregon greens into line. In concert with Enron, the NRDC man

      put together a memo of understanding, pledging that the company

      would lend financial support to some of these groups' pet projects.

      </font></P>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But Cavanagh still had some arduous politicking

      ahead. An OK for the merger had to come from the PUC, whose staff

      was adamantly opposed. So, on Valentine's Day, 1997, Cavanagh

      showed up at a hearing in Salem, Oregon, to plead Enron's case.

      </font></P>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Addressing the three PUC commissioners,

      Cavanagh averred that this was &quot;the first time I've ever

      spoken in support of a utility merger.&quot; If so, it was the

      quickest transition from virginity to seasoned service in the

      history of intellectual prostitution. Cavanagh flaunted the delights

      of an Enron embrace: &quot;What we've put before you with this

      company is, we believe, a robust assortment of public benefits

      for the citizens of Oregon which would not emerge, Mr. Chairman,

      without the merger.&quot; </font></P>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">With a warble in his throat, Cavanagh

      moved into rhetorical high gear: &quot;The Oregonian asks the

      question, 'Can you trust Enron?' On stewardship issues and public

      benefit issues I've dealt with this company for a decade, often

      in the most contentious circumstances, and the answer is, yes.&quot;

      </font></P>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Cavanagh won the day for the Houston-based

      energy giant. The PUC approved the merger, and it wasn't long

      before the darkest suspicions of Enron's plans were vindicated.

      The company raised rates, tried to soak the ratepayers with the

      cost of its failed Trojan nuclear reactor and moved to put some

      of PGE's most valuable assets on the block. Enron's motive had

      indeed been to get access to the hydropower of the Northwest,

      the cheapest in the country, and sell it into the California

      market, the priciest and-in part because of Cavanagh's campaigning

      for deregulation-a ripe energy prize awaiting exploitation. </font></P>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Then, after two years, the company Cavanagh

      had hailed as being &quot;engaged and motivated&quot; put PGE

      up on the auction block. Pending sale of PGE, Enron has been

      using it as collateral for loans approved by a federal bankruptcy

      judge.</font></P>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Enron is best known as George W. Bush's

      prime financial backer in his presidential quest. But it was

      a bipartisan purveyor of patronage: to its right, conservative

      Texas Senator Phil Gramm; to its left, liberal Texas Democrat

      Sheila Jackson-Lee (who had Enron's CEO Ken Lay as her finance

      chairman in a Democratic primary fight preluding her first successful

      Congressional bid; her Democratic opponent was Craig Washington,

      an anti-NAFTA maverick Democrat the Houston establishment didn't

      care for). </font></P>

<P>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Today some House Republicans want to

      treat the Enron collapse as a criminal matter, while Democrats

      have been talking in vaguer terms about cleaning up accounting

      rules and plugging holes in the regulatory system. The inability

      of Enron's employees to sell company stock from their 401(k)s

      while high-ups absconded with millions may doom Bush's promised

      onslaught on Social Security. There are many morals in Enron's

      collapse, and the role of that green seal of approval should

      not be forgotten.
