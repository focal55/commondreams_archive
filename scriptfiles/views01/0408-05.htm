The scene is played out at most airports around the world. For every Indian passenger, about a dozen people turn up to greet him or bid <i>bon voyage. </i>The phenomenon is worth celebrating, not getting irritated about, says philosopher-diplomat Kishore Mahbubani, author of <i>Can Asians Think?</i> 

<P></P>

He was illustrating to a Toronto audience Monday night that the family remains central to Asians and that they will protect such traditions in the face of Western, largely individualistic, cultural values being bombarded at them.

<P></P>

Mahbubani is Singapore's envoy to the United Nations and concurrently Canada. A director of the International Peace Academy, a former fellow at Harvard University and an essayist who has been called the Asian Toynbee, he has been asking tough questions of his fellow-Asians, such as: Why was Asia asleep for 1,000 years while Europe prospered?

<P></P>

Having answered it - that the continent is, in fact, awake and may match or even surpass Western standards - Mahbubani is addressing Europeans and North Americans: Is the Western epoch coming to an end?

<P></P>

Maybe. He is more certain, though, about the dangers of our post-Cold War pomposity.

<P></P>

The West has abrogated unto itself "the moral high ground from which it lectures the world." Except that the people being hectored at "see no high ground," only double standards on democracy, human rights and globalization.

<P></P>

The West vouches by free trade but closes its markets to Asian textiles and Caribbean bananas. It dumps Mobutu Sese Seko the moment his usefulness in the anti-Communism war is over. "Why not take responsibility for him, and what followed?" (Ditto the Afghan Mujahideen).

<P></P>

The U.S. and the U.K. are hard on Libya but Italy isn't. Is that because it is only a pond away from Moammar Gadhafi's possible mischief-making? 

<P></P>

Europe winks at the Algerian military nullifying elections, fearing destabilization and an outpouring of refugees to France. But Peru is punished with sanctions for reversing its democratic trend.

<P></P>

The West is tough on China post-Tiananmen Square, secure that any chaos there won't spill over to Europe or North America. "Would the West be as tough on Beijing if China were located where either Turkey or Mexico is?''

<P></P>

Inconsistencies are more pronounced in the Middle East, Mahbubani says. There's total disregard of human rights in Israel and the occupied territories and, to a lesser degree, in oil-rich Arab states.

<P></P>

"The West seems to be almost deliberately pursuing a course designed to anger the Islamic world," he writes. 

<P></P>

Mahbubani concludes that "the West will take a moral stand only when its fundamental interest is not involved," as in Myanmar.

<P></P>

But he is a realist: "All societies will always pursue their self-interest." Rather, his point is that Western governments "find it impossible to speak honestly to their citizens" - and the world.

<P></P>

Therefore they shouldn't be surprised when Asians say: "Don't lecture us.'' Life is as complex, if not more so, in the poorer parts of the world than in the well-to-do West.

<P></P>

"When you rule a country like China, every day you hold it together is a miracle. There will be ups and downs. Most societies have had their chapters of violence, including the United States which had a Civil War. Tiananmen was a battle between soft authoritarians and hard authoritarians. The Western media reported the victory of hardliners but they failed to tell the world of the true aftermath: The soft authoritarians have come back to power.''

<P></P>

While "Russia put <i>glasnost </i>ahead of <i>perestroika, </i>China went the other way - and has been the more successful.''

<P></P>

Is Mahbubani saying that a little authoritarianism is good, as in his Singapore where people get caned for the most minor infractions?

<P></P>

"Singapore needs no defence," he shoots back. "It has political, social and economic stability. People from all over Asia come to learn from us.''

<P></P>

His larger point is that while there are universal values, the degree of adherence is different from society to society. What the world needs is democracy and free markets, but not all nations can get there overnight.

<P></P>

"Look how long it took the West to give women the right to vote, give blacks the right to vote ... Taiwan and South Korea wouldn't have made the progress they did had the West insisted in the 1960s that they take a more democratic route.''

<P></P>

Asia wants the Western economic model but not its social ills: erosion of religion; breakdown of the family, glorification of guns on the screen; proliferation of drug usage. 

<P></P>

In resisting such forces, Asians are not asserting the superiority of Asian values, only that their own values are not inferior.

<P></P>

Mutual respect, not recrimination, will get the East-West fusion the world needs, badly.
