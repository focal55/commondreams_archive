The talking heads on television discuss the imminent use of doomsday devices

like chemical, biological and nuclear weapons.   Our specie's only hope for

survival is to stop the cycle of killing before it lurches further out-of-

control.   I experienced World War  II and the Cold War, but this is the

most frightening time I can remember.



<p>The United States' military is about to launch a strike against Osama bin

Laden, who is alleged to be the  mysterious mastermind of the Al Qaeda

network responsible for the September 11 terrorist "Attack on America".  Bin

Laden was trained in terrorism by the U.S. Central Intelligence as a

"freedom fighter" in the 1980s to oust the Russians from Afghanistan and the

ruling Taliban that is alleged to be hiding him was put into power with U.S.

approval to "stabilize" the country after the U.S. sponsored war.



<p>Afghanistan's next-door-neighbor to the east is Pakistan, described  in the

New York Times on October 2 as a "place about to blow" that "has long been

the speculated locale for one of the world's worst nightmare scenarios, in

which Islamic terrorists, in league with rogue elements of the military,

seize control of the government and wield the vengeful sword of jihad with a

nuclear tip."   The story called Pakistan "a strange choice as America's

indispensable ally in the hunt for bin Laden" because thousands of Islamic

terrorists like the ones who killed 40 people in an October 1 "suicide"

attack on a  Kashmir legislative body.  These Pakistan-based terrorists

operate with government support and Pakistan's military ruler felt his

country's survival was at stake when he was faced with a

join-us-or-fight -us ultimatum from the Bush administration.  The Wall

Street Journal reported on October 3 that India's prime minister "suggested

Washington's ally of convenience on Afghanistan's border is itself a

supporter of terrorism."



<p>Afghanistan's neighboring nation to the west is Iran whose governments have

been agitated and manipulated by U.S. interests for almost 50 years.  In

1953 the United States instigated a coup against Muhammad Musaddiq, the

prime minister who was bringing a more democratic socialist government to

replace the monarchy, because we felt he was too neutral in the struggle

against the Soviet Union in the Cold War.  We bolstered up the Shah of Iran

who allowed the U.S. access to it's oil and to build  military bases in Iran

on the border of the Soviets.  The Shah ruled Iran until he was finally

overthrown in 1979 by  Islamic fundamentalists led by the Ayatollah

Khomeini.  The militant Islamic religious regime allowed the U.S. Embassy to

be taken over by students and held the U.S. personnel hostage in a struggle

that went on for a year and established the Iranian government as firmly

Anti-Western.  In 1981-1983 the United States supported Iraq in a war

against Iran and in 1996 the U.S. declared a total ban on trade with Iran.

Last week Iran announced that they would not allow the U.S. to use their

airspace to attack the Taliban in Afghanistan, and, on October 2,  Iran and

Russia signed a pact for a full resumption in arms sales to Iran.



<p>Afghanistan's northern border is occupied by Tajikistan, a sworn ally to

Bush's ant-terrorist efforts and according to the Wall Street Journal on

October 2 "a major conduit for heroin and opium on its way to consumers in

Europe."  The Afghan drug trade yields about 75% of the world's heroin and

the warlords who make-up the Northern Alliance in Afghanistan that opposes

the Taliban militarily are big players in the heroin market.



<p>Also, occupying part of the northern border of Afghanistan is China, with a

much greater nuclear capability than Pakistan.  "Red China" was a great Cold

War enemy and we have had very strained relationships with them recently

after bombing their embassy in Belgrade in May, 1999 and the mid-air run-in

between our spy plane and a Chinese fighter in April 2001.



<p>While U. S. based corporate interests made giant profits in the process U.S.

citizen/taxpayers have funded terrorism for the last 50 years in South-East

Asia, Latin American, Africa, and the Middle East that has killed and

dispossessed many thousands of poor  people. . Now the terror has

come-home-to-kill as martyrs-for-the-cause of people who have felt the pain

of U.S. funded terror finally got the attention of the sole-super-power,

thumb-your-nose-at-world, United States.



<p>The desperate men who consider themselves and millions of others of their

beliefs to be victims of  continuing U.S. intrigue and exploitation in the

Middle-East brought soul searching reality to  the terror-is-okay-over-there

attitude of  U.S. citizens with a terrible terrorist attack on the ultimate

symbols of United States power.  The availability of chemical, biological

and nuclear weapon to zealots  whose ultimate panacea is murderous religious

martyrdom makes it imperative to take a close look at our policies that have

caused such hatred of the United States before we go lemming-like into the

abyss.
