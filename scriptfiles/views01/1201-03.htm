President Bush's secret military tribunals will make the Constitution the

greatest casualty in the war on terrorism.



<p>Under the military order Bush signed Nov. 13, these tribunals will be

presided over by military officers who will serve as judge and jury. The

panels will be able to convict a defendant with a two-thirds majority vote.

Possible punishments include life imprisonment and the death penalty. There

are no appeals.



<p>Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld has broad discretion in what evidence

would be allowed and what level of proof would be required for convictions.



<p>The executive order applies to non-U.S. citizens engaged in acts designed to

have "adverse effects on the United States, its citizens, national security

or economy" and anyone who has "knowingly harbored" such persons.



<p>These tribunals represent one of the most serious assaults on civil

liberties in this country's history.

"To our knowledge, the move to establish a military tribunal when Congress

has not declared war is unprecedented," said Laura Murphy of the American

Civil Liberties Union.



<p>The American Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee released a statement saying

that "such tribunals would bypass all of the basic protections of American

legal system and constitutional rights of suspects and could not possibly

constitute a fair trial or afford a reasonable chance for an effective

defense. Such measures smack of martial law and are reminiscent of

human-rights violations which have been routinely deplored by the United

States when employed by other nations."



<p>David Cole, constitutional law professor at Georgetown University Law

Center, suggests that a military tribunal would be used equally against

citizens and non-citizens. "The fact that the administration has limited it

to noncitizens suggests this was a political move -- the idea being that if

we limit it to noncitizens, we are less likely to get criticized for it

because we can assure citizens that their rights aren't going to be denied.

But, in reality, if this can be done to noncitizens, it can be done to

citizens, as well."



<p>Bush proclaimed in response to Sept. 11, "We will find those who did it; we

will smoke them out of their holes; we will get them running and we'll bring

them to justice."



<p>Unfortunately, when the smoke clears, the Constitution will emerge as a

badly burned document. And the damage to the nation could be irreparable.

Military tribunals are bad for America and bad for democracy.
