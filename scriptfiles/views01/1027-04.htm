The political mood in the country has never been more belligerent. Public opinion 

  polls taken even before the full force of anthrax hysteria engulfed the country 

  showed that four-fifths support not only the use of ground troops in Afghanistan, 

  but also military action against other countries in the Middle East&#151;and 

  three-quarters of Americans favor military action against countries <i>outside</i> 

  the Middle East.

<p>These numbers free the Bush administration from any political constraints on 

  widening the war beyond Afghanistan. The &#147;zero casualties&#148; mentality 

  that governed our military brass for the past two decades went up in smoke when 

  the hijacked plane exploded in the Pentagon. It has now evaporated in the country 

  as well. In the wake of the bioterrorism scare, fear and frustration will drive 

  even higher the public frenzy to lash out with bombs and bullets at someone&#151;anyone.</p>

<p>The escalation strategy is now clear, particularly after Dubya&#146;s October 

  11 prime-time press conference: We will expand military strikes against other 

  countries <i>ad seriatim</i>. There is no question that Iraq is next on the 

  list. The new chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Richard Myers, let 

  slip on <i>Meet the Press</i> that we are selecting targets in Iraq. And when 

  Dubya went out of his way to publicly praise Paul Wolfowitz, the Pentagon&#146;s 

  No. 2 and its most fervent hawk on Iraq, his goal became obvious.</p>

<p>The administration is already leaking selected &#147;intelligence&#148; designed 

  to soften up the American people for a new war in Iraq&#151;we are being told 

  of meetings between the hijacker&#146;s leader, Mohammed Atta, and Iraqi secret 

  service officers in Czechoslovakia, and of the British-educated Iraqi scientist 

  Rihab Tabar (nicknamed &#147;Dr. Germ&#148;) as the mastermind behind the anthrax 

  attacks (even though the former head of Russia&#146;s chemical and biological 

  warfare program&#151;Ken Abilek, now a U.S.-based consultant&#151;told Ted Koppel 

  on <i>Nightline</i> that he is convinced al-Qaeda purchased the anthrax and 

  other toxins and technology from Russian scientists left impoverished when their 

  huge chemical and biological weapons establishment of 30,000 technicians was 

  dismantled). But the sanguineous despot Saddam Hussein is easy to hate, and 

  it will take very little to convince Americans that he must be the next target 

  in the long war.</p>

<p>We are plunging down that bloody road with no debate in Congress. Indeed, major 

  figures in both parties&#151;like Joe Lieberman and John McCain&#151;are already 

  voicing their support for hitting Iraq. And this even though the Gulf War demonstrated 

  that Saddam cannot be toppled by air power alone&#151;it will require investing 

  the entire country with a huge army of occupation to end the Ba&#146;ath regime&#146;s 

  sorry history. The use of tactical nuclear weapons in Afghanistan is already 

  being called for by congressional Republicans&#151;not just hard-right ignoramuses 

  like Arizona Sen. Jon Kyl, but also moderate Long Island Rep. Peter King and 

  influential Indiana Rep. Steve Buyer. When an invasion of Iraq confronts our 

  finger-in-the-wind elected representatives with the prospect of thousands of 

  their constituents coming home in body bags, the cry of &#147;nuke Saddam&#148; 

  will be widespread.</p>

<p>However, Bush will not move with full force against Iraq until the Taliban 

  falls. And those in the punditocracy like the <i>Wall Street Journal</i>&#146;s 

  Al Hunt&#151;who predicted on CNN that the Taliban will collapse &#147;within 

  a week&#148;&#151;are dreaming. The air campaign to pave the way for the minority 

  Northern Alliance&#146;s entrance into Kabul is only stiffening the resistance 

  among Southern Afghanistan&#146;s Pashtun majority, for the fratricidal history 

  of Afghan civil war makes the prospect of ethnic cleansing in the event of an 

  Alliance victory very real.</p>

<p>International politics is rather like chess; one has to be able to think eight 

  to ten moves ahead. That&#146;s something American presidents of the past 50 

  years have not been very good at&#151;they cannot see farther than the next 

  election. Bush is no chess player, and the madness of militarizing the campaign 

  against terrorism becomes clearer every day, for war has its own momentum&#151;once 

  set in motion, the machine operates on its own inexorable logic, divorced from 

  rational political goals.</p>

<p>U.S. military action in Afghanistan is already outpacing Bush&#146;s murky 

  political objectives. American efforts to put together a coalition government 

  under the aegis of the octogenarian King Zahir have stalled amid the squabbling 

  of the heroin-dealing warlords who are our purchased allies. Pakistan, of course, 

  detests the Northern Alliance, and neither has it forgotten that the king tried 

  to annex part of Pakistan in the &#146;60s. </p>

<p>President Pervez Musharraf will face enormous difficulty in keeping the lid 

  on growing opposition in Pakistan if a hastily cobbled-together regime considered 

  hostile to Pakistani interests takes symbolic power in Kabul. Musharraf&#146;s 

  limited purge of his military and intelligence chiefs is an admission of weakness, 

  not a demonstration of strength: More than a quarter of Pakistan&#146;s military 

  are Pashtun, and, in addition to the ethnic and religious sympathies that bind 

  much of the officer corps and most of the Pakistani intelligence service to 

  the Taliban, the corruption of the Pakistani military by heroin-trafficking 

  links them economically to the Taliban-supporting local Afghan chieftains as 

  well.</p>

<p>In this context, the American bombing has created what the BBC has rightly 

  characterized as a &#147;humanitarian, political and security crisis&#148; on 

  the Afghan-Pakistani border, where tens of thousands of hunger-mad Afghan refugees 

  are massing. The BBC and others have filmed the Taliban rounding up the men, 

  separating them from the women and children, and stocking them in barbed-wire 

  camps for conscription or ethnic cleansing. But whether Pakistan continues to 

  keep them out at gunpoint, or lets them enter (something that this country, 

  which is $140 billion in debt and already hosting some 4 million refugees, cannot 

  afford to do), these refugees constitute a political powder keg whose existence 

  further destabilizes Musharraf and increases his vulnerability to a coup. (If 

  he goes, who controls Pakistan&#146;s nukes?)</p>

<p>Add to this volatile mix the mounting civilian casualties from American bombing 

  (including the destruction of a hospital, confirmed by U.N. observers) and one 

  wonders how long Musharraf can hold on&#151;particularly with India using the 

  war as cover to step up its military activity in Kashmir, thus inflaming both 

  the Pakistani military and the masses in the street. Moreover, Seymour Hersh&#146;s 

  fine reporting in <i>The New Yorker</i> has underscored just how fragile is 

  the sclerotic Saudi princes&#146; hold on their country. No wonder both Pakistan 

  and the Saudis are pleading for Bush to stop the bombing. If the terrorists 

  think the air campaign in Afghanistan has made the endlessly corrupt Saud family 

  ripe for overthrow, they could strike the highly vulnerable Saudi oil fields, 

  ending the cash flow that allows the 6,000 princes to stay in power (an eventuality 

  which would drive oil to $100 a barrel and send the world economy plummeting 

  rapidly into a Depression).</p>

<p>Yet these gaping flaws in Bush&#146;s war policy are not being challenged by 

  congressional Democrats, whose leaders&#151;Tom Daschle and Dick Gephardt&#151;still 

  harbor illusions that they are viable presidential candidates, and so are loath 

  to challenge on any front the conduct of a popular war. Now, in the wake of 

  the anthrax scare that sent the cowardly House skedaddling, the Bushies are 

  floating a proposal to let the president govern by decree for at least 30 days 

  without any congressional approval or restraint if he decides a &#147;national 

  emergency&#148; warrants it. The power of the purse is Congress&#146; only real 

  rein on a president, and abandoning it even temporarily would blow a major hole 

  in our constitutional system of checks and balances that could not easily be 

  repaired.</p>

<p>If you think the country wouldn&#146;t sit still for such a measure, think 

  again. Just look at the exaggerated anthrax scare&#151;after all, as Dr. Ezekiel 

  Emanuel pointed out on the <i>Wall Street Journal</i>&#146;s op-ed page, &#147;280 

  people would have to die of anthrax to equal the risk of driving 50 miles in 

  a car (about one in a million).&#148; Yet Americans are gorging themselves on 

  overpriced Cipro (10 bottles cost $2,100 in New York but only $160 in Mexico), 

  thus leaving the pill-poppers prey to lethal, antibiotic-resistant strains of 

  influenza and other diseases; buying useless gas masks (ineffective without 

  full body suits); and flooding emergency rooms with demands for anthrax tests 

  at the first runny nose.</p>

<p>State and local health systems, the first line of defense against bioterrorism, 

  are already teetering on the edge of collapse, their overworked personnel exhausted 

  to the point of limited competence. If the public has become so deranged at 

  what is, at the moment, a very limited danger, imagine what happens when our 

  citizenry finds out that our country is completely unprepared for the kind of 

  massive deaths the spread of plague or Ebola-type viruses, all airborne, could 

  engender.</p>

<p>The likelihood of Bush being granted sweeping powers will measurably increase 

  when Republicans almost certainly retake both houses of Congress next year during 

  a deepening war with more U.S. casualties. Meanwhile, the rush to shred our 

  civil liberties is unimpeded. The House rejected the compromise anti-terrorism 

  bill that Rep. John Conyers and others managed to engineer in the Judiciary 

  Committee, and substituted for it the much more draconian Senate version, which 

  Tom Daschle helped whip through the Senate with only one dissenting vote&#151;Russ 

  Feingold of Wisconsin. (In the House, only 75 Democrats stood up to oppose the 

  unadulterated Ashcroft package.)</p>

<p>At this point, it is hard to see a way out of the crisis the long war is creating 

  for our democracy. One is reminded of the old Russian proverb: An optimist is 

  only a pessimist who has not yet heard the bad news.
