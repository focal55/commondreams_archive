Why be concerned about (a thing as abstract as) a strong or weak dollar?  
Well, the dollar’s value affects the economy, which, in turn, impacts 
people’s jobs.

<p>On one hand, American manufacturing workers feel the pain of layoffs when 
the high value of the dollar makes what they produce expensive to sell 
overseas.   U.S. manufacturing  (which is not isolated from other domestic 
employment sectors) lost 632,000 jobs in the first seven months of 2001, the 
Bureau of Labor Statistics reported.

<p>On the other hand, the strong dollar valuation makes U.S. imports less 
costly.  Significantly, President Bush and Treasury Secretary O’Neill speak 
differently about a strong or weak dollar.  Taking the longer view can be 
useful here.

<p>Today, foreign exchange markets instead of the U.S. government determine the 
dollar’s value.  The Bush administration thus deals with a different dollar 
than another Republican president did 30 years ago.  Allow me to explain.

<p>President Nixon removed the gold backing from the dollar on August 15, 1971. 
The greenback had been regulated, fixed to the price of gold ($35 an ounce) 
since the end of World War II.  Dollars backed by gold had flooded foreign 
shores, with the Marshall Plan that rebuilt Europe a case in point.

<p>Then, the U.S. was a creditor country.  No longer.  Bush’s U.S. is 
simultaneously the world’s biggest debtor nation and the engine of global 
economic growth.

<p>Nixon’s deregulation of the dollar helped U.S. corporations and financial 
institutions as they lost profits and market share to emerging competitors 
in Europe and Japan during the sunset of postwar affluence.  In “Blues for 
America,” economist Doug Dowd described these events.

<p>He wrote: “The creation by North American, European, and Japanese capital of 
productive forces for durable consumer and capital goods along with a 
rapidly advancing technology was, of course, a major stimulus in the long 
expansion.  By the 1970s the resulting facilities had already become 
seriously duplicative, producing intense competition for critical raw 
materials and for markets, with consequent whipsaw effects.”

<p>The ending of post-war prosperity for working Americans quickened.  What 
economist Richard Du Boff called the “corporate counteroffensive” began to 
restore profitability to U.S. corporate and financial sectors.  Market 
competition intensified and the nation deindustrialized.  Manufacturers 
relocated factories outside the U.S. to boost profits.

<p>Currently, the U.S. auto industry is taking it on the chin.  Bush’s dollar 
policy is harming them.  The strong dollar is no friend of theirs.

<p>Certainly, the value of the dollar is a negative factor.  Yet it is market 
competition itself that creates imbalances between production and 
consumption.  Worldwide, there are too many cars and other goods for too few 
buyers.  Supply and demand is out of whack.  The global market breeds 
instability and fragility, which can appear as currency crises.

<p>Take, for example, the economic breakdowns of the 1990s that included 
currency devaluations in Indonesia, Mexico, Russia, South Korea and 
Thailand.  Crucially, such monetary meltdowns were effects, not causes, of 
unequal relations between these nations and their richer competitors 
(Europe, Japan and the U.S.).  The weaker nations couldn’t repel harm from 
market competition. Europe, Japan and the U.S. could—for a time.

<p>Which brings us to the possibility of a dollar devaluation.  It could lead 
to a flight of dollars now flowing into the U.S.

<p>The U.S. lives large, borrowing $450 billion a year from foreign lenders, or 
some $1.23 billion every 24 hours.  As the slowdown laps against American 
shores, the International Monetary Fund has warned that such a level of 
indebtedness cannot be sustained indefinitely.

<p>Should the U.S. heed the IMF’s advice and reduce its level of foreign 
borrowing?  IMF policy recommendations for nations to get their financial 
houses in order have included firing workers, privatizing public services 
and creating legal systems more favorable to big businesses, corporate and 
foreign investors.

<p>Markets could weaken the value of the dollar.  Much depends on U.S. economic 
growth, corporate profits and share prices.

<p>And as  economist Jim Devine pointed out, the U.S. can repay its global 
debts with dollars. Nations such as South Korea and Thailand couldn’t use 
their currencies to pay foreign lenders.

<p>The U.S. stands alone, so to speak ,as the buyer of last resort for the 
world economy.  That the world’s biggest economy also relies so heavily on 
foreign funds as the global economy slows down has made the IMF go on the 
record with a warning about such huge borrowing.

<p>The Bush administration claims to be fond of market competition.   Will/can 
the president let the market decide the dollar valuation during the 
slowdown?

<p>The ramifications are national and global.  Crucially, policy makers don’t 
have a monopoly on questions and solutions concerning market competition and 
the dollar.  Just ask the people protesting in late September against the 
IMF in Washington, D.C.
