<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 

          State Journal the other Sunday announced it will keep track of W&#146;s 

          campaign promises to see if he keeps them once he takes office.</font>

<P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I 

          think a better idea since he didn&#146;t even win the popular vote is 

          that we watch to make sure he <I>doesn&#146;t </I>keep his campaign 

          promises.</font></P>

<P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According 

          to the exit polling and the results of the vote itself, most Americans 

          don&#146;t want a tax cut that for all practical purposes will do away 

          with our chance to pay down the national debt. They don&#146;t want 

          Supreme Court justices appointed who will send women back to the underground 

          and have them resort to coat hangers to end unwanted pregnancies.</font></P>

<P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">They 

          don&#146;t want the Social Security system jeopardized by scheming with 

          Wall Street to invest the elderly&#146;s money. Which, incidentally, 

          did better this past year &#151; the Social Security system or the NASDAQ? 

          Social Security still made money for the nation&#146;s pensioners while 

          paying out billions to the permanently disabled and to dependent children 

          who lost a working parent.</font></P>

<P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Most 

          Americans don&#146;t want to see the exploitation of one of the last 

          remaining pristine wilderness areas in Alaska, nor do they want taxpayers&#146; 

          money funneled into private schools. So, with any luck at all, W won&#146;t 

          keep his campaign promises.</font></P>

<P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">An 

          e-mail came the other day from a self-proclaimed &quot;free-marketer&quot; 

          who took issue with my contention that the energy crisis in California 

          proves that utility deregulation is a farce.</font></P>

<P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">You 

          didn&#146;t point out, the man said, that California only deregulated 

          the power generation and not the prices that utilities charge the consumers. 

          That would make it better?</font></P>

<P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Let&#146;s 

          see now ... California votes to deregulate the generation of power ... 

          the utilities spin off the power plants ... the new deregulated power 

          plant owners now find they can raise the price for the power they produce 

          by 900 percent.</font></P>

<P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Had 

          California taken the next step and deregulated consumer costs, too, 

          then the utilities could pass on all the 900 percent to the consumer.</font></P>

<P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Wouldn&#146;t 

          that be just peachy?</font></P>

<P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Revenues 

          to the power plants and the utilities would be allowed to jump 900 percent 

          while the hapless homeowner pays nine times his or her normal bill.</font></P>

<P align="left">

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

It&#146;s 

          fine the way it is now. Let the utilities squirm a bit. This was all 

          their idea in the first place.
