After this week&#146;s campaign finance debate is done and after 

              the coming battles over George W. Bush&#146;s tax plan, Congress 

              will gear up for 2001&#146;s most serious policy fight.

<P>Working in conjunction with the corporate interests that so generously 

              funded his presidential campaign, Bush will seek "fast-track" authority 

              to negotiate the Free Trade Agreement of the Americas &#151; a sweeping 

              expansion of the North American Free Trade Agreement designed to 

              create a corporate free-trade zone from Tierra del Fuego to the 

              Arctic.</P>

<P>The product of business and government collusion to limit the ability 

              of citizens to protect workers and the environment through regulation 

              of multinational firms, this is classic globalization from above. 

              Corporate public relations machines will spend millions to convince 

              Congress that free trade opens markets for goods produced by American 

              workers and farmers, while at the same time raising the standard 

              of living for the farmers and workers of developing countries.</P>

<P>If that argument is to be exposed for the lie that it is, the authentic 

              voice of the working poor in the United States and Latin America 

              will have to be heard. That&#146;s an uncommon phenomenon in any 

              debate, but it may just happen this year &#151; thanks to the remarkable 

              cross-border solidarity work of the U.S./El Salvador Sister Cities 

              network, of which the Madison-Arcatao Sister City Project is a member 

              and prime mover.</P>

<P>The network has for many years worked closely with the Association 

              of Rural Communities for the Development of El Salvador (CRIPDES), 

              one of Latin America&#146;s most effective grass-roots organizations. 

              CRIPDES has long been in the forefront of battles against privatization 

              of public services, dislocation of farmers, development of a sweatshop 

              economy and other manifestations of corporate globalization, and 

              the group&#146;s president, Lorena Martinez, is a highly articulate 

              critic of free-trade agreements.</P>

<P>Over the weekend, the U.S./El Salvador Sister Cities brought Martinez 

              together in Chicago with Cheri Honkala, executive director of Philadelphia&#146;s 

              Kensington Welfare Rights Union. Honkala has been in the forefront 

              of campaigns to prevent the factory closures, privatizations and 

              evictions that have been the manifestations of corporate globalization 

              in U.S. cities.</P>

<P>Martinez and Honkala have decided to link their groups in a sistering 

              relationship. And, though their resources are few, they plan to 

              work with U.S./El Salvador Sister Cities and other activist groups 

              to deliver the message that globalization from above is no good 

              for poor people in the United States or Salvador.</P>

<P>"We call it globalization from below," says Honkala.</P>

<P>"Usually, they try to play poor people against one another," adds 

              Martinez. "But when poor people in the United States and the people 

              in El Salvador both say, &#145;This is no good for us,&#146; then 

              it leads people to ask, &#145;Who is the Free Trade Agreement of 

              the Americas good for?&#146; The answer, of course, is that it is 

              good only for those who would exploit us."

<P><i>Salvadoran leader Lorena Martinez will join Madison Arcatao Sister City Project members at a public forum at 7 p.m. today at St. Rafael Cathedral, 222 W. Main, Madison. The event is free and open to the public. </i>
