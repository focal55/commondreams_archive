<p>The other side of the record incarceration rate that has made this country

the world's leading jailer is the record number of inmates getting out of

jail. Never before has America had to deal with so many ex-cons. This presents

a problem of social reintegration; prisons these days are more concerned with

punishment than rehabilitation, so former inmates are returning to society

with fewer skills than ever.

<P>

   For African-Americans, who are imprisoned disproportionately, the problems

are multiplied. Not only are more black ex-inmates headed home, they generally

return to the same inner-city neighborhoods where their concentrated numbers

can easily overwhelm communities already crippled by a lack of jobs and

resources. This is a formula for catastrophe but no one seems to be noticing.

<P>



Kublai Toure has been noticing. As executive director of an organization

called Amer-I-Can, the 52-year-old Toure has been trying to intervene into

this dismal cycle that wastes the lives of so many African-American youth. For

much of his adult life he has tackled the problem in various ways. But in the

last four years he has worked with so-called "at-risk" youth within the Cook

County Juvenile Detention Center, through his group.

<P>

   Amer-I-Can is the brainchild of Jim Brown, former National Football League

player and movie actor. It is designed to teach inmates ways to empower

themselves through training in life-management skills. The program is in

operation in 13 states across the country, funded primarily by local agencies,

and generally is well regarded. Toure has been involved with Amer-I-Can

Illinois since 1991.

<P>

   It now appears the group will lose its county funding because Toure made

the mistake of hiring a counselor who allegedly was active in a West Side

gang. Elbert "Pierre" Mahoney, who was slain in a gang-related murder on the

West Side Sept. 29, was working for Amer-I-Can.

<P>

   It's easy to understand Toure's dilemma. The record numbers of returning

ex-cons have little in common with traditional black leadership. In fact, for

cultural and economic reasons, civil-rights organizations and social-service

agencies tend to alienate many former inmates. Many inmates respond only to a

leadership they trust, that speaks their language.

<P>

   But that language is threatening to many, and not just to "law-and-order"

types, who reflexively belittle any attempt to rehabilitate wayward youth.

Traditional black leaders also seem a bit threatened by the rough-hewn

leadership emerging to deal with the byproducts of our incarceration epidemic.

Toure candidly admits his mistake in hiring Mahoney without getting a go-ahead

from his board of directors. But he also argues that the program shouldn't

suffer because of one mistake. "I knew he was on the edge but he was really

respected by the youth in the program," he said. "I caught him at the

crossroad of his life and I thought he had crossed over already, but

apparently he hadn't."

<P>

   Many credit Toure, who also served eight years as a Chicago firefighter,

for helping to convince warring gang factions or "nations" to put down their

weapons and stop shooting at each other during the gang-truce movement of the

early 1990s. "I got involved in all that diplomacy stuff after my stepson was

killed in 1991 in a mistaken-identity attack," he explained. He credits the

social consciousness triggered by leaders like Malcolm X and a late local

leader named Al Hajj Lukman with forging his sense of commitment.

<P>

   Toure is one of many leaders around the country who are stepping up to the

plate to confront the growing crisis provoked by the increasingly invasive

"corrections industrial complex." In October, the Sentencing Project, a

criminal justice-reform and research group, reported that the U.S., with 690

prisoners per 100,000 population, has officially surpassed Russia as the

world's leader in the rate of incarceration. From about 330,000 inmates in

prison and jail in 1972, the inmate population grew to 2 million in 2000. "In

comparison to other industrialized nations, the U.S. rate of incarceration is

five to eight times that of Canada and most of western Europe," according to

the Sentencing Project. While Americans don't seem too bothered by this global

ignominy, other countries feel our pain. We got a flash of their concern when

Stanley "Tookie" Williams, the incarcerated co-founder of the infamous Los

Angeles Crips, was nominated for a 2001 Nobel Peace Prize. Williams is an

inmate on San Quentin's Death Row who has written books and designed programs

that offer hope to those trapped in criminal lifestyles.

<P>

   Perhaps that jarring nomination will force Americans to look for leadership

in new places. Toure certainly hopes so.
