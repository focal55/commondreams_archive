A new international order may not have emerged from the cauldron of 11 September, 

but it is not too early to discern the outlines of the emerging world. 

<P>September did not change everything: the map of the world, the global pattern 

of economic and military power, the relative distribution of democratic, semi-authoritarian 

and tyrannical states remains much the same. Many of the problems which are least 

susceptible to traditional forms of state control (the environment, migration, 

the drugs trade, Aids) long predated 11 September. 

<P>Yet this recognition of continuity downplays the degree to which the attacks 

on the US 'homeland' have reshaped, or promise to reshape, our world. First, there 

has been a marked increase in the focus and assertion of United States power. 

The US was, prior to 11 September, the dominant world power in every significant 

index. Yet it was uncertain as to how to exert this, wavering between a multilateral 

approach, tenaciously pursued by the Clinton administration, and the unilateral 

- which is not the same as the isolationist - policy favored by Bush. The signs 

of that unilateralism were evident enough in the first few months: rejection of 

Kyoto, stalling on OECD regulation of tax havens, sliding out of chemical warfare 

conventions, NMD, sneering at the UN, to name a few. 

<P>The events of 11 September have forced the Bush administration to reverse some 

of these policies and stall on others. But in two important ways there has been 

major change. Within the US, the crisis has produced a radical strengthening of 

the power of the President: no leader in US history, with the possible exception 

of Roosevelt in wartime, has had the control over Congress, his own party, the 

military establishment, and public opinion that Bush enjoys. Inept on his feet 

he may be, but the US President does know how to build a coalition and that is 

what he has done at executive and political levels. 

<P>At the same time the crisis has led much of the rest of the world to work more 

closely with the US. When the call for co-operation from Washington comes, it 

has proven hard to refuse. Here lies the second of the great changes brought about 

by 11 September: some US allies, notably Saudi Arabia, have moved further away, 

but the overall diplomatic balance sheet has been to America's advantage. 

<P>Russia has, with its own benefits in mind, consolidated a strategic and political 

collaboration with Washington: it has given the green light to a temporary stationing 

of US forces in Central Asia, and is offering itself as a long-term partner in 

the energy market, an alternative to the unreliable Persian Gulf. China, too, 

to the alarm of some in the Middle East, who look to it as the only permanent 

member of the Security Council not to have a colonial past, joined the counter-terrorist 

campaign. Germany and Japan have, in some measure, sloughed off their post-1945 

pacifism. 

<P>Against this, however, lies the third of the outcomes of 11 September, the 

consolidation, to a degree latent but not present before that date, of a global 

coalition of anti-US sentiment. Just as US liberal writers have talked in the 

1990s of the importance for US dominance of 'soft' power - in media, language, 

lifestyle, technology - so the opposition to US power is forming above all in 

this domain. 

<P>This has highlighted a change in the nature of power in the modern world. The 

basis of much orthodox international relations theory is the concept 'balance 

of power': this means not an equal distribution of power, but a self-correcting 

mechanism, whereby, if one state becomes too strong, others form a countervailing 

alliance. 

<P>This version of balance of power did not work in the period since the end of 

the Cold War: there was no countervailing bloc. Rather, everyone seemed to 'bandwagon', 

to join the US bloc and its associated international institutions like NATO and 

the WTO. 

<P>However, if states bandwagon, popular opinion does not necessarily follow. 

At the level of popular feeling, and not just in the Muslim world, a countervailing 

balance is taking shape. Hence the opposition of much of Latin America to support 

for the US campaign, widespread objections in East Asia and in, normally anti-Muslim, 

India. 

<P>These shifts in the distribution and character of power are compounded by changes 

in the management of the global economy; 11 September has depressed certain important 

sectors of the market - airlines, tourism, oil, insurance. It has diffused a wider 

lack of confidence on the part of investors and consumers, accentuating the trend 

towards recession. It has pushed down global demand for oil - there is now surplus 

capacity. This has precipitated not only a fall in oil prices, but also led to 

a price war between OPEC and the main non-OPEC producers. 

<P>There is renewed concern to reduce dependence on oil from the Gulf - the site 

of two thirds of the world's reserves, but now felt to be a region of enduring 

instability. Non-Gulf producers, notably Russia, the Caspian states and Venezuela, 

are pressing their case. 

<P>The most important economic shift is that, above all, 11 September has brought 

the state - and not least the US state - back into the management of the world 

economy: neo-liberal faith in the market, already frayed, has now been further 

eroded as governments promise to subsidize ailing sectors, use fiscal adjustment 

and lower interest rates to offset the crisis. One open question is how all this 

will affect the euro changeover next January: the stability pact is already under 

pressure, and George Bush is not likely to worry about what happens to this rival 

to the dollar. 

<P>Some of the changes that have become evident since 11 September were already 

incipient: the assertion of US power by Bush, the rhetoric of cultural conflict, 

a resiling from a commitment to universal standards on human rights, intervention 

by OECD states to offset an anticipated recession. Yet that date marks a rupture 

in modern history. It takes years to assess the consequences of major earthquakes: 

11 September will be no exception. The broader seismic impact can, however, be 

discerned.
