Opponents of affirmative action--the ones who believe that this

country is committed to equal opportunity based on pure merit--are

unhappy with last week's decision by the University of California regents

ending the ban on affirmative action in the UC system.

<p>Although I agree with the regents' decision, I invite the opponents to

join me in fighting another form of discrimination in admissions: the

practice of relaxing standards to admit the scions of large donors.

Fighting against these "wealth preferences" should be philosophically

consistent with the anti-affirmative action position that admissions

should be based entirely on merit. After all, what merit is there simply

in having been born into a wealthy family?

<p>Perhaps not surprisingly, the anti-affirmative action folks have not

raised the cry against wealth preferences. But why should affirmative

action for the wealthy be considered less objectionable than policies

that would give traditionally underrepresented groups an advantage in

getting into prestigious institutions? I would think the distinction cuts

the other way.

<p>First, unlike minority students, wealthy kids generally have not been

educated in some of the nation's worst secondary schools. Indeed, there

is an almost a 100% correlation between having lots of money and

attending really good high schools. There is therefore no need to adjust

admissions standards to give these kids an edge just because their

parents are wealthy.

<p>Second, unlike affirmative action for minorities, wealth preferences

cannot be defended on the grounds that wealthy students have suffered a

history of discrimination and/or continue to suffer the effects of a

demoralizing stigmatization. Who ever heard of a prestigious institution

where the wealthy had been systematically excluded? Who ever heard of

"wealth profiling"?

<p>Third, wealth preferences cannot be justified on the grounds that

admission to the nation's best schools would help assure that all groups

have access to the highest echelons of corporate power. After all, right

there in the highest corridors of power are the wealthy kids' very own

parents.

<p>It's interesting that the opponents of affirmative action are often

the same people who, rather than being committed to leveling playing

fields for all, are committed to enhancing the advantages of wealth,

i.e., eliminating the estate tax and reducing the progressiveness of the

tax code. So, again, I am asking: Are the arguments against affirmative

action really based on lofty notions of equal opportunity, or are they

based on protecting the existing privileges of those who need it the

least?
