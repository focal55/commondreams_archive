 Timothy McVeigh reportedly believes there are ideas worth killing for.

That's why, in 1995, he ignited a bomb that killed 168 people and injured

hundreds more. The federal government will help him make his point by killing

him.

<P>

   Due to an FBI screw-up, in which the agency withheld many pieces of

evidence from his defense lawyers, McVeigh will not be slain as scheduled on

May 16. But few doubt that he eventually will be sent to meet his maker by the

people's executioner.

<P>



His death will continue the barbaric practice this country resumed in 1976

when it re-instituted the death penalty. The state has killed 712 people in

our name since that time. McVeigh will be the 30th inmate executed this year

and the first federal prisoner in 38 years. The last public execution occurred

in Missouri in 1937, when Roscoe "Red" Jackson was hanged for murder. The

event provoked such a circus atmosphere, it led to the end of public

executions.

<P>

   According to the book "American Terrorist: Timothy McVeigh and the Oklahoma

City Bombing," McVeigh wreaked his slaughter in an idealistic attempt to

avenge the 80 or so Branch Davidians who died in Waco, Texas, and the two

survivalists who died in Ruby Ridge, Idaho, all at the hands of federal

agents. This belief that some metaphysical scorekeeper is noting deaths on

each side of the moral ledger is magical thinking at it's most primitive. But

the federal government uses precisely the same kind of primitive thinking by

putting him to death.

<P>

   Since capital punishment does not deter crime, insure equal justice or

facilitate domestic tranquility, its sole purpose is to provide a public

expression of vengeance. However, the recognition that justice and vengeance

are often unrelated provides the reason societies must develop judicial

systems.Thus, the idea of capital punishment is subversive to the logic of

criminal justice.

<P>

   Murdering miscreants only makes sense if one subscribes to McVeigh's

magical thinking that it will balance a spiritual scorecard in eternity.

<P>

   For McVeigh and those of his ideological ilk, protecting Americans from

governmental abuse is akin to a spiritual crusade and an idea worth killing

for. Indeed, the bombing sparked a flurry of stories and reports about a

growing militia movement of "angry white men" in camouflage uniforms with

combat on their minds.

<P>

   These men had political as well as religious justifications for their

hatred of the U.S. government, and their grievances had ominous echoes in the

political system. The Republican takeover of Congress in 1994 was one symptom

of what seemed to be growing discontent.

<P>

   McVeigh himself was a Gulf War veteran who became well versed in the

militarized logic of warfare. His use of the term "collateral damage" to

describe the deaths of 19 children who died in the April 19, 1995 blast eerily

echoes the Pentagon's use of that term to dismiss civilians deaths in its

varied bombing campaigns.

<P>

   McVeigh's experience in the U.S. armed forces taught him well that superior

armaments were more important than superior arguments when confronting

America's enemies-- and he considers the federal government a lethal enemy.

<P>

   Another unlearned lesson of the McVeigh case is the way in which the

militarized logic he embodies is seeping into American culture. It is

particularly evident in the criminal justice system, where the escalating

"wars" on drugs and crime are more than just a metaphorical embrace of the

term. Police increasingly are adopting combat-zone strategies to cope with

domestic situations. But that's another problem for another time.

<P>

   McVeigh made his mark by carrying out the most deadly terrorist act in the

nation's history because he believed the abuses of the federal government were

worth killing for. His ideas about governmental abuse were more important to

him than human lives.

<P>

   The state--in our names--also kills for an idea. When death penalty

opponents argue that it is merely a revenge ritual, capital punishers counter

that they are not concerned with revenge, but an expression of society's

highest values. We commit premeditated murder to nurture the notion that

certain behavior is worthy of death.

<P>

   Rather than using McVeigh's murderous behavior to note the pitfalls in the

notion that certain ideas are worthy of murder, the government will deepen the

cycle of violence by confirming the notion.
