The lyric that is haunting these red white and blue days is from a Simon

and Garfunkel song that could be a national anthem.  The lyric is “….all

gone to look for America.” Or is it “...all come to look for America.”

It works either way. America is a search you can arrive to or leave for.

The essence and definition of America is elusive and varied but the

pursuits America allows – the lessons learned as you comb all the

aspects and promise of this Utopian innovation - is the point.

Immigrants arrive and expatriates leave but all come and go to look for

America.



<p>Some resident Americans were surprised recently that many in the

international community had doubts about the compromised condition of

the great adventure of America. It had been a country in love with

redemption. It had turned wretched and disenfranchised citizens of the

world into the creators and inventors of new epochs. Individuals, by

virtue of talent and passion, redefined the notion of royalty and

birthright. That has been America and that is what all eyes have been on

for two hundred years.



<p>As with all adventures there are dark linings to be sure. But the voices

of Thoreau, Emerson, Whitman and King among many other original voices

trumped and challenged those dark linings. The American voices that need

to challenge us are now muffled and mocked. There is the insidious white

noise of a self-interested media that gets its marching orders from the

same dark linings that need to be challenged. It also has a lot of

product to push toward our patriotic consumption. And there are those

Americans who wonder if there are other patriotic gestures we can try

besides consumption.



<p>So that lyric keeps playing – “to look for America.” It’s provocative

and enigmatic and accurate. America invites and allows an individual to

search – to be bold – and to be wrong. In being wrong or in being at

odds with the mainstream there is a great opportunity to discover

avenues of evolution. To block the blessed mess of the free trade of

ideas and rhetoric is un-American. To see boundaries as hurdles that

challenge the intellectual and spiritual muscularity of the citizens

that are contained by those boundaries, is the nucleus of America. Mess

with that DNA and you’ve lost the species that the world has been

evolving to for centuries. And the gifts America has to offer are just

starting.



<p>American artists, performers and inventors launch themselves from a

tradition of citizens un-intimidated by uncharted waters. Uncharted

waters are what irrigated the foundation of America. (It’s ironic that

America got its name from a man who mapped the borders of the Western

continents.)  But the search for America is the search for what’s next.

It’s the energy of swimming to the curve of a peaking wave. To freeze

that urge – to stop the desire to look for America and to have it become

a static monolithic agreeable drug is the opposite of American

patriotism. To tame the citizens and to harness them with propaganda and

mind-numbing bromides and platitudes is the great act of treason. In

other words, Lynne Cheney should be brought in for questioning – George

should be put under tight surveillance – and John Ashcroft needs to

apply for citizenship.



<p>Our present national anthem is hard to sing – it has rockets glaring and

bombs bursting in air - but the last climactic line “land of the free

and the home of the brave” is worth looking at in light of the

unofficial national anthem’s suggestion: “Land of the free” meaning we

are free to – obey – shop – think – criticize – protest –leave – return

– create - invent – to name a few choices. “Home of the brave” - brave

meaning we will fight? – We will fly bombers?  We will drop bombs?  Or

brave meaning to dare – to forge new realities – to risk failure – to

risk rejection – to risk peace - to say the unpopular thing – to

proclaim the country you want to participate in – brave enough to reject

the simplistic slogans that we are fed intravenously and therefore brave

enough – and free enough - to look for America.
