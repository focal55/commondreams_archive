THERE WAS an unintentionally ironic moment Monday as CNN's veteran news 

anchor, Aaron Brown, reacted to live footage of grieving relatives who'd come 

to Las American International airport in Santo Domingo to meet American 

Airlines Flight 587.

<P>Said Brown, "This is so painful to watch."

<P>Funny, I've been thinking the same thing of late about CNN itself.

<P>Between the September 11 terrorist attacks and the so-called war in 

Afghanistan, a once-great news operation seems to be morphing into the Atlanta-

based annex of the West Wing -- the real one in the White House, not the Emmy-

winning series on CBS.

<P>Although CNN anchors and reporters have not yet joined their counterparts 

at Fox in wearing American flag lapel pins, the network of Walter Isaacson 

seems more like Spin City than the network of Ted Turner -- the one place you 

knew you could trust to deliver all the unadulterated facts.

<P>Why, there's even a "War Room" in Washington where Wolf Blitzer (who, 

surely to God, is a little embarrassed at the pretentiousness) can talk 

strategy with CNN's military analyst in Georgia, Major-General Don Shepperd. A 

lanky, amiable man with a penchant for easy-to-grasp analogies, Shepperd wears 

a business suit instead of his Air Force general's uniform, but his 

instinctive use of "we" makes the "retired" part of his rank a mere formality.

<P>The day after the crash of Flight 587, Blitzer in his War Room and Shepperd 

amid his 3-D landscape of the Middle East, were in high demand at CNN. Our new 

best friends, the Northern Alliance, had strolled against orders into Kabul -- 

What else could they do? Someone had to provide "security" -- and there was 

much cheering and dancing in the streets.

<P>While CNN's maddening bottom-scroll carried such news items as "Fashion 

editor-turned-Old Navy pitchwoman Carrie Donovan dies at 73", Gen. Shepperd 

stood with reporter Joie Chen on the Arabian Sea and used his pool-cue-length 

pointer to track the retreating Taliban.

<P>"Think of this as Denver, Colo.," he said, tapping on Kabul, "and this 

(Kandahar) as all those ski areas up in the Rocky Mountains."

<P>Sharing the split screen with Shepperd and Chen were shots of bloodied 

bodies -- none in military uniform -- laid out on a dusty Afghan road. The 

accompanying footage then turned to an Afghan gent repeatedly kicking a dead 

man's head as if it were a soccer ball that had gotten stuck to a human torso. 

Shepperd's earlier observation that "this is not a good day to be a Taliban" 

took on even deeper meaning.

<P>In an article last week about the post-September-11 ratings rise in this 

country of BBC World News, Caryn James of the New York Times wrote: ". . .

after two months, American television's cautious approach has turned into knee-

jerk pandering to the public, reflecting a mood of patriotism rather than 

informing viewers of the complex, sometimes harsh realities they need to know."

<P>Not surprising, the U.S. commander-in-chief seems not to agree. Tuesday, 

during his White House press conference with Russian President Vladimir Putin, 

George W. Bush heaped praise upon the entire U.S. news media, which he 

admitted he had "been trying to tame ever since I got into politics."

<P>Having "failed miserably" to do that, he said, he could declare that "the 

press in America has never been stronger and more vibrant."

<P>No doubt that brought satisfied smiles all around the CNN War Room.
