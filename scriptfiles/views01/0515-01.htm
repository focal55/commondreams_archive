How many times can the most powerful

financial institution in the world -- the International

Monetary Fund -- make the same mistake? The

answer seems to be: as many times as it wants to.

As Argentina teeters on the brink of defaulting on

its $150 billion foreign debt, and finance minister

Domingo Cavallo jets all over the world trying to

convince the financial markets that the inevitable is

not going to happen, there is an eerie familiarity to

the whole sequence of events.



         <p>Think back to November 1998: Brazil's

currency was highly overvalued and most

economists expected the peg -- its fixed exchange

rate against the dollar -- to collapse. Enter the IMF,

arranging a "rescue" package of $42 billion in

loans, and its usual application of leeches to bleed

the patient: sky-high interest rates and budget cuts,

guaranteed to slow the economy and put the burden

of "adjustment" on the poor.



         <p>Within two months the Brazilian real had

collapsed anyway, leaving the country with nothing

to show for the IMF plan but a pile of foreign debt

and a stagnating economy.



         <p>Argentina may be headed for a similar fate.

The Argentines pegged their currency to the dollar a

decade ago, and the move is widely credited with

helping to end an era of high inflation.



         <p>But there are disadvantages to a fixed

exchange rate, and Argentina has come to see the

worst of them in the last few years. As the US dollar

rose in value the Argentine peso had to rise in step

with it. When the Fed raised interest rates in the

United States, Argentine interest rates had to go up

too, even with their economy already in a slump.

When Brazil's currency collapsed, it made

Argentina's exports to that country inaccessibly

expensive.



         <p>It all adds up to a finance minister's worst

nightmare: an overvalued currency and a fixed

exchange rate that many investors believe cannot

hold. The country must borrow at ever higher

interest rates, because of the increasing risks of both

currency collapse and default on the foreign debt.

And as the country borrows more, these risks

increase. Argentina now has debt service that is

approaching its total export earnings.



         <p>The IMF's role in Argentina, as in similar

situations, is not helpful. First, they act as "enabler"

for the loan-addicted government, providing

enormous loans to prop up the currency. Some of

the better-connected and wealthier investors are

thus able to get their money out before the

inevitable collapse, or even worse, to make a

fortune by speculating against the domestic

currency.



<p>The IMF argues that to let the currency fall

would risk a return to hyperinflation. But no such

thing happened after the Brazilian real collapsed.

And for the Russian ruble in 1998, where the Fund

also wasted billions and bled the economy in order

to prop up an overvalued currency, the result of the

currency's collapse was even more favorable. Not

only was the ensuing inflation easily manageable,

the economy has since registered its highest real

growth in two decades.



         <p>All this is consistent with standard economic

theory. We would not expect terrible inflation from

a currency devaluation in a country where imports

are a relatively small fraction of the economy (about

11 percent in Argentina, 7 percent in Brazil). A

devaluation of the domestic currency is often the

best solution in these situations: it makes the

country's exports cheaper and its imports more

expensive, thus improving the trade balance and

stimulating growth.



         <p>The Fund also plays another destabilizing

role in these crises, by setting targets that the

country's government must meet in order to

"reassure financial markets." But these targets may

be politically difficult to meet -- as well as

unnecessary or even harmful to the economy.



<p>And when the country fails to do what it is

told, the crisis worsens. In Argentina's case the

government budget deficit target for 2001 has been

increased from less than 1 percent, to now 2.3

percent of GDP. These are very tight constraints for

an economy in the midst of a long recession: for

comparison, the US ran a budget deficit of 4.6

percent of GDP during our last recession (1991),

and 6.1% coming out the previous, deeper recession

(1983).



         <p>One year ago the Meltzer Commission, a bi-

partisan Congressional panel appointed to review

the IMF's practices, recommended a number of

steps to downsize this institution, and reduce the

likelihood of these repeated and often disastrous

economic failures. Maybe it is time to put some of

these reforms in place.
