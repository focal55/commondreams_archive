If little else, the stock market meltdown has been good for one 

              thing: It&#146;s cooled the fervor to stick Social Security funds 

              into the stock market.

<P>For sure, W and his let&#146;s-turn-everything-over-to-big-business 

              gang haven&#146;t given up the silly idea to privatize part of the 

              Social Security system, but the American public is having serious 

              doubts.</P>

<P>And if the people say leave Social Security alone, that&#146;s 

              going to make it tougher for this administration to turn over the 

              most successful program in American governmental history to the 

              money changers on Wall Street.</P>

<P>What the past couple of months have shown, of course, is that the 

              stock market isn&#146;t a never-ending 20 percent per year ride 

              to riches. It can also be a 20 percent per year &#151; or 30 or 

              40 percent &#151; ride to the poorhouse.</P>

<P>And while everything from the dot-coms to the blue chips tumbled 

              last year and are performing even worse so far this year, the government&#146;s 

              Social Security system continues to earn its 3 percent or 4 percent 

              and serve as an insurance policy for millions of widows and orphans 

              and disabled folks throughout the United States.</P>

<P>That&#146;s what so many critics of Social Security forget. Bush 

              and his cronies try to portray the system as a pension plan, equating 

              it with private 401(k)s and other pension funds. It was never intended 

              to be that. Instead, it was designed to provide at least a minimum 

              of benefits so that the nation&#146;s elderly could pay their living 

              essentials without fear of being thrown into the poorhouse.</P>

<P>It was also designed &#151; and tweaked through the years &#151; 

              to give widows of wage earners and their children at least enough 

              funds to get by. And if a worker should become permanently disabled 

              before he or she reaches 65, there&#146;s enough of a benefit for 

              that person to pay the rent and buy food.</P>

<P>The beauty of it all &#151; and the main reason for its unprecedented 

              success despite the economy&#146;s ups and downs &#150; is that 

              the cost is shared by everyone who works. It&#146;s a compact we 

              all have with each other and it&#146;s not based on the greed and 

              utter lunacy that dictate the stock markets.</P>

<P>Certainly, some don&#146;t collect all they&#146;ve contributed 

              because they die early. Others, however, collect much more because 

              they live longer. It&#146;s the same as an insurance policy. If 

              the house burns down, we collect on our homeowner&#146;s policy. 

              If it doesn&#146;t &#151; thank goodness &#151; we&#146;re out our 

              premiums.</P>

<P>Start tinkering with the system and we&#146;ll soon destroy it.</P>

<P>What, for example, if you were turning 65 this month and a goodly 

              percentage of your Social Security benefit was in the stock market? 

              Must you take less if you retire? Or will the rest of the system 

              be forced to subsidize the pension you would have otherwise received? 

              How long can a system survive with that kind of strain on its finances?</P>

<P>Let&#146;s learn from this latest &#151; and there will be many 

              more, to be sure &#151; lesson from the stock market and leave Social 

              Security alone.
