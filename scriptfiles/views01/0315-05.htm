When the Ameritrade company launched a $200 million marketing 

drive to explain the joys of online trading in autumn 1999, a barrage of TV 

commercials invited viewers to join in the fun. The news was bullish, and 

the firm's motto -- "Believe in yourself" -- provided an upbeat message. 

Tech stocks led advances in self-affirmation.



         <p>A senior vice president at Ameritrade proclaimed that online 

investing "empowers individuals to take control of their financial lives." 

Within several months, the Nasdaq composite index nearly doubled. When 

spring 2000 began, plenty of satisfied new customers were glad to be 

playing the click-and-invest game.



         <p>Now, four seasons later, the Nasdaq is less than half of where it 

was. Losses have been particularly devastating for many of the investors 

who'd found the get-with-it advertisements and other media hype too 

irresistible to resist a year ago.



         <p>These days, the online trading commercials are on television with 

less frequency and less exuberance. They seem to be more targeted at 

long-term professional investors. Meanwhile, journalists speak ruefully, 

sometimes in morose tones, about the digital gold that has turned to 

silicon ashes in the mouths of America's stock-buying public.



         <p>Sure, "caveat emptor" and all that. Everyone should have known the 

risks. The same can be said for millions of consumers who have let smiley 

cigarette advertisements coax them into smoking. But if the online trading 

ads carried any warning labels at all, they were in very small print.



        <p> On a daily basis, CNN's "Moneyline" and many other national TV 

programs stoked the buying frenzy. It was all quite lucrative -- bringing 

in record levels of commissions for brokerage houses and high ratings for 

market-fixated network shows. Only spoilsports warned that disaster loomed, 

and they didn't get nearly as much air time as the boosters.



         <p>Today, news reports tell about formerly soaring dot-com executives 

who have seen their multimillions (or billions) turn into Nasdaq rubble. 

Even in burned-out condition, the stars of cyberspace get plenty of media 

attention. Less common are the stories that focus on rank-and-file 

investors who lost most of their life's savings.



         <p>We still aren't getting much coverage of some grim details. For 

instance: How were so many people drawn in by the warm-and-cuddly images of 

investment-by-mouse as a means to financial security and personal glory? 

What was it about the prevailing media environment that persuaded millions 

of Americans to put money they couldn't afford to lose into high-tech 

stocks that were incapable of sustaining vastly inflated share prices?



         <p>Eighteen months ago, Ameritrade was boasting in a news release 

that its huge ad blitz would go after every sector of society: "The 

campaign's target audience is more psychographic than demographic, cutting 

across all ages, races, professions and income levels."



         <p>All "income levels" included people with close to zero disposable 

income. The online brokerage firms proved adept at separating a lot of 

those individuals from their money.



         <p>Whatever their economic class, many in the cross hairs stood to 

forfeit more than dollars. To the extent that they bought into ad pitches 

and broader media mania for online trading, people were also vulnerable to 

bait-and-switch tactics that manipulated insecurities in the realm of 

self-esteem. With stocks climbing, a slogan like "Believe in yourself" was 

apt to seem like a welcome boost, a pat on the back. But when self-regard 

is pegged to stock prices, what happens when the market tanks?



        <p> Embedded in the ostensible affirmation was a much less humanistic 

message: Believe in wealth. And no matter where the market is headed, 

that's a message that ends up doing enormous damage -- inflicted with the 

help of ongoing media themes -- portraying a person's capital buildup as a 

key indicator of worth as a human being.





         <p>Let's face it: From splashy magazine features to commercials and 

entertainment shows on television to laudatory news profiles of 

venture-capitalist billionaires, mass media outlets are frequently touting 

the accumulation of financial assets as the pinnacle of achievement.



         <p>Viewed from another planet, the basic character of these dominant 

media values would be clear. But we're accustomed to this constant 

propaganda. We're encouraged to think it's normal. And the costs -- for 

individuals and for our society -- go well beyond any losses in the stock 

market.
