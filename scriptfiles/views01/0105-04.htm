PRESIDENT-ELECT George W. Bush didn't talk about his anti-choice 

record on the campaign trail. In fact, Bush dismissed the "abortion" issue 

altogether, casually telling reporters that good people can disagree on this 

issue.

<P>  But with the announcement of two key cabinet appointments, Sen. John 

Ashcroft as attorney general and Wisconsin Gov. Tommy Thompson as secretary of 

Health and Human Services, the president-elect is speaking loud and clear: 

Policies regarding reproductive health and rights are about to take a new 

direction.

</P>

<P>  Bush's selection of Ashcroft is disturbing given Ashcroft's solid anti-

choice voting record in the Senate. He not only voted to overturn Roe vs. Wade,

</P>

<P>he took leadership positions on a number of anti-choice measures, earning him 

a "0" rating on choice from the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights 

Action League.

</P>

<P>  As attorney general, Ashcroft will have significant responsibility for a 

broad range of reproductive rights issues, including the enforcement of the 

Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act, passed in 1994. That law has 

resulted in the criminal prosecution of persons responsible for terrorizing 

doctors who perform abortion and clinics providing reproductive health 

services.

</P>

<P>  As governor, Bush opposed legislation to protect women and doctors from 

violence at reproductive health care facilities. So pro-choice advocates have 

no confidence that the act will be vigorously enforced under a Bush 

administration.

</P>

<P>  Bush's nomination of Tommy Thompson as secretary of Health and Human 

Services is equally disturbing.

</P>

<P>  Thompson has said that abortions should be illegal except when pregnancy is 

a result of rape, incest, or life endangerment. He also signed legislation 

that prohibits the use of state, local, or federal monies for family planning 

and pregnancy-related programs, if those programs carry out any abortion-

related activities.

</P>

<P>  As secretary of Health and Human Services, Thompson would oversee Title X, 

the nation's oldest family planning program, which serves approximately 4.5 

million women, many of whom are young and poor and depend exclusively upon 

Title X clinics for services. Moreover, Thompson would oversee the U.S. 

Surgeon General, and the commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration 

which regulates mifepristone, formerly RU-486.

</P>

<P>  These two appointments are not the only danger signs. Vice President-elect 

Dick Cheney has his own anti-choice record. As a Congressman, out of 27 votes 

on reproductive rights, he cast 26 anti-choice -- including a vote against 

abortion even in cases of rape, incest, or life endangerment.

</P>

<P>  Those who believe that women should control their own reproductive lives 

must remind Bush that he has no mandate to turn back the clock.
