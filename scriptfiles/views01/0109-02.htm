TO BORK OR not to Bork? That is the question.  President-elect George W. Bush is offering up a Cabinet that is reasonably diverse in gender and race, but not at all diverse in thinking. The collective brain waves of the proposed Bush team definitely surge to the right.

<P>

<P>Now, Democrats in a Senate split down the middle must decide how far they will go to challenge the nominees. The three who merit the toughest scrutiny are John Ashcroft for attorney general, Linda Chavez for labor secretary, and Gale Norton as secretary of the interior.

<P>

<P>Conservatives are working hard to put the Democrats on the defensive. Last week, The Wall Street Journal's dour editorial writers opened up with a predictably grim offensive against ''the crew that made Bork a verb.''   This was a reference to the liberals' successful fight to stop Judge Robert H. Bork's nomination to the Supreme Court toward the end of Ronald Reagan's second term. Opponents, led by Massachusetts Senator Edward M. Kennedy, put together a rejuvenated Democratic coalition. Labor unions, civil rights and civil liberties organizations, feminist and environmental groups mounted a sophisticated media blitz against Bork. They used his words and writings to demonstrate a right-wing social agenda that the Democratic-controlled Senate was ''brave'' enough to reject in 1987.

<P>

<P>Such bravery will be harder to come by in 2001. The current Senate makeup is likely to yield more cowards in search of crumbs from the Bush White House than heroes ready to fight for principles. That was evident last week when the black political caucus could not find a single US senator to join in seeking a formal objection to the counting of Florida's 25 electoral votes, on the grounds that black voters had been disenfranchised.

<P>

<P>Consider, too, last Saturday's article in The New York Times about ''the tempering'' of once staunch liberal New Jersey Senator Robert G. Torricelli. According to the Times, Torricelli is either trying to position himself as a Democratic liaison to the Bush administration or trying to get the new administration to back away from a Justice Department investigation into the financing of his 1996 Senate campaign. 

<P>

<P>Democrats have been running away from the L-word for the past 12 years. They were scared off, first, by the ridiculously rosy-colored prism through which the Reagan years continue to be viewed and then by George Bush's ''Borking'' of Michael S. Dukakis for the extreme sin of being a Massachusetts liberal. House and Senate Republicans in the House and Senate continue to demonize or ''Bork,'' if you will, everything liberal.

<P>

<P>With another Bush moving into the White House,  another Massachusetts senator is threatening to lead opposition to Ashcroft's confirmation as attorney general. John F. Kerry says he is inclined not to support Ashcroft, if he does not satisfy concerns that he is antiminority or too right-wing.   But Kerry won't use the L-word to frame the debate.

<P>

<P>''I don't know anything about the labels,'' he says. ''The question about the Ashcroft nomination is whether it represents mainstream America. I think there are serious questions ... I'm inclined not to support him, but I don't want us to go down the road of another Bork.''

<P>

<P>Kerry says that in the case of Bork, ''a number of senators took a position against him before the hearings. They amassed adamant opposition ahead of time. That's not taking place here. We are amassing a pronounced skepticism. We are expressing reservations, based on the record.''

<P>

<P>As Kerry must know, those are fine distinctions that will be lost in any real political battle. He and others should weigh their fear of being cast as liberals against the benefits.

<P>

<P>For one thing, the Bush victory fired up the Democrats' liberal base and not just in Massachusetts. Voters, especially in minority communities, are angry over the process and the outcome. Next time, they will be primed and ready to vote for those who stand up for them.  For another thing, Al Gore won the popular vote on the basis of a campaign that ran true to liberal causes. He got as many votes as he did because traditional liberal constituencies - labor, minorities, and women - supported him. Who wouldn't want their support in the future?  Maybe Democrats can't defeat these Cabinet nominees. But a spirited opposition, rooted in liberal principles, can lay the groundwork for the next critical battlegrounds, including the US Supreme Court.

<P>

<P>Besides, conservatives are not afraid to Bork the opposition, so, why should liberals shy away? Standing against something or someone for the right reasons is better than standing for nothing for the wrong ones.
