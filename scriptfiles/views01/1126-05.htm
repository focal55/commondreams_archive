Members of Congress are continuing to play hide-and-seek with their legislative 

records. Only two congressmen - Republican Reps. Christopher Shays of Connecticut 

and Frank Wolf of Virginia - have placed their voting records on the Internet 

in a searchable format easily accessible to citizens. Not a single U.S. senator 

has been willing to use the Internet in a manner that would give voters an open, 

accurate and quick way to track their votes.

<p> Thanks to taxpayers, computers equipped with Internet access are available 

in the offices of every one of the 535 members of the U.S. Senate and the House 

of Representatives. Posting voting records on their websites in a searchable citizen-friendly 

format would be a simple task.

<p> So, why the reluctance to implement something that would make it easy for 

voters to understand how their elected representatives were performing their official 

duties? 

<p> Flowery speeches about the public's right to know notwithstanding, most members 

of Congress are guided by the age-old political rule: "What the voters don't know 

can't hurt you on Election Day." If voters could pull up easy-to-read details 

on their computer screens about every vote a senator or a representative makes 

during a term, there might be some surprised voters and a lot of red-faced members 

of Congress in need of quick explanations.

<p> This past summer, two members of my staff - Noel Dingboom and Mark Wittink 

- worked with congressional interns in a survey of Senate and House offices to 

determine attitudes about the posting of voting records in a searchable format 

on the Internet. The answers were disappointing, with most members falling back 

on claims that votes were available on other Internet sites including those managed 

by various private organizations.

<p> Some of the explanations for the failure of members to post their own records 

seemed to translate into something akin to "the constituents are too dumb to understand" 

an unvarnished straightforward rendition of a congressional voting record.

<p> Reliance on private groups is tricky, at best. Most compile voting records 

in a manner to support their own policy positions. Others are selective about 

the issues and votes they list. And members of Congress have a long history of 

attempting to discredit as biased any group that publishes a voting record that 

makes their record look bad.

<p> It is true, as many offices cited, that the Library of Congress, through a 

service dubbed "Thomas," carries votes in conjunction with its Internet tracking 

of activity on the floor of the House and Senate. The process of extracting votes 

of individual members from "Thomas" is too cumbersome and time-consuming to be 

practical for most citizens. The same is true for the Congressional Record printed 

by the Government Printing Office.

<p> Unfortunately, sometimes Congress is able to rig the parliamentary procedures 

so that some items can slip through without a vote. One of these was a $4,900 

raise for all members that was allowed to go into effect earlier this month without 

a vote.

<p> It is little wonder that frequently fewer than 40 percent of the eligible 

voters turn out in biennial elections to select their senators and representatives. 

And millions of those who do arrive at the polls have only the most surface information 

about what their sitting senator or representative has been doing in Washington. 

Incumbents like to keep it that way.

<p> Information is the oxygen of democracy. It is also the basic ingredient that 

builds and maintains confidence and accountability in government. At a minimum, 

citizens have a right to know in detail the positions their representatives take 

on legislation. Congress should adopt a rule that would require that all members 

list their voting records on the Internet in an easily accessed, searchable format 

by member name, bill subject and title.

<p> This would be a giant step forward in efforts to ensure an informed electorate 

- and a more accountable Congress. Citizens should contact their senators and 

representatives and ask why this isn't being done. They can be reached through 

the Capitol switchboard - 202-224-3121 for senators; 202-225-3121 for representatives.
