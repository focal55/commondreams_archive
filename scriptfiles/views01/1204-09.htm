Most citizens capitulated to the dubious outcome of a disputed election

because there was little else one could do and - for the sake of the

country - we were told to ask questions later. There was however an

interesting reintroduction to a deeper patriotism. We asked questions

about the roots of our country and we contrasted our answers to the

rhetoric and policies from Bush and comapany. Something wasn’t lining up

and what the rest of the world was seeing many Americans also began to

see. Only fear and terror could put aside those questions and put the

will of the people behind the besieged administration . Fear and terror

arrived.  All questioning ceases; George is  given dictatorial powers

and Americans are being tube fed a manic and pumped up sense of

confidence. We’re going to be fine – we’re going to be fine – we’re

going to be just fine. No question.



<p>The war on terrorism offers an absolute evil for the population to rally

against. It’s simple and unambiguous. Ambiguity is not something George

has the patience, historical perspective or attention span for and he

represents and promotes this feature in the American sensibility. He

says it’s a new kind of war against evil. But it appears to be the same

kind of war we've seen before against something much more complex. What

we're watching we have watched before. A powerful military bombs a

country that only has guerilla capabilities or an inferior militia. Many

civilians are killed; rage grows; terrorism becomes the only weapon of

reprisal. People will always organize to create chaos until there is no

reason to organize and until chaos is no longer useful or necessary. The

comparison has been made between the war on terrorism and the war on

poverty, the war on drugs and the war on cancer. It sounds macho and

forthright but these “wars” are fictions that by the heat of their own

declaration must ignore root causes and questions. The war on terrorism

has a particular reason for ignoring root causes since whatever

grievance a terrorist attack may be addressing instantly becomes off

limits since addressing the grievance will be perceived as submission

and  reward. Asking why a terrorist attack happens almost implicates the

person asking as an accomplice. Instead of being a dispassionate inquiry

in search of a solution, asking why becomes tantamount to harboring a

terrorist.



<p>Bush and Sharon believe violence is necessary  – they believe in an eye

for an eye. They believe military action will bring peace. It has been

said that if violence could bring peace, Israel should be the safest

place in the world. We are told that terrorists are being killed in

Afghanistan. There’s no way to know how true that is but it is safe to

assume that out of this “new kind of war” terrorists are being born. The

terrorists America needs to be concerned about may not be in Afghanistan

at all. The cunning and committed terrorist is the one we need to be

searching for. A fighter in Afghanistan is surely committed but he is

most likely not a terrorist and he is certainly not cunning. By

definition a terrorist uses surprise and secrecy. The

soldiers/operatives being killed in Afghanistan are openly fighting a

military. That is not the action of a terrorist whose most important

weapon is secrecy.



<p>Bush, although not a fan of terrorists, is a big fan of secrecy. If one

were suspicious, the accidental bombing of Al-jazeera in Kabul could be

interpreted as a measure by which secrecy was secured. More blatantly,

if secrecy can be blatant, the suppression of the Reagan papers, the

need for military tribunals, his drunk driving record, the sources for

his energy policies, the Bush bin-Laden connection, the Carlyle group

and now possibly American casualties, are all covered with a veil.

Several Pakistani papers are reporting sixty-five Marine deaths in

Afghanistan. The official word from the Pentagon is there has been only

one casualty. No word that will encourage the opposition or discourage

the “shoulder to shoulder” pro war sentiment will be uttered from the

Pentagon. Keeping the price of a military solution secret must be

considered necessary for success. No one should ask how many soldiers

have been killed. We are told they most likely will be killed – but ask

questions about that later.



<p>As veils are lifted in Afghanistan the veil in America gets tighter.

Even America's second lady, Lynne Cheney, is making the rounds

encouraging college “elitists” to cool the critical rhetoric and

acknowledge and declare that they are outside the mainstream; ie admit

your opinion doesn't matter - really. Prime Minister Sharon announced to

the Israeli media that he was impressed at how well behaved and noble

the Americans were in their capitulation to the war.  He offered this as

a great model for his people. According to Sharon, Americans are the

shining example of how to cooperate with a war and how not to be

critical. Everyone be quiet and let the Bush/Sharon principle of bombing

our way to peace have time to work. In a unified voice Bush/Sharon will

say, “There will be plenty of time to discuss all this when we have

peace. But until then, no questions please. Shoulder to shoulder please.

Once we do the thing that you’re trying to be critical of then we can

listen to your criticisms. But please – we know what we’re doing. We

know how to make peace. We’ve been at it for years and years and years –

and it will happen –  make no mistake – there will be peace - we’re all

dying for peace. No question about it - please.”
