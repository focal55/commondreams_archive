This week, leaders of 34 nations will gather in Quebec City for the third Summit of the Americas. On behalf of a powerful and growing movement in Latin America, I'm coming to Canada to deliver a message: &#34;Plan Colombia,&#34; the U.S.-backed anti-drug aid package, must be stopped -- for the good of Colombia and the hemisphere.

<P>Last year, the U.S. Congress approved a $1.3-billion contribution toward Plan Colombia to combat the supply of drugs at their source. The Bush administration recently asked Congress to approve an additional $700-million to expand counter-narcotics assistance for Colombia and neighbouring Andean countries. The efforts aim to eradicate coca, the raw material used to produce cocaine, by destroying crops and bolstering the army's effort to retake areas now controlled by leftist guerillas.</P>

<P>As a Bolivian, I can offer a perspective about the impact of the United States' flawed supply-side drug-control programs. In my country, U.S.-sponsored militarized eradication campaigns have succeeded in drastically reducing coca cultivation in recent years. But the failure of such programs to address the poverty and inequality at the root of drug production has exacerbated Bolivia's economic crisis, and sparked massive social unrest. In the end, the Bolivian eradication campaign has simply produced a corresponding increase in coca production in Colombia, with violent consequences.</P>

<P>Bolivians, as well as our neighbours in Venezuela, Peru, Ecuador and Brazil, are understandably concerned about the spillover of refugees, illicit drug cultivation and drug traffickers that a &#34;successful&#34; Plan Colombia will generate. A growing movement of leaders throughout Europe and Latin America are voicing concern about the long-term consequences for Colombia and the region and are calling for an alternative approach.</P>

<P>This week, 100 Latin American civic and political leaders, including Nobel laureates Rigoberta Mench Tum and Adolfo Perez Esquivel, former Bolivian president Lydia Gueiler Tejada and former Colombian foreign minister Rodrigo Pardo, joined me in sending a letter to George W. Bush urging him to use the Quebec City summit as an opportunity to take Plan Colombia back to the drawing board.</P>

<P>We wrote: &#34;We . . . know there are no easy answers or quick fixes to Colombia's tragic dilemma of warfare and drug-related violence.</P>

<P>And we believe the United States has a legitimate interest in reducing the damage done by illegal drug use. But we are gravely concerned that current policy will cause more harm than good in Colombia and in the region at large -- while having little or no effect on the drug problems of the consumer countries.&#34;</P>

<P>Latin American nations share a desire to curb the violence and corruption caused by the illicit drug trade. But history shows that forced crop-eradication campaigns in Latin America have consistently failed to stop the flow of drugs north; more than a decade of such efforts has resulted in <I>no significant decrease </I>in total drug production and trafficking. New sources of supply inevitably arise to satisfy demand. In the United States, drugs are as readily available as ever.</P>

<P>U.S. support for Plan Colombia's military strategy was conceived without consulting state governments in southern Colombia or with civil society leaders in neighbouring countries. It wasn't approved by the Colombian congress. In fact, after the European Union's rejection of Plan Colombia in its current form, the United States is the only nation willing to finance the Colombian military. Most of the world recognizes that the plan's military emphasis will intensify the internal conflict, undermine the ongoing peace process, and drive many more poor farmers off of their land.</P>

<P>It's time to forge a new path; effective and humane, it must promote democracy, human rights and economic development. Instead of expanding misguided, harmful policies, the United States, along with the international community, should offer resources to address the root social causes of Colombia's drug problems, and help to negotiate a peaceful settlement of the hemisphere's longest-running conflict. 

<p><I>Antonio Aranibar Quiroga was foreign minister of Bolivia from 1993 to 1997.</I></P>
