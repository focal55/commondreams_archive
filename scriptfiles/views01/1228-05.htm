Swimmers know.  In the water at the beach, an undertow can drag them down.  

In business, a lack of buying power can drag sales down.  Then workers lose 

jobs.  Congressional Democrats and Republicans appear not to understand 

these economic connections.



<p>The economic stimulus plan that just bit the dust in Congress is a case in 

point.  It really fell flat for Americans having a hard time making ends 

meet during a recession that officially began last March.  Congress claims 

to represent the American public, which experienced a November unemployment 

rate of 5.7 percent, the highest level in more than six years.



<p>“Even more important than the rate of unemployment is how quickly it

rose,” said <a href="http://bellarmine.lmu.edu/%7EJDevine/" target="_new">James Devine</a>, a political economist at Loyola Marymount 

University.  On a related note, consumer spending dipped 0.7 percent in 

November.  "The fall  in consumer spending is part of what I call an 

underconsumption undertow," he said.



<p>In America and around the world, workers are struggling to buy what they 

have made for sale on the market.  In a sense, the market system has worked 

too well.  The share of income going to profits has increasingly flowed 

upward, away from the laboring majority.  Inequality of income distribution 

is a recurring feature of the system, engulfing foreign nations in the past 

decade and the world before the Great Depression, Professor Devine noted.



<p>How has the U.S. economy grown in spite of the 1990s version of the 

underconsumption undertow?  According to Professor Devine, the growth was 

due mostly to borrowed money.  That helped America avoid the undertow 

affecting other national economies—temporarily.  "Over-borrowing eventually 

helps to drag the economy down," he said.



<p>To be sure, there are limits to credit-driven consumption.  Unemployment is 

one way to put the brakes on borrowing.  Yet the slowdown doesn’t happen 

overnight.  U.S. consumers increased their debt by about $250 billion over 

the last year, according to the Dec. 22 New York Times.



<p>Some of that consumer debt overhang is from luxury spending.  This is the 

socio-economic class that has lived well, thanks partly to the overvalued 

stock market.  A successful few parlayed their good fortune in financial 

speculation to buy more high-priced cars, jewelry and houses.  More 

recently, however, the bloom has left this stock market rose.  Share prices 

have fallen, yet the debts from the lavish spending sprees remain.



<p>At the same time, less-fortunate Americans have used credit differently.  

They have gone into debt for necessary items such as clothes, food and 

health care.  They are the group of people with no investment income, a 

paycheck away from material hardship.  Many are the so-called working poor 

whose low wages can drive them to food banks.  The U.S. Conference of Mayors 

recently found that 25 of 27 cities surveyed had an average 23 percent rise 

in requests for emergency food assistance during the past year.



<p>Currently, the American economy is shifting to slow/no growth.  It shrank 

1.3 percent in third-quarter 2001.  The American economy, roughly two-thirds 

of which is consumer spending, is situated at the center of the world 

system.  The International Monetary Fund recently said that prospects for 

global growth in 2002 are dismal.  The point?



<p>The recession’s effects are national and global.  Consider one example 

involving the American worker/consumer.  When s/he is under- or unemployed, 

consumer spending on imports to the U.S. is depressed.  This, in turn, hurts 

foreign workers whose jobs depend on Americans’ consumer spending.



<p>Well, Congress returns to work next month.  Will it sing a tune of fiscal 

bipartisanship for Americans who need the federal government to help keep 

them economically afloat?  Or will the Democrats and Republicans on Capitol 

Hill still ignore this part of the undertow of underconsumption?
