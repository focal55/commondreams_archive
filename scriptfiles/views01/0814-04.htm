            <p> "What we feared has come true," Israeli sociologist Baruch Kimmerling 

              writes in Israel's leading newspaper. Jews and Palestinians are 

              "regressing to superstitious tribalism.... War appears an unavoidable 

              fate," an "evil colonial" war. This prospect is likely if the U.S. 

              grants tacit authorization, with grim consequences that may reverberate 

              far beyond.<BR>

              <BR>

              There is, of course, no symmetry between the "ethno-national groups" 

              regressing to tribalism. The conflict is centered in territories 

              that have been under harsh military occupation since 1967. The conqueror 

              is a major armed power, acting with massive military, economic and 

              diplomatic support from the global superpower. Its subjects are 

              alone and defenseless, many barely surviving in miserable camps.<BR>

              <BR>

              The cruelty of the occupation has been sharply condemned by international 

              and Israeli human rights groups for many years. The purpose of the 

              terror, economic strangulation and daily humiliation is not obscure. 

              It was articulated in the early years of the occupation by Moshe 

              Dayan, one of the Israeli leaders most sympathetic to the Palestinian 

              plight, who advised his Labor Party associates to tell the Palestinians 

              that "you shall continue to live like dogs, and whoever wishes may 

              leave." The Oslo "peace process" changed the modalities, but not 

              the basic concept. Shortly before joining the Ehud Barak government, 

              historian Shlomo Ben-Ami, a dove in the U.S.-Israeli spectrum, wrote 

              that "the Oslo agreements were founded on a neocolonialist basis." 

              The intent was to impose on the Palestinians "almost total dependence 

              on Israel" in a "colonial situation" that was to be "permanent." 

              He soon became the architect of the latest Barak government proposals, 

              virtually identical to Bill Clinton's final plan.<BR>

              <BR>

              These proposals were highly praised in U.S. commentary; the Palestinians 

              and Yasser Arafat were blamed for their failure and the subsequent 

              violence.<BR>

              <BR>

              That presentation "was a fraud perpetrated on Israeli ... and international 

              ... public opinion," Kimmerling writes accurately. He continues 

              that, a look at a map suffices to show that the Clinton-Barak plans 

              "presented to the Palestinians impossible terms." Crucially, Israel 

              retained "two settlement blocs that in effect cut the West Bank 

              into pieces." The Palestinian enclaves also are effectively separated 

              from the center of Palestinian life in Jerusalem; the Gaza Strip 

              remains isolated, its population virtually imprisoned.<BR>

              <BR>

              Israeli settlement in the territories doubled during the years of 

              the "peace process," increasing under Barak, who bequeathed the 

              new government of Ariel Sharon "a surprising legacy," the Israeli 

              press reported as the transition took place early this year: "The 

              highest number of housing starts in the territories" since the time 

              when Sharon supervised settlements in 1992, before Oslo. The facts 

              on the ground are the living reality for the desperate population.<BR>

              <BR>

              The nature of permanent neo-colonial dependency was underscored 

              by Israel's High Court of Justice in November 1999 when it rejected 

              yet another Palestinian petition opposing further expansion of the 

              &#91;Jewish&#93; city of Maale Adumim established to the east of 

              Jerusalem, virtually partitioning the West Bank.<BR>

              <BR>

              The court suggested that "some good for the residents of neighboring 

              &#91;Palestinian villages&#93; might spring from the economic and 

              cultural development" of the all-Jewish city. While they try to 

              survive without water to drink or fields to cultivate, the people 

              whose lands have been taken can enjoy the sight of the ample housing, 

              green lawns, swimming pools and other amenities of the heavily subsidized 

              Israeli settlements.<BR>

              <BR>

              Immediately after World War II, the Geneva Conventions were adopted 

              to bar repetition of Nazi crimes, including transfer of population 

              to occupied territories or actions that harm civilians. As a so-called 

              high contracting party, the U.S. is obligated "to ensure respect" 

              for the conventions.<BR>

              <BR>

              With Israel alone opposed, the United Nations has repeatedly declared 

              the conventions applicable to the occupied territories; the U.S. 

              abstains from these votes, unwilling to take a public stand in violation 

              of fundamental principles of international law, which require it 

              to act to prevent settlement and expropriation, attacks on civilians 

              with U.S.-supplied helicopters, collective punishment and all other 

              repressive measures used by the occupying forces. Washington has 

              continued to provide the means to implement these practices, refusing 

              even to allow observers who might reduce violence and protect the 

              victims.<BR>

              <BR>

              For 25 years, there has been a near-unanimous international consensus 

              on the terms of political settlement: a full peace treaty with establishment 

              of a Palestinian state after Israeli withdrawal, an outcome that 

              enjoys wide support even within Israel. It has been blocked by Washington 

              ever since its veto of a Security Council resolution to that effect 

              in 1976.<BR>

              <BR>

              It is far from an ideal solution. But the likely current alternatives 

              are far more ugly.
