THE LAND of bulging surpluses, why is it that Congress has put the nation&#39;s passenger rail line on a starvation budget? 

<P> And why is it that Congress continues to believe its own fiction that Amtrak will turn a profit by December 2002? 

<P> It&#39;s time for Congress, and the Bush administration, to confront reality. 

<P> Here are some facts worth remembering. 

<P> 

<li> No national passenger rail service anywhere in the world is profitable. In fact, Britain&#39;s privatization of its superb passenger rail network has been an unmitigated disaster. 

<P> 

<li> Amtrak has been starved for funds by Washington throughout its 30-year history. Is anyone surprised Amtrak still needs vast improvements to its tracks and trains? 

<P> 

<li> With increased highway gridlock and airport congestion, inter-city rail travel offers an appealing option, if funded properly. 

<P> But the United States ranks somewhere between Estonia and Tunisia in its level of support for national rail service. 

<P> At the moment, Congress is trying to have it both ways. It insists on maintaining a nationwide passenger-rail operation but doesn&#39;t want to pay for it. 

<P> Washington has a bad case of &quot;mission conflict,&quot; as Amtrak president George Warrington put it last month. Running a nationwide, inter-city passenger rail service is &quot;not compatible&quot; with running a profit, he said. 

<P> &quot;If you&#39;re a public service provider, you go where the community need is, &quot; Mr. Warrington explained. &quot;If you&#39;re a business, you go where the money is. But if you&#39;re Amtrak, considering that conflicting mission, which way do you go?&quot; 

<P> At the moment, conservative Republicans insist on achieving that profit objective. But those same lawmakers refuse to let Amtrak relinquish routes that serve their states. 

<P> Norman Y. Mineta, President Bush&#39;s transportation secretary, wants Amtrak to downsize its 22,000-mile route system as a way to turn a profit. That might reduce Amtrak&#39;s operating losses, but it won&#39;t create a moneymaker. 

<P> Only one of the 40-plus Amtrak routes is profitable - the busy Washington-to-New York line that runs through Baltimore. Some critics have suggested Amtrak eliminate nearly all service except its successful routes along the East Coast and West Coast. 

<P> That might make a fine private-business plan, but what would Congress and the president offer citizens in the rest of the country? 

<P> Amtrak officials have sought to run their trains more like a private company in recent years. Republicans in Congress forced that decision when they mandated in 1997 that Amtrak&#39;s self-sufficiency by December 2002. 

<P> Cost savings have been set at $1 billion over four years. Amtrak is contracting with private companies to carry more commercial shipments. And Congress&#39; operating subsidy has dropped from $318 million in 1999 to $59 million this year and a requested $40 million for next year. 

<P> Both ridership and revenue have risen over the past four years. But so have expenses. 

<P> The rail operation remains far from break-even. Federal investigators say Amtrak doesn&#39;t even have enough money to make the bare minimum of needed capital improvements. 

<P> Last week, Mr. Mineta gave Amtrak permission to borrow $300 million - using part of New York&#39;s Pennsylvania Station as collateral - to keep it operating till the fiscal year ends Sept. 30. 

<P> Not only is that move - borrowing to pay for ongoing expenses - unwise, it also underlines the severity of Amtrak&#39;s situation. 

<P> Meanwhile, unmet capital needs are staggering. Just improving New York&#39;s web of tunnels could cost $900 million. Mr. Warrington has proposed a 20-year, $30 billion infrastructure project, but that&#39;s a low-ball figure. 

<P> Amtrak pins its hope on bringing business-class, high-speed trains to the United States. Yet delays in putting the Washington-to-Boston Acela Express into service this spring contributed mightily to Amtrak&#39;s cash crisis. 

<P> It&#39;s also debatable if Acela Express is the answer. 

<P> Yes, Amtrak is buying trains that can hit 150 miles per hour, but antiquated tracks and 150-year-old rights of way make extended high-speed service impossible. 

<P> Take, for instance, Baltimore&#39;s Civil War-era tunnels. Forget 150 mph: the speed limit is 25 mph. It will take hundreds of millions of dollars to reconstruct those tunnels to accommodate both high-speed passenger trains and double-stack freight trains. 

<P> There&#39;s another problem - delays. They&#39;re common as passenger service takes a back seat to freight trains, whose companies own the tracks. 

<P> Still, a network of high-speed passenger rail routes could serve an important national purpose in an era of energy shortages and clogged airports and highways. Fifty-two senators are sponsoring a bill that would let Amtrak float $12 billion in bonds over 10 years to start building such a system. 

<P> That could eventually mean a two-hour commute between Washington and New York, which would make taking the train a far more competitive option. 

<P> Congress has got to alter its attitude toward Amtrak. It deserves far more federal support. Since Amtrak&#39;s creation in 1971, it has received $11 billion in federal support, versus $750 billion in federal support for highways and aviation. 

<P> What would train service be like today if Amtrak had gotten even a fraction of that backing? Take a look at the high-speed service from Portland, Ore. to Seattle. The Cascades line - as it is known - has grown 400 percent, to 500,000 yearly customers in seven years. 

<P> High-speed routes compare favorably to new highway construction. Adding high-speed tracks in Connecticut, for instance, costs $8 million per mile versus $50 million per lane mile of new interstate road construction. Trains can accommodate far more passengers, too. 

<P> Twenty-two million people used Amtrak last year in 45 states. (Baltimore&#39;s Penn Station was the eighth busiest with 916,840 boardings.) Just on its Washington-to-New York route, Amtrak carried enough passengers to fill 121 airline flights a day. 

<P> Ridership rose 5 percent in the first three months of this year, and ticket revenue jumped 10 percent. The biggest gains were in the west. Given California&#39;s energy crisis, there&#39;s no telling how many people there would consider using Amtrak for some of their travel if the ride were fast and affordable. 

<P> What&#39;s lacking is a strong commitment by Congress and the president to national train service. That would require rewriting the 1997 law that cuts off funds to Amtrak a year from December. 

<P> Growing ridership is the key, not profitability. Congress must put up enough money to make high-speed connections a reality on Amtrak&#39;s major routes. 

<P> Americans deserve reliable, modern and efficient passenger rail service, even if it means on-going assistance from Washington.
