Reports about the Summit of the Americas, to take place in Quebec City on April 21-22, usually give simplistic statements as to why many people are traveling there to protest against the Free Trade Agreement of the Americas.

<p>I am joining many others who, like me, reject the term anti-globalization, which is used negatively to portray who we the protesters are and why we will gather outside the chain-linked fences, in front of heavily armed forces.

<P>Globalization is not new. The roots of today's global political, economic military and cultural integration go back over 500 years. We are against a political and economic model that exploits people; violates their economic, political, social, civil and cultural rights; and abuses the planet's resources and environment.

<P>Refering to the 34 ``elected'' leaders invited to Quebec is insulting to millions of people in the Americas whose lives are marked by poverty and repression, imposed by pseudo-democratic regimes. Misleading references to ``elected'' leaders ignore that these governments (ranging from formally democratic to the openly repressive and corrupt) are kept in place in part due to: economic and military ties with the dominant nations from the north, certain corporations and banks, and inter-governmental institutions such as the World Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank, the International Monetary Fund and others.

<P>Some would dismiss this as an anti-globalization rant. Instead they should question: Why aren't repression and poverty front-page news? Why don't officials decry those social ills in parliamentary and congressional sessions? Why don't our leaders question the policies and programs of inter-governmental institutions that deepen poverty -- even as more wealth is accumulated by a small group of countries, individuals, corporations and banks?

<P>Foreign affairs used to be the exclusive domain of political, economic and media elites. This is no longer the case.

<P>Increasing numbers of citizens of the north travel to or live in the ``developing'' countries or in the impoverished slums and native reserves of the ``developed'' north. Also, many education institutions are teaching an unvarnished version of history and global affairs, looking closely at the causes of the poverty, environmental destruction and repression that are common fare for millions of our global co-citizens.

<P>Thousands of us are traveling to Quebec City to protest the lack of sincerity and political will of our ``leaders'' and dominant economic sectors, and to advocate for serious political and economic change. We do so through a sense of solidarity with people across the Americas, a sense of responsibility that the north is contributing to repression and impoverishment in the south, and a sense of urgency that transforming the dominant political-economic model, eradicating poverty and ending repression cannot wait.
