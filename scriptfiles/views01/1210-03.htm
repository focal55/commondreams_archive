<b>“There Is No Alternative”?</b><br>

These days Margaret Thatcher’s infamous acronym, “TINA” seems to be

on all official lips and to be heard echoing down all the mainstream public

airways with hypnotic repetitiveness.&nbsp;&nbsp; TINA. TINA.&nbsp; TINA.&nbsp;

We are being told “There Is No Alternative.”&nbsp; Resistance is futile.&nbsp;

No alternative to globalization. No alternative to the WTO, IMF &amp; World

Bank, to trade and profit trumping environmental protection and human rights,

to the petroleum-plutonium economy.

<p>No alternative to corporate rule, to merged media monopolies, to bought

and rigged elections, to landmines and clusterbombs, to a terroristic war

on terrorism, to an imperial presidency, to suspension of civil liberties,

to racial profiling. No alternative to a zombie patriotism that precludes

all dissent, to violent police attacks on non-violent demonstrators, to

the criminalization of public assembly &amp; protest.

<p>No alternative to wiretapping &amp; e-mail surveillance, to warrentless

search and arrest without probable cause, to secret courts with no due

process, to legalizing the torture of suspects, to authorizing political

assassinations, to giving “no quarter” to surrendering combatants, to causing

millions of refugees to starve.&nbsp; No alternative to “sanctioning” the

deaths of 5000 Iraqi children per month, to violation of international

law, to opposing a World Court while seeking to establish a worldwide police

state.&nbsp; No alternative to the militarization and nuclearization of

space.&nbsp; No alternative to a planetwide Pax Americana.

<p>Without all these things, goes the TINA mantra, the world will descend

even deeper into chaos, poverty, violence and ecological collapse.&nbsp;

No alternative but that America must assume the imperial mantle thrust

upon it by history (or more accurately, by the crimes against humanity

of the likes of Zbigniew Brzezinski and Henry Kissinger) and ruthlessly

exercise its power as the first -&nbsp; and very likely the last&nbsp;

- global empire.

<p><b>The Evolutionary Imperative</b>

<br>

In fact all signs point, like a forest in the wind, to the likelihood

that the very opposite is the case; that it is these very measures and

policies and actions and institutions and ideological conceits that are

relentlessly destroying humanity’s options for a peaceful, secure, sustainable

future on a healthy planet.

<p>“Without vision,” goes the Biblical maxim, “the people perish.”&nbsp;

Chronic adrenaline rushes are conducive to neither imaginative vision nor

rational thought.&nbsp; In a climate of constant fear - induced, let us

acknowledge, not only by actual terrorist acts, but also and most persistently

by repeated government warnings of impending, but unspecified threats -

in such a climate both vision and&nbsp; people perish.&nbsp; Its very difficult

to think straight.&nbsp; Difficult to think outside the box provided by

the daily media barrage of what is openly admitted to be propaganda - all

for the sake of “security.”

<p><b>Homeplanet Security</b>

<br>

But this is all Orwellian to the max.&nbsp; Because real&nbsp; security,

common&nbsp; security, or what might be called “homeplanet “ security&nbsp;

- as contrasted with “homeland “ security - most certainly consists in

the reliable absence of fear and violence and in the dependable presence

of uncontaminated food, water and air,&nbsp; of health care, human and

labor rights,&nbsp; gender equality, housing, education, cultural and racial

tolerance and diversity, just laws and informed democratic choice.

<p>That’s why it‘s now more important than ever for those of us who know

better to stand up and say so. Vital for we who hold and nourish the knowledge

and certainty - along with Eduardo Galeano and the organizers of the upcoming

2nd annual <a href="http://www.forumsocialmundial.org.br/eng/index.asp" target="_new">World Social Forum</a> in Porto Alegre, Brazil, where over 2000

organizations from 85 countries will meet next February - that “another

world is possible.”&nbsp; Urgent to point to the alternative, humanely

and ecologically sustainable systems, processes and institutions that are

already up and working at every level around the world.&nbsp; And essential

to foster and insist upon their growth in our own households, communities

and in all our spheres of action and influence. Current events must convince

us that another world is not only possible, it’s necessary.

<p>It’s time to assert the freedoms we have left; to exercise our remaining

options.&nbsp; Its time to seize the present and take back the future.&nbsp;

That’s global citizenship.&nbsp; That’s planetary patriotism.&nbsp; That’s

our main avenue to sustainability and survival.&nbsp; Otherwise, where

the health of the planetary biosphere is concerned, it may be a case of

remission impossible.&nbsp; The evolutionary victories represented by the

abolution, suffragette, labor, civil rights, feminist, gay rights, landless

peasant and other grassroots movements around the world show that, as Ruckus

Society Director John Sellers puts it, “resistance is fertile.”&nbsp; If

we’re committed to the fulfillment of our highest evolutionary potential,

when you get right down to it,<b> there is no alternative.</b>
