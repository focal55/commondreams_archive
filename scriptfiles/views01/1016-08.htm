Since the evil events of Sept. 11, the religious community has 

been clear and consistent in condemning the terrorists who brought 

violence to our shores. We have also said that a morally rooted 

response to this terror must focus on bringing the perpetrators to 

justice, rather than military reprisals that do harm to more 

innocents. A broad spectrum of religious leaders has expressed a 

strong determination to protect both the innocent lives threatened 

by further terrorist attacks and the innocent civilians jeopardized 

by military retaliation. 



<p>We believe there was wisdom in the restraint shown for almost a 

month by the U.S. government, in the building of an international 

coalition against terrorism, and in the fact that the developing 

strategy to root out terrorism included not just military but many 

other fronts. Now that the air strikes have begun, that 

multifaceted approach must not be lost in a widening war. We cannot 

simply wish away the questions to be answered and problems to be 

solved -- we must punish those responsible for the mass murders and 

prevent further terrorist violence. But we are now at a critical 

moral turning point between pursuing justice or waging a wider war. 



<p>The central importance of the defense of innocent lives must be 

made clear and compelling in the midst of the air strikes now 

underway. Already, we've seen tragic unintended results of U.S. 

bombing in the deaths of Afghan civilians. Despite clear efforts 

to avoid civilian casualties and apologies from the Pentagon for 

bombs that have missed their targets, experience shows us that 

bombing always results in the suffering of the innocent -- both 

through "collateral damage" and through civilian dislocation. The 

human crisis in Afghanistan of enormous refugee dislocation has 

been made worse by the bombings, and relief agencies are warning of 

a massive humanitarian disaster in the making unless ground 

shipments of aid are restored. 



<p>Now that the Taliban's "command and communication" centers and 

its military capabilities have been greatly diminished by the air 

strikes, it is time to shift strategies. The most effective and 

morally defensible strategy would be one focused clearly on 

bringing the terrorists to justice, fully utilizing the rule of law 

and international forces, and employing multiple tactics. We should 

undertake a police operation with special forces from many 

countries to vanquish the terrorist networks, instead of the 

widening war that continued bombing will bring. The U.S. should 

also urge the U.N. Security Council to establish a special 

international tribunal to try those responsible. 



<p>Such a focused and international campaign would not only be 

morally superior to an escalating U.S.-led war against the states 

that sponsor terrorism (with a heavy cost to their people), it 

would also be far less dangerous, and ultimately more effective in 

actually defeating the terrorist threat. It is imperative to 

prevent the scenario of an expanding American war in the Arab 

world, increasing the danger of more terrorist attacks in America 

and Europe, prompting more escalation, and thereby risking a cycle 

of violence that becomes more and more difficult to stop. 



<p>This strategy may take more time. But applying discipline, 

patience, and perseverance to cripple the networks, assets, and 

capabilities of violent terrorists is more likely to produce 

lasting results than massive military actions whose targets and 

consequences are increasingly unclear. President Bush's best action 

now would be to follow his own words of "patient justice."
