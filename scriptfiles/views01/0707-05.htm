CHARLESTON, S.C. -- Take a short stroll circling the waterfront off Battery

Park, and it's hard to tell whether the Old South or a new, updated

version, is winning out in Charleston. In and around the park stand genteel

mansions, a slouching white gazebo, and the occasional hoop-skirted tour

guide, buttering up a gaggle of visitors in search of Old South charm. These

nostalgic flourishes reflect a deeper tone in the port city, run by a

good-ol'-boy network just the way one might expect in a state that keeps the

very senior senator Strom Thurmond propped in Congress, and whose fondness

for the old ways kept the Confederate battle flag flying over the state

capitol until last year.



<p>But Charleston is also the crown jewel of a state desperately wanting to be

seen as cosmopolitan and "world class." And if one refocuses the eyes

further down the coastline, faintly visible are the massive cranes, vessels

and kindred machinery that comprise South Carolina's portal to its global

future: the Charleston shipyards.



<p>The old ways are cute, but integration in the global economy pays the bills.

Harboring vessels from nine of the world's 10 biggest shipping

lines, Charleston is the fourth-busiest container port in the country. And

the port's role in making South Carolina a "global player" is only expected

to rise, as international auto companies like BMW funnel their wares through

Charleston to expand operations on the other side of the state.



<p>So for the state's leaders, stakes were high when, in January of 2000, 150

members of the International Longshoreman Association Local 1422, held a

militant picket to protest the use of non-union labor by a small, renegade

shipping line on the Charleston docks. The demonstration soon escalated into

a violent face-off between authorities and the workers, five of whom now

face trial for felony rioting charges in what has become one of the most

closely-watched Southern labor battles in over a decade, and which speaks

volumes about the economic and political struggles at the heart of the South

today.





<p>IN SOUTH CAROLINA, the Old South culture occasionally comes into conflict

with the excited Newer South visions of the boosters. There was the time in

the mid-1990s, for example, when one multinational company, courted by state

leaders to move to South Carolina, took note of the state's flag controversy

and ultimately shunned what it labeled "the cracker capitol of the world."



<p>But usually the minds of the Southern elite, both traditional and modern,

meld on a common program: pro-corporate economics, and racially coded

politics, the only question for debate being the appropriate proportions of

the two.



<p>This past June 9, some two hours inland from the coast, 5,000 spirited

demonstrators gathered on the state capitol in Columbia to protest what they

saw as the latest manifestation of this unholy alliance, the case of the

Charleston Five. For over 200 years, the Charleston docks have been worked

by generations of African-American labor -- and four of the five facing

charges are black -- making the crackdown on the ILA a flashpoint for labor

and freedom struggles.



<p>The June rally was originally called by the South Carolina Progressive

Network and local labor leaders, but soon attracted interest nation-wide.

Many agreed with Bill Fletcher, Jr. -- who has coordinated the national

AFL-CIO's support for the workers -- that "this is a very compelling case,

one that brings together all the issues, a voice at work and the right to

organize, issues of racial justice and issues of democracy."



<p>Tracing the same route through Columbia's depressed downtown that was used

by over 40,000 demonstrators against the Confederate flag last year, the

June

mobilization was impressive not only for its size -- as an older city native

commented, "this has got to be the biggest labor rally in Columbia since the

1930s" -- but also for the range of participants. Buses from North Carolina,

Georgia and even New York delivered dozens of union locals who militantly

declared their solidarity.



<p>The rally also attracted a sizable showing of Seattle-generation protesters

(sans handkerchiefs) and, to the astonishment of locals, swarms of left

grouplets who ringed the demonstration, newspapers held high. And in South

Carolina, where labor rights *are* civil rights, the program featured

leaders of the civil rights establishment, although these groups' numbers

were small in the crowd.



<p>The larger political and economic dimension was not lost on the marchers.

Numerous speakers noted that South Carolina's unionization rate -- at three

percent, the lowest in the country -- is no accident. Anti-union and

anti-worker zeal, begun in earnest during labor's textile campaigns of the

1930s and refined during the industrialization boom of the 1970s, has

reached a new level. One piece of legislation pending before the state

legislature would prohibit municipalities from setting a wage higher than

the federal minimum -- pre-emptively spiking local "living wage"

initiatives. Another bill preventing longshore workers from serving on

Charleston's Port Authority -- targeted at ILA Local 1422 President Kenny

Riley, who was unanimously asked to serve on the Authority in 1999 -- has

been revived from last year.



<p>As Brett Bursey of the Progressive Network remarks, "they'd bring back

slavery if they could."





<p>IT WAS IN 1821 that a recently freed slave in Charleston, Denmark Vesey,

having bought his way out of chains, began planning a slave revolt to free

the rest. Vesey had originally planned to spark rebellion throughout South

Carolina through agitation, which would hopefully spread to undermine the

South's entire plantation complex. But he grew impatient, and began

organizing his own uprising.



<p>It almost worked. By the next year, nearly all the slaves in plantations

surrounding Charleston were prepared to join the revolt. But a day before

the insurrection, one slave betrayed Vesey, who along with five associates

were quickly tried and hanged. Once Vesey's intricate plan became known, it

struck fear into the planter class; the public execution of Vesey and his

compatriots was seen as critical in convincing slaves across the South to

think twice before daring to act for their freedom.



<p>The port picket planned by ILA Local 1422 on January 20, 2000, was much less

ambitious, but one wouldn't know it from the response of the South Carolina

establishment. What exactly transpired on that chilly day is now a matter of

legal dispute, and the workers' legal team is staying silent as the

Charleston Five await trial, probably this fall.



<p>What is known is that the trouble began in October of 1999, when the

small-time Nordana shipping line notified Local 1422 that it was ending its

23-year relationship with the union and would be using non-union labor to

work its ships. A couple peaceful pickets followed, but eventually state

officials decided it was time to show which side they're on.



<p>On January 20 of the next year, as the Nordana ship Skodsborg rolled into

harbor with 20 non-union workers prepared to unload its cargo, 150 ILA

picketers greeted the ship to express their dissatisfaction. Also on hand,

to the surprise of the ILA workers, were massed 600 paramilitary-style

officers representing law enforcement agencies from local cops to highway

patrol.



<p>The show of force was dazzling: police helicopters hovered overhead; land

units road on horses and others in armored vehicles; canine units held

snarling dogs at bay; black-clothed police squads stood poised with beanbag

bullets; patrol boats cruised the waterside of the terminal, apparently

staving off a possible union invasion by sea. "You would think there was

going to be a terrorist attack on the State of South Carolina," Riley says.



<p>As the saying goes: when you prepare for war, that's what you get. Some say

a longshoreman made the first move, trampling a local cop's foot. Others say

the cops pushed into the group of picketers first. Another version holds

that a longshoreman had jumped the gun, but the local police -- who were

holding the line against the protest -- were doing just fine until a state

officer further back ordered a second phalanx of armed cops to charge the

picketers. Riley says that he stepped in the middle to calm the situation,

and was clubbed on the head.



<p>Whatever the spark, the fight was on -- although, given the imbalance in

numbers and firepower, the fracas was fairly brief. All in all, the skirmish

itself was a relatively minor footnote in the nation's history of bloody

labor battles. Yet the morning after, a dispirited mood hung over the port

city. Unlike elsewhere in South Carolina, labor had earned the respect of

the Charleston authorities, who in the cut-throat dockside world knew the

instrumental role organized longshoremen played in maintaining the port's

prosperity. According to one observer, "both sides felt bad that it had come

to this."



<p>It was a testament to the understanding between the union and authorities

that the local police decided against aggressively pursuing charges. Nine

workers were arrested for trespassing -- misdemeanor charges that were later

dropped for lack of evidence.





<p>WHAT THE CHARLESTON longshoremen could not have calculated is the role that

political ambition would play in determining their fate -- namely, the

political ambitions of South Carolina's Attorney General, Charlie Condon.



<p>Condon had grown up in Charleston, and by his 20s was fast becoming a

darling in Democratic Party circles. Sensing a shift in the political winds,

he turned Republican. Condon's years as Attorney General have been

distinguished by his ravenous appetite for media attention -- including his

publicity-grabbing, if legally questionable, law-and-order crusades,

including those stripping the right of accused criminals to appeals, and

most recently, campaigns to jail drug-addicted expecting mothers for "child

abuse" against unborn fetuses. He may be the only state Attorney General in

the nation who has lost every case he has brought before the federal Supreme

Court (three so far) on 9-0 decisions.



<p>In the case of the Charleston longshoremen, Condon saw political gold. A

crackdown on the ILA would not only bolster his law-and-order credentials,

but make a similarly clear statement about the place of blacks and workers

in Condon's South Carolina, where he announced his intention to run for

governor this past March.



<p>Such ambitions explain why, in February of last year, as Charleston

authorities were quietly letting the cases against the dock workers slide,

that South Carolina television viewers were treated to an unusually strident

piece of political propaganda. With George W. Bush and John McCain trading

blows for the state's presidential primary, Condon broadcast a now-infamous

campaign ad, endorsing Bush and promising "jail, jail and more jail" for the

shipyard workers. What bearing the presidential race had on the Charleston

labor battle wasn't mentioned, but the ultimate message was clear: a vote

for Bush was a vote against the ILA.



<p>Bush won South Carolina. And Condon soon set to work to make good on his

political promise. The state singled out what were to become the Charleston

Five and served them with a laundry list of charges, including felony

rioting, conspiracy to riot, two assault cases, and resisting arrest. The

accused are currently under house arrest, which requires them to stay at

home from 7 p.m. to 7 a.m.; the felony riot charges alone carry up to five

years of potential jail time.



<p>As for Nordana, they joined with WSI -- a stevedoring company, that supplies

the non-union workers -- to sue Local 1422 and their sister union, checkers

and clerks Local 1771, $1.5 million in alleged financial losses. But last

April, the unions bargained with Nordana to establish a new "small boat

agreement" which holds union wage levels, but which loosens union standards

for hours and staffing levels. Upon reaching the agreement, Nordana dropped

out of the civil suit and encouraged WSI to do the same -- but WSI instead

added 27 more ILA picketers to the suit, which it is still pursuing.





<p>THE MORE the state presses, the more determined the opposition -- rooted in

labor-community coalitions and far-reaching solidarity networks unique to

Southern organizing -- seems to become. A growing number of unions

nationally are pledging support; the ILA and ILWU, longshore unions often at

odds, have joined forces behind the Charleston Five banner; and a Swedish

representative of the International Dockworkers Council promises that

workers will shut down ports across Europe if justice isn't served.



<p>Back on the Charleston waterfront, the port is still humming. The

dockworkers of Local 1422, including the Charleston Five, are back at work,

loading and unloading the fortunes of the global South. But the city is

haunted -- by a new consciousness of labor's power to shape shipyard

economics, by fear of what this power, tied to freedom and worker struggles

the world over, may spell for the South's future.



<p>Through the Charleston waterfront and the mind of the South, the ghost of

Denmark Vesey blows still.
