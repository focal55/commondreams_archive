Eric Zorn of the Chicago Tribune told the story the other day of 

              the fellow from Oakland who tried to take advantage of Nike&#146;s 

              offer to personalize his expensive sneakers with a "Nike iD."

<P>The giant shoe company, which is currently sucking in money from 

              yet another "Air Jordan" shoe it has designed for gullible teenagers, 

              would allow customers to have words custom-stitched under its trademark 

              swoosh.</P>

<P>Jonah Peretti, who is a graduate student at the Massachusetts Institute 

              of Technology, asked that his Nike iD be "Sweatshop."</P>

<P>Alas, Peretti heard back from Nike: "Your Nike iD order was canceled 

              for one or more of the following reasons: 1. Your Personal iD contains 

              another party&#146;s trademark or other intellectual property; 2. 

              Your Personal iD contains the name of an athlete or team we do not 

              have the legal right to use; 3. Your Personal iD was left blank. 

              Did you not want any personalization? 4. Your personal iD contains 

              profanity or inappropriate slang, and besides, your mother would 

              slap us."</P>

<P>The MIT student wrote back that his iD didn&#146;t violate any 

              of the four criteria.</P>

<P>"I chose the iD because I wanted to remember the toil and labor 

              of the children that made my shoes. Could you please ship them to 

              me immediately?" he replied.</P>

<P>Undaunted, Nike replied to Peretti: "Your Nike iD order was canceled 

              because the iD you have chosen contains ... inappropriate slang."</P>

<P>According to Zorn, that sent Peretti to the dictionary.</P>

<P>"After consulting Webster&#146;s Dictionary, I discovered that 

              &#145;sweatshop&#146; is in fact part of standard English and not 

              slang," he told Nike. "Your Web site advertises that the Nike iD 

              program is &#145;about freedom to choose and freedom to express 

              who you are.&#146; I share Nike&#146;s love of freedom and personal 

              expression.</P>

<P>"The site also says that &#145;If you want it done right, build 

              it yourself,&#146; " he continued. "I was thrilled to be able to 

              build my own shoes and my personal iD was offered as a small token 

              of appreciation for the sweatshop workers poised to help me realize 

              my vision. I hope that you will value my freedom of expression and 

              reconsider your decision to reject my order."</P>

<P>But, Nike wouldn&#146;t budge. When Zorn contacted a company spokeswoman, 

              she finally fessed up the real reason Nike rejected Peretti&#146;s 

              request: "We simply will not put something on our own product that 

              puts us in a defamatory light."</P>

<P>Peretti finally decided to give up on getting "sweatshop" stitched 

              onto his sneakers. Instead he wrote:</P>

<P>"I have decided to order the shoes with a different iD, but I would 

              like to make one small request. Could you please send me a color 

              snapshot of the 10-year-old Vietnamese girl who makes my shoes?"</P>

<P>He never got a response.
