Federal tax policy isn’t sexy.  But it is important.



<p>President Bush recently said that his “tax relief for everybody” can help 

counter the current economic slump in America.  The unease of Mr. Dow and 

Mr. Jones and millions of hourly workers is hard to miss.  Our new president 

has a solution: a $1.6 trillion, 10-year tax cut that would return people’s 

money to them—$1,600 for the average American family—where it belongs.



<p>It’s no secret that the top 1 percent of high income taxpayers would reap 43 

percent of the savings from the president’s tax plan.  However, the class 

bias of his tax policy is as it should be, GOP leaders say.



<p>"People who have substantial amounts of money are going to take any tax 

break they get and reinvest in America's economy," said Treasury Secre-tary 

Paul O’Neill on CBS' "The Early Show."



<p>What Mr. O’Neill means by the American economy matters.  Is he, for 

instance, referring to financial speculation or industrial production?



<p>On a related note, why would the wealthy reinvest their tax savings from 

Bush’s plan in, say, the manufacturing sector of the American economy, now 

bogged down by excess inventory?  This backlog of unsold goods has in part 

caused a rising tide of layoffs in manufacturing, site of nearly half the 

job cuts in fourth-quarter 2000, a Labor De-partment report found.



<p>Mr. O’ Neill’s claim that the president’s tax plan would spur invest-ment in 

the American economy would perhaps be more persuasive if sup-ported by 

evidence.  For instance, where is the data that weak invest-ment is what 

ails American makers of cars or computers?



<p>Which brings us to Mr. Bush’s definition of “everybody” under his tax-cut 

plan?  What of the working-poor and their family members?  There are 

approximately 12.2 million of them who will get no tax savings at all under 

the president’s proposal, according to the Center for Budget and Policy 

Priorities.  The “everybody” President Bush speaks about should include 

those Americans suffering most from income inequality.



<p>The annual income of the lowest paid American workers could change if they 

did benefit from the president’s tax plan.  This would do many things.  One 

is to increase their buying power.  Such an outcome would, in turn, help 

boost the bottom lines of businesses big and small weighed down with unsold 

goods.



<p>Common sense dictates that increased income for low-wage American workers 

will improve consumer confidence.  And consumption spending accounts for 

two-thirds of the American economy.



<p>As Mr. O’ Neill correctly notes, the American economy relies on the buying 

power of consumers.  They are the driving force behind the eco-nomic 

expansion that began in first-quarter 1991 and may be coming to a close 10 

years later.



<p>Meanwhile, the nation’s economic growth hasn’t exactly been robust on Main 

Street.  The economic downturn in December and January has in part helped 

sink some share prices on Wall Street. Just ask Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan, 

who recently said that, “changes in stock market wealth have become a more 

important determinant of shifts in consumer spending relative to changes in 

current household income than was the case just five to seven years ago.”



<p>Moreover, the $1,600 in tax savings for the average American household 

trotted out by the Bush administration is inaccurate, notes Max Sawicky of 

the Economic Policy Institute.  He explains that less than 11 percent of 

taxpayers would get that amount or more.



<p>Well, one thing is clear.  The smaller the annual income of a low-wage 

worker, the less she can purchase.  The bigger her buying power, the less 

excess capacity in the American economy.  Much hangs in the balance.
