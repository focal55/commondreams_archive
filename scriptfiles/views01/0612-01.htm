THE FEDERAL justice system provided the pulpit and a 19th-century

Victorian poet named William Ernest Henley supplied the sermon that Timothy

James McVeigh tried to preach on the day he was executed for the Oklahoma City

bombing that killed 168 people, including 19 children.

<P>

    McVeigh left Henley's poem, "Invictus," as his final living testimony. It

was a sermon he must have hoped would sum up the meaning of the 1995 bombing,

which he always maintained was a patriotic rather than a murderous act.

<P>

    His attempted use of Henley's 1875 poem as a sermon, however, misuses

Henley and reveals McVeigh's twisted mindset of anger, arrogance and defiant

resignation to his fate, concluding with these final lines of the poem: "I am

the master of my fate: I am the captain of my soul."

    Back when school children memorized poems, "Invictus" was popular in the

classroom, perhaps because it appeals to the childlike-and ultimately

futile-desire in all of us not to have to rely on anything or anyone beyond

ourselves. Born in Gloucester, England, in 1849, Henley suffered the lifelong

burden of tubercular arthritis. In his poem, he thanks "whatever gods may be

for my unconquerable soul," an agnostic suggestion that not only is life cruel,

but it must be endured alone.

<P>

    For those of us who do not approve of the death penalty, not even for

heinous crimes of this magnitude, there was a pragmatic as well as amoral

reason for not executing McVeigh. He was a human specimen needing more study, a

living testimony of individualism gone very wrong. He expressed no regret for

his crime and sought no spiritual solace beyond himself in his final hours.

<P>

What is the source and motive of such a gross human error? In McVeigh's case,

we now can only speculate.

<P>

    McVeigh's murderous act was intended, or so he said, to serve as an act of

revenge against the United States government for the deaths that took place

during the 1993 siege of the Branch Davidian compound in Waco, Texas. The

families at Waco were motivated, they claimed, by religious zeal.

<P>

    In contrast, McVeigh's act of defiance was inspired not by religion but by

his identification with the individualism and defiant attitude against

authority by the Branch Davidian leaders.

<P>

    Individualism gone bad can be an ugly sight. A familiar example can be

found in the 1956 movie, "The Searchers." Its director, John Ford, was one of

the first Hollywood film directors to break out of the Western film

formula-which in his early years he helped define-by revealing that the heroic

lone gunman of the West was too often motivated more by defiance and anger than

by a sense of justice.

<P>

    In "The Searchers," Ford gives his John Wayne character (Ethan Edwards) a

motivation for revenge-the murder of his brother, his sister-in-law and three

of their children by a roving band of Comanches. The film traces Ethan's search

for the lone surviving family member, Debbie, and for Scar, the Comanche chief

who led the raid and kidnaped Debbie.

<P>

    In his smoldering rage, extended over the seven years of the search, Ethan

determines not only to kill Scar, but to kill Debbie as well because as the

wife of an Indian, she is now "defiled." The film concludes with Scar's death,

but not Debbie's, for Edwards, coming to his senses, sweeps her up in his arms

with the classic John Wayne line, "Let's go home, Debbie."

    Through this film, Ford tries to set parameters. In warfare, the enemy is

the enemy soldier. But the Debbies of the world are not the enemy. Until he

comes to his senses, Ethan had forgotten that fact; driven by racism,

arrogance, anger and his defiant individualism, Ethan fully intended to execute

her.

<P>

    Timothy McVeigh's distorted understanding of the individual's mandate to

correct injustice gave him what he believed to be justification to slay

whatever victims were in his way as he employed what he termed a "legit tactic"

in the Oklahoma City bombing. What McVeigh refused to allow to seep into his

consciousness, however, was the fact that individualism has its limits set by

the larger communities of which we are all a part.

<P>

    McVeigh could have had his avenues of expression to protest Waco and to

argue for the right of citizens to bear arms. But McVeigh belonged to no

community, except the community of hate. He chose not to protest nor to shout

out his disagreement with his government. Instead, he withdrew into himself and

operating out of an individual defiance as the "master of his fate" and the

"captain of his soul," he designated himself sole executor of innocent victims.

<P>

    Now that he is dead, we may never learn when McVeigh encountered William

Ernest Henley's poem. Was it in prison, or earlier? Either way, he misused

Henley, whose poem did not express defiance against society but testified to

the poet's acceptance of a lifelong physical suffering. Henley's understanding

of survival is a lonely expression of individualism. McVeigh's use of Henley's

poem, on the other hand, is just the last petty act of a twisted soul who is

now in the hands, in Henley's phrase, of "whatever gods may be."
