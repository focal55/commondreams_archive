Anyone's who read a news magazine or watched even a modicum of television in the past two weeks might well be forgiven for assuming that sharks have suddenly become media literate.
<P>For eons we've been told that these denizens of the deep appear to be dumber than W at a European summit. But stop the presses, folks -- this just in: Sharks bite! And, they do so in an exquisitely timed manner. </P>
<P>How else to explain that just as Time magazine placed the bloodied face of a shark on its cover a few weeks ago, those mysterious attacks off the coast of Florida began to increase? Have sharks progressed so far up the evolutionary ladder that their mental processes now rival those of the average PR mogul? Or has marine life suddenly become schooled in branding techniques that would be the envy of Mrs. Paul? If so, what exactly were you and I doing that caused us to miss so awesome an upheaval in the great Chain of Being?</P>
<P>Back in the day, coincidences like this one would have been branded a Communist plot, and a congressional committee would have spent a small fortune on an investigation revealing that the true culprit behind the attacks was Fidel Castro. But where's a Bolshevik when you really need one? Nowadays, everyone's so busy consuming that no one has any overarching philosophy at the ready to explain the inexplicable, whether it's fluoridation, UFOs or shark attacks.</P>
<P>Still, there's more than a little of the "It's the end of the world!" hysteria in the quality of the media coverage. </P>
<P>In the last three weeks Time, CNN and CNN Headline News in particular have been pedaling shark-bites-man stories with barely concealed glee. In fact, those perpetual helicam shots of sharks frolicking in the Atlantic would qualify CNN to rename itself the Cousteau Nautical Network. The ignominy runneth over on Headline News, where seasoned news anchor Chuck Roberts was forced to read the following copy going into a break: "and, when we come back, we'll take a look at what happens when sharks get together to party!" No, I don't think we will.</P>
<P>Media feeding frenzy</P>
<P>I smell something more pungent here than week-old grouper guts wrapped in the National Enquirer. Because the fact is, people bite other people <I>100 times </I>more frequently than do sharks in the United States -- and that's with Mike Tyson out of the country. There's more behind this particular media feeding frenzy than meets the eye. </P>
<P>Turns out, sharks sell. Go to the Discovery Channel Web site and you'll quickly learn why.</P>
<P>There you can watch sharks in 3-D and take a wild ride on the Shark Cam (I kid you not). You'll love something called Ring of Death, an interactive game in which the viewer can personally escort baby South African fur seals through shark infested waters. You're given a contingent of six adorable pups to start the journey. Get a question wrong and, oops, here comes a shark, which devours the baby seal. And you're responsible because you gave the wrong answer! Perfect for the kids, don't you think?</P>
<P>In case you didn't get your fill, there are two pages of shark-related products you can purchase, from videos to T-shirts to stereoscopic 3-D shark glasses.</P>
<P>Discovery Channel PR people proudly explained that Shark Week is their most popular attraction and that it draws "the lowest median age viewer" of any of their special weeks. I'm all in favor of reality programming, but Shark Week and the related media hysteria fail to tell the whole story.</P>
<P>The obsessive nature of the coverage seems, in fact, to invite off-the-deep-end responses from viewers: like inviting friends over to celebrate the end of Shark Week with a Friday night fish fry, which qualifies as a strange mixture of piscatory escatology or post-modern lunacy, take your pick. </P>
<P>Either way, two issues come to mind.</P>
<P>First, reporting that sharks bite (duh!) or even that shark attacks have increased without immediately mentioning and emphasizing the very rational explanation for this -- that more people are invading the shark's natural habitat -- is yet another example of hyping the news. </P>
<P>By hyping, I mean carefully selecting sensational details and placing them in the most prominent position (headlines, up-front body copy, or in graphic displays on television), thus encouraging readers and viewers to reach shocking but erroneous conclusions.</P>
<P>Ask a news exec to justify this and he or she will tell you that the "news" is that sharks are, indeed, biting more people. Some will even claim the reports are a public service. But that's taking the news out of context. The headline here is that humanity is expanding its incursion into places it has never been and is doing so in record numbers. </P>
<P>However, leading with that story won't create the same sensational effect. Because the imagined randomness of these mysterious shark attacks, as currently portrayed in the media, taps more deeply into our primal fears, reviving images of ancient evil lurking around the shoals of our consciousness.</P>
<P>The hyped and slanted media coverage activates ancient survival mechanisms that are so hidden we scarcely notice them. Those mechanisms may not provoke us to flight or fight as they might have done in the bad old days. Instead, they are likely to prompt many in Western society to do something counterintuitive -- to buy like crazy.</P>
<P>It is perhaps too much to say that exaggerated reports of shark attacks have become proxies for the very real but taboo economic story of our day: Recession. No one wants to say the R word, but symbolizing it through shark attacks achieves a dual purpose -- it articulates the mysterious sense of dread we may feel without actually naming it, and it stimulates us to buy without even knowing why. Shark consumes man; man consumes everything else.</P>
<P>In the end, this is just another summer fish story, and exaggerations about shark attacks probably won't hurt anyone. But it's always good to remind ourselves that the news isn't a natural product. It's manufactured each day and, when the stakes are higher and the subject matter is more complex, news that prompts boundless consumption can be downright indigestible.</P>
