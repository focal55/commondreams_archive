When world leaders meet this week to discuss the fight against

global AIDS, the real questions will be how to finance the war and who

will provide such financing, especially in Africa, where 70% of the

world's 35 million people living with HIV or AIDS are struggling to stay

alive. Unless the external debts of African countries are canceled

outright this year, any overall strategy to defeat AIDS will surely fail.

<p>To suggest that Africa can even survive the onslaught of AIDS with a

scattering of philanthropy, while continuing to pay far greater amounts

to international financial institutions, is a cruel fantasy.

<p>The Global AIDS Fund, launched in April by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi

Annan, is an important vehicle for financing the treatment and prevention

activities necessary to defeat AIDS. Yet, as the world's richest

countries falter in coming forward with adequate contributions to reach

the fund's modest target of $10 billion, they are neglecting the most

obvious way to enable African countries to tackle the crisis themselves.

If the richest creditor nations and institutions in human history are

serious about confronting the worst plague in human history, they must

cancel Africa's debt and remove the major economic obstacle to African

efforts to fight AIDS.

<p>Africa's external debt now tops $300 billion, costing its governments

more than $13 billion annually in debt service payments. The result is

that they have paid more in debt service to the World Bank, International

Monetary Fund and rich governments during the past two decades than they

have received in development assistance or in new loans. As a result,

African governments have been forced to divert more and more money from

basic social services to the debts. Africa's debt burden has led to a

dramatic decline in human development indicators (such as life

expectancy) and an increase in extreme poverty and has contributed to the

loss of more than 16 million lives to AIDS.

<p>Debt cancellation would immediately permit a greater financial

commitment from African governments to tackle the crisis. At April's

HIV/AIDS summit in Abuja, Nigeria, African leaders demonstrated their

commitment to fighting the pandemic by agreeing on a target of spending

at least 15% of their national budgets on health, two or three times

current levels. A recent study of countries that have received some debt

relief illustrates that the majority of the resources freed up have gone

to health and education and to combating the AIDS crisis. Debt

cancellation would make a real difference.

<p>Canceling Africa's foreign debt is also affordable. Recent studies

show that the World Bank and IMF could easily absorb the write-off

without negatively affecting their credit rating, while the treasuries of

rich creditor countries already hold the debt on their books at a vastly

discounted rate (10% of the actual figure) in tacit acknowledgment that

poor countries will never be able to repay the full amount anyway.

<p>It is time to face facts. Money is being drained out of Africa far

more quickly than it is trickling in. Without definitive debt

cancellation, new funding to combat HIV/AIDS, while desperately needed,

will be wholly inadequate. Unless African governments control their own

resources and can direct spending toward health care infrastructure and

delivery systems and prevention and treatment programs, international

donations will do little in the face of the raging pandemic.

<p>If the debt is not canceled, the fight against AIDS in Africa will

surely be lost.
