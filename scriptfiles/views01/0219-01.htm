            Two groups of researchers released the formal report of data for the 

            human genome last Monday — on the birthday of Charles Darwin, who 

            jump-started our biological understanding of life's nature and evolution 

            when he published "The Origin of Species" in 1859. On Tuesday, and 

            for only the second time in 35 years of teaching, I dropped my intended 

            schedule — to discuss the importance of this work with my undergraduate 

            course on the history of life. (The only other case, in a distant 

            age of the late 60's, fell a half-hour after radical students had 

            seized University Hall and physically ejected the deans; this time 

            at least, I told my students, the reason for the change lay squarely 

            within the subject matter of the course!) 

            <P> I am no lover, or master, of sound bites or epitomes, but I began 

              by telling my students that we were sharing a great day in the history 

              of science and of human understanding in general.</P>

            <P> The fruit fly Drosophila, the staple of laboratory genetics, possesses 

              between 13,000 and 14,000 genes. The roundworm C. elegans, the staple 

              of laboratory studies in development, contains only 959 cells, looks 

              like a tiny formless squib with virtually no complex anatomy beyond 

              its genitalia, and possesses just over 19,000 genes.</P>

            <P> The general estimate for Homo sapiens — sufficiently large to 

              account for the vastly greater complexity of humans under conventional 

              views — had stood at well over 100,000, with a more precise figure 

              of 142,634 widely advertised and considered well within the range 

              of reasonable expectation. Homo sapiens possesses between 30,000 

              and 40,000 genes, with the final tally almost sure to lie nearer 

              the lower figure. In other words, our bodies develop under the directing 

              influence of only half again as many genes as the tiny roundworm 

              needs to manufacture its utter, if elegant, outward simplicity.</P>

            <P> Human complexity cannot be generated by 30,000 genes under the 

              old view of life embodied in what geneticists literally called (admittedly 

              with a sense of whimsy) their "central dogma": DNA makes RNA makes 

              protein — in other words, one direction of causal flow from code 

              to message to assembly of substance, with one item of code (a gene) 

              ultimately making one item of substance (a protein), and the congeries 

              of proteins making a body. Those 142,000 messages no doubt exist, 

              as they must to build our bodies' complexity, with our previous 

              error now exposed as the assumption that each message came from 

              a distinct gene.</P>

            <P> We may envision several kinds of solutions for generating many 

              times more messages (and proteins) than genes, and future research 

              will target this issue. In the most reasonable and widely discussed 

              mechanism, a single gene can make several messages because genes 

              of multicellular organisms are not discrete strings, but composed 

              of coding segments (exons) separated by noncoding regions (introns). 

              The resulting signal that eventually assembles the protein consists 

              only of exons spliced together after elimination of introns. If 

              some exons are omitted, or if the order of splicing changes, then 

              several distinct messages can be generated by each gene.</P>

            <P> The implications of this finding cascade across several realms. 

              The commercial effects will be obvious, as so much biotechnology, 

              including the rush to patent genes, has assumed the old view that 

              "fixing" an aberrant gene would cure a specific human ailment. The 

              social meaning may finally liberate us from the simplistic and harmful 

              idea, false for many other reasons as well, that each aspect of 

              our being, either physical or behavioral, may be ascribed to the 

              action of a particular gene "for" the trait in question.</P>

            <P> But the deepest ramifications will be scientific or philosophical 

              in the largest sense. From its late 17th century inception in modern 

              form, science has strongly privileged the reductionist mode of thought 

              that breaks overt complexity into constituent parts and then tries 

              to explain the totality by the properties of these parts and simple 

              interactions fully predictable from the parts. ("Analysis" literally 

              means to dissolve into basic parts). The reductionist method works 

              triumphantly for simple systems — predicting eclipses or the motion 

              of planets (but not the histories of their complex surfaces), for 

              example. But once again — and when will we ever learn? — we fell 

              victim to hubris, as we imagined that, in discovering how to unlock 

              some systems, we had found the key for the conquest of all natural 

              phenomena. Will Parsifal ever learn that only humility (and a plurality 

              of strategies for explanation) can locate the Holy Grail?</P>

            <P> The collapse of the doctrine of one gene for one protein, and 

              one direction of causal flow from basic codes to elaborate totality, 

              marks the failure of reductionism for the complex system that we 

              call biology — and for two major reasons.</P>

            <P> First, the key to complexity is not more genes, but more combinations 

              and interactions generated by fewer units of code — and many of 

              these interactions (as emergent properties, to use the technical 

              jargon) must be explained at the level of their appearance, for 

              they cannot be predicted from the separate underlying parts alone. 

              So organisms must be explained as organisms, and not as a summation 

              of genes.</P>

            <P> Second, the unique contingencies of history, not the laws of physics, 

              set many properties of complex biological systems. Our 30,000 genes 

              make up only 1 percent or so of our total genome. The rest — including 

              bacterial immigrants and other pieces that can replicate and move 

              — originate more as accidents of history than as predictable necessities 

              of physical laws. Moreover, these noncoding regions, disrespectfully 

              called "junk DNA," also build a pool of potential for future use 

              that, more than any other factor, may establish any lineage's capacity 

              for further evolutionary increase in complexity.</P>

            <P> The deflation of hubris is blessedly positive, not cynically disabling. 

              The failure of reductionism doesn't mark the failure of science, 

              but only the replacement of an ultimately unworkable set of assumptions 

              by more appropriate styles of explanation that study complexity 

              at its own level and respect the influences of unique histories. 

              Yes, the task will be much harder than reductionistic science imagined. 

              But our 30,000 genes — in the glorious ramifications of their irreducible 

              interactions — have made us sufficiently complex and at least potentially 

              adequate for the task ahead.</P>

            <P>  We may best succeed in this effort if we can heed some memorable 

              words spoken by that other great historical figure born on Feb. 

              12 — on the very same day as Darwin, in 1809. Abraham Lincoln, in 

              his first Inaugural Address, urged us to heal division and seek 

              unity by marshaling the "better angels of our nature" — yet another 

              irreducible and emergent property of our historically unique mentality, 

              but inherent and invokable all the same, even though not resident 

              within, say, gene 26 on chromosome number 12.</P>
