President Bush's war planners have struggled to find a fitting code name for

our latest military venture. But after a week of war, there's only one

appropriate label for the nightmare that has transpired: Operation Infinite

Disaster.



<p>Leave aside, for the moment, the moral shortcomings and Orwellian

implications of bombing starved people to "fight for freedom" or honor the

dead of the September 11 tragedy. What's even more striking about the War

Against ... Somebody is that, even on the Bush administration's own terms,

the bombing of Afghanistan has thus far been a failure -- a series of

tactical blunders guaranteed to make a bad situation much, much worse.



<p>A quick inventory of the week's events tell the story:



<p>BOMBING PEOPLE WITH FOOD: The first sign of trouble was news that Bush -- in

a move to give the brutal bombings a humanitarian spin -- had opted to drop

food supplies along with cluster bombs. This public relations stunt quickly

backfired, however, when every major relief agency in the world derided the

drops for 1) being insufficient (enough to feed about .5% of the starving

population for a single day, provided the rations got to the intended

"targets"); 2) containing food Afghan people never eat (hello, peanut

butter?!); and 3) having the disadvantage of landing in fields strewn with

land mines, adding injury to insult.



<p>HIGH-TECH STRIKES IN A LOW-TECH WORLD: Then came evidence that U.S. bombs

are hitting worthless targets -- when they hit at all. This may surprise

U.S. readers, who, much like during the Gulf War, have been treated to giddy

media reports cooing over the Pentagon's high-tech "smart" weaponry:

gee-whiz gadgets like satellite targeting which supposedly make military

strikes "surgical" -- and blood-free. (Although, in 1991 the Pentagon

admitted that under six percent of Gulf War weapons used "smart"

technology -- and even among these brilliant bombs, fully 20% missed their

mark.)



<p>The Pentagon says they've gotten better; time -- if not the media -- will

tell. But what have these intelligent machines of destruction been hitting?

A few terrorist training camps, which, as journalist Robert Fisk noted, our

planes had "no difficulty spotting ... because, of course, most of them were

built by the CIA when Mr. bin Laden and his men were the good guys."



<p>But overall, the Taliban is a low-tech army -- and bombing their outdated

airstrips and archaic phone systems has had little impact on how they

control their terrain. And technology is only as good as the fallible humans

who use it, which leads to the next mistake:



<p>KILLING INNOCENT PEOPLE: "Serious blunders by American warplanes may have

killed at least 100 civilians in Afghanistan," according to eye-witness

accounts obtained by The Observer of London and reported on Sunday, October

14. (U.S. newspapers have been slow to report evidence of innocent people

dying.) These deaths -- in Karam village, 18 miles west of Jalalabad --

came after news of the four workers killed in a U.N. building devoted to

clearing land mines.



<p>A total of 400 civilian deaths have been confirmed. Personal testimony from

fleeing refugees suggest hundreds more.



<p>What has been the effect of these deaths, besides belying the notion that

war can be waged without ending innocent lives? According to The Guardian of

London, the Karam killings are straining ties between the U.S. and its shaky

allies in the anti-terrorism coalition.



<p>And among the Arab and Muslim populace, the response is predictable:

"Reports of between 50 and 150 deaths" the Guardian reports, have "provoked

rage and grief throughout Afghanistan and throughout the Muslim world."



<p>Which brings us to what the U.S.-led strikes *have * succeeded in doing:



<p>IGNITING AN EXPLOSIVE BACKLASH: I'm not referring to the 30,000 protesters

who marched in England against the U.S.-led bombing, the 70,000 who marched

in India, the 70,000 who marched in Germany, or similar protests which have

filled the streets in "friendly" turf like Italy, Greece, and our own

cities.





<p>I'm also not referring to the boomerang response to U.S. bombing in the form

of terrorist counter-attacks, which have plunged America into dread fear of

powdery envelopes and exposed nuclear reactors.



<p>No, more troubling are the 20,000 students who took over the streets of

Egypt yelling "U.S. go to hell!" The Jakarta Muslims threatening to kill

U.S. tourists and embassy workers. The millions of Arab-Americans and

Muslims who are raging -- violently -- against the U.S. in Jordan, South

Africa, Iran, Bangladesh, Pakistan (brought to the brink of civil war) and

Nigeria, where "hundreds" may be dead due to rioting.



<p>President Bush's reaction has instilled little confidence. When asked in a

press conference last Friday for his response to the vitriolic hatred that

has mushroomed around the globe, Bush could only mumble: "I'm amazed. I just

can't believe it because I know how good we are" -- which, in the world's

eyes, must bring profoundly new meaning to the word "naivet&eacute;."



<p>This disheartening string of missteps, feeding an upswell of moral outrage,

led everyone's favorite war-watching website -- <a href="http://www.debka.com" target="_new">www.debka.com</a> -- to post

this headline over the weekend: "First Week of U.S. Offensive in Afghanistan

is Inconclusive Militarily, Earthshaking Geo-Politically."



<p>And for what? To the Pentagon's dismay, Bin Laden hasn't been "flushed out."

The Taliban isn't waving a white flag. Our supposed allies, the

opium-running North Alliance, seem confused about whether or not they should

take over the country.



<p>Amidst such chaos, the Bush camp has resorted to the time-tested tactic of

creating a diversion, suggesting the blame for September 11 may lay

elsewhere -- Iraq (surprise) being the favorite fall guy. This comes just

weeks after every media mouthpiece instructed us that "ONLY the resources

and skills of Osama bin Laden" and the "al-Quaeda network" could have been

responsible.



<p>The U.S. may or may not be able to reverse its miserable military fortunes

in Afghanistan. But the more dangerous consequences of the U.S. bombing

campaign -- a world aroused into anger against American arrogance, in part

the very reason for the September 11 tragedy -- will stay with us for a very

long time.
