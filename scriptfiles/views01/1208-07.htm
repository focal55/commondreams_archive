Once again

the Bush Administration has warned the American public about the

possibility of terrorist attacks and has put law enforcement officials

around the country on “the highest alert.” This is the third time since

September 11 that the Administration has issued such a warning. <p>

As before,

the Administration has given out no information about where, how, or when

the terrorists might strike. Law enforcement officials complained during

the first two alerts that the warnings were too vague to allow them to

counter the threats. Of the current alert, all that Homeland Security

Director Tom Ridge has said is that “the sources are more credible and

... the decibel level is higher as they [the terrorists] talk about

potential attacks.”<p>

I bet I'm

not the only one who thinks that something's fishy. If government

agencies - or their informants -- are listening to terrorists hatching

plans, then they ought to have some hint as to their identities and

intentions. Why won't they tell, at least other law enforcement

agencies?<p>

The

Administration is obviously in a bind. If terrorists strike, it will be

blamed for a lack of preparedness. If the terrorists don't strike, as we

all fervently hope, Administration leaders will not necessarily be

credited as saviors. Maybe there was no threat. If this happens too many

times, people might perceive them as crying “wolf” too often, or as

promoting a crisis without any evidence. <p>

Credibility

is everything. Is this an authentic alert or simply a scare tactic to

advance the Administration’s agenda? I assume the scare is real because

it will likely deter travel and keep people out of malls and other public

places. That’s neither good for the economy nor good for the

Administration’s own long-term political fortunes. On the other hand,

Administration officials were quoted, December 4, as saying that Ridge

pushed for the alert not only because of “new information” but because

the “public, politicians, and police were getting complacent.” Ridge

himself said, “The further removed we get from September 11, I think the

natural tendency is to let down our guard.” The Administration has much

to gain from sustaining the crisis. It has an aggressive foreign policy

to pursue as well as a repressive law enforcement agenda. <p>

In foreign

policy, the Administration speaks with a forked tongue. “There may be

need to use military troops elsewhere .... we’re keeping all our options

on the table,” President Bush has said. Two competing strategies are

articulated: 1) cooperating with the United Nations in building an

international coalition against terrorism, or 2) going it alone,

unilaterally attacking any country that we, without any international

corroboration or support, define as terrorist. <p>

On the one

hand Secretary of State Colin Powell is building an international

coalition. So far he’s been successful. Most recently he was in Turkey, a

Muslim nation and NATO ally, offering assurances that the U.S. has no

<i>immediate</i> plans to attack Iraq, Turkey’s neighbor. The Turks are

slated to play an important role in wooing other Muslim countries away

from fundamentalist extremism, but they are very much opposed to an

American attack on Iraq. Though such an attack would undermine Powell’s

internationalist efforts, he was unable to offer Turkey absolute

assurance that a war against Iraq was not in the planning. <p>

Other

voices within the Bush Administration boldly advocate “taking it to

Saddam.” Deputy Secretary of State Paul Wolfowitz has been calling for a

war against Iraq ever since September 11, regardless of international

opinion or evidence of Saddam Hussein’s complicity in the terrorism.

Publicly challenging Powell’s internationalism, Bush refuses to silence

Wolfowitz and break with his hawkish allies. Former Reagan advisor

Richard Perle, who has influence within the Administration, has written

that “if there is no Phase 2” in Bush’s strategy, “there can be no

victory in the war against terrorism.” Phase 2, Perle continues, means

unilaterally attacking Iraq or, if not Iraq, “Syria or Iran or Sudan or

Yemen or Somalia or North Korea or Lebanon or the Palestinian Authority.”

This is quite an agenda, guaranteed to turn the entire Muslim world

against us, as well as most if not all of our Western allies.<p>

The

anti-Iraq lobby accuses Saddam Hussein of making biological weapons, but

law enforcement and scientific authorities insist that the anthrax in the

postal system comes from American sources. As to Iraq’s weapons

capability, Scott Ritter, the UN’s chief weapons inspector in Iraq who

quit to protest President Clinton’s lack of resolve on this issue, told

<i>Fox News</i> that while Saddam remains “a little bit of a threat”

diplomatically and politically, he represents no threat to the United

States “in terms of real national security.” <p>

Given what

we know against what we've been told by the war hawks in the

Administration, can we trust Bush to honestly justify extending the war

to Iraq or other foreign countries? Is the current “high alert”

indicative of an actual threat, or is it a means of rousing the American

people to support an extended war? I don't know, but the Vietnam War’s

famous “Credibility Gap” is looming on the horizon. <p>

The U.S.

escalation in Vietnam was based on attacks by North Vietnamese patrol

boats on American destroyers in the Gulf of Tonkin. It’s now known that

President Lyndon Johnson knew that the “Tonkin Incident” was a lie, that

the attacks never happened. Cal Thomas - perhaps the most conservative

columnist in America - recently reviewed the Tonkin Incident in his

syndicated column. He concluded that “George McGovern was right,” as were

the other politicians and activists who “opposed the war.”<p>

It’s

credibility, stupid! It was lack of credibility that brought down the

Johnson Administration and helped undermine popular support for the

Vietnam War. The war against terrorism is inherently easy to support. But

President Bush has to be honest with the American people. If the

Administration is perceived as using the war as a cover to pursue its

partisan and ideological agenda, a showdown at Credibility Gap is just

around the corner.
