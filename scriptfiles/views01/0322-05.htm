Molly Ivins, the Texan who should have been elected president last 

              year, allows as how the big question of the current political moment 

              is not whether George W. Bush is a crooked appendage of corporate 

              America. Not even Republicans can deny that reality without giggling.

<P>The mystery of the moment is whether Democrats who are supposed 

              to be mounting the opposition to Bush are the other crooked appendage 

              of corporate America.</P>

<P>Ivins suggests that if Senate Democrat defectors kill campaign 

              finance reform in coming days, they will prove Green presidential 

              candidate Ralph Nader was right when he condemned both the Democrats 

              and Republicans as equally beyond redemption. "It&#146;s about whether 

              there are two political parties or one &#151; the Money Party," 

              argues Ivins. "Either the Democrats stand for something or they 

              don&#146;t, and if they stand for letting the current system of 

              legalized bribery continue, then we&#146;re better off voting for 

              Ralph Nader."</P>

<P>U.S. Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr., D-Ill., offers a similar message, 

              suggesting that if Democrats do not begin to mount a credible challenge 

              to Bush, they will prove Nader right. Former Labor Secretary Robert 

              Reich was even more blunt, suggesting that the Democratic response 

              to Bush proves the party of Roosevelt and Truman is now officially 

              "dead."</P>

<P>This sort of talk is music to the ears of David Cobb, a staff attorney 

              with the Community Legal Defense Fund in Houston and veteran Bush 

              battler. Don&#146;t get Cobb wrong, as a passionate foe of corporate 

              excess he wants to beat Bush and the Republicans. He just doesn&#146;t 

              believe the Democrats will ever rise to the challenge.</P>

<P>"There are a lot of good Democrats, progressive people who really 

              believe in all the right things," says Cobb. "But their views are 

              not being reflected by the national Democratic party leadership. 

              When Democrats in Washington sell out on basic issues like campaign 

              finance reform, Democrats at the grass-roots level start asking: 

              Where is the political opposition to these corporations going to 

              come from?"</P>

<P>Cobb is working with Madison&#146;s Ben Manski and others to build 

              the Green Party as a national political force &#151; in large part 

              because he has lost faith in the willingness of Democrats to stand 

              up to corporate campaign contributors. (An associate of the Program 

              on Corporations, Law and Democracy, he&#146;ll speak at 7 tonight 

              at the UW Memorial Union on how community groups are challenging 

              corporations on environmental, sweatshop and development issues.)</P>

<P>Like Ivins, Cobb thinks congressional Democrats face a critical 

              test this spring. If they fail to mount a credible and consistent 

              opposition to Bush, they will push millions of Americans to look 

              anew at the message carried by Nader and the Greens in last year&#146;s 

              campaign.</P>

<P>"When people who want a populist, passionate opposition to Bush 

              realize that the Democrats have let them down," says Cobb, "they&#146;ll 

              start to understand just how much America needs the Green Party."
