With some U.S. military aircraft broadcasting and others bombing, the United

States delivered its message of greed and violence to the people of

Afghanistan during the first week of the Islamic holy month of Ramadan.  An

airborne special forces radio station aboard an aircraft broadcast the

announcement of a $25 million dollar reward for information leading to the

location or capture of Osama bin Laden or bin Laden's chief lieutenant,

Aiman al-Zawahiri while American warplanes carried out heavy bombing strikes

around the populous city of Kandahar, a Taliban stronghold.   U.S. Defense

Secretary Donald Rumsfeld said the big money offer that is also being made

by dropping reward leaflets might entice the Afghans to "begin crawling

through those tunnels and caves looking for the bad folks."



<p>Under a headline of "America Will Take No Prisoners," the Times of London

reported on November 20 that Rumsfeld also said, "The United States is not

inclined to negotiate surrenders, nor are we in a position, with relatively

small numbers of forces on the ground, to take prisoners."  A Taliban

spokesman said they would "fight on" but had no idea of  Osama bin Laden's

whereabouts. U.S. General Tommy Franks said the U.S. would send in more

ground troops, including marines, to "destroy the terrorist network."



<p>The end game of the high tech destruction of the ruling Taliban's archaic

army in Afghanistan, and much of the impoverished nation's infrastructure

could be nearing.  Concurrently, a drumbeat has begun to crescendo for

renewed bombing and war against Iraq from the Bush Administration and its

political minions.  The estimated one-billion-dollar-a-month cost to U.S.

taxpayers of the Afghan action that directly benefits the defense industry

in its "War on Terrorism" bonanza could be diminished, so more targets are

needed  in "those nations that aid or harbor evil-doers."  Consequently, the

face of Osama bin Laden, the consummate evil villain of Bush II, is

beginning to morph back into the face of Saddam Hussein, the ultimate

evil-doer of Bush I.



<p>Under Secretary of State  John Bolton accused Iraq of building a germ

warfare arsenal at a biological weapons conference in Geneva even as stories

of home-grown anthrax producers surface and new leads point toward domestic

terrorism of the McVeigh variety in the anthrax mailings. U.S. Today

reported on November 19 that the "Defense Department strategists are

building a case for massive bombing of Iraq as a new phase of President

Bush's war against terrorism," under a front page headline of "Pentagon

builds case on Iraq."  In South Carolina on November 13, U.S. Rep. Lindsey

Graham said he supports "war against Iraq" at a fund-raiser in his campaign

to succeed Strom Thurmond in the U.S. Senate.  Isn't it time to consider

what happens to innocent children when we make war against these "monstrous

evil-doers?"



<p>Since the war against Iraq in 1991, deaths among babies and children have

more than doubled due to the use of depleted uranium bombs by the U.S.

causing birth defects and cancer and the U.S.-pushed economic sanctions

causing malnutrition and starvation.  Between 1970 and 1990 Iraq had

experienced unprecedented economic development.



<p>A United Nation's Children's Fund (UNICEF) spokesman, Alfred Ironside, told

me 120,000 Afghan children are in "immediate danger of death due to famine,

illness and cold."  On November 16, UNICEF issued a press release referring

to a 1997 study of child trauma in Kabul and compared it with anecdotal

evidence now emerging from the on-going United States attack on Afghanistan.

It said there were strong indications that long after the bombing and

fighting ends, the nightmare will continue for Afghan children.  The twenty

year conflict began when Afghanistan was invaded by the Soviet Union.  A

U.S. Central Intelligence Agency-sponsored resistance movement that included

a 22 year old son of a Saudi Arabian billionaire named Osama bin Laden was

formed to expel the Soviets.



<p>The UNICEF study conducted among several hundred children offer a hint of

what Afghan children are going through today.  Nearly 100% of the children

witnessed acts of violence during the fighting, two-thirds saw dead body

parts and nearly half of them saw multiple people killed in rocket and

artillery attacks.  As a result, 90% of the children said they worried about

what would happen to them in the future; 75% reported constant fear, even

when no immediate danger was present; over one half said they had difficulty

experiencing feelings of sadness or happiness of any kind; and 8 in 10

children reported they sometimes or often "feel so sad I can not cope with

life."



<p>In the prosperous U.S. that the "evil-doers" are said to envy so, the

Children's Defense Fund says that every 11 seconds, a child is neglected or

abused; every 44 seconds, a baby is born into poverty; every minute a baby

is born without health insurance; and every 2 and a half hours, a child is

killed by guns.  In South Carolina, 218,000 children have no health

insurance.



<p>President Bush's PR  folks have appropriated  the Children Defense Fund's

slogan of " Leave No Child Behind," but Bush refuses to see that the United

States is making war on children.
