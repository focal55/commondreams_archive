President Bush used a traditional Thanksgiving visit to a soup kitchen -- 

and new holiday TV ads -- to prod Americans last week to "dig a little deeper 

in their pocket" for neighborhood charities left wanting in the rush to aid 

terror victims. 

<p>



"I hope Americans will not substitute the gifts they've given in the 

aftermath of September 11 for neighborhood groups," said George W. 

<p>



There's no question, local charities are in trouble.  Post 9-11, donations 

are down and needs are up and nowhere is the confluence of crises worse than 

in New York. 

<p>



The city's largest food bank, Food for Survival, took a survey of the soup 

kitchens it serves in the days after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and 

found that 64 percent of the people receiving free food in New York were 

taking donations for the first time. "Most of these first-time clients were 

single mothers who needed emergency food because they had lost their jobs in 

the attack," Lucy Cabrera, the president of the food bank, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2001/11/21/nyregion/21PANT.html?" TARGET="NEW">told the New York 

Times</a>.

<p>



In the aftermath of the attacks, New York has -- officially -- lost over 

100,000 jobs, and with them, nearly that many health benefits. The city's 

jobseekers join a national line on which some eight million Americans stand 

right now, and that's just those that have been officially counted. 

<p>



But it was bleak around here before any terrorist attacked, unless you call the shredding of the social safety net an act of terror. 

<p>



Before Sept. 11, more than 1.5 million New Yorkers, including 510,000 

children, already relied on soup kitchens, food pantries and shelters to 

avoid going hungry. That story ran briefly, in the papers, back in August.

<p>



Mayor Giuliani is proud of having "shrunk" the welfare rolls by half. The 

City Bar Association, in its August report, noted that public assistance 

rolls dropped about 45 percent from where they stood in 1995, to 497,113 last 

July. During the same time, the number of people who in the course of a year 

obtained at least some emergency food relief tripled. 1.5 million equals one 

out of every five of us in New York.  The number of homeless New Yorkers 

using the shelter system hit 29,000 -- an all-time high --- <i>before</i> September 

11.

<p>



Bush tells Americans not to "substitute" their giving. We're to dig a little 

deeper to help our neighborhoods in need. But without debate, there was 

federal money for carpet-bombing and bunker-busting, dollars for daisy 

cutters and aircraft carriers, cash for deployment of special forces and Marines -- some 1,000 new ground troops were deployed in Afghanistan just this week.

<p>



The administration tells us we'll be paying something in the region of $1 

billion a month for their logo-rich War on Terrorism. 

<p>



That doesn't count the cost of rounding up those who may have committed the 

crimes. Racial profiling is expensive, especially when local police forces 

won't do the work. We'll have to pay the feds to throw the dragnet. Then 

there are those military tribunals -- there may be some cost cutting on 

defense attorneys, juries and  appeals, but  "intelligence" never comes 

cheap, no matter how poor the return. Almost all we know about the CIA's 

secret "black budget" is that it never runs into the red. 

<p>



The President's War on Terrorism doesn't depend on private charity. Our 

pockets are picked to pay for that war. But how about the terror of hunger? 

We the people could do with a war on that. Call it the people's war against 

poverty. In that war, we'd have the money we need to combat hunger and 

homelessness. Let the Pentagon hold a bake sale.
