Like many other news items that have ballooned to huge national 

proportions in recent years, the story that made Gary Condit infamous has 

been largely propelled by cable television. It's the media scandal of the 

season. Eager to rev up their ratings, the networks are in salacious overdrive.



<p>Reporters, pundits, forensic experts, police officers -- and of 

course, plenty of lawyers -- are all over the tube, spinning through every 

real or imagined detail about Rep. Condit's sexual relationship with 

government intern Chandra Levy.



<p>Summertime ... and the titillating is easy. It's time to dish!



<p>Early this month, when flight attendant Anne Marie Smith appeared 

in a Fox News interview to say she'd had an affair with Condit, she zoomed 

to instant celeb status. Since then, whether walking her dog or pulling 

luggage through an airport, she has become a familiar sight on television.



<p>At MSNBC -- eagerly providing wall-to-wall coverage of "The Search 

for Chandra" -- the network's executive producer, Ramon Escobar, claims to 

have no misgivings. "Columnists criticize cable for doing too much, but 

this is a story with a lot of stuff going on," he said the other day. "I'd 

rather err on the side of too much. You've got to dive into it."



<p>No matter how shallow the pool.



<p>The heaviest coverage on broadcast television has come from "NBC 

Nightly News," which aired 10 stories about Condit and Levy during a single 

week. In contrast, "CBS Evening News" was conspicuous for staying away from 

the story, though CBS devoted major attention to the subject on other 

programs -- including "Face the Nation," where correspondent Bob Schieffer 

broke new journalistic ground by asking whether Levy might have been 

pregnant when she disappeared.



<p>In a somewhat defensive appearance on the PBS "NewsHour With Jim 

Lehrer," CNN's Wolf Blitzer did his best to justify the onslaught of 

Condit-Levy programming on cable. "I don't see how we can ignore it," 

Blitzer said. That was, of course, a straw argument -- as if the only 

choice has been whether to "ignore" the story or turn it into the current 

media mega-mania.



<p>A visitor from another planet, sequestered in a hotel room with a 

cable hookup anywhere in America, might plausibly assume that Levy's fate 

and Condit's actions are of grave national import. With so many hours 

devoted to the story on each cable news channel, the stakes would seem to 

be momentous. Yet -- aside from the media space it takes up -- the story 

has approximately zero importance for public policy and the future of our 

society.



<p>Predictably, media commentators on the political right have tended 

to be most rabid in their denunciations of Condit. After all, he's a 

Democrat. But ironically, Condit is far from liberal. As a founding leader 

of the party's Blue Dog faction, he has worked hard to move his colleagues 

rightward.



<p>"Condit's conservative Blue Dog Coalition has gained stature in 

the Republican-controlled House," the home district Fresno Bee reported in 

January 2000. Days later, the newspaper explained: "With the GOP holding a 

slight majority, the votes of conservative Democrats such as Condit are 

highly sought."



<p>George W. Bush offered his embrace. "When Condit cast one of the 

few Democratic votes for President Bush's budget and tax cut package," 

according to the San Jose Mercury News, "he was rewarded with a seat at 

Bush's table during a celebration of the president's first 100 days in office."



<p>To hear some bombastic media pros tell it, the Condit scandal is a 

crucial litmus test for human morality in our nation. On the right-wing Fox 

News Channel, the network's star Bill O'Reilly has been in seventh heaven. 

"This is about honesty and cruelty," he proclaimed on his July 10 program. 

O'Reilly was full of compassion: "The suffering of a family, whose daughter 

may have been murdered, is extremely important."



<p>Minutes later, O'Reilly introduced Oliver North, the former Reagan 

administration operative who funneled weapons to the U.S.-backed Contra 

army while it killed thousands of civilians in the Nicaraguan countryside. 

Who better to discuss issues of "honesty and cruelty" and "the suffering of 

a family"? O'Reilly did not mention his guest's murderous past.



<p>North, who broke federal law with impunity while working in the 

White House, lost no time denouncing Condit. "He makes laws that affect all 

of us," North said. "You cannot have one set of personal morality for your 

private life and another set of morality for your public life."
