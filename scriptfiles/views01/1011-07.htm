<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->A small car stops to pick up a young lad in white shalwar kameez and white

cap who is hitching a ride.  The driver, a middle-aged professional, drives

daily from the western edge of town to his institute near the Presidency in

the centre of Islamabad.   "Where do you work?" asks the driver, after it is

established that the lad is going to be a passenger for the whole journey.



<p>'Oh, I only study," said the lad.  That makes the academic more inquisitive.



<p>Academic : "Where is your school?"



<p>Laddie:  "I am in a Madrassa in Golra, but am now going to get a loan from

someone so I can pay for my food and lodging at the Madrassa."



<p>A:  "How long does it take for you to study and get a job?"



<p>L:  "I will study for 10 years and thereafter spend 3 years learning the

Quran by heart.  Students who put their heart into the Holy book can do it

in 6 months.  After I get this done I can get a job in a mosque or a

seminary ."



<p>A;  "In addition to just studying religion, don't you feel like studying a

skill that could get you into a profession.   Let's say become an

electrician or a plumber."



<p>L:  "No, that's for people who want to live *here*!  I wish to die in the

Jehad, and now it is so nearby, so once I pay off my loan, and it won't take

more that 2 months, I will be off with the Lashkar (the fighter group) to

Aghanistan."



<p>The academic rather shaken by the reply, takes a breather to make sure he is

still headed in the right direction!



<p>But again:



<p>A:  "What does your dad do?"



<p>L:  "May his soul rest in peace, he died in the Jihad last year, as did my

eldest brother.  My mum now lives with my uncle in Swat?  I only have a

brother who works in Karachi and he supports me.  Since he has not sent me

money I have had to take a loan these last two months."



<p>A:  "How will you be able to fight, given that you have been studying at the

Madrassa?"



<p>L:  "We have all be trained by 'Hizbullah' in Kotli, a town in northern

Pakistan, for three months.  We were shown how to use firearms and other

master some military maneuvers.  There are Lashkars leaving all the time  --

20,000 jehadis are going from my area and we expect 50,000 to join from

Punjab -- and I can join any of these parties or smaller groups.  We can

cross over into Afghanistan easily as the border is 2000 miles long and

cannot be guarded by the Pakistan military."  He continues after a pause,

"The real tragedy is that our leadership is afraid of the American, but this

military man (Musharraf) will die disgraced, more so that Nawaz Sharif.

Zia-ul-Haq [the general whose rule led to the rise of militancy in the

Madrassas during the anti-Soviet struggle of the 1980s ] was martyred as he

was killed by the Americans.  We will win as we are on the right and no

enemy of Islam can defeat us."



<p>A:  "What is your age?" trying to change the subject.



<p>L:  "I am 19, and ready to go to the next world."



<p>The car has reached the parking lot where the academic works.  After the

"thank you, and God bless you," the lad leaves.



<p>Slightly shaken, the academic enters the Institute, the entrance area filled

with smartly dressed boys in jeans and girls in colorful dresses.  The

notices inside are all in English and there's a new one today from Western

Michigan University.  It informs the Institute's students that the American

Embassy will still be open to offer them a visa to go for future studies in

Kalamazoo.



<p>I am the academic and this happened today - October 9, 2001
