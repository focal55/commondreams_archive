You ask me if I think the American press is "too free." "Too free for your country 

and culture?" "Too free for your taste?" "Too free for its own good?" you say.

<p>You want to know if I wish my country's press had its freedom protected the 

way it is here. </p>

<p>Well, in theory it has. Freedom of expression is stated in the Constitution 

of Ecuador. The state guarantees free access to public information and the right 

to write or speak without censorship. </p>

<p>Does that mean that the press is free? Let's see. Last January during the last 

Indian revolt, four people were shot and killed in confrontations with the military. 

Several broadcast stations faced pressure to quash the story; a few smaller ones 

did. In various towns, reporters received threatening phone calls and a group 

of soldiers even "visited" one of the public radio stations for several hours. 

</p>

<p>Last September, the security guards of a governmental office in Quito, the 

capital city, detained a press photographer, forcing him to develop his film after 

he photographed a protest held by a group of ecologists. In my country, as in 

almost every country on the American continent, what is written in the law (and 

the way it is written) creates conflicts between a citizen's right of privacy 

and the people's right to be informed. The same law that, in theory, protects 

free speech has obstacles. A short phrase in the Constitution regarding "objective, 

truthful, plural and opportune information" gives the government a tool to try 

to press the independent media to censor material, especially in time of war or 

internal revolts. </p>

<p>Preserving "the values of the community" is a constitutional limit. And according 

to the Constitution, Ecuadorian journalists have the right to express and give 

their opinion through any mass media "without damage to the responsibilities anticipated 

in the law." (Which means that, in case of a suit, they will be treated as any 

other person and eventually end up in jail.) </p>

<p>An open law creates a stronger press. In contrast, tricks and vacuums are usually 

reflected in obstacles to the journalist's job, especially when it has to do with 

investigative reports. </p>

<p>The pressure can have many faces. Here are just two from my own experience: 

A government official can refuse to talk with a journalist if he doesn't like 

her. A government office can withhold information even if it's in public files. 

So even if freedom of expression is in the Ecuadorian Constitution, that doesn't 

mean that the press in my country is completely free. </p>

<p>Freedom of expression is also in the U.S. Constitution. Does that mean that 

the press of this country is free? </p>

<p>Let's see. A few days after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11 in New York and 

Washington, White House spokesman Ari Fleischer asked journalists to "watch what 

they say and watch what they do," after the host of a late-night talk show said 

the plane hijackers were not cowards but warriors. </p>

<p>In the past three months, at least three columnists were fired because of their 

dissenting opinions and President Bush warned this country that many things about 

this war will never be known. The president's national security adviser Condoleezza 

Rice urged networks to "exercise judgment" and not air taped broadcasts by Osama 

bin Laden spokesmen in their entirety, and some networks agreed. </p>

<p>Five months ago, I came to this country eager to learn what it is like to work 

with a guaranteed protection of the freedom to speak, to ask and to write. Because 

of so many examples of excellent investigative journalism in this country, I was 

sure this was the right place. My fellowship in the Seattle Post-Intelligencer 

came at a tough time for the U.S. press -- it is caught between the need to inform 

the public, a national wave of patriotism and the secrets of this "new" type of 

war. During this time, I received mixed messages. </p>

<p>I feel almost daily delight listening to the remarkable job of the journalists 

on public radio who keep an unbiased line in each report. I enjoy the articles 

in newspapers across the country that make open debate stronger. I learn about 

good journalism in all the reports that approach "the enemy" in all its complexities 

-- beyond the simple concept of the "evil doer." </p>

<p>But I also see journalists not making enough effort to separate the government's 

interests from the need of the public to be informed. I have watched flags, logos 

and patriotic songs framing TV reports. I listen to journalists talking about 

"us" when referring to this country in war. </p>

<p>Tom Gutting, former columnist for the Texas City Sun who was fired after he 

criticized Bush's leadership, wrote after the incident, "America is under a microscope 

more than ever and that means it is more important than ever to adhere to our 

ideals." I guess he is right. I guess this country is under a microscope and its 

press is too. </p>

<p>And that is why I think the question now is not if the United States is "too 

free," but if it is free enough to keep its well-deserved reputation of independence 

and excellence.</p>
