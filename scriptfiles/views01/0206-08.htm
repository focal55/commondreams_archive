Recently, we have become friends with Matt Hahn, a young medical doctor

who lives in the eastern panhandle of West Virginia.



<p>Dr. Hahn is a conventional doctor in many ways -- his clinic is littered

with little notepads supplied by drug companies, and he treats patients

with conventional medicines.



<p>But Dr. Hahn's practice is unconventional in many others.



<p>He is a firm believer in preventive medicine. He realizes that much of the

population is overweight and out of shape because of poor diet, too much

drinking, smoking and abuse of drugs, and not enough exercise.



<p>He does house calls -- for those of you too young to remember, that's

where, if the patient can't go and see the doctor, the doctor goes and

sees the patient at the patient's house.



<p>And he's not hostile to alternative medicine.



<p>In the spring, he wants to start a "walk with the doctor" program, where

he'll take his patients out for a walk on the C&O Canal, which borders his

clinic.



<p>He has crafted a common sense six-point preventive health plan that, if

implemented, would shut down much of our junk economy.



<p>Our society -- from television, to the schools, to public libraries, to

the internet -- has been so overrun by commercial values that sometimes we

feel the only way to protect children from the commercialism that entices

them to eat junk food and abuse their bodies with drugs is to rip-out the

corporate I.V. tube.



<p>In its place, we would plug in Dr. Hahn's I.V. tube, through which he

would deliver these six important points:



<p>1) Eat a healthy diet -- eat more fruits and vegetables, but eat less food

overall.



<p>2) Exercise every day.



<p>3) Say no to tobacco, drugs and excessive alcohol.



<p>4) Be safe -- wear seatbelts and helmets. Don't drink and drive. Practice

safe sex. (We've heard Dr. Hahn give his graphic talk on sexually

transmitted diseases. Believe us, he doesn't -- and doesn't have to -- use

the word "abstain.") Steer clear of weapons and violence.



<p>5) Keep immunizations up to date.



<p>6) Respect yourself and each other.



<p>We're not saying Dr. Hahn's six points are the be and end all of public

health. Some in our community want to add -- turn off the television and

computers. Others say that we've gone overboard on immunizations. Some

want urge a crack down on polluters. Even Dr. Hahn is considering a point

seven -- get enough sleep.



<p>But it's time we turned to our neighbors and friends, and professionals

like Dr. Hahn, whom we instinctively trust more than we trust the

television and cable networks. We like the idea that Dr. Hahn is taking

his preventive health program into the public school system. Our children

need to hear the truth about prevention.



<p>It is absolutely clear that from junk food, to tobacco, alcohol and drugs,

to sedentary lifestyles, children are getting the wrong message. And the

states are bearing the burden of cleaning up the mess.



<p>Last week, we were at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C. and ran

into Joseph Califano, the former Secretary of Health and Human Services

under President Carter.   Califano is now the president of the National

Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University in New York

City.



<p>Califano was in Washington, D.C. to release the findings of a three-year

study revealing that the states are spending a full 13 percent of their

budgets ($81.3 billion of the total $620 billion in state spending) on

cleaning up the aftermath of alcohol, tobacco and drug abuse. Even taking

into account how the self-inflicted costs of the drug war inflate the

figure, the total is staggering -- and it doesn't even include local or

federal expenditures.



<p>"Substance abuse and addiction is the elephant in the living room of state

government, creating havoc with service systems, causing illness, injury

and death and consuming increasing amounts of state resources," Califano

said.



<p>Califano called the policy of "shoveling up" the wreckage of abuse

"insane," and called on the states to instead implement a policy of

prevention and treatment.



<p>And of course, it's not just alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs.



<p>Americans are way overweight. The Centers for Disease Control reported

last month that diabetes in the United States rose about six percent in

1999. The CDC blamed the increase in diabetes largely on obesity, which is

up an astounding 57 percent from 1991.



<p>According to the CDC, the share of the adult population diagnosed with

diabetes rose from 6.5 percent in 1998 to 6.9 percent in 1999. The obesity

rate rose from 12 percent in 1991 to about 20 percent in 1999.



<p>Americans have been lulled into a sedentary and abusive lifestyle --

watching television, eating junk food, drinking sugared water drinks,

abusing tobacco and alcohol. Today, for example, the average American

consumes 600 12-ounce cans of soda a year. Each can contains an average of

10 teaspoons of sugar.



<p>We have met the enemy -- and it is these giant corporations that have

poisoned our collective well. It's time we band together, unplug from the

corporate system, and plug in a comprehensive preventative health program.
