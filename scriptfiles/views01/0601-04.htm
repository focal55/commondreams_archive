The Bush administration has come up with the sort of energy policy

one would expect of oilmen -- long on breaks for the energy industry

and short on promotion of conservation, alternative energy sources

and help for working people.

<P>Congressional Democrats were closer to the mark with their own

energy plan. They called for the government to hold down price

increases for electric power, offer tax credits for energy-efficient

homes, cars and businesses and spare environmentally sensitive areas

from oil and gas exploration.</P>

<P>The Democrats also called for the Federal Energy Regulatory

Commission to stop producers from charging "unjust and unreasonable

wholesale prices.'' FERC would return to "cost-of-service-based

rates'' until March 2003, which would limit wholesalers' profits. The

D's also want FERC to order refunds of any unjust charges that have

occurred already and are pressing the Justice Department to "assure

that illegal price-fixing does not occur.''</P>

<P>Vice President Dick Cheney has ruled out price limits and federal

investigations into allegations of price gouging by gasoline

companies. The former Halliburton CEO, who headed up the secretive

energy task force, belittled the role of conservation, which he said

"may be a sign of personal virtue, but it is not a sufficient basis

for a sound, comprehensive energy policy." Instead, he said, the

nation should encourage oil exploration and build a new power plant

every week for the next 20 years.</P>

<P>But utilities around the country say they have achieved remarkable

successes by encouraging conservation. Timothy Egan of the <I>New

York Times</I> wrote May 10 that city-run utilities in Sacramento and

Los Angeles have avoided the rolling blackouts of the past few months

by opting out of California's deregulation experiment and promoting

conservation. "Over the last ten years, we have conserved enough

energy to save us the equivalent of having to build one huge new

power plant," Mike Weedall, a manager at the Sacramento Municipal

Utility District, told Egan. "Instead, we like to say we built the

conservation power plant."</P>

<P>Egan also found officials at big private utilities who said

choosing conservation over big new power plants has paid off for

them. Potomac Electric Power Co., which serves 600,000 customers in

Maryland and the District of Columbia, has invested $360 million on

conservation in the last 10 years and eliminated the need for at

least two medium-sized power plants.</P>

<P>But Bush and Cheney have used the California deregulation debacle

to promote energy policies that would benefit their allies in the

fossil fuel and nuclear industries. The plan depends upon raising

fears of an energy crisis. For example, the White House predicted

severe power troubles ahead for New England, and New Hampshire in

particular, but when Tom Oliphant of the <I>Boston Globe</I> looked

into it, the director of New Hampshire's energy office said the state

has plenty of supply and electricity prices are falling. An official

at New England's Independent System Operator likewise said the region

has a "reserve energy margin" of nearly 19% more than it needs.</P>

<P>Cheney's doomsday scenario apparently relied on a report by the

North American Reliability Council, an umbrella group of the

country's electric utilities. It failed to include at least 1,500

megawatts routinely available to New England under an agreement with

a hydropower operation in Quebec.</P>

<P>"This is what happens when a secretive White House drafts a

supply-fixated 'policy' from the bedrooms of the energy industry,"

Oliphant noted.</P>

<P>But private utilities in other parts of the country are picking up

on the theme of "energy crisis." Alliant Energy of Cedar Rapids,

Iowa, chose mid-May to close down three of its power plants for

"repairs," cutting power to schools and large industrial customers in

eastern Iowa as a taste of what could come if the Legislature fails

to pass a bill favorable to private utilities. Coincidentally, the

Legislature is preparing for a special session. In a crude corporate

blackmail, Alliant threatened not to build another generating plant

it has on the drawing boards unless the state grants it the breaks it

demands, including deregulation of rates it passes through from

wholesale generators (which would allow the same sorts of abuses of

the ratepayers that are occurring in California).</P>

<P>The federal government, through FERC, should re-regulate wholesale

generating companies. The debacle in California illustrates the error

in trusting an unregulated market to cure utility excesses.

California deregulated the wholesalers but not the retailers, so the

energy holding companies transferred their assets to their wholesale

operations and gouged the retailers, leaving the tax- and rate-payers

to foot the bill. Energy corporations have made it clear that if they

see an advantage they will take it. The government should not let

them.</P>

<P>If private utilities are unwilling or unable to build new power

plants or operate their old ones, states or the federal government

should take them over. Public power, from the Tennessee Valley

Authority to the Bonneville Power Administration, is one of the

proudest legacies of the New Deal. Municipal or state-owned utilities

typically are able to operate at less cost to the consumer than

investor-owned utilities, if for no other reason than they are not

required to show a profit. San Francisco will vote this November on

whether to create a municipal utility district, and labor and

consumer groups are promoting the establishment of a California

Public Power Authority to provide adequate electric generating

capacity. If necessary, they should use the power of eminent domain

to take control of generating plants previously owned by the

utilities to force power generators to lower their prices.</P>

<P>The government should not only promote alternative energy sources,

such as wind, solar and renewable fuels, but also adopt regulations

that mesh these systems with regional power grids. Wind turbines near

our office in Storm Lake, Iowa, can generate more than 193 megawatts

-- an amount that could light up every home in Des Moines. Expansion

of the "wind farms" is limited only by the number of transmission

lines to the power grid, but at a cost of approximately 3 cents per

kilowatt hour -- and lower in some areas -- wind turbines are cheaper

to operate than gas, coal or nuclear plants, according to Ken Hach of

Clipper Wind Power, which operates 259 turbines in northwest Iowa.

Windmills now supply about 1% of the national electrical supply, he

said. With a little help that capacity could increase to 10%.</P>

<P>There is ample reason to doubt that there is even an energy

crisis. David Whitman of <I>US News &amp; World Report</I> wrote May

15 that the power plant industry already is in the midst of an

unprecedented building boom, and is adding more than the plant a week

Cheney called for. Last year, 158 new power units were completed

nationwide, or three plants a week, according to the federal Energy

Information Administration. The electricity industry already expects

to build 1,453 new power units from 2000 through 2004.</P>

<P>Cheney's energy plan did include tax credits to help people buy

hybrid gas-electric cars that get substantially better gas mileage

than regular cars, but the only versions currently available are

Japanese-made Toyotas and Hondas. American automakers aren't expected

to debut their hybrid vehicles until 2003, and even then it's unclear

whether they will be widely available. Meanwhile, the Bush

administration is canceling a 2004 deadline for automakers to develop

prototype cars that would get up to 80 miles per gallon. The federal

government spent $1.4 billion on the research, in what some called

"corporate welfare," but now that the technology is on the verge of

being reached, the plans for a "supercar" are being set aside.</P>

<P>More oil and gas production is not going to solve our energy

problems, particularly when refineries already are operating at

capacity. The increase in the price of gas is attributable to the

demand for gas-guzzling cars, particularly sport-utility vehicles.

Oil companies and carmakers have worked hand-in-glove for years to

sideline fuel-efficiency standards. The carrot has not worked so far;

it's time for Feds to use the stick.
