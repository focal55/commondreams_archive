Does slavery still exist in Africa? That question was rudely inserted into

the national conversation last month when a ship from the West African nation

of Benin reportedly was lost while ferrying child slaves. Although that story

turned out to be overblown, it helped pull the cover off one of Africa's

dirtiest secrets: slavery persists.

<P>

   According to UNICEF estimates, there are 200,000 child slaves in West and

Central Africa. Most of those forced into involuntary servitude are in

economic bondage, with the boys being sold to cotton and cocoa plantations and

the girls ending up as domestic workers and vulnerable to sexual exploitation.

<P>



   But this kind of slavery largely is a product of poverty, experts say, and

is not limited to Africa. In South Asia, for example, parents often pledge the

labor of their children as payment or collateral on a debt. This is called

bonded labor and Human Rights Watch estimates there are 15 million children

involved in India alone.

<P>

   The slave ship incident may have awakened the U.S. public to the

persistence of such inhumane practices, but the discussion about slavery in

Africa has been raging just beneath the surface of public discourse for at

least a decade. That conversation has focused primarily on the African nations

of Mauritania and Sudan, where slavery is less a function of poverty than of

tradition and war. What's more, since both countries are "Islamic republics,"

dominated by Arab rulers, the issue has been aggravated by religious

antagonisms, race and cultural rivalries. Further controversy has centered on

the lack of protest from the African-American community, especially since

condemnation of the transatlantic slave trade is so pivotal to black

leadership's critique of the West.

<P>

   In Mauritania, the country's leadership is dominated by ethnic Berbers who

are racially distinct from the indigenous black population. In Sudan, however,

the difference is mostly cultural or vaguely "ethnic."

<P>

   In September, a Mauritanian national born into slavery provided a harrowing

account of his life in testimony before a hearing of the Senate's Foreign

Relations Committee. Moctar Teyeb explained that Mauritania's tradition of

slavery goes back to the 12th Century when Arab-Berbers invaded the region and

created a slave caste. "We became haratines--black Muslim slaves who

faithfully served our white Arab masters, the beyadannes. Slaves exist to

serve the master's every need," Teyeb told the committee. Slaves also are

given as wedding gifts and traded for camels, guns or other coveted items, he

said.

<P>

   Teyeb, who is the outreach director of the American Anti-Slavery Group (the

leading group in the anti-slavery movement), said he is a Muslim and does not

blame his religion for the practice. "The values and concepts that drive the

Mauritanian system of slavery are backed by a wrong version of Islam," he

said.

<P>

   There is a similar tradition in Sudan, but it has been aggravated by an

18-year civil war that pits the Arab-dominated north against the

traditionalist and Christian south. The UN Commission on Human Rights, Human

Rights Watch and the U.S. State Department all have published reports

confirming charges that slavery is practiced in the country. According to the

reports, armed militia supported by the Islamic government regularly conduct

raids of Christian and traditionalist enclaves in the county's southern region

and force captives into servitude.

<P>

   Because the raids seemingly have a sectarian character, the practice has

energized Christian groups in opposition. One group, Christian Solidarity

International, actually collects money to purchase freedom for the captives.

The Zurich-based group claims to have "redeemed" more than 10,000 captives

since 1995.

<P>

   But many argue that the group's campaign is misguided. Civil war, not

slavery, is the real enemy in Sudan, they argue, and offering money to buy

captives serves to encourage rather than discourage the practice. Moreover,

Human Rights Watch has reported that the rival Sudan Peoples Liberation Army

also is engaged in the practice of child abduction and forced servitude.

<P>

   But increased publicity about the existence of slavery in Africa at last

has provoked the African-American community to begin addressing the issue.

Black leaders have been reluctant to wade into the controversy for many

reasons: African-Americans tend to think of slavery solely as the

transatlantic trade; there are moral ambiguities involved in criticizing

independent African countries that also are the victims of propaganda seeking

solely to discredit them; the pervasive influence of Islam on the black

freedom movement and the reluctance to condemn fellow Muslims. But those

barriers are falling and many more black groups are joining the ranks of the

new abolitionists. It's about time.
