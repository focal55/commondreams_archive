It&#039;s good to know that even in the midst of waging war on terrorism, George Bush is able to consider the nation&#039;s women.

<P>Unfortunately he&#039;s considering shrinking - if not eliminating - some of the federal agencies that are charged with protecting women&#039;s interests, according to a recent story in the New York Times.

<P>Those under fire include the 10 regional offices of the Labor Department&#039;s Women&#039;s Bureau. The bureau was created in the 1920s after women obtained the right to vote.

<P>Meanwhile, the panels that advise the military and the Department of Veterans Affairs on women&#039;s issues - like mammograms and sexual trauma - have been stalled because the White House has not named new members. Nor has the administration named new members to the Defense Advisory Committee on Women in the Services.

<P>In addition, there is some talk in Washington about consolidating offices on women&#039;s health in agencies like the Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

<P>Five advocacy groups have protested to Labor Secretary Elaine Chao, saying, &#034;The elimination of the Women&#039;s Bureau regional offices, like the elimination of the department&#039;s equal pay initiative, would end programs that are vital ... to working women today.&#034;

<P>None of this should come as a surprise, however, to women&#039;s advocacy groups or American women in general. After all, this is the president who reinstated the &#034;global gag rule&#034; - which cut off U.S. international aid money from going to any family planning organization that provides abortions or even considers the topic - on his very first day in office. And it&#039;s the same president who decided not to continue the White House Office on Women&#039;s Initiatives and Outreach, created by Clinton in 1995.

<P>And it&#039;s the same president whose wife recently went on radio to declare that &#034;the fight against terrorism is also a fight for the rights and dignity of women.&#034;

<P>Judging by  Bush&#039;s most recent actions, we have to wonder what women Bush is fighting for. It&#039;s certainly not American women, and judging by the administration&#039;s low-key efforts to involve women in any post-Taliban government, it&#039;s not Afghan women, either.
