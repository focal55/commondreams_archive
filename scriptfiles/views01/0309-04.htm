More than 50 years ago, governments committed themselves by international treaty to take the necessary steps to realize everyone's human right to ``the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health.''

<P></P>

But judging from their actions, political leaders of the richest industrialized countries are more concerned with globalizing so-called ``free'' markets than with global responses to the world's HIV/AIDS pandemic. Pursuit of this corporate agenda is contributing to the deaths of millions.

<P></P>

For the 95 per cent of people with HIV/AIDS who live in developing countries, the high price of medicines means little or no hope for treatment. Few can afford basic drugs for treatable infections that overpower weakened immune systems. And fewer still can afford anti-retroviral drugs that fight HIV to slow or prevent the progression of the disease — drugs that have dramatically reduced mortality rates in richer countries.

<P></P>

As noted in a recent letter in the medical journal <i>Lancet</i>, ``The question of AIDS treatment leads to a wider reflection on the balance between public and private interests, between patent rights and the rights of patients.''

<P></P>

So far, that balance has been tilted dramatically in favour of the interests of private profit. So-called ``free trade'' agreements aim primarily to ensure corporate freedom to maximize profit, without hindrance by government policies aimed at protecting such public goods as health.

<P></P>

The Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property (TRIPS), administered by the World Trade Organization, does not free up trade in pharmaceutical products. Rather, it imposes restrictive, U.S.-style patent laws on WTO member countries in order to protect the pharmaceutical companies' market monopolies for a minimum of 20 years. 

<P></P>

These monopolies sustain prices that far exceed the average income of most of the world's people dying from AIDS. But industry is not primarily interested in markets in developing countries. Rather, it is their market monopolies in richer countries, which can pay prices considerably higher than those necessary to generate a reasonable profit, that make the brand-name pharmaceutical industry the most profitable in the world.

<P></P>

Nevertheless, even though poor countries account for but a small percentage of the world pharmaceutical market, the industry has opposed their efforts to circumvent patent rights in situations of national emergency — efforts that are perfectly legal under international agreements. South Africa, for example, faces a lawsuit from the industry lobby group, for contemplating "compulsory licences" allowing another manufacturer to produce a patented drug with a reasonable royalty paid to the patent-holder. Note that the patent-holder still makes a profit, just not as high as monopoly pricing would allow.

<P></P>

The U.S. has recently filed a complaint at the WTO against Brazil over its "local working" laws that make a patent-holder's enjoyment of full patent protection in that country conditional upon the company manufacturing the drug there.

<P></P>

Apologists for the pharmaceutical industry argue that stronger patent protections are necessary to generate a return on expensive investments in researching and developing new drugs. Nobody disputes that some return is necessary as an incentive for private companies to engage in further research. But this is no defence, for several reasons.

<P></P>

First, companies refuse to disclose research and development expenditures on a drug-by-drug basis, so their claims about the costs of developing new drugs are not subject to independent verification. Second, many new drugs are developed with considerable investment of public research funds. Third, a portion of the costs claimed by industry often relates to advertising their products to consumers and physicians. Fourth, pharmaceutical companies already make huge profits. Medecins Sans Frontieres has reported that Glaxo Wellcome made $589 million (U.S.) on one AIDS drug in 1999 alone, recouping more than twice its research and development costs in just this one year.

<P></P>

The argument that even greater patent protection is needed to ensure a return on companies' investment amounts to mere greed. At some point, the pursuit of profit must give way to the greater public good. 

<P></P>

Reasonable profits should be permitted, but companies are flush with profits from monopoly pricing, while millions die because they cannot afford to purchase their lives. Apologists for industry will also divert attention from high drug prices by asking, "What about poor health infrastructure in most developing countries?"

<P></P>

There is no doubt that many developing countries lack decent health-care infrastructure in the form of facilities, delivery mechanisms, and fully trained health-care personnel. There is an urgent need to address this gap, in tandem with increased affordability of medicines. But this cannot be used as the excuse to deny access — through exorbitant pricing — to all those who live in countries with poor infrastructure.

<P></P>

First, some basic medicines are easy to deliver and use even in a less developed health-care system. Second, even an imperfect infrastructure is capable of supporting the delivery and use of medicines by at least some people — if they could afford it. Finally, even a perfectly developed infrastructure is of little benefit if the drugs are simply priced out of reach.

<P></P>

As a matter of basic human decency, we must demand that pharmaceutical companies rise above a single-minded pursuit of profit at the expense of the lives of millions. And we must demand leadership of our governments in reining in profiteering and abuse of patent rights. True leadership does not mean pursuing the "free market" ideology at all costs.

<P></P>

It means honouring the commitment made a half-century ago to ensuring the human right to health, placing public health considerations front and centre in international trade policy and domestic patent laws. In the face of monstrous, avoidable suffering, leaving global AIDS policy to the market is morally bankrupt.
