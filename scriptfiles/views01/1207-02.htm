<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->Yesterday the U.S. House of Representatives barely approved fast track trade

authority by a vote of 215 to 214, ending a long battle that pitted the Fortune

500 against a broad alliance of labor, environmental, religious, feminist,

human rights, consumer, family farm and other activists.



<p>These diverse forces defeated fast track twice during the Clinton

Administration and managed to delay a vote numerous times this year because of

lack of support.  Now that fast track has been approved, pro-free trade

analysts would no doubt like to begin ringing the death knell of the opposition

forces.  To the contrary, there are several reasons why this vote is only a

small setback in the fight against corporate globalization.



<p><b>1.  Free Traders Undermined Their Legitimacy With Cheap Sell Tactics</b>

<p>The K Street lobbyists, Capitol Hill horse traders, and White House

spin-meisters had to really hustle to pull this one out.  We will never know

how many millions of dollars in campaign contributions or pork deals were

needed to eke out a win.  When money wouldn't work, the Administration diverted

Colin Powell from the war effort to try to persuade members of Congress with

the ludicrous argument that fast track was needed to fight terrorism.  (Now

that Bush has  fast track, can we expect Osama bin Laden to emerge from his

cave waving a white flag?) All this last-minute manipulation makes it

impossible for free traders to claim that fast track passed on merit.



<p><b>2.  Just As NAFTA Pork Created An Anti-Free Trade Groundswell, So Too Will This Vote Doom Future Deals</b>

<p>In 1993, NAFTA backers faced defeat in the House of Representatives even a week

before the vote.  Then, Clinton started buying support with promises of

military contracts, research centers, and protections for various commodities. 

Although it succeeded in pushing the deal through, the strategy proved

short-sighted.  The tainted nature of that vote, along with NAFTA's dismal

record, paved the way for the defeat of fast track in 1997 and 1998 and for the

recent wave of mass demonstrations against globalization that first erupted in

Seattle in 1999.  This time around, we're likely to see similar fallout.  Even

free traders such as Norman Ornstein of the American Enterprise Institute

warned in the days leading up to the vote that the last- minute arm-twisting

could create such harsh feelings that Congress might reject future trade deals.



<p><b>3.  Planned Trade Deals Face Many Other Obstacles</b>

<p>What the House passed today was merely a procedural matter.  Free traders still

face high hurdles to obtain actual new deals.  The two most significant on the

horizon are:



<p>FREE TRADE AREA OF THE AMERICAS:  The idea to expand NAFTA to 31 other nations

has few champions in the hemisphere.  The populist government of Venezuela

refused to agree to the timetable for negotiations worked out in April in

Quebec City, Canada.  The Brazilian government fears that it will lose its

clout in South America by entering a hemispheric deal where it would be

overshadowed by the United States.  For Mexico, the FTAA would mean losing the

privileged access to the U.S. market it now enjoys under NAFTA.  Argentina is

in economic meltdown and facing a growing backlash against free market polices.

 Small economies of the Caribbean fear that the loss of tariff revenues would

cripple their public sectors.  Meanwhile, a Hemispheric Social Alliance has

formed that joins 50 million trade unionists and citizens networks across the

Americas in opposition to the FTAA.



<p>WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION:  The Doha ministerial in early November managed to

produce an agreement to launch a new round of negotiations, but the meeting

hardly left the impression of rousing consensus. France (one of the biggest

global agricultural exporters) and India (the world's biggest democracy) were

both threatening to pull out at the 11th hour.  Negotiators had to work past

the deadline and through the night just to save face with an agreement that was

so vague that countries on opposing sides of key issues could all claim

victory. These divisions are likely to flare up once again once the real deal-

making begins-and next time negotiators may not be thousands of miles away from

the nearest protestor.



<p><b>4.  This Is One Setback Among Many Victories</b>

<p>The growing movement to oppose corporate globalization is unprecedented in the

breadth of its composition and its demands and in its many cross-border

linkages.  While U.S. activists have suffered a blow on fast track, there have

been-and will continue to be-victories on many other fronts:



<p>WTO:  At the recent WTO meeting, governments agreed to give poor countries

better access to discounts on drugs for AIDS and other major killers. 

Previously, U.S. AIDS activists had pressured pharmaceutical firms and the U.S.

government to back off challenges to South Africa's and Brazil's programs to

offer affordable AIDS treatment.  The U.S. government had alleged that these

programs violated WTO rules on intellectual property rights.



<p>INTERNATIONAL BANKRUPTCY MECHANISM:  Last week the IMF made the surprise

announcement that it now supports an idea promoted for years by progressives to

create an international bankruptcy mechanism for developing countries facing

debt crises.  While the details remain to be seen, the idea is to establish a

procedure based on Chapter 11 of U.S. bankruptcy law that would protect

governments from being sued by creditors during negotiations over debt

restructuring.  Progressives have long argued that such a mechanism was needed

to ensure that private investors are not bailed out while the poor bear the

burden of economic crises.



<p>MAI:  in 1998, international activists, particularly in Canada and France,

spearheaded the defeat of the Multilateral Agreement on Investment.  Negotiated

in the rich country club, the Organization of Economic Cooperation and

Development in Paris, the MAI would have severely restricted the authority of

governments to control the activity of foreign investors.



<p>DEBT:  since the late 1990s, several rich country governments have responded to

pressure from religious and other activists by canceling debts owed to them by

poor countries.  (The IMF and World Bank also responded with a debt relief

program, but this is only a partial victory since the institutions are

demanding that debt relief be conditioned on onerous conditions and many

impoverished countries, such as Haiti, are left out.)



<p>CORPORATE CAMPAIGNS:  a number of groups have been successful in pressuring

specific companies to modify their behavior (e.g. Rainforest Action Network's

concessions from Home Depot to support sustainable forestry, certain companies

pulling out of Burma over egregious human rights abuses).  In addition,

students have organized on dozens of campuses to pressure their administrations

to adopt a code of conduct against purchasing college gear that has been made

in sweatshops.



<p>WORLD BANK/IMF:  since the late 1990s, there have been victories in individual

countries against policies promoted by the World Bank and IMF.  Workers,

peasants and others have been successful in fighting water privatization in

Bolivia, gasoline price hikes in Nigeria, labor law reforms in Korea, and

telecommunications privatization in Costa Rica.  In the United States, Congress

passed legislation in 2000 requiring U.S. representatives to the World Bank and

IMF to oppose projects that include "user fees" on access to primary health

care and education.  These fees have been associated with lower school

enrollment and reduced access to health care.



<p>GLOBAL FINANCIAL CASINO:  promoters of a tax on speculative capital flows

(known as a "Tobin Tax") have succeeded in obtaining support from some European

nations and Canada.  In September 2001, the European Commission agreed to study

the feasibility of such a tax.
