              City bomber Tim McVeigh&#146;s decision to ask the federal government 

              to help him commit suicide as a way out of a life sentence promises 

              to make 2001 the year of capital punishment in the United States. 

              And the rest of the world will be reminded once more of just how 

              backward, brutal and politically motivated this country&#146;s approach 

              to matters of crime and punishment remains.</font>

<P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">By 

              all accounts, McVeigh prefers lethal injection to a lifetime in 

              prison. Thus, in order to "punish" the man whose 1995 crime left 

              168 people dead, the feds plan to comply with his wish.</font></P>

<P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Absurd? 

              Absolutely. Even more absurd, and horrifying, is the fact that, 

              if McVeigh is executed, tax dollars from Wisconsin -- a state that 

              has banned capital punishment for 150 years -- will be used to kill 

              an imprisoned human being for the first time since 1963.</font></P>

<P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">While 

              U.S. Sen. Russ Feingold, D-Wis., and others -- including the families 

              of some Oklahoma City bombing victims -- have been courageously 

              seeking to prevent the renewal of federal executions, the bloodlust 

              of President George W. Bush and equally wrong-minded politicians 

              is such that they are unlikely to prevent the renewal of federally 

              funded murder.</font></P>

<P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 

              execution industry in this country requires a steady flow of blood 

              in order to keep the machinery of death in operation. Bush, Bill 

              Clinton and other "leaders" who have used capital punishment as 

              a political tool cannot allow common sense or sound criminal justice 

              policy to prevail -- since a halt to executions would prove the 

              point of capital punishment foes who argue that the economically 

              and emotionally costly gambit actually makes the streets less safe 

              by fostering a culture of violence.</font></P>

<P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If 

              most American politicians and jurists lack the courage and the intellectual 

              honesty to oppose capital punishment, leaders in other countries 

              are under no illusions about the fundamental flaws in a system of 

              state-sponsored executions. Last week, the Supreme Court of Canada 

              voted 9-0 to bar the extradition to the United States of two men 

              accused of murder in Washington state unless Canadian authorities 

              receive guarantees that the men will not face execution.</font></P>

<P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 

              jurists went far beyond the procedural blocking the extradition 

              of the two men, however. The high court of Canada -- a nation that 

              has barred capital punishment since 1976 -- condemned the death 

              penalty as the flawed, unjust and irrevocable travesty that it is. 

              Citing the frequency of reports of wrongful murder convictions in 

              the United States, the court said the public record "provides tragic 

              testimony to the fallibility of the legal system -- despite its 

              elaborate safeguards for the protection of the innocent."</font></P>

<P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Even 

              if safeguards did exist, however, the Canadian jurists argue that 

              the practice would be unacceptable. "It is final. It is irreversible. 

              Its imposition has been described as arbitrary," the judges said 

              of capital punishment. "Its deterrent value has been doubted. Its 

              implementation necessarily causes psychological and physical suffering."</font></P>

<P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 

              ruling by the Canadian court marks a dramatic shift in direction 

              by that country&#146;s judiciary. Until recently, Canadian courts 

              had held that even if their country&#146;s laws barred executions, 

              that did not constitute sufficient grounds for denying a request 

              for extradition to the United States.</font></P>

<P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">No 

              more. Citing the growing international consensus that capital punishment 

              is not merely unjust but, in fact, immoral, Canada&#146;s jurists 

              now say they can no longer cooperate with U.S. authorities who seek 

              to execute human beings. To do so, the justices explain, would "violate 

              our sense of fundamental justice."</font></P>

<P align="left">

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

Can 

              there be any doubt left that Americans -- be they judges, senators 

              or citizens -- ought to be saying the same thing?
