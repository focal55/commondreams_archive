I lay in bed in the mornings listening to a wind that

drowns the call to

prayer and whips at my windows, “wake up, wake up,

wake up.” But even awake

I can’t shake the nightmare. Corpses piled high in the

streets. This is

Baghdad at the end of 2001 - soon to be the city of

the Dead.





<p>I was in New York City on September 11th, and the one

source of hope I have

today is in how generous the people of New York were

after the terrible

attacks of that day. I take comfort in the feelings of

brotherhood and

sisterhood that I overwhelmingly felt in the aftermath

of that terror. And I

take comfort in the cries for peace that I heard and

saw as well. The

messages scrawled on sheet after sheet at the peace

shrine in Union Square

read, “We don’t want a war,” “Give peace a chance,”

and, “An eye for an eye

makes the whole world blind.”





<p>Of the hundreds of messages scrawled on those sheets,

I only remember one in

favor of war: “Retaliate x10.” And, God help me, I

find myself praying the

death toll will be that small.

It’s been almost 30 thirty years since the Vietnam

War, and we have yet to

come to grips with the fact that the Vietnamese people

paid for the 58,000

U.S. soldiers that were killed at a rate of 50:1. Our

country killed between

2 and 3 million people in Vietnam. Vietnam wasn’t a

war - it was a massacre.





<p>It’s been 11 years since “Desert Storm,” and we have

yet to come to grips

with the fact that for the roughly 150 U.S. soldiers

killed by enemy fire,

the Iraqi people paid at a rate of 1,000:1. Our

country killed between

100,000 and 200,000 people in Iraq during the 6 weeks

of “Desert Storm.” In

the long years since then, U.S.-led sanctions have

contributed to the deaths

of perhaps over 1,000,000 more innocents - most of

them children. That’s not

even a massacre - it’s a bloody slaughter.

When terrorists crash airplanes into crowded

skyscrapers, murdering massive

numbers of innocent people, we’d do well to ask

ourselves what taught them

to be so callous. And we’d do even better to stop

pretending it was the

“Playboy Channel.”





<p>My hotel is a block from Sadoun Street, one of

Baghdad’s busiest. Sanctions

have loosened some in the last year, but most people

still struggle in

desperate poverty. According to the UN, thousands

still die every month as a

result. Um Sultan’s three children are absolutely

beautiful, with big,

luminous eyes matched only by their infectious smiles.

They’re beggars.

9-year-old Oufan is leader, keeping track of her

younger sister, Eifan, age

7, and her brother Sultan, age 4. They’re out on

Sadoun every day, working

the street.





<p>I bought bananas for the street kids one day. They

grabbed them and ran just

far enough to make sure I wasn’t going to grab them

back. And then they ate

them, peel and all. That’s starving hungry. That’s in

a country where before

the sanctions the biggest complaint pediatricians had

was childhood obesity.





<p>Um Yasser won’t let her children beg for money, but

she let’s them hustle

for it. She has no choice. 12-year-old Yasser shines

shoes, and 9-year-old

Sara sells chewing gum. Between the two of them, they

make enough to support

themselves and their three, younger sisters. When I

asked Um Yasser where

their father was she shook her head sadly, and told me

he had died. Then she

raised her hand to the heavens and said in a strong,

clear voice, “Allah

Kareem” - God is Generous.





<p>I think of my cousin back in the United States, who

looked at me so

uncomprehendingly in the days before I left for Iraq.

I think of my cousin,

whom I love, who shrugged her shoulders and told me

with utter disdain,

“there will always be collateral damage.” I want to

grab her by the

shoulders, and shake her, and point to Oufan, Sara,

Yasser, Eifan and

Sultan, and all our other innocent victims, and ask

her which of their

deaths would restore her sense of security? There is

no such thing as

‘collateral damage,’ but the death of entire worlds.





<p>There’s an amusement park next to the Baghdad Zoo. It

reminds me of the

summer fairs in Manassas and Chantilly that I used to

look forward to all

winter long when I was younger. Carnie barkers calling

out their

attractions; the smell of roasting peanuts and

hotdogs; the ferris wheel,

bumper cars, fun house, and carousel. Evenings at

those summer fairs always

seemed to last forever.





<p>The carousel here in Baghdad is something straight out

of Ray Bradbury: wild

horses straining in mid-leap, frozen in hand-carved

and hand-painted wood;

children screaming in wild delight as they ride them,

or chase each other

between them. Their laughter should lift my heart. But

all I can see is what

their bodies will look like when the cluster bombs

start falling, and no

matter how far I ride the carousel I can’t ever seem

to find a way back to

the spirit of my innocence.





<p>The wind is blowing from the West this winter, and

something wicked this way

surely comes.
