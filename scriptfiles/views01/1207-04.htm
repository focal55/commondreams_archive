<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->The wages for millions of the lowest paid workers in the United States

are failing to meet their basic needs. Today workers can be employed

full-time and still have incomes below the national official poverty

line. This wage disparity is amplified for workers in high cost regions

who find themselves unable to afford rent, food, and basic necessities.

Reports from homeless shelter operators across the country indicate the

regular use of emergency housing by full-time employed individuals and

their families.



<p>This situation has been magnified by a quarter-century decline in real

family income for the bottom 40% of the workers in the U.S. The old

adage that the poor get poorer is increasingly true. Attempts to address

this issue have been widespread. Coalitions of progressive activists,

labor unions, and church leaders have formed loosely knit living wage

groups in many cities. The Living Wage Movement in the United States has

now successfully achieved the passage of minimum wage ordinances in some

70 cities. These ordinances have mostly required city contractors to pay

regionally determined wages that meet the basic needs of working

families.



<p>The Living Wage Movement often meets strong opposition. Resistance to

establishing local living wage ordinances or increasing the minimum wage

at State levels generally comes from business groups who claim that

increasing wages for the lowest paid workers will expand unemployment,

hurt small businesses, cause inflation, and encourage business

relocation.



<p>Research clearly shows that these concerns are misguided. When the

lowest paid workers receive additional income, they rapidly spend that

income to meet their basic needs. This new income circulating in the

region more then offsets the increased salary costs for most businesses

and will provide an overall fiscal boost to the local economy. Studies

show that in cities where living wages have been implemented that the

actual costs to business average less then 3% of revenue, and that

increased sales or small graduated price increases easily cover these

added wages. Furthermore there is no evidence indicating businesses shy

away from living wage areas. Actually, a thriving economy is more likely

to attract new businesses and encourage expansion, thereby increasing

employment in the community.



<p>When cities are considering the implementation of a living wage

ordinance, a cost benefit analysis is often conducted to determine

fiscal impacts. Generally missing from these reports are the long-term

regional fiscal impacts of increased spending by low-wage workers.



<p>New research conducted by myself and students from Sonoma State

University in Santa Rosa, California provides an understanding of the

positive effects of increased low-wage worker spending on local

economies. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics 1999 Santa Rosa PMSA

report indicates that approximately 5,391 City residences work in jobs

earning below $8.00 per hour. We conducted a random sample of these

low-wage workers using addresses from the Santa Rosa reverse phone

directory. On two weekends, teams of students from Sonoma State

University physically went into the neighborhood locations seeking to

find willing interviewees at or near the selected addresses. The teams

were successful in locating and interviewing 44 individuals during the

period. We are 70% statistically confident that our sample survey of 44

individuals represents the answers for the entire low-wage population in

Santa Rosa. Of the 44 persons interviewed it should be noted that over

half were 25 years or older and close to half were the primary wage

earner for their families.



<p>The purpose of the interviews was to determine the likely spending

patterns of people making below $8.00 an hour were they to earn a living

wage. A series of questions was asked to determine how low-wage

individuals would most likely spend their increased wages. For the

purposes of the study a $400 a month average increase in disposable

income was assumed for individuals working over 20 hours a week, and a

$200 increase for individuals working less than 20 hours per week.



<p>The results of the study indicate that if all of the 5,391 lowest-wage

individuals living in Santa Rosa made a living wage, they would

circulate in the local economy an additional $23,818,301 per year. This

amount would be spent in the following manner: Housing-11.9%, Auto

Purchases-13.6%, Auto Repairs-6.8%, Clothes-9.1%, Food-6.2%,

Movies-3.0%, Video Rentals-0.8%, Restaurants-5.0%, Credit Card

Debt-8.0%, New Purchases for Home & misc.-9.1%, Vacations/travel-3.0%,

Tapes and CDs-2.3%, Sports Activities-2.3%, Books and Magazines-0.6%,

Schools & Childcare-3.5%, Savings-14.8%.



<p>These amounts are substantial. Santa Rosa auto dealers should know that

they would receive over $4,500,000 in new sales and repair orders given

the implementation of a living wage in the City.



<p>With this new research it now is easier to predict the potential

positive economic benefits from a living wage. Business owners and city

managers everywhere should be joining the Living Wage Movement and

demanding the end to low-wages in the United States. It makes good

economic sense for all of us, and the poor do not have to be poorer.
