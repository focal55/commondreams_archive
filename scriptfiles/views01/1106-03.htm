With most polls showing that well over 80% of Americans support the

bombing in Afghanistan, I recognize that my position is indeed not

popular.  Nonetheless, I am obliged by my conscience to oppose this

action.



<p>Clearly the work of the terrorists on September 11, 2001 was shocking

and horrific and whoever is responsible should be brought to justice.  

I have always believed, however, that the pursuit and capture of

murderous criminals should be accomplished with the least amount of

violence possible.  We Americans rely on that principle every day in

cities and towns across our nation.  We generally do not accept the

bombing of an entire building or city, and the death of scores of

innocent persons, in the pursuit of a criminal.  Fortunately, our law

enforcement professionals do not have policies that allow for that type

of "overkill" either.  The incidents at the MOVE house in Philadelphia

and at the Koresh Compound in Waco are two exceptions where law

enforcement did use massive force to capture a wanted person or

persons.  In both cases, massive property damage and the death of many

innocent men, women, and children were the result.  Most people have

come to see both of those events as examples of law enforcement

overstepping its reach and failing to be patient and creative in their

effort.  



<p>Now back to Afghanistan.  Why do we hold a different standard when the

situation is half a world away?  I don't understand why we are willing

to allow our tax dollars and our sons and daughters to be used to kill

innocent civilians and to level towns and cities in one of the poorest

nations on earth.   Sure, we'd all like to see Bin Laden and his gang

brought to justice, if they are responsible.  But is it worth billions

of dollars, risking our sons and daughters in combat, and killing (even

accidentally) innocent families while they rest in the safety of their

own homes?  



<p>Could we not have been more patient, developed better intelligence about

Bin Laden's whereabouts, and then sent in a massive "SWAT-like" team of

military commandos to capture him?  It seems we should have at least

tried something along these lines before we just went in and started

tearing a country apart.  



<p>Relief agencies are announcing, with increasing alarm, that millions of

Afghan men, women, and children are at extreme risk of dying of

starvation and exposure in the coming weeks of winter.  Many of them are

living in refugee camps along the borders with Iran and Pakistan, where

they have fled to escape the bombing campaign.  Many others who have

stayed in Afghanistan do not have adequate shelter, food supplies, and

clean water.  The bombs have caused this situation.  Isn't it at least

our responsibility to do as much for these persons as we're doing to try

to capture Bin Laden?  Sure the U.S. government is making a contribution

to this effort.  But relief agencies on the ground say the need is much

greater than what the U.S. government is offering.  We Americans ARE the

U.S. government and the bombs being dropped are paid for by our tax

dollars.  That makes us responsible.  Should we not, at least, be

pressing our elected officials to also spend a sufficient amount of our

money in bringing aid to the Afghan people who are as innocent, and in

equally great need, as the persons whose lives were shattered in New

York, Washington, and Pennsylvania on September 11th?   



<p>George Bush recognized this need, when he encouraged America's children

to contribute a dollar to help Afghan children who are affected by the

war.  The need, however, is much greater.  There are two things every

U.S. citizen could do to help.  First, contact your U.S. Representative

and Senators and ask them to do more to aid the innocent Afghan people. 

Secondly, you can make direct contributions of money, food, and

blankets, to one of the non-governmental relief operations.  Detailed

information about how to do this can be found at the websites of the

American Friends Service Committee (<a href="http://www.afsc.org/mediarel.htm" target="_new">www.afsc.org/mediarel.htm</a>) and the

Mennonite Central Committee (<a href="http://www.mennonitecc.ca" target="_new">www.mennonitecc.ca</a>).
