THE DAILY COURIER is a little paper in Grants Pass, Ore., a former mill 

town of about 20,000 people on the Rogue River, ringed by mountains. The high 

school team is the Grants Pass Cavemen. The columnist up there is -- was -- 

Dan Guthrie, who doubles as copy editor. A former teacher, Dan has won 11 

awards for his column (called "Dogwatch") over the past eight years.

<P>On Sept. 15, Guthrie wrote that President Bush "skedaddled" after the 

attacks. "Most of his aides and Cabinet members split for secret locations, 

too."

<P>The airline passengers whose struggle with hijackers is believed to have 

led to the crash in Pennsylvania "are the heroes of this rotten week," he said.

<P>"They put it all on the line. Against their courage the picture of Bush 

hiding in a Nebraska hole becomes an embarrassment."

<P>A huge outcry ensued. Hundreds of people protested. Guthrie got death 

threats.

<P>So publisher Dennis Mack fired him.

<P>Editor Dennis Roler, who had let the column go through, was asked to 

apologize to the readers. He wrote, "Criticism of our chief executive and 

those around him needs to be responsible and appropriate. Labeling him and the 

nation's other top leaders as cowards as the United States tries to unite 

after its bloodiest terrorist attack ever isn't responsible or appropriate."

<P>To which I respond: Criticism of our chief executive and those around him 

needs to be responsible and appropriate?

<P>Since when?

<P>Did the Daily Courier sleep through the Monica feeding frenzy?

<P>Of course it was in bad taste to make those remarks so soon after the 

tragedy. It was a week for coming together in national grief, not for quizzing 

the president on his whereabouts. Guthrie himself says, "I wish I had waited."

<P>I REACHED HIM at home, since he doesn't have an office anymore. Dan said 

the editor told him it had made him feel like a fool to write that apology. 

His co-workers were sympathetic: They draped a flag over his computer, then 

watched him gather his stuff and leave the office.

<P>Many Americans seem willing to give up some freedoms in exchange for 

greater safety. Truckers wait cheerfully in line for three hours to have their 

trucks searched before they drive into Manhattan. Passengers are happy to get 

to the airport earlier. My friend Janice was willing to have a long discussion 

with airport security over whether her eyebrow tweezer would be allowed to 

travel with her.

<P>But freedom of speech may not be among the liberties we are willing to give 

up.

<P>Bill Maher of "Politically Incorrect" lost advertisers when he said the 

plain truth -- that the hijackers were not cowards. Professors, other 

columnists, even a German composer have been fired, disciplined or shunned for 

remarks made around the time of the attacks. The White House press secretary 

denounced Maher, saying that in times like these, "people have to watch what 

they say and watch what they do."

<P>And they will, when they see others being punished for speaking out.

<P>WHEN YOU LOOK up the Grants Pass Daily Courier on the Web, this quote, in 

large letters, is the first thing you see: <i>" 'The theory of a free press is 

that truth will emerge from free discussion, not that it will be presented 

perfectly and instantly in any one account.' </i>-- Walter Lippmann"

<P>The truth of what happened, why it happened and what course we should take 

will emerge, as Lippmann said, as long as the press stays free and people 

don't lose their jobs for failing to "watch what they say." If you want to 

watch what you say, many countries will cheerfully help you out. When we let 

terrorists scare us into relinquishing freedoms that define our society -- 

such as getting to take potshots at the president even at inappropriate times -

- then they truly undermine us. And they start to win.

<P>

Since when does criticism of the chief executive have to be responsible?
