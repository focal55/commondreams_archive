Some people are wondering why the New York

Times and CBS' 60 minutes II would spend two and a

half years investigating war crimes allegedly committed

by former Senator Bob Kerrey 32 years ago in Vietnam.

But this is journalism at its best: it is forcing people to

rethink some important history, not just what happened

on a moonless night in the village of Thanh Phong, but

throughout that horrible war.



         <p>The American people need to know the truth

about the Vietnam War -- it was not, as former President

Ronald Reagan described it, "a noble cause." In truth it

was a vile cause, a dirty, rotten war waged by the most

powerful nation and military on earth against a poor

country struggling for its independence. In such a war,

where the foreign invaders are hated by the vast majority

of the population, we would expect these invaders to

commit certain kinds of atrocities.



         <p>The Kerrey story illustrates this very clearly,

regardless of whose account one chooses to believe.

Among the undisputed facts: Kerrey's squad was on a

mission to assassinate a man he describes as a "pro-

Communist political leader." Along the way they

encountered five unarmed people who offered no

resistance. They killed all of them.



         <p>It is also acknowledged that Thanh Phong was

within a "free fire zone," which meant that anyone living

there -- including the children slaughtered by Kerrey's

squad -- were "the enemy" and could be killed.



         <p>This was truly a war against the people of

Vietnam, as its history indicates. Vietnam was a French

colony until World War II, when the French Vichy (pro-

Nazi) government shared power with the invading

Japanese. After the war the Vietnamese declared

independence, but the French wanted to keep their empire

and Washington backed them with billions of dollars and

weapons.



         <p>The French could not win, but managed to get

control of Vietnam south of the 17th parallel, in a

negotiated agreement at the 1954 Geneva Conference.

This was supposed to be a temporary arrangement until

elections could be held (in 1956) to unify the country. But

the elections never happened because, as Eisenhower

would write in his memoirs, Washington knew that

"possibly 80 percent of the people would have voted for

the Communist Ho Chi Minh."



         <p>In order to keep the Vietnamese people from

freely electing their own government, Washington backed

a series of dictatorships, and created an army for a

"country" -- South Vietnam -- that was itself a creation of

the United States. But that army didn't do much better

than the French, so we had to invade with our own troops

to do the job. That's how Kerry and his Navy Seals ended

up on that mission in 1969.



         <p>Fast forward to 2001. There are two main points

of dispute in the story of Thanh Phong. Kerry claims that

their first five victims were men, although he does not

seem very certain in the TV interview. Squad member

Gerhard Klann recalls that they killed an old man (whom

he says he killed by slitting his throat while Kerry held

him down), a woman and three young children. Klann's

story is backed by a Vietnamese eyewitness, as well as

the five graves (two grandparents with three little ones)

shown on TV.



         <p>In the most chilling part of the story, Klann (and

the Vietnamese witness) say the squad rounded up about

14 women and children and shot them all to death. Kerry

claims they fired into the darkness from a distance of

about 100 yards after thinking they had been fired upon

(he's not sure). Here, too, Kerry's story is weak: one

would not expect to find most of the village dead in a

cluster, from a volley of shots into fired into the dark of

night. Kerry's account also suffers from other

inconsistencies and changes in his story, as documented

in the New York Times' Magazine article.



         <p>But the more important story is that the whole war

was a crime. And our political leaders are the ones who

should bear the blame -- not the soldiers whom they lied

to, telling them they were defending democracy and

freedom and their own country when they sent them to

war halfway across the world.



         <p>But even today, our leaders have yet to face up to

the facts: their only lesson has been that they shouldn't

send ground troops. Hence Washington's current support

for the military and death squads of Colombia, as well as

the slaughter of hundreds of thousands of civilians in

Central America in the 1970s and 80s. These are the real

costs of not facing up to the truth about the Vietnam War.
