            Al Gore is wading back into presidential politics, having this week 

            accepted an invitation to address a big Democratic dinner in Iowa. 

            <P>Gore will have plenty of competition from the usual crowd of Washington 

              Democrats - House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, U.S. Sen. John 

              Kerry and 2000 Democratic challenger Bill Bradley are all making 

              noises about possible runs. But he may also face an unexpected and 

              unpredictable challenger from the party&#039;s progressive wing: 

              Wisconsin Sen. Russ Feingold. 

            <P>It is no secret that Feingold has been nosing around the edges 

              of the 2004 presidential campaign. But there are signals that he 

              might be getting more serious about a run. U.S. News & World Report 

              upped the speculation ante last week, with a short feature suggesting 

              that, while &#034;it&#039;s still less than 50-50 that he&#039;ll 

              run, Wisconsin Sen. Russell Feingold plans to hit college campuses 

              this fall to lay out a progressive Democratic agenda that may turn 

              into his presidential platform.&#034; 

            <P>The U.S. News report suggests that Feingold is &#034;being encouraged 

              to run in 2004 by friends who like his pro-youth, pro-labor and 

              campaign finance reform message.&#034; These &#034;friends&#034; 

              reportedly &#034;think he can energize voters without spending much 

              money. His targets are Bill Bradley and Ralph Nader voters&#034; 

            <P>U.S. News has it about half right. While some Feingold friends 

              are encouraging the senator to run, others are actively discouraging 

              him. On one side is the camp that argues Feingold has what it takes 

              to &#034;pull a John McCain&#034; - running a rebel campaign against 

              politics as usual and the party establishment that might gain even 

              more traction in Democratic primaries than Feingold&#039;s campaign 

              finance reform comrade did in the 2000 Republican contest. On the 

              other side is the camp that argues Feingold, whose record on labor, 

              environmental and international affairs issues is arguably the best 

              in the Senate, should not risk a run in a year when his seat is 

              up for grabs. 

            <P>Both camps make good points. While I have disagreed passionately 

              with Feingold&#039;s votes on a handful of issues - most recently 

              his support for the confirmations of Attorney General John Ashcroft 

              and Interior Secretary Gail Norton - he is a rare progressive force 

              in national politics. Behind the scenes in the Senate, there is 

              simply no better player on issues of globalization, democracy, environmental 

              protection and military oversight and human rights in African, Asia 

              and Latin America. To lose his voice, and his ability to subtlely 

              influence the process, in the Senate would be a tragedy. 

            <P>At the same time, a presidential candidacy by Feingold is simply 

              too intriguing a prospect to casually dismiss. If he can relax enough 

              to let his humor, his compassion and his absolute mastery of the 

              issues show, he has the potential to outshine any of the competitors. 

              More importantly, his take on the issues - which is deeply rooted 

              in the Wisconsin Progressive tradition of distrust of concentrated 

              power and military adventurism - has a tremendous constituency, 

              both within the Democratic Party and beyond it. 

            <P>It is unsettling to imagine a Senate without Feingold, but it is 

              invigorating to imagine a presidential campaign <EM>with</EM> him. 

              Given a choice between caution and the bold gesture, Feingold should 

              opt for the latter. Even if he decides finally against a presidential 

              run, the senator should explore his options for the simple reason 

              that the Democratic discourse would be dramatically energized by 

              the prospect of a Feingold candidacy. </p>
