        W. Bush’s choice of Donald Rumsfeld to be U.S. defense secretary could

        put an unintended spotlight on the role of the Rev. Sun Myung Moon – a

        Bush family benefactor – in funneling millions of dollars to communist

        North Korea in the 1990s as it was developing a missile and nuclear

        weapons program.</font>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 1998, Rumsfeld headed a

        special commission, appointed by the Republican-controlled Congress,

        that warned that North Korea had made substantial progress during the

        decade in building missiles that could pose a potential nuclear threat

        to Japan and parts of the United States.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The extraordinary level of

        resources North Korea and Iran are now devoting to developing their own

        ballistic missile capabilities poses a substantial and immediate danger

        to the U.S., its vital interests and its allies,&quot; said the report

        by Rumsfeld's Commission to Assess the Ballistic Missile Threat to the

        United States.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;North Korea maintains an active WMD [weapons of mass destruction]

        program, including a nuclear weapon program. It is known that North

        Korea diverted material in the late 1980s for at least one or possibly

        two weapons,&quot; the report said.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Rumsfeld’s alarming assessment

        of North Korea’s war-making capabilities now is being cited by

        Republicans as a justification for investing billions of taxpayer

        dollars in an anti-missile defense system favored by Bush and Rumsfeld.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Yet, during the early-to-mid

        1990s, the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency was monitoring a series of

        clandestine payments from Sun Myung Moon's organization to the North

        Korean communist leaders who were overseeing the country's military

        strategies.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to DIA documents

        obtained through the Freedom of Information Act, Moon’s payments to

        North Korean leaders included a $3 million “birthday present” to

        current communist leader Kim Jong Il and offshore payments amounting to

        “several tens of million dollars” to the previous communist

        dictator, Kim Il Sung.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The alleged payments – and broader

        Moon-North Korean business deals reported by the DIA – came at a time

        of a strict U.S. government ban on financial transactions between North

        Korea and any U.S. person or entity, to keep hard currency out of North

        Korea's hands.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Legal experts say that ban would

        have applied to Moon given his status as a permanent U.S. resident, even

        though he maintains South Korean citizenship.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Bush Speeches</b></font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">While negotiating those business

        deals with North Korea in the 1990s, Moon’s organization also hired

        former President George H.W. Bush and former First Lady Barbara Bush to

        give speeches at Moon-sponsored events.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">During one Moon-sponsored speech

        in Argentina in November 1996, former President Bush declared, “I want

        to salute Reverend Moon,” whom Bush praised as “the man with the

        vision.”</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The father of the incoming U.S.

        president has refused to divulge how much Moon’s organization paid for

        these speeches which were delivered in the United States, Asia and South

        America.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Some press estimates have put

        the fees in the hundreds of thousands of dollars, though one former

        leader of Moon’s Unification Church told me that the organization had

        earmarked $10 million for the former president. </font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Ex-President Bush’s pro-Moon

        speeches came at a time, too, when Moon – now 80 – was expressing

        intensely anti-American views. In the mid-1990s, Moon denounced the

        United States as “Satan’s harvest” and condemned American women as

        having descended from a “line of prostitutes.”</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In a speech to his followers on

        Aug. 4, 1996, Moon vowed to liquidate American individuality, declaring

        that his movement would “swallow entire America.” Moon said

        Americans who insisted on “their privacy and extreme individualism …

        will be digested.”</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Beyond these anti-Americanism

        diatribes, other questions have arisen about how Moon finances his

        religious-business-political empire. Evidence has existed back to the

        1970s indicating that Moon’s organization has engaged in

        money-laundering operations and has associated with right-wing

        organized-crime figures in Asia and Latin America.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">One of Moon's key early backers

        was Ryoichi Sasakawa, a leader of Japan's Yakuza organized crime family,

        according to the authoritative book, <i>Yakuza</i>, by David E. Kaplan

        &amp; Alec Dubro. </font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 1998, Moon’s

        ex-daughter-in-law, Nansook Hong, added first-hand testimony about one

        of Moon's money-laundering methods when she described how cash was

        smuggled illegally through U.S. Customs. Moon “demonstrated contempt

        for U.S. law every time he accepted a paper bag full of untraceable,

        undeclared cash” carried into the United States from overseas, she

        wrote in her book, <i>In the Shadows of the Moons</i>.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Checkered Past</b></font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To many Americans, Moon is

        perhaps best known as a 1970s cult leader who allegedly brainwashed

        young recruits into joining his Unification Church and then paired up

        his followers in mass marriages where Moon would preside wearing lavish

        costumes and crowns.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But Moon also understood the

        importance of political clout. In 1978, a congressional investigation

        identified Moon as a part of a covert influence-buying scheme aimed at

        American institutions and run by the South Korean Central Intelligence

        Agency, a charge that Moon denied.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 1982, Moon was convicted of

        tax fraud and served an 18-month sentence in federal prison.

        Nevertheless, his political influence grew when he launched <i>The

        Washington Times,</i> also in 1982.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the years that followed, Moon

        developed a reputation for financing

        all-expense-paid international conferences for conservative politicians,

        prominent journalists and influential academics.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Moon’s conservative newspaper

        grew in importance in Washington through the 1980s and early 1990s, as

        it staunchly supported Republican presidents Ronald Reagan and George

        H.W. Bush.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 1991, President Bush

        expressed his gratitude to Moon’s newspaper by inviting its editor,

        Wesley Pruden, to a private White House lunch “just to tell you how

        valuable the <i>Times</i> has become in Washington, where we read it

        every day.” [<i>Washington Times,</i> May 17, 1992]</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Moving North</b></font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At about the same time as that

        lunch, Moon was beginning another initiative – establishing a business

        foothold in North Korea. The DIA, the Pentagon agency responsible for

        monitoring possible military threats to the United States, started

        keeping tabs on these developments.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Though historically an ardent

        anticommunist, Moon negotiated a sweeping business deal with Kim Il

        Sung, the longtime communist leader, the DIA documents said. The two men

        met face-to-face in North Korea from Nov. 30 to Dec. 8, 1991.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">“These talks took place

        secretly, without the knowledge of the South Korean government,” the

        DIA wrote on Feb. 2, 1994. “In the original deal with Kim [Il Sung],

        Moon paid several tens of million dollars as a down-payment into an

        overseas account,” the DIA said in another cable dated Aug. 14, 1994.</font></p>

<p class="MsoBodyText2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The DIA said Moon's

        organization also delivered money to Kim Il Sung's son and successor,

        Kim Jong Il.</font></p>

<p class="MsoBodyText2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">“In 1993, the

        Unification Church sold a piece of property located in Pennsylvania,”

        the DIA reported on Sept. 9, 1994. “The profit on the sale,

        approximately $3 million was sent through a bank in China to the Hong

        Kong branch of the KS [South Korean] company ‘Samsung Group.’ The

        money was later presented to Kim Jung Il [Kim Jong Il] as a birthday

        present.”</font></p>

<p class="MsoBodyText2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">After Kim Il Sung's

        death in 1994 and his succession by his son, Kim Jong Il, Moon

        dispatched his longtime aide, Bo Hi Pak, to ensure that the business

        deals were still on track with Kim Jong Il “and his coterie,” the

        DIA reported.</font></p>

<p class="MsoBodyText2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">“If necessary,

        Moon authorized Pak to deposit a second payment for Kim Jong Il,” the

        DIA wrote.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As described by the DIA, Moon's

        deal with North Korea called for construction of a hotel complex in

        Pyongyang as well as a new Holy Land at the site of Moon’s birth in

        North Korea.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">“There was an agreement regarding

        economic cooperation for the reconstruction of KN's [North Korea's]

        economy which included establishment of a joint venture to develop

        tourism at Kimkangsan, KN [North Korea]; investment in the Tumangang

        River Development; and investment to construct the light industry base

        at Wonsan, KN. It is believed that during their meeting Mun [Moon]

        donated 450 billion yen to KN,” one DIA report said.</font></p>

<p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In late 1991, the Japanese yen traded at

        about 130 yen to the U.S. dollar, meaning Moon's investment would have

        been about $3.5 billion, if the DIA information is correct.</font></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Pak's

        Response</b></font>

<p style="tab-stops:49.5pt"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Contacted

        in Seoul, South Korea, <span style="font-weight:normal" class="Name">Bo

        Hi Pak</span>, a former publisher of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The

        Washington Times</i>, acknowledged that Moon met with North Korean

        officials and negotiated business deals with them in the early 1990s.</font></p>

<p style="tab-stops:49.5pt"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But Bo Hi Pak denied

        that payments were made to individual North Korean leaders and called

        “absolutely untrue” the DIA's description of the $3 million land

        sale benefiting Kim Jong Il.</font> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Bo Hi

        Pak also said the North Korean business investments were structured

        through South Korean entities.</font></p>

<p style="tab-stops:49.5pt"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">“Rev. Moon is

        not doing this in his own name,” said Pak.</font></p>

<p style="tab-stops:49.5pt"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Pak said he did

        go to North Korea in 1994, after Kim Il Sung’s death, but only to

        express “condolences” to Kim Jong Il on behalf of Moon and his wife.

        Pak denied that another purpose of the trip was to pass money to Kim

        Jong Il or to his associates.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the phone interview, Bo Hi Pak also

        denied that Moon’s investments ever approached $3.5 billion. Pak did

        not give a total figure for the investments, but said the initial phase

        of an automobile factory was in the range of $3 million to $6 million.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The DIA depicted Moon's business plans in

        North Korea as much grander, however. The DIA valued the agreement for

        hotels in Pyongyang and the resort in Kumgang-san, alone, at $500

        million. The plans also called for creation of a kind of Vatican City

        covering Moon's birthplace.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">“In consideration of Mun's [Moon's]

        economic cooperation, Kim [Il Sung] granted Mun a 99-year lease on a 9

        square kilometer parcel of land located in Chongchu, Pyonganpukto, KN.

        Chongchu is Mun's birthplace and the property will be used as a center

        for the Unification Church. It is being referred to as the Holy Land by

        Unification Church believers and Mun [h]as been granted

        extraterritoriality during the life of the lease.”</font></p>

<p style="tab-stops:49.5pt"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">North Korean

        officials clearly valued their relationship with Moon, granting him

        small but symbolic favors. Four months after Moon's 1991 meeting with

        Kim Il Sung, the communist dictator granted a rare interview to editors

        from Moon's <i>Washington Times.</i></font></p>

<p style="tab-stops:49.5pt"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In February

        2000, on Moon's 80th birthday, Kim Jong Il sent Moon a gift of rare wild

        ginseng, an aromatic root used medicinally, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Reuters</i>

        reported.</font></p>

<p style="tab-stops:49.5pt"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Legal Issues</b></font></p>

<p style="tab-stops:49.5pt"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Because of the

        long-term U.S. embargo against North Korea – eased only last year –

        Moon’s alleged payments to the communist leaders raise potential legal

        issues for Moon, a South Korean citizen who is a U.S. permanent resident

        alien.</font></p>

<p style="tab-stops:49.5pt"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><span style="mso-spacerun:

yes">&nbsp;</span>“Nobody

        in the United States was supposed to be providing funding to anybody in

        North Korea, period, under the Treasury (Department's) sanction

        regime,” said <span style="font-weight:normal" class="Name">Jonathan

        Winer</span>, former deputy assistant secretary of state handling

        international crime.</font></p>

<p style="tab-stops:49.5pt"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The U.S. embargo

        of North Korea dates back to the Korean War. With a few exceptions for

        humanitarian goods, the embargo barred trade and financial dealings

        between North Korea and “all U.S. citizens and permanent residents

        wherever they are located, … and all branches, subsidiaries and

        controlled affiliates of U.S. organizations throughout the world.”</font></p>

<p style="tab-stops:49.5pt"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Moon became a

        permanent resident of the United States in 1973, according to Justice

        Department records. Bo Hi Pak said Moon has kept his “green card”

        status. Moon maintains a residence

        near Tarrytown, north of New York City, and controls dozens of

        affiliated U.S. companies.</font></p>

<p style="tab-stops:49.5pt"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Direct payments

        to foreign leaders in connection with business deals also could prompt

        questions about possible violations of the U.S. Corrupt Practices Act, a

        prohibition against overseas bribery.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Political Fallout</b></font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Today, however, the potential

        political fallout might be a greater concern than any legal action,

        especially once George W. Bush assumes the presidency.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For the past two years,

        Republicans have used Rumsfeld's report to club President Clinton and

        Vice President Gore for alleged softness toward a recalcitrant communist

        enemy.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 1999, a House Republican task

        force followed up the work of Rumsfeld's commission and declared that

        North Korea and its missile program had emerged as a nuclear threat to

        Japan and possibly the Pacific Northwest of the United States.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;This threat has advanced

        considerably over the past five years, particularly with the enhancement

        of North Korea's missile capabilities,&quot; said the Republican task

        force. &quot;Unlike five years ago, North Korea can now strike the

        United States with a missile that could deliver high explosive,

        chemical, biological, or possibly nuclear weapons.&quot;</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Ironically, Moon's newspaper

        joined in laying the blame for North Korea's progress at the feet of the

        Clinton-Gore administration.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;To its list of missed

        opportunities, the Clinton-Gore administration can now add the

        abdication of responsibility for national security,&quot; a <i>Washington

        Times</i> editorial stated on Sept. 5, 2000.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Not surprisingly the <i>Times</i>

        did not mention that its founder and financial backer, Sun Myung Moon,

        had lent a hand to North Korea by agreeing to multi-million-dollar

        business deals and allegedly putting millions of dollars in the personal

        accounts of the leaders masterminding the strategic weapons development.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Equally unsurprising, former

        President George H.W. Bush and his about-to-be-president son have never

        explained the family's financial involvement with Rev. Moon, a messianic

        leader who has vowed to build a movement powerful enough to eliminate

        all individuality and freedom in the United States.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Those questions also aren't

        likely to come up at the confirmation hearings for Donald Rumsfeld, who

        believes that the United States must now pursue an expensive missile

        shield&nbsp; to counter the threat posed by North Korea.</font></p>
