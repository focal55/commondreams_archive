Torture predates the development of the corporation. But corporations are

entangled in the modern-day commerce in devices of torture.



<p>In a new report, Amnesty International shines a spotlight on the makers of

law enforcement equipment and how their devices are used by torturers

around the world (including in the United States).



<p>Amnesty has compiled a list of more than 80 U.S. manufacturers and

suppliers of electro-shock weapons and restraints. Amnesty does not allege

that any one or another of these companies is involved in the

international trade in equipment used in torture. But Amnesty's report,

"Stopping the Torture Trade," does provide numerous examples of U.S.

products being used by torturers overseas, as well as in the United

States.



<p>We thought it'd be interesting to call up these companies and ask: Do you

sell to known human rights abusers? Do you screen the persons or agencies

to whom you sell domestically, to make sure they are not selling or

exporting them to human rights abusers?



<p>So we started calling through the list. What immediately became apparent

is the extent to which the industry is populated by small equipment makers

and even smaller suppliers and distributors. As answering machines picked

up call after call to the companies' main numbers, it became obvious how

tiny most of these operations are.



<p>Some of the equipment makers and sellers we reached were familiar with the

Amnesty report, and some weren't. Not surprisingly, of the ones we

reached, and who agreed to speak with us, none tried to justify the use of

their equipment for torture.



<p>Several of the companies said they only sell to domestic law enforcement

agencies. That's not totally comforting to those aware of the brutal

practices of far too many police in the United States, but it is hard to

fault the companies for selling legitimate law enforcement equipment (such

as handcuffs) to domestic police forces.



<p>None of the domestic-only companies to which we spoke employ measures to

block resale and export, though the companies selling to law enforcement

agencies argued that those agencies were unlikely to sell their equipment

abroad.



<p>We talked to one of the handful of major corporate players in the law

enforcement equipment business, Peerless Handcuffs. Their spokesperson

refused to give us his name.



<p>Peerless does export a variety of restraints, including leg cuffs.



<p>The chapter of Amnesty's report on restraints used in torture begins with

a gruesome anecdote from southern Lebanon. The Khiam detention center,

closed in May 2000, "had been run by the South Lebanon Army, Israel's

proxy militia in the former occupied south Lebanon, with the involvement

of the Israeli army, but the handcuffs used to suspend detainees from an

electricity pylon where they were doused with water and given electric

shocks were clearly marked "The Peerless Handcuff Co. Springfield, Mass.

Made in USA,'" Amnesty reports.



<p>In a letter to Amnesty, Peerless expressed disgust that its products were

used in the Khiam prison, stating, "In no way does Peerless Handcuff

Company condone or support the use of our products for torture or for any

other human rights abuse. … We have not sold any restraints to the Israeli

government or Israeli companies in almost 10 years."



<p>We asked our anonymous representative at Peerless, Do you take steps to

control the sale of equipment to torturers? "We restrict our sales as best

we can to what we know are legitimate law enforcement authorities," he

replied.



<p>Since it is often the case that it is "legitimate" law enforcement

authorities who are the torturers, we asked if Peerless has refused

orders.



<p>The answer is yes. The company refuses to sell to, among other countries,

China, North Korea, Iran and Iraq, and has turned down sales requests from

these and other nations. But it is not as if Peerless is reading Amnesty

International reports before establishing its sales screens.



<p>"We have no interest in promoting" sales to torturers, the Peerless

spokesperson said. But, he added, "I don’t think manufacturers can be held

responsible" for misuse by law enforcement agencies.



<p>We don't agree. Anyone selling equipment prone to abuse by torturers has a

special obligation to make sure it doesn't wind up in the hands of people

with a record of human rights abuses.



<p>However, what is clear from our brief survey of some of the equipment

makers and suppliers is that a corporate liability system will not

adequately address the problem. The companies are too small and diffuse to

be controlled exclusively through such mechanisms. One that closes today

can reopen tomorrow under another name. Governmental regulation is

essential.



<p>Amnesty International is urging the United States and other governments to

ban the use, manufacture, promotion and trade of police and security

equipment whose use is inherently cruel, inhuman or degrading. The group

includes leg irons, electro-shock stun belts and inherently painful

devices such as serrated thumbcuffs in this category. Amnesty is calling

for a suspension on the use and trade in devices, such as electro-shock

equipment, whose medical effects are not fully known. Amnesty is also

calling for a suspension of trade in equipment that has shown a

substantial risk of abuse or unwarranted injury, including equipment such

as legcuffs, thumbcuffs, restraint chairs and pepper gas weapons.



<p>It is crucially important that the United States act immediately in these

areas, says Amnesty International USA spokesperson Alistair Hodgett. The

United States has led the way in the development of new technologies used

in torture, such as electro-shock devices. After export, they have quickly

been replicated and spread around the world.



<p>There's no significant lobby for law enforcement equipment exports -- U.S.

exports total only about $32 million a year. There's no conceivable excuse

for a failure to stop the torture trade.
