WASHINGTON -- During the first days of spring, cold winds blew 

through the nation's capital. The weather was an apt metaphor for the 

chilling effects of a perennial news industry desensitized to its own 

numbing. Don't worry, we've been told countless times: Media outlets are 

diverse enough to maintain vigilance.



<p>"I have yet to see a piece of writing, political or non-political, 

that doesn't have a slant," E.B. White observed in a 1956 essay. To that 

candid assessment he added a more dubious one: "The beauty of the American 

free press is that the slants and the twists and the distortions come from 

so many directions, and the special interests are so numerous, the reader 

must sift and sort and check and countercheck in order to find out what the 

score is. This he does."



<p>I thought of such claims the other day, while passing through the 

National Press Building lobby. Eight networks were on eight television 

screens. With the possible exception of the Weather Channel, they all 

certainly had slants. Two eminent members of the punditocracy occupied two 

screens. The odious Don Imus was on another. Investor news was also 

profuse. Lots of slants. But not from many directions.



<p>The media industry -- no less than the campaign system -- is awash 

in oceans of dollars. Commercial broadcasters siphon huge profits from 

frequencies that theoretically belong to the public. Cable TV conglomerates 

expand under the protection of federal regulations placing severe limits on 

the power of municipalities to charge franchise fees for the use of public 

rights-of-way. Station owners proceed to cash in on their free portions of 

a digital spectrum worth billions of dollars.



<p>We're hearing a lot about the need for campaign finance reform -- 

but how often have we heard the phrase "media finance reform"?



<p>Assurances about the present-day media system often resemble the 

more complacent defenses of how politicians get elected. In late March, 

lauding "the classic Madisonian structure of American democracy," 

syndicated columnist Charles Krauthammer wrote: "Madison saw 'factions,' 

what we now call interests, not only as natural, but as beneficial to 

democracy because they inevitably check and balance each other."



<p>But the phrase "check and balance" deserves another look -- in a 

financial context. The big checks and big (bank) balances are hardly 

reassuring.



<p>Complacency rests on mythology, as when Krauthammer cites Madison: 

"His solution to the undue power of factions? More factions. Multiply them 

-- and watch them mutually dilute each other." However, when we "watch 

them," any such "solution" becomes implausible. Power is steadily more 

concentrated, not diluted.



<p>The media establishment has a hefty stake in the status quo. A 

curb on campaign spending would eat into profits. Last year, an estimated 

$1 billion in campaign-ad revenue flowed to TV stations. And during the 

2000 election cycle, "soft money" campaign contributions totaled more than 

$5.5 million from the corporate owners of five powerhouse networks -- Time 

Warner (CNN), Walt Disney (ABC), News Corp. (Fox), Viacom (CBS) and General 

Electric (NBC).



<p>But even if big donors vanished from campaign financing, we'd 

still be left with the crying need for media finance reform. If those who 

pay the piper call the tune, why is that any less true in news media than 

in politics?



<p>Midway through the Senate debate on the McCain-Feingold bill, a 

Washington Post editorial declared: "The goal should be to reduce the flow 

of funds, the extent to which offices and policies now are all but openly 

bought by the interest groups that the policies affect." The newspaper 

added that with so much big money flowing into the coffers of senators, 

"There is no way they cannot be beholden."



<p>That's true. And when you consider America's major media outlets 

-- and the massive corporate ownership and advertising involved -- the same 

conclusion should be inescapable. "There is no way they cannot be beholden."



<p>Free and open discourse is essential to democracy. But no one on 

the Senate floor has demanded the taming of the nation's media giants. Amid 

all the talk about the sanctity of the First Amendment, we don't hear 

politicians or mainstream pundits insisting that multibillion-dollar 

conglomerates be pushed off its windpipe. As a practical matter, the top 

guarantee in the Bill of Rights is gasping for breath. Free speech is of 

limited value when freedom to be heard requires big bucks.

weekly syndicated column focuses on media and politics.</i>
