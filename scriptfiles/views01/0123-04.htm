I'M ONE of the idiots who figured George W. wouldn't do much damage as 

president. He struck me as someone whose conservative principles would be 

tempered by generational realities.

<P>  In other words, because he had spent nearly his entire adult life in a 

country where abortion was legal, and because he is the father of two 

daughters and husband to a woman who is pro-choice, he would understand why 

abortion needs to be available to women, even if he is personally opposed to 

it.

</P>

<P>  I believed him when he said his top priorities were education and tax cuts.

</P>

<P>  Today, I feel as stupid and gullible as the California Legislature's 

deregulation advocates.

</P>

<P>  Yesterday, on Bush's very first workday as president, he announced he would 

block U.S. financial aid to international family-planning organizations that 

provide abortion and/or abortion counseling. Let's be clear. These 

organizations do not use the U.S. money to pay for abortions. Even under 

Clinton that was illegal and has been since 1973. What Bush is doing is 

yanking all aid to all organizations that have the temerity to spend their own 

money on providing abortions.

</P>

<P>  This ban comes from a man whose scope of international travel begins and 

ends in Mexico. Bush has no clue about life in an African village or an 

overcrowded slum in India. Do you think he knows that 585,000 women in Third 

World countries die each year of pregnancy-related complications, according to 

the World Health Organization? Do you think he knows how many women die 

drinking pesticides or bleach attempting to end their pregnancies? Does he 

know how many lives are saved by the wide range of work these organizations do,

</P>

<P>aside from abortions?

</P>

<P>  He can't know or he couldn't have said, with a straight face, that he made 

this decision because life is precious.

</P>

<P>  "Funding for reproductive health and rights is an issue of life and death 

for women," said Kavita N. Ramdas, president and CEO of the Global Fund for 

Women. "Instead of being a champion of women's rights, Bush shows the United 

States will set them back tremendously."

</P>

<P>  But wait! There's more!

</P>

<P>  It wasn't enough that Bush nominated two diehard abortion opponents to his 

Cabinet in John Ashcroft and Tommy Thompson, or that he is imposing this ban 

on international funding. Bush also said yesterday he was ordering a review of 

the government's approval four months ago of the RU-486 abortion pill.

</P>

<P>  "I'm not surprised," said Belle Taylor-McGhee, the executive director of 

California Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League. "But this is a 

sobering reminder that Bush is going to push his anti-abortion agenda, despite 

what Americans feel about the issue. Look, women are dying around the world. 

It's not compassionate conservatism to say to women in undeveloped countries 

that we're going to make your decisions about what's best for you."

</P>

<P>  If people are surprised by Bush's actions, Taylor-McGhee said, it's because 

the media didn't press him enough about abortion during the campaign. I agree, 

and I plead guilty. I remember interviewing Bush last year and asking him why 

he was pro-life. He stammered a bit before answering, "My pro-life position is 

I believe there's life. It's not necessarily based in religion. I think 

there's a life there, therefore the notion of life, liberty and pursuit of 

happiness."

</P>

<P>  His fuzzy answer suggested to me at the time that abortion wasn't a burning 

issue for him. Now, I know that he wasn't being lukewarm but simply 

inarticulate.

</P>

<P>  I underestimated Bush. I didn't pay close enough attention. I still believe 

he's in over his head as president. But now I know better than to think he 

won't do much damage. One day in office and he already has.
