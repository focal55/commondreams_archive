Thanks to conservative author David Horowitz’s recent lecture at the 

University of Texas, I have new hope for radical political organizing on 

campus.



<p>Many of us on the faculty with left/progressive values have felt rather 

isolated on what we all thought was a conservative campus. But it turns out 

that all this time we’ve been working in a nest of left-wing radicals who 

have over-run the place, leaving conservatives cowering in silence.



<p>At least that’s Horowitz’s analysis. University faculties around the 

country, including UT, are “skewed far to the left” as a result of 

conservative professors being “systematically purged,” according to 

Horowitz, a one-time leftist turned right-winger.



<p>My colleagues and I are hoping Horowitz will help us find where all these 

radicals are hiding; more company would be nice.



<p>In the decade I’ve been at UT, a handful of faculty members have been 

willing to get involved in left/progressive causes. Events and actions that 

address racism, sexism, militarism or corporate domination usually involve 

the same small group of committed folks.



<p>If the “left-wingers run the universities” claim were coming only from 

Horowitz, it wouldn’t be cause for much concern. The political analysis 

that comes out of his “Center for the Study of Popular Culture” is so 

consistently loopy that he’s hard to take seriously.



<p>But this assertion about left-wing dominance of universities is repeated so 

often throughout the culture that it has become widely accepted. The fact, 

however, is that the typical American university is dominated by centrist 

to moderately conservative faculty members and administrators, with steady 

movement to the right in the past two decades.



<p>At UT, for example, there are some professors -- mostly scattered 

throughout the liberal arts and social sciences -- who might reasonably be 

called left or progressive, a few even radical. But in my experience the 

majority of faculty members run from liberal Democrats to conservative 

Republicans.



<p>In some places on campus -- the well-funded McCombs School for Business 

comes to mind -- it would be silly to argue that the ideology of professors 

is skewed even mildly to the left; they are bastions of conservatism where 

no critique of the basic nature of corporate capitalism is voiced.



<p>More and more, universities are influenced by the wealthy donors and 

corporations that exercise increasing power as public funding for higher 

education shrinks. Professors, no matter what the nature of their research, 

are being told that attracting outside funding is increasingly a 

requirement for tenure and promotion.



<p>That means that people doing work that critiques the fundamental 

assumptions of powerful institutions in this culture (one reasonable 

definition of a “leftist”) are becoming even more marginalized. Not 

“systematically purged,” as happened during the McCarthy era, but squeezed 

out by a system that values conformity and subordination to power more than 

deep critique.



<p>I am not so naïve as to expect institutions to go out of their way to 

foster dissent; institutions tend to reproduce the relationships of power 

in the wider society, and universities are no different.



<p>But we should put away the fantasy that radicals are running the show and 

begin to ask seriously whether our society cares about maintaining 

universities as a place for independent critical inquiry.



<p>This is not a plea for sympathy for poor lonely radicals on campus. As a 

tenured professor, I enjoy a freedom to pursue my intellectual interests 

that is available virtually nowhere else in the culture, and I’m grateful 

for that freedom. But I worry that graduate students and younger colleagues 

coming up through the ranks won’t enjoy that same freedom.



<p>That should be of concern not just to aspiring academics but to a society 

that wants to call itself democratic. If higher education is not a place 

for critical self-reflection on the powerful, we’re all in trouble.
