HOW MUCH of our national resources -- money, research, work hours -- 

would you have been willing to spend if it meant saving the thousands of 

Americans who died from terrorist attacks on September 11?

<P>And what resources would you now allocate to lift the anxiety that those 

deaths, and the subsequent deaths from anthrax, have generated across the 

country?

<P>Most of us, I imagine, would spend whatever it would take. What is more 

valuable than the lives of fathers and mothers and best friends and sons and 

daughters? What is more precious than living free from daily fear?

<P>Yet, Americans are killed every day on our streets. Their deaths are no 

less debilitating and tragic to their friends and families than those on 

September 11. The fear left behind is no less chilling.

<P>Last year alone, more than 10,000 Americans were murdered by gunshots. More 

than 530,000 victims of violent crimes faced attackers carrying guns. These 

terrorists don't fit a particular profile. They don't slip into the country on 

student visas. They don't subscribe to a common set of twisted religious 

beliefs.

<P>But they take more American lives every single year than any outside 

terrorists ever have. In fact, since 1965 about 1 million Americans have died 

of gunshot wounds in our homeland, more than the number of American who were 

killed in all foreign wars during the 20th century (617,000).

<P>"Whole communities have been terrorized by gunfire for a very, very long 

time," said Philip Cook, Duke University professor and co-author of "Gun 

Violence: The Real Costs." "But this is not just a problem for the poor and 

disenfranchised. The impact is much broader than the people who are killed. It 

affects property values, taxes, schools, quality of life."

<P>In the wake of the 5,000 or so deaths on September 11, President Bush 

allocated $11 billion for anti-terrorism efforts, which included the creation 

of a new Office of Homeland Security headed by Tom Ridge. Yet,the Centers for 

Disease Control and Prevention can't get even $10 million from the president 

to create a national, centralized database on homicides and suicides.

<P>It's astonishing that such a system doesn't yet exist. Researchers and 

policymakers looking for information on violent deaths have to piece together 

reports from medical examiners, coroners, police, crime labs, the FBI, the 

Department of Justice, the death-certificate registrars and the CDC.

<P>"The federal government can tell you how many women dye their hair each 

year but can't tell you how many women are killed by guns in domestic violence 

situations," said Stephen Hargarten, director of the Firearm Injury Center at 

the Medical College of Wisconsin.

<P>Comprehensive information is crucial to formulating policies that would 

decrease gun violence. "Right now, we're dealing with a lot of rhetoric 

without any real facts," said David Hemenway, director of the Harvard Injury 

Control Research Center at the Harvard School of Public Health. "How many 

assault-weapon killings are there? Where do teen suicide victims get their 

guns?"

<P>And why, for example, were just two people killed with handguns in New 

Zealand in 1996, 13 in Australia, 15 in Japan, 30 in Britain and 9,390 in the 

United States?

<P>When the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration began collecting 

data on every highway death, the number of deaths dramatically decreased. 

Policymakers could pinpoint how and why people died in cars and advocate 

specific reforms, such as seat-belt laws and collapsible steering columns.

<P>Clearly, the feds know no battle can be won without solid facts. Right now, 

they are desperate for information about the foreign terrorists and the 

anthrax attacks. Without good info, they can't know who or what they're 

fighting.

<P>By contrast, information about gun violence is easily attainable, but is 

too scattered to be of much use. The CDC is pushing for $10 million in the 

2002 budget for the National Violent Injury Statistics System, increasing to 

$20 million a year thereafter when it is fully operational.

<P>It won't eliminate gun violence. But it might finally give us a fighting 

chance against a terrorism that is, unfortunately, too distinctly American.</p>
