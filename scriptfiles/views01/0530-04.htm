Finally, some good news!

<p>After five months of Republican onslaught, Democrats and progressives got a huge boost when Vermont Senator Jim Jeffords abandoned the Republican Party.</p>

<p>His blast at the Republicans was sweet music, and you could almost hear 50 million Americans cheering in unison.</p>

<p>The shift in Senatorial power offers the first possibility of preventing some of the damage that Bush has in store.</p>

<p>But once the giddiness wears off, and it's beginning to already, progressives should hold the Democrats to a high standard.</p>

<p>Yes, a patients' bill of rights is important.</p>

<p>Yes, increasing the minimum wage is important.</p>

<p>Yes, blocking drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is important.</p>

<p>Yes, defeating rightwing judicial appointments is important.</p>

<p>And yes, putting the breaks on Star Wars is important.</p>

																

<p>But Democrats need to aim higher. </p>

<p>Domestically, they need to put back on the table a single-payer plan to ensure that the 43 million Americans without health insurance can at last get medical care.</p>

<p>They need to lift up the one out of five kids in this country who are in poverty.</p>

<p>And they need to rebuild a floor so that no American, at whatever age, has to suffer the stings of homelessness and hunger.</p>

<p>On foreign policy, the two most burning issues today are the Israeli-Palestinian crisis and the civil war in Colombia.</p>

<p>Democrats should demand that Israel withdraw from the Occupied Territories, and Democrats must pressure Bush not to support the Colombian military but to help broker a peace agreement there.</p>

<p>Some of these positions will require courage; others will require a new progressive conviction.</p>

<p>But there's a progressive majority in America: 53 percent of those who voted in November went for Gore or Nader.</p>

																<p>Now that this majority has power in the Senate, it should use that power for the greater good.</p>
