As fighters from the Northern Alliance dare further into northern 

Afghanistan, the Bush administration is struggling to answer the tricky question of who would govern Kabul if the Taliban abandon the capital. 

Secretary of State Colin L. Powell is going to take up the issue today in New 

York, when he meets with his Russian counterpart, representatives of 

Afghanistan's six neighbors, and United Nations officials. 

<p>



There's been much talk about how to establish a broad-based post-Taliban 

government that would guarantee the rights of women and ethnic minorities. 

Powell has been particularly clear that he doesn't 

want to see a repeat of what happened last time the elements that now 

comprise the Northern Alliance entered Kabul in the 1990s. What followed then 

was a brutal internecine civil war that left that city and most of  the 

country in ruins. Washington didn't use the words then, but each group did 

its best to "ethnically cleanse" their region. <A HREF="http://www.workingforchange.com/article.cfm?itemid=12070" target="_new">Afghan women call it the "dark 

times"</A> of abduction, forced "marriage" and rape.

<p>



"We have seen what has happened previously when you had an uncontrolled 

situation and two forces arriving in Kabul at the same time not meaning each 

well," Powell told NBC this weekend. <p>



Meanwhile, Donald Rumsfeld has his eyes on the delicate world of global 

diplomacy.  As most folks have probably figured out by now, every player in 

the U.S.-led war against the Taliban has a self-interest that conflicts with 

just about every other player. Russia has backed the Northern Alliance for 

years, along with India. They want their closest proxies to be in charge in 

Kabul. Pakistan helped to create the Taliban. They don't want to lose their 

investment when it comes to a new government in their neighbor, Afghanistan. 

President Musharraf has suggested that Taliban "moderates" (whatever that 

might mean) deserve a place in a new regime. <p>



"On the one hand, you've got Taliban and Al Qaeda in Kabul, and anyone would 

want them out," he said on CBS on Sunday. "You would want to free the Afghan 

people from the oppressive regime of the Taliban and Al Qaeda in that city. 

You certainly would want to try to do it in a time, in a way that it was 

clear to the world, to the Afghan people, to the neighboring countries, that 

everyone understood that the new post-Taliban leadership in that country 

would be broadly based." <p>



Consistently left out of this so-called "broad government" are the broads, to put it crudely. For all its talk, no one in this picture has seriously begun to address the 

role of women in any future form of government in Afghanistan. And although 

several organization including Amnesty International, the Feminist Majority, 

RAWA, Equality Now!, The Global Center for Women's Leadership and  the 

Women's Alliance for Peace and Human Rights in Afghanistan, are actively 

campaigning for women to be involved and some have met with the Bush 

Administration and with the UN Secretary General privately, when it comes to 

formal planning meetings, Afghan women's groups seem so far to have been shut 

out. <p>



Last month when anti-Taliban Northern Alliance leaders met in Peshawar, 

women's rights weren't on the agenda. Now world leaders are meeting at the UN 

and they too, have apparently agreed that it is too complicated, too 

difficult, and generally not necessary to include women's organizations in 

their talks.  If history is any guide, Northern Alliance claims of victory 

are likely to be heavily inflated. Any new government in Kabul could still be 

years away, but it is telling that at this moment, not one of the many 

organizations representing Afghan women or more generally women's human 

rights have been invited to the table. 

<p>



"Countless women have been working on issues of peace and security for 

decades and have expertise and insights into terrorist violence and 

methodology," says a statement from the Women's Caucus for Gender Justice at 

the United Nations.  The Caucus has drawn up a <A HREF="http://www.whrnet.org/12points.html" target="_new">12-point plan for 

stopping the war and rebuilding a just society in Afghanistan</A>. Now signed by over 1,000 

individuals and groups from around the world, the petition was personally 

presented to each member of the UN Security Council last month.



<p>



United Nations Security Council resolution 1325 specifically mandated that 

women should be given increased decision-making power with regard to conflict 

prevention and resolution. That resolution, passed last year, requires  the 

UN to "ensure the equal participation and full involvement" of women "in all 

efforts for the maintenance and promotion of peace and security." <p>



There's no disputing that women have been singled out for discrimination and 

abuse for years inside Afghanistan, most dramatically, if not exclusively, by 

the Taliban. In a war situation, women always play a disproportionate role in 

the care of the hungry and the injured and bear the greatest burden of 

poverty and destitution. <p>



The Northern Alliance can't get anywhere near Kabul without U.S. military and 

diplomatic support and at least at home, the U.S. claims that at least that part of 

this fight, as Bush put it last week -- is to topple a regime "under which 

women are imprisoned in their homes." While world leaders are talking about 

"broad fronts" and not alienating rival forces, they must not be allowed to 

abandon the women of Afghanistan and the region.  Women can't be put on the backburner again. They've been burning for too long. <p>
