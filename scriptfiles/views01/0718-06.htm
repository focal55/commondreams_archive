THE GEORGE W. BUSH administration's decision to negotiate a settlement of

the federal multibillion-dollar lawsuit against the tobacco industry is another

example of this administration's belief that public policy disputes are better

solved at the state level of government rather than the federal level.

<P>

    Conservatives have long argued that states are "closer" to the needs and

wants of their citizens. Hence, it is this level of government that supposedly

ought to decide public policy even toward such controversial industries as

tobacco, alcohol and gambling. But this devolution of power often allows these

"sin" industries to utilize divide-and-conquer strategy in their dealings with

state governments.

<P>

    Critics of the Bush administration worry that it is merely letting the

tobacco industry off the hook. But one can easily view this decision as one of

many that have empowered the states to be the focal point of public policy.

<P>

    The recent decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of

Columbia, which threw out the ruling that Microsoft be broken up, adds to the

role of the state as chief public policy enforcer. The court left open the

possibility that the state attorneys general could still sue Microsoft because

of its monopoly power, particularly as Microsoft attempts to launch Windows XP.

<P>

    While conservatives have long placed an abiding trust in the abilities of

state governments to solve social problems, the ability of states to be the

chief formulators and implementers of public policy does have some interesting

economic and ethical consequences.

<P>

    States compete with one another for economic resources, especially in their

never-ending search for additional sources of revenue. The cigarette excise tax

is the classic example of a public policy measure where this state level of

competition can have less than desirable results. A demonstration of this is

the relationship between Massachusetts and New Hampshire. Currently, New

Hampshire's excise tax on cigarettes is 52 cents a pack, while Massachusetts'

excise tax is 76 cents a pack. In addition, since there is no sales tax in New

Hampshire, a Massachusetts cigarette smoker could save more than $5 on a carton

of cigarettes by buying that carton in New Hampshire.

<P>

    Since the same holds true for purchase of alcoholic beverages (which are

sold directly by the state government of New Hampshire), many residents of

Massachusetts make the journey to their northern neighboring state in order to

purchase their "sin" products. It would appear that New Hampshire has adopted a

"business" strategy of lowering its price in order to gain market share, while

Massachusetts is attempting to milk all of the revenue it can obtain from its

remaining cigarette smokers.

<P>

    While the states have remained free to enact public policy in a fashion

they deem acceptable, one must wonder whether a more consistent and coherent

public policy towards the cigarette-smoking issue would not benefit the common

good.

<P>

    Every state claims to have as one of its goals decreasing cigarette sales.

<P>

Yet, the actions of many states make it plain that they are more interested in

increasing cigarette sales while shifting health costs to neighboring states.

<P>

The same could also be said for issues such as alcohol, gambling, the Internet

and environmental concerns.

<P>

    This lack of concern over the common good is the troubling aspect of the

tendency to push public policy concerns to the states. Americans typically

bristle at the thought that Big Brother in Washington is making regulations

that have shown little or no concern for local interests. Yet, there are issues

about which a national consensus must be achieved, and then the federal

government needs to act.

<P>

    Currently, the thorniest issue facing the European Union is achieving

uniformity over a variety of issues. Many members of the EU still insist that

they have the right to determine public policy over taxation, working

conditions and environmental standards. Supporters of a stronger EU try to use

the United States as an example of a country that has overcome regional

differences in order to have uniform policies.

<P>

    It is somewhat ironic that as the Europeans are trying to obtain some sort

of coherent public policy infrastructure, public policy makers in the United

States are willing to transfer power to the states.

<P>

    In order to avoid the debate over whether the freedom of the individual

takes precedence over the common good, our national officials are seemingly

passing on to the states (without any additional revenue) a multitude of public

policy controversies. In many cases, the states are not equipped to handle

policy issues such as tobacco, alcohol and gambling in the best interest of the

country as a whole.
