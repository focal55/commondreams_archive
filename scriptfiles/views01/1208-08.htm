It is unprecedented in our history for a government

to take advantage of both war and economic recession to

fleece the American people. During the Vietnam War we

got Medicare and Medicaid, and during World War II there

were profit and price controls, not to mention

unemployment falling to 1.2 percent. The Great Depression

brought us Social Security and unemployment insurance.



         <p>But the Bush Administration has discovered that

September 11 was different: an attack for the first time

since the Civil War on the American mainland, with

thousands buried in the wreckage of a smoldering inferno

as the nation watched helplessly. The American people

were, and to some degree still are, in a state of shock. This

opens up all kinds of opportunities for those who are

unscrupulous enough to take advantage of the public's

increased reliance on government to provide both physical

and economic security.



         <p>Thus we have seen the House majority pass an

"economic stimulus" package that not even conservative

economists would consider a stimulus, with most of the

money going for tax breaks to corporations and the very

rich (households with income of more than a million

dollars a year). While jobs evaporate at the fastest rate in 20

years, the airlines get $15 billion from Congress, and their

laid-off employees get nothing. And every wasteful and

destructive project from missile defense to drilling the

Arctic National Wildlife Refuge has been repackaged and

hawked as a vital component of the War Against Terrorism.



         <p>When they said, "United We Stand," who knew

how small the group described by "We" really was?



         <p>All of this is an outrage, and will eventually be

understood as such. But the most dangerous development

has been the Administration's assault on our civil liberties

and freedoms. The detention of hundreds of people who,

the authorities concede, are not even suspected to be

connected with terrorism; the expansion of police powers

for wiretapping, secret searches, and surveillance, even of

previously protected conversations between attorney and

client; and most menacing, President Bush's executive

order authorizing secret military tribunals, without appeal

to civilian courts, to try and even to execute non-citizens

accused of links to "terrorism."



         <p>For the sake of truth in advertising, we should put a

sign for visitors at our airports and borders: "Warning: you

have no rights in this country. Do not be fooled by our

Constitution and Bill of Rights, or the appearance of the

rule of law. If you are not a US citizen, these do not apply

to you. You may as well be in Burma."



         <p>The expanded police powers apply to citizens, too.

Mostly they will legitimize what the FBI has been doing

illegally for decades. In the 1960s the Bureau ran an

enormous, centrally directed domestic "Counterintelligence

Program" which targeted civil rights organizers (including

Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., described in a high-level FBI

memo as "the most dangerous Negro in the future of this

Nation,"), peace groups and other dissidents. Their tactics

included infiltration, blackmail, disruption of legal political

activity, and covert media operations to discredit political

opponents.



         <p>Most people think these illegal domestic operations

ended in 1972 with the death of the FBI's extremist

director, J. Edgar Hoover. But in fact they continued well

into the 1980s -- targeting thousands of religious, student,

and other activists opposed to US foreign policy in Central

America -- and even into the 90s. The pretext for the FBI's

abuses in the 1980s was a spurious charge that peace

activists were linked to "terrorism."



         <p>This sordid record should give us a preview of what

the Orwellian-named "USA-Patriot Act," passed by

Congress on October 25, is likely to deliver. President

Bush's executive order also indicates that the

Administration is trying to intimidate dissent: actions that

cause or threaten to cause "adverse effects on the United



States [or] its foreign policy" are included in the order's

definition of "international terrorism."



         <p>If these keeps up, we won't have to worry about

terrorists destroying our way of life: our own government

will have done it for them.
