Recently, the United Nations General Assembly held a special session to address the extremely urgent health, social and security crisis presented by the global pandemic of HIV/AIDS. A global solution to the crisis is urgently needed, but any solution will not be quick, cheap or easy, and must go beyond calls for inexpensive anti-viral drugs, or &quot;drug cocktails,&quot; that are used to successfully treat AIDS patients in the United States. The problem is not merely the high cost of treatment, but the grossly inadequate public health, medical, and social infrastructure to deliver an effective prevention and treatment program in the most severely affected countries.<br>

<br>

A successful strategy for battling the AIDS crisis must include effective prevention efforts in addition to medical treatment for people already infected with the disease. World leaders must also change their thinking and address the health concerns and needs of the poor people, homosexuals, injection drug users, sex workers and society&#39;s other marginalized people who are the most vulnerable to HIV infection.<br>

<br>

Many Americans do not understand the complexities of the AIDS epidemic. We&#39;ve been deluded into viewing AIDS as a &quot;treatable condition&quot; instead of a deadly disease that threatens the security of the world. Since the beginning of the epidemic 20 years ago, more than 22 million people have died of AIDS. The World Health Organization estimates that 36 million people are infected with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. Nearly 90 percent of them are in developing countries, and more than two-thirds -- an estimated 25 million infected persons -- are in sub-Saharan Africa.<br>

<br>

The impact of AIDS in these African countries has been dramatic. Almost one in 10 adults between the ages of 15 to 49 years is infected with the virus. In these nations, most of the people with HIV infection become sick and die within five years of infection. During that time, they receive little or no treatment, they are unable to work, and they are at risk of spreading HIV to many more people, including their spouses and their newborn children.<br>

<br>

Most of the AIDS-affected countries in Africa have per-capita incomes below $500 per year, or about 50-fold less than the average American. They will need substantial financial help to mount effective HIV prevention and treatment programs. To put this in perspective, some drug combination therapies now cost as little as $1 a day, but in the small African nation of Lesotho the average yearly income is only $65. At that rate, it would take over five years wages to pay for one year of AIDS treatment.<br>

<br>

<SUBHED><FONT SIZE=+1>Prevention and control</FONT><br>

<br>

</SUBHED> To move forward with an effective AIDS program, science, rather than narrow and biased political concerns, must guide the discussions. Scientists know that certain medications suppress AIDS by lowering the levels of virus in the body. We also know that high-risk behaviors, such as injection drug use and some sexual practices, increase the risk of contracting and spreading HIV infection.<br>

<br>

There are good examples of successful programs to control the spread of HIV, such as the widespread condom promotion programs in Thailand and, more recently, Cambodia and Uganda, and the adoption of &quot;safe sex&quot; as normative behavior among gay and bisexual men and many heterosexuals in the United States and other developed Western countries.<br>

<br>

Brazil has offered anti-viral AIDS drugs to roughly 90,000 HIV-infected people and the mortality rate for AIDS has decreased by more than 50 percent in the past few years. However, despite these few successful examples, programs to prevent the sexual transmission of HIV continue to be nonexistent or ineffective in most poor countries with major epidemics.<br>

<br>

Many Americans are unaware of how poorly the lessons of AIDS prevention have been implemented throughout the world. For example, less than half of the global blood supply is screened for HIV, condoms often are unavailable even to sex workers, and HIV-positive pregnant women are not identified or treated to prevent transmission of HIV to their babies.<br>

<br>

<SUBHED><FONT SIZE=+1>Marginalized people</FONT><br>

<br>

</SUBHED> While there is evidence that injection drug users desire to avoid HIV infection and are sometimes successful, too many countries have yet to implement realistic programs to help them. Too often, drug users are regarded as outcasts and principally viewed as a problem for the police rather than the health authorities.<br>

<br>

In many societies drug-using populations become sex workers or blood-plasma donors out of necessity to pay for their habits. In other countries, commercial sex, even when it is not linked to illicit drug use, has become a survival strategy and greatly amplifies the epidemic in the absence of effective prevention programs targeted to this special problem.<br>

<br>

Too frequently, political leaders have avoided addressing the especially desperate needs and problems of these marginalized people. Some countries have enlisted the help of private organizations to help implement AIDS prevention in difficult-to-reach populations.<br>

<br>

The mindset of some foundations, pharmaceutical firms, and government agencies is beginning to change. Many have come to the realization that there is a need for action and that controlling AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa and other low-resource countries will be a complex, expensive, and difficult undertaking that will need to be sustained for many years. It will be much more difficult than continuing efforts to bring tuberculosis under control or to eliminate smallpox and polio.<br>

<br>

Although HIV vaccines are in development, most scientists believe that an effective vaccine will not be available for at least five to 10 years. Even if an HIV vaccine is eventually developed, it is very unlikely it will be nearly as effective as the polio or measles vaccines. More likely, an HIV vaccine will provide partial and temporary immunity from infection. While this would be a major step forward, a vaccine for HIV is not likely to control the epidemic entirely in the same way that vaccines for polio, measles, and smallpox have done. Furthermore, the drugs used to treat HIV infections are not a cure. They only suppress the infection and must be continued for a lifetime.<br>

<br>

Despite all of the difficulties in attempting to control the AIDS pandemic, there is no alternative to mounting this urgent effort now. Given the severity of the pandemic, the endorsement of a coordinated prevention and treatment program by the United Nations is very appropriate. A well-conceived and comprehensive prevention and treatment effort in each of the severely affected countries is required. The United Nations estimates it could cost $7 billion to $10 billion per year.<br>

<br>

It will be insufficient to merely provide cheap or free drugs to treat those already infected. The infrastructure to identify infected individuals, to deliver the drugs, and to monitor the treated patients will be needed. Even more importantly, aggressive and innovative prevention efforts will be necessary. Likewise, free condoms with health education or other prevention programs that do not deal with the problems and needs of those already infected will be inadequate.<br>

<br>

<SUBHED><FONT SIZE=+1>Importance of treatment </FONT><br>

<br>

</SUBHED> Treatment and counseling of infected people is a critical part of the prevention agenda. Anti-retroviral treatment not only makes people feel better, it also reduces the risk of transmission. Eventually, an effective HIV vaccine will be critical to controlling the AIDS pandemic, but prevention efforts directed at marginalized populations, as well as the general public, will still be needed.<br>

<br>

Political leaders must be educated as well. In some developing countries, such as South Africa, there is an urgent need for the political leaders to get out of the way of people and organizations that could help. The refusal of governments in some developing countries to permit the importation of critical drugs or to prevent mother-to-child transmission of the virus is a major impediment to progress. It will be difficult to go forward without a change in the mindset of politicians in some countries. It will be necessary to promote screening for HIV and treatment for those infected, as well as to protect their rights and prevent discrimination and stigmatization.<br>

<br>

Justice Edwin Cameron of the High Court of South Africa eloquently summed up the challenge we face in battling the AIDS crisis during his speech at the 13th International Conference on AIDS last summer in Durban, South Africa. He highlighted the gap between the successful AIDS treatment and prevention programs in the developed Western countries and the lack of such efforts in most developing countries. Cameron told the gathered scientists and policy-makers that he was infected with HIV. Because of his high socioeconomic status, he was one of the few South Africans able to receive treatment and continue working.<br>

<br>

Cameron said this inequity in access to prevention and treatment presents a moral dilemma, stating: &quot;The world has become a single sphere, in which communication, finance, trade, and travel occur within a single entity. How we live our lives affects how others live theirs. We cannot wall off the plight of those whose lives are proximate to our own.&quot;<br>

<br>

We should applaud the efforts of the United Nations in leading the world in addressing this global health crisis. The task is difficult but the need to act now is urgent. AIDS is one of the most important human-rights, medical, and social issues of our time.
