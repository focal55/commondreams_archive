It has become increasingly fashionable

for our government officials and their friends to

promote Washington's global agenda as a

helping hand to the world's poor. "If one is

concerned about the developing countries, both

history and recent studies would suggest an

open system is going to be the formula for

them," said Bob Zoellick, US Trade

Representative at a recent press briefing.



<p>Even less partisan observers such as

Joseph S. Nye, Jr., Dean of Harvard's Kennedy

School, assert that globalization "has improved

the lot of hundreds of millions of poor people

around the world."



<p>But what if it just weren't true? Is it

possible that globalization has been a losing

proposition for most of the countries -- and

people -- of the world?



<p>It is generally considered heresy to even

ask such questions. Everyone who has managed

to stay awake through an introductory

economics course knows that the world is better

off when trade expands -- at least in theory.



<p>But the real world is often more

complex. Over the last 20 years most countries

have increasingly opened their economies to

international trade and investment. They have

also adopted -- under the theory that "Uncle

Sam knows best" --  a host of related economic

policies promoted by Washington-run

institutions such as the IMF and the World

Bank.



<p>The real world results look very bad. For

the vast majority of countries, the last two

decades have shown considerably -- and often

drastically -- slower growth than was seen in the

previous 20 years (1960-1980). And the poorer

countries have generally suffered the worst

declines in the growth of income per person, the

most basic indicator of economic progress.



<p>The exceptions tend to be countries like

China -- which has highly protected domestic

markets, extensive currency controls, and a

banking system dominated by state-owned

banks. This is not to say that any of these

policies would necessarily work elsewhere, or

that there are no gains to be had from

international trade and investment.



<p>But there is clearly something wrong

with the prevailing orthodoxy. Strategies for

economic development have been abandoned,

and it is generally assumed that open markets,

privatization, and attracting foreign investors

will do the job.



<p>The last 20 years of globalization have

also shown substantially diminished progress in

health outcomes, such as infant and child

mortality, and life expectancy. The same is true

for other social indicators, including education

and literacy. Again, the slowdown in progress is

worse among the lower-income countries.



<p>A world in which half of humanity

survives on less than $2 a day cannot afford to

postpone development for the sake of being

"economically correct," or for the special

interests of transnational corporations. The

expansion of trade and international markets is

not an end in itself, however much it may

appear that way to our corporate and political

leaders.



<p>The Bush Administration is now

urgently seeking "Trade Promotion Authority"

to negotiate a Free Trade Area of the Americas,

stretching from Canada to Argentina. This

would mean that Congress would have only an

up-or-down vote on the FTAA, with no

amendments.



<p>It's going to be a hard sell, with our

economy at a virtual standstill, and no recovery

yet in sight. During the economic expansion of

the 1990s, it was easier not to notice the

millions of jobs lost to expanding trade. Even

then, workers who lost their jobs in

manufacturing usually ended up working for

lower pay (if they were lucky enough to find a

job at all). But now the economy is not even

creating enough jobs to keep unemployment

from rising. In June, employment actually fell

even in the service sector, for the first time since

1958.



<p>Labor can be expected to fight Trade

Promotion Authority and the FTAA. They will

be joined by environmental and public interest

groups who oppose granting corporations new

rights -- as NAFTA did -- to sue governments

directly and overturn regulations designed to

protect the environment and public health.



<p>The opposition will be accused of

turning their backs on the world's poor. But the

last 20 years of corporate-led globalization tell a

different story: the world's poor need a New

Deal even more than we do. American labor and

citizens' groups should ignore these self-

righteous and self-serving accusations, and carry

on against the FTAA -- as well as the IMF,

World Bank, and World Trade Organization --

with a clear conscience. They are not only

protecting American jobs, wages, and natural

resources -- they are also saving the rest of the

world.
