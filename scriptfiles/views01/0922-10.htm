<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->The United States feels an imminent threat of biological or chemical

terrorist attack.  How do our own policies relate to the rise of this

frightening situation? Why has our government been throwing away so

many opportunities to work with other nations to control weapons of

mass destruction?  This paper, for the US peace movement and

non-profit activists, explains the key avoidable factors that have

led to this predicament, and suggests what US policy changes can be

made to help us find a peaceful way out.



<p>Shaken and angered by cruel terrorist attacks, the United States has

announced a war on terrorism. Although no legal declaration has been

made, US leaders are emphatic that they are not using the word in a

figurative sense.  This time, war really means war.  Our nation's

goals include not only capturing the attacks' perpetrators "dead or

alive" and ending state-sponsored terrorism (although none is yet

proven); but ridding the globe of the threat posed by terrorist use

of biological and chemical weapons.



<p>The latter is certainly a noble goal, although many thoughtful

citizens and peaceniks (including the author) oppose the US's

military methods. The killing power of biological and chemical

weapons is unfathomable.  There is no defense but to avoid it

happening in the first place. In 1983, the US Army estimated that one

thousand kilograms (2200 lbs.) of sarin nerve gas aerosolized over an

urban area on a clear, calm night would kill 3,000 - 8,000 people, an

attack in terms of human lives roughly proportionate to that on the

World Trade Center. One tenth of the amount of anthrax spores - one

hundred kilograms - distributed under similar conditions would be

likely to result in the death of one to three million people, an

unimaginable toll two hundred to six hundred times that in New York.



<p><b>Once Upon a Time

</b>

<p>There was a time when the US arguably could muster sufficient

credibility to lead a campaign to eliminate chemical and biological

weapons.  In 1973, President Nixon renounced biological weapons and

mostly dismembered the US bioweapons apparatus.  It wasn't an

altruistic move so much as a way to discourage poorer countries from

developing offensive biological warfare capabilities that could rival

nuclear weapons in killing power.  All without making a Manhattan

Project-sized investment in science and infrastructure.



<p>Not produced in large quantities for so long that many are actually

leaking their deadly contents, old stocks of chemical weapons began

to be incinerated at the end of the Cold War (the process continues

today).  Russian inspectors were even allowed to enter and examine US

facilities that they thought might be producing biological weapons.

The US ratified the Chemical Weapons Convention, and was in talks

with other nations to develop a UN system to verify global compliance

with the Biological Weapons Convention.



<p>In short, we were cooperative and did not seem to be threatening the

world with chemical and biological warfare.



<p><b>The Present

</b>

<p>Sadly, it is no longer the case that the US can lead the world

against chemical and biological weapons. Our leaders have sacrificed

our progress in bungled attempts to address policy problems of the

present.  The US may have the military muscle to stamp out the

current generation of active terrorists; but does not possess the

moral authority to spearhead a crusade against weapons of mass

destruction.  Certainly not nukes. Vice President Cheney refuses to

rule out dropping the bomb on terrorists.  Chemical and biological

weapons? Our actions and policy are even worse.



<p>There has always been a shadier side to the US renunciation of

chemical and biological weapons.  For example: Cuban accusations of

biological attack with agricultural pests (unproven; but stridently

alleged and not without evidence), enemies convinced that the US

maintains offensive biological weapons (incorrect as alleged; but

some biodefense research walks a razor-thin line), and refusal to

accept responsibility for the horrendous human and environmental

effects of Agent Orange, the latter most recently, shamefully

repeated by Bill Clinton in Hanoi itself.



<p>Some problems - like Agent Orange - are ongoing moral failures.

Others, as troubling as they are, remain unproven, pertain to events

dating from years ago, or were sufficiently ambiguous (at least in

terms of the public's knowledge), to shield the US from many critics.

For problems like the Cuban allegations, it will take years for the

truth to be known with certainty, if ever. They have damaged; but in

themselves did not destroy US ability to lead the struggle against

biological and chemical weapons. At least until now.



<p>The fact that the US maintains what is far and away the largest

biological weapons defense program in the world doesn't help either.

Even the greatest experts disagree on which specific activities are

offensive and which can be classified as defensive.  The tendency

among governments has been toward classifying all "research" (as

opposed to weapons-building and testing) as the latter.  The laxity

of interpretation has given rise to potential misunderstandings and

opened doors to would-be biological weapons developers.  Genetic

engineering and its proliferation has made matters worse, further

blurring the line between offensive and defense and giving rise to

the technical possibility to create genetically-engineered superbugs

and even entirely new classes of biological weapons.  The billions

recently authorized by Congress for homeland defense will swell this

opaque military-scientific-corporate biotechnology bureaucracy and

the instability it creates to even larger proportions.



<p><b>Demolishing Cooperation

</b>

<p>The demolition of international confidence in the US has come more

recently, and we have nobody but ourselves to blame. Bumbling

attempts to address several post-Cold War problems were allowed to so

completely convolute chemical and biological weapons control

commitments that we sacrificed whatever moral high ground we might

have had. Now, many international critics convincingly argue the US

is a chemical and biological weapons control "rogue state".



<p>Where did we go wrong?  Three main areas: First, fear of terrorism

and "rogue states" and, particularly, their access to the military

talent and technology of our Cold War enemies.  Second, missteps

retooling the US military for greater involvement in peacekeeping and

military "operations other than war" (such as Somalia).  Third, a

foolish attempt to find the ever-elusive "silver bullet" to win the

Drug War that has resulted in US development of biological weapons.

In more detail:



<p><b>Biological Warfare in the Name of America's Children

</b>

<p>For more than three years the US has menaced other countries with the

threat of biological attack. Not just any countries.  We've mainly

harassed two of the world's terrorism hotspots:  Afghanistan and

Colombia.



<p>The ostensible US motive is to prevent American kids from becoming

drug addicts by using biological weapons on Third World countries

that produce the drugs we buy and then snort, inject, and smoke.  In

Afghanistan the target is opium poppy, source of heroin.  Our weapon

is a dangerous fungus developed by a perverse alliance of

militaristic US drug warriors and ex-Soviet bioweapons researchers

who previously dedicated themselves to developing pathogens to

destroy US food supplies. The legal pretext includes attempts to gain

the "approval" of the Afghan government in exile (in Pakistan), a

bitter enemy of the Taliban that has no de facto power. The

environmental and human effects of use of these fungi could be

devastating.



<p>Our troops are a surprise.  This biological weapon is not in our

military arsenal; but that of the State Department's anti-narcotics

division, supported by US diplomatic missions (repeat: diplomatic

missions) that provide cash, political, and intelligence support.



<p>The US also supports using bioweapons in other conflict-torn

countries, such as Burma and Colombia, site of the largest armed

conflict in the Americas.  Colombia has no fewer than three terrorist

organizations as defined by the State Department, including FARC, one

of the world's largest terrorist groups and an organization that has

repeatedly killed Americans. It is a testament to the severity of the

conflict in Colombia that it has the second largest number of

war-displaced persons in the world (after Sudan).  Into this mix, the

US wants to throw biological weapons.



<p>(In case you were wondering, it was proposed here too - to eradicate

pot in Florida - but environmental officials immediately shot it

down.)



<p><b>Burning the Treaties to Save Them - Non-Lethal Weapons

</b>

<p>Mogadishu was a harrowing disaster for the US armed forces.  Sadly,

Somali civilians literally tore to pieces several US servicemen who

thought they were on a mission to help the poor and feed the hungry.

The military, understandably anxious to prevent a recurrence, vows it

will never happen again.  The Pentagon's solution, of course, is not

politics; but weapons.  Specifically, it started a huge program to

delve into new and controversial "non-lethal" weapons systems.

Non-lethal should not be understood as benign.  In fact, these are

powerful weapons designed not to prevent death or permanent injury;

only to lessen its frequency.



<p>Apart from microwaves to heat the skin, sound generators to vibrate

internal organs, lasers to confuse the eyes, and other non-chemical

and biological systems, the Joint Non-Lethal Weapons Program (JNLWP)

has entertained proposals to dose people, especially rioters and

"potentially hostile civilians", with drugs.  These drugs include

sedatives, "calmatives" (such as hallucinogens and ketamine, a DEA

schedule narcotic), muscle relaxants, opioids (the class of chemicals

in heroin), and "malodorants" (indescribably foul smelling

substances).  JNLWP has weighed genetically engineered microbes to

destroy enemy vehicles, machinery, and supplies.



<p>It isn't just blackboard and small-scale laboratory work.  The Navy

has a genetically modified microbe to destroy plastics and, in the

words of one researcher "There is almost nothing some bug won't eat."

Delivery mechanisms under consideration or development include

backpack sprayers, land mines, mortars, and payloads for unmanned

aerial vehicles. JNLWP has planned computer simulations of the

offensive use of calmative agents, contracted with a major US

military supplier to develop an overhead-exploding chemical riot

control mortar round, and field-tested new non-lethal weapons (but

not biological ones) on humans in Kosovo.



<p>The Pentagon claims - and desperately wants to hypnotize itself into

believing - that these arms are not chemical and biological weapons,

rather, that they are a potentially less bloody way to conduct

peacekeeping operations, isolate terrorists, and squelch civil

disobedience.  But it is exceedingly unlikely that people forcibly

gassed with mind-altering drugs will view the hijacking of their

brains and bodies as a humane act.  Much more probably, when their

motor control returns and hallucinations fade away, they may have

permanent psychological damage and feel enraged at the denial of

their freedom of thought and expression.



<p>These weapons are not a panacea for death at the hands of US

soldiers, they are cruel and unusual biological and chemical weapons

banned under international laws for arms control, those prohibiting

torture, and those for protection of Human Rights.  This is how the

world, and especially the victims, will understand and react to these

weapons if they are used.  US attempts to characterize them as

anything else are not only wrong; but run the terrible risk of

provoking a biological or chemical attack on the US and its allies.



<p><b>Blunders and Backsliding on the Bioweapons Convention

</b>

<p>As 2001 opened, biological weapons control was focused on the

completion of six years of negotiations to develop an inspection

system to verify global compliance with the Biological and Toxin

Weapons Convention, the main international law against biological

weapons.  The inspection system, called the Verification Protocol,

was designed to give teeth to this important international agreement

by, among other things, mandating declaration of biodefense research

and permitting the UN to inspect suspected bioweapons facilities.



<p>Signs early this year from the USA were ominous.  At a non-lethal

weapons meeting in Scotland, US military officers left arms control

experts slack jawed when they called for the renegotiation of the

bioweapons treaty to allow the US to produce and use anti-material

biological weapons like those being investigated by the Joint

Non-Lethal Weapons Program.



<p>Things only got worse, and Uncle Sam led the way.  In July,

bioweapons negotiators were set to meet and try to finalize the

verification agreement.  The day before the meeting opened, the US

press was so uninterested that a back pages New York Times headline

declared the meeting was taking place in London, more than 450 miles

away from the actual site in Geneva, Switzerland.



<p>Unfortunately, the US diplomatic team didn't divert to London and, as

expected arrived in Geneva and trashed the Verification Protocol. Six

years of negotiations were rendered at least temporarily useless, and

perhaps permanently. The US backed away just as other countries

approached agreement.  It was reminiscent - and close on the heels  -

of the US's withdrawal from the Kyoto agreement to control global

warming.  In this case not content to simply walk away, the US went a

big step further.  Adoption of the Verification Protocol needs

consensus.  The US said it will sit in the negotiations and kill the

Verification Protocol by deliberately blocking the efforts of others,

including the European Union.  The United States, standing alone,

delivered what may have been a knockout punch to the world's efforts

to combat biological weapons cooperatively.



<p><b>The CIA's Monstrous Mistake

</b>

<p>Not everybody at the New York Times had been asleep.  Although the

timing was unusual, in early September, a Times article made stunning

revelations about the US biodefense program. The US Central

Intelligence Agency (CIA) is conducting a secret program of

biodefense research that, in the opinion of many experts, violates

the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention.  The CIA tested mock

biological bombs and built a real bioweapons production facility in

Nevada.  If any other country conducted this research, it would have

drawn the US's harshest denunciations and, quite possibly, military

attack.  The real reasons for the US rejection of the Verification

Protocol suddenly became much more clear.



<p>The date of the New York Times story (September 4) was unusual

because persons close to the reporters' investigation, including US

officials, confirm that the Times was in possession of information

about the CIA's Nevada facility and bomb testing by May, 2001 - over

a month before the US trashed the Protocol.  Yet the Times waited to

enlighten the rest of the world until September, altering the course

of events in Geneva.  This has led to quiet accusations that instead

of printing the news when it was fit to be printed, the Times

withheld the information in order for its release to more closely

coincide with distribution of review copies of the journalists' new

book on the US biodefense program.  Or, some have suggested more

ominously, somebody at the Times may have placed protecting US

diplomatic interests ahead of journalistic ethics.



<p>It gets even worse.  Much worse.  The CIA's research activities were

not disclosed in annual declarations of biodefense activities to the

Bioweapons Convention.  Without actually mentioning it, the Times

article incontrovertibly demonstrated that the US had flouted a UN

mechanism to enhance transparency and trust between nations. The US

remained recalcitrant, claiming the CIA was "entirely appropriate,

necessary, consistent with US treaty obligations".  The diplomatic

significance of this is difficult to overstate. The most powerful

country in the world proved itself untrustworthy on biological

weapons research.  The CIA research has undermined faith in voluntary

confidence building measures to promote transparency between nations.

To US enemies, the CIA's work looks like nothing short of a

biological weapons threat and means that pious declarations about the

danger of bioweapons will ring hollow and be interpreted by US

enemies as lies - or even threats.



<p>The CIA activities not only threaten arms control; but may have

contributed to expanding the black market for bioweapons technology.

Part of the CIA effort involved (failed) attempts to buy and then

test small biological bombs ("bomblets") manufactured by the Soviet

Union in its final years.  According to University of Maryland expert

Milton Leitenberg:



<p>CIA operatives would have had to inform various networks of

essentially criminal elements -- smugglers and middlemen in Russia --

of what it was that the Agency was seeking. Those criminal networks

would then have tried to obtain the item.  If they did not succeed

this time, as was apparently the case, they have learned that it is a

sought-after commodity, and they may be motivated to continue that

effort on their own, understanding that there will be an interested

purchaser sometime later. The next time the interested buyer might

not be the US CIA. This duplicates the process that occurred in the

mid-1990s when covert operations by German intelligence agencies

[seeking] sellers of fissionable materials [i.e. fuel for

constructing nuclear weapons] in former East European nations

produced a flow of items of varying quality. When it was understood

that this program had stimulated individuals in Russia to find things

to sell, the operation was quickly shut down. Since these events

occurred only a half dozen years ago, one might have imagined that

the vaunted CIA might have remembered the lesson.



<p><b>The Bang of Big Buried Biological Bombs

</b>

<p>Next, in mid-September, Dr. Barbara Rosenburg of the Federation of

American Scientists dropped another (figurative) bomb detailing the

US's disregard for bioweapons control. Rosenburg found Department of

Energy documents stating that the US is planning (and might already

have begun) to test biological weapons loaded with live agents in two

large underground aerosol chambers at the Army's Edgewood Chemical

Biological Center in Maryland.  A similar facility is suspected to

exist for use by researchers pursuing similar aerosol projects at

Sandia National Laboratory in New Mexico.  Its precise location is

unknown.  Not by coincidence, Sandia is headquartered at Kirtland Air

Force Base near Albuquerque, a major research center for the Joint

Non-Lethal Weapons Program.



<p>To the initiated in the technical world of bioweapons research, the

kind of research planned is a big no-no.  It is of a scale

unnecessary for defensive research and apparently designed to yield

the exact kinds of data needed to build new biological weapons.



<p><b>Unfortunately Not the End

</b>

<p>Before the Twin Towers crashed to the ground, America's international

reputation on control of chemical and, especially, biological weapons

was punched full of holes and sinking fast.  Staunch allies are

appalled.  Before September 11th, UK officials made less than

complimentary remarks to the US press. Australia's Foreign Minster

upset Colin Powell's otherwise warm and cuddly kangaroo-hop Down

Under by blasting US rejection of bioweapons verification at a press

conference.  If the US's most obedient international lap dogs are

biting, it's hard to fathom what could be running through the mind of

leaders of many other political persuasions - Iran, Libya, Israel,

Sudan, Egypt, Iraq (all accused by the US of developing biological or

chemical weapons). Not to mention terrorists. A façade of cooperation

between most of these states has been achieved; but very deep

suspicions on weapons of mass destruction lurk just beneath the

surface and will come out, sooner or later.



<p>What happened in New York and Washington was truly terrible.  The

authors of the attacks and those that can be proven to have knowingly

assisted them should be tried in a court of law and face punishment.

But the war on terrorism isn't going to do anything good for

Americans' security from biological and chemical weapons attack.  To

the contrary, there are many things that may actually heighten the

risk, like spraying pathogenic fungus on Colombia, gassing people who

disagree with us with inhumane chemical weapons, or continuing to

flout international commitments on biological weapons.



<p>After thinking about the victims, it's also useful to think about

Mohammed Atta, who is alleged to have flown the first plane into the

World Trade Center. If what the FBI says is true, Atta was nothing

like the stereotyped "Arab terrorist".  Atta reportedly was a

disenchanted urban planning student alienated during his time in

Hamburg, Germany. He smoked, drank and, supposedly, enjoyed video

games.  He raised no suspicion in the US because he knew how to fit

in. More so than many isolated Americans, Atta was a product of

globalization and knew both sides of rich and poor, powerful and

passive.  He also knew from whence so many unpopular; but

global-imposed economic and social policies come, and whose will

prevails when they are at issue. Which might explain why he didn't

fly an Airbus into the Brandenburg Gate, or even the Frankfurt Stock

Exchange.



<p>Which isn't the slightest justification for his alleged actions.  But

don't be fooled for a minute into thinking that waging war against

terrorism will do anything to improve the long-term prospects of

avoiding the use of biological and chemical weapons.  Key elements of

the solution to those problems lie inside our own institutions.
