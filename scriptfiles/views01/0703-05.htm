Rio de Janeiro --

MILITARY helicopters buzzed noisily over the police-lined streets in Rio 

de Janeiro last month as tens of thousands of onlookers jostled and craned for 

a better view. The Brazilian army stood at attention as a bulldozer steamed 

through a cheering crowd.

<P>Crushed under the machine's immense weight were 100,000 guns confiscated by 

Rio police -- the largest arms stockpile ever destroyed anywhere in the world 

on a single day. The previous record number of guns had been 28,000 in South 

Africa.

<P>The event, organized by the Rio de Janeiro state government and Viva Rio, a 

local disarmament group, had all the markings of the polished public-image 

campaign: politicians made speeches, the national anthem crackled, and after 

the guns were all run over, police handed out white roses.

<P>For some, though, the polish was laid on a bit too thick. As a little girl 

solemnly set a single flower on the carpet of broken weapons, one American 

correspondent said loudly: "This whole thing is just a horse-and-pony show. A 

nice photo-op, but there's no story here."

<P>Rio is a city whose international image has in recent years swung from a 

hot beach paradise to a hotbed of violent crime. City police are notoriously 

violent and inefficient, and studies show that reselling confiscated guns in 

illegal markets is a widespread practice.

<P>Critics called the weapons "rusty old relics," that were only destroyed 

because they would have fetched little or no kickbacks -- even in the gun-

infested shantytowns, or favelas.

<P>True, some of the guns heaped onto the photogenic 4,304-square-foot pile 

were rusty and old. But if even one of those guns was destroyed instead of 

left inside someone's closet where it might be accidentally fired by a child, 

or used to irreversibly end a drunken argument, then the event was more than a 

publicity stunt.

<P>Furthermore, an analysis by the Institute of Religious Studies, a think-

tank in Rio, determined that nearly 600 of the destroyed weapons were machine 

guns, submachine guns and sawed-off shotguns. Also destroyed were grenade 

launchers, rocket launchers and bazookas. That's a far cry from rusty old 

relics -- by any standards.

<P>The latest U.N. statistics show that firearms are involved in more than 80 

percent of all homicides in Brazil, as well as the majority of its exceedingly 

high numbers of robbery and kidnapping.

<P>Much of Brazil's notorious violence problem then is made possible by guns, 

exacerbated by easy access in thriving illegal markets. Destroying confiscated 

weapons is the one sure way to ensure that they cannot trickle back into the 

hands of criminals.

<P>Critics most likely know nothing about the decades of bureaucratic 

disorganization that had to be undone to make the destruction event possible.

<P>First, police had to modernize their records, listing each gun in a 

computer database. Then, legislation was changed to allow the destruction of 

confiscated arms after five years instead of 20, as originally demanded by the 

Justice Department.

<P>This meant that no gun could have accumulated less than five years of wear 

and tear. And as the report noted, the use of larger and flashier weapons has 

been on the increase only in recent years, and "therefore constitute a large 

number of weapons still to be destroyed."

<P>Perhaps the mere presence of government officials, widely mistrusted as 

corrupt and self-serving throughout Brazil, led to skepticism.

<P>At the national level, legislation to permanently ban the sale of firearms 

to civilians has been stalled in congress for more than two years, rewritten 

so many times it retains little of its original stringency. In that time, more 

than 60,000 Brazilians have died as a result of firearm injuries, while a well-

funded gun lobby continues to gain power.

<P>But the Rio state government has, at least ostensibly, supported civil 

society disarmament efforts spearheaded by groups such as Viva Rio.

<P>Rio Vice Gov. Benedita da Silva, one of the first black women in Brazil to 

hold such high office, even took part in the march.

<P>"Combatting violence is one of the most urgent items on our agenda," she 

said, adding without a hint of irony that "we are not going to let this issue 

die."
