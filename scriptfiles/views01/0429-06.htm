Why is Los Angeles an island of tranquillity in the electric-power

crisis that has rocked California and threatens to spread across the

nation?

<p>News stories have repeatedly told us that the city's ownership and

operation of its own generating stations is the principal reason. By

staying clear of the state's 1996 deregulation scheme for private

utilities, the Department of Water and Power was able to hold onto its

power plants.

<p>So far, so good. But when we ask how Los Angeles came to enjoy public

power in the first place, the answer commonly given makes a hash of

history.

<p>Most historians and political scientists credit the city's progressive

reform movement of 1890-1915 for having wisely settled on a municipal

utility. True, some of the entrepreneurs, lawyers and reform-minded

professionals who called themselves "the best men" during that era

agitated for the city-built Owens Valley aqueduct and its generating

stations. But many reformers opposed the city's effort to distribute its

own power. Because they had allied themselves with railway magnate Henry

Huntington, who owned an electric company, or because they favored

regulation over municipal ownership, they wanted L.A.'s three private

electric companies to sell and profit from aqueduct power. Meyer Lissner,

a reform attorney often portrayed as a champion of public power, opposed

the holding of a decisive 1911 citywide straw poll on the subject because

he knew most Angelenos would cast their ballots for municipal ownership.

That, he said, would be "unfair" to the three utilities.

<p>The most steadfast partisans of public power were not progressive

reformers like Lissner but the city's much-maligned labor unions, and for

a simple reason. While mistrust of oligopoly ran through nearly all

sectors of society, it burned hottest in working-class wards. Without

organized labor's dogged campaign for "gas and water socialism," as well

as its willingness to hand control of these resources to the anti-union

regimes of Mayors George Alexander and Henry Rose, there would be no DWP

today.

<p>Organized labor played a key role in the city's original decision to

municipalize its water distribution system. On Oct. 24, 1892, 700 union

members met to demand that the city build a small neighborhood waterworks

as a step toward public control of the entire water supply. From that day

on, L.A.'s unions never wavered in their call for a public water supply

publicly managed. They mobilized the rank and file for the water-company

buyouts of 1901-04, and, in 1906, the Public Ownership Party's citywide

campaign primed voters to pour $23 million into construction of the Owens

River aqueduct a year later. The aqueduct was the sine qua non of public

power. At a time when most progressive reformers were mute on the

subject, organized labor insisted that the aqueduct be used to generate

electricity for the city's streets, homes and businesses.

<p>A broad consensus backed the city's construction of hydroelectric

plants while the aqueduct was being built, but most of the city's

politicians and corporate lobbyists were committed to public subsidies,

not public ownership, of aqueduct power. The 1911 straw poll, in which

city voters declared their support for municipal ownership and

distribution of Owens River power, upset their plans.

<p>The most consistent fighters for public power during the decades after

the straw poll were the Central Labor Council, International Brotherhood

of Electrical Workers, other unions and city employees who stuffed

campaign envelopes, canvassed precincts and got out the vote. Voters who

favored municipally owned power and initiatives bolstering the DWP tended

to be working class and Democratic; those opposed were mainly middle and

upper class and Republican.

<p>In this polarized political climate, Mayor Alexander called for a

$6.5-million bond issue to complete the aqueduct-power distribution

network; he left open the question of who would sell the power to

consumers. Unions and socialists tied their support for the bonds to a

city charter reform that would guarantee them a long-sought role in city

government through proportional representation. When the reform failed at

the polls, they withheld support from the power bonds, and these, too,

went down to defeat in 1913. Much of the rancor workers felt was aimed at

progressives like Lissner, head of the Good Government Organization, who

fought labor's charter plank because it would bring socialists onto the

City Council.

<p>The labor movement's dedication to public ownership soon reasserted

itself, however. With a citywide election coming up that June, five

unionists seeking council seats on the Socialist Party ticket revived

labor's long-standing demand for city operation of all public utilities

at cost. They urged the City Council to hold a new power-bond election

with a clear public ownership mandate. They attacked the power companies'

efforts to buy aqueduct power from the city and sell it to Angelenos at a

profit. Soon, the great majority of unions in the Central Labor Council

were locked in what turned out to be a decisive struggle against the

power oligopoly made up of Southern California Edison, Pacific Light &

Power and Los Angeles Gas & Electric.

<p>An unprecedented event brightened the bonds' chances. A machinist,

Fred C. Wheeler, won a seat on the City Council, the first unionist to do

so in the 20th century. Wheeler led a successful fight against an attempt

to split the power-bond issue into two separate ballot propositions, one

to complete the aqueduct's generating stations, the other to create a

city-owned distribution system. Such a division would probably have

doomed public power.

<p>The large majority of unionists who favored public power had little

time to savor Wheeler's victory. While pressing the attack on the three

electric companies, they faced a small but angry split in their own

ranks. Dissenters in the Building Trades Council and a few of its unions

argued that labor's grievances against the progressive regimes of 1909-14

had turned the argument for municipal ownership on its head. What good

was municipal ownership in the hands of a council and mayor who had

caused the arrest of hundreds of peaceful picketers during the citywide

strikes of 1910, had underpaid aqueduct workers and fed them bad food and

had denied unionists influential city jobs? The final blow was the

council's rebuff of a petition signed by thousands of workers for a

"living wage" law. Was it not folly to reward labor's foes with control

of the aqueduct's power?

<p>Union activists who favored the bonds conceded that the dissenters

were correct in their assessment of "progressive" city government. But

the progressive star was fading. What counted in the long run was whether

Los Angeles could wrest the city's electric power system from the grasp

of private utilities. The Central Labor Council's unions took this

challenge to heart and voted, 60-4, for a resolution favoring the bonds.

<p>On its own, as well as in coalition with other groups, the labor

movement marshaled its rank and file on behalf of public power. It turned

out hundreds of poll-watchers and canvassers on election day. The

pro-bond unions never did win over the dissenting faction; rather, they

overwhelmed it at the polls. On May 8, 1914, L.A.'s voters emphatically

endorsed the power bonds by a hefty 71%-29%, with the city's

working-class wards providing by far the largest margin of victory.

<p>Within a year, Los Angeles sold its bonds and began buying out the

three investor-owned utilities. The first public power flowed into local

homes and businesses in 1916. Two decades later, the DWP eliminated the

last of its private competition and consolidated the working-class legacy

of kilowatt and water socialism that has served the city so well in the

current energy crisis.
