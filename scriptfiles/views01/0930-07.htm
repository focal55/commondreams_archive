AS POLITICAL satires go, it is a dark and brutal one that begins on a 

deceptively positive note:

<P>"It was a time of great excitement. The country was up in arms, the war was 

on, in every breast burned the holy fire of patriotism . . ."

<P>The place was the United States, the time, 1904-1905, and the author was 

Samuel Clemens, by then known around the world as "Mark Twain." In what has 

come to be known as "The War Prayer," Clemens draws his unsuspecting reader in 

with a rousing account of a nation passionately headed off to war.

<P>"Sunday morning came . . . the church was filled . . . With the volunteers 

sat their dear ones, proud, happy, and envied by the neighbors and friends who 

had no sons and brothers to send forth to the field of honor, there to win for 

the flag or failing, die the noblest of noble deaths."

<P>Led by a pastor, Clemens' imagined congregation prays to "an ever-merciful 

and benignant Father of us all" to watch, aid, comfort, bless and shield "our 

noble young soldiers" and make them "strong and confident, invincible in the 

bloody onset; help them to crush the foe, grant to them and to their flag and 

country imperishable honor and glory."

<P>Then, Clemens eviscerates his reader with what he later told a friend was 

"the whole truth." In the person of a messenger from God, "an aged stranger . . . his long body clothed in a robe that reached to his feet . . . his seamy 

face unnaturally pale, pale even to ghastliness," the total reality of the 

people's prayers for victory is revealed.

<P>It is a reality few of us ever face, let alone accept.

<P>"Listen!" the stranger commands. ". . . O Lord our God, help us to tear 

their soldiers to bloody shreds with our shells; help us to cover their 

smiling fields with the pale forms of their patriot dead; help us to drown the 

thunder of the guns with the shrieks of their wounded, writhing in pain;

<P>"Help us to lay waste their humble homes with a hurricane of fire; help us 

to wring the hearts of their unoffending widows with unavailing grief; help us 

to turn them out roofless with their little children to wander unfriended the 

wastes of their desolated land in rags and hunger and thirst, sports of the 

sun flames of summer and the icy winds of winter, broken in spirit, worn with 

travail, imploring Thee for the refuge of the grave and denied it;

<P>"For our sakes who adore Thee, Lord, blast their hopes, blight their lives, 

protract their bitter pilgrimage, make heavy their steps, water their way with 

their tears, stain the white snow with the blood of their wounded feet!"

<P>The messenger finishes by asking for all of this "in the spirit of love of 

Him Who is the Source of Love, and Who is the ever-faithful refuge and friend 

of all that are sore beset and seek His aid with humble and contrite hearts. 

Amen."

<P>Driving the final nail of irony, Clemens closes the grim parable with the 

messenger demanding to know whether the congregation still desires its prayers 

to be answered. But no one speaks. The last sentence of the story explains:

<P>"It was believed afterward that the man was a lunatic, because there was no 

sense in what he said."

<P>Accustomed to criticism despite his literary success, Clemens insisted on 

keeping "The War Prayer" unpublished until after his death. As his first 

biographer, Albert Bigelow Paine, noted in 1912, Clemens confided his 

reasoning to a friend:

<P>"Only dead men can tell the truth in this world."

<P>In the century since it was written, "The War Prayer" has been invoked by 

pacifists during several conflicts in which the U.S. has engaged. Its last 

major renaissance was the Vietnam War.

<P>With the memory of that landscape and those people -- with the vision of 

millions of besieged Afghan women, children and men -- this seems as good a 

time as any for yet another reading.
