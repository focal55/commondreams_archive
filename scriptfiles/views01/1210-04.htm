I RECENTLY participated in a debate at the Harvard Medical School on the ethics of stem cell cloning. A co-panelist was Dr. Michael West, a Massachusetts biotech executive. His announcement a week earlier of a supposed breakthrough in human cloning nearly stampeded the Senate into banning cloning even for therapeutic purposes.

<P>





<P>There are indeed many ethical issues here,  but the religious right has so thoroughly hijacked the  conversation that the knotty scientific and ethical questions get sidetracked. On the issue of stem cell research, the gap between the scientific and  religious cultures has never been wider.</P>

<P>West tried to reassure several right-to-lifers in the Harvard audience by respectfully engaging them on their own terms. He explained that the early embryonic cells that his laboratory  tries to turn into specialized tissue for therapeutic  purposes hadn't even ''individuated'' yet. He even  tried recourse to scripture.  But you can't debate facts, much less  scripture, with someone whose knowledge is  absolute. One clergyman in the audience faulted the  scientists at the table for a lack of humility and for relying on ''a liturgy'' that leaves out theological knowledge. A liturgy! Liturgy is a religious concept, not a scientific one. It's the religious absolutists, whether in Cambridge or Kabul, who  could learn humility from scientists.</P>

<P>The right-to-life lobby knows as God's revealed truth that human life  begins at conception. By contrast, scientists begin with the premise that all  hypotheses are subject to empirical testing and  experimental falsification.</P>

<P>Skepticism (and humility) form the  essence of the scientific method. Revealed religious truth, on the other hand, may be subject to theological disputation but rarely to empirical falsification (except perhaps when a relic proves  bogus or a miracle fraudulent). The potential of stem cell research to  enhance human life is extraordinary. Within a few  years, unless the religious right manages to stop it,  specialized cells developed from either embryonic  or adult cells will be used therapeutically to treat  everything from Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, diabetes,  spinal injuries, heriditary impairments, and even the  regeneration of diseased organs. What could be  more ''prolife''?</P>

<P>At the same time, there are indeed myriad ethical questions raised by the effort to develop therapeutic applications of stem cell cloning. And none of them is theological issue of when life begins.</P>

<P>Among the real and knotty ethical questions are these: Should human embryos be created expressly to be used for stem cell extraction? (At present, laboratories generally use surplus embryos from in vitro fertilization efforts.)</P>

<P>Should women be paid to donate eggs or fertilized embryos to stem cell labs? Or should sale of embryos be banned just as most organ sales are  banned in the United States?</P>

<P>Should expensive therapies derived from  stem cell research be covered universally by health insurance? Should some applications be considered therapeutic and others cosmetic? Or should all of these therapies be just for the rich?</P>

<P>Should a whole human being ever be cloned?  What about the hard cases - an infertile couple  suffering the death of a 2-year-old? What about gay men who desire children?</P>

<P>How much of the basic science should be patented and considered proprietary commercial  knowledge, and how much should be publicly  funded and kept in the public domain? Skeptics of   West's breakthrough announcement viewed it  as aimed more at Wall Street analysts than at the  scientific community.</P>

<P>President Bush took a stab at setting ethical  guidelines last August. This was the last major  controversy before Sept. 11 blew everything  else off the front pages.</P>

<P>Bush's guidelines make no sense whatever except when understood as an attempt to  accommodate right-to-lifers without looking totally antiscience. He decreed that stem cell colonies  produced before Aug. 9, 2001, could continue to  receive federal funding for research purposes but no federal money could go to develop new stem cells from embryos. Private money, oddly, could continue to finance such work.</P>

<P>The only conceivable logic of this position is  that previously ''murdered'' embryos cannot be brought back to life and might as well be used  therapeutically but that policy should discourage  future ''murders.'' Yet the president's decision allows private entrepreneurs to make the major scientific and ethical decisions, which leads to inconsistent public policy and fragments the  science.  In other words, administration policy is a bizarre twin sop to right-to-lifers and biotech entrepreneurs.</P>

<P>The life-enhancing promise of stem cell research is just too potent and the ethical questions  too tricky to leave the issue in the hands either of  private entrepreneurs or religious fundamentalists,  much less both.</P>
