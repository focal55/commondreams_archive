As President Jean-Bertrand Aristide takes the

reins of power in Haiti for the third time in ten years, a

debate over his presidency is taking place in US foreign

policy circles and the press. The discussion centers

around whether Aristide is "fully committed to

democracy," and of course, "economic reforms." But an

honest look at the last decade of US relations with Haiti

raises very different, and much more troubling questions.



         <p>Aristide began his last term as President ten years

ago, after winning a landslide victory despite

Washington's disapproval and financing of opposing

candidates. A populist priest who was one of the

country's leading advocates for the poor, he served less

than 8 months before being overthrown in a bloody

military coup.



         <p>The coup leader, Lt. General Raul Cedras, was on

the payroll of the US Central Intelligence Agency. Time

magazine reported that the CIA had advance knowledge

of the coup, but took no steps to prevent it-- indicating at

least tacit US support for the coup, and given the

circumstances, probably much more than that.



         <p>Thousands of Aristide's supporters took to the

streets to defend their first democratically elected

government. They were unarmed, and hundreds were

slaughtered mercilessly by the military and police. In the

ensuing years the dictatorship killed thousands of

political opponents, setting up a special death-squad

organization-- known by its initials in French as

F.R.A.P.H. The founder and leader of this organization,

Emmanuel Constant, was also a CIA operative.



         <p>The Clinton administration inherited the problem

from George Bush Senior, and mostly ignored Haiti for

more than a year. It then began -- as a result of political

pressure and the flood of Haitian refugees headed to

Florida's shores-- to pressure the military dictatorship to

step down.



         <p>This led eventually to US troops invading Haiti in

the fall of 1994. Most Americans know only of this action

to restore the elected government, and not the prior

measures to destroy it. They therefore have an inverted--

even Orwellian-- image of our role in Haiti. Moreover,

the objectives of the Clinton administration were less

than democratic: the plan at the time was to leave the

army and repressive apparatus in place, removing only

the top three officers.



         <p>This plan began to fall apart after Haitian soldiers

beat an innocent man to death in front of international TV

cameras. US troops stood by under orders not to

intervene, and they expressed their disgust and frustration

openly to the press. President Clinton found himself in a

bind: to drum up support for the invasion he had

described the Haitian military as "murderers, rapists, and

thugs." Less than a week later he was calling these same

people "our allies."



         <p>Aristide took advantage of the situation to

dismantle the military, as well as the violent "section

chief" system of repression of in the countryside. In doing

so he created the foundation for the first democratic

government in the history of the nation, which had lived

for thirty years under the US-supported Duvalier family

dictatorship until 1986. For the first time people could

hold meetings and form political organizations without

fear of being killed.



         <p>But there was little that he could do about Haiti's

economy: that was in the hands of the IMF, the World

Bank, and their patrons in Washington. These people had

a simple economic development plan for Haiti: produce

coffee, mangos, some other agro-exports, and build up

the light assembly export sector. Privatize public utilities.

Cut tariffs on imports.



         <p>But the light assembly (read: sweatshop) sector

provided few jobs, and at very low pay-- less than $2.00 a

day. With 84% of the inputs imported, the contribution of

this sector to the domestic economy was tiny.



         <p>The lowering of tariffs on imported rice sunk

thousands of domestic farmers, who could not compete

with subsidized (and mechanized) US production.

Privatization of the telephone company was seen as

highly questionable, given its enormous revenues (3

percent of GDP), the government's difficulty in collecting

taxes from other sources, and the lack of adequate

regulatory structures.



         <p>For these and other valid reasons, Haiti's

government and especially its parliament rejected much

of the IMF/ World Bank plan. Standoffs with

Washington-- which controls both aid and credit--

damaged Haiti's economy and contributed to political

instability, while the aid that was actually disbursed had

little positive impact.



         <p>Now Washington is once again withholding aid to

Haiti, based on disputed senate election results and other

concerns. Aristide has offered to rerun the 10 challenged

senate elections of last November, and conceded to other

demands that were put forth by the Clinton

administration.



         <p>Haiti certainly has its own political and economic

problems, and Aristide has his faults. But the foremost

obstacle to democracy and economic recovery in Haiti

remains, as it has been for many years, "that cold country

to the North." Those who now sit in Washington in

judgment of Haiti's government, threatening the country

with economic strangulation and perhaps even another

coup, should consider these words: judge not lest ye be

judged.
