THE SEPT. 11 attacks in New York and Washington require our country to respond assertively and effectively against international terrorism.  As airstrikes pound terrorist sites inside Afghanistan, the administration must take urgent steps now to address the humanitarian crisis there.

<P>



<p>Even before the world focused on it as a sanctuary for Osama bin Laden and other terrorists, Afghanistan was on the brink of a humanitarian catastrophe, the site of the greatest crisis in hunger and refugee displacement in the world. Now the worsening situation on the ground is almost unimaginable. After four years of relentless drought and the total failure of the Taliban in administering the country, four million people have abandoned their homes in search of food in Pakistan, Iran, and elsewhere, while those left behind eat meals of locusts and animal fodder. Some 7.5 million people inside the country are threatened by famine or severe hunger as cold weather approaches. <P>







<p>As President Bush made clear, we are waging a campaign against terrorists, not ordinary Afghans, who are some of the poorest and most beleaguered people on the planet and were our allies during the Cold War. The administration's  military actions must thus be targeted against those responsible for the attacks and those harboring them; planned to minimize the danger to innocent civilians on the edge of starvation; and prepared to address any humanitarian consequences immediately.<P>







<p>Since it seems clear that a major international refugee influx will require a massive expansion of existing  camps and creation of new ones, the United States and our UN Security Council allies should also be thinking  about how to protect those camps, including possibly using a UN-sanctioned  military force drawn primarily from Arab nations.<P>







<p>Osama bin Laden is not a native of Afghanistan, but of Saudi Arabia. Most Afghans do not support bin Laden.  Ninety percent of the Afghan people  are subsistence farmers struggling simply to grow food to stay alive. War  widows, orphans, and thousands of others in the cities are dependent upon  international aid to survive.<P>







<p>Now, fearing the effects of the military attacks and forcible conscription by the Taliban, almost a million Afghan civilians are on the move, fleeing the cities for their native villages or for the borders. According to the UN, nearly 20,000 have gathered at one Pakistani border crossing alone. The UN says that it is the most tense border point in the world, with thousands of people exposed to scorching days and frigid nights.  Kandahar, the spiritual seat of the Taliban, is said to be half empty. Those left behind are the most vulnerable - the elderly, orphans, war widows, and the disabled.<P>







<p>Inside Afghanistan, the UN's World Food Programme aid - much of it US-donated wheat - was the sole source of food for millions. The program  announced Monday that it was stopping all food shipments to Afghanistan, citing the danger the fighting posed to its truck convoys. Our first  priority  must be to enhance security for the  convoys to get food immediately to the maximum number of people. To get needed aid in and slow the outflow of Afghan refugees driven by a lack of food at home, the Pakistani government should relax its border restrictions enough to allow the  flow of food and other aid into Afghanistan, while maintaining border security.<P>







<p>There is no easy solution to this  crisis, and yet our government must aggressively seek solutions to the critical needs of Afghan civilians. As one of its most urgent tasks, the United States must do its part to shore up relief operations and help to get aid flowing. <P>







<p>Air drops of food are not enough, and will not necessarily reach those in need. We also must prepare for an already critical situation to worsen as Afghanistan heads into its notoriously harsh winter. We must prepare for huge numbers of  refugees and humanitarian problems in the aftermath of military strikes, prepositioning in the region the people and resources needed to deal with  them.<P>







<p>The UN and several privately funded aid groups are working frantically to set up new camps and bring in supplies and personnel to sites along the border. And  yet, developing a stronger response to a massive outflow of Afghans into Pakistan is sure to put pressure on already over-burdened camps, and by extension Pakistani resources and patience.  Pakistan is already host to over a  million refugees from Afghanistan; 170,000 came as a result of recent drought;  others fled earlier and have been in Pakistan for years.<P>







<p>While President Bush pledged $320 million, the need is immense. The United Nations has said that $584 million will be needed to assist 7.5 million Afghans from now until the winter snows melt. We have agreed to participate in efforts to raise more funds. The United States and its allies must lead this  effort, especially now as they seek to build a coalition of moderate Arab and non-Arab Muslims for our antiterror efforts.<P>







<p>If a humanitarian catastrophe is attributed to our military operations, it could pull apart our international coalition to fight terrorism, radicalize more people who might be sympathetic to the terrorists' views,  and may even make the American people more vulnerable in the end.<P>
