Many Americans have seen the digital dream of global 

communications vividly expressed on TV commercials for Cisco Systems. Eager 

to promote its theme of "empowering the Internet generation," the giant 

high-tech firm paid for a lot of lovely ads with adorable children from 

different countries asking: "Are you ready?"



<p>By now, we understand that our response is supposed to be -- must 

be -- affirmative. But our best answer may be a question: "Ready for what?"



<p>History tells cautionary tales. After the first rudimentary 

telegraph went into operation 207 years ago in Europe, media analyst Armand 

Mattelart says, "long-distance communication technology was promoted as a 

guarantee of the revival of democracy." During the next several decades, a 

powerful concept took hold -- "the ideology of redemption through networks."



<p>In his book "Networking the World, 1794-2000," Mattelart points to 

assumptions that have spanned continents and centuries. "Each technological 

generation provided a new opportunity to propagate the grand narratives of 

general concord and social reconciliation under the aegis of Western 

civilization." Whether the instruments of unprecedented change were 

railroads, undersea cables or electric patents, promoters spoke of wondrous 

horizons. But the gaps were huge between "promises for a better world due 

to technology" and "the reality of struggles for control of communication 

devices." Elites routinely won those struggles.



<p>In our own time, technology has often appeared to offer the means 

for global solutions. "At the end of the 1970s, the nation-state was being 

attacked on two fronts: it was accused of being too large to solve small 

problems of human existence and too small to solve big ones.... As a way 

out of this dual impasse, information and communication networks had become 

the panacea."



<p>But hucksterism kept tightening its grip: "Advertising, which 

initially seemed little more than a modernized sales technique, gradually 

became the vector of the commercialization of the entire mode of 

communication and, as such, a key feature of the public sphere," Mattelart 

writes. These days, it's a facile corporate feat to conflate democratic 

decision-making with global shopping. "The advertising industry strives to 

construct vast transnational communities of consumers who all share the 

same 'socio-styles,' forms of consumption, and cultural practices."



<p>Today, we hear the latest versions of what Mattelart calls 

"messianic discourses about the democratic virtues of technology." Serving 

as smoke screens for inordinate privilege and consolidated power, such 

rhetorical exercises commonly tout "globalization" -- corporate 

globalization -- as an obvious common-sense way of stimulating prosperity 

and encouraging democracy. "The idea has taken root in free trade rhetoric 

that the spread of products of the entertainment industry automatically 

leads to civil and political freedom, as if the status of the consumer were 

equivalent to that of the citizen."



<p>Mattelart notes "the rapidity with which Asian and Latin American 

countries have adapted to digital technology and the advantage they have 

taken of it." But there's a grim flip side. "We cannot deny, however, that 

these new sources of modernity coexist -- as the second side of the coin -- 

with a galloping process of impoverishment and exclusion of large sections 

of the population."



<p>Translated from French and published in the United States last 

year, Mattelart's book challenges the prevalent, cloying hype about 

Internet globalism. The Paris-based scholar is on target: "Only a 

mediacentric view of society can delude people into believing that a 

planetary perspective can be reduced to being exposed to foreign brands and 

trans-boundary information, programs and servers. Connection with the world 

is also, and above all, a matter of experience."



<p>But authentic experience is far from the synthetic variety 

supplied by most global media, flowing through certain ruts that we're 

encouraged to mistake for life itself. "Systems for structuring meaning 

through digitization of knowledge underlie a specific geocultural model," 

Mattelart observes. "The risk is that it may impose as a criterion of 

universality a particular mode of thinking and feeling..." At the same 

time, in effect, New Mediaspeak often equates the universal with the 

marketable.



<p>Yet communication from the grassroots, connecting people 

internationally as they strive for free expression and social justice, 

remains a much sought-after goal. Some excellent work is moving in that 

direction. For instance, an innovative website that recently marked its 

first anniversary -- <a href="http://www.MediaChannel.org">www.MediaChannel.org</a> -- is a steady fount of news, 

reports, resources and opinion, "featuring content from over 600 

media-issues groups worldwide." Founded a few months earlier, the globally 

oriented Independent Media Center -- <a href="http://www.indymedia.org">www.indymedia.org</a> -- is a wide-ranging 

entryway to progressive media activism on several continents.



<p>Such creative endeavors are in stark contrast to the products of 

multimedia conglomerates. It's shrewd to spew out humanistic platitudes 

while pursuing rapacious quests for global market share. "Soon, all our 

ideas will be free of borders," a Cisco Systems commercial declares. "Are 

you ready?"
