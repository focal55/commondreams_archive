            <p> Those images of protesters clad in black with their faces hidden 

              behind scarves and hoods as they stormed police lines in Genoa make 

              it tempting to dismiss their opposition to globalization as stemming 

              from anger, not reflection. 

            <P> The name of their rallying cry doesn&#39;t help either. Anarchism 

              sounds too much like a synonym for the chaos and confusion they 

              recently brought to the streets of Italy and to previous economic 

              summits in Seattle, Washington, Melbourne, Prague and Quebec City. 

              Yet it would be foolish to write off those young militants as inspired 

              by nothing more profound than "Easy Rider" or some other version 

              of the Hells Angels&#39; philosophy of life. </p>

            <P> The anarchist movement has a long history and a perfectly coherent 

              ideology. </p>

            <P> It is not likely to go away anytime soon. It is more likely due 

              for a renaissance. Arguably, it is tailor-made for the increasing 

              numbers of people who feel alienated by the incessant absorption 

              of all the Earth&#39;s societies and local cultures into a brave, 

              new, one world of free trade and Golden Arches. </p>

            <P> That last mouthful may sound a bit mystical. But anarchism can 

              be easily understood by considering a kind of work-a-day experience 

              many of us share. </p>

            <P> For instance, as a teen-ager I worked in a florist shop. The owner 

              was a hail-and-well-met fellow, overflowing with enthusiasm and 

              possessing a booming voice to match. Every morning, he would take 

              a look at our stack of orders for prom corsages and funeral wreaths 

              and announce the obvious: "Boys, we&#39;ve got our work cut out 

              for us today." Then he would dart from one workstation to another, 

              pulling a gladiola out of one centerpiece, impulsively sticking 

              an extra carnation into another and generally getting in the way. 

            </p>

            <P> He had a real talent for that, not being a florist himself but 

              having come to the business from a totally different walk of life. 

              From the standpoint of us worker bees, he was a burden we had to 

              bear until the daily relief from that part of our toil. By 11 o&#39;clock, 

              he would generally get a phone call from a buddy inviting him to 

              lunch, a game of cards, or maybe an afternoon at the racetrack. 

            </p>

            <P> Thus freed from the distraction of his presence, we would churn 

              out bridal bouquets and altar vases by the dozens. At closing time, 

              the boss would return. Surveying a shop floor covered with scraps 

              of ribbon, leaves and stems, he&#39;d proclaim victory: "Well, we 

              got the job done, didn&#39;t we?" </p>

            <P> No matter how many times repeated, that performance was greeted 

              by a collective rolling of our eyes at the boss&#39;s inclusion 

              of himself in the "we" who had gotten the job done. During more 

              than one smoke break, we toyed with the calculation: If we had managed 

              to turn out X amount of work in the hours the boss left us in peace, 

              how much more might we have accomplished if he hadn&#39;t come in 

              at all? </p>

            <P> We raised precisely the philosophical question that had haunted 

              Prince Peter Kropotkin and Emma Goldman, the great theoreticians 

              of anarchism: Bosses, who needs them? </p>

            <P> Unlike their kissing cousins, the socialists, anarchists apply 

              that question to all social arrangements, from a small workshop 

              to the highest level of government. Socialists argue that the problem 

              with government is that it is in the hands of the wrong people. 

              Put right-minded folks -- that is, socialists -- in charge of government 

              and it would work just fine. </p>

            <P> Anarchists say that a boss is a boss, whether a factory owner, 

              a president or a commissar. Government is an unnecessary burden 

              at best and more likely a tyrannical noose around its subjects&#39; 

              necks, argued Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, the 19th-century French writer 

              and the anarchist movement&#39;s founding father. </p>

            <P> "To be governed," he wrote, "is to be at every operation, at every 

              transaction, noted, registered, enrolled, taxed, stamped, measured, 

              numbered, assessed, licensed, authorized, admonished, forbidden, 

              reformed, corrected, punished." </p>

            <P> Proudhon&#39;s solution was to get rid of all bosses without exception. 

              It was he who coined the political use of the word anarchy, which 

              comes from the Greek and means "no leader." Proudhon and his successors 

              taught that, just as we managed nicely in that florist shop without 

              the boss, so should all of society be run by the workers themselves. 

            </p>

            <P> How, you ask, would those little worker-administered workshops 

              coordinate their efforts in the absence of any higher order authority? 

            </p>

            <P> Just like we did in the florist shop. Not infrequently, we would 

              run short of some necessity in those afternoons when the boss was 

              gone. We didn&#39;t phone up Sportsman&#39;s Racetrack and ask that 

              he be paged so he might call the wholesale supply house. We just 

              called ourselves and asked our counterparts, the worker bees there, 

              to send over some mums, say, real quick. </p>

            <P> But can you run a whole country that way? But how do you pay each 

              other for supplies and products if there is no government to guarantee 

              the money supply? </p>

            <P> Those are, indeed, tough questions. </p>

            <P> The fascinating thing is that they don&#39;t necessarily seem 

              important to ordinary people, when they find themselves up against 

              the wall of real life. Anarchism can make sense to them. </p>

            <P> A few years back, I was traveling through a part of Greece where 

              a little village had been scheduled for demolition so an airport 

              could be expanded. A government wanting to take away their ancestral 

              homes had no standing in the eyes of the peasants who lived there. 

              They were flying black flags, the traditional symbol of anarchy, 

              from their windows. On their walls they had written: i anarkhia, 

              i thanatos (anarchy or death). </p>

            <P> The British novelist George Orwell was a participant-observer 

              in the Spanish Civil War of the 1930s. He reports that, in the midst 

              of that bloody conflict, the prostitutes of Barcelona kicked out 

              their pimps and procurers and proclaimed themselves to be an anarchist 

              commune. </p>

            <P> Consider, then, globalization from the viewpoint of its opponents 

              -- and not just those young people who take to the streets but all 

              those with the nagging suspicion that something is afoot that isn&#39;t 

              to their benefit. Every few months, they see the leaders of a few 

              nations coming together to plot the next step in the process. They 

              do so behind closed doors. Everybody else is, essentially, being 

              enrolled, taxed, stamped, measured, numbered, assessed, licensed 

              -- whether they like it or not. </p>

            <P> Now, the leaders of the great economic powers aren&#39;t dummies. 

              They get reasonable public-relations advice, so they don&#39;t come 

              on like Louis XIV and say that they are doing these things simply 

              for their own benefit. </p>

            <P> To the contrary, they piously proclaim that free trade will launch 

              all of us into an unprecedented era of worldwide prosperity. They 

              soft-pedal a reasonable corollary to that prediction: While we might 

              be headed to a rosy economic future, there are bound to be bumps 

              in the road leading there. History makes that probable: The industrial 

              revolution of the 19th century similarly was hailed as making prosperity 

              available to all -- which eventually it pretty much did. But not 

              before several generations of factory workers had put in 12-hour 

              days working in oppressive conditions and living in slums. </p>

            <P> Which is why a lot of those 19th-century workers lent a ready 

              ear to the radical political prophets of their day. Accordingly, 

              we shouldn&#39;t be all that surprised to see increasing numbers 

              of our contemporaries fly the black flag of anarchy, at least mentally. 

              For those who feel that the scale of authority is growing so large 

              as to crush the average person, anarchy is a logical mental refuge 

              -- precisely because it holds out the promise of a return to a human-scale 

              society. </p>

            <P> Of course, like the fabled Missourians, you could say: "Show me" 

              an example of where anarchism has worked. It can&#39;t be done, 

              but there is no reason to think that such practical considerations 

              make it any less attractive. To the contrary, the anarchist impulse 

              seems to flourish where the prospects for success are dimmest. Something 

              about taking on the greatest powers in the name of the powerless 

              has always made anarchists equate martyrdom with accomplishment.
