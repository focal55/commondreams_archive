FASTER THAN you can say "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon," my mood has 

changed - from feeling good to feeling paranoid about being an Asian - 

specifically a Chinese American - in America. That is what a little spy plane 

accident along the southeast China coast can do.

<P>While many Americans are happy that the 24 U.S. Navy personnel aboard the 

spy plane are back in the good old U.S.A., I've been in a funk. The near 

crisis between the United States and the People's Republic of China put me and 

other Chinese Americans in the middle, not a comfortable place to be right now.

<P>I'll tell you why.

<P>When two Springfield, Ill., talk-show hosts at station WQLZ call for the 

internment of Chinese Americans the way the federal government locked up 

Japanese Americans during World War II, you can begin to understand why I 

might feel a little queasy.

<P>When the same radio personalities advocate a boycott of Chinese restaurants 

until "our troops" come home, you will know why there's a knot in my stomach.

<P>When Don Bleu, a popular radio disk jockey on 101.3 FM in San Francisco,p 

calls a restaurant in China and mockingly teases the person who answers the 

surprise call, you can sense the rage building inside my normally calm 

interior.

<P>When Pulitzer Prize-winning editorial cartoonist Pat Oliphant engages raw 

racist stereotypes to depict a Chinese waiter, then you will know why I might 

question the sanctity of the First Amendment.

<P>When some of the top newspaper editors in the United States, at their 

annual convention, laugh at a crude skit by a group called Capitol Steps 

mocking Chinese people, you will know why I am depressed about my chosen 

profession.

<P>All these incidents have occurred since a U.S. spy plane collided with a 

Chinese fighter jet on April 1.

<P>Adding to my melancholy has been the super patriotic tone - sometimes 

indignant, sometimes hysterical - of major news media personalities such as 

Katie Couric, Tim Russert and even the usually mild-mannered David Broder of 

the Washington Post.

<P>Appearing on Sunday's "Meet the Press" show on NBC, Broder said, "The 

Chinese are not nice people."

<P>A journalist myself, I had to ask how he knew that. Has he met all 1.3 

billion of them? In fact, over the past several weeks, "the Chinese" have been 

labeled a lot of nasty things.

<P>Here is where it gets disconcerting for me and other Chinese Americans.

<P>Understand this: Even though I am of Chinese descent, I am no stool pigeon 

for the People's Republic of China or its leaders. I am not privy to their 

thinking or strategizing about positioning China in the unpredictable 

geopolitical landscape of the 21st century.

<P>For that matter, I know very little of the inner workings of our government.

<P>Otherwise, why was I - and perhaps you? - surprised to learn that U.S. spy 

planes were buzzing China's coastline. For what purpose? As far as we know, 

China isn't sending spy planes along the California coastline.

<P>Targeting China as the next Evil Empire has been an evolutionary process in 

the United States. The new Bush administration apparently plans to talk and 

act tough toward China.

<P>That isn't going to make life any easier for me and other Chinese Americans.

<P>Some Americans appear not to be able to distinguish between Chinese Americans 

and Chinese from China. We all look alike, I guess.
