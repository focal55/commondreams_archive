Too bad Bill Clinton didn't govern as a lame-duck from the very start. I might have liked him better.

<p>In his final days, he's going out quacking.</p>

							

<p>He finally signed the treaty to establish the International Criminal Court, though--truth be told--his Administration had added language to it making it exceedingly unlikely that U.S. soldiers, diplomats, or officials would ever be dragged in. Still, the Republicans and the Pentagon are aghast (and somewhere, Henry Kissinger is quivering, or so I hope).</p>

							

<p>Clinton also issued an executive order that will enable the nine million federal employees to receive coverage for mental illness on a par with the coverage they receive for physical ailments.</p>

							

<p>He's issued a new standard on ergonomics.</p>

							

<p>And he's suddenly discovered the issue of D.C. statehood, albeit symbolically, changing the license plates on his limo to read &quot;No Taxation Without Representation.&quot;</p>

							

<p>He's also made a controversial--though principled--recess appointment of Roger Gregory to the appeals court in Richmond. Gregory is the first black ever to hold that position, which Jesse Helms had used his power to reserve for whites only.</p>

							

<p>There is much more Clinton could do. </p>

							

<p>He could signal an end to sanctions in Iraq.</p>

							

<p>He could commute the sentences of all federal prisoners on death row.</p>

							

<p>He could commute the sentences of nonviolent federal drug offenders.</p>

							

<p>He could commute the sentence of Leonard Peltier.</p>

							

<p>He could end the policy of don't ask, don't tell and order the military to accept gays, lesbians, bisexuals and transgender people. He's still commander-in-chief, after all.</p>

<p>Lame duck or no, Clinton still has a lot of quacking to do in his last two weeks in office. He might as well make some noise on his way out the door.
