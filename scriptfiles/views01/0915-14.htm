On Friday, the Senate voted 98-0 for a war resolution. It says: 
"The president is authorized to use all necessary and appropriate force 
against those nations, organizations, or persons he determines planned, 
authorized, committed, or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on 
Sept. 11, 2001, or harbored such organizations or persons, in order to 
prevent any future acts of international terrorism against the United 
States by such nations, organizations or persons."

          
<p>This resolution, written as a blank check, is payable with vast 
quantities of human corpses.

<p align="center">*     *     *     *     *

          
<p>The black-and-white TV footage is grainy and faded, but it still 
jumps off the screen -- a portentous clash between a prominent reporter and 
a maverick politician. On the CBS program "Face the Nation," journalist 
Peter Lisagor argued with a senator who stood almost alone on Capitol Hill, 
strongly opposing the war in Vietnam from the outset.

          
<p>"Senator, the Constitution gives to the president of the United 
States the sole responsibility for the conduct of foreign policy," Lisagor 
said.

          
<p>"Couldn't be more wrong," Wayne Morse broke in. "You couldn't make 
a more unsound legal statement than the one you have just made. This is the 
promulgation of an old fallacy that foreign policy belongs to the president 
of the United States. That's nonsense."

          
<p>Lisagor: "To whom does it belong then, senator?"

          
<p>Morse: "It belongs to the American people.... And I am pleading 
that the American people be given the facts about foreign policy."

          
<p>Lisagor: "You know, senator, that the American people cannot 
formulate and execute foreign policy."

          
<p>Morse: "Why do you say that? ... I have complete faith in the 
ability of the American people to follow the facts if you'll give them. And 
my charge against my government is -- we're not giving the American people 
the facts."

          
<p>In early August 1964, Morse was one of only two senators to vote 
against the Tonkin Gulf resolution, which served as a green light for the 
Vietnam War. While reviled by much of the press in his home state of Oregon 
as well as nationwide, he persisted with fierce oratory for peace. It would 
have been much easier to acquiesce to the media's war fever. But Morse was 
not the silent type, especially in matters of conscience.

          
<p>On Feb. 27, 1968, I sat in a small room at the Capitol to watch a 
hearing of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Six members of the panel 
were seated around a long table. Most of all, I remember Morse's voice, 
raspy and urgent.

          
<p>"My views are no longer lonely," he noted at one point, adding: 
"You have millions of people who are not going to support this tyranny that 
American boys are being killed in South Vietnam to maintain in power."

          
<p>Morse summed up his position on negotiations between the U.S. 
government and its Vietnamese adversaries: "Who are we to say there have to 
be two Vietnams? They are not going to do it and they shouldn't do it. 
There isn't any reason in the world why the North Vietnamese and the 
Vietcong should ever come to a negotiating table on the basis that there 
must be two Vietnams."

          
<p>Moments before the hearing adjourned, Morse said that he did not 
"intend to put the blood of this war on my hands."

          
<p>At the time, Oregon's senior senator was remarkable because he 
challenged the morality -- not just the "winability" -- of the war. He 
passionately asserted that the United States had no right to impose its 
will on the world. In the process, he made enemies of many fellow 
Democrats, including President Lyndon Johnson.

          
<p>Like most heretics, Morse suffered consequences. After 24 years in 
the Senate, he lost a race for re-election in November 1968. The winner was 
a slick politician named Robert Packwood, who denounced Morse's antiwar fervor.

          
<p>In his lifetime, Morse became a media pariah. In the 
quarter-century since his death, political reporters have rarely mentioned 
his name.

          
<p>"I don't know why we think, just because we're mighty, that we 
have the right to try to substitute might for right," Morse said on 
national television in 1964. "And that's the American policy in Southeast 
Asia -- just as unsound when we do it as when Russia does it."

          
<p>Three years later, he declared: "We're going to become guilty, in 
my judgment, of being the greatest threat to the peace of the world. It's 
an ugly reality, and we Americans don't like to face up to it. I hate to 
think of the chapter of American history that's going to be written in the 
future in connection with our outlawry in Southeast Asia."

          
<p>Such heresy infuriated many powerful politicians -- and 
journalists -- while Wayne Morse did all he could to block a war train 
speeding to catastrophe.

<p align="center">*     *     *     *     *

         
<p>Now, in the autumn of 2001, there's no one stepping forward from 
the Senate to help block the war train. We'll need to do it ourselves.
