ST. PAUL &#151; U.S. Sen. Paul Wellstone had just finished rousing 

              a crowd of 2,000 trade unionists, farmers, environmentalists and 

              students with a fiery condemnation of George W. Bush&#146;s free 

              trade policies, and now he had a problem. He couldn&#146;t get down 

              the steps of the Minnesota State Capitol here to join the march 

              protesting Bush&#146;s Free Trade Area of the Americas scheme.

<P>Wellstone is just too popular with his constituents. He couldn&#146;t 

              move in the face of a steady stream of men in Teamsters jackets, 

              farm wives holding newborns, green-haired college kids and Catholic 

              priests approaching to offer variations on the words of a steelworker 

              who told Wellstone, "I am so damn proud to be able to say you&#146;re 

              my senator."</P>

<P>Most of them also asked a question: "How come Bush hates you so 

              much?"</P>

<P>Let there be no doubt as to the identity of George W. Bush&#146;s 

              least favorite Democratic U.S. senator. It&#146;s Wellstone, the 

              rabble-rousing Progressive who represents not just Minnesota but 

              what remains of the fighting populist spirit of the Upper Midwest.</P>

<P>Elected in 1990 following a grass-roots campaign in which he toured 

              the state on a beat-up school bus, Wellstone was the No. 1 target 

              in 1996 for Republicans who thought the senator had doomed himself 

              with a lonely vote against punitive "welfare reform" legislation. 

              He won re-election with ease that year, proving to both the Republicans 

              and to their whimpering Democratic allies that bashing the poor 

              might not be nearly so smart a political move as Dick Morris thought.</P>

<P>As Wellstone prepares to seek a third term next year, it would 

              be reasonable to assume that he might finally be in for some smooth 

              political sailing. But reasonableness doesn&#146;t figure into the 

              calculations of the Bush White House, where the president himself, 

              Vice President Dick Cheney and political commissar Karl Rove practice 

              the politics of vengeance.</P>

<P>The Bushies despise Wellstone, who unlike most Senate Democrats 

              has been fighting spirited battles against the new administration&#146;s 

              policies on everything from the environment to the tax cuts for 

              the rich to military aid for the "Plan Colombia" drug war boondoggle. 

              Other Democratic senators who face re-election contests in 2002 

              are, according to polls, more vulnerable than Wellstone. But the 

              Bush camp has been focusing highest-level attention on "Plan Wellstone" 

              &#151; its project to silence progressive opposition.</P>

<P>Last Tuesday as Minnesota House Majority Leader Tim Pawlenty was 

              just hours away from announcing his intention to mount a Republican 

              challenge to Wellstone, he got an urgent call from Rove asking him 

              to step aside for Bush&#146;s preferred candidate, St. Paul Mayor 

              Norm Coleman.</P>

<P>Then, on Wednesday morning, with just 90 minutes to go before his 

              planned announcement, Pawlenty was driving his kids home from a 

              dental appointment. The car phone rang, and Pawlenty found himself 

              talking to Cheney. The vice president told Pawlenty that Bush did 

              not want Coleman &#151; a party-switching former Democrat who chaired 

              the losing Bush presidential campaign in Minnesota &#151; to face 

              a difficult primary contest from a credible Republican.</P>

<P>Pawlenty finally "agreed" to step aside.</P>

<P>Minnesota is not the only state where the Bush camp is seeking 

              to pick senators. But the level of involvement in the Wellstone 

              race is remarkable. Coleman dropped a planned gubernatorial bid 

              after two White House pressure sessions with Bush. And now that 

              Coleman is leaning toward a Senate race, Bush, Cheney and Rove are 

              pulling out all the stops to make sure they are in charge of the 

              anti-Wellstone effort.</P>

<P>Even Pawlenty, as he was proclaiming himself a "team player," admitted 

              that "it makes you wonder about the process and the integrity of 

              the process."</P>

<P>What does Wellstone say? "I think the way to oppose George W. Bush 

              is to stand up to him, to speak out when his policies are wrong, 

              to put holds on bad legislation he&#146;s promoting. Obviously, 

              that&#146;s not the sort of opposition Bush and Cheney approve of. 

              The nice thing is that, even if they can dictate the Republican 

              nominee, the people of Minnesota still get to choose their senator."
