You've got to hand it to Ralph Nader -- grudgingly, if you're a die-hard Naderphobic Democrat, or perhaps even gleefully, if you're a rock-ribbed Republican. 
<P>Both mainstream political parties couldn't help but sit up and notice the events of Saturday night at Portland's Rose Garden. Nader, the former Green Party presidential candidate, drew 7,000 cheering people to the arena for a new kind of "civic festival" that he promises will sweep the nation.

For a  '60s icon ridiculed only a year ago in this newspaper for being "a quart low on charisma," Saturday night's accomplishment was astonishing. Most who attended paid up to $10 a head. They showed up in the middle of the dog days of summer. And unlike the Nader rally that drew 10,000 to Memorial Coliseum nearly a year ago, this one happened without the impetus of a national election. 
<P>Celebrities Eddie Vedder, Jello Biafra and Danny Glover helped the draw, no doubt, but this was really Nader's show. 
</P>
<P>"You just have to ask yourself," he told the crowd, "is anyone else doing this, is anybody else bringing out thousands of people?" 
</P>
<P>The answer is no -- nobody is, unless you count George W. Bush, whose ascendancy to the presidency is bitterly attributed by many Democrats to Nader's role as spoiler in the extraordinarily close 2000 election. His third-party candidacy drew what Portland pollster Tim Hibbitts called "the 'bleep-you' vote," and it cost Al Gore dearly. 
</P>
<P>By focusing on Nader, though, his critics risk missing the main lesson of Saturday night's remarkable happening. Sure, the gaunt, dour-looking man in the rumpled clothes is an easy target for derision. Many find him to be preachy, arrogant, egotistical and disturbingly angry -- "Darth Vader in a cheap blue suit," as a liberal columnist once described him. 
</P>
<P>But the Rose Garden rally, though Ralph Nader's shining hour, wasn't really about him. It was about Green Party politics and the hard work of a lot of Oregonians who find meaning in Nader's condemnation of the country's two main political parties, what he calls "this duopoly that's undermining American democracy." 
</P>
<P>We don't share Nader's dark vision of "one corporate party with two heads wearing the same makeup." Healthy, fundamental differences still remain between the Democratic and Republican camps. Nonetheless, some Americans on both sides of the political aisle feel frustrated by the powerful forces that tug elected leaders toward the middle ground embraced by most mainstream American voters. That explains the considerable appeal of mavericks like Jesse Ventura, John McCain and, less recently, Ross Perot. 
</P>
<P>Whether Nader can ever ignite a phenomenon beyond the thorn-in-the-side role remains to be seen. But Saturday night in Portland, his Green Party supporters showed that amazing things can happen through grass-roots activism -- that a relatively small number of activists can have a large impact through hard work and smart organizing. 
</P>
<P>Nader's dream of a nationwide outbreak of such "civic festivals" may never spread beyond the borders of Oregon -- or the boundaries of Portland, for that matter. But the vitality Saturday night was real, and it will echo as a testament to the impressive energy of the city's Green faithful.
