On April 1, 2000, nearly one in 33 California blacks was behind bars, recent 
census figures reveal.  At the same time, one of every 205 whites and one in 
122 Latinos were held in the state’s jails and prisons.  California has a 
black incarceration crisis.

<p>Why are California blacks so much more likely than whites and Latinos to be 
locked up?  The San Francisco Chronicle reported on August 9 that the 
economy is one factor.

<p>"Part of it is that blacks, as a population, have tended to be on the 
fringes of the mainstream economy, and those who end up in the criminal 
justice system tend to be those on the fringes," Dan Macallair said.  He is 
an associate director of the Center on Juvenile and Criminal Justice, a 
research group based in S.F.

<p>Well, why does the division of labor make black workers disproportionately 
needless in the economy?

<p>Perhaps a partial explanation of the link between black occupations and 
incarceration is the 1990s decline of California’s high-wage military jobs.  
The state saw dozens of military base closures that cut stable, well-paying 
work last decade.  Three military bases closed since 1993 in my hometown of 
Sacramento.  Defense Secretary Rumsfeld has announced that he wants to close 
additional military bases nationwide.

<p>Crucially for some black workers, the military has been an equal opportunity 
employer.  A number of black workers and their families, for example, 
migrated to California from the South during World War II. They were 
attracted to cities such as Los Angeles, Long Beach, Sacramento and San 
Francisco by the high wages of military employment.

<p>Immiseration breeds incarceration.  Neither is a natural condition of human 
beings of any skin color.  Immiseration was spurred by Clinton’s 1996 
welfare reform.  It knocked down a key peg of FDR’s New Deal legislation by 
eliminating the federal guarantee of cash assistance to society's poorest 
people, half of whom are children.  Up to 700,000 former welfare recipients 
were expected to be forced to enter a California job market that created 
only 400,000 new jobs during a 12-month period that ended in June 1997, the 
London Economist reported.  How many jobless black workers ended up in the 
state’s jails and prisons?

<p>For most blacks most of the time, employment in the U.S. between 1619 and 
1865 took the form of chattel slavery.  Today all Americans work for 
wages—if they can find a job.  Indeed, one could surmise that in 
California’s “new economy” of networked computers and “24/7” workers, 
employers have a weak demand for black labor.  Prisons and jails appear to 
be a way to contain this surplus population of California black workers.

<p>Other factors spurring the overrepresentation of African Americans in 
California’s jails and prisons are easy to find.

<p>Take the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1998. This federal legislation states that 
possession of a little as five grams of crack cocaine carries a mandatory 
five-year prison sentence without the possibility of parole, but possession 
of a hundred times that amount of cocaine powder (the drug preferred by 
middle- and upper-income white users) has no mandatory sentence.  At every 
step in the criminal justice system—from arrest to charging to convicting 
and sentencing—the data shows that blacks and Latinos are treated much more 
severely than whites.

<p>In addition, the pharmacological data shows that liquid cocaine—and not 
crack or powder cocaine—is the most addictive form of the drug.  Clarence 
Lusane details this in Pipe Dream Blues: Racism in the War on Drugs.  The 
“crack is more addictive” claim is a fraud which has been used by 
politicians and pundits to justify harsher sentences for those low-income 
blacks who use and sell crack cocaine.

<p>To be sure, there is an illegal drug use epidemic in California.  The 
state’s crisis of black incarceration is proof of that.  Doesn’t this mean 
that now rather than later is the time to discuss the treatment of such drug 
use as a health rather than a criminal issue?
