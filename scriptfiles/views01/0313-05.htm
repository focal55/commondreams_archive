If you&#146;ve been following Washington&#146;s latest outrage 

              --the rush to change the bankruptcy rules --you know all too well 

              that the banks and credit card companies have lavished hundreds 

              of thousands of dollars on our members of Congress for their votes.

<P>And you also know that members of Congress are so enamored with 

              the money they&#146;ve received that they wouldn&#146;t even consider 

              an exemption for the poor bloke who has to declare bankruptcy because 

              a severe medical problem took all his money.</P>

<P>The changes in the bankruptcy law are the quintessential example 

              of how corporate wealth has come to control government at the expense 

              of the average American citizen. Politicians who have the audacity 

              to call themselves representatives of the people would rather protect 

              corporations that make hundreds of millions in profits than the 

              family that runs into hard times because of unexpected medical bills, 

              the loss of income or some other uninsured calamity.</P>

<P>And what would be so laughable if it wasn&#146;t so terribly ugly 

              is to hear those politicians and their corporate sugar daddies claiming 

              that the new bankruptcy bills will actually help the "honest" Americans 

              with credit cards by holding down costs and, thus, interest rates.</P>

<P>What absolute nonsense. What outright lies.</P>

<P>The bankruptcy changes pushed by the GOP leadership and endorsed 

              by none other than that "compassionate conservative" George W. Bush 

              will push millions of more dollars into the coffers of businesses 

              that thrive by convincing ordinary Americans to go deeply in debt 

              and then charging them exorbitant rates to make sure they stay there.</P>

<P>Here&#146;s an example:</P>

<P>The other night in the mail came an unsolicited check for $1,004.28 

              from none other than Wells Fargo Financial, a bottom-feeding finance 

              company owned by the giant and famed Wells Fargo Bank. All I need 

              do is endorse it on the back and use it "to pay your holiday bills 

              or take care of upcoming expenses like taxes and insurance premiums."</P>

<P>Can you imagine being a single mom struggling to make the paycheck 

              stretch to the end of the month suddenly being tempted with a $1,004.28 

              check? That, of course, is exactly what Wells Fargo and the other 

              pillars of American finance are counting on.</P>

<P>But let&#146;s look at the small print on the back. The interest 

              rate this single mom will pay is 36 percent per year. That&#146;s 

              right, 36 percent! All she will have to do for the next 36 months 

              is send this company -- a company that members of Congress think 

              needs protection from those nasty poor people who might go bankrupt 

              --a check for $46. Total cost for that $1,004.28 over three years? 

              $1,656.</P>

<P>If this mom had any connections she could probably get a better 

              deal from some Mafia juice loaner in downtown Chicago. The only 

              difference is that Congress helps hold the gun so that Wells Fargo, 

              MBNA and their fellow travelers can collect.
