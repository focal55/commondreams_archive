Well, 101 

        days into the Junta and the fear mongers are having a heyday, aren't they? 

        Even good liberals and Democrats have joined in the mantra. To listen 

        to them, you'd think George W. Bush had opened the gates of hell and unleashed 

        the legions of Satan upon the American people.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">These good 

        people actually believe Junior has put the arsenic back in the water, 

        given the go-ahead to spew massive CO2 emissions into the air, torn up 

        our national forests, and raped the Alaskan wilderness. With all the fury 

        that has been whipped up, I'm sure any minute we'll also hear that Baby 

        Face Bush recently held up a 7-11 in Denver, and now plans to release 

        bubonic plague into the atmosphere over Ohio.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Now, don't 

        get me wrong. There's no doubt that this illegal squatter in the Oval 

        Office is not to be trusted farther than you can throw Katherine Harris. 

        But, please, let's cut the crap and tell the truth: George W. Bush has 

        done little more than CONTINUE the policies of the last eight years of 

        the Clinton/Gore administration. As hard as that is for many to swallow, 

        that is the truth -- and the sooner you stop the scare campaign, the sooner 

        we'll be able to fight Bush in a way that will stop him for good.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For eight 

        long years, Clinton/Gore resisted all efforts and recommendations to reduce 

        the carbon dioxide in the air and the arsenic in the water. Just last 

        October, Senate Democratic leader Tom Daschle and sixteen other Democrats 

        successfully led the way to STOP any reduction of arsenic in the water. 

        Why? Because Clinton and the Democrats were beholden to the very industries 

        who had financed their campaigns --- and who were responsible for high 

        levels of arsenic in the water.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On top of 

        that, Clinton/Gore became the first administration in twenty years NOT 

        to demand higher fuel efficiency standards from Detroit. Millions of barrels 

        of oil that did not need to be refined and spewed out into our air were 

        guzzled unnecessarily. It wasn't that way under Reagan. His administration 

        ordered that cars had to get more miles per gallon. Under Bush I, the 

        standards were made even stricter. Under Clinton -- zip. Nothing. How 

        many more people will die from cancer, how much faster will global warming 

        be sped up thanks to Bill and Al being in cahoots with one of their chief 

        patrons, the top lobbyist for the Big 3 auto companies -- Mr. Andrew Card, 

        currently the chief of staff for the man occupying the federal land at 

        1600 Pennsylvania Avenue? Am I the only one who remembers one of the most 

        lavish inaugural parties thrown for Clinton after his election? The host: 

        General Motors and its man-about-town in DC, Andrew Card.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Yes, there 

        is a difference between the Democrats and the Republicans. The Democrats 

        say one thing (&quot;Save the planet!&quot;), and then do another, quietly 

        and behind the scenes with all the bastards who make this world a dirtier 

        place. The Republicans just come right out and give the bastards a corner 

        office in the West Wing. In some ways, maybe it's better we see the evil 

        out in the open rather than covered up in a liberal sheep's clothing that 

        seems to fool a lot of people.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Bill Clinton 

        waited until the final days of his presidency to suddenly sign a number 

        of presidential decrees and regulations to improve our environment and 

        create safer working conditions. It was the ultimate cynical move. Wait 

        'til the last 48 hours of your term to finally do the right thing so that 

        your &quot;legacy&quot; will be improved. Every one of these regulations 

        Bush has &quot;overturned&quot; was signed by Clinton in December and 

        January. And that's ALL he did -- sign worthless pieces of paper.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Do you believe 

        Clinton removed the arsenic from the water? Not only did he NOT do that, 

        not only did he make us drink arsenic-laced water for the last 8 years, 

        this order he signed stipulated that the arsenic was not to be removed 

        from the water &quot;until 2004.&quot; That's right. Look it up. Clinton's 

        big environmental do-good act in the last minutes of his term guaranteed 

        that we would be drinking the same levels of arsenic we've been drinking 

        since 1942 -- the last time a REAL Democrat had the guts to stand up to 

        the mining interests and reduce the levels of this poison. The Canadians 

        and Europeans did it long ago. Clinton made it official that we would 

        all be drinking arsenic during the entire Bush administration. Maybe he 

        was doing us a favor.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">And how about 

        those COO emission regulations that Bush II overturned? Did I say &quot;overturn?&quot; 

        Overturn what? All Bush did was maintain the Clinton status quo. He said, 

        in essence, that &quot;I'm going to pollute the air at the very same levels 

        Clinton did during his entire eight years, just as you are going to drink 

        the same arsenic in the water under my watch as you did under Clinton's.&quot; 

        </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">And, like 

        the built-in three-year delay in his arsenic reductions, Clinton's orders 

        on the toxic emissions in his last days specified that they were not to 

        be totally reduced '&quot;until 2008, per the Kyoto agreement.&quot; So, 

        after violating the Kyoto accords he had signed by doing NOTHING about 

        CO2 in the past few years, he then tries to look good by doing NOTHING 

        about CO2 for another seven years! So the air that was dirty is still 

        dirty and will remain dirty, just as Clinton had ordered. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The list 

        goes on and on. For eight years Clinton did NOTHING about carpal tunnel 

        syndrome as it relates to OSHA regulations. Then, in the middle of pardoning 

        some rich guys during his all-night kegger on January 19, he decides to 

        finally do some good for all those women who sit at keyboards all day 

        and who, with their crippled hands, went to the polls TWICE to make him 

        their President. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Friends, 

        you are being misled and hoodwinked by a bunch of professional &quot;liberals&quot; 

        who did NOTHING themselves for eight years to clean up these messes -- 

        and now all they can do is attack people like Ralph Nader who has devoted 

        his ENTIRE life to every single one of these issues. What unmitigated 

        gall! They blame Nader for giving us Bush? I blame THEM for being Bush! 

        They suck off the same corporate teat and they support stuff like NAFTA 

        which, according to the Sierra Club, has DOUBLED the pollution along the 

        Mexican border where the American factories have moved. And then they 

        wring their hands over Bush and his &quot;reversals!&quot; Where is Orwell 

        when we need him? How much slicker can the doublespeak get?</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Had Clinton 

        done the job those of us who voted for him in 1992 expected him to do, 

        we wouldn't be in the pickle we're in. Imagine if on his first day in 

        office over eight years ago Clinton had ordered a reduction of the arsenic 

        in the drinking water -- and all of America had been drinking cleaner, 

        safer water for the last eight years. Do you think there is any way in 

        hell this Junior Bush would have been able to say, &quot;OK, America, 

        you've been drinking water without poison in it long enough. Time to go 

        back to the good old days of sucking down that ol' arsenic!&quot;? Hell 

        no! The public -- no one -- would have stood for it. And he'd know that. 

        He wouldn't even have tried it. But because Clinton waited to the last 

        minute and never removed any of this crud from the water or the air, there 

        was no political or popular support base for the decision. So it was easy 

        for Bush to do what he did. He figured, you're not going to miss what 

        you never had removed in the first place.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Finally, 

        a word about that order Bush issued to ban money for abortions overseas. 

        Wrong again. Pro-choice Clinton, like the three presidents before him, 

        had already signed an order banning any American funds to pay for abortions 

        in foreign countries. What Bush did was to expand the order to include 

        cutting off any monies to foreign birth control groups that offer abortion 

        as an alternative. Worse, yes -- but he only got away with it because 

        our Democratic president had laid the groundwork in continuing the abortion-funds 

        cut-off, placing his &quot;liberal&quot; approval on a piece of the right-wing 

        agenda. If you give the devil a bone, he doesn't just go away -- he wants 

        the whole damn leg. </font></p>

<p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">So spare 

        me all the hand wringing and indignant moralizing. Those who want to turn 

        Bush into some sort of cartoon monster have an agenda -- to keep most 

        of us from seeing the beast that they themselves have become. Of course 

        they hate Ralph Nader. He's an ugly reminder that they sold out a long 

        time ago -- and he didn't. Blame Nader, blame Bush, it's all part of the 

        same distraction, to keep you from focusing on this one, very important 

        fact: Republican arsenic or Democratic arsenic, it really is the same 

        damn crap being forced down your throat.
