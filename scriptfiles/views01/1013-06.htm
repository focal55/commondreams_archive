During his presidency, Franklin Roosevelt said of then Nicaraguan dictator

Anastasio Samosa, "he's a son of a bitch, but he's OUR son of a bitch".  

When Roosevelt, the legendary liberal spoke these words I believe he was

commenting on the necessary compromises of statecraft as he saw them.  He

believed, we, the USA, needed a Nicaraguan government that was friendly to

our interests regardless of how that government governed. Samosa governed

viciously; he held state power largely by virtue of force, and he used that

state power to exploit the country and its people for the sole benefit of

himself and a few cronies.  He was indeed an evil son of a bitch and more. 

But Roosevelt and other U.S. presidents backed his regime anyway, in effect

saying that they endorsed spending Nicaraguan life and happiness to buy

American gains.  Such a callous disregard for non-American life lies at the

heart of our current dilemma.



<p>"He's a son of a bitch, but he's OUR son of a bitch." 



<p>President Richard Nixon might have once said the same thing about Manuel

Noriega, and, during the Afghan war against the Soviet Union, President

Ronald Reagan might have said the same about Osama bin Laden.  Of course,

Samosa didn't subsequently fall out of favor as the other two did.  And

Noriega never turned vicious against his handlers and benefactors as bin

Laden apparently has.  Nevertheless, all three share the fact of US

Government sponsorship at times when our government had substantial

knowledge of their despicable activities.



<p>Today bin Laden stands out among his colleagues because he likely spawned an

organization that shook this nation to its core.  The attacks shocked us

all.  I still feel adrift in a strange world.  I still need to reassemble

the pieces of my former life, and I need to do it on a violent and

threatening sea.  



<p>Bin Laden may well have masterminded the attacks on the World Trade Center

Towers and the Pentagon.  However, We, the People, do well to keep in mind

that the affects we feel have more to do with how visible his violence

became to our eyes on September 11th.  Those attacks did not differ from

many other violent acts in the essential qualities of their violence or even

their intensity.  Bin Laden is the CIA-trained attack dog, whose rabidity

the CIA cultivated while arrogantly believing that they could adequately

direct the destruction, fear and hate he produced.  And even if they

couldn't control bin Laden, they had the confidence that his evil doings

would remain far from our national borders and our domestic psyche. 

Obviously, they were terribly wrong.



<p>I say "they" the CIA or the US Government or the Bush Administration, but I

cannot truly separate "them" from "us", from We, the People, because we

enjoy something of a democracy in this country.  With that privilege comes

responsibility for the actions our elected and unelected leaders and

government functionaries take on our behalf.  At the very least we have an

obligation to try to know the truth rather than hide behind comforting

fables about our innate national goodness or an unquestioning faith that

those in power have more information, knowledge and wisdom than each of us. 

Such blindness constitutes willful ignorance and complicity in the

abominations.  



<p>Confronting harsh truths discomforts me. I do not wish to believe that we

bolstered the regimes of criminals like the elder Samosa or his son

Anastasio, of Fulgencia Batista, Chiang Kai Shek, Mohamed Suharto, Ferdinand

Marcos, Roberto D'Abuisson, the Shah of Iran, Mobutu Sese Seko, and Augusto

Pinochet.  But we did.  I do not wish to acknowledge that my tax dollars

have been used to undermine and destroy democratically elected governments

in the Congo, Guatemala, Chile and Nicaragua.  I do not wish to know how

these actions helped cause tens of thousands of innocent deaths and

suffering beyond measure.  But we did. I wish these lists were not so long

or that they were at least comprehensive, but I know they don't even

approach completeness.   I have an obligation to try to know more.  We all

have that obligation especially in times like these when our elected

representatives lose their courage to question, and the mass media work so

hard to create the belief that the overwhelming majority of us embrace the

strategies of escalated violence.  We have an obligation to learn so that we

can stop the list from growing longer, so we can effectively combat

terrorism and the violence it employs.



<p>During the past three weeks I've thought a lot about the cycle of violence. 

Recently I realized that I have a kind of intellectual reflex that kicks in

when I employ such familiar lenses.  It's as though I pull out the analytic

tool I call the cycle of violence and use it to process the evidence at hand

without giving the tool much thought.  I don't normally remember that I see

a cycle of violence but many other folks may not.



<p>I see the cycle of violence as a dynamic phenomenon that spirals ever upward

in intensity.  I hit you, and cause an injury.  You respond by hitting me

back harder than I hit you.  I take that harder hit as disproportionately

heavy, and want to even the score.  Actually, I probably want to increase

the pain I inflict just to stop you from hitting back.  My implicit message

to you is that I can cause you much more pain than you can cause me.  And so

on and so on, as we climb higher and higher trying to get to the top of the

spiral to claim victory.  But there is no top, and, even if there were, no

treasure awaits the victor only enormous loss, for violence eats the flesh

of its perpetrators.



<p>In the school yard of my youth where stick ball and male energy reigned

supreme, fist fights seldom happened.  Most of the time the boys who got in

conflict, boys who got on the cycle of violence, found a way to break the

cycle and get off before undue harm was done.  Friends on both sides acted

to assist this process.  And the harm that was done was small enough so that

it could be healed quickly and easily.  More and more I wish we could return

to that school yard.



<p>Statecraft has taken this country high on the spiral and far along the cycle

of violence road.  The magnitude of the attacks on September 11th should

tell us that clearly; they reflect this nation's foreign policy history of

back to us.  I have often heard that in the aftermath of September 11th,

many stunned and perplexed lips asked the rhetorical question, "what did we

do to deserve this?"  I think the confusion comes from folks making a

misguided association between individual residents and the national

government that claims to represent the citizenry.  Of course, the

individuals killed in the World Trade Center Towers were innocent of direct

wrong-doing against Arabs or Islam.  However, the government that claims to

represent us has done plenty of wrong, and we need to acknowledge those

wrongs in order to make our way off the cycle of violence.



<p>Many folks had and still have no idea why any group or individual would

want to employ such terrible violence against this country.  We presumed our

country and ourselves to be innocent.  Fair enough for starters.  The stated

first principle of our legal traditions says a defendant is innocent until

proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.  But the initial presumption of

innocence does not remove the obligation to examine.



<p>Have a look at the evidence that indicts this country as an agent of

violence.  Have a close look.  Have a look at our recent policies toward

Nicaragua where our resident SOB stole from the material aid other

governments and individuals sent to his country to relieve the widespread

human suffering caused by a catastrophic earth quake.  Read about the US

sponsored war of terror waged against the popular government that deposed

that SOB.  We waged war against a government that outlawed the death penalty

as one of its first official acts because it knew how important it was to

free itself from the cycle of violence.  We waged war against a government

that won overwhelming voter approval in an election almost universally

judged fair among the nations of the world.  We waged war contrary to a

ruling by the World Court and our own domestic law.



<p>Of course, Nicaragua is not the Middle East or Central Asia, and these

atrocities happened in the past.  I offer the story as an example of the

pattern of US government behavior rather than as an identification of a

single cause of the September 11th attacks.  I urge you to look closely at

the Islamic world and our government's policies toward that world in light

of our historical patterns. President Bush tells us that civilization's task

is to root out terrorism everywhere and eliminate it.  I couldn't agree more

even though we differ on where to start.  I say let's start right here in

our own government's foreign policy.  Let's start with the low-cost or

no-cost measures that will demonstrate to the rest of the world that we

really want to end terrorism rather than simply use overwhelming force to

punish those who use terrorism against us.



<p>Let's immediately close the School of the Americas, the US version of bin

Laden's academies.  Many of the SOA graduates have gone on to commit heinous

crimes against their country men and women.  In so doing they use their

official positions, and they probably use techniques they learned in school.
