Where's Ralph? That's what many enthusiastic supporters of Nader's 

              2000 presidential campaign have been asking. Even though more people 

              were paying attention to politics during the Florida election mess 

              than they were during the campaign, Nader chose not to go to the 

              Sunshine State. Nor has there been a coordinated effort to mobilize 

              the tens of thousands of active Naderites recruited during the campaign 

              to take their energy into the Green Party, let alone any serious 

              attempt to enroll rank-and-file Nader voters as Greens. Indeed, 

              Nader himself is still not a Green Party member. Nor has any organization 

              been formed to give those Nader supporters who are not prepared 

              to join the Greens another vehicle for independent, issues- oriented 

              political action. So what's going on?

<p>Ask Nader, and he maintains he has been doing a lot. "It's very 

              hard to get press attention, much more so than in the campaign," 

              he says. Undoubtedly true--but Nader gave no press conferences of 

              his own in December or January, and sent out only two press releases; 

              nor did he stage any media events with pizzazz. </p>

            <p>And what about Florida? "Medea Benjamin represented the Greens 

              in Florida," he

            says, "and she did a great job." But the Green Senate candidate from 

            California garnered no national media attention of the kind Nader 

            might have, given the thousands of hours of airtime the cable news 

            networks devoted to the endless squabbling over the vote count. 

            <p>As for the Greens, Nader says he hasn't become a member because, 

              "I don't want to get involved in Green Party internal disputes and 

              struggles--if I was a member, I'd have to take sides." Besides, 

              adds Nader--who has made it evident he almost certainly intends 

              to run another presidential campaign in 2004--"we've got to appeal 

              to the independent vote" that includes "tens of millions" whose 

              concerns extend beyond the Greens' agenda "and historically, I've 

              never joined any party." </p>

            <p>As to his invisibility during the confirmation hearings for Bush's 

              cabinet, Nader says the Democrats shut him out: "I sent letters 

              to [Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick] Leahy--we even 

              had one hand-delivered--asking to testify against John Ashcroft, 

              and he didn't even have the courtesy to respond." He also tried 

              to testify against Spencer Abraham and Gale Norton, but was refused. 

            </p>

            <p>Why, then, didn't Nader hold a press conference denouncing the 

              spineless Senate Dems for their token opposition to Ashcroft--who 

              lied repeatedly without challenge at his hearing--and their failure 

              to seriously contest the anti-environmental appointments of the 

              reactionary Norton and the polluter-friendly new EPA head, Christie 

              Todd Whitman? And when the Democrats symbolized their moral bankruptcy 

              by choosing notorious bagman and fixer Terry McAuliffe as chair 

              of the Democratic National Committee, where were the salvos from 

              Nader? "Well," he says weakly, "I've done a lot of all this on radio." 

            </p>

            <p>Nader repeatedly emphasizes how preoccupied he has been trying 

              to comply with the Federal Election Commission regulations governing 

              campaign spending and the transition out of campaign mode, including 

              restrictions on how campaign staff can be deployed to other activities. 

              (Nader's Washington campaign office is still open, but down to a 

              skeleton staff.) "The FEC-dictated process is very strict and very 

              complicated," Nader notes, adding, "did you know that it costs $5,000 

              a month just to rent the software for FEC compliance?" </p>

            <p>But as one who publicly supported Nader's candidacy in 2000 (including 

              in these pages) and his symbolic non-campaign of 1996, I feel compelled 

              to be frank: These excuses sound to anyone steeped in politics like 

              "the FEC ate my homework." Clearly, there's more to Nader's absence 

              from the public scene than he's willing to admit. </p>

            <p>After discussions with a number of Nader's closest advisers, friends 

              and staff, a clearer picture emerges. For one thing, Nader has received 

              conflicting counsel. Some of the influential staffers from the Nader-created 

              skein of nonprofits, particularly Public Citizen, have been reluctant 

              to see Nader conduct a frontal assault on the Democrats just before 

              a congressional election year. </p>

            <p>But while the conventional wisdom holds that the first off-year 

              election is always good for the party out of power in the White 

              House, 2002 does not appear to be a banner year for the Democrats. 

              They will likely lose at least three Senate incumbents: Louisiana's 

              Mary Landrieu, South Dakota's Timothy Johnson and Montana's Max 

              Baucus. Georgia's Max Cleland, Iowa's Tom Harkin and even New Jersey's 

              Robert Torricelli could all have tough races as well. In contrast, 

              unless the ailing Jesse Helms retires or the senile Strom Thurmond 

              drops dead in midterm, most of the Republican senators up next year 

              are pretty safe, with the best chance of a Democratic pick-up in 

              New Hampshire, where Gov. Jean Shaheen will run for lunatic blowhard 

              Bob Smith's seat. </p>

            <p>Things aren't much better in the House, since Republicans control 

              nearly two-thirds of the statehouses and dominate the legislatures 

              in half of the states, which must draw new district lines in the 

              wake of the 2000 census. The National Committee for an Effective 

              Congress (the nation's oldest and most effective liberal political 

              action committee) has been working flat-out on the state-by-state 

              redistricting process for months. Says the group's veteran director 

              Russ Hemenway of the battle for the House: "When all the new lines 

              are drawn and depending on how the courts eventually decide expected 

              challenges, in the end the Democrats will do no better than break 

              even or lose up to 20 seats." </p>

            <p>Even though it ought to be clear to anyone with half a brain that 

              Al Gore blew his chances with his smarmy, inconsistent flip-flopping--failing 

              to carry either his home state of Tennessee or Clinton's native 

              Arkansas, for example--some non-Green Naderites worry that an all-out 

              attack on the Democrats now would only magnify Nader's image with 

              some liberals as a "spoiler." As one senior Nader strategist puts 

              it: "Most of the enviros are mad at Ralph--some people didn't want 

              him to rub salt in their wounds." </p>

            <p>Moreover, Nader habitually has a long gestation period (witness 

              the crippling late start to his 2000 campaign, which sent out its 

              first direct-mail fundraising letter so tardily that returns didn't 

              start to come in until last July). "Ralph always plays his cards 

              close to the vest," says one key adviser. "And after a tough, rigorous 

              campaign, he needed recuperation time--he is, after all, 66." </p>

            <p>There's also the major problem of how to approach and deal with 

              the Greens, with whom Nader has had a sometimes-prickly relationship. 

              Local Green parties vary tremendously from state to state. The culture 

              of the Greens is still heavily impregnated with what one might call 

              a politically vegan disdain for electoral politics. And in some 

              states the leaders from this mindset are reluctant to turn over 

              the party apparatus to the scads of freshly minted Nader campaign 

              cadres from 2000, regardless of their enthusiasm, energy and skills. 

              The Greens need to decide whether they want to become a truly alternative 

              electoral force, one that could in many places decide the balance 

              of power and help discipline the Democrats into abandoning their 

              money-dominated drift into corporate centrism, and thus begin the 

              process of realigning American politics to the left. </p>

            <p>Especially with Jesse Jackson's co-optation by the Clinton White 

              House and the Gore campaign, his cozying up to Wall Street, and 

              his self-destruction by using Rainbow/PUSH funds to pay off his 

              pregnant mistress, Nader is still the most visible and valuable 

              asset of the real left (as opposed to the "left" in the debased, 

              <i>Crossfire</i> sense of the term). And there's a real danger that 

              well-meaning liberals will, in the wake of the Florida debacle, 

              skew the national debate to one about process (electronic scanners 

              versus chads, weekend and computer voting, and the like) rather 

              than the more fundamental one about power--the corrupting influence 

              of wealth and corporate control of governance, a systemic critique 

              that Nader is uniquely positioned to make and which was the groundbreaking 

              hallmark of his national campaign. </p>

            <p>To galvanize an organization, one top Naderite told me, "there 

              either has to be an issue or the recruitment of credible and attractive 

              Green candidates around whom people can be mobilized." Another Nader 

              adviser says, "Ralph really has only two choices: shut up or build 

              the Green Party." </p>

            <p>At this point, it's obvious that Nader has not yet firmly fixed 

              his course. "I've been trying to encourage the Green Party to establish 

              a national presence, a lobbying office, here in Washington," Nader 

              says, "and to help recruit hundreds of candidates in 2002--we had 

              over 260 in 2000, and we want over 1,000 in 2002." He adds: "The 

              students have prepared an initiative to establish 900 campus Green 

              chapters--we had 900 campus coordinators last year. I've been on 

              six or seven campuses since the campaign--there's lots of energy--it's 

              like the '60s, very alive." </p>

            <p>But while Nader says he will establish a new national organization 

              to do lobbying and issue mobilization, this new organization as 

              yet has no name, no director, no set agenda, and--rather astonishingly--it 

              will not be a membership group. While Nader says he has "been doing 

              local fundraisers for the Greens--that's the best way to recruit 

              new members, and it's easier to get local press," in fact he has 

              only done two of them (in Providence and Hartford). He says his 

              new group will be announced several months hence, as will his plans 

              in relation to the Green Party. "Wait for the spring--the time of 

              rebirth," he chuckles. He also envisions a series of major rallies--but 

              the first one won't be until July. </p>

            

<p>In the hard-nosed real world of electoral politics and communications, 

              however, timing is everything. Hamlets don't last long in national 

              politics--just ask Mario Cuomo. And the attention span of the electorate 

              is a notoriously short one. If Nader does not make up his mind soon 

              about what he should do, there's a real danger he will have missed 

              his moment, if he hasn't already.</p>
