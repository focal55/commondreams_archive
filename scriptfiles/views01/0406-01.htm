E.J. Dionne Jr., who some years back penned a brilliant book titled, 

              &quot;Why Americans Hate Politics,&quot; joined me for a round of 

              visits to election night parties Tuesday. And I think it&#146;s 

              fair to say he found a lot to love in the way Madison does politics.

<P>Dionne, who earlier in the day had delivered the University of 

              Wisconsin School of Journalism&#146;s Nafzinger Lecture, enjoys 

              election nights, as any good political reporter does. And we had 

              a fine night, running into likely candidates for governor -- Attorney 

              General Jim Doyle and Dane County Executive Kathleen Falk -- dozens 

              of state and local officials, labor leaders and a healthy cross-section 

              of Madison political characters.</P>

<P>Dionne was appropriately intrigued by <a href="http://www.newparty.org/pd/Home.html">Progressive Dane&#146;s</a> party 

              at the Orpheum Theatre. What better place to get a taste of Madison&#146;s 

              distinctive politics than at a victory party for what may well be 

              the most successful homegrown political party in the United States?</P>

<P>As outgoing District 5 Ald. Jose Sentmanat told Dionne, &quot;This 

              is a great night for PD.&quot; Every single Progressive Dane-endorsed 

              candidate won, and the party/movement flexed its electoral muscle 

              as never before. In the city&#146;s three most tightly contested 

              City Council races, Progressive Dane-endorsed candidates -- newcomers 

              Brenda Konkel in the 2nd, Jessy Tolkan in the 5th and Todd Jarrell 

              in the 8th -- easily prevailed over contenders of more moderate 

              Democratic or Republican stripes. Those wins mean that Progressive 

              Dane now has eight council members who are committed to its activist 

              social and economic justice agenda -- a record total.</P>

<P>Especially satisfying for Progressive Dane was Jarrell&#146;s landslide 

              victory over incumbent Ald. Mike Staude in the student-dominated 

              8th. Staude got himself in a load of trouble with the PD crew by 

              cozying up to bar owners, landlords and other business interests. 

              This spring, Staude threw everything he had at Jarrell, including 

              last-minute ads attacking the challenger for having backed Green 

              Ralph Nader over Al Gore in last fall&#146;s election. But Progressive 

              Dane, which has been working closely with the Greens, countered 

              with a grass-roots, issue-oriented campaign that dispatched Staude 

              by a 2-1 margin.</P>

<P>Progressive Dane also played a critical role in electing Shwaw 

              Vang to the Madison School Board. Vang, the first Hmong to win local 

              elected office, faced an equally able and appealing opponent, Teresa 

              Tellez-Giron. In a contest between a pair of newcomers with little 

              money, the dozens of Progressive Dane activists who delivered more 

              than 25,000 Vang leaflets to doors across town have to be seen as 

              a critical factor in the race -- as was the presence of Progressive 

              Dane stalwart and all-around good guy Andy Heidt as Vang&#146;s 

              campaign manager.</P>

<P>As Dionne said when we walked away from the Orpheum, &quot;There&#146;s 

              so much talk about how young people are disengaged from politics, 

              but here you&#146;ve got all these people in their 20s working on 

              campaigns, running campaigns.&quot; Dionne wondered whether the 

              Madison model for independent progressive politics could be reproduced 

              nationally.</P>

<P>He&#146;s a good journalist and that&#146;s a good question. There&#146;s 

              no doubt that unique political factors -- a progressive tradition, 

              a highly energized multigenerational activist community, a large 

              student population -- have aided Progressive Dane&#146;s rise. But 

              similar groups allied with the New Party have made breakthroughs 

              in Missoula, Little Rock and other towns; the Greens are in charge 

              of Santa Monica and several other California cities; Vermont&#146;s 

              independent Progressive Party is dominant in Burlington. In addition, 

              left-wing Democrats are pushing the limits of their party in San 

              Francisco, Los Angeles, Seattle, Minneapolis and dozens of smaller 

              cities.</P>

<P>I am convinced that issue-based, grass-roots progressive politics 

              represent a vital force in American politics -- posing a serious 

              and necessary challenge to the rightward drift of the national Democratic 

              Party. And I&#146;m glad I got a chance to show one of the finest 

              political writers in the country how that force is reshaping Madison 

              politics.
