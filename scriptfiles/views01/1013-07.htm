President Bush told us that this war would be like one we’d never seen; so 

far it looks a lot like all the other wars. I don’t mean just our maneuvers 

and operations: send in the bombs, break the rocks up smaller and smaller, 

then the special forces to slit the throats of the few goats left alive 

before the infantry rolls in to manage an uneasy peace, occupation or 

otherwise. I mean that the basic premise is the same as it ever was: Send in 

our killers to kill their killers.



<p>Sticks, rocks, spears, swords, bows, guns, bombs; the same military pageant 

we’ve seen put on time after time, by nation after nation in book after book 

and film after film. It’s not hard to imagine one of our F-18s 

fighter-bombers taking off from its carrier for another sortie over the low 

hills. It’s not hard to imagine because our TVs and movies have shown us, 

and our newspapers are centerfolds of just what war-making technology the 

enemy can expect.



<p>Imagine the soldier or group of soldiers who eventually find bin Laden 

trembling in a cave, or stuffed into a car trunk trying to flee across the 

border. Would it be like nabbing Hitler (finally!)? What then? Bring him 

back to the States in chains? Place him in stocks at Ground Zero and pelt 

him with rotten produce? Death by a thousand cuts? No, if he’s taken alive 

we should try him in open court, accord him his due process, not because he 

deserves it; he doesn’t deserve any such thing. We should accord him due 

process because it is part of who we are; we’ll not do it for him, we’ll do 

it for ourselves.



<p>Our president keeps throwing around the word “evil.” They are evil, he says, 

we are good. Such easy distinctions are a panacea for small minds. Has the 

United States ever been guilty of comparable evil to that perpetrated on 

September 11? In a constitutional republic, such questions can never be 

inappropriate, despite what government mouthpieces might suggest. This is 

not a time to shy away from difficult issues, but to confront them head on: 

Has the government of the United States ever supported, directly or 

indirectly, such terror? The answer would have to be yes. It may have been 

done for a variety of reasons and even with the best of intentions, but this 

fact remains: innocent men, women, children have suffered and been murdered, 

families have been destroyed and mothers and fathers wept because of our 

policies.



<p>Over the last weeks in my country there has been an outpouring of grief 

unlike anything I’ve ever seen; in our papers, our magazines, our television 

shows. It is painful to recognize that, in the past, our government has been 

the cause of such grief in others. This is not to suggest, of course, that 

we should forego our pursuit of the terrorists and their networks, only to 

provide some much needed context as our media and politicians continue in 

what seems to be permanent high dudgeon.



<p>Do we have other options? Could Osama bin Laden have possibly expected 

anything other than a military response? From what I have read and seen, bin 

Laden is not a man who wants peace. Bin Laden wants war, which is exactly 

what we are determined to give him. Would it disappoint him if we tried 

something else?



<p>Gandhi was once asked if non-violence could work against a man like Hitler. 

He was not sure; there would be loss, he replied, there would be suffering. 

But, he continued, is there not loss and suffering under the current method?



<p>Passive resistance is an inaccurate term to describe the methods of Gandhi 

and  Martin Luther King, Jr. Their goal was to use nonviolence to confront 

the perpetrators of violence with the perpetrator’s  own inhumanity, to show 

him a picture of himself that he could not bear. Could this work with bin 

Laden? Perhaps not; he believes God is rooting for him. But an innovative 

non-military strategy could work to win the essential support of the Islamic 

world, perhaps shrink the pool of volunteers from which bin Laden draws his 

willing agents. Unfortunately, with every bomb that’s dropped on 

Afghanistan, that pool becomes larger. After thousands of years of human 

existence, we’re still using sticks and stones to settle our disputes. It’s 

time for something new.
