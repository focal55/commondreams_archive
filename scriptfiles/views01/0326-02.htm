The growing conflict between the logic of the marketplace and the duty of

journalism is one of the most important issues of our times, but you would

never know it from the media coverage. That kind of disconnect between public

interest and media coverage is a perfect example of why the flow of

information should not be determined by market logic.

<P>

   News media are to a society what sensory perceptions are to an individual;

they provide information necessary to accurately assess our situation and act

accordingly. As global citizens, we are best served by a wide and varied flow

of information. But media properties increasingly are coming under corporate

control and the resulting pressure to turn big profits for stockholders often

trumps their journalistic obligations.

<P>



The increasing tension between the forces of mammon and those of the

messenger Mercury has been a growing concern of media critics across the

ideological spectrum. There is an inherent conflict of interest between

commodified information and democracy. But concern about that conflict had

been confined to ruminations in op-ed pages or academic conferences.

<P>

   All of that changed recently when Jay T. Harris, publisher of the San Jose

Mercury News, resigned his post to protest corporate ownership's profit

targets.

<P>

   Harris, a 30-year veteran of the news business, has worked as a reporter,

editor, academic and corporate executive. He was one of the highest-ranking

African-American newspaper executives in the nation. According to the American

Journalism Review, he also was considered the heir apparent to Knight Ridder

CEO Tony Ridder. Harris' resignation stunned the newspaper industry and

brought the issue of corporate profits versus journalistic integrity into the

open.

<P>

   "Much greater priority is given today to the business aspects of our

enterprise than is given to fulfilling our public trust," Harris wrote in his

letter of resignation to top executives at Knight Ridder, the corporate parent

of the Mercury News. "I fear as well that we no longer sense the same level of

`moral obligation' to `excel in all that we do' and that our founders'

commitment to publishing `high-quality' newspapers' is no longer the powerful

drive in the company that it once was."

<P>

   The 52-year-old Harris spent some of his early years in the Chicago area as

an assistant dean at Northwestern University's Medill School of Journalism. He

was a national correspondent and columnist for the Gannett News Service and

became the first black executive editor of the Philadelphia Daily News. In

1988, he moved on to Knight Ridder's corporate staff and was vice president of

operations when he left in 1994 to become publisher of the Mercury News in

California's then-booming Silicon Valley. The paper experienced remarkable

growth during his tenure.

<P>

   In other words, Harris is no starry-eyed idealist pushing impractical

stratagems. He is a newspaper veteran with a solid grounding in the corporate

realities of contemporary media. Harris is respected by most journalists and

he is also considered a "company man" and loyal corporate soldier.

<P>

   In his letter of resignation, however, he wrote that corporate budget

demands could result in "significant and lasting harm to the Mercury News as a

journalistic enterprise." He wrote that he feared the corporation was placing

too much focus on economic concerns at the expense of high-quality journalism,

and thus the paper's role as a public trust.

<P>

   Many in the industry quietly share Harris' fears--and for good reason. The

slumping economy has put a financial squeeze on newspapers across the country.

Advertising revenue and profits are down while newsprint costs are soaring.

Since most media companies are publicly traded corporations, they are just as

susceptible to the laws of the market as is any other company seeking to

attract investment funds. The higher their earnings the more attractive they

are.

<P>

   There has always been a creative tension between newspapers' business

interests and their journalistic obligations, but most mainstream publications

have managed to maintain a workable balance--although there are many critics

who insist that business interests have always determined media coverage. The

justification for funding non-profit media institutions like public radio and

television was that they provided a sanctuary, of sorts, from the compelling

tug of the marketplace.

<P>

   As Harris' resignation makes clear, that tug is more powerful than ever.
