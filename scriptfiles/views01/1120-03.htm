THE UNITED States stands for disagreement. This is where the famous words, ''I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it,'' are reaffirmed each day.

<P>





<P>Public conversation swings from Maya Angelou to Jerry Springer. Presidents are habitually roasted on Saturday Night Live. Even Al Gore tells Al Gore jokes. We do not worship sacred cows. This is the land of the free and the home of the opinionated. </P>







<P>Terrorism shouldn't change this. The Sept. 11 attacks lacerated the country. But they are not an excuse to muzzle public speech.  </P>







<P>Bill Maher, host of television's ''Politically Incorrect,'' called the military ''cowardly'' for firing long-range missiles. Columnist Ann Coulter wrote after the terrorist attacks, ''kill their leaders and convert them to Christianity.'' These comments can sting, even insult. But they are signs of a healthy democracy. </P>







<P>Only fanatics demand lock-step conformity. So it's disappointing to read a new report from the American Council of Trustees and Alumni claiming that ''college and university faculty have been the weak link in America's response to the attack.'' </P>







<P>The offenses: ''... many faculty demurred'' from condemning the attacks. ''Some refused to make judgments. Many invoked tolerance and diversity as antidotes to evil. Some even pointed accusatory fingers, not at the terrorists, but at America itself.'' Included is a McCarthyesque list of professors' names and comments. </P>







<P>The report calls for more of a focus on western civilization and criticizes schools that have added courses on Islam because this ''reinforced the mindset that it was America - and America's failure to understand Islam - that were to blame.''</P>







<P>We disagree. </P>







<P>Professors are complaining and getting away with it? Great. It means Americans are not the Taliban. We let people talk. </P>







<P>More courses on Islam? Wonderful. Pursuing knowledge is not casting blame on anything except, possibly, ignorance. </P>







<P>More attention on western civilization? Terrific. But the schools whose faculty are criticized in the report already offer many such classes. For example, professors at the University of North Carolina were criticized. But the school has several  sections of ''History of Western Civilization to 1650'' that go from Plato to Charlemagne to Martin Luther.</P>







<P>And though it's called ultra-liberal, the University of California at Berkeley offers ''Origins of Western Civilization'' and classes on ancient Greece, ancient Rome, and European and American history. </P>







<P>Praise the critics and contrarians for teaching this lesson: A free society doesn't just accommodate dissenters; it thrives on them. </P>
