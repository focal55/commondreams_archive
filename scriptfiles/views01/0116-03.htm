<p>On Sept. 23, 1999, at the Citadel Military College in South Carolina, president-elect George W. Bush made this statement: "I know that the best defense can be a strong and swift offense."<BR>

<br>

"Our military," he continued, "requires more than good treatment. It needs the rallying point of a defining mission. And that mission is to deter wars - and win wars when deterrence fails."<BR>

<br>

The "defense" vision Bush presented to his Citadel audience rests on familiar <IMG align=left hspace=14 vspace=14 SRC=images/seanlogo.jpg WIDTH=94 HEIGHT=124 BORDER=0>but often unnoticed assumptions - assumptions that go unchallenged even by so-called policy experts. So it's interesting, to put it mildly, to see what's revealed when these assumptions are brought into the light of day.<BR>

<br>

It's a worthwhile exercise, given that, even at the beginning of a new millennium (having just concluded the bloodiest of all centuries in human history), the planet is still ravaged by systematic carnage.<BR>

<br>

According to the conservative think tank, the National Defense Council Foundation, 68 conflicts currently plague the globe. The more liberal research group, Center for Defense Information, counts 39 wars across the planet, compared to 37 a year ago. CIA numbers are slightly lower, tallying 31 conflicts worldwide.<BR>

<br>

With such a mind-numbing amount of violence infecting Earth, protests and pronouncements of pacifism from the peace movement must seem utopian to our military planners and their "patriotic" supporters. This, however, says more about the power of indoctrination than it does about the theory and practice of nonviolent social struggle. <BR>

<br>

A study of Gandhi and King - the two most prominent nonviolent practitioners of the 20th century - will find that nonviolent resistance does not reject the use of power or seek to abolish it, as Machiavellian "realists" claim.<BR>

<br>

In fact, as Gene Sharp has pointed out, it recognizes power as inherent to all social relationships, and that the control of power is the central problem in political theory and reality.<BR>

<br>

"Basically, there appear to be two views of the nature of power. One can see people as dependent upon the good will, the decisions and the support of their government or any other hierarchical system to which they belong. Or, conversely, one can see that government or system dependent on the people's good will, decisions and support," Sharp wrote in his classic 1973 work "The Politics of Nonviolent Action."<BR>

<br>

Nonviolent theory sides with the second of these views, highlighting a forgotten truism: the source of all political power is the obedience and cooperation of its subjects. The ability of even totalitarian tyrannies to operate successfully is significantly influenced by whether or not the general population voluntarily supports the system or disrupts its operation.<BR>

<br>

The truth behind that statement cannot be overemphasized. And if you meditate on it for a while, the radical ramifications will almost certainly startle you, as it has political thinkers from Hobbes to Hegel to Walter Lippmann; an idea that been kept safely away from the rabble.<BR>

<br>

It's tempting to think the threat of superior physical violence will always win, but that clearly isn't the case. Say a group of engineers were threatened by state authorities: "Unless you build holocaust ovens, you will be killed." The dictator is powerless and without ovens should the engineers withhold consent, and are willing to suffer, as they most certainly will, given the predictable response of state officials to disobedience.<BR>

<br>

In the words of military historian Lt. Col. D.J. Goodspeed, "no government can function long without a certain necessary minimum of popular support and cooperation."<BR>

<br>

To make it explicit, the Bush argument assumes that peace and freedom must ultimately be established and defended with violence. The historical record is full of examples otherwise.<BR>

<br>

For example, in 1944 dictatorships in Guatemala and El Salvador collapsed under the force of nonviolent tactics. This historical fact not only calls into question Bush's banal assumptions, it dispels the false notion that even if nonviolent methods work, they take a long time to be effective.<BR>

<br>

Next week we'll explore this subject a little further. But for now, consider this: a nation whose citizens are thoroughly trained and committed to the discipline of nonviolent engagement cannot be "taken over" by a would-be dictator because any military coup d'etat would fail without popular cooperation.<BR>

<br>

Such nonviolent war planning may not enrich the arms industry but it's certainly a more rational defense than nuclear weapons for a people who are truly interested in peace. Dictators are powerless over those who refuse to obey. There is no better defense I can imagine. Can you?</p>
