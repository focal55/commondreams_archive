I didn't see the initial crash of the towers, but from the streets outside

my apartment here in Jersey City, I could look across the Hudson to the

smoke and char billowing in the air and stare in unbelief at the striking

absence of those landmarks so usually dominant in our vision.



<p>Many in my neighborhood took the PATH subway to the World Trade Center

station every day and many of them would never come back.  The sick irony of

the hate involved in the attack was underscored as a makeshift memorial -

one of a seeming infinity erected throughout the New York region - appeared

at our station, its list of names dominated by the Arabic dead from our

heavily Middle Eastern and South Asia neighborhood.



<p>How can progressives respond to September 11?



<p>With pain, with horror, with sympathy, with pride, with all the regrets of

what could have been.  But most importantly not with its usual defensive

stance of saying just "no", for out of the horror of that day are also the

possibilities of a new sense of humanity in the world that progressives

should embrace as the positive solution to prevent further tragedies.



<p>While we should worry and act proactively to defend civil liberties and

promote international justice as an alternative to military means of

security, it is worth emphasizing the positive sides that our society

revealed in these crisis days, some of them directly the result of the

political and cultural organizing progressives have been promoting for

years. I say all this not to paint a pure rosy picture, since we may have

some grim days ahead, but to emphasize the gains we have achieved by our

constant engagement with these issues over the years. There is so much good

we can appeal to in our fellow citizens, so we should not frame our response

totally in a "ten minutes to midnight" approach.



<p>Despite some horrible acts by individual Americans, the major media and

politicians have been dramatically less xenophobic than during past

terrorist acts in the US, with continual admonitions against turning hate

against fellow Americans, especially Arab and Islamic Americans. Despite the

justified anger at the death and destruction, there has been a heartening

lack of scapegoating and an understanding promoted of the diversity of what

Islam means and the humane components of the Palestinian struggle which

overwhelmingly reject this act of mass murder. This is a remarkable advance

on the xenophobia that absolutely dominated all discussion of terrorism and

the Middle East even a few years ago.



<p>In speaking of these events, we need to remember that in times of crisis

communication is not always about what is intended but what will be heard

and understood by listeners. When bodies lie barely cold in the rubble of

mass death, no explanation, no "perspective", on the causes of the event are

likely to be heard or should expected to be heard as anything other than an

excuse for the murder. That is a reality that has to be part of any

responsible left response to these tragic events.



<p>In that sense, anything said must be clearly put in the context of absolute

and unequivocal condemnation of these mass murders and of the criminality of

those involved.



<p>While the US has its own international crimes for which it should be held

accountable, they are irrelevant to these events, for there is no calculus

that allows the grievances of one set of innocents to be taken out on the

bodies of another set.



<p>This reality is why the Palestinian leadership condemned it so strongly

without any reference to US actions, an act of amazing compassion

considering this was done even as their people were being killed with

weapons and by allies of the US. As was reported by Reuters, the Palestinian

leadership stated that the attack contravened ''all human principles and

values regardless of the existing differences with the American

administration.'' Arafat himself told reporters, "We completely condemn this

serious operation. ... We were completely shocked. It's an unbelievable

disaster. It is touching our hearts. It is very difficult to explain my

feelings. God help them. God help them.''



<p>No one wants to hear about past mistakes right now that this tragedy has

occurred (since that just doubles the bitterness), but everyone wants to

hear about solutions to prevent a similar tragedy in the future. The Right

is coding their explanation and scapegoating in their proposed solution -

military response - implicitly (and in a few cases explicitly) blaming too

little military spending and too lax repression for the events of September

11.



<p>Conversely, instead of discussing past crimes by the US government, a better

approach is to stress solutions for the future - collective security through

global justice.  We can act in solidarity with the Palestinians and the

other victims of US violence by strongly emphasizing the evil of all

violence bred of hate, domination and exploitation. We will find far more

allies for a just world through building solidarity between the victims of

the World Trade Center and other global victims of violence than through any

finger-pointing or causal explanations.



<p>There has been a surprisingly large amount of acknowledgement of the

suffering of the Palestinians and other victims of US military actions in

these weeks, both in the media and in the public. The very enormity of this

act that may be encouraging war fever in some has through its enormity also

focusing many Americans on the world of misery they often ignored.



<p>Maybe that is a justification for the effectiveness of the act of the

terrorists, but it is the traditional religious explanation justifying all

evil - that when we confront evil in its raw singular hateful reality, we

may be inspired to find the good within in reaction. That is never

guaranteed, but when peoples' hearts are opened at such a moment, we may

find that an appeal for humanity and love may be far more effective than a

more traditional oppositional stance.



<p>People will hate only if they feel that is the only solution to the wound

that was opened in them.  If we can provide an alternative solution, of

solidarity between all victims of violence and hate, of ending misery so

hate cannot breed, of seeking a real end to war and violence through

democratic and global collective security, that is I think the truest way to

serve both the victims of this September 11 and the victims of US violence

as well.
