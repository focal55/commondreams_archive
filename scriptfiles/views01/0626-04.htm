Conservatives in general and right-wing Republican politicians in particular love to cry ``class warfare'' and ``liberal bias'' whenever a social critic or a media pundit claims that a particular policy favors the wealthy over the middle class or corporations over the environment. But perhaps it's time for conservatives to drop the convenient media and academic scapegoats and take up their beef directly with the American people. 

<P>



   A New York Times/CBS News poll of 1,050 adults in the United States conducted in mid-June seems to suggest that the public decidedly shares the critics' view of the biases in the Bush administration's policies.

<P>



   The most shocking finding concerns the public's views on how the administration's policies affect the various classes. By a landslide, the American people believe Bush policies favor the rich. The United States has long prided itself as the world's preeminent middle-class nation, yet Americans by a seven to one margin think current policies favor the rich rather than the middle class. George W. Bush ran on a platform of ``compassionate conservatism,'' which to many people implied a decent level of concern for the plight of the poor, but virtually no one thinks current policies favor the poor. Overall, 8 percent of the American people believe the administration's policies favor the middle class, 2 percent say they favor the poor, 57 say they favor the rich, 27 percent say all classes are equally favored and 6 percent have no opinion.

<P>Bush's approval ratings have dropped.

<P>



   These poll numbers and others indicate that during its short time in office, the administration has managed to show what it means to have government of the rich, by the rich and for the rich -- and the American people don't like it very much. 

<P>



   Take the recent tax cut, the president's proudest achievement and a huge giveaway to the wealthy. Only 28 percent of the Americans surveyed agreed that the surplus should have been used to cut taxes, while 64 percent would have liked it to be spent on Social Security and Medicare.

<P>



   But it's the environment that is emerging as the clearest area of contrast between the narrow, corporate agenda pursued by the administration and the wishes of the majority. While Americans by a 55 to 29 percent margin say protecting the environment is more important to them than producing energy, 71 percent believe producing energy is more important to the president, while only 12 percent say protecting the environment is more important to Bush. 

<P>



   More than two-thirds of the people (68 percent) of the people believe energy conservation should be a priority compared to 21 percent that believe fossil fuel production should be a priority. In other words, the vast majority of Americans want an energy policy setting priorities that are exactly the opposite of the energy policy the administration has proposed.

<P>



     Not surprisingly, the president's approval ratings have dropped. Can this president, who lost the popular vote, regain even the relative popularity he once had?

<P>



      Bush's recent threat to veto bipartisan Patients' Bill of Rights legislation doesn't augur well. Seven out of 10 Americans favor a Patient's Bill of Rights. By continuing to fight to water down the bill and raising the specter of a veto, the administration once again will be perceived as favoring the interests of the despised HMOs over those of the average person. 

<P>



   Public rejection of administration policies suggests that the 2000 election may have been more about the rejection of a candidate than about the endorsement of a philosophy of government. Rather than elect Al Gore, Americans were willing to swallow conservatism as long as it was tempered with compassion. Now Americans are choking on the raw conservatism unseasoned by compassion that the current administration has been serving instead.
