<p>&nbsp;WE WERE arguing about the f-word.

</P>

<P>  My friend Jason told me not to use it. He said it turns people off and gets 

in the way of everything I'm trying to accomplish.

</P>

<P>  "I don't understand," he said, "why you have to call yourself a 'feminist.' 

"

</P>

<P>  Many friends cringe at the label. "Feminist." It conjures up the Ugly 

Feminist, the infamous, anti-Barbie, man-hating, bra-burning, bitter ghost of 

feminist past -- an image that haunts those of us born after the civil rights 

movement.

</P>

<P>  In the history of feminism, so far as we know, no one ever burned a bra. In 

1968 in Atlantic City, during a demonstration against the Miss America Pageant,

</P>

<P>women threw bras and curlers into a garbage can. These weren't burned, but 

some news accounts described a fire, perhaps because reporters made an 

association with draft-card burning in protests against the Vietnam War.

</P>

<P>  It's no coincidence that our most enduring image of feminism is a 

caricature of something that didn't happen. Distorting and devaluing the word 

"feminism," continues a long tradition of trivializing women's accomplishments.

</P>

<P>  Young women ought to feel pride and gratitude for the women who came before 

us -- Susan B. Anthony and right to vote; Margaret Sanger and birth control; 

Gloria Steinem and more equality in the institution of marriage.

</P>

<P>  But the Ugly Feminist eclipses our real history. Her spooky image sends a 

warning: Women seeking equality are inherently unattractive.

</P>

<P>  This message is haunting. One of the few ways young women are allowed to 

experience power or be celebrated in our culture is through their beauty and 

sexuality. To warn women they risk losing attractiveness if they vie for some 

other kind of power is yet another way, and an effective one, to keep women in 

their place.

</P>

<P>  The women's movement inadvertently perpetuated the Ugly Feminist image by 

attacking icons of bimbohood like Barbie, the doll. In a struggle to get the 

culture to value women for their brains and accomplishments and not just their 

looks, some feminists pigeonholed Barbie as anti-feminist. It was easy to fall 

into that trap. Barbie is a doll, after all, with torpedo breasts, a tiny 

waist, and curled feet -- as if always ready to slip into a pair of Jimmy Choo 

spikes.

</P>

<P>  But seeing Barbie only for her body is buying into a male point of view, 

not a little girl's.

</P>

<P>  Barbie was our childhood heroine. This isn't because girls are naturally 

drawn to all things pink and prissy. It's because we took what the culture 

gave us. Being creative and resourceful, we made do. Now, as adults, we don't 

want our Barbies misunderstood.

</P>

<P>  In "Manifesta," their book on young feminism, Jennifer Baumgardner and Amy 

Richards write, "Barbie didn't so much influence us as that she was a blank 

screen on which to project what was happening in our heads."

</P>

<P>  More often than not, we hacked off that famous blond hair. When Barbie's 

friend Skipper almost drowned in the Barbie Jacuzzi, Nurse Barbie pulled her 

out and administered CPR.

</P>

<P>  I don't know of a Barbie that wasn't curious and sexually adventurous, 

sometimes resulting in, as with Jennifer Baumgardner's doll, Barbie getting an 

abortion.

</P>

<P>  Even more than Barbie, I loved "Charlie's Angels" on television. I was so 

inspired by the female trio that when I was 9, I wrote a novel (118 pages 

typed) based on what I imagined Cheryl Ladd's character, Kris Monroe, had been 

like as an intrepid child.

</P>

<P>  When "Charlie's Angels" was written off as "Jiggle TV," the perceptions of 

girl fans were ignored once again. Attributing the show's success to T&A also 

trivialized the groundbreaking success of the women who starred in a hit 

series, commanded high salaries and were featured on the cover of Time 

magazine.

</P>

<P>  Too many young women don't realize this battle has been fought before. 

Steinem, criticized for wearing miniskirts, has said that in her early years 

as a feminist she set herself up against the suffragettes. She believed the 

same old hype that they were all anti-sex, puritanical types. Only later did 

she learn about sexually liberated anarchist Emma Goldman or 19th century 

presidential candidate Victoria Woodhull and her Free Love Party.

</P>

<P>  I look forward to the day when women make it to the cover of Time as often 

as men do, not just as actresses or models, but as world leaders. But that 

won't happen as long as we keep recycling images of Ditzy Barbie and Ugly 

Feminist, flip sides of the same coin. When young women use the f-word and 

call themselves feminists, these anachronisms will dissolve, like the Wicked 

Witch when Dorothy dumped a bucket of water on her.
