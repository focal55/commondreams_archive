<p>On Inauguration Day 2001, standing on the steps of the State Capitol just a 

few blocks from the governor's mansion that George W. Bush recently had 

vacated, about 1,000 Austin residents raised their hands as I administered 

a Citizens' Oath of Office:



<p>"I do solemnly pledge that I will faithfully execute the office of citizen 

of the United States, and that I will, to the best of my ability, resist 

corporate control of the world, resist militarism, resist the roll-back of 

civil rights, and resist illegitimate authority in all its forms."



<p>Bush's inauguration in Washington earlier that day made it clear to all of 

us that whatever radical and progressive political organizing we had done 

during the eight noxious years of the "New Democrat" administration of 

Clinton must be intensified during the toxic four years to come under a 

Bush administration.



<p>The possibilities for that organizing were plainly visible from looking at 

the range of people in the spirited, noisy and passionate crowd -- from 

Democrats to the Radical Anarchist Marching Band. On the platform, 

representatives of the NAACP and Green Party, the American Civil Liberties 

Union and University of Texas Radical Action Network, the National 

Organization for Women and International Socialist Organization, all spoke 

to a common theme: the need to build a popular movement to challenge power 

and keep alive radical and progressive politics.



<p>While many in the crowd voted for Al Gore, there was a consensus that a 

Democratic Party which has moved so clearly and consistently to the right 

-- embracing reactionary domestic policies, such as Clinton's so-called 

welfare "reform" law, and pursuing brutal and inhumane foreign policy, such 

as the ongoing bombing/sanctions policy toward Iraq -- is not going to be 

at the forefront of a progressive movement.



<p>In Austin we chanted, "He's not my president." But I also said that if Gore 

had been elected, for me the chant would have been the same. The 

politicians of both major parties who have surrendered the promise of real 

democracy to corporate interests will never be leaders of the people.



<p>If Bush is not our president, and Gore wouldn't have been either, the 

question is clear: Who can be our leader?



<p>At that moment, I asked the people in the crowd to turn to the person next 

to them, then turn to the other side, and then to look at themselves. If 

our movements are to be truly popular movements, leadership will come from 

us. It will be diffuse. We will all, at some point and in some fashion, 

have to step forward to claim both the right and the obligation to lead.



<p>Popular movements don't search for leaders, they produce leaders. Such 

movements --  to abolish slavery, win labor organizing rights, end wars -- 

have won real gains for human freedom and justice, not because of leaders 

but because of the moral vision and courage of all the people who did not 

turn away from the struggle.



<p>The last phrase of the citizens' oath we took in Austin echoes the "Call to 

Resist Illegitimate Authority" issued in 1967 by Americans struggling to 

end their government's barbaric attack on the people of Vietnam. Those were 

grim times, certainly no less scary and threatening than the situation we 

face today. But people struggled, fought, resisted -- against the grain and 

against the odds.



<p>The powerful have added new weapons to their arsenals -- structural 

adjustment programs and World Trade Organization rules whose effects are as 

lethal as a B-52 bombing run. Just as their strategies for domination and 

control have "matured," so have our analyses and strategies for fighting back.



<p>But the essence of the struggle is unchanged, and our pledge should 

conclude with the same words as the 1967 pledge: "Now is the time to resist."
