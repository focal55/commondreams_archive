George W. Bush seems to be cruising through

the opening months of his presidency with dumb luck,

much as he won the office without even winning the

popular vote. But there is one arena in which he is

playing with fire, and is sure to get burned: he still

thinks that he can get away with privatizing our

Social Security system.



         <p>Mr. Bush managed to get through the election

without paying the price for stepping on the famed

"third rail" of American politics -- probably because

most people didn't know what he was proposing. In

fact, a Harvard study of the electorate showed that

most voters could not distinguish between Mr. Bush

and his Democratic opponent, Al Gore, on any of the

issues, with the possible exception of prescription

drugs for Medicare.



         <p>But Mr. Bush has now reaffirmed his

commitment to creating individual private retirement

accounts out of the existing Social Security system, a

radical idea that even Ronald Reagan would not have

dared to put forward. If he continues down this road,

it is only a matter of time before the public

understands the threat that this poses to their

retirement security, and Mr. Bush and his party will

pay a political price for it.



         <p>Privatization would threaten Social Security in

a number of ways. First, it would add some trillions

of dollars of costs to a system that is currently

financially sound for the foreseeable future. This

would build pressure for benefit cuts in the future,

and undermine people's confidence in the program.



         <p>The additional costs are of two types: first,

there is the cost of transition. The 45 million

Americans that receive a monthly check from Social

Security are being paid from the taxes of currently

employed workers. To take away one-sixth of this

revenue and put it into private accounts would create

a gap that must be filled somehow -- most likely with

benefit cuts.



         <p>Second, there are the administrative costs

associated with managing 144 million individual

accounts. These turn out to be enormous -- 15 or 20

times the costs of administering the current program,

and enough to eat up as much as 20 percent of the

eventual returns from these accounts.



         <p>Of course, what looks like waste from the

point of view of the public is income from someone

else's vantage point: the Wall Street firms who would

haul in billions of dollars of easy money from

managing the individual accounts.



         <p>And that's what this privatization effort is all

about, in a word: greed. It is an appeal not only to the

greed of Wall Street but to a small, militantly selfish

part of the electorate that is willing to rupture the

bonds of social solidarity that have made Social

Security this country's most successful anti-poverty

program. They want to break the commitment that

each generation has made to its predecessors for the

past 65 years: to provide a basic social safety net in

their old age.



         <p>The Bush Administration does not put it this

way, but the reasons put forth in support of

privatization are patently false. First and foremost is

the urban legend that Social Security needs to be

"fixed" because the baby boomers will bust the trust

fund when they retire. But anyone with a computer

and a modem can go to www.ssa.gov and see for

themselves that Social Security is perfectly solvent

without any changes for the next 36 years, even

assuming quite dismal economic growth.



         <p>For those who worry about the science-fiction

future, the same consensus numbers show that the

shortfall for the whole 75-year planning period is

quite small -- less than three-quarters of one percent

of our national income. And now Alan Greenspan has

pointed out that even this much-hyped and grossly

exaggerated shortfall -- which was never anything to

worry about -- might disappear as economists take

into account the faster productivity growth of recent

years.



         <p>Privatization, which would actually worsen

Social Security's financial solvency, has been sold as

a way of boosting the program by taking advantage of

the stock market's high returns. But here, too, there is

a false assumption: that stocks can deliver their

historic rate of return (on average, 7 percent after

inflation) regardless of how overvalued they are at the

starting point.



         <p>Guess again: the NASDAQ is down more than

50 percent from its peak last March. A lot of people

are already making changes in their retirement plans.

It seems that privatization is an idea whose time has

come -- and gone. George W. Bush would be wise to

take notice, and back off.
