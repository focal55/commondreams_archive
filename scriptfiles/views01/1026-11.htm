For some people, war is terror, disaster and death. For others, 

it's a PR problem.



<p>At the Rendon Group, a public-relations firm with offices in 

Boston and Washington, pleasant news arrived the other day with a $397,000 

contract to help the Pentagon look good while bombing Afghanistan. The 

four-month deal includes an option to renew through most of 2002.



<p>This is a job for savvy PR pros who know how to sound humanistic. 

"At the Rendon Group, we believe in people," says the company's mission 

statement, which expresses "our admiration and respect for cultural 

diversity" and proclaims a commitment to "helping people win in the global 

marketplace."



<p>A media officer at the Pentagon explained why Rendon got the 

contract. "We needed a firm that could provide strategic counsel 

immediately," Lt. Col. Kenneth McClellan said. "We were interested in 

someone that we knew could come in quickly and help us orient to the 

challenge of communicating to a wide range of groups around the world."



<p>As a PR outfit, Rendon has moved in some powerful economic 

circles, with clients including official trade agencies of the United 

States, Bulgaria, Russia and Uzbekistan. In Washington, the firm helped 

organize a series of conferences on "post-privatization management in the 

global telecommunications, electric power, oil and gas, banking and 

finance, and transportation sectors." Some of the clientele has been more 

liberal or touchy-feely: Handgun Control Inc. and the American Massage 

Therapy Association.



<p>Rendon proudly notes that it provided "community and media 

relations counsel to the Monsanto Chemical Company in its effort to clean 

up several contaminated sites." Overseas, Rendon helped the Kuwait 

Petroleum Corporation to cope with labor strife and bad press when closing 

a refinery in Naples, Italy.



<p>Some clients have been more shadowy. Rendon worked for the 

government of Kuwait in the early 1990s. And the firm made a lot of money 

by contracting with the CIA to do media work for the Iraqi National 

Congress, an organization seeking the overthrow of Saddam Hussein.



<p>Now, the Rendon Group is facing what is perhaps its most 

challenging project yet -- spinning for a war in Afghanistan. With its 

sights set on media content in 79 countries, Rendon will use standard tools 

of the PR trade, such as focus groups, websites and rigorous analysis of 

news coverage.



<p>Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld said that "we need to do a 

better job to make sure that people are not confused as to what this is 

about." It's typical of warmakers to claim that the biggest problems lie 

with others' faulty perceptions rather than their own deadly orders. But no 

amount of PR wizardry can change the cold facts: when a bomb hits a home 

for the elderly or a hospital or a residential neighborhood, or when a 

bombing campaign sets in motion a cataclysm of mass starvation.



<p>If some people are "confused" about this war, it may be because 

they remember the rationale for it: Killing thousands of civilians is 

unconscionable.



<p>Though you wouldn't know much about it from watching TV news or 

skimming the front pages, large numbers of Afghans -- many of them children 

and elderly -- are facing the likelihood of starvation because the bombing 

has forced recurrent halts to the movement of food-aid trucks from Pakistan 

into Afghanistan. Concern is growing among humanitarian aid workers that 

about 100,000 people are now in imminent peril. By winter, the number could 

be in the millions.



<p>Meanwhile, on television, we see footage of air-dropped meals that 

amount to no more than 1 percent of what's needed to prevent people from 

starving. That's called good PR.



<p>At this point, the playbook for the Pentagon's media game is a 

familiar one. Consider the words of Eugene Secunda, a professor of 

marketing and former senior vice president of the J. Walter Thompson firm. 

"Operation Desert Storm allowed only one view of the battle: the one 

authorized by the military," he observed in 1991. "Like travelers led from 

their buses by tour guides, the TV crews were given an opportunity to 

videotape the 'panoramic vista' before them, and then were whisked to the 

next officially authorized destination."



<p>Writing a decade ago, Secunda foreshadowed the kind of coverage 

we're now seeing. "In the aftermath of the war with Iraq, strategic 

planners, preparing for future wars, are unquestionably examining the 

lessons gleaned from this triumphant experience. One of the most important 

lessons learned is the necessity of mobilizing strong public support, 

through the projection of a powerful and tightly controlled PR program, 

with particular effort directed toward the realization of positive news 

coverage."



<p>As bombs routinely fall on Afghanistan, that's the kind of 

coverage that dominates television screens in the United States. For now, 

anyway, the Pentagon is winning its PR war at home.
