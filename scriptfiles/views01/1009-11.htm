When the bombing of Afghanistan resumed Monday night [Oct. 8], 

retired generals showed no fatigue at their posts under hot lights at 

network studios. On CNN, former NATO supreme commander Wesley Clark teamed 

up with Maj. Gen. Don Shepperd to explain military strategies; they were 

sharing their insights as employees of AOL Time Warner.



         <p>Far away, missiles are flying and bombs are exploding -- but in 

televisionland, a sense of equilibrium prevails. The tones are calm; the 

correspondents are self-composed. News bulletins crawl across the bottom of 

the screen, along with invitations to learn more. "Take a 3-D look at U.S. 

military aircraft at CNN.com."



         <p>At Pentagon briefings, carried live, the secretary of defense 

bears a chilling resemblance to a predecessor named McNamara. But the 

language of Donald Rumsfeld is thoroughly modern, foreshadowing a war 

without end: "In this battle against terrorism, there is no silver bullet." 

But there will be many bullets, missiles and bombs. We hear the customary 

assurances that air strikes will be surgical, and Rumsfeld echoes the 

metaphor: "Terrorism is a cancer on the human condition."



         <p>The reports about the bombing are laced with references to 

airborne food drops. Details have been sketchy. But self-congratulation has 

been profuse on television, now a free-fire zone for war propaganda.



         <p>Sunday night [Oct. 7], on "Larry King Live," a bipartisan panel of 

senators affirmed their loyalty to the president. The ranking GOP member of 

the Senate Armed Services Committee, a former secretary of the navy, 

illuminated our goodness. Sen. John Warner said: "This, I think, is the 

first time in contemporary military history where a military operation is 

being conducted against the government of a country, and simultaneously, 

with the troops carrying out their mission, other troops are trying to take 

care of the innocent victims who all too often are caught in harm's way."



         

<p>Hours after Warner's explanation of American saintliness, the UN's 

World Food Program halted its convoys of emergency aid to Afghanistan 

because of the bombing campaign. Meanwhile, private relief workers voiced 

escalating alarm. A news release, put out by my colleagues at the Institute 

for Public Accuracy (<a href="http://www.accuracy.org" target="_new">www.accuracy.org</a>), quoted the president of the 

humanitarian aid organization Conscience International, Jim Jennings: "Food 

drops from high altitudes alone absolutely cannot provide sufficient and 

effective relief that is urgently necessary to prevent mass starvation."



         <p>The U.S. government sent two C-17 planes to drop rations. 

Jennings, who has been involved in humanitarian work around the world for 

two decades, was not impressed. At a single camp inside Afghanistan, in 

Herat, "there are 600,000 people on the verge of starvation," he said. "If 

you provide one pound of food per day, the minimum for bare survival, it 

would take 500 planeloads a month to supply the one camp in Herat alone, 

and Afghanistan is the size of Texas. The administration has stated that 

two aircraft are being used for food relief so far -- for all of Afghanistan."



         <p>Avowedly, the main targets of the bombing are the people in the 

Bin Laden network. But the rhetorical salvoes will be understood, all too 

appropriately, in wider contexts. "We will root them out and starve them 

out," Rumsfeld said, just before closing a news conference with a ringing 

declaration: "We are determined not to be terrorized."



         <p>"That last quote says it all," MSNBC anchor Brian Williams 

interjected a moment later, before going to "NBC military analyst" Bernard 

Trainor, a former Marine Corps general. Like the other ex-generals on 

network payrolls, Trainor consistently uses the word "we" to describe U.S. 

military actions. ("We now have the capability...") High-tech maps and 

video graphics are profuse during the explications of war-game scenarios.



         <p>Former diplomats can play too. On NBC, Richard Holbrooke -- a 

media favorite who engineered the diplomatic runup to the bombing of 

Yugoslavia in spring 1999 -- chatted with Tom Brokaw while using a pointer 

and a bright-lit map to elucidate geopolitical dynamics.



         <p>Constantly crawling across TV screens, snippets of quotes blur 

together... Bin Laden saying that believers will triumph, Bush declaring 

"may God continue to bless America," the Taliban accusing the U.S. of 

"terrorist" attacks... As time goes on, the adversaries increasingly seem 

to be talking each other's language.



         <p>The on-screen logos, spangled in red-white-and-blue, exude pride 

in a nation resurgent. CBS has opted for "America Fights Back." NBC and 

MSNBC are using "America Strikes Back." At times, MSNBC switches to an 

alternate buzz phrase: "Homeland Defense."



         <p>Supposedly, bombing Afghanistan is going to make us safer back 

here in the USA. Yet hours after the attacks began on Oct. 7, the FBI 

called for heightened alerts across the United States -- because the risk 

of another deadly attack in this country had just increased. If war can be 

peace, why can't greater danger bring us greater security?



         <p>By Monday afternoon, networks were showing bombers taking off from 

aircraft carriers, en route to Afghanistan. MSNBC's viewers saw footage of 

warheads with "NYPD" scrawled on them; in the background, an American Flag 

fluttered on deck.



         <p>And so, a bait-and-switch process of patriotic imagery is near 

completion. For weeks, in the aftermath of the horrendous events of Sept. 

11, the public embraced Old Glory as a symbol of grief, human solidarity 

and love of country. Now the ubiquitous American Flag is being affixed to 

military means of destruction.



         <p>"This will be a long war," George W. Bush promised on Monday. From 

all indications, the TV networks are ready to do their part for the 

military operation that has been named Enduring Freedom. But far from the 

comforts of televisionland, many people will be enduring our freedom to kill.
