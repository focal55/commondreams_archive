Recent 

      statements and actions by top players within the Administration and its 

      shadow cabinet of unreconstructed Cold Warriors may just be trial balloons 

      to test the waters to see if anyone will object to a resumption of testing 

      and abbrogation of treaties subscribed to by the U.S. If these are only 

      trial balloons, they must be pierced now before they take flight, and the 

      Utah congressional delegation has a moral responsibility to wield the pins.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the last 

      week of June, the Bush team ordered nuclear weapons scientists to study 

      a range of options to &quot;reduce lead times&quot; to resume nuclear bomb 

      explosions at the Nevada Test Site. The weapons laboratories argue that 

      testing is needed to assure that the stockpile is reliable, and some fear 

      that the long lead times to prepare tests give political opponents opportunities 

      to prevent renewed testing. A February 1 report commissioned by Congress 

      bemoaned the deteriorating state of nuclear weapons testing and production 

      facilities, leading the Administration to consider a six-year, $2 billion 

      initiative to up-grade the weapons programs.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Frank Gaffney, 

      a former defense official and prominent conservative analyst and advisor, 

      stated in May that &quot;we're going to have to resume on a limited basis 

      underground testing of our nuclear arms&quot;. In a March 12 letter to Secretary 

      of State Colin Powell, Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Jesse 

      Helms called on the Administration to repudiate the signed but unratified 

      Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. The New York Times reported May 9th that 

      Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld seems more inclined to deploy missile 

      defenses and develop nuclear forces than negotiating with Russia or China. 

      &quot;Before taking office Mr. Rumsfeld argued that the U.S. should not 

      ratify the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty because it might need to develop 

      new nuclear weapons,&quot; the Times reported. So far, President Bush has 

      refused to place the treaty before the Senate. &quot;'This is a paradigm 

      shift,' said a senior Pentagon official. 'We are probably not going to be 

      hampered by arms control agreements.'&quot; (NYT 5/9/01)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In April and 

      May, the U.S. accused the Chinese of preparing for a nuclear weapons test 

      (Washington Times 4/9/01, 5/11/01), and similar accusations have been leveled 

      at the Russians (NYT 3/4/01). In the meantime, the Bush Administration is 

      putting on the diplomatic pressure to dismantle the ABM Treaty to pave the 

      way for ballistic missile defense. Secretary Rumsfeld has stated that there 

      may be a dozen different components to BMD, including the stationing of 

      weapons in space. Not only would this constitute a unilateral abbrogation 

      of the Outer Space Treaty, it would likely involve a resumption of nuclear 

      testing to complete development of Nuclear Directed Energy Weapons (NDEW) 

      projects the national weapons labs have experimented with for two decades. 

      Other darlings of the weapons labs, new &quot;low yield&quot; warheads and 

      the earth penetrating &quot;bunker busting&quot; nuclear warhead, are in 

      favor with the hawks in ascendance within this Administration. These too 

      will require nuclear tests to perfect.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Taken together, 

      these developments lead to an inescapable suspicion - that the U.S. is preparing 

      to unilaterally jettison a less than perfect arms control regime fostered 

      by every President since Eisenhower that has kept Armaggedon at bay. These 

      policy maneuverings threaten a costly and dangerous new arms race and are 

      alarming to our allies as well as our adversaries. Most alarming to the 

      constituents of Utah's congressional delegation is the prospect of more 

      nuclear tests upwind, especially those who have suffered painful losses 

      and grievous wrongs from being unwitting &quot;active participants in the 

      nation's nuclear weapons program&quot;.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Despite the 

      commendable efforts of Utah's congressmen to achieve a greater measure of 

      justice for the downwinders, uranium miners, atomic veterans, and defense 

      workers exposed to radiation in the name of national security, allowing 

      testing to begin again promises new generations of victims even as the those 

      sick and dying from the last round hold their government- issued IOU's. 

      We know now that 58% of the more than 900 underground nuclear tests conducted 

      over 33 years leaked radiation, many of those exposing citizens far from 

      the Nevada Test Site borders to harmful doses. Resuming the bomb blasts 

      after a nine year hiatus further increases the risk of Baneberry-like catastrophic 

      leaks, as it will take the bomb testers time to re-learn the techniques 

      for containing the blasts underground. More nuclear tests means more leaks, 

      more victims, and less security.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

The people 

      will not tolerate being bombed again! No political spin, no tortured logic, 

      no fear mongering that the Russians or the Chinese or the North Koreans 

      will be here in the morning, no assurance that &quot;THERE IS NO DANGER&quot; 

      will suffice this time. The assurances we need are that our elected representatives 

      will do everything in their power to prevent a resumption of nuclear testing. 

      Utahns must demand this now!
