A great, sleeping toddler has been awakened in the United States.

And, like all sleeping toddlers, when irritable it's capable of

producing an astonishing amount of noise for such a small body. But

if the United State's until-recently somnambulant peace movement is

going to stop the looming war the United States is both hurtling

towards and largely yearning for, it's going have to grow up. Fast.

<p>

That's not as ridiculous a prospect as it might seem for people who

remember that only two years ago, when the faithful were called to

rally against the decimation of Yugoslavia, virtually nobody came.

But only a few days after the most devastating direct attack on the

United States in its history, there were thousands gathering for a

peace vigil in New York. Sunday, some 4,000 rallied in San

Francisco; another 2,000 in Portland. The day after tomorrow, a

huge crowd is expected in New York for a peace procession from

Union Square to the Army recruiting station in Times Square. 

<p>In communities across the

country, large groups of people who didn't know each other a week

ago -- folks who'd been working on missile defense or gun control

or feeding the hungry or immigration or global justice or any of 50

other issues, and people who hadn't been active on any political

issues at all -- have been meeting and finding their common ground.

They've been reassuring each other that they're not insane, and

that they're not alone in wanting the United States to not respond

to a horrific crime by flattening some country, any country.

<p>

And they're right; they're not alone. While the dominant sense --

the only sense, to hear our networks -- has been to go kick some A-

rab ass, there's a significant, and broad, counter-current. At

first glance, it seems astonishing; only a week ago, thousands died

and virtually everyone in the country began worrying about their

own physical safety and that of their loved ones. Of course

something needs to be done.

<p>

But what? Is war, especially the prolonged one George Bush is now

warning of, the answer? Well, that depends on a few niggling

details. Like: Is it a war? Who's the enemy? How can we fight them?

And, perhaps most critically, what constitutes victory, and how

will we know when we've won?

<p>

The lack of answers should give everyone pause. They're certainly

giving the Bush Administration pause. To its credit (so far), while

the rhetoric has been understandably bellicose and the White House

has been busy lining up foreign support and military options, it

hasn't blindly lashed out yet in retribution. That's the most

immediate concern of the incipient peace movement: that the

perpetrators be accurately identified. The second concern is that

innocent civilians not be targeted; it would be an enormous

mistake, morally and politically, for the United States to make

somebody else's ordinary people pay for the deaths of our ordinary

people.

<p>



(Well, some of them were ours. An inconvenient little fact, omitted

from our myth-making, is that the World Trade Center was, well, a

Trade Center for the World. As of Monday, reported losses of

foreign nationals in the attack include at least 2,500 dead and

missing from 43 countries -- maybe half of the total casualties.)

<p>

At the moment, the United States, as the aggrieved party, has the

world's sympathy, cooperation, and moral respect. As soon as it

incinerates a city full of people who had nothing to do with our

grievances, the War Against Terrorism instantly becomes just

another Yankee invasion. And, as I mentioned yesterday, that's just

the scenario Bin Laden dreams of and any rational person should

dread.

<p>

For that reason, a lot of people feel like they're out of step with

what political leaders are calling for and media pundits are

cheerleading for. Those people want terrorism stopped, but not at

the expense of innocent lives, not at the expense of the Bill of

Rights, and certainly not at the cost of World War III. (None of

which are likely to fully stop terrorism, anyway.) 

<p>

The infant peace movement's challenge is to call for the U.S. to

pursue a more reasoned, effective strategy while still recognizing

people's justified anger and not sounding like apologists for

terrorism. That will require tact, clarity, and understanding. Just

as the Bush Administration has not yet actually made a case that

Osama bin Laden (let alone the Taliban, let alone the poor,

beleaguered people of Afghanistan, let alone the rest of the Islamic

world) were responsible for the attacks, activists don't know for

a fact that the attacks were motivated by past U.S. atrocities. And

that's not what the public wants to hear, anyway.

<p>

One bad sign in that department is that the September 29 anti-World

Bank/IMF demonstrations in Washington D.C., which have been called

off by their major organizers, are being replaced by a proposed

anti-war event being peddled by the International Action Center --

a noisy, parasitic front group for the Stalinist Workers World

Party that stuck its face in front of the cameras and de-legitimized

thousands of Middle American demonstrators at Bush's inaugural last

January with its irrelevant pet issues (e.g., Mumia) and over-the-

top hostile rhetoric. 

<p>

During the Gulf War, the IAC distinguished itself by defending the

conduct of Saddam Hussein. The worst-case scenario is the IAC, in

front of the White House, pulling a similar stunt next week, with

national media being given a snapshot of the "peace movement" as

smaller and, for most people, far more repugnant than it actually

is -- a movement that draws cheers when police move in. Much of the

more mainstream peace movement won't go near the IAC, but happily,

it doesn't need to. The young activists of our new century have a

tremendous advantage, not even available during the Gulf War: the

Internet. In many ways, it renders the need for massive centralized

rallies obsolete, allowing concerned citizens in communities across

the country to organize locally and still be heard globally.

<p>

There's nothing like the imminent, realistic specter of World War

III to terrify, and motivate, a lot of people. But folks wanting to

stop war don't have much time; the movement has to grow up, fast,

pull together a wide variety of ideologies and perspectives, and

figure out how it can have an impact in policy-making -- all before

the U.S. commits itself to a tremendous, irreversible mistake. The

race is on.
