WHEN A right-wing pundit says something particularly asinine, we liberals are not surprised.<p>

 But when she's a woman, we have to behave ourselves and not suggest she's just another hysterical female. Still, Ann Coulter established solid hysterical credentials when she said in the National Review that in responding to terrorists "we should invade their countries, kill their leaders and convert them to Christianity." <p>

 It was an outburst that would have been fatuous had it not been so stupid. But that's not the end of it. Coulter seems intent on making herself so radioactive no one will touch her. The self-destruction of a woman as sure of herself as Coulter is not a pretty sight.<p>

 Normally I'd say decency requires we not watch it. But she seems determined that we watch, and at the rate she's going, even the Fox channel won't have her. Now even the National Review can't stand her. <p>

 It fired her as a contributing editor after refusing to run a subsequent column in which she rants against "swarthy males." Unrepentant, she declared "If the National Review has no spine, they are not my allies." Coulter was a star at the National Review, whose online editor, Jonah Goldberg, is the son of Lucianne Goldberg, the famously malicious inciter of Linda Tripp's schemes to trap Monica Lewinsky. <p>

 Now Coulter describes National Review editor Rich Lowry and his staff as "just girly-boys." This shows, I suppose, that if you put enough right-wing crocodiles in a sandbox, their smiles will soon reveal the teeth they'll use to sink into each others' thighs and splinter their bones. <p>

 It's been ages since we had a good all- right-wing dust up of such reptilian savagery. This presents a splendid chance to air the mildewed closets of some of the crazies who've been running around pretending to be journalists who can be taken seriously. Somebody in the Boston Globe described Coulter, who's blonde, slim and favors short skirts, a "right-wing telebimbo." This was a vile comment because the rubbish Ann spews stands on its own without snide sexist asides.<p>

 She's so given to sweeping generalities that in her hands they become rampaging bulldozers, crashing through rain forests and flattening everything, including truth, in their path. <p>

 Since I'm going on at such length about a creature readers may never have heard of, I guess I should introduce her. She was sane enough to appear on numerous cable-TV shows, has undergraduate and law degrees from accredited universities, and was actually once hired as a lawyer by the Justice Department. She thought of running for Congress from Connecticut. She was even counsel to Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham when the Michigan Republican was on the Senate Judiciary Committee.<p>

 Don't ask me what explains her intemperate ravings. Her friends have to do that. But if President George W. Bush has done anything sensible, it was not to hire her and to distance himself from nut jobs who'd engulf the world in a Christians vs. Muslims Armageddon. <p>

 Drooling fanatics like Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson are perfectly capable of stirring that kettle of malign slop. Bush must be relieved that since they have nowhere to go but the Republican Party, it is safe in their hands.
