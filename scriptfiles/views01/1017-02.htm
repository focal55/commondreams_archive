AS LONG AS WE STILL HAVE IT, I'm going to make the most of the First 

Amendment: What we are doing in, above, and to Afghanistan is short-sighted, 

counterproductive and immoral. That I am among a mere 6 or 10 percent of 

Americans (depending on the poll) who feel this way hurts my heart.

<P>The amount of nonthink, or flat-out denial, that is required to support 

Operation Enduring Freedom is painful to contemplate. Sending thousands of 

kids -- "our brave men and women in uniform" -- to risk their lives for it is 

unbearable.

<P>We Americans have never been known for critical thought and analysis. 

Context and historical perspective rank low on our national priorities list, 

somewhere below foreign language skills but above gas conservation. Add to 

that our deliberate myopia and chronic impatience, and you have the U.S. 

military trashing big chunks of Kabul, Kandahar and Mazar-I-Sharif in pursuit 

of a cave-dwelling, mass murderer and his worldwide band of suicidal disciples.

<P>Damn the advice from seasoned experts on terrorism and the Middle East; 

full speed ahead with the cruise missiles.

<P>After all, we had to do something.

<P>That phrase. It has been uttered so many times since Sept. 11, I expect to 

see it printed on our currency any day now. People who call themselves 

pacifists, people who admit that they are uneasy with the destruction we are 

raining down on Afghanistan -- people who can't see how this frenzy of B-1's 

is actually going to get Osama bin Laden -- offer up the phrase as if it were 

a bona fide moral escape clause: We had to do something.

<P>Lord, yes. We'd waited more than three weeks before we started dropping 

bombs. Such restraint. Why don't we at least cut the b.s., and own up to 

exactly what it is we are doing?

<P>First, does the phrase "collateral damage" sound familiar? When Persian 

Gulf War veteran Timothy McVeigh used it to describe the 168 children and 

adults he murdered in the Oklahoma City bombing, we took it as proof of his 

evilness, as the justification that we needed to execute him.

<P>What is it proof of when U.S. generals use it to describe the Afghan 

civilians that our bombs already have killed? How about the untold numbers who 

will die from hunger or disease on their way to refugee camps that can't take 

them?

<P>Likely, because McVeigh shocked us with the term, "collateral damage" seems 

to have given way to a new euphemism. As Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld put 

it last week:

<P>"There is no question but that when one is engaged militarily that there 

are going to be unintended loss of life." Lest anyone think him cold, Rumsfeld 

added, "And there's no question but that I and anyone involved regrets the 

unintended loss of life."

<P>When U.S. civilians are killed, it's a travesty. When the dead are from 

someplace else -- especially a backward, poverty-stricken country such as 

Afghanistan -- it's regrettable.

<P>Second, let's be honest about the blowback, the truly lethal, political 

time bombs that we plant with every payload among millions of mainstream 

Muslims in the Middle East and Asia. George W. Bush can insist that "the 

United States is a friend to Islam." How many regrettable losses of life do 

reasonable Muslims tolerate before they begin to doubt our friendship?

<P>Without a doubt, after Sept. 11, we did have to do something, something 

that takes time, deep and true coalition-building and patient cunning. Instead, we've chosen to play into a mass murderer's hands and prove that our 

reverence for human life starts diminishing at America's borders.
