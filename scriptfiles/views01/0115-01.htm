A good movie can sometimes clarify the spirit of the times like nothing

else and "Traffic," a new film that surveys the varied battlefields of our

nation's drug war, is that kind of movie.

<P>

   Like "Guess Who's Coming To Dinner" helped us absorb the inevitability of

integration in 1967, like 1969's "Easy Rider" ratified the death of the hippie

ethic, "Traffic" lays bare the futility of a destructive war on drugs that has

gridlocked our culture in the logic of law enforcement.

<P>



This is not to say that the film delivers any specific message about U.S.

drug policy. "Traffic" is not a polemic. The film's persuasive powers come

from an accumulation of mundane details rather than from any dramatic

epiphany. The audience is left to contemplate the absurdity of a policy that

worsens problems it's designed to solve.

<P>

   Steven Soderbergh, an arty, independent filmmaker who first found success

with the movie "sex, lies and videotape," directs the film. In "Traffic," he

combines a gritty, documentary-style with conventional Hollywood narrative

(including cliches of "gateway" drugs and race-sex debauchery) and his

distinctive, "indy" touch to craft a movie of exceptional power. Whether it

works as cinematic art, I leave to the critics. But there's no doubt that it

works as propaganda.

<P>

   Soderbergh probably would prefer his film be seen as art rather than

argument. "We're trying to be as dispassionate as we can," he said in the

production notes used to promote the film. But consider this: One of the

movie's lead characters is the newly appointed U.S. drug czar who is taking

over from a czar who was a general. The reference to the real outgoing drug

czar, Gen. Barry McCaffrey, is obvious and belies Soderbergh's stance of

dispassion.

<P>

   And that's not the only touch of verisimilitude the film exploits. Several

real-life politicians, including Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) and Sen. Orrin

Hatch (R-Utah), make cameo appearances. Hatch, a dedicated drug warrior,

participated reportedly because he was told the film had an anti-drug message.

And, in a sense, it does. One of the three major plot lines involves the

addiction and implacable descent of one teenaged child of privilege. "Traffic"

portrays a lurid scenario of drug addiction, but its ultimate message is that

addicts are not our battlefield enemies. They are our families and they are

ill. Treatment, not jail, is the correct prescription for that illness.

<P>

   The film's panoramic scope gives viewers a glimpse into the cycle of

sickness, cynicism and greed that perpetuates the drug war. Although the

anti-drug effort has been a massive failure, it has been a rewarding

enterprise. As one character in the film attests, law enforcement is often an

entrepreneurial activity. We see clearly how creating criminals is good for

police business and how even cops with good intentions are sucked into a

vortex of corruption.

<P>

   Of course, "Traffic" is just a movie. But it is a superbly timed movie.

President-elect George W. Bush has yet to name his choice for director of the

Office of National Drug Control Policy, and a wide-ranging coalition of public

health, religious, police and drug-policy organizations has called on him to

appoint someone with experience in public health. The group urges Bush to name

a drug czar who "understands that most users are not addicts and are otherwise

responsible citizens; and that drug abuse is a health problem that is not

effectively treated by incarceration."

<P>

   This is a reasonable request. Indeed, Republicans are doing most of the

innovative thinking on drug policy these days. New Mexico's Republican

governor, Gary Johnson, for example, is way ahead of the curve on drug-policy

reform. When the New Mexico Legislature convenes Tuesday, he will introduce

extensive reforms to the state's drug policies, including decriminalization of

marijuana possession of less than an ounce, allowing the use of medical

marijuana for terminally ill patients and the elimination of mandatory minimum

sentences.

<P>

   Meanwhile, the Senate this week begins considering the nomination of John

Ashcroft as U.S. attorney general. Ashcroft, a drug-war devotee from the GOP's

old school, has said, "a government which takes the resources that we would

devote toward the interdiction of drugs and converts them to treatment

resources ... is a government that accommodates us at our lowest and least."

<P>

   "Traffic" is a cinematic refutation of that argument. The film should be

mandatory viewing for Congress and the incoming Bush administration.
