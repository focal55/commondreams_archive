Anti-U.S. sentiment, protests and anger are spreading across Pakistan

even among anti-Taliban moderates and pro-western, English-speaking

liberals.  They wonder why the U.S. continues to bomb a poor country like

their next-door-neighbor-to-the-west, Afghanistan.  Today, as U.S. Secretary

of State Colin Powell arrived to calm their fears, their

long-time-enemy-to-the-east and fellow nuclear power, India began to attack

at least 11 Pakistani border posts.  President Bush bristled  that India and

Pakistan should "stand down during our activities in Afghanistan."  The

United States' biggest oil supplier, Saudi Arabia, spoke out through their

Interior Minister, who said the kingdom was "not at all happy" that the U.S.

"is killing innocent people."  10 of the 19 hijackers who carried out the

September 11 attacks were Saudi nationals and their government has refused

to freeze Osama bin Laden's assets.  Heavily armed with sophisticated U.S.

weaponry, many Saudis admire bin Laden and view the high-tech attacks on one

of the poorest countries in the world as arrogant and insensitive.  As the

peril spirals in the  "War Against Terrorism", intriguing symbols emerge as

"targets"and an ulterior motive for U. S. policy against Afghanistan is

reported.



<p>The "terrorized" American public is distraught and dazzled from

attacks on a series of symbolic targets in the United States that began with

airliners crashing into buildings embodying the essence of U.S. economic and

military power. It has continued with anthrax attacks on jingoistic U.S.

media outlets that the "terrorists" would perceive to be the purveyors of

western decadence and distortion.  Newly published  reports from India and

the U.S. indicate we might have been distracted from considering an even

more sinister scenario of U.S. intentions to "build-a-nation" from the ruins

of Afghanistan as a conduit for Caspian Basin oil and nearby natural gas.



<p>NBC Evening News anchor wanna-be Brian Williams was in obvious denial

on NBC News Saturday night as he characterized the targeted attack of

anthrax on NBC employees as, "It couldn't be more random."  NBC News is a

cheerleader for the "War Against Terrorism"and  is owned by General Electric

Corporation, a major U.S. weapons vendor for decades whose GE Theater on

television was hosted by Ronald Reagan.  General Electric launched the

political career of Reagan by sending him on a speaking tour across the

country, laying the ground-work for his presidency whose hallmark was a

giant U.S. military build-up benefiting his sponsoring corporation.  The

only other successful and documented anthrax attack was diabolically

directed against American Media, Inc., our nation's leading supplier of

supermarket sleaze, whose tabloids appearing now at the checkout counters

contain headlines and captions like: "Faces of Evil, Take a  good look at

the fiendish faces of terrorist mastermind Osama Bin Laden and stare into

the eyes of pure evil" in the National Enquirer; "Bin Laden's Evil Scheme to

Hook America On 'Superdrug'," Terror lord planned to flood America with

killer heroin" in Globe; and "Bin Laden's son, the 10 year old Heir Apparent

of Hatred," in Star.   But bio-terror is not as big a story as

terror-for-oil.



<p>On October 13, in a story titled "America, Oil and Afghanistan"in the

online edition of India's National Newspaper, The Hindu, Sitaram Yechury

reported a quote from U. S. News and World Report of Vice-President Cheney,

in 1998 when he was CEO of Halliburton, a major player in the global energy

industry.  Cheney told energy industry executives, "I cannot think of a time

when we have had a region emerge as suddenly to become as strategically

significant as the Caspian."  Yechury says that the Caspian region oil

reserves may be large enough to offset Persian gulf oil "within the next 15

to 20 years," and that Turkmenistan on Afghanistan's northern border has the

world's third largest natural gas reserves.  Yechury reports that Jon

Flanders in an article, "The Afghanistan Pipeline Connection" quotes Michael

Klare, author of "Resource Wars" as saying that "We (the U.S.)  view oil as

a security consideration and we have to protect it by any means necessary,

regardless of other considerations, other values."  Yechury reported that

the U.S. Government Energy Information fact sheet on Afghanistan dated

December 2000 says, "Afghanistan's significance from an energy standpoint

stems from its geographic position as potential transit route for oil and

gas exports from Central Asia to the Arabian Sea.  This potential includes

proposed multi-billion dollar oil and gas export lines through Afghanistan."



<p>Setting up this shocking scenario of the implicit U.S. attempt to control

the government of Afghanistan to insure oil and natural gas pipelines

through that country from the oil and gas rich Caspian Basin was a story in

Sunday's N. Y. Times by Joseph Kahn.  Kahn reported that "President Bush,

whose foreign policy views during the campaign could be summed up as 'no

more nation building,' declared last week that the United States would form

a new government in Afghanistan and feed its 'poor souls.'"
