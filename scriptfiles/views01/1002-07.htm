<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->We have known it was coming, and now it is here. We are at war. The 

tentative title is "Operation Infinite Justice", though it is very unlikely 

that that is what history books will call it. Democrats and Republicans in 

Congress have united to support the President in this war, and now we are 

all asked to do the same. No matter what.



<p>I cannot agree to that. In a time like this we owe as much support as we can 

give to our families, our friends, our neighbors, our soldiers, to anyone 

hurt by that horror last Tuesday. That support should be unconditional, or 

as unconditional as we can make it. The support we owe to our government is 

different. Not only can it be conditional; it must be.



<p>In college, one of my political science professors told us that democracies 

often take on the characteristics of dictatorships in wartime. We jail 

people for political protests or their skin color; we kill thousands of 

civilians; we make alliances with evil people. Sometimes these things are 

necessary and sometimes they are not. The real difference between a free 

society and a totalitarian one, my teacher said, is in what we do when the 

war is over.



<p>The trouble with this war is that there may be no end. We cannot just defeat 

our enemy and go home. We do not know who he is, or where he is. We will 

never succeed in killing every terrorist in the world, and even if we could 

there would be never be a guarantee that new ones wouldn't be recruited.



<p>What is worse is that we could so easily make the situation worse. A limited 

strike has virtually no chance of success. A larger one would still be 

incomplete, and would almost certainly kill innocent civilians. This is not 

merely a moral consideration. If we kill too many innocents we will create 

new terrorists, and we will also lose allies whom we desperately need. 

Threats will only hold a coalition together for so long. Middle Eastern 

leaders know we cannot fight every country at once, and we need to buy our 

oil from somewhere. Ultimately they need their people's acquiescence more 

than they need us to be their friends.



<p>We have announced that we will destroy governments that harbor terrorists. 

But what happens after? If we destroy the Taliban something will replace it; 

what will it be? Are we going to occupy the country? Are we willing to take 

the risk of destabilizing Pakistan, with its nuclear weapons? All this 

assumes that Afghanistan is the only country in the world that harbors 

terrorists, which we know very well is not true. I understand that we cannot 

do nothing, but doing the wrong thing might be much, much worse.



<p align="center">*******



<p>I have learned many things in the past week. One of them is that I love this 

country far more than I thought I did. As far as I can tell there are four 

reasons for this. The first, and most important, is that it is my home. The 

others are a bit more complicated.



<p>The fact that we are the most powerful country in the world does not make 

the list. I do not believe we are the most virtuous; several countries in 

Western Europe have had cleaner hands than ours for the past fifty years. 

But in a world where power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely, 

our near-absolute power has not corrupted us anywhere near absolutely. I am 

not certain of this, but I believe that there has never been a moment in our 

history when the world as a whole was worse off for existence.



<p>The third reason is that in our darkest hours there have always been 

citizens willing to step forward and denounce the evils around them. When 

this happens, they are ostracized and harrassed and not re-elected, but they 

are usually not imprisoned and they are not killed.



<p>The fourth reason is that we have made all this from people that other 

countries did not want. We all learned the poem in fourth grade: "your 

tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, the wretched 

refuse of your teeming shores." We do not let everyone in, and we are 

sometimes pretty awful to the newcomers, and occaisonally we have closed our 

borders entirely. But we have been more open for a longer time than anyone 

else.



<p>A war, especially this kind of war, threatens all these things. Some of us 

know this only from our history classes and some of us know this from 

personal experience.



<p>I know very well that it is a threat that sometimes needs to be faced. It 

may need to be faced now; I am honestly not certain. But I am not willing to 

face it for revenge; or in a vain attempt to recapture a feeling of security 

that we already know is gone. I am not willing to face it because we know we 

must do something and we do not know what else to do. In the end, the only 

good reason for taking life is saving other lives, not only in theory but in 

fact.
