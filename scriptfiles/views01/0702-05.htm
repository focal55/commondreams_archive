The past two weeks have not been good ones for George W. Bush.

<P> Even before the news emerged that the indispensable Dick Cheney needed more work done on his heart, a series of public opinion polls was giving the president agita.</P>

<P> An article about the latest New York Times/CBS News Poll was headlined, "Bush Loses Favor Despite Tax Cut and Overseas Trip."</P>

<P> Last Thursday The Wall Street Journal was reporting, "Bush's Approval Rating Slips to 50%, a 5-Year Presidential Low."</P>

<P> The Times said its poll showed that "despite his first overseas trip as president and the passage of his sweeping measure to cut taxes, President Bush's standing as a leader on both domestic and foreign fronts has diminished considerably."</P>

<P> The Journal said, "Five months into his presidency, George W. Bush faces sagging approval ratings and an array of issues tilted toward his Democratic opposition." The Journal added that "paradoxically" the unfriendly poll results could give Mr. Bush an opportunity "to regain the initiative."</P>

<P> They could. I suppose. Anything could happen. But that would require an exhibition of leadership qualities that so far have not been seen in this president. Rather than rallying the country to a new and compelling vision of the future — his vision — Mr. Bush has appeared content to quietly follow the lead of his senior advisers, especially Mr. Cheney.</P>

<P> The president, to put it mildly, does not seem vigorously engaged in the very tough job of being president. And that's hurting him.</P>

<P> "His personality," said Betty Thomas, a 62-year-old Republican who responded to The Times's poll, "doesn't inspire a lot of confidence."</P>

<P> Mr. Bush worked hard and successfully for passage of his tax cuts. But he has shown little leadership and remains out of step with a majority of Americans on many other issues. His ratings in the Times poll on energy, on the environment and on foreign policy were well below 50 percent. And by a wide margin, a majority of respondents said his administration favors the rich over the middle class and the poor.</P>

<P> Mr. Bush has maintained the support of his conservative base. "But," as Robert Teeter, one of the pollsters who conducts the Wall Street Journal/NBC News survey, said, "he doesn't have anywhere near the share of the middle he needs to have a governing coalition."</P>

<P> This is the kind of problem that is much easier for a politician like Bill Clinton to turn around. Whenever Mr. Clinton was in trouble (which, of course, was all the time), he was able to draw on his extraordinary political instincts, his intelligence, his communication skills and his eagerness to work as long and as hard as it took to get the job done.</P>

<P> Those are not Mr. Bush's strong points. Most Americans see Dick Cheney, heart problems and all, as doing most of the administration's heavy lifting. And by not forcefully countering the impression that he is disengaged, Mr. Bush gives free rein to those who would characterize him in the worst possible ways.</P>

<P> It's a wonder his approval ratings aren't lower. There are now book- length editions of his misadventures with the English language ("I know how hard it is to put food on your family"), and he is a figure of constant ridicule on late-night television.</P>

<P> The public is probably predisposed to like Mr. Bush. He has that affable, aw-shucks, all-American personality. But he comes across as so detached, so removed from the major issues of the day, so uninterested in them, that he's in danger of coming to be seen as president in name only.</P>

<P> There's a reason why Dick Cheney's health problems get the kind of coverage ordinarily reserved for the president's health.</P>

<P> A major legislative development last week helped to illustrate how the public's view of President Bush is being shaped, and not for the better.</P>

<P> On Friday the Senate passed a popular patients' rights bill that was vehemently opposed by the health insurance industry. Nine Republican senators voted for the bill, but Mr. Bush has threatened to veto it. And that's a problem.</P>

<P> Fairly or unfairly, the man who campaigned for president as a Republican with a heart, a compassionate conservative, appears to be favoring the cold, heartless insurers over ordinary Americans struggling with illness and their finances.</P>

<P> It's exactly the kind of stance that causes poll numbers to sink. </P>
