<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"John," 

              came the voice on the phone last Thursday, "it&#146;s Sam Day."

</font>

<P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As 

              he had a hundred times before, Madison&#146;s most determined activist 

              was calling to promote another noble cause that, were it not for 

              his rare combination of duty and optimism, might otherwise have 

              gone without note. This time, he was looking for support from The 

              Capital Times editorial pages for anti-nuclear weapons activists 

              who were about to be tried for exercising their First Amendment 

              rights in a military "no-protest zone" in northern Wisconsin.</font></P>

<P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As 

              usual, the answer was, "Of course, Sam." No matter how controversial 

              or obscure the movement embraced, no one with a conscience ever 

              feared going out on a limb to back his activist endeavors. The 74-year-old 

              writer and activist was the Underwriter&#146;s Laboratory of the 

              left &#151; if he passed the petition, joined the picket line or 

              risked the arrest, there was never any question that the cause was 

              just. With Sam, however, there was always some question about whether 

              the cause would prevail.</font></P>

<P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Now 

              that he has passed &#151; the victim of a stroke that felled him 

              Friday &#151; anyone who seeks to turn this world onto a more peaceful 

              and humane course will find their good burden heavier. That&#146;s 

              because Sam carried more than his share of the load.</font></P>

<P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sam&#146;s 

              causes were never hopeless, and he could count more than his share 

              of victories. His 1979 fight as The Progressive&#146;s managing 

              editor to overcome federal government attempts to censor Howard 

              Moreland&#146;s account of how to build an hydrogen bomb &#151; 

              the details of which had been obtained from public records &#151; 

              resulted in a landmark free speech precedent.</font></P>

<P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 

              celebrity he obtained during the H-bomb imbroglio guaranteed Sam 

              steady work as a writer and editor. Instead, like internationally 

              renowned historian E.P. Thompson, Sam put his pen down &#151; for 

              the most part &#151; and in the early years of that dark decade 

              went into the streets as a campaigner for peace and nuclear disarmament.</font></P>

<P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Those 

              Cold War days were heady times for anti-nuke activists, and Sam 

              was in the thick of it &#151; inviting the arrests for nonviolent 

              civil disobedience at military facilities that would ultimately 

              land him in federal prison for six months.</font></P>

<P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">With 

              the arrival of the 1990s, the Cold War ended. Yet Sam recognized 

              that the nuclear peril remained. So he carried on in the lonelier 

              but no less necessary struggle to collect the peace dividend. Others 

              moved on to the easier causes of the moment, but Sam retained an 

              appropriate focus on the nuclear weapons that posed the greatest 

              threat to humanity.</font></P>

<P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 

              an age of forgetting, victories were harder won. But Sam had a way 

              of reminding us all of the lingering danger and of the injustices 

              done in its name. He was a diligent crusader to free Mordechai Vanunu, 

              the Israeli nuclear technician who was jailed for revealing that 

              his country was secretly developing nuclear weaponry.</font></P>

<P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 

              man who had battled to blow the lid off America&#146;s nuclear secrets 

              knew the necessity of defending whistleblowers in other lands. Thompson, 

              the British historian who shared Sam&#146;s view that anti-nuclear 

              activism was a moral imperative, referred before his death to those 

              who battled militarism as the heroes of "a war of faith against 

              a class of destroyers."</font></P>

<P align="left">

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

Another 

              hero has fallen. But the long and often thankless war of faith is 

              not done; not so long as the stations of power remain occupied by 

              destructive practitioners of a nuclear madness.
