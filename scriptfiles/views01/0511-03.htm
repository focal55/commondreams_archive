For half a century, we've been watching rituals of retribution. 

Countless entertainment shows on TV have presented certain vengeance as 

dramatic justice. In time for the last commercial, the designated bad guys 

got what was coming to them.



<p>These days, news coverage -- or what passes for it -- tends to 

edge out fictional concoctions. The surfaces of pathos, anguish and 

suffering are readily available without scripts, actors or set designers. 

Around the country, local news programs air plenty of crime sensations with 

yellow police tape in the background. Cable channels strive to offer the 

latest shootings in progress. And trials can't miss: Inside a courtroom, 

everyone makes a perfect cameo appearance.



<p>A week before the scheduled execution of Timothy McVeigh, the 

major cable networks -- CNN, Fox and MSNBC -- could hardly tear themselves 

away from the spectacle of a 14-year-old boy as he testified about what 

happened when he shot a teacher, taking an adult's life and shattering his 

own. The camera work and sound quality were crystal clear.



<p>McVeigh's crime, we're told, was the deadliest act of terrorism 

ever on U.S. soil. Among the 168 people he killed were 19 young children. 

 From prison, he has insisted on describing the kids he murdered as 

"collateral damage." It's a phrase that disturbed some media consumers a 

decade ago, during the Gulf War, when it was the euphemism of choice for 

top Pentagon officials and many American reporters.



<p>In a recent statement to a Fox News Channel correspondent, McVeigh 

said: "Collateral damage? As an American news junkie, a military man, and a 

Gulf War veteran, where do they think I learned that?"



<p>Unrepentant and preferring to undergo capital punishment now 

rather than later, McVeigh has declined to appeal his death sentence, a 

move that would have delayed his execution for years. He expresses no 

remorse about setting off a bomb at the federal building in Oklahoma City. 

Explaining his motives to the authors of a new biography, McVeigh 

commented: "I did it for the larger good." With more diplomatic language, 

that's the sort of remark that U.S. officials frequently made during the 

Gulf War.



<p>If McVeigh were black or brown instead of white -- and if he had 

grown accustomed to the idea of inflicting lethal violence as a member of a 

gang instead of as a member of the U.S. Army -- it's a safe bet that news 

media would have flooded us with feature reports, analysis and commentaries 

about the inner-city culture of violence and pathology that produced him. 

But in McVeigh's case, we're made to understand that he was a bad apple in 

a wholesome barrel overseen by Uncle Sam. The good apples, the ones we can 

all be proud of, understood that killing is laudable only when authorized.



<p>And now, it has been authorized in Terre Haute. During the days 

before his execution in that Indiana city, T-shirts with his face on them 

have been selling briskly. A simple message is printed on those souvenir 

shirts: "Die, die, die."



<p>Long ago, Bertrand Russell observed: "The reformative effect of 

punishment is a belief that dies hard, chiefly, I think, because it is so 

satisfying to our sadistic impulses."



<p>The slaying of Tim McVeigh promises to be an unprecedented pageant 

of capital punishment. Advance stories predict that 2,000 journalists will 

descend on Terre Haute for the festivities.



<p>In Newsweek's words, the execution "will be shown on 

closed-circuit television to several hundred victims of the Oklahoma City 

bombing and their families -- the biggest crowd to watch an execution since 

the 1930s." In theory, the audience will be limited. But some of the 

viewers will surely be on national TV to describe what they saw. Bootlegged 

videos are likely to find their way to a wider audience.



<p>If "we," ostensibly represented by the state, are going to kill 

with premeditated executions, then we may as well see the grisly results. 

But why stop there?



<p>A lot of babies perish due to social conditions that could be 

prevented by a shift in government priorities. For the first time in a 

quarter-century, the latest annual figures tell us, infant mortality rates 

have not dropped in the United States -- remaining at 7.2 infants per 1,000 

births. Meanwhile, the Children's Defense Fund says, 10.8 million of the 

nation's children are lacking health insurance.



<p>Unfortunately, there's no media frenzy to cover what happens when 

the state, in effect, routinely kills many Americans simply by inaction -- 

not enforcing workplace-safety rules, or not reducing air pollution that 

menaces people chronically short of breath, or not providing health care 

for the uninsured.



<p>With the corporate-dominated state functioning as a serial killer 

every day, news outlets should shine a bright light on its innocent victims.
