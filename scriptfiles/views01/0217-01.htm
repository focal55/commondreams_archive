<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The energy crisis in California 

          demonstrates just how far we&#146;ve let the interests of the rich and 

          powerful subvert the well-being of the people.

</font>

<P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At one time in America, the 

          production and distribution of electric power were closely guarded by 

          government regulatory agencies to make sure that the people got adequate 

          electricity at a fair price.</font></P>

<P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In return, utilities were granted 

          monopolies and while the people were guaranteed economical electric 

          power, the utilities were guaranteed a fair rate of return on their 

          money.</font></P>

<P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">And in many parts of the country 

          -- Wisconsin was a prime example -- local governments decided that rather 

          than granting these monopoly rights to a private company, they would 

          run the power company themselves. There still are more than 70 municipally 

          owned electric power companies in the state, all doing well and all 

          providing relatively low-cost power to their local customers.</font></P>

<P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Stoughton and Sun Prairie are 

          but two examples right here in Dane County. Their municipally owned 

          utilities obtain the power, distribute it, and maintain the system with 

          local employees. The mayor and city council serve as the management. 

          If there is money left over at the end of the year, it goes into the 

          city coffers rather than being shipped away to serve some distant stockholders.</font></P>

<P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It took the government, after 

          all, to get power to most of America. The old U.S. Rural Electrification 

          Agency provided the money and technology to electrify the small towns 

          and farms throughout the states. Private utilities wouldn&#146;t do 

          it because the cost of serving remote and less populated areas might 

          eat into their profits.</font></P>

<P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Until recently, this system 

          of guaranteed monopolies and municipal utilities served the people well. 

          Everyone seemed to have adequate power and at costs that were affordable.</font></P>

<P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But oh, how things have changed.</font></P>

<P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Somehow along the way, our 

          utilities and our governments decided that it was more important to 

          satisfy the perennial appetites of Wall Street than it was to serve 

          the customers.</font></P>

<P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We&#146;d have deregulation, 

          just like the airlines and the phone company. We were told that all 

          the competition would work to our advantage, a pledge that never made 

          any sense to me. How, after all, can you reduce electric rates to customers 

          and earn more money for your stockholders at the same time?</font></P>

<P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Nevertheless, gullible state 

          governments and a shamelessly hands-off federal government began messing 

          with the country&#146;s power system. They willy-nilly gave up government 

          control (campaign contributions from the right people didn&#146;t hurt). 

          No longer could they tell a utility to build a new plant or extend service 

          to a new locale. No longer could they demand that the utility employ 

          sufficient maintenance people, nor could they tell a power company not 

          to build a plant that was deemed unnecessary. Some utilities branched 

          out into new fields, taking their eye off the primary business.</font></P>

<P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In California, the people and 

          the power companies are now at the mercy of an unregulated cabal of 

          power generators. The utilities insist they will go bankrupt unless 

          prices to the people are increased by about three times. Other states 

          aren&#146;t faring as badly, but the jury is still out on how well their 

          new privatized, stock-market driven systems will work in the future. 

          Any bets on how the average consuming family will fare?</font></P>

<P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We allowed a perfectly good 

          and fair system to be kidnapped right from under our noses.</font></P>

<P align="left">

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

The only good news is that 

          there&#146;s still time to save the system in Wisconsin.
