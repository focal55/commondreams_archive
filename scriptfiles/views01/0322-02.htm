An e-mail arrived from a fellow named Richard O&#146;Neill after 

              my column lamenting the fact that all too many Americans consider 

              the likes of Rush Limbaugh and his imitators news programs.

<P>"We listen to Rush because media such as The Capital Times, Dan 

              Rather, Peter Jennings, etc., are so blatantly biased and won&#146;t 

              tell us the truth," he said.</P>

<P>Yes, the big lie, repeated often enough, has indeed become "fact" 

              with people like O&#146;Neill.</P>

<P>The lie is the so-called "liberal" bent of the "mainstream" news 

              media. It&#146;s utter nonsense and anyone who takes the time to 

              take a good look at what is being printed and broadcast in this 

              country is trying to pull a fast one if he claims it is so.</P>

<P>O&#146;Neill, for example, claims that the "mainstream" media never 

              reported that George Bush has a bachelor&#146;s degree from Yale 

              and an advanced degree from Harvard and that all Al Gore has is 

              a bachelor&#146;s degree. Nor, according to O&#146;Neill, did it 

              report that Bush founded an oil and gas exploration company, as 

              well as being one of the managing partners of the Texas Rangers 

              Major League Baseball club, while all Al Gore was was an investigative 

              reporter in Nashville.</P>

<P>It makes me wonder if my e-mail pal can read.</P>

<P>Limbaugh and his right-wing followers always complain they are 

              besieged, that conservative candidates are always demonized by the 

              "establishment press."</P>

<P>Perhaps some of these conservatives ought to ask Al Gore or Bill 

              Clinton about being demonized in the mainstream press. Perhaps they 

              ought to look at who three-fourths of America&#146;s 1,400 newspapers 

              endorsed for president in 2000.</P>

<P>Maybe they ought to count the editorial page columnists and see 

              how many papers carry a Molly Ivins versus a George Will or an Ellen 

              Goodman versus a John Leo.</P>

<P>Have any of these poor besieged conservatives flipped through their 

              cable channels? Are they blind or do they see Bill O&#146;Reilly 

              and a dozen other clones savaging anyone who dare call himself or 

              herself left of center? Have they taken a look at the political 

              leanings of the radio talk show hosts who have virtually taken over 

              the AM dial? Are they deaf, too?</P>

<P>Conservatives currently control both houses of Congress plus the 

              presidency. They have made inroads in state houses across the country. 

              Their corporate sugar daddies virtually call all the shots on important 

              economic legislation. One of their favorite organizations, the NRA, 

              controls politicians everywhere.</P>

<P>Yup, this liberal media really has clout.</P>

<P>The real truth, Richard O&#146;Neill, is that it has none because 

              it doesn&#146;t exist. But your buddy Rush won&#146;t tell you that.
