It was three and half years ago that

Helen Hunt brought cheers from movie

audiences across the country when she spat

out a string of expletives with the acronym

"H.M.O." nestled in the middle of it. She got

the Academy Award for Best Actress ("As

Good As it Gets"), and the industry's image

has continued to slide downhill.



         <p>The system of managed care --

getting our health care through HMO's and

other large insurers -- has failed. For a while

in the 1990s it seemed like these

organizations could solve the one problem

that employers worried about -- containing

costs. But now insurance premiums are

rising at double-digit rates again. In the

mean time the care managers' attempts at

cost-cutting seem to have succeeded only in

angering millions of Americans, while

simultaneously enriching some very highly

paid executives. (William McGuire, CEO of

UnitedHealth Group, led the pack with

$54.1 million in compensation last year,

adding to his $358 million accumulation of

stock options.)



         <p>But the exorbitant rewards at the top

of the managerial pyramid are only a small

fraction of the waste that makes our health

care system the most expensive in the world.

We spend nearly 14 percent of our national

income on health care, while the average for

other high-income countries is about 8

percent. And unlike other rich countries, we

leave one out of six of our citizens -- 43

million people -- without health insurance.



         <p>This result is altogether predictable

from a system that has private insurers

competing to cover the healthiest prospects

and abandon, as much as they can, the sick.

You don't need a degree in actuarial science

to see that this is the most effective way for

an insurer to make money, even it means

devoting enormous resources to these non-

health-care goals.



         <p>The legislation now slogging through

Congress will add another layer or two of

oversight -- including the court system -- on

top of the existing bureaucracy. Despite the

additional costs, this will be an

improvement, since there needs to be some

way under the present system to hold the

managed care industry accountable. If the

bill makes it through the House without too

much amputation, there will be some added

rights for at least some of the insured. These

include the right to external review when

treatment is denied, the right to sue insurers

for denial of covered care, and the right to

visit the nearest emergency room.



         <p>But the Patients' Bill of Rights will

not help the uninsured, or tens of millions

more -- including chronically ill patients

paying exorbitant premiums -- that are

underinsured. To solve these problems, and

to contain costs, we will need a universal

health insurance system, with the

government as the insurer.



         <p>The case for social insurance is a

simple one, based on the human condition

and some fundamental economic logic.

First, we all get old and sick eventually, so

it's best to insure against these hardships

when we are young, healthy, and working.

Second, the most efficient way to do this is

to put everyone into one big "risk pool" -- it

saves enormously on overhead costs. If you

don't believe this, just compare the

administrative costs of Social Security --

which provides social insurance for

retirement, life insurance, and disability -- to

those of the private life insurance industry:

0.8 percent versus 12 percent. And lastly,

health care is not a commodity like a DVD

player, but a basic human need. A decent

society does not let its fellow humans go

without it.



         <p>Medicare was an attempt to extend

the principles of social insurance, which

have been so successful in the realm of

Social Security, to health care for the

elderly. At the time (1965) it was assumed

that this would soon be extended to the rest

of the population.



         <p>The failure to achieve this goal

reflects a failure of our political system, a

somewhat limited form of democracy in

which insurance and pharmaceutical giants

purchase -- with their political contributions

-- the right to a veto over health care policy.

Last year the pharmaceutical companies

spent $30 million for a blitz of very

successful TV ads, in order to block

President Clinton's attempt to create a

prescription drug benefit for Medicare.



         <p>Now the insurance industry is

deploying its army of lobbyists to gut the

Patients' Bill of Rights, as much as it can.

But with the economy slowing and health

care costs rising at unsustainable rates, it is

only a matter of time until real health care

reform -- with universal social insurance --

is back on the political agenda.
