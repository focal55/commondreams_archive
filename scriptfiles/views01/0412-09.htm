The standoff with China has been resolved,

but it has raised some serious and long-overdue

questions about our foreign policy in the post-Cold-

War era.



<p>This first one is: does the United States

really need to police the whole world? Because if

we are going to remain committed to this job, we

can expect more involvement in incidents of this

kind, not to mention wars and other violent

conflicts.



<p>Most Americans do not find this role any

more appealing than the idea of going around to all

the bars in Chicago on a Saturday night and

breaking up fights. "We have enough problems here

at home," is normally the prevailing sentiment

among the citizenry when the question of overseas

intervention is raised.



<p>But our foreign policy establishment -- the

politicians, think tanks, and many intellectuals and

journalists -- remains attached to the idea of

America ruling the world.



<p>"The United States is the only power that

can handle a showdown in the [Persian] Gulf,

mount the kind of force that is needed to protect

Saudi Arabia, and deter a crisis in the Taiwan

Strait," says President Bush's National Security

Adviser Condoleeza Rice.



<p>Do we really want that job?



<p>For half a century Americans were told that

policing the world was a strategic and moral

imperative: we were "saving the world from

communism," and defending our own national

security. On this pretext Washington overthrew

democratically elected governments, installed and

financed some of the most bloodthirsty regimes in

world history, went to war in Vietnam, and even

supported genocide -- from Indonesia to Guatemala

-- when our leaders found it politically convenient

to do so.



<p>Looking at the world in 2001, it's hard to

believe that we were really fighting communism all

those years. Today China is the only remaining

communist country with any power, and it is not

only a major (if lopsided) trading partner but also

the largest recipient of US foreign investment in the

developing world.



<p>Ironically, that may be what saves us from a

new Cold War with China. There are just too many

lucrative business deals that could go sour. China

may not be a rich country, but it has one of the

world's fastest growing economies and a fifth of the

Earth's population.



<p>The Clinton administration worked hard to

get China into the World Trade Organization -- it's

not quite there yet -- so that US

telecommunications, financial services, and other

big corporations could break into these potentially

huge markets. Manufacturers such as Nike and

Timberland are happy with their Chinese production

facilities, where workers put in 70-hour weeks for

wages of 22 cents an hour, and are not likely to

strike or try to form an independent union.



<p>This was the Bush Administration's

dilemma: some of their biggest corporate supporters

would find it difficult to forgive them if they blew

all these prizes over this one incident. On the other

hand, there are still influential people who would

appreciate a new Cold War, for all the purposes that

the old one served.



<p>Besides providing an excuse for the crimes

of empire, the Cold War was also a rationale for our

enormous military expenditures. This was

America's unique form of industrial policy, a way to

subsidize our leading industries such as aircraft and

computers.



<p>A number of political commentators have

suggested that Mr. Bush's recent unfriendly gestures

toward Russia, North Korea, and China (before the

current crisis) might be related to his efforts to fund

his own high-tech subsidy: $60 billion dollars for a

missile defense system.



<p>But right now -- at least as regards China --

the balance is still in favor of more immediate

business interests. Hence the Administration's

delivery of a "non-apology apology" to resolve the

standoff, despite the embarrassment.



<p>The best way to prevent future incidents

would be to stop looking for trouble all over the

world. We would never allow a foreign plane with

sophisticated surveillance equipment to fly 70 miles

from coast of Florida, gathering intelligence on our

military. Yet Washington insists that it has the right

to make 200 of these kinds of flights each year to

spy on China.



<p>You can't have it both ways -- unless you

want to claim the status of Emperor, and pay the

price to enforce it. We are already paying more than

$1000 each year -- for every man, woman, child,

and infant -- to the Pentagon, while we forgo urgent

needs such as prescription drug coverage for our

senior citizens.



<p>While the American people bear the costs

and risks of maintaining an empire, the benefits do

not trickle down. It's time we began to downsize the

grand ambitions of our leaders.
