The few Americans who visit Afghanistan discover, as I have, that fear rules the lives of ordinary Afghans. Fear of the Taleban regime and the police state that they have imposed. Fear of Osama bin Laden, his fighters and other &quot;international guests&quot; who have joined the Taleban in ruthless attacks on Afghan civilians. And fear that more American cruise missiles will hit the country, as they did in 1998 after the bombing attacks on U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania that were blamed by U.S. officials on Mr. bin Laden and his supporters.

<div style="visibility:hidden">.</div>

As the United States plans its response to the atrocities of last week, two questions should override all others: How can those responsible be punished without inflicting more terror on people in Afghanistan who have themselves been the victims of these same criminals? And who will be left to govern Afghanistan when it is all over?

<div style="visibility:hidden">.</div>

Lawmakers in Washington who ought to know better have been urging the United States to hit back hard and damn the consequences, dismissing concerns about collateral damage, as if the Afghan people were responsible for Mr. bin Laden's rise to power.

<div style="visibility:hidden">.</div>

In the past few days Afghans have watched virtually all United Nations aid workers and other international staff leave their ruined and starving country, knowing full well what that portends for them. They have good reason to fear, and not just from the possibility of an errant missile. Until now, the UN World Food Program had been feeding 3 million Afghans in rural areas of the country; it is unlikely that even a fraction of that program can continue.

<div style="visibility:hidden">.</div>

The anticipated collateral damage is almost incalculable: The Afghans now pouring out of the cities in fear of a U.S. air strike will be joined by thousands of others roaming the drought-stricken country in search of food or trying to crowd once again into Pakistan or Iran, neither of which will welcome them since they are already hosting 3.5 million Afghan refugees between them.

<div style="visibility:hidden">.</div>

There will be other collateral damage. The Bush administration has vowed to end state support for terrorism. In Afghanistan, that could only mean removing the Taleban itself. But even if the United States and its allies succeed in crushing Mr. bin Laden's organization - and that's a big if - and crippling the Taleban, what kind of government will follow?

<div style="visibility:hidden">.</div>

Three days before the U.S. attacks, Mr. bin Laden apparently organized the assassination of the Taleban's most able Afghan opponent, the guerrilla commander Ahmed Shah Massoud. The groups fighting the Taleban may still get increased support, if not from the United States directly, then from Iran, Russia and India. But none of the Afghan factions has the capacity to create a government.

<div style="visibility:hidden">.</div>

In the years that followed the withdrawal of Soviet forces in 1989 and the subsequent collapse of the Communist government of Afghanistan, anarchy reigned. Warlords divided the country, and destroyed a third of Kabul in their fight to control it. It was against this background that the Taleban emerged, with Pakistan's support, to impose their own interpretation of Islamic law, enforced at gunpoint.

<div style="visibility:hidden">.</div>

If the Taleban leadership is killed, what will become of the thousands of fighters there and in Pakistan committed to their cause? How will they react towards Pakistan. What new force will emerge in Afghanistan itself, as commanders and their patrons again carve up the country?

<div style="visibility:hidden">.</div>

What has been missing in the increasingly jingoistic atmosphere in the United States is any reference to Afghanistan's long-standing crisis of impunity. The Taleban and some of Mr. bin Laden's forces are guilty of war crimes and crimes against humanity in Afghanistan. These include the massacres of thousands of civilians and the burning down of entire towns; though these have been documented, not one member of the Taleban has ever been indicted for such crimes.

<div style="visibility:hidden">.</div>

If the military response to the attacks on U.S. civilians leads to the capture of Taleban leaders, then they should be tried for all of these crimes not in U.S. military tribunals but in an international war crimes tribunal such as has been established for Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia. Exposure of these crimes might also help dissuade their supporters from taking up the cause anew.

<div style="visibility:hidden">.</div>

It will take more than that, of course, to undo the networks of violence that have eroded civil society and provided the pretext for state repression from the Gulf states to Central and South Asia. But without real justice, and not just revenge, the terror will not end for Afghanistan, or for the rest of the world.
