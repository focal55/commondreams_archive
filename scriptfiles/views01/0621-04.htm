In Washington, a "gaffe" occurs when a high-level official

accidentally says what he means. The Bush administration has been

remarkably gaffe-free so far, with almost everyone sticking to the same

bland script. All except Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill, that is, whose

gaffes offer a glimpse into the real philosophy of the Bush corporation

that now runs the United States.

<p>  O'Neill's latest occurred in a recent interview with the Financial

Times in which he questioned why the government should provide Social

Security, Medicare or any other social insurance.

<p>"Able-bodied adults should save enough on a regular basis so that they

can provide for their own retirement and, for that matter, health and

medical needs," he said.

<p>  The Treasury secretary's candor goes a long way toward explaining why

Bush's giant $1.3-trillion tax cut--most of whose benefits will go to

multimillionaires like O'Neill--hasn't caused more worry in the White

House about what will happen to Social Security and Medicare when the

baby boomers retire and there's no money left to pay the bill.

<p>Bush Inc. assumes that boomers will just take care of themselves.

<p>  Seen in this light, the commission recently launched by George W. Bush

to recommend ways to save Social Security (packed with people already

committed to "privatizing" it) and the new White House move to overhaul

Medicare with "market-based changes" are fig leafs for a long-term

strategy to get rid of these social insurance schemes altogether.

<p>  O'Neill's candor is refreshing. It deserves more than a "gotcha" from

Democrats looking for ways to scare elderly voters in the 2002 mid-term

elections and the 2004 presidential contest.

<p>The Treasury secretary raises one of the most fundamental questions

society faces: Why should there be any social insurance at all?

<p>  The idea for Social Security was dreamed up by Labor Secretary Frances

Perkins and signed into law by Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1935.

Unemployment insurance and welfare were parts of the original scheme.

<p>Medicare was President Johnson's doing, 30 years later.

<p>  The broad idea was easily understood by the generations that

experienced the Depression, World War II, the Cold War and some deep

recessions. Any family could find itself down on its luck through no

fault of its own. Family savings could go down the drain if the economy

turned really sour.

<p>Its breadwinner might lose his (almost always "his") job and have a

hard time finding another. Or he might become disabled or die, leaving

his wife and children destitute. An elderly person or couple might lose

everything in an economic down draft and face their twilight years in

grinding poverty.

<p>  A humane society, it was assumed, would pool some of its resources to

guard against these personal misfortunes.

<p>Like any insurance system, citizens would be expected to pay small

premiums. But unlike private insurance, everyone would be included

regardless of the likelihood that they'd need to draw on the insurance

pool.

<p>Rich and poor, healthy and sick, young workers and older workers--all

would pitch in.

<p>  Treasury Secretary O'Neill would prefer going back to the days before

social insurance, when individuals either had to save their own earnings

against the possibility they'd need help down the line or buy their own

private insurance. Presumably, if the responsibility rested entirely on

their shoulders, they'd save more and take better precaution to avoid

harm's way.

<p>  Some families, however, don't earn enough to allow them to save much of

anything. And some harms--a catastrophic illness, a disabling accident, a

factory closing, a stock-market plunge--can't be avoided.

<p>  Meanwhile, private insurers naturally will do everything they can to

sign up clients at the lowest risk of needing them, while eschewing the

high risks. After all, insurance companies and HMOs aren't charitable

institutions--they need to show profits. And all are becoming more

efficient at discriminating among potential consumers, weeding out the

high risks and marketing to the low.

<p>  So without social insurance, people who are poorer or who face higher

risk of having bad things happen to them won't be covered.

<p>People at the other end--richer and at lower risk--will efficiently

pool their resources and get insurance at a much lower rate than if they

had to bear the extra cost of insuring the poorer and the riskier.

<p>  It's coming to be like that all over the land. The richer, healthier,

younger, well-educated and well-connected and their children are doing

better and better. (They even got a big tax windfall just now.) And the

gap between them and the bottom half of the nation widens.

<p>  It's not just an income and wealth gap. It's also a geographical

gap--they live farther and farther apart. And a psychological gap--the

better off don't even encounter the other half or understand them or

empathize with the daily burdens and challenges they face.

<p>  The welfare "safety net" that was included in the Social Security Act

of 1935 already is in shreds. Unemployment insurance reaches a far

smaller percentage of people who lose their jobs than it did two decades

ago.

<p>And now Social Security and Medicare are on the dock.

<p>  When Americans faced a common problem--the Depression, a hot war, a

cold war--we understood intuitively that we were all in it together.

Someone's misfortune could be anyone's: "There but for the grace of God

go I." Social insurance was a natural impulse, a first cousin to

patriotism.

<p>But that sense of commonality is waning as we drift into separate

worlds of privilege and resignation.

<p>  Treasury Secretary O'Neill and the administration of which he is a part

may see the future of American society better than we would like to admit

to ourselves. But if that's the future, it won't be much of a society.
