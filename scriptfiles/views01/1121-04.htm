Well, now that the sympathetic rock benefits have ended, Bush and the GOP

Congress have begun nickel-and-diming New York on paying for rebuilding in

the wake of September 11.



<p>Despite estimates of costs as high as $100 billion in direct and indirect

costs from the disaster, Bush has declared that no new Federal help beyond

the initial $20 billion is needed - even as the GOP has approved over $100

billion in tax breaks for big business and the wealthy.



<p>Well, forget arguments about compassion or charity for the victims of

September 11.  New York should demand the rebuilding aid as a debt due by

the nation, after decades of New York subsidizing the rest of the country.



<p>Every year, New York state's citizens have paid billions more in federal

taxes than they received in federal spending.    In 1999, New Yorkers paid

an average of $5,834 in federal taxes each, yet received back only $4944 in

spending. In the last decade, the state de facto transferred over $160

billion to the citizens of other states.



<p>Now, it's time for payback.



<p>When New York was riding high in the 1990s, it was appropriate for its

citizens to help out poorer states and pay for rebuilding after their floods

and hurricanes.



<p>But with physical devastation and over 285,000 new workers displaced and

unemployed in the state after September 11, it is rank ungratefulness for

the Congressmembers from other states to begrudge a dime to New York now.



<p>Since New York citizens regularly transfer $16-20 billion per year to other

states, the $20 billion initially allocated so far for New York rebuilding

barely evens the debt owed for this year alone.   So this doesn't even count

as "help"-- it's just avoids the Feds further draining the blood of a

corpse.  It literally does not even start to repay the hundreds of billions

of dollars the state's citizens have transferred to the rest of the nation

when they needed the help.



<p>And it's not even clear that Bush and the GOP will actually pay out those

initial funds.  In the first weeks of November, on largely party-line votes,

the GOP refused to force the full allocation of the initial funds promised

to the state.



<p>On the other hand, it's hardly surprising that Bush and Senate Minority

leader Trent Lott fight to open the budget floodgates for corporate tax

breaks and new defense spending, even while they leave New York's unemployed

out in the cold.  Defense spending goes overwhelmingly to states like Texas

and Mississippi, the home state of Lott.  Mississippi receives $1695 in

defense spending for each of its citizens each year, while New York's

citizens receive only $345 each on average in defense spending for jobs in

their state. Overall in the last decade, Mississippi received $70 billion

more in federal spending than its citizens paid in taxes.  It's amazing that

a representative of Mississippi, which has been a prime beneficiary of New

York's net transfers in that same period, would begrudge New York a dime in

the wake of the September 11 tragedy.



<p>But we've been here before. When New York City ran into economic problems in

the 1970s, the then-Ford White House famously told the city to "drop dead"--

they were on their own.  At the time, the new Senator from New York, Daniel

Patrick Moynihan, began highlighting the fact that forced cutbacks in social

services and mass transit in the state and city were happening even as the

federal government was taking far more in taxes than it provided in spending

for the citizens of New York.



<p>Moynihan launched a yearly survey of which states were getting more in

federal spending than they paid in taxes and which states, like New York,

were subsidizing the rest.  Eventually co-sponsored with the Taubman Center

at the Kennedy School, these studies highlighted the fact that high-poverty

states like California and New York were not draining the national treasury.

In fact, they were subsidizing the so-called individualistic heartland.



<p>If you look over the more recent studies

(<a href="http://www.ksg.harvard.edu/fisc99/" target="_new">http://www.ksg.harvard.edu/fisc99/</a>), the remarkable fact is that the states

that supported George W. Bush for President are overwhelmingly the "welfare

states", receiving far more in federal spending than they pay in taxes.



<p>States who voted against Bush's "compassionate conservatism" are

overwhelmingly net donors of funds to the Bush states.  New York and New

Jersey, who together share the direct costs of the World Trade Center attack

through their co-governance of the Port Authority, have transferred a net

$500 billion to other states in the last twenty years.



<p>And it is clear that Bush and the GOP want to keep it that way.

Unemployment insurance to help New York's unemployed is not on the table,

but subsidies for the oil industry, new defense spending, and other benefits

for the heartland welfare states are being handed out with abandon.  Given

that states like New York will eventually end up paying the tab for this new

deficit spending, by the time Bush is done with the budget, New York is not

being helped at all.



<p>Those left without jobs and health care in the wake of the World Trade

Center attack better get ready to pay off these deficits in the future to

pay for Bush's giveaways to the corporations.



<p>For all the fake compassion and breast-beating, Bush and company have just

temporarily pulled back the fangs in anticipation of continuing to suck the

state dry in the future.



<p>But enough is enough.  If the Bushies are dead to compassion, then New

Yorkers and all workers should demand economic relief for the unemployed as

a debt owed for decades.



<p>America, you own New York!
