<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->In 1997, I was the only woman and the only tourist on a bus of laborers traveling from Damascus to the Euphrates. The bus was dilapidated but one thing worked perfectly: the television. Throughout the journey, we watched random scenes of violence from Hollywood action movies, spliced together with Arabic subtitles. As the men watched rapt, the video showed a woman in a tiny stars-and-stripes bikini repeatedly firing a machine gun, the barrel banging against her naked flesh. At that point, every face on the bus looked at me, fascinated, incredulous - as if to say, is that really how you live, what you do? 

<P>This week, meanwhile, video rental shops throughout America have reported a surge in the popularity of action movies in the wake of the horrifying hijack attacks on New York: film after film featuring Arab terrorist spectaculars. But while the west and the east watch similar fantasy movies about each other and aspire to own the same consumer goods, there is a profound mutual incomprehension - made clearer than ever by the events of the last two weeks. The paradox of globalization is that while it has given the appearance of a closer world, it has, if anything deepened the alienation between the Muslim world and the west - with consequences not only for the safety of the global community, but also resonances for our own sense of community in the west.  

<P>The scale of what happened in New York has,unsurprisingly, overwhelmed America's capacity to begin to understand how the western world is seen from outside - and to learn about what is being done in its name around the globe. It comes as a surprise to many Britons and Americans, for example, that their countries have continued to bomb Iraq regularly for the past 10 years. The west may see itself as a beacon of freedom and opportunity, but many in the Muslim world see instead a supporter of a string of dictatorial Arab regimes such as Saudi Arabia and Egypt, an exporter of arms that are used against them, a home to a lack of morality and care for the elderly, and the driving force of consumerism, with all the ambivalence and contradictions such attitudes entail. While many want to own western products, few can afford to do so. The Beirut branch of McDonald's has queues round the block, though most can't pay for its burgers; in Ramallah earlier this year I saw a young boy wearing a T-shirt with a fake Nike swoosh, with the word "Nike" doctored out and replaced with "Hamas".  

<P>At the same time, people in the Middle East often have a distorted view of western culture - despite widespread family connections - and America's strengths, in particular: its grassroots democracy, its dynamism and inclusive sense of personal and civil liberties.  

<P>Meanwhile, the west can only see the Muslim world as something terrifyingly out of its control: a home to dictatorships, terrorism, repression and fanaticism - while knowing little of its history and cultural inheritance, sense of community and generosity in the face of poverty, and the west's own often malign influence on the region.  

<P>Furthermore, this mutual, and often willful, misunderstanding mirrors an alienation within our own culture: the loss of our collective spirit, which has developed as a product of our increasingly superficial and individualistic age. Now, as young and old New Yorkers queue up to donate their blood and chi-chi SoHo restaurants show signs saying "Free lunch for rescue workers", we are reminded of the powerful sense of community that so often emerges in adversity; and in the pride the famously hard-edged, individualist and tough   New Yorkers have taken in their collective response to their pain, we are reminded how much we long for the community we have lost.  

<P>There are few alive who have a memory of the horrors of the Somme; only those over 60 can recall the blitz; and those under 30 have only hazy memories of the cold war - whose battles, anyway, took place safely far away, in Korea, Vietnam, central America or southern Africa. For most in the west, our lives have been lived in comfort, the conviction of our own safety, the belief in our impenetrability.  

<P>But there is now a growing awareness of the price that has been paid for that prosperity. The decades of peace and accumulation of wealth in the west have not only been arguably bought at the expense of the rest of the world - but also of ourselves. The world's poor have suffered while the west has prospered - four fifths of the world's population lives in the developing world, but earn just 13% of its income - and the richest countries have bribed governments in the global south to privatize their commodities, expecting ordinary people to pick up the bill.  

<P>At home, we have become so defined by money, status and career success that we work ourselves into the ground. Perhaps it is no surprise that many assume the Muslim world's antipathy towards the west is down to envy of its wealth, when wealth is all we value in others. We have become so alienated from hunger that anorexia and obesity are epidemics; we take our health so for granted that we think mutilating our bodies will make us happy, with more than 7m people undergoing cosmetic surgery in the US last year alone. These are symbols of a west whose solipsism and individualism have eclipsed community.   

<P>And yet, we are desperate for it. When the Princess of Wales died in 1997, we huddled together in what now seems an absurd display of grief - when what we were really searching for was community and solidarity. We know that war would be terrible - though, for the many who have not seen it close up, we have no idea how terrible - but also how it can bring people together. We long for anything that will make us feel that we belong.  

<P>But community uncovered in adversity is fleeting, unless is has something real to sustain it. In a real community, we value what matters, not what makes most money. Our safety is even valued more than others' profit, and emergency workers are paid proper salaries, perhaps something closer to those of the Wall Street workers whose path to work they clear. And in a real community, those very Wall Street workers would not be traipsing through the dust back to the office less than a week after the attacks, saying things like: "I'd rather be with my wife and family, but they wanted us here." We would instead be listening to men like Alan Braker, who lost his ex-wife and their six-year-old daughter in the attacks. "We got divorced because I was a workaholic," said Mr Braker. "I would give everything up tomorrow to have them back." He found out too late, he said, what really mattered.  

<P>If we can hope for something positive from the grim reality of these days, it must surely be the chance to work for a better mutual understanding with the rest of the world, even the parts with which we can't do business; and to get away from the trivialization, commodification and disintegration of our collective life. It's not only the world's safety that's at stake - it's what kind of world it will become.</p>
