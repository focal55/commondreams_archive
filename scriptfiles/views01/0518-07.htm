San Juan, Puerto Rico, midnight, Wed/Thurs - 9/10 May 2001 -

This (Wednesday) morning I went to the federal court - the

U.S. District Court - on Calle Chardon, in Hato Rey, by

bicycle, to take some photos and to join the protest

demonstration supporting Ruben Berrios and the five people

arrested with him in the Vieques 'restricted zone', who were

being tried today for trespassing.



<p>For most of the five days they were in the Vieques

restricted area, Berrios and his companions were in the

bombing zone proper. I think Berrios and his group spent

more time hiding out in the actual bombing zone than anyone,

with the possible exception of Vieques Mayor D'amaso Serrano.

Recall that since a 500-pound live bomb released by a U.S.

Navy F-18 killed David Sanes, a civilian security guard

manning Observation Post number 1, just over two years ago,

the Navy has been forced to use non-explosive ordnance.

Impacts of 500-pound dummy bombs and heavy naval artillery

rounds are still quite violent, spreading shrapnel over

large areas.



<p>Berrios and his companions, as in other previous appearances

before the federal court, had already declared at the bail

hearing Tuesday, 01 April, they do not recognize the

jursidiction of the U.S. court in Puerto Rico, and had been

denied bail. It is reported that Magistrate Castellanos said

that as the defendants do not recognize "his" jurisdiction,

he does not recognize their right to bail. (Legally,

logically, this is obviously baloney. One published report

described Castellanos as having made the remark while

having a "tantrum." Separately, it is notable that

Chief Judge Laffite chose to go on vacation, for the first

occasion leaving a magistrate to try Vieques demonstrators.)



<p>To my dismay, my camera jammed after I took a single shot.

(The camera is a Nikon FM-2 single-lens reflex, highly

regarded as a backup for professional photographers on

tough assignments.)



<p>At the moment, huge loudspeakers mounted on the back of a

truck were blasting forth a message from Sen. Fernando Mart'in,

of the PIP, who was describing Berrios and his companions to be

in good spirits as they were about to be remanded to the

federal prison in Guaynabo. He urged the protesters to move now

to the vicinity of the federal prison, to continue the long

vigil there in support of the prisoners.



<p>Three tall spindly TV-link towers were sending video and audio

to their respective broadcast studios. Messages from the huge

loudspeakers had just announced that Ruben Berrios and one of his

companions - repeat 'offenders'  - had just been sentenced inside

the imposing building across the street from where some four- or

five-hundred protesters stood or marched - to serve four months

in prison. Berrios' other three companions had just been given

two-month sentences.



<p>As the message from the loudspeakers ended, the protesters began

singing La Borinque~na (original version), holding PIP flags and

clenched fists in the air. Giving up on the camera, having tried

all the tricks I know, I released it, allowing it to dangle from

my neck by its strap, and I moved a few steps to join the group

of protesters.



<p>Now, in the midst of the protesters, I too raised my clenched

hand, as they sang. With green-and-white PIP flags fluttering

in the cool breeze, in bright sunlight, and uniformed police

officers, standing between us and the court building, looking on,

the protesters came to the last line of the song: "La libertad,

la libertad... la libertad, la libertaaad!"



<p>When the song ended there was a palpable, erie, silence.



<p>It is notable that for the first time in my life I am

witnessing demonstrations where the local police officers, and

the government as well, are overwhelmingly partial to the

protesters. A group of local federal employees participate in

protests. I am told at least one retired Navy admiral supports

the protesters and the pro-Vieques movement. Of course, one

recalls, U.S. District Judge Carmen Consuelo Vargas de Cerezo,

a former chief judge of the U.S. District Court in Puerto Rico,

recused herself on 12 May 2000, just before Ruben Berrios was

to be tried on that occasion, with a strong public statement

supporting the Vieques protest movement.



<p>The sentences meted out by the U.S. District Court in previous

cases involving Vieques 'trespassing' have been blatantly

arbitrary, varying from individual to individual not according

to what the person has done, but  - apparently - according to

how famous the person is, and which of various judges is

seeing the case - ie, apparently according to public relations

considerations and personal notions of what is appropriate.



<p>High-ranking politicians, famous actors, a world-champion boxer,

got off lightly when a hundred or more protesters were cleared

en mass from the restricted zone on 04 May 2000, after spending

a year there to force a halt to the bombardments. (We'll see

what happens now, in the wake of the latest arrests, to U.S. Rep.

Gutierrez, of Chicago, when he's tried, if he's tried. He was

reportedly beaten after he was taken into custody - unusual

treatment for a high ranking U.S. official, who presumably

outranks those who were beating him, and who represent his own

government. I understand he looks 'very Latino' - perhaps the

reason he was treated badly. Norma Burgos, now a Puerto Rico

senator, formerly the Puerto Rico Secretary of State, after her

arrest, was subjected to a humiliating search of body cavities.

Though that 'search' was conducted by a female law-enforcement

official, there are said to have been male law-enforcement

officials present. On past occasions, detained women were

reportedly subjected to body-cavity searches by male

law-enforcement personnel.)



<p>Perhaps you know, President Bush has recently stated publicly the

U.S. Navy must leave Vieques. There is a rumor the Navy is defying

the president.



<p>A group of Amnesty International human rights investigators are

reportedly on their way here to investigate alleged violations of

human rights by law-enforcement (military and civilian) personnel

in the wake of the latest arrests.



<p>Now there is a permanent vigil at the federal prison in Guaynabo.

People are camping out there. Cars go by on the highway sounding

their horns and blinking their lights in support. The number of

campers may possibly grow from hundreds to thousands in coming

weeks.



<p>1430 hours AST, Friday - 18 May 2001

Yesterday and today (Friday) news is emerging that

Magistrate Castellanos is calling for Manuel Rodr'iguez

Orellana, a prominent PIP leader and one of the three

attorneys in Ruben Berrios' defense team, to be charged

with criminal contempt. Castellanos is reported to have

issued a request to Chief Judge Laffite that the charge be

filed. The utterance by Rodriguez Orellana while the court was

in session, at the end of the trial of Ruben Berrios, taken

from today's (Friday's) <El Nuevo D'ia>:



<p>"Su Señoría, sólo para que el acta refleje que las sentencias

que el tribunal acaba de imponer son sentencias políticas".



<p>(my translation:)

"Your Honor, only so that the record reflects that the

sentences just imposed by the court are political sentences."
