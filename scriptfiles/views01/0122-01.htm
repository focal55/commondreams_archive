"It's your money" has been a rallying cry of many political

leaders, including President Bush, to justify large tax cuts. Taxes, say

Bush and many libertarians, should always be regarded with

suspicion--they take people's hard-earned private property away--and

should be kept as low as possible.

<p>Although people who hold views like this often appeal to Adam Smith as

a patron saint of private property and the free market, Smith himself did

not share their view of taxation. It is instructive to see why.

<p>The alternative to the "it's your money" view begins by pointing out

that the money I pay in taxes is not really just "my" money. When I take

a job or start a business, I will make money only if I get significant

help from my society and my government. My efforts will fail if I am not

protected against theft and attack, if there are no decent roads to and

from my firm, if environmental blight or urban decay keeps people away

from my retail outlet or if the general population is so poorly educated,

ill or despairing that my firm can find no customers or good workers. In

this sense, my earnings are not purely "my" money. They are the product,

rather, of a collaborative effort between me and my neighbors and

political officials. And I owe some of the earnings back to the society

and government agencies that have helped me.

<p>It is this view, not Bush's view, that Smith endorsed. He wrote, in

his "Wealth of Nations": "The subjects of every state ought to contribute

toward the support of the government in proportion to their respective

abilities; that is, in proportion to the revenue which they respectively

enjoy under the protection of the state. The expense of government to the

individuals of a great nation is like the expense of management to the

joint tenants of a great estate, who are all obliged to contribute in

proportion to their respective interests in the state." Society creates

the conditions under which financial success is possible, Smith believed,

and has therefore a rightful claim to a share of that success.

<p>Smith thought, more generally, that it was foolish to talk as if there

were something suspicious about the fact that governments tax us.

Taxation comes with government. All governments must impose taxes on

their subjects, and since governments perform important services for all

of us, we should be just as willing to pay taxes as we are to pay for any

other service. In fact, Smith says, people are willing, even proud, to

pay taxes: "Every tax is to the person who pays it a badge, not of

slavery, but of liberty. It denotes that he is subject to government,

indeed, but that, as he has some property, he cannot himself be the

property of a master." Governments expand everyone's liberty, and the

fact that we pay taxes to support the government is but a sign and a

consequence of our freedom.

<p>Finally, one part of protecting liberty involves making sure that

there is as little poverty as possible. Great poverty breeds crime, which

interferes with everyone's liberty and of course prevents the poor

themselves from having the mental or material resources to act with full

freedom. Protecting freedom directly requires an investment at least in

public education and public health, especially for pregnant mothers and

young children. Smith supported using tax money for these kinds of

measures. Indeed, he gives express approval to progressive taxation,

recommending a higher road toll for luxury carriages than for freight

vehicles so that "the indolence and vanity of the rich" can be made to

contribute to "the relief of the poor."

<p>Adam Smith has been misread for generations, and it is not news to

scholars that he was a strong advocate for the poor. But it is disturbing

that the silly notion that taxes are some sort of infringement on private

property should be widespread two centuries after Smith died. It is yet

more disturbing that a person who is now president should have based his

campaign on this silly notion.
