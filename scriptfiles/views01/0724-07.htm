      paralysing traffic through Baltimore and sabotaging up the main

      eastern transport and cyber-artery of the United States, could

      have been carrying spent nuclear fuel rods. The clean-up wouldn't

      take weeks. It would take centuries. New Department of Energy

      regs allow for rail cars to carry lethal nuclear fuel.</font>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The nuclear industry is on

      full emergency alert after the Baltimore debacle. It knows that

      years of lobbying and propaganda about the &quot;safe&quot; transportation

      of nuclear waste could go down the tubes. Answering such fears

      Harry Reid of Nevada, number two Democrat in the US Senate and

      prime opponent of the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste plan, has

      pounced on the Baltimore disaster.</font></P>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In a Senate floor speech Thursday

      Reid said the crash in a Baltimore tunnel near Camden Yards baseball

      park should slow the &quot;mad clamor by the nuclear power industry

      to send nuclear waste somewhere. They don't care

      where it goes, but they have focused on Nevada for the present

      time. And I think everyone needs to recognize that transporting

      dangerous materials is very difficult,&quot; he said. &quot;The

      leaking hydrochloric acid in Baltimore is nothing compared to

      the high-level radioactive waste proposed for the Yucca Mountain

      site 100 miles northwest of Las Vegas. A speck the size of a

      pinpoint would kill a person. And we're talking about transporting

      some 70,000 tons of it across America.&quot;</font></P>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Reid told his fellow senators

      that an estimated 60 million people would be within 1 mile of

      the truck and rail routes proposed to ship waste to Yucca Mountain.

      &quot;What we should do with nuclear waste is leave it where

      it is,&quot; he said.</font></P>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The US Energy Department's high-level nuclear waste transportation

      route maps were released in January, 2000 as part of the Draft

      Environmental Impact Statement for a Geologic Repository at Yucca

      Mountain. These maps have been reviewed by the Nuclear Information

      &amp; Research Service. The irradiated nuclear fuel from Constellation

      Energy Group's (formerly Baltimore Gas &amp; Electric's) Calvert

      Cliffs nuclear plant located on the western shore of the Chesapeake

      Bay in Calvert County, Maryland could be carried by heavy haul

      truck to the nearest CSX railhead at Chalk Point (about 67 miles

      from Baltimore), then transported by train through Baltimore.

      The DOE route map for Maryland can be viewed on the Internet

      at: <A HREF="http://www.ymp.gov/timeline/eis/routes/routemaps.htm" target="new">http://www.ymp.gov/timeline/eis/routes/routemaps.htm</A></font></P>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The DOE map does not estimate

      how many containers of high-level nuclear waste would travel

      through Baltimore on the CSX. In a 1995 report, the State of

      Nevada Agency for Nuclear Projects identified the same railway

      through Baltimore as a potential high-level nuclear waste transport

      route from Calvert Cliffs' twin reactors. The 1995 Nevada report

      identified the rail route as belonging to Conrail: Conrail then

      merged with CSX in 1997. The Nevada study, &quot;High-Level Nuclear

      Waste Shipping Route Maps to Yucca Mountain and Shipment Number

      Estimates,&quot; reported that 180 rail casks from Calvert Cliffs

      could travel the CSX line through Baltimore and numerous States

      westward on its way to Yucca Mountain, Nevada. This map can be

      viewed on the Internet at <A HREF="http://www.state.nv.us/nucwaste/states/maryland.htm" target="new">http://www.state.nv.us/nucwaste/states/maryland.htm</A></font></P>

<P><font color="#990000" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">K</font><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">evin Kamps, nuclear waste specialist

      at Nuclear Information &amp; Resource Service estimates that

      &quot;Each of the 180 rail containers of atomic waste from Calvert

      Cliffs could hold one hundred times the long-lasting radiation

      released by the Hiroshima atomic bomb. Irradiated nuclear fuel,

      even decades after removal from the reactor, can deliver a lethal

      dose of radiation in a few minutes time&quot;, Kamps tells us.

      &quot;The only thing standing between people and deadly radiation

      is the nuclear waste transport container, which can be breached

      and release radiation in a severe accident.&quot;</font></P>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Baltimore Sun has reported

      that the fire in the train tunnel reached temperatures as high

      as 1,500 degrees Fahrenheit. The fire, apparently fed by flammable

      chemicals in the train cargo, burned out of control all day long,

      overnight, and well into the next day. &quot;The inadequate U.S.

      Nuclear Regulatory Commission design criteria for high-level

      nuclear waste containers only calls for casks to be able to withstand

      a 1,475 degree fire for 30 minutes&quot;, Kamps reports. &quot;Obviously,

      this real life accident in Baltimore surpassed the NRC's design

      criteria for containers that would hold deadly atomic waste.

      These outdated NRC criteria dates back to 1947, and haven't been

      updated since, despite combustibles on the roads and rails today

      that burn at much higher temperatures.&quot;</font></P>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Baltimore Sun quoted a

      firefighter as saying all he could see inside the tunnel was

      the glowing metal of train tanker cars. &quot;It was a deep orange,

      like a horseshoe just pulled out of the oven.&quot;</font></P>

<P>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

If it had been nuclear waste,

      that firefighter wouldn't be able to look inside the tunnel.

      If he did, it wouldn't be long before he was dead. Here at CounterPunch

      we're willing to bet that somewhere in the &quot;Terror Attack&quot;

      scenarios stacked up in FEMA and other government agencies is

      one involving tunnels up and down the east coast. Now they've

      got a real-life lesson smouldering right under their noses, not

      so far from where the British bombarded Ft. McHenry outside Baltimore

      in the war of 1812, thus provoking the composition of the Star

      Spangled Banner. Stormed at with shot and shell? How about &quot;glowing

      with nuclear waste&quot;.
