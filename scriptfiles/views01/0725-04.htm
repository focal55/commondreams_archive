Americans have had the feeling

for quite a while now that pharmaceutical companies are sticking it to them.

<p>Faced with accusations of price-gouging, Big Pharma’s refrain

has been, We need to make huge

profits because we spend so much

on research and development. The

industry tells us that were it not

for its beneficent R&D, which they

fund with those big profits, we

might never have seen some of the

drugs that have saved lives and

improved our quality of life.

<p>What they don’t say is what a

report a couple of years ago by the

Congressional Joint Economic

Committee pointed out: that several of the most important drugs

developed since the mid-’60s—

including Tamoxifin (for breast

cancer), AZT (for AIDS), Taxol

(for cancer), Prozac (for clinical

depression) and Capoten (for

hypertension)—were created

with the help of federally funded

research.

<p>They also don’t tell you what the

healthcare advocacy group Families USA reported last week: that

drug manufacturers spend twice

as much on advertising, marketing and administration as they

do on R&D.

<p>A close look at the 2000 annual

reports of the nine leading pharmaceutical companies revealed

information quite embarrassing

to Big Pharma. Families USA

discovered that industry giant

Merck & Co., which had $40.4

billion in net sales last year,

allocated 15 percent of its total

revenue to advertising, marketing

and administration costs, and a

mere 6 percent to R&D.

<p>BristolMyers Squibb Co., meanwhile, set aside 30 percent of total

revenue for marketing, advertising and administrative expenses, and 11 percent for developing

new or improved medications.

The two firms also racked up

net profits that more than doubled

their R&D budgets.

<p>The Families USA report

caused the drug industry to once

again repeat the argument that

record-breaking profits actually

serve the greater good. “When the

pharmaceutical industry does

well, patients do even better,” one

PR flack said.

<p>No one can deny that Big

Pharma is doing well these days.

Pharmaceutical manufacturers

represent the most profitable

sector of U.S. industry, according

to Families USA. Profit margins

for drug makers were four times

that of the average Fortune 500

company in 2000.

<p>But those fat profits aren’t

doing much to help older Americans at a time when the prices of

the 50 drugs they are most

commonly prescribed are rising

at more than twice the rate of

inflation.

<p>Big Pharma’s profiteering also

isn’t doing much for patients who

come to places like the Moss Free

Clinic in Fredericksburg, Va. The

residents who visit the clinic as a

last resort (they have no private

health insurance and do not

qualify for Medicaid or Medicare)

almost always need at least one

prescription.

<p>The clinic pharmacy can dispense free drug samples that

temporarily stave off calamity;

and if patients are able to jump

through all the bureaucratic

hoops and can wait two or three

months, they might even get

medication through drug companies’ indigent patient programs

(which are tax writeoffs for the

firms).

<p>But places like the Moss Clinic

can’t help everyone get the prescription drugs he or she needs.

Medicare patients (who number

40 million nationwide) are ineligible for the services offered at

free clinics, yet their benefits do

not cover prescription drugs.

Consequently, many seniors

and disabled people on Medicare

go without medications necessary

for their well-being.

<p>While these people certainly

aren’t doing “even better” as a

result of Big Pharma’s business

success—drug firms’ bigwigs

apparently are. The average compensation for the highest-paid

executive at each of the nine

companies included in the Families USA study came to almost $19

million last year.

<p>On top of this salary, these same

nine executives also have unexercised stock options that total

$890 million in value. C.M. Heimbold Jr., chairman of BristolMyers Squibb, is holding stock

options worth $228 million. That’s

$28 million more than the United

States has offered to pony up for a

new global fund to fight HIV/

AIDS and other infectious diseases that are ravaging poor

countries.

<p>But drug manufacturers don’t

just throw money at their head

honchos. They also see to it that

buckets of cash wind up with the

politicians who have the greatest

ability to affect drug companies’

bottom line.

<p>Rep. Bill Thomas, R-Calif., who

heads the House Ways and Means

Committee and as such may be the

most important member of Congress when it comes to legislation

concerning Medicare and prescription drugs, can count drug

makers Eli Lilly and Allergan as

his two top campaign contributors. And Sen. Bill Frist, R-Tenn.,

another major player in the

Medicare reform debate, was one

of Big Pharma’s top beneficiaries

during the 1999-2000 election cycle,

receiving more than $260,000.

<p>In all, the pharmaceutical and

health-products industry donated

more than $26 million in PAC, soft-money and individual contributions to federal candidates and

committees in 1999-2000, according

to the Center for Responsive

Politics.

<p>What do the drug companies

want for their money? They want

to make certain that their servants in Washington don’t get any

silly ideas—such as creating a

Medicare drug benefit that would

impose some form of price controls and thereby take a bite out of

their profits.

<p>Big Pharma is betting that the

money it has invested in our

politicians will enable it to continue bilking Americans. And

until we fix some of the ills that

afflict our political system, that

might be a safe bet.
