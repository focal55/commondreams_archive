In 1964, Kitty Genovese was murdered in New York City; for over half an hour 

she put up a desperate fight against her assailant, and 38 neighbors later 

reported hearing her ongoing screams for help. But no one helped - not one 

witness even so much as called the police. Neighbors later said that they 

had felt powerless and confused during the attack, and certain someone else 

would do something to stop it. So they had gone about their business 

instead, closing the windows to keep out the screams.



<p>Kind of the way many of us are coping with the war these days. The media 

bombard us with anthrax paranoia, patriotic military shots, and spokespeople 

who BS well but provide no coherent information. Cameras flash and pundits 

cheer as Bush attends a baseball game, bounces off Air Force One with his 

dog or delivers a canned speech, but intelligent discussions of the deeper 

implications of bombing Afghanistan are a mainstream news rarity. 

Unconscionable new domestic "collateral damage" developments float by each 

day - tax breaks for the rich, decimation of civil liberties, potential 

Arctic Refuge drilling, fast track trade agreements, what have you - but the 

sheer speed and enormity of the societal restructuring breed confusion and 

apathy. So we shut our windows and thoughts, absorbing the Emmys rather than 

the ugly reality of war.



<p>And then comes the US government's stepped-up assault to capture the hearts 

and minds of citizens at home and governments abroad. Much has already been 

made of the $3,500 per day contract given to the Rendon Group, a 

public-relations firm now charged with advising the US military on improving 

"public diplomacy" (i.e. propaganda) and countering opposition messages. The 

Pentagon's purchase of all rights to Ikonos satellite pictures of 

Afghanistan, pictures detailing massive civilian casualties, is another 

convenient way of keeping unpleasant realities away from the suggestible 

masses; the recent appointment of "The Queen of Madison Avenue" Charlotte 

Beers to Under-Secretary of State for Public Diplomacy and Public Affairs is 

similarly unsettling. From a prominent Texan oil family, Beers went on to 

chair two major advertising companies and her current assignment is no less 

than rebranding the United States. According to Colin Powell, not only is 

Beers "fluent with this sort of thing, but she is from the advertising 

business. I wanted one of the world's greatest advertising experts, because 

what are we doing? We're selling. We're selling a product. That product we 

are selling is democracy. It's the free enterprise system, the American 

value system." If it's good enough for Coke and deodorants, it's good enough 

for the US government.



<p>So the terrorist training camp known as School of the Americas continues to 

operate Stateside, but has changed its name to The Western Hemisphere 

Institute for Security Cooperation to fool those pesky protesters and retain 

US public funding. Why stop indoctrinating terrorism when you can just 

rebrand? In spite of its lofty name, the International Coalition Against 

Terror is mainly composed of the countries manufacturing and stockpiling 

most of the world's weapons of mass destruction. Bush continues to sell his 

rollback of civil liberties as "preventing more atrocities in the hands of 

the evil ones." Not to be outdone, a Department of Health and Human Services 

spokesperson defended his agency's much maligned handling of the anthrax 

crisis with, "Something that's factual at this moment proves not to be 

factual in retrospect. That doesn't mean it wasn't factual at the time." Any 

further questions?



<p>One of Beers' first branding projects was working with the Ad Council 

(formerly known as the War Advertising Council) on a series of commercials 

to "distill the values and virtues of American democracy." One spot, called 

"I am an American," features speakers of various ethnic backgrounds and 

invokes E PLURIBUS UNUM (Out of many, one) to show that "our diversity makes 

America great."



<p>Let's propose another Ad Council spot: "I am aware." It will show ordinary 

citizens across the United States, indeed across the world, rising up to 

combat the societal rollback taking place in the name of supposedly fighting 

terrorism. It will invoke common sense in realizing that dropping bombs on a 

ravaged people and promoting mass starvation does not induce peace. It will 

show that diversity makes the whole world great, and that the actions of a 

single person from afar can sometimes mean the difference between life and 

death for another.



<p>Brand that.
