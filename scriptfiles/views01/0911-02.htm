WASHINGTON -- Atop the power structure in the nation's capital, there are two types of politicians -- those who work hard to be loved and those who prefer to be feared.
<p>When Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, announced last week that he would not seek re-election in 2002, there wasn't a wet eye in the house, except for his own. Gramm has always relied on the fear factor to get his way, and most of the time it has worked rather well.</p>
<p>Few will miss him. Gramm didn't earn the nickname "Grammstander" by being polite and charming.</p>
<p>When major political figures leave the national stage and are no longer active in ideological combat, it is customary to gloss over their public sins and turn them into statesmen. But Gramm is going to vote on some very volatile issues for another 16 months, and it is too early to drop the cloak of bipartisan political invisibility over him. He can still cause a lot of trouble.</p>
<p>It is useful to remember that a former colleague once observed tartly: "When you're dealing with Gramm, there are two things you've got to remember. No. 1, he's smarter than you are. No. 2, he's meaner than a junkyard dog." The remark was so accurate it has entered the lexicon of famous Washington quotes and is often repeated.</p>
<p>In 23 years in politics, Gramm built a reputation as a tightfisted budget-cutter who fought to reduce the size of the federal government and get rid of social programs that he views as wasteful handouts for freeloaders. His blacklist included the Department of Education, which he crusaded to abolish on the astonishing theory that governments have no business encouraging reading, writing and arithmetic.</p>
<p>At the same time, however, he brags about all the costly federal benefits he has provided for Texas, sometimes taking credit for projects that were passed over his opposition. "I'm carrying so much pork I'm beginning to get trichinosis," he once boasted.</p>
<p>A particularly outrageous example of this was his stubborn campaign for a billion-dollar superconducting supercollider, a scientific monstrosity that would have been built in Texas. Congress eventually killed it as too expensive and too marginally useful.</p>
<p>His anti-government attitude reached a fever pitch when the federal bureaucracy closed down over a budget stalemate for 21 days in late 1995 and early 1996. He happened to be running for president at the time, and he chortled in a television interview that this was a great thing. "Have you missed the government?" he scoffed, grinning hugely. "Doesn't it strike you funny that ... large segments of the government are shut down?"</p>
<p>Actually, it didn't strike anyone in his or her right mind as funny. Federal workers and private contractors weren't paid; services collapsed as nobody processed Medicare claims or provided federal prison services, State Department security and other essential functions. Parks were closed, and federal block grants for programs run by the states were suspended. The government lost millions because the airline passenger tax and other fees could not be collected.</p>
<p>Then-Speaker Newt Gingrich and the intransigent congressional Republicans got the blame for the financial fiasco. Gramm's reaction played a substantial role in identifying his party as unreasonably hostile to the accommodations that enable a government to function.</p>
<p>Through seniority and smart backstage maneuvering, Gramm became a power in the Senate, rising to become chairman of the Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee, a post he lost this spring when legislative control shifted to the Democrats. His 1996 bid to dominate the GOP's conservative faction and become the party's presidential nominee, however, was a disaster.</p>
<p>Thanks mostly to the banking, insurance and energy industries and other special-interest groups, Gramm raised more money during his mercifully brief candidacy than any other candidate in the same period.</p>
<p>"I have the most reliable friend that you can have in American politics, and that is ready money," he crowed. But it turned out that the most reliable friends were the voters, and he didn't have many. </p>
<p>But Texas allows candidates to run simultaneously for statewide office and the presidency, and he was re-elected to the Senate that fall.</p>
<p>Although his initial emphasis was upon balancing the federal budget and cutting taxes, during his presidential campaign Gramm joined the conservative tide refocusing GOP politics on cultural and moral issues. He blamed the federal government for a decline in morality and ethics, charging that "programs like welfare have corrupted the values and destroyed the virtues of too many Americans." Those programs, of course, also kept millions of unfortunate people out of poverty and helped to provide nutrition, education and housing.</p>
<p>For a senator who believes that government is "a corrosive influence" Gramm has never had a problem accepting federal help for himself. He was born in a government hospital, educated by his father's G.I. insurance, put through graduate school by a National Defense Education Act fellowship, and taught economics at Texas A&M University assisted by a development grant from the National Science Foundation. Since his election to the House in 1978, he has been on the government payroll. His wife, Wendy, has also held federal jobs. </p>
<p>But as Gramm prepares to leave, he is content with who he is. "I did not come to Washington to be loved," he once said. "And I have not been disappointed." </p>
