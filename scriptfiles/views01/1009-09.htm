Americans, we're told, must now unite behind the president. Yet the Bush

administration is itself divided by a struggle between pragmatists and

hardliners. It will likely remain so as its responses to the terrible

attacks of September 11 continue to evolve. These divisions could give the

voices of ordinary citizens a key role in influencing critical decisions.

But only if we find the courage to speak out.



<p>So far, we've watched from the sidelines, angry, mourning, and

shell-shocked, while Bush's advisors debate their responses. Congressional

Democrats have been silent as well, politically cowed. Meanwhile, Colin

Powell and national security advisor Condoleeza Rice advocate for creating

as broad an international alliance as possible, and pursuing specific

delimited goals of bringing those responsible to justice. At the same time,

others, like secretary of defense Donald Rumsfield, assistant secretary of

defense Paul Wolfowitz, and long-time Cold Warriors Richard Perle, Jeane

Kirkpatrick, and Bill Kristol, are arguing for attacks against regimes from

the Taliban to Iraq, Iran, and Syria, as well as radical groups in Lebanon

and the West Bank. During the Reagan era, this same group pioneered the

theology of winnable nuclear wars and (along with Bush's new U.N.

ambassador, John Negroponte) spearheaded U.S. support for a disturbing array

of dictators and government-sponsored death squads. Now, as Powell and some

of the Pentagon generals have pointed out, they risk igniting the entire

Islamic world against us.



<p>The risks are real. Think of Iran, and the delicate path that reformer

Mohammad Khatami is pursuing toward democratization. Bomb enough Islamic

civilians, and his already-beleaguered regime will fall, replaced by the

Ayatollahs. Think of Pakistan, with its nuclear capabilities and

fundamentalists eager to topple a military government. If we further the

cycle of indiscriminate violence, we'll only incite more terrorists.



<p>For the moment, Powell's position seems to be prevailing, but as the bombs

begin to fall, and given the historical antagonism between him and Dick

Cheney, and the Bush administration's consistent pursuit of rightwing

policies in its first six months, we should take nothing for granted. So for

all the calls to simply "support the president," it may be the voices of

everyday citizens that determine which views prevail, and whether these

terrible events are the last of their kind, or the beginning of still more

brutal cycles of vengeance. As citizens, we may feel an impulse to defer

responsibility, to say we don't know enough, or it's not our place to speak

out. We may be intimidated by Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer's bullying

warning, about Politically Incorrect host Bill Maher, that Americans "need

to watch what they say, watch what they do." But with the stakes so high, we

can't afford to be silent. If we have reservations against responding to

these unconscionable attacks with our own indiscriminate violence, we need

to speak out now, to prevent our government from embarking on paths that

will bring neither security nor justice.



<p>The polls show support for Bush's responses so far, but not for unlimited

retaliation. From conversations I've had in some of the most conservative

regions of the country, many who praise Bush do so specifically because they

view his reactions as restrained, though it seems to me a grave mistake that

he refused to even entertain those rituals of discussion that might have

allowed the Taliban to both comply with our demands and save face. Americans

want our government to apprehend those who created these attacks-but not to

embark on a global "Crusade" that could far too easily become a global war.



<p>If we do speak out and demand that our elected representatives to do the

same, we'll have at least a chance of helping to shape public debate in

wiser directions-like stopping the continued buildup of  a missile defense

system that would not have protected us from the terrible attacks of

September 11, and would not protect us in the future. We might work to

combine Powell's doctrine of multilateral intervention with policies that

develop genuine global justice and democracy, and refuse to cannibalize the

earth. We need to reject approaches that risk seeding the ground for future

bitter harvests of destruction.



<p>We'd do well to recall, in this context, that our leaders, including Bush

senior, helped arm and train Osama bin Laden and promote Afghan opium

production as part of our support for the anti-Soviet Mujahideen. They

backed Saddam Hussein and his Baathist Party as a counterweight to Iran,

whose Ayatollah came to power as leader of the only force capable of

overthrowing the brutal Shah. The United States had supported the Shah since

our CIA installed him in 1953, after overthrowing an elected prime minister

who'd dared to talk of nationalizing oil.  Few Americans even know about the

estimated one million Iraqis who have died because the Gulf War and our

continuing embargo have destroyed their most basic health and sanitation

systems. But to the Islamic world, their deaths are an open wound. Unless we

create a more just world, desperate men from voiceless communities will

continue to destroy more innocent lives, here and abroad.



<p>If we choose to participate in marches and vigils, we can't afford to be

self-righteous. We've got to stay humble. The CIA played a role in the chain

of events that made possible these terrible attacks, but chanting "CIA

kills" sounds as if we place a higher priority on gloating and being proven

right in our opposition than in recognizing how profoundly America is now

stunned and wounded. We need to make clear that we as well want their

perpetrators brought to justice. And we need to make our views

heard--whether through marching, writing letters, making phone calls, or

initiating discussion and debate in our local churches and temples, PTAs,

city council meetings, Rotary Clubs, and with coworkers, neighbors, and

friends.



<p>We can never know every facet of this situation, nor every detail of how our

government responds. We may not know whether our actions will prevail. But

we need to say what we think, even if it ends up drawing heat. This means

reaching out to those who disagree with us on how to respond to this brutal

cataclysm. It means acting with enough faith and strength to keep on raising

the difficult questions, demanding paths that give our nation a chance to

break the endless cycles of vengeance. For the more difficult the times, the

more true patriotism means taking responsibility for our government's

actions.
