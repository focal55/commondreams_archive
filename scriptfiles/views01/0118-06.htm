As contention over President-elect George W. Bush's nominations for

Labor and Justice grabs the headlines, it is important that Gale Norton's

nomination for secretary of the Interior not fly under the radar.

Norton's role as a lobbyist for NL Industries, previously known as

National Lead Co., is a terrifying harbinger of what may befall the

nation if the Senate confirms her.

<p>National Lead is responsible for what is perhaps the nation's most

devastating children's health crisis. For decades, National Lead promoted

and distributed millions of gallons of lead-based paint under its "Dutch

Boy" brand name. Lead paint has led to the death and brain damage of

thousands of children.

<p>That Norton lobbied for a company that pushed for toxic lead paint to

the point where it covers the walls of a major portion of our housing

stock, particularly in urban areas and older suburbs, at best indicates

an extraordinary ignorance of the corporate cultures within which she

works. At worst, it shows a dangerous bias for the worst polluters of the

American environment.

<p>National Lead's irresponsible corporate culture is not something that

Norton could have missed, for it extends deep into the history of the

company. By the mid-1920s, numerous cases of lead paint intoxication

among infants and toddlers, resulting in severe brain damage and even

death, were documented in the medical literature.

<p>Despite this, NL Industries worked hard to popularize the use of lead

paint through a direct marketing campaign aimed at young children.

Through the use of its Dutch Boy logo, the nation was, for decades,

lulled into a false sense of security about the safety of lead paint on

walls, woodwork and window sills with which children constantly came in

contact.

<p>National Lead began a campaign that sought to, in the words of one of

its early marketing ads, "cater to the children." In thousands of ads,

brochures and visits to schools, 4-H Clubs and hospitals, the company

joined with its trade association, the Lead Industries Assn., to

counteract negative publicity. Most pernicious were the children's paint

books distributed free to children. Children were encouraged to read the

poems that accompanied the illustrations of the Dutch Boy riding on bars

of lead, playing with lead soldiers, mixing white lead with colors, and

painting children's toys, furniture and bedroom walls.

<p>In the 1930s and 1940s as well, the company spent hundreds of

thousands of dollars in advertising, promotion and lobbying efforts to

make sure that "pure white lead" was insulated from the growing chorus of

voices calling for its elimination from the interior of houses. National

Lead encouraged teachers and parents to "get after the school trustees to

have each room repainted" with "flat paint made of Dutch Boy white-lead

and flatting oil." In another more poignant promotion, Dutch Boy shows a

crawling infant touching a painted wall: "There is no cause for worry

when fingerprint smudges or dirt spots appear on a wall painted with

Dutch Boy white-lead," the ad reassures parents.

<p>The Dutch Boy Painter, a periodical published by National Lead,

carried an article during the Depression on using lead paint to stencil

"humorous designs such as cartoons, caricatures and pictorials in

recreation rooms, game rooms, bars, etc. . . . for use in nurseries,

kindergartens, play rooms and other places where children gather."

<p>Throughout its history, National Lead proudly bragged of the success

of its marketing campaign to children. This marketing of the Dutch Boy

image was an essential element of National Lead's profitability and the

rise of its sales from $80 million in 1939 to more than $320 million in

1948.

<p>National Lead and its trade association, the LIA, encouraged shifting

responsibility for this tragedy from lead paint to the parents and

children themselves. They shaped the research agendas of scientists and

intimidated researchers who identified lead paint as the source of

children's learning disorders.

<p>When medical and public opinion were so great that it could not deny

the link between lead paint and childhood lead poisoning, the LIA

promoted the idea that poisoned children suffered from a preexisting

condition called pica--a "morbid craving" for lead paint chips. Similarly

it argued that parents living in slum dwellings were responsible for not

properly supervising their children and not maintaining clean homes.

<p>For many decades to come, we will continue to see thousands of

children entering our emergency rooms with the symptoms of lead

poisoning. If Norton is ignorant of this company's seedy history, then it

is frightening indeed that she might be in charge of overseeing the use

of our nation's mineral resources and public lands and protecting the

public from other irresponsible industries intent on exploiting the world

we live in for their own profit.
