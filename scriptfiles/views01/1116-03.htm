In a recent interview with the Pakistani newspaper Dawn, Osama bin Laden

justified the killing of innocent Americans this way :



<p>"If an enemy occupies a Muslim territory and uses common people as human

shield, then it is permitted to attack that enemy. For instance, if

bandits barge into a home and hold a child hostage, then the child's

father can attack the bandits and in that attack even the child may get

hurt. America and its allies are massacring us in Palestine, Chechnya,

Kashmir and Iraq. The Muslims have the right to attack America in

reprisal."



<p>That's the traditional justification for killing, isn't it?



<p>They kill us, we kill them, they kill us, we kill them.



<p>What ever happened to "thou shalt not kill"?



<p>Equally unimpressive is President Bush's justification for killing: we

are in a war with terror.



<p>Okay, then what about terror committed by us?



<p>We kill innocents, they kill innocents. It's all terror.



<p>Last week, Bush said we don't target innocent civilians.



<p>Oh yeah? What about the nuclear attack on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, or the

fire bombing of Dresden? What about U.S. support in the 1980s for the

contra war in Nicaragua, and the CIA mining of Nicaraguan ports --

actions which killed thousands and led to a judgment against the United

States at the World Court?



<p>Civilian targeting, and terror, pure and simple.



<p>Most despicable are those in our media, who sit comfortably in their

modern offices, staring at their computers, and hit the keys advocating

more killing of innocents thousands of miles away.



<p>Here's our short ten worst list, in order of repulsiveness:



<p>Michael Kelly (Washington Post): "American pacifists … are on the side

of future mass murders of Americans," they are "objectively

pro-terrorist," "evil" and "liars."



<p>Jonathan Alter (Newsweek): Wondered whether torture would "jump-start

the stalled investigation into the greatest crime in American history."

Urges pacifists to shut up because "it's kill or be killed."



<p>Bill O'Reilly (Fox TV): "The US should bomb the Afghan infrastructure to

rubble -- the airport, the power plants, their water facilities, the

roads. … The Afghans are responsible for the Taliban. We should not

target civilians, but if they don't rise up against this criminal

government, they starve, period."



<p>A.M. Rosenthal (Washington Times): In addition to Afghanistan, wants to

bomb Iraq, Libya, Sudan, Iran, and Syria.



<p>Ann Coulter (ex-National Review): Her response to terrorism is to

"invade their countries, kill their leaders, and convert them to

Christianity."



<p>Steve Dunleavy (New York Post) " "The response to this unimaginable

21st-century Pearl Harbor should be as simple as it is swift -- kill the

bastards. …  A gunshot between the eyes, blow them to smithereens,

poison them if you have … As for cities or countries that host these

worms, bomb them into basketball courts."



<p>Rich Lowry (National Review): "If we flatten part of Damascus or Tehran

or whatever it takes, that is part of the solution."



<p>Charles Krauthammer (Washington Post): "We are fighting because the

bastards killed 5,000 of our people, and if we do not kill them, they

are going to kill us again."



<p>Thomas Friedman (New York Times): "We have to fight the terrorists as if

there were no rules." And the perverted "give war a chance."



<p>George Will (Washington Post): "The Bush administration is telling the

country that there is some dying to be done. ... The goal is not to

'bring terrorists to justice,' which suggests bringing them into sedate

judicial settings -- lawyers, courtrooms, due process, all preceded by

punctilious readings of Miranda rights. Rather, the goal is destruction

of enemies."



<p>Of course, the peace voices have been shunned by the big media

corporations.



<p>After September 11, Clear Channel, the nation's largest owner of radio

stations, sent out an internal memorandum with a list of songs the

stations were not to play, including John Lennon's "Imagine."



<p>In response, Lennon's widow, Yoko Ono, took out a full page ad in the

New York Times with eight words from the song: "Imagine all the people

living life in peace."



<p>Then she took out a billboard on Time Square that said: "Give Peace a

Chance."



<p>"What John wrote is a very strong and beautiful message," Ono said. "I

think they (Clear Channel) wanted everyone to be in a kind of attack

mode."



<p>John Lennon: "Give Peace a Chance."



<p>Thomas Friedman: "Give War a Chance."



<p>You decide.
