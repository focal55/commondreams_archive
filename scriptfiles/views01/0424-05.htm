I never thought I'd be writing this article, surely not in Canada.

<P>There aren't many people in this country who view free trade as positively as I do. As industry minister in the Mulroney government, I participated in the 1985 Shamrock Summit that set the stage for our trade agreement with the United States. I was even responsible for replacing the Foreign Investment Review Agency with Investment Canada, a welcome mat for our partners to the South.</P>

<P>There also aren't many people who view the maintenance of law and order as a higher priority than I do.</P>

<P>But this past weekend, I was shocked by events in Quebec City. Shocked by what I saw, and stunned by what my wife, Noreen, and I personally experienced.</P>

<P>I believe Canada is right to view free trade as a model for democratic development in every corner of our hemisphere, and I was delighted to see us host the Summit of the Americas. But our government is dead wrong to behave in a manner that suggests we have forgotten what democracy is all about.</P>

<P>Noreen and I arrived in Quebec City last Friday at about 5 p.m. We had heard about the so-called security fence and wanted to see it firsthand, to walk along beside it. My first view of the fence was in front of the Ch&#226;teau Frontenac. It brought back memories of many happy visits to that hotel. But, this weekend, I could not enter: The hotel was inside the fence, I was outside.</P>

<P>As we walked around the perimeter, a 40-year-old chap passed us, and asked: &#34;Where is your gas mask?&#34; I asked what he meant. He said: &#34;There is gas farther on -- watch out.&#34; We continued until we saw our first contingent of riot-geared police lined up three deep behind a closed gate. They were an intimidating sight -- in battle dress, with helmets, masks, shields and assorted elaborate weapons. I was glad, this time, that they were inside the fence and we were outside.</P>

<P>Farther on, just before we got to Dufferin Street, there were perhaps 50 people -- protesters, it turned out -- who were standing or sitting on a small side road. At the end of the road, we saw a much larger group of riot police standing shoulder-to-shoulder, several rows deep. The road was well away from the security fence. In fact, the fence was nowhere in sight.</P>

<P>I spoke with many of the people in the street, asked them why they had gathered, why they opposed the free trade proposals. It was a lively but friendly exchange.</P>

<P>We were interrupted as the police down the road began an eerie drumming, rattling their riot sticks against their shields. Slowly, in unison, one six-inch step at a time, they began marching toward us. Noreen and I moved to the side of the street, as the protesters remained stationary. Some formed V signs with their fingers.</P>

<P>To my horror, the police then fired tear gas canisters directly at those sitting or standing on the road.</P>

<P>As clouds of gas began to spread, Noreen and I felt our eyes sting and our throats bake. We pulled whatever clothing we could across our mouths. One young woman, who had been among the protesters, offered us some vinegar. &#34;What's that for?&#34; I asked. &#34;It takes away the sting,&#34; she said. And it did help.</P>

<P>The police, however, kept advancing. One large policeman with the number 5905 on his helmet, pressed right against me and ordered me to get behind a railing. &#34;I haven't done anything,&#34; I protested. &#34;Why?&#34; He simply replied: &#34;Get behind the rail.&#34; Then he added, &#34;and get down.&#34; I did so.</P>

<P>I shook my head. I never thought I would ever see this kind of police-state tactic in Canada. What we witnessed that night was mild compared to events the next afternoon.</P>

<P>This time, walked along the fence until we reached the gate at Ren&#233; L&#233;vesque Boulevard, where a great crowd had gathered that included TV cameras and reporters. I was asked for an interview by a CBC crew but, before we could begin, dozens of tear gas canisters were fired, water cannons were sprayed and rubber bullets began to hit people nearby. Three times, I felt could not breathe, my eyes were sore and all I could do was run. In the bedlam, my wife and I were separated for almost three hours. She said she had almost passed out from the gassing.</P>

<P>We lost something else, besides each other, last weekend in Quebec: our innocence. This government, and some reporters, like to brand the Quebec City demonstrators as &#34;hooligans.&#34; That is not fair. I talked to dozens of them, mostly university students, aged about 20. They came to Quebec, not to have &#34;a good time,&#34; as some suggest, but to express their well-thought-out views on a subject that is important to them, to all of us.</P>

<P>I may not have agreed with their position, but I sure believe in their right to express it. The police had no cause to violently suppress it.</P>

<P>Some will say that a handful of demonstrators got out of hand and forced the police to take collective action. I can't agree. The police action in Quebec City, under orders from our government, was a provocation itself -- an assault on all our freedoms.

<P><I>Sinclair Stevens, minister of regional industrial expansion under Brian Mulroney, was an MP from 1972 to 1988.</I>
