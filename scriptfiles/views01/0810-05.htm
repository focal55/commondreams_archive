The <a href="http://www.akaerospace.com/klc/index.html" target="_new">Kodiak 
              Launch Complex</a> was marketed to Alaskans as one of the nation's 
              first commercial space ports. Many promises were made to lure public 
              support: High-paying, year-round jobs. Better roads. A fancy cultural 
              center. New schools with real astronauts helping out in the classrooms. 
              Peace and prosperity. 
<p>The whole multibillion-dollar project, located on Narrow Cape, 
              a remote tip of Kodiak Island 250 miles west of Anchorage, was supposed 
              to be run by a state-chartered outfit called the <a href="http://www.akaerospace.com/" target="_new">Alaska 
              Aerospace Development Corporation.</a> In 1996, the state and the 
              feds turned over 3,500 acres of public land for the project, which 
              would house two launching pads, a space vehicle assembly plant, 
              a radar station, a command center and other support facilities. 
              Its backers claimed that a new age of commercial space traffic was 
              dawning, and that Kodiak Island was one of the world's best locations 
              for "launching telecommunications, remote sensing, and space science 
              payloads" into orbit. </p>
            <p>Local skeptics weren't thrilled at the prospect of their wilderness 
              redoubt being transformed into an Alaskan Cape Canaveral. After all, Kodiak was already 
            one of Alaska's most popular tourist destinations, with tens of thousands 
            of people coming to fish for salmon and halibut, hike the wilderness, 
            photograph the great grizzlies and view one of the few thriving populations 
            of gray whales in the Pacific--people who might think twice about 
            visiting with missiles screaming overhead. Others worried their villages 
            might be vulnerable to misfires and toxic fallout. Some wondered how 
            Kodiak, one of the most remote islands in North America, could possibly 
            be the epicenter of a profitable commercial enterprise. There were 
            suspicions that something a bit more nefarious might be in the offing. 
            <p>These concerns were briskly swept aside by state and federal officials. 
              A brief environmental analysis was slapped together, with much of 
              the data concealed from public scrutiny, and construction began 
              in 1998. Not long thereafter, the Alaska Aerospace Development Corporation 
              announced it was having financial problems, and the federal government 
              came to its rescue with a timely handout and the promise of sustained 
              appropriations. But there was a catch: Instead of sending into orbit 
              commercial satellites and the cremated remains of rich Trekkies, 
              the Kodiak site was going to work very closely with the Air Force 
              and its legion of defense contractors. </p>
            
<p>There's some compelling evidence that this was the plan all along, 
              starting with the man tapped to head the Alaska Aerospace Development 
              Corporation: Pat Ladner, a former Air Force lieutenant colonel who 
              served in the '80s as the program manager for a secretive project 
              called the Single Stage Rocket Technology Program (SSTR). This program 
              was a component of the initial burst of funding for Reagan's version 
              of Star Wars. But by the early '90s, with public and congressional 
              support lagging, the Pentagon made a decision to "privatize" much 
              of the development and testing for many of its Star Wars projects. 
              Ladner retired from the Air Force in 1993 and joined the Alaska 
              Aerospace Development Corporation. The facilities at Kodiak were 
              designed by the <a href="http://www.darpa.mil/" target="_new">Defense Advanced 
              Research Project Agency,</a> the same shadowy wing of the Pentagon 
              that had supervised the SSTR program on Ladner's watch. </p>
            <p>So the launching pads at Narrow Cape turned out to be just another 
              off-shoot of the National Missile Defense program. On November 5, 
              1998 the Kodiak site fired off its first rocket, an experimental 
              Air Force missile that is part of the Pentagon's "atmospheric interceptor 
              technology program." The rocket arced across the sky for more than 
              1,000 miles before slamming into the Pacific somewhere off the southern 
              Oregon coast. A second rocket was launched from Kodiak on September 
              15, 1999. </p>
            <p>Since those initial launches, a steady stream of Star Wars experiments 
              have been ongoing at Kodiak, projects steered there by the guiding 
              hand of Sen. Ted Stevens, the ranking member of the Appropriations 
              Committee. Stevens is a master at manipulating the flow of federal 
              dollars back to military projects in Alaska, often as last-minute 
              amendments to Defense Supplemental Appropriations bills, where they 
              receive little public scrutiny. This is how Star Wars has continued 
              almost uninterrupted since its inception in 1983. The next round 
              of tests at Kodiak will involve a much more potent and unnerving 
              rocket, a Polaris missile packed with a payload of simulated nuclear 
              warheads. Sometime in August, a Polaris will be fired from Kodiak 
              and streak 4,300 miles to Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands 
              of the South Pacific, where interceptor missiles will try to shoot 
              it down. Over the next five years, Kodiak is slated to launch more 
              than 20 Polaris rockets. (The other Polaris launching site is on 
              the Hawaiian island of Kauai.) </p>
            
<p>Even though the test rockets only pack simulated nukes, they are 
              still dangerous. The missiles' three-stage booster engines carry 
              highly toxic materials, including magnesium, hydrazine and radioactive 
              thorium. The boosters fall to the ocean and are not recovered. The 
              exhaust trail itself leaves behind a poisonous plume of smoke. "Each 
              rocket first stage releases a minimum of 8,000 pounds of aluminum 
              oxide at lift-off," warns Brad Stevens (no relation to the senator), 
              a biologist with the <a href="http://www.afsc.noaa.gov/" target="_new">National 
              Marine Fisheries Service</a> in Kodiak. "Much of this will wind 
              up in local streams that drain into Twin Lakes and the Fossil Beach 
              tidepools and kelp beds, which provide nutrients and shelter for 
              juvenile marine species. Documented fish kills in waterways around 
              Cape Kennedy attest to the fact that rocket emissions can destroy 
              aquatic life." (Also under the flight path of the missiles are rocky 
              beaches on small islands that serve as haul-outs for Stellar sea 
              lions, an endangered species.) </p>
            <p>One of the launch trajectories will send missiles over the fishing 
              villages of Akhiok and Old Harbor and across one of the world's 
              most pristine salmon spawning grounds. The Pentagon has told the 
              people living there not to worry: They will clear the waters of 
              boats before each launch and build two hardened bunkers in each 
              town. The bunkers serve as stark reminders that the townspeople 
              not only are potential victims of an accident, but a target of Russian 
              and Chinese defense systems designed to counter Star Wars. </p>
            
<p>Alaskans are old hands at this by now. Indeed, there's a grim irony 
              in the fact that Alaska, the most frigid of states, has been one 
              of the most ravaged battlegrounds of the Cold War. Over the past 
              55 years, Alaska has witnessed: early warning radar erected onto 
              the fragile tundra in the early '50s; the intentional irradiation 
              of more than 100 unwitting Alaskan native peoples in 1955 to test 
              the acclimation of humans to sub-zero temperatures; Project Chariot, 
              a mad scheme to excavate a naval harbor at Cape Thompson by exploding 
              five nuclear bombs at the mouth of a coastal creek (the bombs were 
              never detonated, but the site was left a toxic and radioactive mess); 
              and the Cannikin nuclear test in 1971, one of the largest ever, 
              which permanently contaminated Amchitka Island and continues to 
              ooze radioactive debris into the Bering Sea. Kodiak alone already 
              suffers from 17 toxic dumps left by previous Pentagon operations 
              on the island. Even the push to transform the <a href="http://arctic.fws.gov/" target="_new">Arctic 
              National Wildlife Refuge</a> into a forest of oil derricks has lately 
              been justified on the grounds of national security. </p>
            <p>So it shouldn't come as much of a surprise that Alaska seems poised 
              to bear the brunt of Bush's new Star Wars plan. The Kodiak site 
              is just one of more than a dozen enclaves of assorted anti-missile 
              paraphernalia that will be scattered across the state, from the 
              Aleutians to the Arctic plains. In addition to Kodiak, Congress 
              approved the construction of a $500 million radar dome on remote 
              Shemya Island in the Aleutians. Shemya, the site of an old CIA listening 
              post, is more than 1,500 miles from the nearest active military 
              base. A top Pentagon official told the <i>Washington Post</i> that 
              it posed difficult construction problems, and that when completed 
              the site would be "very, very vulnerable" to attack. </p>
            <p>Ted Stevens also has pushed to make Fort Greely Military Reserve, 
              an Army outpost on the Tanana River about 90 miles southeast of 
              Fairbanks, a base for the 100 interceptor missiles once the Stars 
              Wars scheme becomes operational. Constructed in 1945, Fort Greely 
              already has a dark history as a kind of outdoor laboratory for some 
              of the Army's most malign experiments. In 1953, the Army authorized 
              the use of Fort Greely and the adjacent Gerstle River Proving Ground 
              to test chemical and biological weapons. Of course, these operations 
              were kept secret from the surrounding population of homesteaders, 
              miners, trappers and the Goodpastor tribe of Athabaskan Indians. 
            </p>
            <p>In the early '60s one of the biological weapons tests went terribly 
              wrong, and 21 people were infected with tularemia. After the Army 
              stopped testing chemical and biological weapons at the site, it 
              did a cursory cleanup and buried most of the contaminated canisters 
              and shell-casings in shallow pits next to the river and several 
              lakes and ponds, where the lethal detritus continues to seep out. 
            </p>
            
<p>In 1962, the Army built a small nuclear reactor at Fort Greely, 
              which it claimed was needed as a power station. This claim proved 
              to be an elaborate cover. The reactor did generate some electricity, 
              but it also produced weapons-grade plutonium. The background of 
              this project is revealed in a startling report released last year 
              by physicist Norm Buske and Pam Miller, director of <a href="http://www.akaction.net/" target="_new">Alaska 
              Community Action on Toxics.</a> Among their findings: The Army dumped 
              nuclear waste into Jarvis Creek for 10 years; disposed of liquid 
              radioactive waste into groundwater that was used as a drinking source 
              by the village of Clearwater; and used radioactive steam from the 
              reactor to heat the military base. "Army leaders were more committed 
              to producing special nuclear materials for battlefield nuclear weapons 
              than they were to assuring the safety of the operation," Buske and 
              Miller concluded. </p>
            <p>Fort Greely was slated for decommissioning as part of the military's 
              base-closure program. A convincing theory holds that Stevens and 
              the Pentagon want to transform this Arctic outpost into the deployment 
              site for 100 interceptor missiles as a convenient way to disguise 
              the extent of the contamination and to evade accountability for 
              what went on up there through the '60s. </p>
            <p>What's more, Fort Greely site is a major sticking point with the 
              Russians and Chinese. Under the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, each 
              nation is permitted only one site for missile defense. Currently, 
              the U.S. site is in Grand Forks, North Dakota. Plans to begin pouring 
              concrete for the new site at Fort Greely clearly violate the accord. 
              Stevens, Alaska's senior senator, dismissed concern that these early 
              Star Wars projects might breach the treaty, saying, "Construction 
              of the Shemya radar in and of itself is not a violation of the ABM 
              treaty until it is integrated into a defense system." </p>
            <p>Why Alaska? It's not that all Alaskans welcome the Pentagon. In 
              fact, an organized campaign defeated Edward Teller's nightmarish 
              Project Chariot scenario. And in 1983, Alaskans approved the nuclear 
              freeze initiative by an overwhelming vote. But in a state this large 
              and sparsely populated it's relatively easy for big money to overwhelm 
              citizen opposition, especially when those billions are backed by 
              the lobbying might of the military, the nuclear labs and their contractors. 
            </p>
            <p>At present estimates, the Star Wars program will unleash a $60 
              billion spending spree. In Republican Sens. Frank Murkowski and 
              Stevens, Alaska sports two pitiless hoarders of Pentagon pork. Even 
              Alaska's Clintonesque governor, Democrat Tony Knowles, has gotten 
              into the act, investing a chunk of state money with lobbyists to 
              help steer as much of the Star Wars business to Alaska as possible.</p>
            <p> It will surprise no one who is familiar with the symbiotic relationship 
              between Stevens and the arms makers that the treasurer of his Northern 
              Lights Leadership PAC, Richard Ladd, is also president of Robinson 
              International, a top D.C. lobby shop that specializes in representing 
              defense contractors. In the past two election cycles, the Northern 
              Lights PAC has raked in more than $300,000, largely from corporate 
              executives, many with ties to defense firms. The PAC recycled all 
              that money back into Republican campaigns. In return, the defense 
              companies, led by Boeing and Lockheed-Martin, have been very generous 
              to Stevens. From 1995 to 1999, the senator received $255,650 in 
              PAC contributions from missile defense-related firms, second only 
              to Virginia's John Warner, who, as head of the Senate Armed Services 
              Committee, pulled in $330,000. </p>
            <p>Earlier this year, in an interview with the <i>Alaska Journal of 
              Commerce,</i> Stevens boasted about how he almost single-handedly 
              had steered hundreds of millions of dollars in defense contracts 
              to Alaska, even under President Clinton. He predicted that much 
              more federal loot was ready to flow north in the Bush regime. The 
              money comes in, but it doesn't stay long. Most of it ends up in 
              corporate coffers in Alabama, California and Washington State. Even 
              Ladner, the head of the Alaska Aerospace Development Corporation, 
              recently admitted that the year-round jobs at the Kodiak launch 
              site would probably only amount to a few security and maintenance 
              positions. It's the old Cold War routine repeated once again: The 
              money goes south, but the risk and the waste stays up in Alaska.
