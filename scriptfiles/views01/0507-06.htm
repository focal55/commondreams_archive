To be a Democrat these days is to be bewildered.



<P>To be a Democrat, you are compelled to believe that Al Gore won the nation's popular vote last November and, in a true accounting, also won in Florida.

<P>

<P>At the same time, true-believer Democrats also believe that Gore lost in Florida and failed to win the presidency, both because of Ralph Nader.



<P>Thus, the Democrats' belief, summed up, is this: Gore won and it's Nader's fault he lost.

<P>

<P>Or, put another way: George W. Bush failed to win, and it's Nader's fault he's president.

<P>

<P>Perhaps it's just as well we don't have these people running the country.

<P>

<P>It is true, of course, that votes for Nader in Florida and New Hampshire, if cast instead for Gore, would have enabled Gore to win in both states and thus be president (and 40 pounds lighter) today.

<P>

<P>But it's equally true that in four states -- Wisconsin, Oregon, New Mexico and Iowa -- Gore won because Patrick Buchanan siphoned votes away from Bush.

<P>

<P>Have the Republicans complained about Buchanan's candidacy? Nope, there hasn't been a peep out of them, either before or after the election.

<P>

<P>The Democrats, on the other hand, are treating Nader as if he were the Western World's sole distributor of leprosy.

<P>

<P>During the election campaign, some Democrats cited the absence of a Mrs. Nader as proof that Ralph must be gay. When that didn't wash, they vilified him for being rich, even though he's given away more than he's kept of the several millions he's earned in more than 40 years as a lawyer and author.

<P>

<P>When that didn't take, they pilloried him for investing money in a mutual fund that contained some "dirty" investments. The fact that Nader's share of those "dirty" investments was mere pennies did not interest the vitriolic Democrats.

<P>

<P>The Democrats have somehow overlooked a few facts about their greatly adored candidate, Al Gore.

<P>

<P>They've overlooked the fact that he lost (or at best tied) all three debates with Bush. They've overlooked his failure to carry his home state of Tennessee or Bill Clinton's home state of Arkansas. They've overlooked his putrid choice of a running mate, Joe Lieberman, whose sole asset was locking up the Jewish vote that was already locked up. (In a lockbox, Al, in a lockbox.)

<P>

<P>Democrats, eager to attach blame elsewhere, have ignored Gore's refusal to capitalize on his greatest asset, Bill Clinton. Maybe he never noticed in eight years that Clinton is the greatest political campaigner ever born.

<P>

<P>Gore had everything going for him when the campaign began: a strong economy, tax money pouring in, the deficit vanished, the debt going down, the world's strongest bull market, relative peace, virtually no unemployment, the lowest crime rate in decades, welfare rolls slashed, a strong military, the illegitimate birth and abortion rates both way down ... and on and on and on.

<P>

<P>He could have waltzed into the White House with little effort on that record, yet he chose to distance himself from it by distancing himself from Bill Clinton.

<P>

<P>If the Democrats want to be angry at someone for losing in November, they don't have to look any further than the titular head of their party, Al the Absent.

<P>

<P>Now, Ralph Nader has to take some of the blame for the anger the Democrats have heaped upon him. He has made the mistake of saying, and repeating, that there's no difference between the two major parties.

<P>

<P>In essence, Nader is right, but the concept is a little too complicated for most Democrats to understand. Nader should have kept his mouth shut.

<P>

<P>Sure, Al Gore would be less destructive of our environment -- cripes, who wouldn't be? -- but he wouldn't get us national health care. He'd continue to support our insane drug policy, and he'd go along with international trade agreements that exploit workers and befoul the environment. He wouldn't do anything about the ticking time bomb of 2 million Americans growing old in prisons.

<P>

<P>Money runs politics, and it matters little whether you're Bush/Gore in Washington, Wilson/Davis in Sacramento, or Brown/Feinstein in San Francisco. Corruption abounds. Both major parties are awash in it.

<P>

<P>In that sense, there is no difference between the Democrats and Republicans. There are nuances of differences, of course, blue eyes versus brown eyes, but both creatures are essentially the same.

<P>

<P>That's what Nader means: minor differences, major similarities.

<P>

<P>Rather than ostracizing Nader, the Democrats would do well to seek his counsel and advice. The Democrats have lost sight of their roots. They no longer know who they are. They're organized as a group to fight and try to win, but they no longer stand for anything.

<P>

<P>Sure, they pose and posture, just like the Republicans, but being a Democrat no longer has meaning.

<P>

<P>Nader could lead them back to their populist base. To a true liberal, certain things are no-brainers: Workers are protected, everybody enjoys good health care, the air we breathe and the water we drink are more important than corporate profits.

<P>

<P>We take care of one another. We are our brother's keeper. The big dog does not have the right to eat the little dog.

<P>

<P>Nader believes these things, and the Democrats used to. If they want to win elections, they should get a new grip on reality and return to serving the people of America rather than themselves.

<P>

<P>And they should stop blaming others for their own shortcomings.
