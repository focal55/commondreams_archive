Of the many myths that mushroomed from the carnage of the Vietnam War

perhaps none is more specious than the fable about how a bold,

aggressive mainstream media turned America against the war. As the

pundit class sinks into a new quagmire debating former Sen. Bob Kerrey’s

Vietnam mission, it’s a good time to dissect the myth.



<p>Let’s begin with the My Lai massacre of March 1968, where hundreds of

Vietnamese civilians were executed by American soldiers. My Lai would

later be cited as proof of a mainstream press bent on sensationalizing

U.S. atrocities in Vietnam.



<p>The reality was just the opposite. Beginning months after My Lai,

evidence of the massacre was presented to top national news media by

Vietnam veteran Ron Ridenhour and others, but not one outlet would touch

the story. It wasn’t until November 1969, more than a year and a half

after the My Lai slaughter, that the story was finally published by the

small, alternative Dispatch News Service and dogged investigative

reporter Seymour Hersh.



<p>In the middle of the 20-month period of media silence on My Lai, an

inexperienced lieutenant named Kerrey and his team of Navy Seals were

sent into a "free-fire zone" at Thanh Phong under rules of engagement

that had just been loosened. One wonders if the lives of Vietnamese

civilians there or elsewhere could have been spared if mainstream U.S.

journalists had been aggressive about My Lai, instead of burying the

story for so long.



<p>Myths and empty cliches flourish if unexamined. Professor Daniel Hallin

of the University of California at San Diego conducted perhaps the most

thorough study of U.S. media coverage of Vietnam in light of the

standard rhetoric that Vietnam had been the "living room war" -- an

"uncensored war" showing its "true horror."



<p>What Hallin found was a war, especially on TV, that was largely

sanitized, as a result of media coziness with government and military

sources and network TV policies against airing footage that might offend

soldiers’ families. Pictures of U.S. casualties were rare, Vietnamese

civilian victims almost nonexistent.



<p>It wasn’t the mainstream media that turned the public against the war.

Quite the contrary: it was the public -- especially the ever-growing

anti-war movement fortified by Vietnam veterans who spoke out against

the war -- that prodded mainstream media toward more skeptical coverage.



<p>In February 1968, the Boston Globe surveyed the editorial positions of

39 leading U.S. dailies with a combined circulation of 22 million and

found that not one advocated withdrawal from Vietnam. But that was the

position of millions of Americans who’d educated themselves about the

war -- not through the nightly news or Time magazine -- but via

alternative media or attending protests or talking to returning vets.

Campus teach-ins on Vietnam began in 1965.



<p>The Kerrey controversy begs us to reexamine a key fixture of mainstream

media complicity in Vietnam War deception: the body count. We may never

know whether the civilians at Thanh Phong were killed by accident or

intent, but there is no dispute that Kerrey received a Bronze Star for

the assault based on the official lie that his Seals had bravely killed

21 Viet Cong soldiers -- a standard method of padding the official body

count of enemy dead.



<p>Any alert journalist should have known the official count was grossly

inflated, in large part by adding in dead civilians -- yet Walter

Cronkite and the other network anchors dutifully read it straight faced

week after week.



<p>Cronkite is often remembered for his uncharacteristic on-air commentary

in 1968 calling the war a "stalemate" and urging negotiations. But by

1968, a half-million U.S. troops were already in Vietnam. Professor

Hallin’s study found that, with few exceptions, network coverage prior

to 1968 was "strongly supportive" of the war.



<p>As for the country’s turning against the war, Hallin concluded:

"Television was more a follower than a leader of public opinion." And

the mainstream media debate that intensified in 1968 tended to focus

narrowly on the war’s winnability -- not on the war’s morality or its

effect on the Vietnamese population, two million of whom were ultimately

killed.



<p>The media’s relatively minor focus on the war’s impact on the Vietnamese

-- in whose interest the war was allegedly fought -- persists today.

Editors at Newsweek say that when they decided two years ago not to

publish the story of Kerrey and the Thanh Phong massacre, it was largely

because Sen. Kerrey had chosen not to run for President. It may be a

sign of racism, or at least ethnocentrism, that journalists would judge

this not so much a story about multiple Vietnamese casualties as about

the presidential aspirations of a single American.



<p>Though not a veteran, I played a minor role in the Winter Soldier

hearings convened in Detroit in January 1971 by Vietnam vets to try to

communicate directly to the American people the horrors they’d

experienced. In three days of testimony open to the press and public,

dozens of veterans described -- often tearfully --  atrocities against

Vietnamese they’d witnessed or participated in, events similar to and

more grisly than the killings at Thanh Phong.



<p>The national hearings were dramatic and visual, but few major U.S.

media  bothered to cover them. Many of the veterans expressed hostility

toward the media, blaming gung-ho pro-war coverage for deceiving them

into going to Vietnam in the first place.



<p>During particularly gripping testimony, one of the few mainstream camera

crews present turned off its lights and packed up; the crew’s exit

sparked boos and jeers from the vets. That was the moment I became a

media critic.
