AUSTIN, Texas --

	The Democrats in the U.S. Senate have an unusual opportunity coming up in

the next few weeks. One could even call it unique, if unique were not a

forbidden word in newspapers. The Democrats can prove that everybody who voted

for Ralph Nader was right. It's not often that a party gets to do a thing like

that.

<P>

   The McCain-Feingold campaign-finance reform bill hit the Senate floor this

week with Democrats wobbling all over God's little acre.

<P>



Despite the heroic stand of several Republican senators who have come out

in favor of the bill, Democrats will get--and deserve--the blame if the bill

fails.

<P>

   This is one of those rare moments when the political system has the clarity

of High Noon. We like to think of political fights as a morality play of good

versus evil, when in reality they almost never are. Most serious political

fights are over decisions that are 51-49. This one isn't.<P>

   It's about whether there are two political parties or one--the Money Party.

Either the Democrats stand for something or they don't, and if they stand for

letting the current system of legalized bribery continue, then we're better

off voting for Ralph Nader.<P>

   The opportunity here for the D's is clear, particularly since the

Republicans are off to such an incredibly fast sprint-start in proving the

case for McCain-Feingold.<P>

   Gee, what a record. Hard to see how the influence of campaign contributions

on politics could get clearer than the credit-card industry's purchase of a

harsher bankruptcy law, industry's purchase of the repeal of rules to prevent

repetitive stress injuries and High George Dubya's 180 on CO2.<P>

   As Joseph Welch once said to Sen. Joe McCarthy, "Have you no sense of

decency, sir? At long last, have you left no sense of decency?"<P>

   That McCain-Feingold is an imperfect instrument is beyond argument. It's

not as though we are accustomed to flawless legislation from Congress. The

truth is, unless we start by cleaning up the soft money in politics, we'll

never get anything more done.<P>

   One understands the Democratic money people are in full flower against

McCain-Feingold on the grounds that the D's actually have an edge in raising

soft money. Are these, by any chance, the same people who have brought such

distinction to their party via James Riady, a Buddhist temple, tangled

flow-through schemes and their happy acceptance of immense donations from Marc

Rich? Think how much these folks have done to improve the party's standing

with the public. By all means, let's follow their lead.<P>

   President W. Bush, who is so fond of citing the Texas Legislature as a font

of bipartisan wisdom, will be interested to learn that last week the Texas

Senate voted unanimously for the first real campaign-finance reforms in the

state's history. Since Texas is the Wild West of campaign finance--essentially

no rules, absolutely no limits--this is a startling development.<P>

   True, state Sen. Florence Shapiro's bill is not strong gargle, but it does

prevent hidden corporate contributions and forces out-of-state PAC

contributions into the open.<P>

   One of the annual delights of the debate over campaign-finance reform is

the appearance of new friends of the 1st Amendment; they spring up like

dandelions in April. With a few honorable exceptions, those who carry on over

the dire 1st Amendment implications of campaign-finance reform are summer

soldiers and sunshine patriots when it comes to freedom of speech. Their sole

interest is in the peculiar proposition that money is free speech.<P>

   We never hear from them when anything but big political bucks are at stake:

In those nasty, gut-check fights when freedom of speech has to protect ugly

and repellent ideas, these Fairweather Firsters are nowhere to be found. But

their pompous and condescending lectures on freedom of speech are a treat for

connoisseurs of hypocrisy.<P>

   Please believe that all citizens have a role in this fight: Wobbling

Democrats and heroic Republicans need to hear a steady drumbeat of support

from the public. From C-SPAN junkies to Americans so cynical they haven't

bothered to vote for years, this fight is your fight. Speak up or forever hold

your peace.
