            IF THE SENATE Judiciary Committee straightens its backbone rather 

            than slap the back of attorney general nominee John Ashcroft, we may 

            get to see why his hallucinations about Bull Run will make him a bull 

            in the china closet of civil rights. 

            <P> 

            <P>Any serious line of questioning should start like this:

            <P> 

            <P>Senator Ashcroft, you praised Southern Partisan magazine for ''defending 

              patriots like Robert E. Lee, Stonewall Jackson, and Jefferson Davis. 

              Traditionalists must do more. I've got to do more. We've all got 

              to stand up and speak in this respect, or else we'll be taught that 

              these people were giving their lives, subscribing their sacred fortunes 

              and their honor to some perverted agenda.'' Let's explore what you 

              meant by that.

            <P> 

            <P>Senator, why are you, in the year 2001, praising Davis, the president 

              of the Confederacy, who personally italicized the portions of the 

              Constitution that preserved slavery? Why do you laud a man who said 

              white superiority over African-Americans was ''stamped from the 

              beginning, marked in decree and prophecy''?

            <P> 

            <P>Why do you love a man whose vice president, Alexander Stephens, 

              said the ''cornerstone'' of the Confederacy ''rests upon the great 

              truth that the Negro is not equal to the white man; that slavery, 

              subordination, to the superior race, is his natural and moral condition''?

            <P> 

            <P>Why do you complain about Davis being maligned by historians when 

              Davis tried to rewrite history? He said on the floor of the US Senate 

              in 1860 that ''Negroes formed but a small part of people of the 

              southern states.''

            <P> 

            <P>For the record, in 1860 black people were 55 percent of the population 

              in Davis's home state of Mississippi, 58 percent of South Carolina, 

              and between a third to a half of the people of most of the rest 

              of the slave states. Now, senator, I am reading this sentence again, 

              where you say we've all got to stand up or else we'll be taught 

              that Davis, Lee, and Jackson were subscribing their ''sacred fortunes'' 

              to some ''perverted'' agenda. That sounds a lot like what Davis 

              said in his first Confederate inaugural address when he said the 

              North ''would pervert that most sacred of all trusts.''

            <P> 

            <P>Senator, since we know that that sacred trust was slavery, what 

              is it that you are trying to say? Does that mean you will not investigate 

              charges of black voter fraud in Florida?

            <P> 

            <P>Senator, let's move on to Lee. You say today's history books ''make 

              no mention of Lee's military genius!'' Why is that so important 

              to you when the same Lee called Mexicans ''idle worthless and vicious''? 

              Why do you praise a man who said as he exterminated Indians: ''The 

              whole race is extremely uninteresting ... they are not worth it.'' 

              Where can we find Lee's genius in saying that killing Indians was 

              ''the only corrective they understand and the only way in which 

              they can be taught to keep within their own limits''?

            <P> 

            <P>Why is Lee so good when he justified the ripping of black people 

              out of Africa to enslave them by saying, ''The blacks are immeasurably 

              better off here than in Africa, morally, socially, and physically. 

              The painful discipline they are undergoing is necessary for their 

              instruction as a race''?

            <P> 

            <P>Why does Lee need to be revered when his troops, like other Confederate 

              divisions, hated free black people so much that they sometimes massacred 

              defeated black Union soldiers even though they had thrown down their 

              arms in surrender?

            <P> 

            <P>Senator, may I read you a passage from the new book, ''The Making 

              of Robert E. Lee,'' by Michael Fellman? A Confederate major wrote 

              in 1864 after one battle, ''such slaughter I have not witnessed 

              upon any battlefield anywhere. Their men were principally Negroes 

              and we shot them down until we got near enough and then run them 

              through with the bayonet ... We was not very particular whether 

              we captured or killed them, the only thing we did not like to be 

              pestered burying the heathens.''

            <P> 

            <P>Senator, why do you praise Lee when, after the Civil War, he actively 

              resisted Reconstruction? Lee said white people are ''inflexibly 

              opposed to any system of laws that would place the political power 

              of the country in the hands of the Negro race.'' He said black people 

              lacked the ''intelligence ... necessary to make them safe repositories 

              of political power.''

            <P> 

            <P>Senator, thank you, but in light of your reverence for such men, 

              we'll be asking President-elect Bush to appoint a less antebellum 

              attorney general. As you leave, stop by the front desk. The clerk 

              will arrange for you to participate in a Civil War reenactment in 

              the slave state of your choice. Please send us a photo of your experience. 

              We would love to see who you dressed up as. We're betting against 

              Frederick Douglass.
