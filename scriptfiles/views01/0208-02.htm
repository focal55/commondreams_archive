THE US TAX CODE, forged from periodic congressional compromises and riddled with special interest loopholes, has nonetheless been an effective tool for raising revenue and fostering economic growth. Contrary to what President Bush has been saying all week, it is not good policy to lower all the income tax rates that are the bedrock of the taxation system.



<P>

<P>''It's tax relief for everybody who pays taxes,'' Bush said of his plan. ''That's what the times and basic fairness demand.'' The system, for all the revisions over the years, continues to be based on the premise that those who earn the most ought to pay the most. This principle ought to be maintained.

<P>

<P>Rates can go too high, and no one is considering a return to the bad old days of a 90 percent top bracket. The highest rate is now 39.6 percent, thanks to the tax law proposed in 1993 by President Clinton and denounced by the Republicans as the precursor to a recession. The Clinton tax schedule has served the nation well during the boom of the 1990s, the longest period of prosperity in US history.

<P>

<P>Income taxes gathered during this time brought in enough revenue to end the era of budget deficits. Yet the rates did not discourage the rich from increasing their earnings. According to Citizens for Tax Justice, income of the top one percent of taxpayers rose 40.9 percent during the 1990s, to an average of $915,254. The income of the lowest 40 percent increased less than 4 percent.

<P>

<P>Bush would cut the top rate to 33 percent and lower all the other rates as well, so that all taxpayers can get a cut of the huge surpluses that are predicted over the next decade. But the rich would benefit far more than the less affluent families whom Bush has been appearing with this week.

<P>The rich have aleady benefited from the decision of Congress in 1997 to cut the capital gains tax from 28 to 20 percent, significantly below the income tax rate. This year, Congress ought to target tax benefits to those further down the ladder. It would be sound policy to reduce the number of revenue draining loopholes as well.

<P>The Democrats are starting to unveil their own tax cut plans, which so far consist  of targeted tax breaks left over from Al Gore's campaign.They ought to go further and devise a tax credit to compensate for the impact of the Social Security payroll tax, which affects low-income people far more than the income tax.

<P>

<P>''Life is unfair,'' President Kennedy once said.  He was referring to the fate of servicemen in war, but he could as aptly have been describing the US economy, where birth or the advantages of a good education often lead to great wealth. The next tax cut ought to mitigate this reality, not worsen it.

<P>
