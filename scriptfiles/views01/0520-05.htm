Before the recent American presidential election, Monsanto advised its shareholders that, regardless of which candidate won, the company would have a friend in the White House. The same assurances could be made by big business in this country in the run-up to a farce of an election on 7 June. For whichever party you vote for will make little difference. The reason, simply, is that none of the main parties offers even a hint of choice on the biggest issues we face today. 

<P>In 1944, at a UN conference in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire, the World Bank, International Monetary Fund and a global free-trade agenda were launched, according to the then United States Treasury Secretary, to stimulate 'the creation of a dynamic world economy'. A prime purpose was to ensure American corporations increased access to new markets and raw materials.  

<P>What happened to that New World Order? The Bank's reputation lies in ruins following the admission that more than half its projects have failed and the Structural Adjustment Programs imposed on the developing world have caused more poverty than they have prevented. But the project has continued.  

<P>Formally set up only six years ago, the World Trade Organization is the most dramatic extension of the corporate agenda, and was described by the Economist magazine as an 'embryo world government', and by the former director-general of the WTO as 'a constitution for a single global economy'. Its purpose is to engineer the elimination of all barriers to trade. In effect, it is becoming illegal for governments to hinder the profits of big business. WTO casualties already make impressive reading, and include the US Clean Air Act and Japanese pesticide standards for food, among many others. An 'embryo world govern ment' - and yet no one voted for it.  

<P>Globalization has led to radical changes in the way we live. The goals that were set 50 years ago remain unchanged and, in fact, have been achieved many times over. Since Bretton Woods, for instance, the world has seen a 12-fold increase in global trade and a five-fold increase in economic growth. But during that same period, the world has deteriorated. Nearly three billion people today survive on less than $2 (&#163;1.40) a day, per capita incomes are falling in 80 countries, and life expectancy has declined in 33 countries since 1990. Meanwhile, the global environment lies close to ruins.  

<P>Yet not one of our leaders has shown the courage to question these trends. The biggest issue today is the corporate takeover of our democracy. The nation state itself has been outgrown by corporations. Those corporations are setting the agenda and, not surprisingly, that agenda suits them best. What we're seeing today is massive deregulation at the global level that will further empower those corporations, and massive reregulation at the local level. While big business gain subsidies and political access, small businesses drown in red tape and individuals now risk being classified as terrorists for complaining about it. Economic globalization is about homogenizing differences in the worlds' markets, cultures, tastes and traditions. It's about giving big business access to a global market.  

<P>More than half the world's largest 100 economies are corporations. They have no loyalties to place or citizens. And they are mobile. More than a third of all foreign investment is accounted for by just 100 corporations, and as long as leaders believe that a nation's success lies in its ability to attract foreign investors, we will continue to see a lowering of national standards, the sacrifice of local businesses and an invasion by untested technologies.  

<P>Tony Blair has said that globalization is irreversible and irresistible'. He is wrong. There is an alternative. Instead of subsidizing the biggest businesses, instead of shaping the global infrastructure to accommodate our trade obsession, instead of externalizing the inefficiencies of the global economy - waste, pollution, social breakdown, illness - so that the biggest operators appear more efficient, we can reverse these trends. We can demand support for our local producers, restrictions on dangerous imports, protection for our local economies. Yes, we may lose the edge on the competition, but we will be better off.  

<P>These are issues which merit discussion. Yet nowhere is such debate to be found. The Liberal Democrats are good at appearing to occupy the middle ground with a green agenda, but their policy commitments are nothing more than gestures. For they are utterly devoted to globalization and to a multinational corporate agenda. The Conservatives are a confusing lot. They first denied climate change was a serious issue and then suggested strengthening the nuclear industry as a solution to it. They oppose the European Union, but support joining North American Free Trade Agreement, despite its obvious failure.  

<P>But it is Mr Blair who takes the biscuit. He supports increased fuel tax to 'combat climate change', yet allocates minuscule amounts of the resulting surplus to fossil-fuel alternatives, and endorses EU plans to spend 400bn euros on the world's biggest ever road-building scheme. He has acknowledged the seriousness of human-induced climate change, yet promised to invest 10 times less into renewable energies than was spent on the Millennium Dome.  

<P>We live in an era of cartoon politics, where Phoenix the calf is saved while millions burn, where giant decisions are delegated to unelected and invisible corporate trade experts. A recent NOP poll suggests nearly a third of the electorate will boycott the election in June, the highest number since 1918. I may join them. The cake each party will present to the people on 7 June will carry the same ingredients. How they choose to slice it is irrelevant, for it will poison us all in due course.
