It was a remarkable comment that passed without notice. After 

interviewing the new White House chief of staff, a network anchor bade him 

farewell. "All right, Andy Card," said CNN's Judy Woodruff, "we look 

forward to working with you, to covering your administration."



         <p>If major news outlets were committed to independent journalism, 

Woodruff's statement on national television Jan.19 would have caused quite 

a media stir -- as a sign of undue coziness with power brokers in 

Washington. But it was far from conspicuous.



         <p>Woodruff's remark was matter-of-fact. Warm collaboration is 

routine. Many reporters work closely with each new crew of top government 

officials.



        <p> Leading journalists and spinners in high places are accustomed to 

mutual reliance. That's good for professional advancement. But the public's 

right to know is another matter.



         <p>"The first fact of American journalism is its overwhelming 

dependence on sources, mostly official, usually powerful," Walter Karp 

pointed out in Harper's Magazine a dozen years ago. Since then, the problem 

has grown even more acute. A multitude of journalists advance their careers 

by (in Woodruff's words) "working with" movers and shakers in government.



        <p>Reporters with outsized reputations for investigative vigor -- Bob 

Woodward, for example -- may be the most compromised. Behind the scenes, 

the tacitly understood tradeoffs amount to quid pro quos. Officials 

dispense leaks to reporters with track records of proven willingness to 

stay within bounds.



         <p>"It is a bitter irony of source journalism," Karp observed, "that 

the most esteemed journalists are precisely the most servile. For it is by 

making themselves useful to the powerful that they gain access to the 

'best' sources."



         <p>While some fine journalism, assertive and carefully researched, 

gets into print and onto airwaves every day, the islands of such reporting 

are drowned in oceans of glorified leaks and institutional handouts. But 

democracy is only served when journalists keep searching for information 

that officials hide.



         <p>On the surface, concerns about scant separation of press and state 

might seem to be misplaced. After all, don't we see network correspondents 

firing tough questions at politicians? Isn't the press filled with 

criticism of policymakers?



         <p>Well, kind of. We're encouraged to confuse partisan wrangles with 

ample debate, or -- in the case of certain TV shows -- high decibels with 

wide diversity. To a great extent, mainstream media outlets provide big 

megaphones for those who already have plenty of clout. That suits wealthy 

owners and large advertisers. But what about democratic discourse?



         <p>In general, news coverage of political issues is about as varied 

as the array of views propounded by the hierarchies of the Democratic and 

Republican parties. When there's bipartisan agreement on particular topics 

-- such as the wisdom of keeping 2 million Americans behind bars or the 

value of corporate globalization -- the media space for debate tends to be 

very limited. Consensus among major-party leaders has a way of 

circumscribing the mass-media arena.



         <p>With huge conglomerates more enmeshed in media ownership and 

advertising than ever, news operations are under heightened pressure to 

promote corporate outlooks, dovetailing with rightward trends in 

governance. It's true that business has always dominated government 

policymaking. But in recent times, mitigating interests -- often known in 

mediaspeak as "special interests" -- have been increasingly expunged from 

serious consideration.



         <p>"What is new about the situation today is that a seemingly 

irreversible mutation in the American system has occurred," syndicated 

columnist William Pfaff wrote in mid-January. "At some point, quantitative 

change does become qualitative change. The point when that change took 

place was probably 1976, when the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that money spent 

in support of a political candidate is a form of constitutionally protected 

free speech. Moneyed interests now finance not only the winners of national 

elections but also most of the losers."



        <p> Pfaff's column appears most prominently in the International 

Herald Tribune. Based in Paris, he has a clear-eyed view of big money's 

leverage over U.S. politics: "This is part of the enlarging domination of 

American life by business corporations and their values, which are those of 

material aggrandizement, a phenomenon accompanied and promoted by the 

circuses and gladiatorial contests provided by the most important U.S. 

industry of all, entertainment, which now showcases elections and even wars 

as entertainments."



         <p>We need wide-ranging news media. And that's unlikely as long as 

most "journalism" resembles stenography for the powerful -- and very few 

eyebrows get raised when a network anchor tells a key official of an 

incoming administration that "we look forward to working with you."
