<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->As a World War II veteran who served in the South Pacific, I know the 

horror of war first-hand. Our great victory in that "good" war should not 

be twisted into the inspiration for massive military action now. President 

Bush, Congress and world leaders must root out terrorists everywhere, but 

not wipe out ordinary people anywhere.



<p>While I am outraged by the terrorist attacks, I ask the US government not 

to compound the tragedy.  As a proud US citizen and as a US Army war 

veteran, I must speak up and tell our nation's leaders: "Don't perpetuate 

the cycle of violence." Bringing terrorists to justice must not become to 

excuse to wage a wholesale war against Islamic nations and Muslim people 

around the world (including here at home) -- the vast majority of whom are

as innocent as everyone murdered at the World Trade Center. As a Jew, I am 

all too familiar with the world's willingness to demonize and try to 

destroy whole groups of people on the basis of race, religion, ethnicity or 

nationality. There already has been a grotesque slaughter of the innocents 

around the world and across the centuries. It is time for it to stop.



<p>That's where America's role and response become most important. September 

11th marks the end of one era in American history. As the world's only 

superpower, the ball is largely in our court. Will we respond to the causes 

of terrorism, as well as to its awful effects? How can President Bush even 

hope to win a war against an elusive enemy that, like a cancer, has spread 

its tentacles everywhere around the world and across America? Where will 

Congress send our soldiers, our battleships and our war planes -- in other 

words, where can we unleash our unquestioned military might without doing 

far more harm than good? How should America deal with these dilemmas?



<p>History may provide an answer. Our first Republican President, Abraham 

Lincoln, warned that our nation could not endure half slave and half free. 

So too, our WORLD cannot endure divided against itself into the "haves" and 

the "have nots."  The only war worthy of America's treasure, talent, time 

and lives is a world-wide war against human suffering. We must "turn our 

swords into plowshares and study war no more." The peace-seeking, loving, 

merciful tenets espoused by ALL the world's sacred texts and holy leaders 

have been prostituted, misused or simply forgotten throughout history by 

religious zealots throughout the world. A "Jihad" is just a "Crusade" 

dressed up in different clothing. And, acts of violence still reap only the 

whirlwind . . . never peace nor justice.



<p>Take the advice of this old soldier before I, too, fade away. Lashing out 

in anger doesn't take one-half the guts of quelling the spirit of vengeance 

within ourselves. Fighting wars of any kind doesn't take one-tenth the 

intelligence of (at long last) creating a harmonious, prosperous world.   

America's challenge as the world's only remaining superpower is to use that 

power to sow the seeds of peace, forgiveness and fairness for all our 

brothers and sisters in the human family. Terrorism cannot take root, or 

flourish, among people who are liberated from hunger, torture, ignorance, 

poverty, tyranny and all the other true evils in our world.



<p>Make war on war itself.
