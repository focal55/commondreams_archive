<i>"The first casualty, when war comes, is truth."

</i>Senator Hiram Johnson, World War I



<p><i>"We are learning to do what the British used to do so well- Lie." 

</i>U.S. Intelligence Officer, November 2001



<p>The papers are full of news of Johnny "Mike" Spann from Alabama. The

Central Intelligence Agency officer, who served in the Directorate of

Operations, is being described as a hero and a patriot. He is also being

described as "the first American combat death" in Afghanistan. He was

killed during fighting at the Qala-I-Jhangi mud fort near

Mazar-I-Sharif. Five American soldiers were seriously wounded in the

same raid, when an U.S. bomb landed too close to them. Until Thursday,

the CIA and Pentagon were denying reports that Spann had died. Now that

they admit it, they say he is the first.



<p>According to a November 17th UPI article this is not true. Reporter

Richard Sale quotes an unnamed U.S. administration official as saying

that between 25 and 40 U.S. Special Forces have been killed so far,

mostly in fighting in southern Afghanistan, around Kandahar. While

Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld said no Americans were killed in

these operations, a State Department official retorted "that's crazy." 



<p>Besides Mike Spann, the Pentagon acknowledges four other American

deaths in incidents related to the war on terrorism, but not in

Afghanistan. Two soldiers were killed on October 20th when their

helicopter crashed in Pakistan. Two others died in accidents, one,

Bryant Davis, stationed on the USS Kitty Hawk fell overboard on November

7th and was lost.



<p>John Pike, president of Washington-based GlobalSecurity. Org, referred

to a press conference last month where Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld

was quizzed about the Taliban displaying a wheel of a helicopter, torn

off in an accident, but which the Taliban claimed was shot down.

According to Pike, at the end of his explanation, Rumsfeld looked at the

reporters and stated the equivalent of: "This is the last time I'm

telling you the truth." 



<p>At a press conference on Monday, November 26th, President Bush warned,

"Americans must be prepared for the loss of life," in Afghanistan.

Prepared or not, here they come. A Taliban spokesman claimed in early

November that ninety-five American soldiers have been killed in

Afghanistan. The Pentagon claims five. Somewhere between those two

figures lies the truth. Americans can't prepare for loss of life without

the truth about who, where, when and why. Only then can we judge if this

loss of life is worth it. And maybe that is why they aren't telling us

the truth. 



<p>The truth in war is as necessary as it is elusive. The support from 95%

of Americans hinges on the war's antiseptic perfection, its remoteness

and incomprehensibility. When the war begins to come home-- when the

stories of missed targets, friendly fire incidents, the brutality and

lawlessness of our Northern Alliance allies and foot soldiers are

told-that overwhelming support will falter and crumbled.
