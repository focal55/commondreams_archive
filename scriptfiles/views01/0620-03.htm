THERE WAS a time when many Northwesterners thought we could watch 

California's energy crisis from a safe distance.

<P>We have since learned that a major energy crisis does not stop at the 

Golden State's borders but, instead, rolls over the Northwest like a tidal 

wave, wreaking havoc with our economy and overwhelming our carefully crafted 

energy policies.

<P>As one Northwest utility official put it, "We learned that everyone else is 

the tail. California is the dog."

<P>To understand why the Northwest is now facing its own energy crisis and how 

the energy problems in the Northwest and California each affect each other, 

one must understand how the Northwest gets its power.

<P>In the Northwest, falling water is our primary fuel. Depending on the 

available snowpack, hydroelectricity produced at more than 200 dams in the 

Columbia River basin generates between 60 and 75 percent of the region's 

electricity. About two-thirds of this hydropower comes from 29 dams owned and 

operated by the two federal agencies, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the 

Bureau of Reclamation.

<P>By taking advantage of the region's geography and climate, the Columbia's 

hydroelectric dams have produced some of the least expensive electricity in 

the nation, power that has been the economic backbone of the region.

<P>However, the Columbia's hydrosystem also has two curses.

<P>One is that water conditions can vary greatly, and right now the Northwest 

and California are in the middle of an extreme drought. The second is the 

dams' negative impact on salmon. These dams operate under a federal salmon 

recovery plan established under the Endangered Species Act that calls for more 

water to be sent over spillways to help push the salmon downstream instead of 

through the dams' power-generating turbines.

<P>That power is sold at cost and transmitted to Northwest consumer-owned 

utilities by yet another federal agency called the Bonneville Power 

Administration. These "cost-based" rates cover the expense of repaying the U.S.

<P>Treasury for the cost of developing these hydropower projects, moving the 

power over massive transmission lines, and supporting efforts to restore the 

dwindling salmon runs.

<P>Under federal law, Northwest consumers get preferred access to the 

relatively low-cost power. Any surplus power can be sold, most often to 

California's municipal and investor-owned utilities.

<P>This Northwest "regional preference" to federal power was part of the deal 

that led to the construction of the massive transmission lines, called "the 

intertie," which first connected the Northwest with California and the 

Southwest in the late 1960s.

<P>For decades, the intertie worked almost flawlessly and to everyone's 

benefit.

<P>During the summer, when air conditioners caused California's power use to 

peak, many California utilities would supplement their needs by turning to the 

Northwest. In the winter, when Northwest electric furnaces are turned on for 

space heating, California utilities would return the favor and ship their 

surplus power north.

<P>Recently, the BPA has had to purchase large blocs of power on the wholesale 

market to meet its contractual obligations to its Northwest customers.

<P>The same exorbitant wholesale prices that began to plague California last 

year have also affected the Northwest, meaning that the BPA has been running 

out of money, and is now in danger of defaulting on its debt obligations to 

the Treasury.

<P>California's deregulation plan has affected energy relations between the 

two regions in other ways. For example, the BPA has historically sold surplus 

power to California for relatively low prices. However, the state's 

deregulation law made it almost impossible for California utilities to enter 

into favorable long-term contracts.

<P>Instead, power had to be purchased at the much higher "market clearing 

price" on the short-term spot market.

<P>The BPA has taken extraordinary steps to help California keep the lights on.

<P>At times, the agency even declared energy emergencies, which allowed it to 

temporarily override salmon protections and use the water to generate power 

for California rather than sweep salmon over the dams. California officials 

have praised the BPA for its cooperation, but Northwest environmentalists and 

tribal leaders complain that the BPA has been helping California address its 

energy crisis by selling salmon down the river.

<P>The Northwest will be helped by FERC's decision yesterday to extend limited 

temporary price restrictions it had imposed in California in the spring to 

other Western states during severe shortages. The order should also be good 

for California. Without consistent price restrictions throughout the West, 

power marketers would simply skip California during an emergency and sell at 

higher prices elsewhere.

<P>But not everyone is happy with the decision. Many critics say the rates are 

still too high, and some critics said in s published report that the "order 

rewards inefficiency by pegging price ceilings to the costliest California gas 

plants."

<P>The half-hearted response from FERC, along with continuing supply shortages 

and other problems make it likely that California will continue to face 

rolling blackouts and high utility bills -- even though they may not be as 

high as we once feared.

<P>The Northwest may follow suit next winter.

<P>Some in our region fear that some desperate California political leaders 

might try to wrest control of the BPA and a large portion of the Columbia 

Basin's hydropower. The 6,600 megawatts of hydropower from the Columbia's 

federal dams would only offer a few drops in the bucket for California's 

massive 50,000-megawatt system, but its loss would devastate the Northwest 

economy.

<P>The four Northwest governors (of Washington, Oregon, Idaho and Montana) and 

more than 40 state legislators met in February and agreed to explore ways to 

ensure that the Northwest does not lose its regional preference to the 

Columbia's hydropower.

<P>Northwest governors have had some productive meetings with Gov. Gray Davis 

and his staff this year regarding power sharing, and there are encouraging 

signs that trust is growing at this and other levels.

<P>Just last week, officials from the BPA, California's Department of Water 

Resources, and the California ISO agreed on a plan that outlines when and how 

the BPA may be able to help California during the expected summer shortages.

<P>We will soon find out whether our two regions will succeed in collaborating 

with or cannibalizing each other as we enter the next phase of the West Coast 

energy crisis.

<P>Ultimately, California's experience with energy deregulation makes the case 

for a strong and supportive federal role in the energy markets. It also 

reinforces the view that electricity should be treated as an essential service 

and be sold at cost by utilities that are owned and controlled by the public, 

rather than as a commodity and sold at the highest price.

<P>In fact, something like a California power authority that places California 

in charge of its own destiny makes more sense to me all the time.
