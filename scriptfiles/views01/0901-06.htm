There are things that happen in life that cast a sudden and unwelcome spotlight on a part of us we'd rather not see, or perhaps didn't even know was there. It happens to most people and to societies.
<p>Kitty Genovese, a young New York woman who was stabbed to death while dozens of people watched from their apartment windows but did nothing to help, was a wake-up call for Americans of the 1960s. What they woke up to was an America undergoing a change that shocked the more naïve sensibilities of that time. But, of course, they thought, that's just New York City. It can't happen here, or in Boise, or Pittsburgh, or Dubuque.</p>
<p>But we know better, don't we?</p>
<p>I've always thought of Genovese's death as a kind of marker. A big, red flag that reads "Americans estrangement from each other begins here." American society was imperfect in many ways before that, but the sense of community and an assumption of friendliness was strong. </p>
<p>On his first visit to our country in 1913, the great Swiss psychologist Carl Jung was overcome by the openess and sense of brotherhood he encountered. But in a letter to his wife, he made a prescient observation. While praising American technical ingenuity and the easy lifestyle it was beginning to engender, Jung mused that our absorption with technology would backfire on us one distant day in the future.</p>
<p>We, the busy denizens of the 21st century, know that we are living in that day. But it would have been far easier for Jung to have diagnosed its effects on us than it is for us to do so with any real clarity. Even our finest minds, our best contemporary social observers, are saturated by the noise and assumptions of the culture we all live in. As with Kitty Genovese, it takes one of those signal, shocking events to cut away the mask of the culture.</p>
<p>For me, as a native Seattleite, an American and, above all, a human being, Tuesday's suicde attempt by the young woman on the Ship Canal Bridge is such an event. It's Seattle's Kitty Genovese.</p>
<p>Mayor Paul Schell's assertion that the people who jeered at the woman to jump were probably all "passing through the city" and not actually from here was good for a laugh. I think we all know that's not true. </p>
<p>And what does it matter, anyway? Wherever they reside is immaterial: The reaction of dozens of callers to local radio talk shows was equally venomous and judgmental about an obviously desperate young woman. A couple of our "compassionate conservative" radio hosts were even scarier.</p>
<p>This is our city, folks, and these are our neighbors. We can't point fingers at New York any longer. This is Seattle, technology capital of the world, home to the Mariners and Microsoft and WTO and an incident of unabashed cruelty.</p>
<p>A mirror has been held up to our community. Let's look in it.</p>
