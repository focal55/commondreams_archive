STOCKHOLM - When the Swedish say they value children, they mean it. 

<p>

All those moms pushing prams on the streets of this beautiful city have not traded career for baby. They are taking advantage of the year of parental leave that is national policy in this country.

<p>

The leave - usually with 80 percent pay and return-to-work guarantee - is only the first part of the child-and-family-centered policy in Sweden. In the 1970s, the country established day care and preschool for all children as part of its welfare state. 

<p>

For the Seattle delegation visiting Stockholm last week, "welfare state" is a very high hurdle. The very words tend to close minds and shut down conversation. 

<p>

Don't expect these business and civic leaders to return with a blueprint for public subsidies for day care and parental leave. But to dismiss child-centered policies and programs as do-able only in Sweden and impossible in America and Seattle is to miss the point. 

<p>

It's important to recognize that Sweden has gone through major reforms in the past decade. A severe economic downturn in the early '90s ended the rule of the liberal Social Democrats and led to numerous government reforms and deregulation. Social Democrats are back in power at the national level, but a coalition of moderates and conservatives holds sway in Stockholm, the nation's political, business and cultural center. 

<p>

Despite major political and economic upheaval, the government's commitment to children is as strong as ever. A recent focus on reforms of the preschool program is "not just for both parents to work, but because early stimulation is important to the child," Sweden's minister of Education and Science told Seattleites last week. 

<p>

His was part of a consistent message here: We are reforming - opening markets, privatizing, deregulating, encouraging entrepreneurs, lowering taxes - but we remain committed to equality and care for children and the elderly.

<p>

Sweden's child care also includes what they call "leisure-time care" before and after school hours until a child is 12 years old. It is not free. Parents pay a fee based on their income. 

<p>

These ideas are not unheard of at home, of course. Seattle's Project Lift-Off is an ambitious program to create a quality, affordable system of day care and out-of-school care for children. The need is well documented. By one estimate, Seattle businesses lose more than $130 million a year due to employee absences, tardiness and distractions caused by unreliable child care. 

<p>

Low wages, lack of training and standards, and high turnover among child-care workers is widespread in the Seattle area. 

<p>

At the very least, this study mission to Stockholm should produce more support for Project Lift-Off and the web of public-private initiatives it promotes. 

<p>

One member of the delegation who paid especially close attention to this issue is Bridgett Chandler, vice president for external relations of Talaris Research Institute. Talaris is a new kind of start-up funded by Bruce and Jolene McCaw. Formed in January, the institute's aim is to advance the knowledge of early brain development in children. It is housed at the former Battelle site near the University of Washington, where it plans to build a new facility to attract the world's leading researchers in brain development. At Talaris, neuroscientists, molecular biologists, psychologists and education researchers will work together. An on-site child-care facility will serve as a laboratory of sorts. 

<p>

"This is not about raising brainier kids," Chandler said, but about understanding how we learn and what makes for the best foundation for learning through life. 

<p>

Exciting work in this field is well under way, including at the UW. The McCaws' goal is to bring the best of the science to Seattle, and to get what they are learning into the hands of parents, caregivers and policy makers. 

<p>

One early lesson from Stockholm is that the best knowledge in the world is of limited use unless it is made widely available throughout society. That is especially true when the subject is children and how they learn. 

<p>

Talaris Institute may give Seattle bragging rights as home to a fine new research center. But unless we find a way, through Project Lift-Off perhaps, to apply knowledge broadly and care for all our children as effectively as they do in Stockholm, we will be the lesser city.
