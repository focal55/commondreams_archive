"You have heard it was said, 'An eye for an eye and a tooth for a

tooth.' But I say to you, do not resist him who is evil, but whoever

slaps you on your right cheek, turn to him also the other...You have

heard that it was said, 'You shall love your neighbor and hate your

enemy.' But I say to you love your enemies, and pray for those who

persecute you."

     <p>It may well be that in the human experience,  more difficult words

have never been uttered.  The practicality of these instructions seem to

defy all logic -- how could one ever imagine circumstances that would

call for such a response?  Perhaps in an ideal, or better yet, in a

perfect world, one could give consideration to these seemingly

impossible teachings. But then in a perfect world how could evil ever

gain a foothold, or disputes that would create enemies even exist?

    <p>No, in these words rest the wisdom of  ages present, the remedy for

the human condition, the power to undo Hiroshima.  In these words we

learn forgiveness -- not surrender, certainly not capitulation, but, as

Dostoyevski put it, the harsh and even dreadful reality which  becomes

the heart of love in action.

     <p>I have had the privilege to stand in the presence of forgiveness in

situations of incalcuable loss and have been awed by its transforming

power.  I have walked beside Amber, Ryan, and Barry Amundson, wife and

brothers of Craig Scott Amundson who was killed at his post in the

Pentagon on that dreadful September morning.  I have shared stories and

laughter with David Potorti whose brother Jim died in the World Trade

Center.  They, along with other families of victims of 9/11, have become

a moral compass to the nation as they issue a clarion call for justice

without revenge, peace without war, an end to perpetual cycles of

violence.

    <p>I have stood with families in hospital wards in Baghdad watching

their children suffer and die for lack of simple medicines and clean

water -- their plea to us being that no other families experience the

horrors, the sorrows, they have known.  I have been witness to farmers

in Iraq whose son and brother was killed by an American cluster bomb

while watching his family's sheep on yet  another clear, blue morning.

They gave our humbled delegation the only photograph they had of young

Omran so we could continue to tell his story to anyone willing to

listen--a story of innocence lost in the collision of empire and

ideology.

     <p>I have read the report by Robert Fisk, reporter and Middle East

expert, as he was being beaten to death by a crowd of Afghani refugees

-- how he understood why they felt the need to lash out at anyone from

the West and the shame he experienced as he escaped to safety.

     <p>This depth of understanding, of compassion, of forgiveness, is not

unique to these exceptional individuals and families.  It is a thread

that runs through us all as children of a common Creator. Some have

experienced it on a personal level with friends and family.  Others have

seen how it can transform social structures and even nations.

    <p> It is a power that is neither sentimental nor without cost --

witness the assassinations of Gandhi, Martin Luther King Jr., Oscar

Romero; the murders of countless human rights workers -- Dorothy Kazel,

Jean Donovan, Ita Ford, Maura Clarke, Jafar Siddaq Hamzah; the

imprisonment's of Aung San Su Kyi, Philip Berrigan, Angie Zelter,

Mubarak Awad.

<p>Forgiveness has been the lifeblood of the movement to free South

Africa from apartheid.  Love of enemies fueled those who led the ouster

of Ferdinand Marcos from the Philippines, the liberation of East Timor,

and the dissolution of communist block countries in the late eighties.

In East Germany hundreds of thousands gathered regularly at the church

of St. Nicholas in Leipzig to reflect on the Sermon on the Mount.

Holding their candles, surrounded by the STASI (East German Secret

Police) people demanded democracy and free elections. After the

government of Erich Honecker had fallen, Horst Sindermann, a member of

the Central Committee of the GDR remarked, "We had planned everything.

We were prepared for everything. But not for candles and prayer."

<p>In the Judeo-Christian tradition, there was a time when evil had so

multiplied that God unleashed the ultimate weapon of mass destruction, a

flood that destroyed virtually everyone in the world.  When that didn't

work and evil reestablished itself,  God chose forgiveness as the

cornerstone for saving us from ourselves.  Even Jesus forgave his

murderers in the midst of his execution  The strength, the wisdom, the

purity, of forgiveness as the precursor to justice seems to have eluded

us for over two thousand years now.

<p>As Christians approach the celebration of the birth of the One

whose counsel often sticks in our throats, we would do well to consider

the words of G. K. Chesterton: "The Christian ideal has not been tried

and found wanting.  It has been found difficult and left untried."  We

believe, help us in our unbelief.  Lord have mercy.
