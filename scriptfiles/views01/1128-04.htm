In the folklore of the business press, a widely held explanation has 

already congealed for the upswing that led optimists to proclaim the emergence 

of a "new economy." The now conventional wisdom flows as follows: together with 

Congress, the Clinton Administration got the ball rolling by balancing the 

federal budget, and moving it towards surplus. This caused long-term interest 

rates to fall, which led to an investment boom&#8212;especially in the high-tech 

sectors&#8212;and stimulated such interest-sensitive purchases as housing.



<p>All that new investment caused productivity to grow by leaps and bounds. 

Since productivity&#8212;the amount of goods or services that an hour of labor can 

produce&#8212;is the basis of economic growth, this raised incomes across the 

spectrum. The virtuous circle was completed by the response of the Federal 

Reserve: because of the surge in productivity, we are told, the Fed didn't have 

to worry about rapid growth leading to accelerating inflation. Thus the Fed was 

able to lower short-term rates, and allow for a record-long expansion, with 

unemployment falling to a 30-year low of 3.9 percent.

</p>



<p>Sounds plausible, doesn't it? And familiar. Now let's look at the 

numbers. Over the course of the business cycle,  real (inflation-adjusted) interest 

rates on mortgages and high-grade corporate bonds fell by only 0.8 percent. This 

certainly doesn't look like enough to stimulate an investment or housing boom, 

and it wasn't. Housing barely increased at all, as a percentage of the economy. 

And if we look at both investment components of GDP (investment plus net 

exports), the investment share actually declined slightly.</P>



<p>Productivity growth did increase, as compared to the business cycle of 

the 80s. But it was still considerably lower than the growth of the 50s and 60s 

business cycles. If we adjust for the increased share of output that was used up 

in more rapid depreciation&#8212;mostly computers and software&#8212;the productivity growth 

of the 90s cycle does not even beat the 70s. And wage growth for a typical 

worker was a paltry 0.5 percent a year.</P>



<p>So much for the "new economy." Still, it was a long expansion, and a 

pleasant memory compared to what we are facing right now. So what was behind it, 

if the official story doesn't hold up to the numbers? Most importantly, there 

was a consumption boom that was driven by an enormous bubble in the stock 

market. Personal savings rates fell to zero as upper-income households&#8212;the ones 

that hold stocks&#8212;saw the value of these assets soar.</P>



<p>The Fed's change in policy allowed the expansion to continue. Prior to 

1995, it would slow the economy when unemployment fell below 6 percent, on the 

theory that this was the best we could do. But this drastically important policy 

change&#8212;even today, we have millions of additional jobs as a result&#8212;could have 

been made at any time. It was not a result of 1990s productivity increases, but 

rather the Fed's belated realization that its prior theory was wrong.</P>



<p>Understanding the 1990s expansion, and its collapse, is vitally important 

to getting us out of the current recession. The evaporation of $8 trillion in 

stock market wealth translates into more than $300 billion in reduced 

consumption. This means we need a stimulus package  more than twice as large as the one 

that Senate Democrats are 

proposing (the House Republican plan contained hardly any stimulus at all, 

consisting mostly of tax breaks for corporations and high-income 

households).</P>



<p>Diehard policymakers and economists&#8212;including many Democrats&#8212;still cling 

to the notion that fiscal conservatism brought us prosperity. They ache to 

resume paying off the entire national debt at the earliest opportunity. Many 

others welcome the re-inflation of the stock market bubble&#8212;which still exists, 

and has lately been growing.</P>



<p>And 

while the Fed has been doing the right thing by lowering interest rates since 

the slowdown began, it could still revert to its old ways before the recovery is 

on track. This is especially true if our overvalued dollar&#8212;another largely 

unnoticed bubble from the 1990s expansion&#8212;were to drop sharply, raising the 

price of imports.</P>



<p>

The new economy may be dead, but the mythology that created it survives. Let's hope 

that it doesn't cause us any further trouble.</P>
