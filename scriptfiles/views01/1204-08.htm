WASHINGTON -- There were unconfirmed reports yesterday that the United

States is not the center of the world.



<p>The White House had no immediate comment on the reports, which set off

a firestorm of controversy in the nation's capital.



<p>Speaking on background, a high-ranking official at the State Department

discounted the possibility that the reports would turn out to be true. "If

that were the case," he said, "don't you think we would have known about it

a long time ago?"



<p>On Capitol Hill, leaders of both parties were quick to rebut the

assertion. "That certain news organizations would run with such a poorly

sourced and obviously slanted story tells us that the liberal media are

still up to their old tricks, despite the current crisis," a GOP lawmaker

fumed. A prominent Democrat, also speaking on condition of anonymity, said

that classified briefings to congressional intelligence panels had disproved

such claims long ago.



<p>Scholars at leading think tanks were more restrained, and some said

there was a certain amount of literal truth to the essence of the reports.

But they pointed out that while it included factual accuracy in a narrow

sense, the assertion was out of context and had the potential to damage

national unity at a time when the United States could ill afford such a

disruption.



<p>The claim evidently originated with a piece by a Lebanese journalist

that appeared several days ago in a Beirut magazine. It was then picked up

by a pair of left-leaning daily newspapers in London. From there, the story

quickly made its way across the Atlantic via the Internet.



<p>"It just goes to show how much we need seasoned, professional

gatekeepers to separate the journalistic wheat from the chaff before it

gains wide attention," remarked the managing editor of one news program at a

major U.S. television network. "This is the kind of stuff you see on

ideologically driven websites, but that hardly means it belongs on the

evening news." A newsmagazine editor agreed, calling the reports "the worst

kind of geographical correctness."



<p>None of the major cable networks devoted much air time to reporting the

story. At one outlet, a news executive's memo told staffers that any

reference to the controversy should include mention of the fact that the

United States continues to lead the globe in scientific discoveries. At a

more conservative network, anchors and correspondents reminded viewers that

English is widely acknowledged to be the international language -- and more

people speak English in the U.S. than in any other nation.



<p>While government officials voiced acute skepticism about the notion

that the United States is not the center of the world, they declined to

speak for attribution. "If lightning strikes and it turns out this report

has real substance to it," explained one policymaker at the State

Department, "we could look very bad, at least in the short run. Until it can

be clearly refuted, no one wants to take the chance of leading with their

chin and ending up with a hefty serving of Egg McMuffin on their face."



<p>An informal survey of intellectuals with ties to influential magazines

of political opinion, running the gamut from The Weekly Standard to The New

Republic, indicated that the report was likely to gain little currency in

Washington's elite media forums.



<p>"The problem with this kind of shoddy impersonation of reporting is

that it's hard to knock down because there are grains of truth," one editor

commented. "Sure, who doesn't know that our country includes only small

percentages of the planet's land mass and population? But to draw an

inference from those isolated facts that somehow the United States of

America is not central to the world and its future -- well, that carries

postmodernism to a nonsensical extreme."



<p>Another well-known American journalist speculated that the controversy

will soon pass: "Moral relativism remains a pernicious force in our society,

but overall it holds less appeal than ever, even on American campuses. It's

not just that we're the only superpower -- we happen to also be the light

onto the nations and the key to the world's fate. People who can't accept

that reality are not going to have much credibility."
