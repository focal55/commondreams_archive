The spirit of Cesar Chavez lives on in the struggle for union rights and justice in the fields of California.  Along with Dolores Huerta, Philip Vera Cruz, and others, César created the United Farm Workers (UFW) the first successful union of farm workers in  U.S. history.  There had been more than ten prior attempts to build a farm workers union. 

<p>The United Cannery and Packinghouse Workers (UCAPAWA) organized  in the 1930's, the National Farm Workers Union (NFW)  led by Ernesto Galarza  tried to organize Farm workers in  the 40's and 50's.  In 1959, the AFL-CIO tried to organize again with  the Agricultural Workers Organizing Committee  (AWOC).  AWOC had several weaknesses, including a top down leadership selected  by AFL-CIO leaders, not  by farm workers, and a strategy of  working  cooperatively with labor contractors. AWOC continued the prior efforts  of Ernesto Galarza  and the NFW in struggling against "braceros" or guest workers, contract workers  imported from Mexico, from breaking strikes.  A renewed "guest worker" bill is presently before Congress.

<p>Each of the prior attempts to organize farm worker unions were destroyed by racism and corporate power. Chávez chose to build a union that incorporated the strategies of social movements and allied itself  with the churches, students,  and organized labor.  The successful creation of the UFW changed the nature of labor organizing  in the Southwest  and contributed significantly to the birth of Latino politics in the U.S. 

<p>Today, under the leadership of UFW president Arturo Rodriguez, over 28,000 farm workers enjoy benefits on the job. They are incorporated into California's educational, health and civic communities.  The UFW has shown the AFL-CIO  that immigrants can  and must be organized. 

<p>César Chavez, Dolores Huerta,  Philip Vera Cruz, and others deliberately created a multiracial organization, Mexican,  Mexican American, Filipino, African-American, Dominican, Puerto Rican and Arab workers, among others, have been part of the UFW.  This cross racial organizing  was necessary in order to combat the  prior divisions and exploitations of workers based upon race and language. Dividing the workers on racial and language lines always left the corporations the winners.

<p>In the 60's Chávez became the pre-eminent civil rights leader for the Mexican and Chicano workers, helping with local union struggles throughout the nation.  He worked tirelessly to make people aware of the struggles of farm workers for better pay and safer working conditions. It is a testament to Cesar Chavez's skills and courage that the UFW even survived. They  were opposed by major interests in corporate agriculture including the Bruce Church and Gallo Corporations as well as the leadership of the Republican Party then led by  Ronald Reagan.   Workers were  fired, beaten, threatened and even killed in pursuit of union benefits . Non union  farm workers today  continue to live on  sub-poverty wages while producing the abundant crops in the richest valley, in the richest state in the richest nation in the world.   



<p>In response to corporate power, Cesar developed new strategies, such as the boycott, based upon  his personal   commitment to  non-violence in the tradition of Ghandi and  Martin Luther King Jr.  César  Chavez died in his sleep on April 23, 1993 near Yuma, Arizona.



<p>César taught us that all organizations have problems, that all organizations are imperfect. But, if you wait for the perfect organization, nothing gets done. Building popular organizations builds people's power, and democracy.  Chavez' legacy to popular struggles, to  Chicano/Mexicano self determination and to unions for the immigrant workers is beyond measure.  He is present in all of our work.  I plan to celebrate March 31,2001 in memory of Cesar Chavez' contributions building a more democratic society for working people.
