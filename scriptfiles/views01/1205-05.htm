It is Prince of Peace season and America is at war.  Peace on earth,

goodwill to men is the usual mantra and our nation is in the sixth or

seventh week of bombing Afghanistan.  In the Holy Land, more suicide

bombers and missiles.  Merry and Happy are the words on the greeting

cards and tens of thousands of letters have been cross-contaminated with

anthrax spores.  Joy is the word in the hymns--are we singing along?   

<p>We seem to be subjects in a mass experiment in cognitive dissonance.

Maybe this is the real meltdown, the Y2K disaster we were fearing.  	

<p>"This is a test, it is only a test," says the Emergency Broadcast

System recording.  "For the next sixty seconds, you will hear a tone

that will be used to alert you in case of an actual emergency. 

Remember, this is only a test."

<p>This morning Tom Ridge was on television explaining that his

announcement yesterday was to "remind America one more time that we are

at war."  

<p>Without these reminders we might forget.

<p>What did you do in the war, Mommy?  I bought an SUV.  Sport Utility

Vehicle sales are higher than pickup trucks for the first time.  Used

primarily to go to shopping malls, our favorite sport.  Also used to

carry families, though the Census Bureau says that for the first time

less than one-fourth of households are married with children. 

<p>"It is good to have the Marines here in Times Square," Charles Gibson

said on "Good Morning America" this morning, showing Marines in a "light

armored vehicle," which is a skinny tank.  He said it can go 65 miles an

hour.  He sounded delighted.  "Perfect for combat in the cities.  It

handles better than a Caddy," says one website. "The Army hopes to buy

2,131 of the vehicles."  For the man who has everything, an LAV-III

under the Christmas tree.  Better than last war's Hummer.  

<p>This conversion to a militarized lifestyle is happening all through our

society.  We are on alert.  We are in a state of emergency.  We are

increasingly under martial law.  Constitutional protections have been

suspended for some people in some situations, or for everyone.

<p>Patriotism is most ardent when a nation is at war.  Only Congress can

declare war, Congress has not declared war, but we are most definitely

at war.  Peace flags are controversial.  We should ask why.  Does peace

undermine war?  Or does war undermine peace?  It is not so simple, of

course.   	"The test of a first-rate intelligence is the ability to hold

two opposed ideas in the mind at the same time, and still retain the

ability to function," is F. Scott Fitzgerald's line.

<p>Terrorism/democracy.  "An eye for an eye only ends up making the whole

world blind," is one of Gandhi's famous statements, in a variation on

what Jesus said in the Sermon on the Mount (Matthew 5).  U.S. government

policy apparently rejects both Jesus and Gandhi in favor of the

eye-for-an-eye equation.  We have "blind" justice and "blind rage." 

Albert Einstein said, "Peace cannot be achieved through violence, it can

only be attained through understanding."  But American policy makers

must believe they are smarter than Einstein. 

<p>James Park wrote, "Recent neuro-biological research has shown that you

cannot think clearly without engaging your emotions. Thinking and

feeling are inextricably intertwined, and many of the failings of our

political process arise from our reluctance to acknowledge the

implications of this fact. The question to be asked - about our public

and private lives - is how well we manage the interaction between the

two processes."

<p>Our hearts and minds are struggling, striving for an understanding of

the right thing to do, the right way to live.  Such striving is called

jihad, the greater jihad, in Arabic.  Christmas/war.  Ramadan/Hanukkah. 

It's cognitive dissonance for sure.  The countdown is on: almost three

months from September 11 and the fire of the World Trade Center

mausoleum is still burning.  Twenty shopping days until Christmas,

nineteen, eighteen....
