Here's the half of the story that the media and the Bush team 

bring you: Under cover of darkness, U.S. food packets rained from the sky 

like manna upon the hungriest parts of Afghanistan. 



<p>Here's the other half -- which requires some independent research and 

imagination: unguided crates crash to ground in the pitch black. Hungry 

Afghans rush to gather them up. Too late. Another explosion, then another. 

Parents watch in horror as the brightly colored packets tempt their children 

onto landmines. 



<p>We should be getting good at this by now. George W. and Donald Rumsfeld give 

us a bit of the story. The power press fill in some details. It's up to us to 

do the rest.



<p>In his address to the nation Sunday afternoon, George W. Bush announced that 

U.S. and British air strikes against Afghanistan had started. Also started, 

said Bush, were humanitarian aid drops. "We will also drop food, medicine and 

supplies to starving and suffering men and women and children of Afghanistan."



<p>An hour later, Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld confirmed that food drops 

had begun. Two U.S. C-17 cargo planes, flying low over remote regions under 

cover of night, were releasing 37,000 individual rations containing 

"foodstuffs culturally and religiously acceptable to the civilian Afghan 

population, as well as medicines, blankets and other items." 



<p>By the end of the day, media reports were elaborating: The "Humanitarian 

Daily Ration" packets were wrapped in yellow and white plastic. A photograph 

in the New York Times details the contents: beans with tomato sauce, peanut 

butter, strawberry jam, beans and tomato vinaigrette, biscuit, fruit pastry 

and shortbread, not to forget -- utensils, salt, pepper, napkin and a match. 

Nutritional value: 2,300 calories -- ideally, a day's supply. 



<p>Here's where the media-consuming public have to exercise some imagination and 

activate their historical memory. For help, we can turn to the excellent 

information that is on the record, compiled by, among others, the 

International Campaign to Ban Landmines (<a href="http://www.banminesusa.org" target="_new">www.banminesusa.org</a>) and 

humanitarian aid groups that work in Afghanistan like Oxfam. 



<p>The population of Afghanistan, we know, is roughly 20.9 million. UN agencies 

recently estimated some 7.5 million of those were "on the brink of disaster." 

What does the UN reckon is needed? $584 million in food aid and water aid 

before the onset of winter. The U.S. has pledged $320 million. 



<p>Oxfam reports that this is the last month that critical food and grain and 

medical aid can be shipped to some areas before the winter cuts them off. 

What is needed? Supplies to last local people not a day or two, but until 

spring. 



<p>52,000 tons per month should be delivered, reported Oxfam October 5. Some 

4,500 tons had been shipped out as of last week. "Since September 12, we 

estimate that little more than 15 percent of Afghanistan's pre-crisis food 

has been met, after a break of nearly three weeks," reported Oxfam, October 5.



<p>"To feed 6 million people we would need more than 125 flights of Hercules 

airplanes each day," says Paul Smith-Lomas, Oxfam's Humanitarian Director. 

"This might be mathematically possible but unlikely to happen because 

civilian planes cannot fly in a war zone." 



<p>And unlike in-the-field aid workers, U.S. troops flying on high, can do 

virtually nothing to guarantee where the food goes. Relief organizations 

working in the area say that the best way to deliver food into Afghanistan is 

by truck.



<p>Barbara Stocking, Oxfam's director, told the British Guardian that "all aid 

should be channeled through the UN "to be seen as impartial and separate from 

military action. Trucking of food is cheaper and is tried and tested. Air 

drops are risky, random, expensive, and likely to meet only a fraction of the 

need. Aid workers would be put in a difficult position if food aid came to be 

viewed as part of a military effort". 



<p>Yet in the run up to air strikes, fearing a massive influx of refugees, 

Pakistan, Iran and the former Soviet republics of Tajikistan and Uzbekistan 

closed their borders in line with an American request. 



<p>The director of the Catholic charity, Cafod, Julian Filichowski, said: "It is 

a matter of fact that even the threat of military action has made the 

humanitarian situation worse. The start of military attacks on Afghanistan, 

even if limited, will exacerbate problems." The threat alone, had sent tens 

of thousands of Afghans away from the urban areas where relief operations are 

already in place. 



<p>Sunday's U.S. and British air strikes were launched on a trapped nation; a 

day's worth of food for 37,000 was dropped on a land of 20 million people, 

some 7 million of whom are on the verge of starvation, many thousands of whom 

have fled their home areas to be stranded without access to aid.



<p>And rushing for those "humanitarian rations" may kill them. 



<p>According to the International Campaign: "Afghanistan remains one of the most 

mine and UXO [unexploded ordnance] affected countries in the world. According 

to the United Nations Mine Action Program for Afghanistan (MAPA), landmines 

and UXO contaminate 724 million square meters of land....Mined areas are 

still being discovered at a rate of 12 to 14 million square meters per year." 

Says the Campaign: "In the year 2000, an average of about eighty-eight 

casualties per month were attributed to landmines and unexploded ordnance 

(UXO) in Afghanistan."



<p>Alex Renton works for Oxfam International in Islamabad, Pakistan. "I cannot 

overstate how lethal it is to drop anything on Afghanistan," Renton said 

today.



<p>Bush and co will do that part of the story-telling that suits them. It is up 

to us to do the rest.
