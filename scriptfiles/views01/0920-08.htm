Many media voices are enlisting in the push toward war. CBS anchor Dan

Rather seemed more soldier than reporter on Monday’s Letterman show when

he endorsed the war drive and added: “George Bush is the President….

Wherever he wants me to line up, just tell me where.”



<p>It’s worth remembering that a similar push followed the last dreadful

act of terrorism against America on our soil, Oklahoma City. Many in the

mass media immediately began goading us toward retaliation against a

presumed Arab, Islamic enemy. Columnist Mike Royko called for the

overseas bombing of civilian infrastructures: “If it happens to be the

wrong country, well, too bad.”



<p>The bellicose rhetoric came to a stunning halt as soon as it was learned

that the anti-American terrorists were not from the Mideast. In fact,

one was from the Midwest -- Michigan. The leader was Timothy McVeigh,

who went to his death believing himself to be at war against the U.S.



<p>Perhaps the lesson to be learned from Oklahoma City is that our country

did not take the bait. The U.S. did not declare war on McVeigh and his

network of extremist fellow-travelers.  The Bill of Rights and civil

liberties were not trampled on the path to increased security.



<p>Instead, McVeigh and his accomplices were dealt with as a democracy

deals with mass murderers. They were apprehended, prosecuted and

punished after being given trials, lawyers, the right to confront

witnesses and challenge evidence. The armed fanatics who sympathized

with McVeigh were not all hunted down and destroyed, but they’ve

certainly been quieted.  Many of us abhor the death penalty that was

given to McVeigh, but the rule of law prevailed.



<p>The terrorists behind the attacks on the Twin Towers and the Pentagon

are more numerous, perhaps more dangerous and better protected than

McVeigh and friends. Still, it’s appalling how little mainstream media

have discussed relying on the rule of law -- international law -- to

pursue the foreign terrorists.



<p>Few news reports have pointed out that there is one body under

international law that can authorize military action: the United Nations

Security Council. If the U.S. has strong evidence against Osama bin

Laden and associates, and Afghanistan continues to refuse extradition to

the U.S., the two countries could negotiate  surrender of the suspects

to a neutral country for trial (as happened with Libyan agents tried for

the Lockerbie explosion). If that approach fails, the U.S. could present

its case to the Security Council, which could authorize the equivalent

of an international arrest warrant.



<p>That the United States of America should uphold and adhere to

international law is seen as preposterous, un-American and weak. In a

piece titled, “To War, Not to Court,” Washington Post columnist Charles

Krauthammer wrote: “Secretary of State Colin Powell’s first reaction to

the day of infamy was to pledge to ‘bring those responsible to justice.’

This is exactly wrong.”



<p>Fox News Channel offered a rare interview with an actual expert in

international law, Francis Boyle of University of Illinois, who offered

a step-by-step legal process for pursuing the terrorists -- which

provoked an indignant Bill O’Reilly to decry “empowering the U.N.”  Days

later on his show, one of the most watched on cable news, O’Reilly

advocated bombing and destroying the civilian infrastructures of

Afghanistan and Iraq, followed by attacks on Libya.



<p>Listening to the Krauthammers and O’Reillys and leaping into unilateral

action does more than undermine the rule of law. It isolates the U.S.

instead of isolating the terrorists. Much of the world will see an

excessive or misdirected U.S. military action as a tragic rerun of

adventures that have callously injured innocent civilians from Panama to

Iraq to Sudan.



<p>And a new misstep will breed ever more anti-American terrorists.
