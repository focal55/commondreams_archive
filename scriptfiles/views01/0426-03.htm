NO PRESIDENT since 1877, when Rutherford B. Hayes took the oath of office, has come to power with less legitimacy than George W. Bush.

<P>Having lost the popular vote by a record margin of more than half a million, President Bush shares with Hayes the dubious distinction of being the only 

other man whom many Americans believe also lost the electoral vote as well. As 

recently as last weekend, according to a CNN poll, 48 percent of all Americans 

did not believe that the man now residing in the White House won the election 

"fair and square."

<P>The results of the widely reported Florida recount conducted by the Miami 

Herald and USA Today, trumpeted in headlines as proof that Bush won the 

election, are unlikely to change this perception. Properly understood, those 

results show no such thing.

<P>The main thrust of the Herald account is that Bush would have increased his 

lead under most scenarios had the U.S. Supreme Court not intervened to stop 

the counting. Yet an astonishing fact is buried deep in the article: had all 

67 counties examined all the "under-votes" (those ballots which seemingly did 

not record a clear vote for president), Gore would have won Florida -- and the 

White House.

<P>Gore's margin of victory would have been by 393 votes under the most 

inclusive standard and by 299 votes under a more stringent standard. In this 

thicket of competing ways of conducting the recount, the only reasonable 

conclusion is this: who won hinges almost entirely on which standards are 

applied.

<P>Having come to office lacking a popular mandate, Bush has compounded his 

political problems by steadfastly refusing to govern from the center.

<P>Elected in good part because of his carefully cultivated image as a 

"compassionate conservative" and a "different kind of Republican," he quickly 

revealed -- through his nomination of John Ashcroft, his reversal of new Labor 

Department rules designed to prevent repetitive stress injuries, and his 

reneging on a highly touted campaign pledge to reduce carbon dioxide emissions 

-- that the moderate George W. Bush was a campaign creation, and one quickly 

discarded once in office. Not surprisingly, right-wingers have been ecstatic: 

in the words of Edwin J. Feulner, president of the conservative Heritage 

Foundation, the Bush administration is "more Reaganite than the Reagan 

administration." But for many Americans, who took Bush's campaign rhetoric 

seriously, his actions in office have come as a shock.

<P>Is running a deeply deceptive campaign, they wonder, the way -- as Bush 

promised time and again during the campaign -- to restore honor and integrity 

to the White House? In the final analysis, however, Bush's greatest 

vulnerability may come neither from his lingering legitimacy problems nor from 

the growing sense among Americans that the man now in the White House 

campaigned for president "in borrowed clothes" (as Bush once famously said of 

Al Gore), but rather from the simple but jarring realization that he does not 

share their fundamental values.

<P>The values gap between the president and the American public has been 

revealed most dramatically on the environment, where a series of provocative 

acts -- the proposal to drill in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, the 

violation of the campaign pledge on carbon dioxide, the perverse unwillingness 

to acknowledge the scientific evidence on global warming, and the disastrous 

proposal (quickly withdrawn) to end salmonella testing for meat served in 

school lunches -- has made clear that George W. Bush is a man who places 

profits and economic development above all competing values.

<P>So extreme has been Bush's policy on the environment that even the National 

Wildlife Foundation -- a centrist group with 4.5 million members, about half 

of them Republicans -- has sent the administration a message: "Mr. President," 

said NWF President Mark Van Putten, "stop the war on our environment and our 

national heritage."

<P>With even moderates like Van Putten angry and a growing number of 

congressional Republicans already jumping ship on the environment, the 

vulnerability of the Bush administration -- and of its philosophy of corporate 

profits above all -- is more and more apparent. Already, according to an 

ABC/Washington Post poll released this past week, 60 percent of the public 

believes Bush cares more about "protecting the interests of large corporations,

" compared to only 28 percent who believe he cares more about the interests of 

"ordinary working people."

<P>The veil of moderation, which permitted Bush to win the White House, has 

now been stripped away to reveal the president for who he is: a man willing to 

place the narrow, short-term interests of big business over our environment, 

our health and our safety.

<P>These are not the values of the American people. And as this becomes 

increasingly clear, the man who came to the presidency as the "values 

candidate" will ironically have to face a formidable, and perhaps fatal, 

values problem of his own.
