When it comes to international trade relations, the planet’s most powerful 

man is taking the moral high ground.  I mean President George W. Bush.  In a 

June 26 New York Times article about the prospects for trade relations 

between developed and developing nations, the president mentioned free trade 

as a “moral imperative.”  The context was talks following the November 

meeting in Qatar of the World Trade Organization, the unelected world body 

that governs the terms of global trade.



<p>Meanwhile, the Bush administration is continuing the Clinton 

administration’s policy that prevents Iraq from trading freely with other 

nations.  This has tragically hampered Iraq’s legal and moral right to 

self-determination.



<p>Under the current U.N. sanctions against Iraq that began on August 6, 1990, 

the Bush administration is trying to end Iraq’s border trade, Lauren Cannon 

writes. She’s with Voices in the Wilderness, a Chicago-based group working 

to end the sanctions, having just returned from Iraq on a humanitarian 

delegation.



<p>Supposedly, Iraqi revenue from border trade is funding weapons making.  

Based on this allegation, the Bush administration is preventing Iraq from 

raising funds to rebuild its infrastructure such as water treatment plants.



<p>“Because of the direct targeting of the water treatment plants during the 

Gulf War (documented in the recently de-classified DIA papers), Iraq has a 

greatly reduced capacity to treat solid waste,” Cannon writes.  “We learned 

from UNICEF on June 20 that they have tracked a six-fold increase in normal 

water pollution over this decade of sanctions, and that a full six million 

people are at risk in Iraq for lack of clean water.



<p>“Dr. Carel DeRooy, Director of Health and Nutrition for UNICEF, stated that 

$1 billion is needed to repair the water treatment facilities in the central 

and south of Iraq (a conservative estimate by many accounts).”



<p>Iraq is a nation of 23 million people. According to UNICEF, 500,000 Iraqi 

children would be alive today if 1990 conditions in Iraq had continued 

through 1998.  The sanctions have claimed the lives of over one million 

innocent Iraqis, whose deaths would be more newsworthy in the U.S. if they 

had white skin.



<p>The U.S., with over 12 times as many people as Iraq, is the world’s biggest 

economy.  In addition, the U.S. is the leading importer of oil.  The U.S. 

military presence in the Middle East is directly related to its oil 

dependence and car-centered economy.



<p>For the U.S., trade relations are based in big part on its domination of the 

global oil market and competition with Japan and the European Union.  Oil is 

the essential energy source for economic activity around the world.  Energy 

sources such as wind and solar power are simply no alternative to oil, the 

International Energy Agency reported in 1998.



<p>On one hand, Iraq has the world’s second largest estimated crude oil 

reserves after Saudi Arabia.  On the other hand, keeping Iraq flat on its 

back with cruel economic sanctions neuters that nation’s ability to alter 

the U.S.-led balance of power in the region.  That power over Japanese and 

European competitors is flowing from control over Middle East oil, “a 

stupendous source of strategic power, and one of the greatest material 

prizes in world history,” according to the U.S. State Department in 1945.  

Today, U.S. policymakers speak instead about the need for “stability” in the 

Middle East.  Old wine in new bottles.



<p>Currently, a British proposal to modify the sanctions against Iraq is being 

deliberated at the U.N.  However the proposed change to so-called “smart 

sanctions” is more about spinning a new image of economic barbarism than 

offering concrete relief to the Iraqi people, according to Father Simon 

Harak.  “Sanctions should be lifted, not smartened,” Cannon adds.



<p>If his moral sense about free trade meant anything other than helping U.S. 

corporations gain market share and boost profits, Bush would allow Iraq to 

rebuild its infrastructure.  To do this, Iraq needs to have normal economic 

relations with the rest of the world.  Then, every fourth Iraqi child 

wouldn’t be underweight, with one in 10 being felled by disease and hunger.  

And Iraqi hospitals would be filled with basic medicine and equipment, as 

they were before the Gulf War, when Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein was a U.S. 

ally.



<p>To mislead public opinion about U.S. foreign policy, Bush uses the term 

“free trade” in part to direct attention away from the barbaric reality of 

U.S. Iraq policy.  While the president moralizes about the need for global 

“free trade,” his administration is working to prevent Iraq from trading 

freely.
