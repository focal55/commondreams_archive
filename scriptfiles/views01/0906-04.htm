THEY CAME late and left early.
<p>That's how Jesse Jackson summed up the way the United States government's delegation to the World Conference Against Racism, now meeting in Durban, South Africa, treated this event.
<p>The head of the U.S. delegation wasn't in his seat for the opening ceremony. And on Monday - while delegations from South Africa and Belgium, two countries with terrible histories of racial oppression, struggled to work out a compromise that everyone could agree on - the United States and Israel left in a huff.
<p>Like children who can't stand being chastised, they took their toys and went home. By leaving, they showed the disdain they had clearly felt for the conference all along. They should have stayed and tried to work things out.
<p>The sticking point was language in the conference's draft resolution, singling out Israel for its allegedly racist treatment of the Palestinians. The language called Israel by name - alone among all the countries in Durban - and should never have been included. It was pushed by Arab countries that are incensed by the current violence between the Israelis and Palestinians. But the delegates should have stayed and fought the language, not simply have walked out.
<p>Michael McClintock, deputy program director of Human Rights Watch, points out that declarations of this type are adopted only by consensus. If a nation objects to any of the language, it goes out or the declaration doesn't fly. The language against Israel would not have made its way into the final document, he said.
<p>While the declaration contains language indirectly criticizing virtually every country at the conference for one regrettable practice or another, only Israel and the United States walked out. I can understand Israel's decision to leave, since it's involved in deadly hostilities with the Palestinians and isn't in the mood to be taunted any further in Durban. But there's no excuse for the United States' hasty retreat. You don't attend a conference on racism if you're not prepared to deal with stuff you don't like, including criticism of your own failures in that area. And that, in part, is what the walkout was about.
<p>Some Americans representing non-government groups in Durban contend the United States didn't want to stay at the conference for fear of being confronted about such sensitive issues as racism in its criminal-justice system, the racial way it applies the death penalty and the hot-button issue of whether it owes African Americans reparations for slavery.
<p>"I think they wanted to walk out," McClintock says, noting that U.S. officials admitted before the conference started that they wanted to avoid any new international commitments to confront racism at home. 
<p>Lately, the United States has been backing off of international commitments that could require oversight by other countries or the United Nations, repudiating the ABM missile treaty and refusing to ratify a convention on the rights of the child, which Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) claimed would come between parents and their children.
<p>Meanwhile, the European delegations stayed in Durban, even though the declaration criticizes discrimination against economic refugees and gypsies and expresses regret for past slavery, issues on which their countries are culpable. India stayed, even though its unofficial caste system is under fire. Latin American countries stayed, even though discrimination against African Latinos is being discussed. And the African countries stayed, despite language in the declaration about brutal treatment of indigenous people and about slavery.
<p>Granted, the Durban conference has been temporarily hijacked by the Arab countries, who are intent on embarrassing Israel. But Israel and the United States behaved as if these were terrorists they absolutely don't negotiate with. They aren't. They're delegates to a convention. And these two countries should have stayed and used their clout to tone them down.
