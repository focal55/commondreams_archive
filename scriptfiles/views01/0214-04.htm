THE VALENTINES are floating all over the Grammys now that the gay Elton John will do a duet with the gay-bashing Eminem. Such dates leave you with only two conclusions. One is that John thinks he is the recording uncle who can persuade his nihilistic nephew to go into diversity training.

<P>

<P>The other is that this moment has less to do with hearts than a heartless manipulation. Eminem gets gay activists off his back for a hot minute and John rides Eminem's back into the fires of renewed fame, another Santana who dusts himself off by jamming with new jacks and new janes like Lauryn Hill.

<P>

<P>Eminem is a ghastly parallel to Hill. While Hill has made the Ladies Home Journal's list of the most important women, thugs who carry out Eminem's fantasies of rape and domestic violence land on the Most-Wanted List.

<P>

<P>This has not stopped the fools at the Grammies from blessing Eminem with a nomination for album of the year. Eminem's defenders say this shows a profound respect for free speech.     

<P>

<P>John defends his reclamation efforts by saying he cannot believe Eminem really believes what he raps about. ''I'd rather tear down walls between people than build them up,'' John said ''If I thought for one minute that he was a hateful bastard, I wouldn't do it.''

<P>

<P>Eminem and all the barely literate rappers and rockers, white, black, and polka dot, have the right to rant all they want about homosexuals and women. If Eminem had shown some clear signs of remorse in issuing his invitation to John to perform together, it would be fine for John to pull up to Eminem's pad and then take his new nephew out for a long ride and a long lecture down the Pacific Coast Highway.

<P>

<P>But to let this gutterally immature manchild wrap the entertainment world around his upwardly pointed middle finger, a finger that shows no signs of losing its rigidity, is to reward depravity. There is too much real damage being done by people who think like Eminem to let the likes of him control the stage.

<P>

<P>This week the FBI released its annual hate crimes report. Of the 7,826 bias-motivated incidents that were reported around the nation in 1999, 17 percent of the incidents involved attacks on gay men and lesbian women.

<P>

<P>While Eminem makes millions of dollars telling young listeners to ''hate fags,'' the FBI recorded 127 attacks on gays at schools and on college campuses. Just last weekend, Carroll College in Helena, Mont., reported that an openly gay student had withdrawn from school. He was on his way back to his dorm room after taking a shower when someone wielding a bottle knocked him out.

<P>

<P>The attack renewed a call for the state Legislature to expand the state hate crimes law to include sexual orientation. But just as President Bush let such calls die in committee when he was governor of Texas in the wake of the lynching of James Byrd, the Montana House tabled the bill in committee. Some Montana legislators want to go further in the other direction and drop the provision in Montana's employment guidelines that forbids discrimination against gay and lesbian state workers.

<P>

<P>The sponsor of the bill to expand hate crimes protections in Montana, Brad Newman of Butte, said: ''This isn't a hypothetical debate. This is a real and present danger to our society.''

<P>

<P>While openly gay men and lesbian women are gaining more and more acceptance in the mainstream, the danger of being singled out for violence remains too real to bestow the highest of music honors to someone who raps that ''faggots'' should be held at ''knifepoint'' or that a gay man should do Eminem the honor of uncritically accepting an invitation.

<P>

<P>It is fine and honorable to love one's enemies, but sometimes the best love is tough love. Tough love is something that seems in short supply lately. Up on Capitol Hill, you had Wisconsin Senator Russell Feingold offering an ''olive branch'' of support to new Attorney General John Ashcroft, despite plenty of evidence that Ashcroft has rarely cared for the rights of homosexuals, African-Americans, or women in his long career.

<P>

<P>No one is betting the house that Feingold will be rewarded with the second coming of Thurgood Marshall. Likewise, no sane person can Think that if Eminem wins album of the year and John raps with him without Eminem himself having to account for his lyrics, the event will do anything except inspire this deranged mind to further, hideous manipulations.

<P>

<P>It may be Valentine's Day, and Elton John may think he is capable of getting some love back if he shows some to Eminem. That's all nice and sweet sounding. But first, Eminem has to write his own Valentine not just to John, but to all the world's homosexuals. He cannot be allowed to get away with embracing one gay man while telling his listeners to hate the rest.
