        who watched the news media rush to judgment on Election Night -- first

        awarding Florida to Al Gore and then giving it to George W. Bush and

        then settling on &quot;too close to call&quot; -- might have thought the

        national press corps had learned its lesson.

</font>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">You might have thought

        that major news organizations would at least wait for the final tallies

        in the unofficial recounts now underway before calling a winner.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If you had that expectation,

        you'd be disappointed again.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The latest bizarre example of

        the news media's compulsive rush to judgment has come in the handling of

        a <i>Miami Herald/USA Today</i> report about an unofficial tally of

        Miami-Dade &quot;undervotes,&quot; ballots that were rejected by

        counting machines as registering no choice for president.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The latest facts were these:

        After examining Miami-Dade's 10,646 undervotes -- out of about 60,000

        statewide -- this unofficial tally found Gore closing to within about

        140 votes of Bush. In other words with nearly 50,000 undervotes still to

        be examined, only about 140 votes separated the two candidates.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Those who have been following

        the work of other Florida news organizations in other counties also

        would know that hundreds of uncounted votes clearly intended for Gore or

        Bush had been discovered over the past two months, both in &quot;undervotes&quot;

        and in &quot;overvotes&quot; in which voters had marked their ballot for

        a candidate and then written in the candidate's name.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">From these other unofficial

        tallies, Gore had made surprising net gains in some counties that had

        favored Bush overall. By some counts, Gore even had pulled ahead of

        Bush, though clearly the outcome of these unofficial tallies remained in

        doubt.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Once all the counting was over,

        it seemed plausible that either Bush might hold on to a narrow lead or

        that Gore might inch ahead.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Either result, of course, would

        not change the fact that Bush had been awarded Florida’s 25 electoral

        votes and had become the first national popular-vote loser in more than

        a century to claim the White House.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Nor would the unofficial tallies

        change the reality that Gore almost certainly was the choice of a

        plurality of Floridians -- if not for the confusing ballot in Palm Beach

        County, which apparently caused thousands of elderly Jews to vote for

        Pat Buchanan, and the state's alleged purging of thousands of

        African-Americans from the rolls on the grounds that their names were

        similar to those of convicted felons.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The unofficial newspaper tallies

        were intended only as an historical marker. So why the rush? Wouldn’t

        it make sense to wait until the statewide tallies were complete so as

        not to sow any more confusion and distrust? At minimum, wouldn’t it be

        reasonable to make clear how limited any new partial tally was?</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Not in the Cards</b></font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">That apparently is not how the

        American news media works anymore. The big-name news organizations

        seemed to have learned nothing from Election Night.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Rather than cautious, balanced

        stories about the limits of the new Miami-Dade tabulation, the news

        media rushed to declare Bush the legitimate winner in Florida and thus

        of the presidency.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">“If a manual recount of

        presidential ballots had gone forward in Miami-Dade County, George W.

        Bush likely would have won the presidency outright,” wrote the <i>Miami

        Herald</i>. [Feb. 26, 2001]</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">“Review Finds Bush Won Despite

        Miami Recount,” declared a headline in <i>The Washington Post</i>.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">“A review of Florida ballots

        suggested Gore wouldn’t have gained enough in a recount to win the

        presidency, the <i>Miami Herald</i> said,’’ summarized the <i>Wall

        Street Journal</i>.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">By Monday evening on television,

        the limited findings of the <i>Miami Herald</i> had been transformed

        into the final word that Bush really did win the election. Without

        doubt, millions of Americans who still have faith in the national news

        media will go away with that impression.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Yet, besides exaggerating the

        conclusions, the articles were misleading in another way. They suggested

        that the only recounts that mattered were the ones in South Florida

        where the Gore campaign first raised questions about the results. The

        hook for the <i>Miami Herald</i> story really was that if Bush and his

        campaign had not frustrated those early recounts, they still would have

        been slightly ahead.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But the decisive recount issue

        was not the count in South Florida. It was Bush's success in having his

        five conservative allies on the U.S. Supreme Court overturn a ruling by

        the Florida Supreme Court that had mandated a <i>statewide</i> recount

        of the so-called undervotes.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">That recount of 69 Florida

        counties was underway on Dec. 9 when the five conservative justices in

        Washington took the unprecedented step of halting the counting of votes

        in a U.S. presidential election. Then, on Dec. 12, they prevented a

        resumption of the recount, effectively handing the presidency to Bush.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If there were to be any

        meaningful measure about whether history was altered by that decision,

        it should have been made against the statewide recount, not simply the

        recount in South Florida.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Even more to the point is the

        question of what was the will of the Florida voters. Even casting aside

        the irregularities, did ballots registering clear intent of voters favor

        Gore or Bush?</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">These key issues were ignored by

        virtually all the news reports on Monday. The story was quite simple:

        Bush wins, this time for real.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

As on Election Night – though

        without the excuse of the deadline pressure – the national press corps

        had demonstrated once more how much of a threat it has become to the

        goal of an informed electorate.
