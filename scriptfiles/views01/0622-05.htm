PERU IS A NATION struggling to recover from the corrupt and anti-democratic rule of the absconded former president Alberto Fujimori and his fugitive intelligence boss, Vladimiro Montesinos. If Peru's quest for democracy is to be judged by the second sham trial and conviction of former MIT student Lori Berenson, then Americans may conclude that the personnel and the practices of the old regime have survived the fall of Fujimori and Montesinos.

<P>



<p>The prosecutors in the trial that concluded Thursday were the same ones who obtained Berenson's conviction by hooded military judges five years ago. They were appointed by Fujimori. The antiterrorism laws under which the civilian trial was conducted were Fujimori's handiwork.

<P>







<p>In the trial before the hooded officers, testimony was allowed that had been taken from suspects and witnesses who were tortured, terrorized, and deprived of medical attention. The accused were denied the right to meet with a lawyer before being interrogated. 

<P>







<p>Those perversions of justice are crucial because the civilian trial was nothing more than a retrying of the case that the faceless military judges had heard. That military verdict had been overturned by Fujimori's regime because of pressure from Washington. Berenson's Peruvian lawyer played for the civilian magistrates videotapes of the spy chief Montesinos saying in January 1998 that he would have Berenson's original conviction overturned and have her retried in a civilian court to placate the United States and international opinion.

<P>







<p>''Right now I could tell the Supreme Council of Military Justice to bring her from [her prison in] Yamamayo,''  Montesinos said on the tape. ''We don't need to consult with anyone.''

<P>







<p>Montesinos was heard saying he can have Berenson tried and convicted again and sentenced to 10 or 15 years. In other words, the three magistrates who sentenced Berenson to 20 years heard Montesinos say on tape, in their courtroom, that they were  his political pawns. 

<P>







<p>The civilian judges heard only the same tainted evidence as did the military tribunal. Only the original charges were changed. Instead of being accused of being a terrorist ringleader, Berenson was charged with being a collaborator with terrorists. And there was no evidence to prove that charge. There was only what the presiding magistrate called ''a spider web of coincidences.''

<P>







<p>To show he is different from Fujimori and Montesinos, Peru's President-elect Alejandro Toledo should pardon Berenson immediately. If Toledo feels it would be easier politically to have the interim president, Valentin Paniagua, issue the pardon, then he should do so. When Toledo comes to Washington on Sunday to ask for economic aid, he should be told that Peru cannot construct a true rule of law from the system left behind by Fujimori.
