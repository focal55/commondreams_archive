Condemning the conservatism of George W. Bush&#039;s Republicans and the caution of congressional Democrats, the new Green Party of the United States is moving to formalize its position as a progressive alternative to two-party politics.
<P>At the annual meeting of the Association of State Green Parties, the loose confederation of Green groups responsible for nominating Ralph Nader and Winona LaDuke for president and vice president in 2000, activists from 30 states - including Wisconsin - agreed to create a formal Green Party of the United States. In coming weeks, they plan to file paperwork to create a Green Party National Committee with the Federal Election Commission, and they will then ramp up national party building and electoral efforts.
<P>&#034;Legally speaking, the filing of the paperwork means that we are recognized as the Green Party of the United States and sets us up to nominate candidates for president and vice president in 2004. Practically, it means that we are getting serious about forming a real national party,&#034; said Green national organizer Dean Myerson.
<P>In addition to placing field organizers in states across the country before the 2002 elections, the Green Party of the United States plans to open a national office, increase outreach to people of color, step up efforts to recruit candidates and develop the party&#039;s fund-raising capacity.
<P>&#034;This step, although it sounds sort of technical, means that there are going to be aggressive and energized efforts to build a national party,&#034; Myerson said.
<P>After an election in which the Green ticket won 3 percent of the vote nationally - with higher totals in Alaska, Washington, Oregon and a number of other states - the announcement of stepped-up Green Party activism at the national level is a significant development not just for advocates of the third party, but also for supporters of the Democratic and Republican parties.
<P>A number of national Democrats have blamed Nader and the Greens for drawing enough votes away from Democratic nominee Al Gore to tip the crucial states of Florida and New Hampshire to Republican Bush. &#034;Nader cost us the election,&#034; says Sen. Joseph Biden Jr., D-Del., bluntly echoing the sentiments of many - though not all - congressional Democrats. At the same time, former Labor Secretary Robert Reich acknowledged in a recent article that Green Party activists around the country are among those filling &#034;a large and growing political vacuum&#034; created by the failure of the national Democratic Party to address fundamental issues of social and economic justice.
<P>Greens now hold 91 local elective posts around the country, and party activists believe there is room for the party to establish a larger presence nationally. &#034;The two major parties, with their stranglehold on American democracy, should see this development as a threat,&#034; said Steve Schmidt, chair of the committee responsible for developing the Greens&#039; platform. &#034;For those who support the ideals and political goals of the Greens, it&#039;s cause for celebration.&#034;
<P>Nancy Allen, a Maine Green, eschews the line that Democrats and Republicans are indistinguishable, instead arguing that they are not different enough when it comes to challenging corporate power, supporting meaningful electoral reform and backing living wage and universal health care initiatives.
<P>&#034;The Democrats and Republicans aren&#039;t identical. But as the Democrats have retreated further and further from populist principles, they&#039;ve given Republicans the license to move to even greater extremes,&#034; Allen says. &#034;That&#039;s why more Greens are winning more elections now. We&#039;re not beholden to corporate interests. We want to do better than represent voters - we want Americans to have the democratic power to speak for themselves, to strengthen civic participation. You won&#039;t hear that kind of subversive talk from Democrats or Republicans!&#034;</p>
