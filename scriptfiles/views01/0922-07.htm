In his address to Congress Thursday, George Bush effectively declared 

permanent war -- war without temporal or geographic limits; war without 

clear goals; war against a vaguely defined and constantly shifting enemy. 

Today it's Al-Qaida; tomorrow it may be Afghanistan; next year, it could be 

Iraq or Cuba or Chechnya.



<p>No one who was forced to read <i>1984</i> in high school could fail to hear a 

faint bell tinkling. In George Orwell's dreary classic, the totalitarian 

state of Oceania is perpetually at war with either Eurasia or Eastasia. 

Although the enemy changes periodically, the war is permanent; its true 

purpose is to control dissent and sustain dictatorship by nurturing popular 

fear and hatred.



<p>The permanent war undergirds every aspect of Big Brother's authoritarian 

program, excusing censorship, propaganda, secret police, and privation. In 

other words, it's terribly convenient.



<p>And conveniently terrible. Bush's alarming speech pointed to a shadowy 

enemy that lurks in more 60 countries, including the US. He announced a 

policy of using maximum force against any individuals or nations he 

designates as our enemies, without color of international law, due process, 

or democratic debate.



<p>He explicitly warned that much of the war will be conducted in secret. He 

rejected negotiation as a tool of diplomacy. He announced starkly that any 

country that doesn't knuckle under to US demands will be regarded as an 

enemy. He heralded the creation of a powerful new cabinet-level police 

agency called the "Office of Homeland Security." Orwell couldn't have named 

it better.



<p>By turns folksy ("Ya know what?") and chillingly bellicose ("Either you are 

with us, or you are with the terrorists"), Bush stepped comfortably into 

the role of Big Brother, who needs to be loved as well as feared. 

Meanwhile, his administration acted swiftly to realize the governing 

principles of Oceania:



<p>WAR IS PEACE. A reckless war that will likely bring about a deadly cycle of 

retaliation is being sold to us as the means to guarantee our safety. 

Meanwhile, we've been instructed to accept the permanent war as a fact of 

daily life. As the inevitable slaughter of innocents unfolds overseas, we 

are to "live our lives and hug our children."



<p>FREEDOM IS SLAVERY. "Freedom itself is under attack," Bush said, and he's 

right. Americans are about to lose many of their most cherished liberties 

in a frenzy of paranoid legislation. The government proposes to tap our 

phones, read our email and seize our credit card records without court 

order. It seeks authority to detain and deport immigrants without cause or 

trial. It proposes to use foreign agents to spy on American citizens. To 

save freedom, the warmongers intend to destroy it.



<p>IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH. America's "new war" against terrorism will be fought 

with unprecedented secrecy, including heavy press restrictions not seen for 

years, the Pentagon has advised. Meanwhile, the sorry history of American 

imperialism -- collaboration with terrorists, bloody proxy wars against 

civilians, forcible replacement of democratic governments with corrupt 

dictatorships -- is strictly off-limits to mainstream media. Lest it weaken 

our resolve, we are not to be allowed to understand the reasons underlying 

the horrifying crimes of September 11.



<p>The defining speech of Bush's presidency points toward an Orwellian future 

of endless war, expedient lies, and ubiquitous social control. But unlike 

1984's doomed protagonist, we've still got plenty of space to maneuver and 

plenty of ways to resist.



<p>It's time to speak and to act. It falls on us now to take to the streets, 

bearing a clear message for the warmongers: We don't love Big Brother.
