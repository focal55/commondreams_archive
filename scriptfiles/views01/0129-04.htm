Sometimes honesty can be the best policy, even in

politics. This is a hard sell here in Washington, where the

truth is treated with so little respect, and spin is

everything. But perhaps the Democrats and their allies are

learning a lesson as George W. Bush's proposal for a tax

cut gathers momentum.



         <p>Here is a tax cut that is truly a gift to the rich and

the super-rich. One of its biggest components is to

abolish the estate tax. This would give hundreds of

billions of dollars to those who need it the least: people

who are born into enormous wealth. Two-thirds of this

tax is paid by the richest two-tenths of one percent of all

taxpayers.



         <p>There is no ambiguity here. Mr. Bush advocated

this cut during his campaign for the Presidency, and the

Republican Congress actually passed it last September.

The legislation was vetoed by President Clinton.



         <p>You might think that the Democratic leadership,

which opposes these tax cuts, would be bold enough to

suggest that maybe Bill Gates' kids don't need another

break at the expense of the US Treasury. Not so. They

have chosen instead to argue from an ultra-conservative

standpoint: we can't afford the tax cuts because we need

to use federal budget surpluses to pay off the national

debt.



         <p>From an economic perspective, the idea of paying

off the national debt as soon as possible has never made

much sense. Of course anyone who has a mortgage on

their house would like to save on future interest payments

by paying it off early. But should they sacrifice their

children's health care and education in order to do so?

Most people would say no. Economists would go further,

pointing out that it does not make sense to use surplus

funds to pay off debt when there is an alternative that

yields a return higher than the interest on the debt.



         <p>Our national debt is quite low relative to our

economy, and that is all that matters. It currently stands at

about 35 percent of GDP, down from 49 percent just 5

years ago. It really shouldn't be an issue, and if not for the

demagoguery of politicians, it wouldn't be.



         <p>The Democratic strategy was hit hard last week

when Fed Chair Alan Greenspan said that we could

indeed afford a tax cut, and that in fact he was concerned

that without one we might pay off the national debt too

quickly.



         <p>Greenspan's remarks were obviously politically

motivated. Would he have said the same thing if we had a

president proposing $1.6 trillion in new spending-- rather

than a tax cut-- over the next decade? To ask the question

is to answer it.



         <p>But here, too, the Democrats have painted

themselves into a corner by joining in the deification of

Mr. Greenspan, exaggerating beyond recognition not only

his impartiality but his competence.



         <p>This is a man who has repeatedly thrown

hundreds of thousands of people out of work-- by raising

interest rates-- in order to keep wages from rising. So

anyone who reads the business press should not be

surprised that he supports tax cuts for rich people.



         <p>If they want to give Greenspan credit for not

pulling the plug on the economy for nine and a half years,

fine. But this praise should be of the kind given to a

compulsive gambler gone straight: he crashed the

economy in 1990, sending it into recession by hiking

interest rates to 10 percent the previous year. He kept

unemployment much higher than necessary for several

years, by adhering to a theory-- now thankfully

abandoned-- that six percent was the best that we could

do without accelerating inflation.



         <p>And now, as we see layoffs soaring at companies

throughout the country, does it really take that much

political courage to question the six interest-rate hikes

since June 1999 that helped bring on the current

slowdown? Or does the "Maestro"-- as journalist Bob

Woodward titled his fawning portrayal of Mr. Greenspan-

- only merit praise for trying to put the toothpaste back in

the tube?



         <p>Now that the Democrats have been let down by

both the Fed chairman and their own fatally flawed

arguments, here's a new, more honest strategy. Propose a

tax cut for the majority of Americans, with an increase in

the Earned Income Tax Credit for those at the bottom of

the wage scale.



         <p>Then ask the citizens a simple question: who

should get tax relief? The richest one percent of

Americans, who have more than doubled their real

(inflation-adjusted) after tax income over the last 23

years? Or the majority of Americans, whose income has

stagnated?



         

<p>They'll get the answer they want to hear -- and no

one will care whether Mr. Greenspan agrees.
