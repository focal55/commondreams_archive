There was no new science, and not much news, in the National Academy of Sciences' midweek report to President Bush affirming the severe threat of global warming. In fact, its most interesting page is the White House letter seeking fast-track review of scientific knowledge to date:

<P><i>"The administration is conducting a review of U.S. policy on climate change. We seek the academy's assistance in identifying the areas in the science of climate change where there are the greatest certainties and uncertainties. We would also like your views on whether there are any substantive differences between the IPCC Reports and the IPCC summaries. We would appreciate a response as soon as possible."</i></P>

<P>That's the entire text -- four sentences that speak volumes about the Bush administration's unfortunate approach to a critical issue. It's a strategy of relentless searching for weasel room in an area where scientists have long since reached an extraordinarily wide, if not universal, consensus.</P>

<P>Take the request concerning work by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a United Nations group that has issued three voluminous and increasingly dire reports on world scientific consensus. Global warming "skeptics" -- quibblers is a better word -- assert that IPCC's summaries not only simplify the underlying research but intensify its conclusions. The academy reviewers, who included a prominent global-warming dissenter from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, found otherwise.</P>

<P>As for "certainties and uncertainties," the letter again echoes those who seek to shift the discussion away from the core of agreement and toward the periphery.</P>

<P>Anyone who has been paying moderate attention can summarize the certainties: that the atmosphere is warming at an unusually rapid rate, that the burning of fossil fuels is the biggest factor driving this change, that the consequences are likely to range from severe to catastrophic, that the difficulty of heading off those consequences only increases with delay in getting started. Lesser certainty surrounds attempts to forecast impacts by locale or time period, and there is considerable debate over which mitigation strategies -- other than reducing oil and coal consumption -- are most promising.</P>

<P>The timing of the letter is interesting, too, coming so long after Bush's pronouncement that the United States would no longer honor the Kyoto protocols for cutting emissions, his reversal of a campaign pledge to begin regulating carbon dioxide as a pollutant and his unveiling of a U.S. energy program that will worsen the problem.</P>

<P>What can be made of a policy review that comes after the policy has been changed? Only that the president, on his way to a well-deserved upbraiding from the leaders of industrialized Europe, was looking for more weasel room. A little more dissent on the warming forecasts, perhaps, or some scientific credibility to wrap around the voluntary mitigation schemes that Europe has already rejected as inadequate.</P>

<P>To its credit, the academy has given him nothing of the kind.</P>
