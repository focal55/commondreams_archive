Last week, I ran into a friend I worked with twenty years ago at a senior

center. Lately, he's been working on emergency preparedness--helping Seattle

retrofit its homes, businesses, and schools to withstand major earthquakes.

Supported by the Federal Emergency Management Agency's $25-million Project

Impact, my friend has been developing and promoting inexpensive solutions,

and training homeowners, builders and contractors.



<p>"What a great program," I said, "because sooner or later, the big one's

going to hit!" Unfortunately, a few days after our conversation, President

Bush targeted Project Impact to be eliminated -- to help him give $70 billion

in tax cuts to the richest 1% of Americans.



<p>Later that same day-Wednesday -- a major earthquake hit Seattle. My cat fled,

an instant before, and stayed hidden beneath the couch for the afternoon. I

grabbed my swaying computer and pushed back sliding file drawers. Pictures

fell off bookshelves, shattering their glass. But otherwise my family was

completely unharmed. And the city as a whole emerged relatively unscathed.

We saved priceless lives and untold dollars in part because this was a deep

quake, less damaging than "the big one" still possible, but also because

Seattle has been steadily retrofitting vulnerable buildings, bridges, and

highways through public programs like Project Impact.



<p>The earthquake -- and Bush's same-day proposed elimination of the very program

that helped us prepare for it -- underscores the folly of believing Margaret

Thatcher's pronouncement that "There is no such thing as society -- there are

only individual families." Invest in our infrastructure, and it will stay

mostly solid, even while the ground shakes, rattles, and rolls beneath it.

Invest in all our children, and they'll grow up healthy and strong. Invest

in our communities, and ordinary citizens will feel hopeful. Invest in

technologies like wind power, compact-fluorescent light bulbs, and efficient

mass transit, and we won't have to choose between rationing electricity and

despoiling our environment.



<p>Instead, despite recent prosperous times, we've continued to accentuate what

John Kenneth Galbraith once called "private affluence and public squalor."

Even before the earthquake, the state of Washington (whose

disproportionately plentiful billionaires enjoy one of the most regressive

local tax systems in the nation) was planning to slash $200 million from the

budgets for mental health services, subsidized dental care, and other

programs serving the poorest and most vulnerable. Nationwide, nearly 50

million Americans lack health insurance. Our new recession threatens more

unemployment -- and disaster for those hitting welfare term limits. Now, after

losing by more than a half million votes and being handed the election by

his friends in high places, our President is proposing the most regressive

tax cut in twenty years.



<p>We'd all welcome a "refund" from the feds, but the earthquake reminded me

that neglecting to invest in our common future undermines the foundation of

our society. I'd love to see real tax reform, so that as a self-employed

person averaging $30,000 a year and paying both income and social security

taxes, I'd no longer pay at a higher rate than Bill Gates does when selling

a billion dollars of Microsoft stock. But this proposal gives the bulk of

its benefits to that tiny minority of Americans who already control the vast

share of our national wealth.  It slashes the resources available to address

America's real crises, and to build for our future.



<p>As former Rep. Ron Dellums (D-Berkeley) once said, you learn a lot more

about the state of a nation's soul by looking at its budgets than by heeding

the words of its politicians. It's nice that President Bush sends Seattle

his prayers. But hard commitment goes further than easy compassion, not only

for "the big ones" still looming, but also for the largely invisible

disasters that so many of our citizens face day after day.
