Profound ignorance is clearly the reason Westerners allow their governments

and corporations to get away with brutal environmental murder. It is not

merely that the culprits do it surreptitiously. There is that. Much of

the assault on man's only source of livelihood is concealed – ignored by

the corporate media.

<p>But this only contributes to the more important kind of ignorance, unawareness

of what constitutes ecological death and degradation of the human habitat

and what that portends for humanity.

<p>That is why, only a few weeks after he took office, US President George

Bush does not feel embarrassed or threatened when he publicly reneges on

an election campaign pledge. His administration has rejected all of the

international treaties recently made to protect mankind from a habitat

rapidly rotting.

<p>He can go back on his word because he knows few Americans will challenge

him on it. Apathy feeds on the ignorance, daily encouraging the political

system – acting chiefly for a deliriously greedy corporate family – to

perperate heinous crimes against mankind.

<p>For the state and the pachyderms called corporations are but the head

and tail sides of the same coin. The President comes from a Texas family

so avarious for oil that in 1991, when his father was the occupant of the

Oval Office, the state squandered huge public resources to brutalitalise

the Middle East to secure oil to feed the maws of corporate industry.

<p>Of course, the big media – being part of that family – could not put

it that way. Bryan Appleyard comments in<i> Brave New Worlds: Genetics

and the Human Experience: </i>"Even when the real justification for warfare

is economic or strategic, the rhetoric of war is invariably moral. In the

Persian Gulf War of 1991, the Allies did not free Kuwait from Iraq...with

cries of 'Oil!' but rather with cries of 'Freedom!'..."

<p>Apologists often argue that the corporations do not do it wilfully,

that, if they cause any destruction, it is only because they cannot foretell

the environmental consequences of deploying any technique.

<p>Here, for instance, is Barry Commoner in <i>The Closing Circle:</i>

"Driven by an inherent tendency to maximise profits, modern private enterprise

has seized upon those massive technological innovations that promise to

gratify this need, usually <i>unaware</i> that these innovations are often

instruments of environmental destruction."

<p>To which Herbert Schiller retorts as follows in <i>Communication and

Cultural Control:</i> "The basic factor in the introduction of new technology

is obviously the quest for profitability. The 'unawareness' of the consequences

is usually [only] an indifference to the social costs – the ensuing environmental

degradation that affects society, not the producer."

<p>This is obvious. Environmental law is flouted deliberately and often

defiantly. The White House, especially when occupied by a "neo-con", routinely

appoints well known anti-conservationists to head the National Environment

Protection Agency.

<p>Take the ozone layer and hear what scientist Carl Sagan says in his<i>

Broca's Brain: Reflections on the Romance of Science:</i> "By accident

a few research groups in atmospheric photochemistry discovered that halocarbon

propellants from aerosol spray cans will reside for very long periods in

the atmosphere, circulate to the stratosphere, partially destroy the ozone

there, and let ultraviolet light from the sun leak down to the Earth's

surface. Increased skin cancer <i>for whites</i> [my italics] was the most

widely advertised consequence."&nbsp;

<p>How did halocarbon producers react? Ask Sagan: "DuPont Company, the

principal manufacturers of halocarbon propellants, for example, took the

curious position in public debates that all conclusions about halocarbons

detroying the ozonosphere were 'theoretical'.

<p>"They seemed to be implying that they would be prepared to stop halocarbon

manufacture only [after] the conclusions were tested experimentally – that

is, when the ozonosphere [has been] destroyed."

<p>You can fully test this "theory" only by attacking the ozone to the

last atom, by which time there will be no DuPont because all living things

will have been killed by ultraviolet. But profit hunters think only of

the present. They are never really interested in the future, even of their

own children.

<p>That is the point Sagan is making on cancer. It is that when ultraviolet

hits the earth full-blast, white people will be the first to go because,

in his words, "...blacks are neatly adapted to increased ultraviolet flux..."

For they contain more <i>eumelanin, </i>the stuff that darkens the skin

against ultraviolet, than Caucasians.&nbsp;

<p>But, as I say, overnight profit is what makes corporations tick. These

is no thought for posterity even where they know their present activities

mean sure future death for their own children. That is why they would rather

destroy the environment now to heighten their profits than conserve it

for others.

<p>Such utter irresponsibility – epitomised by US corporations – fills

one with trepidation. How can individuals with the biggest stake in the

world seek to push that world to the brink of extinction just to surfeit

vegetable desires?

<p>It may be redeeming that, on this issue, their political spokesman,

the US government, is voting increasingly alone in all international councils.

But how can that help the world when by far the richest and most powerful

state contumaciously refuses to co-operate?p
