They're battling over telecom legislation on Capitol Hill again.

Long distance companies and Internet service providers are fighting

with local Bell companies. Words like LATA and RBOC are being thrown

around. Your eyes glaze over and you just hope it doesn't hurt too

much once the corporate lobbyists finish their intramural battle,

even as consumers and workers seem to barely have a seat at the

table.

<P>But wait a second. For once, there seems to be a progressive

alternative vision for including everyone in the high speed Internet

world we keep being promised.</P>



<P>The immediate political debate is over a bill, H.R. 1542,

introduced late in April by House Energy and Commerce Committee Chair

Billy Tauzin to encourage the local phone companies to build the

wiring to deliver high-speed access over customer phone lines.</P>



<P>Only about 5 million Americans have so-called "broadband" access

to the Internet, some through local phone companies, others through

their cable television companies. So far, most of that access is

available only to selected urban business districts and some suburban

communities.</P>



<P>Since the 1996 Telecommunication Act, the local Bell companies

have had to give competitors access to their local phone networks,

so-called "interconnection" rules, as a requirement for themselves

entering the long distance phone market. While hardly a perfect bill,

since there have been endless disputes in the courts about what price

should be charged to competitors for access, the basic idea was to

prevent the Bells from using their existing investments in local

phone loops to leverage control of long distance.</P>



<P>The problem is that broadband wiring does not exist in many areas

yet, so the Bells have complained that the rules make any new

investments unprofitable. Without changing the rules on voice service

competition, the Tauzin bill would allow the local Bell companies to

make those data line investments without letting competitors access

those new services.</P>



<P>Some consumer groups like Consumers Union and the Consumer

Federation of America, repeating the mantra of "competition," have

condemned the Tauzin bill, but the Baby Bells do have a good case. If

every time they pay to build new infrastructure, competitors can

automatically lease use of them at some regulated "average cost"

price, the result is predictable. The competitors will cherry-pick

the most profitable customers with special deals and the local phone

companies will get stuck with the rest. Looking at that reality, the

Bells won't deploy high-speed data lines, especially in poorer or

rural areas, where they need to keep the profitable customers to

balance out poorer, less profitable ones.</P>



<P>The Tauzin bill was introduced to create the economic incentives

to deploy high-speed Internet access in poorer and rural areas. The

hitch was that while it encouraged this, it didn't mandate that the

Bells make broadband access a reality for everyone.</P>



<P>Enter Congressman Bobby Rush of Chicago and Tom Sawyer of

Ohio.</P>



<P>Pulling together a coalition of inner-city and rural

constituencies, they pushed through in committee an amendment to the

bill that mandates that the Bells achieve 100% rollout of broadband

connections, called digital subscriber lines (DSL), to all of their

central offices within five years.</P>



<P>If that sounds familiar in a nostalgic way, it's what we once

called a universal service rule. When this country decided to make

basic phone service available in every community across this country,

we didn't create a maze of regulatory rules. We just told the old

Bell System to wire a phone to every home in the country. Period. The

politicians made sure Ma Bell made a profit, but they also made sure

that not only did every home get a phone but that the rates were

affordable for rural and poor citizens.</P>



<P>The Rush-Sawyer amendment doesn't address the cost issue, but it

is a step forward from the failed policy of passing endless

regulations to create fake competition that never delivers the

promised goods. A decade ago we were told about an impending

"Information Superhighway" that would be built to every home. So far,

most of us still at best have only the dirt road of slow modem

access.</P>



<P>With the Rush-Sawyer universal access mandate, the Tauzin Bill is

the best bet we have for delivering the benefits of the cyberage to

all our citizens, not just to those who the telecom companies think

will be corporate profit centers.</P>



<P>The Tauzin bill needs to be followed by consumer rate regulation

to assure reasonable prices for consumers, but for those who might

complain about more government regulation, don't kid yourself. Wade

through the endless regulatory and court room decisions on how to

charge interconnection fees and it's obvious we are already hip-deep

in regulations -- just none that directly benefit consumers.</P>



<P>Now, this is all admittedly a confusing debate, since the

corporate players get to define most of the political choices. Some

good progressive congresspersons and activists are advocating the

opposite position from the one in this column, including (full

disclosure) my old boss at NetAction, who has been a big campaigner

against the Tauzin bill. Given some bad political options in the

past, a lot of consumer groups gave up on universal service mandates

years ago and put what I think are false hopes in the rhetoric of

competition. But the passage of the Rush-Sawyer amendment in

committee should encourage more progressives to return to demanding

universal access as a right, not a faint hope.</P>



<P>And if you need a tie-breaker in deciding on which side

progressives should be mobilizing, it's worth considering that where

the local Bell companies are all heavily union companies paying good

wages, the companies fighting the Tauzin bill are mostly non-union

with poorer wages and benefits. Actually, the comparison is even

starker. In comparison to the Tauzin bill opponents who include some

of the worst corporate union-busters, some of the Bell companies --

most notably SBC -- have signed unusually progressive agreements to

allow their currently non-union divisions, including any Internet

divisions, to automatically unionize upon a majority request of

workers without any of the harassment that most union drives face in

the corporate world.</P>



<P>When you get down to it, so-called "interconnection" rules boil

down to a government regulation that high-wage union jobs be handed

over to non-union competitors -- who can then make their money not by

being more efficient or delivering better services to consumers but

just by paying their workers less. It's just not a policy

progressives should be supporting.</P>



<P>Now, the Bells don't necessarily like the Rush-Sawyer approach of

mandating access for everyone, calling the measure "very onerous",

but it's a far better approach to disciplining the Bells than the

false promise of mandated interconnections by competitors that has

helped neither consumers nor workers in the industry.</P>



<P>Passage of the Tauzin bill and the Rush-Sawyer universal service

mandate is unlikely soon, with competing bills being pushed in the

House and in the Senate. But progressives should begin building a new

coalition of workers, consumers and technology activists to support

the amended Tauzin bill as the best hope for delivering real

broadband access to all our citizens.</P>
