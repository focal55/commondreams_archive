When the U.S. and Colombia meet on the soccer field in Miami this

Saturday, the rules are clear, the time is fixed, the game is officiated,

and one team will win. In contrast, the U.S. is playing a far different

game in Colombia: there are no rules, no referee, a maze of different

'teams,' and no clear end. The playing field is a battlefield. No one

wins; everyone loses.



<p>I have just returned from a five-day, fact-finding trip to Colombia's

southern state of Putumayo where U.S.-trained army battalions have been

deployed since December, and where thousands of acres are being sprayed

with herbicides. 



<p>The results are not good. Indigenous and peasant farmers have had their

food supply destroyed by U.S.-funded aerial spraying. A grade school

garden and a government-sponsored alternative agriculture project designed

to teach peasants to grow cash crops other than coca were destroyed by

fumigation. Paramilitary gunmen have gone on killing sprees whose total

toll will never be known. 



<p>There are some very unhappy conclusions to be drawn:



<p>First, the U.S. is teamed up with the most abusive military force in the

hemisphere. And Colombia's military, in turn, frequently works hand in

glove with brutal paramilitary forces that are estimated to be responsible

for three-quarters of the politically motivated civilian murders. Members

of the Colombian military help the paramilitaries with intelligence,

logistics and transportation, and by blocking official investigations into

their activities. This directly violates the human rights conditions set

by Congress as a prerequisite for U.S. military assistance. During the

first 18 days of January alone, paramilitary groups committed 26

massacres; in one incident paramilitary thugs beat more than 20 people to

death with sledgehammers and stones. Yet U.S. aid continues to flow.



<p>Second, there's no clear end. The $1.3 billion extraordinary aid package

passed by Congress last July was sold as a one-time emergency

appropriation, a part of "Plan Colombia" that would end the civil war and

bring peace and economic growth. Now the U.S. military is asking Congress

for an additional $1 billion a year, continuing into the foreseeable

future.



<p>Third, the strategy is unclear. While Plan Colombia was sold to the

American public as a counter-drug plan, U.S. funds were earmarked

primarily for military aid to train, equip, and transport three new

Colombian army battalions, blurring the lines between counterinsurgency

and counternarcotics missions. U.S. policymakers are desperate to appear

hard on drugs; but for Colombians this is not a war on drugs, it is the

fifth decade of a counterinsurgency struggle.



<p>Fourth, there aren't two sides: there's a maze of intertwined,

overlapping, and heavily armed competitors. The drug cartels, under the

protection of paramilitary forces, have diversified their operations,

finding new production and trafficking routes. Colombian guerrillas,

primarily the Revolutionary Armed Forces (FARC), have financed their

expansion through profits from the drug trade, but their objective is

territorial control and pursuing a war against the state. After more than

40 years, this war will not be won on the battlefield, but at the

negotiating table.



<p>Fifth, there are no winners. Ordinary Colombians lose. Human rights lose.

Peace loses. The region loses. There have already been clashes between

guerrillas and paramilitaries in surrounding countries. And the United

Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has begun preparing camps along the

border for thousands of displaced persons. The U.S. war on drugs is

pushing drug cultivation and trafficking into floundering Ecuador, Peru,

and the fragile Amazon ecosystems.



<p>The U.S. loses. Our most important interests and objectives in the

region--including strengthening democracy, promoting human rights and the

rule of law, and fostering trade and investment--are being severely

undermined. Treatment programs for addicts go underfunded at home, and,

despite spending some $19 billion a year on the war on drugs, illegal

narcotics remain cheap and plentiful within America.



<p>It's time for a new U.S. game plan in Colombia. First, we must send an

unequivocal message to the Colombian military that it must cut its ties

with paramilitary forces. Second, we must put our money into proven

programs of supporting human rights, rule of law, and economic

development. Finally, we must solve our drug problem at home with

effective medical, treatment, and educational solutions to this largely

public health problem.



<p>If the U.S. team played soccer the way we're engaging Colombia, we'd score

minus 50 goals, the team would be billions of dollars in the red, and 10

percent of the spectators would wind up dead. Maybe it's time for a new

game plan.
