IN OCTOBER, as world leaders posed for a group photo at the Asia-Pacific 

Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in Shanghai, one wondered if President Bush 

stopped to consider the backdrop: a painting of the Great Wall of China.

<P>Five centuries ago, the powerful Ming Dynasty built the 1,500-mile wall, 

that period's equivalent of the president's proposed missile defense shield.

<P>While impressive in scope even today, the Great Wall failed to prevent a 

foreign incursion that directly led to the fall of the Ming. Nomadic Mongol 

tribes, "rogue states" on the northern frontier, constantly plagued Ming 

leaders, arriving in Chinese cities, sometimes to raid but just as often 

seeking to trade.

<P>As historian Arthur Waldron has shown, some Ming leaders advocated 

increased trade to help placate the Mongols, while others called for 

aggressive military campaigns.

<P>The military option proved initially successful, but the leadership found 

it difficult to sustain political support. Gradually, Ming leaders began to 

implement a strategy used with some effectiveness in the past: spending huge 

sums to build defensive walls.

<P>While a deterrent, the Great Wall did not defend against a previously 

unforeseen threat from Manchu tribes that eventually breached it, not through 

military force, but with the aid of Chinese generals who invited them into 

their territory to help quell local rebellions.

<P>Today's nuclear-armed intercontinental ballistic missiles have transformed 

military strategy and defense. Yet, does the existence of those missiles 

change one of the lessons of the Great Wall -- the fact that the victorious 

Manchus did not directly attack the wall, but rather used diplomatic maneuvers 

and unrest within China to breach it?

<P>The terrorists that savagely attacked New York City and Washington, D.C., 

on September 11 did so by circumventing established security barriers, taking 

over domestic flights and using them as tools in their hideous attacks.

<P>If the missile defense shield is built, is it not reasonable to conclude 

that terrorists and rogue states will find ways around that shield as well?

<P>I am not suggesting that the United States abandon sophisticated military 

defense systems. Rather, instead of building the massive missile defense 

shield, it seems more prudent to take a long-term, proactive approach by 

finding ways to lessen the anti-American sentiment that fueled recent 

terrorist attacks.

<P>Waldron notes that a 15th-century Ming official concluded that the Mongols 

were a calamity for China only because they desperately needed clothing and 

food.

<P>President Bush suggested that the terrorists responsible for the September 

11 attacks were motivated by hatred for American freedom and our way of life. 

While this may be true, it is also clear that anti-American movements have 

been fueled by economic hardship in various parts of the world.

<P>With a mere fraction of the money spent on the missile defense shield, the 

United States could build more schools, water purifying plants and other 

infrastructure in Afghanistan and perhaps Palestinian areas, alleviating some 

of the desperation of the people there. Such moves would also provide greater 

regional economic stability and in turn, engender goodwill toward the United 

States.

<P>More importantly, the terrorist groups would have more difficulty 

recruiting in those areas. Economic aid is not a panacea and will not 

eliminate the ideological and religious divisions that also fuel terrorist 

activities.

<P>Yet, as the Great Wall teaches us, huge fortifications such as the missile 

defense shield have not proven effective in the long term. Should we believe 

that a wall in space would be any better?

<P>In his Sept. 6 news conference with Mexican President Vicente Fox, 

President Bush asserted that "fearful people build walls. Confident people 

tear them down."

<P>Americans should have confidence in the goodwill that our economic largesse 

can provide. More than a missile defense shield, a Great Wall of the 21st 

century, economic aid should provide a way to obviate the root factors of the 

terrorist threat that now grips our nation.
