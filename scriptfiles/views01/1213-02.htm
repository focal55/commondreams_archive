With flags flying everywhere it sometimes is

difficult to see.  Is there not a chance, then, that there are things we

have missed because of this constant waving?  With so many flags all we see

are stars, as if we're some unfortunate cartoon character who has been hit

over the head.  It seems time, like those cartoon characters, to shake our

heads vigorously from side-to-side and clear our thoughts and vision so that

we might see what is going on.

		 

<p>Amid this confusing constellation can it be that we

have missed even the most obvious and egregious things that have happen in

the wake of 11 September 2001?  Have we missed the repeal of civil

liberties-many dangerously close to, if not in fact, transgressing the

Constitution; have we missed the war profiteering of those corporations

whose campaign contributions raise suspicions about their waiting bounties

from the coming tax cuts; have we missed the naive thinking that suggests in

a world more complex than any of us can imagine either you stand with the

Bush Administration or with Usama bin Laden; could it be that we missed the

American Council of Trustees and Alumni's report that persons who have not

missed such things and who work on university campuses are accused of being

the weak link in the national character?  



<p>Not surprisingly, my name was not on the list of

those professors accused.  I wonder if it is has anything to do with the

fact I teach those books so revered by Ms. Cheney and Mr. Bennett (and not

simply that I am nobody).  I teach the so-called great books, the classics.

But just as there are many choices between Mr. Bush and Mr. bin Laden, there

are many more lessons to be learned from these books than one might be lead

to believe by conservatives.



<p>Last week I walked into the seminar room and looked

out to eager students, ready with their copies of Confucius open for that

day's investigation.  "How did Homer's Odyssey end?" I began.  "Homer?"

their faces seemed to say, "Doesn't he know that was 12 weeks ago?"  Then a

courageous hand rose, seeming both reserved and assured.  "Odysseus and

others were killing everybody in revenge, but the gods stepped in and said

they had seen enough killing and said there would be peace."  A defensible,

if not definitive, answer I thought.  These gods, as we know, little

resemble the monotheistic G-d who today is said to be taking sides, first

one and then another depending on who is speaking in his name.  From our

studies together we wondered if someone as complex as a god could settle for

the limitation of only two or three choices.



<p>We finally got to Confucius.  He would come to teach

us that one of the nine considerations exemplary persons (junzi) must make

is to pause and think about regret when they are angered.  Not an idle

exercise, we thought, while war rages in the world.



<p>Two weeks ago we read the erotic poems of Sappho who

is seldom on the conservatives' lists, though she in many ways belongs to

the series of circumstances that make other authors requisite classics on

their account. It seems Sappho has problems with Homer; even if he ends with

peace, it may well have taken him too long to arrive there in her

estimation.  In any event she writes: "Some say cavalry and others

claim/Infantry or a fleet of long oars/Is the supreme sight on the black

earth./I say it is/The one you love.  And easily proved." 



<p>We shall see if such things are easily proved, but

waving flags and swirling stars will not get this difficult task

accomplished.  And for all our uncertainty it seems clear that some things

do need to be in place if we were to succeed.  Foremost among them, perhaps,

are these: citizens free to question and read who remain protected by the

Constitution; a government divorced from the greedy will of multinational

corporations and connected instead to the will of the people seeking a

common good; and a set of options for a genuine future that are developed

through imagination, dialogue, and wisdom rather than vengeance, militarism,

and willful ignorance. 



<p>The fault, in this hour, might well be in our stars.
