The ghastly  details of the death and injured from the Tel Aviv bombing were still pouring in last night when the Islamic Jihad, a Palestinian Muslim-nationalist group claimed responsibility.

<p>Even before the exact death toll &#173; which stood at 17 by 1.20am local time &#173; was confirmed, it was clear that this was by far the worst Palestinian attack of the current intifada, and one which threatened to drive the region even closer to a frighteningly bloody local sectarian war.</p>

<p>It has always been inevitable that one of the suicide bombings, which have become an almost weekly event in Israel, would eventually claim a large number of lives. Last night, as scores of young Israelis were killed or maimed as they stood waiting to get into a beachside nightclub, that time came.</p>

<p>The question now is whether it is a large enough hiatus to get any of the players to come to their senses &#173; and whether, if they do respond, they can stop the freight train that began with a popular intifada last September and has evolved into a small, but awful, war.</p>

<p>It is no easy task. Already many of the 200,000 Israelis living in illegal settlements in the West Bank and Gaza are demanding that the army unleashes its might against the Palestinians, and are increasingly taking the law into their own hands with shootings and vigilante patrols. Already, many ordinary Palestinians are talking about a long war of attrition.</p>

<p>The Israelis will, as always, hold Yasser Arafat personally responsible for last night's horrific killings, although they know all too well that Islamic Jihad &#173; if it was indeed the culprit &#173; is a highly organised, secretive opposition Palestinian guerrilla group which he may not be in a position to rein in.</p>

<p>Mr Arafat is already trying to counter a brilliant and cynical publicity offensive by Ariel Sharon, who has successfully convinced much of the world that he has accepted the latest peace plan &#173; the US-led Mitchell report &#173; although it has rejected one of its key elements, a full freeze on settlement construction.</p>

<p>Israel has also imposed in the last week what it calls a unilateral ceasefire, although it is more accurately described as a scaling down of pro-active military assaults.</p>

<p>In the hours after the attack Israeli politicians were lining up to criticise government policy. Among them, members of the Labour Party, uneasy partners in Israel's so-called government of national unity.</p>

<p>But the essential problem is that the conflict has no resolution, at least not one in the foreseeable future. No government led by Mr Sharon will come anywhere close to what is at least formally the central demand of the Palestinians &#173; an end to the occupation of the West Bank and Gaza, in line with their reading of UN Security Council Resolution 242.</p>

<p>And the bombers striking Israel in its heartland, over the 1967 green line, are far more radical; Islamic Jihad are opposed to the state's very existence. The three-man kitchen cabinet of the Foreign Minister, Shimon Peres, Ariel Sharon and the Defence Minister, Binyanim Ben-Eliezer, is due to met this morning to decide the next step. Will they now return to the use of F-16 jets - which a fortnight ago uselessly wiped out 11 Palestinians unconnected with the bombing they were sent to avenge? Their decision was unknown late last night; but it is sure to grim. </p>
