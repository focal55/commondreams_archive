The prevailing wisdom--that America is fiercely in favor of

executions--is dead wrong. You'd never know it from the views expressed

by most political figures and media pundits, but many Americans are

uncomfortable with the notion of the state as killer, and this number

increases with every death row inmate released when new evidence

establishes his innocence. Most Americans now prefer another method to

punish the wrongdoer and protect society: life without parole.

<p>After talking with scholars, judges, prosecutors, defense attorneys,

prison officials and murder victim families, we have concluded that even

as America executes prisoners at an appallingly high rate, the death

penalty's days are numbered. The public still embraces the death penalty

in theory, but looks at it with an increasingly critical eye. That's one

reason California, for example, has had several hundred prisoners on

death row for a decade or more but has executed only a few since 1980.

<p>The past year has been a turning point, with the continuing rise in

the number of executions forcing the public, the media and religious

figures to confront the issue. Perhaps the most significant moment came

when Illinois Gov. George Ryan, a conservative Republican, halted

executions in that state, the first such moratorium in the country. It is

officials like Ryan--tough-minded but troubled about state killing--who

will bring an end to executions in this country. Ryan's move met with

little public or political opposition, a measure of how much the support

for executions has dropped. Related actions have occurred in many states,

including New Hampshire, where the House voted to abolish the death

penalty, a decision later overturned by the governor's veto.

<p>Although polls are drifting in the anti-death penalty direction,

lawmakers and candidates continue to embrace the death penalty, convinced

it would be political suicide to act otherwise. But they are increasingly

reluctant to carry on their own shoulders the moral and psychological

burden of state killing. A recent Gallup poll found support for capital

punishment at its lowest level in 19 years, down to 66% today. Support

plummets when tough alternative sentencing, such as life without parole,

is an option.

<p>Until recently, in most states, there was no such thing as true "life

without parole." Even convicted murderers often emerged from prison

eventually. The public knew this. In recent years, however, more than

two-thirds of the states, including California, have enacted procedures

for sentencing some murderers to life without parole with no chance that

they will ever get out. Many recent polls have shown that support for the

death penalty drops to about 50% when those polled were asked to choose

between execution or life without parole for convicted killers.

<p>The growing support for life without parole signals the beginning of

the end for capital punishment in our society. The number of those

opposed or ambivalent about executions will grow so large that the U.S.

Supreme Court, or dozens of state legislatures, will move against

executions.

<p>Even if opposition to the death penalty does not reach majority

levels, that doesn't mean that executions can't be outlawed in America.

Capital punishment had majority support in many Western nations, such as

France, England and Canada, at the time they abolished the death penalty,

and yet there was no widespread protest.

<p>Some of the trends that led other countries to abolition are occurring

in America, including the growing number of legislators who are speaking

against the death penalty, and outrage over the possible execution of

innocent people, especially as DNA evidence has come into play. Evolving

support for life without parole as a preferred alternative to executions

could change the way judges, lawmakers and the media respond to this

issue on every important level, especially if new cases of innocent

prisoners on death row come to light. This will foster the growing

realization that, since the justice system can never be 100% right, it

must not be allowed to administer a punishment that's 100% irreversible.

America would then join most of the modern industrial world, which has

abandoned capital punishment as a savage relic of a less enlightened age.
