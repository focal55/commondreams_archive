When the foot-and-mouth virus spread through the British countryside

this past spring-costing the nation an estimated $6 billion-conspiracy

theorists speculated that the introduction was an intentional act of

biowarfare. While this particular disease doesn't harm humans, it can

weaken livestock herds, decimate farm incomes, devastate consumer

confidence in the food supply, and bring rural economies to a standstill

with quarantines and other restrictions. 

 

<p>Secretary of Agriculture Ann Veneman recently cited her department's

success at containing food-and-mouth as proof that the U.S. government

is prepared to respond to any terrorist attacks on the food we eat. But

like so many official statements during the current round of anthrax

attacks, her optimism may be sadly misplaced



<p>Consider one particularly vulnerable link in our food chain: the modern

meat processing plant. Operating around the country, the typical plant

can process millions of pounds of ground beef or hotdogs or coldcuts in

just a few days.



<p>In comparison to a bioterrorism target like a water treatment plant,

meat processing plants have virtually no security, and their workforces

are wide open to infiltration. Many of the nation's slaughterhouses are

staffed with poorly trained and poorly paid migrant workers, often with

little documentation or background checks. The typical plant turns over

its entire staff each year, virtually guaranteeing that no one really

knows who is working there.



<p>Meatpacking is already the nation's most life-threatening occupation.

The rate of serious injury-losing a limb or an eye-is five times the

national average. In 1999, more than one out of four of America's

150,000 meatpacking workers suffered a job-related injury or illness.

The safety of the food chain is probably not the primary concern for

workers who are struggling to avoid being mauled by mechanical knives,

or ducking two-ton carcasses moving by at breakneck speed. 



<p>Yet, in many ways, these people-and the conditions at these plants-form

an unlikely first line of defense against food-borne illnesses.



<p>A terrorist could contaminate a huge amount of store-ready meat with a

strategically placed sample of a species like E. coli or salmonella or

listeria. And unlike anthrax, which is hard to obtain and prepare, these

bioweapons are readily available. 



<p>Studies in the October 18 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine

demonstrate that government regulations already fail to guarantee the

safety of our food. One study shows that one in five samples of ground

meat obtained in U.S. supermarkets carried antibiotic-resistant

salmonella. Another study found that more than half of the chickens

bought from 26 supermarkets in Georgia, Maryland, Minnesota and Oregon

carried resistant forms of the sometimes fatal germ Enterococcus

faecium.

<p>In the case of our food chain, a public health disaster is just waiting

to happen, without any terrorist threats whatsoever. Les Friedlander, a

former USDA veterinarian, suggests that someone working in a plant could

easily obtain a sample of salmonella or E. coli or some other

life-threatening agent from the plant's meat inspection lab, and use

this sample for large-scale contamination.



<p>A gradual gutting of the nation's meat inspection workforce and

authority in recent decades means that current regulations and measures

don't even catch the unintentional introductions of these contaminants.

Just in the first 9 months of 2001, the USDA announced 60 recalls,

totaling nearly 30 million pounds of meat. 



<p>Unfortunately, the vulnerability of this meat link in the food chain is

not unique. From a biowarfare perspective, the easiest targets are

genetically similar populations of organisms for whom a single bug could

easily infect the majority of individuals. Consider that 90 percent of

the nations dairy cows are closely related Holsteins. The nation's

largest pork producer, Smithfield, controls 12 million hogs who are

virtual clones of each other. The factory farms that confine tens of

thousands of animals in close and unhygienic quarters or the monoscapes

of wheat or soybeans that cover much of the Heartland resemble the

proverbial sitting duck.



<p>We don't need the Hollywood scriptwriters that the Central Intelligence

Agency retained recently to "think outside the box" on potential

terrorist threats to the food we eat. Instead, while public awareness on

matters of safety is so high, we have a perfect opportunity to clean up

the food system from within, creating more hygienic living conditions

for livestock, placing restrictions on antibiotic use in feed, and

providing more humane working conditions for slaughterhouse workers.

 

<p>In the same way that Upton Sinclair in The Jungle cast a spotlight on

the stomach-turning practices of turn of 19th century meat processing

industry, the threat of terrorism is casting a spotlight on industry

after industry, from mail delivery to air travel, exposing

vulnerabilities that were often known but never taken seriously. 



<p>In the past the public health argument for cleaning up America's food

chains has repeatedly failed to inspire politicians to support the

changes we need to protect all Americans from contaminated food. If we

are lucky, today's rallying cries for homeland security will finally

lead to meaningful actions to secure our food supplies from the threats

of both accidental and terrorist epidemics.
