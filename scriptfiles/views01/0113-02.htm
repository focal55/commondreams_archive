            BELL TEXTRON, the Rhode Island-based company that makes helicopter 

            gunships, got some good news a few months ago when Turkey awarded 

            it a $4 billion contract for 146 attack helicopters, one of the largest 

            single arms deals in history. 

            <P> 

            <P>International competition for the contract had been intense, with 

              five companies, including Boeing Aircraft and Bell Textron, submitting 

              bids. When Turkey eliminated Boeing's Apache helicopter from consideration 

              last year, Bell's King Cobra became the favorite to win the award. 

              Soon after it convenes, the new Congress will have to decide whether 

              to grant an export license for the weapons.

            <P> 

            <P>About 80 percent of the Turkish arsenal is US-made, and the Turkish 

              Army has relied on Sikorsky Blackhawks and Apache and Cobra helicopters 

              to win the long (and underreported) war with Kurdish rebels in the 

              southeast.

            <P> 

            <P>In 1997, the Clinton administration granted Boeing and Bell market 

              licenses to build the attack helicopters, brushing aside human rights 

              objections from Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch about 

              Turkey's abuse of its ethnic population.

            <P> 

            <P>Since President Clinton took office in 1992, more than $6 billion 

              in US weaponry has been delivered to Turkey. Now that Bell has won 

              the helicopter contract, the Bush administration may try to persuade 

              Congress to override human rights concerns, thus brokering the sale. 

            <P> 

            <P>American-made helicopters are well known to the Kurds. I have often 

              encountered refugees from destroyed villages in southeast Turkey 

              whose only English were the words Sikorsky and Cobra. Villagers 

              know that the soldiers who burn their houses arrive in Blackhawk 

              helicopters, which are made by the Connecticut-based Sikorsky company. 

              And they easily recognize the rocket-equipped Cobras, which are 

              manufactured at a Bell Textron plant in Texas.

            <P> 

            <P>Turkish Kurdistan is a rugged, mountainous region, and helicopters 

              have proved essential in the army's scorched-earth campaign. So 

              far, more than 3,000 Kurdish villages have been burned, depriving 

              the guerrillas of logistical support. Estimates of civilian Kurds 

              displaced by the war range from 500,000 to 2 million. It has been 

              a dirty war, and both sides have been guilty of atrocities.

            <P> 

            <P>The Kurds are a large, diverse group whose members spill across 

              the borders of Iraq, Turkey, Iran, Syria, and parts of the former 

              Soviet Union. With a population of 25 million to 30 million, they 

              represent the largest ethnic minority in the world without their 

              own state.

            <P> 

            <P>The first Kurds I met were in Iraq, where I was shooting television 

              news at the end of the Gulf War. At that time, the networks had 

              an appetite for stories of Saddam Hussein's abuses (the Iraqi dictator 

              had destroyed thousands of Kurdish villages), and I had lots of 

              work. But when I started covering the Kurdish uprising in Turkey, 

              I couldn't give the stories away. I was told that as far as the 

              media were concerned, the Turkish-Kurdish war wasn't on the radar.

            <P> 

            <P>Today, Ankara continues to dispatch US- made F-16s and Cobra attack 

              helicopters to bomb Kurdish rebels in northern Iraq, where most 

              of rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan's fighters have withdrawn. Last 

              weekend, according to Turkish newspapers, 10,000 Turkish troops 

              crossed 100 miles into Iraq, the deepest cross-border penetration 

              to date. At last report, the US-equipped troops were trying to encircle 

              2,500 Kurdish fighters dug in along the Iraq-Iran border.

            <P> 

            <P>Twelve months ago, the European Union voted to consider Turkey 

              for admission to the EU, but only on the condition that it clean 

              up its human rights record. But the EU may be having second thoughts. 

              Soon after the vote, Turkey blocked an EU delegation from visiting 

              Leyla Zana, the imprisoned Kurdish member of the Turkish Parliament 

              who has received the EU's peace prize. Then a Kurdish educational 

              foundation was indicted on criminal charges of inciting separatist 

              propaganda because it advertised a scholarship for students who 

              could read and write in Kurdish.

            <P> 

            <P>Last year the government ordered a CNN television affiliate off 

              the air for 24 hours because a reporter asked a guest if history 

              might one day regard Ocalan as a Turkish version of the South African 

              revolutionary Nelson Mandela. A few days later, Turkey arrested 

              the Kurdish mayors of three cities on vague charges of separatism. 

              There are 37 elected Kurdish mayors, and many observers had hoped 

              that their leadership would provide a nonviolent alternative to 

              the civil war in Turkey that since 1984 has taken 40,000 lives, 

              most of them Kurds.

            <P> 

            <P>Turkey has hired a stable of former leading members of Congress 

              to pave the way for licensing the King Cobras. The lobbyists include 

              former House Rules Committee chairman Gerald Solomon of New York 

              and former congressman Stephen Solarz, also of New York. Best known 

              is former House speaker-designate Bob Livingston of Louisiana, who 

              has received a $1.8 million contract to lobby for Turkey.

            <P> 

            <P>While Turkey is a valuable ally, what US exports need is gun control, 

              but that demands leadership from Washington. The sale of 146 attack 

              helicopters may be good news to Bell Textron, but human rights are 

              also in America's national interest. The new White House should 

              use its influence to hold up the $4 billion in gunships until Ankara 

              shows a willingness to deal democratically with its own citizens.

            <P>
