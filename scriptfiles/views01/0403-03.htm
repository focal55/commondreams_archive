``We will not do anything that harms our economy, because first things first are the people who live in America,'' said President George W. Bush, dismissing the international treaty aimed at slowing global warming.

<P>



   So those Nervous Nellies around the world are just going to have to understand that Americans have SUVs to fuel up and air conditioners to crank up. Just the other week, Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham forecast a ``major energy supply crisis.'' You can bet he didn't call for more windmills.

<P>



   In short order, Bush has managed to reinforce the impression that he is a captive of the fossilized thinkers in the field of energy and of the ``we did it our way'' school of international diplomacy.

<P>



   First, he reversed his campaign promise to require electric utilities to lower carbon dioxide emissions. Then, last week, he re-affirmed his opposition to the Kyoto treaty. It would require industrial countries to lower their greenhouse gas emissions by 5 to 7 percent by 2012.

<P>



   The treaty is not in America's economic interest, Bush said. His view of America's economic interest needs expanding.

<P>



   The flaw in America's energy policy is not that it has not put the American people first. It has. It has given us a standard of living envied around the world. It has also meant that with 4 percent of the world's population, the United States releases 25 percent of the world's greenhouse gases.

<P>



   So there's a reason the rest of the world is pummeling Bush for bailing out of Kyoto. Instead of turning insular, Bush should trust American innovation.

<P>



   Americans are also world leaders in creating the technology that will use energy more efficiently and cleanly, enabling growth at home and the export abroad of products that will improve the lives of millions.

<P>



   The United States need not endorse the Kyoto treaty in all its details. Obligations of developing countries remain to be negotiated; so do technical matters such as the trading of emissions credits and mitigation measures such as planting trees.

<P>



   But instead of offering an alternative, Bush has so far simply asserted the necessity of further economic development in this most developed of all countries.

<P>



   Writing in the New York Times, William K. Reilly, administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency under the first President Bush, offers guidance. 

<P>



   If Bush is skeptical of the science of global warming, he should ask the National Academy of Sciences to review it. 

<P>



   Second, Bush should ask American industry what it can do to reduce emissions. Industry is not monolithically opposed to emissions targets. ``It is little known, though quite astonishing,'' Reilly writes, ``that 11 major companies, eight of them American, have committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by a total that exceeds the reductions required of Britain under Kyoto.''

<P>



   Finally, in our view, Bush ought to drop the excuse that a predicted energy shortage requires him to throw the Kyoto treaty overboard. It is just the opposite: a reason to stress -- even require -- conservation, with the beneficial side effect of reducing greenhouse gases. 

<P>



   In the struggle to slow global warming, America should be leading the march, not dragging its feet.
