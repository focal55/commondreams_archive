It&#39;s a matter of balance," said White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer, speaking of how to weigh the deaths of two members of a missionary family against those saved by the war on drugs. But the details of the Peruvian incident, and its timing, are exposing just how unbalanced our strategies in the war on drugs have become.

<P>



What happened in Peru? The U.S. government and local officials are still debating details, but in essence, CIA employees spotted a plane carrying the Bowers family and a pilot and alerted the Peruvian military of their suspicions the flight may have been carrying drugs.

</p>

<P>



The Peruvian air force did not make radio contact with the plane before shooting it down. The Bowers family says the plane was strafed by gunfire, killing Veronica Bowers and her 7-month-old daughter. Supporters of military-style intervention credit these tactics with helping to decrease coca production by two-thirds. But supply in America remains abundant; production has simply moved to other parts of the region, including Colombia.

</p>

<P>



Just as we supported military intervention in Peru, we are pushing forward in Colombia as well. The U.S. Congress recently passed a $1.3 billion "Plan Colombia" to destroy coca farms and seize land held by guerrillas. Under Plan Colombia, we could strengthen the Colombian military&#39;s ties to right-wing militias tied to drug trafficking and massacres of civilians. Farmers also charge that anti-cocoa chemical deforestation harms family food crops as well.

</p>

<P>



Days before the Summit of the Americas began in Quebec City, a group of Latin American leaders requested that the United States rethink the military-style enterprise, which some U.S. analysts believe could plunge us into an unwinnable Vietnam-style conflict. The Latin American leaders, including Guatemalan Nobel laureate Rigoberta Menchu and former Colombian Foreign Minister Rodrigo Pardo, asked that aid to Colombia target economic development, which would undercut one leg of the drug trade.

</p>

<P>



They also noted, "We believe the United States has a legitimate interest in reducing the damage done by illegal drug use. But we are gravely concerned that current policy will cause more harm than good in Colombia and the region at large  -- while having little or no effect on the drug problems of the consumer countries."

</p>

<P>



By "consumer countries," they mean nations like the United States, whose citizens consume billions of dollars worth of cocaine. While the U.S. government is prepared to spend billions on interdiction, we consistently underfund drug treatment. Today, a record 2 million Americans are in prison, a quarter for nonviolent drug crimes. That fact alone is having a ripple effect through America&#39;s towns, families, economies, even adding to controversies over voting rights.

</p>

<P>



It must seem appealing to imagine that we can fight the drug war safely on other people&#39;s turf, far from our own streets. In addition to Plan Colombia, the Bush administration is pushing another $900 million for counter-narcotics programs in the Andes, including Peru. But there is no way to avoid America&#39;s role in supply and demand, and the human costs of fighting a militarized "war" against drugs.
