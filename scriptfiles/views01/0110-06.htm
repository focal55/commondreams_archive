I was in Washington on December 1, on that long-ago chilly morning when

eager-beaver legal observers awoke from sleeping overnight on the Supreme

Court steps. People lined up to watch oral arguments in the first round of

Bush v. Gore and talked breathlessly to NPR reporters about enduring cold

winter hours to watch "history being made."



<p>A month later, the Supreme Court's holy status has taken a beating in some

quarters. "The God that Failed" was the headline of The Nation's editorial

on the December 12 verdict. "So much for states' rights," quipped the

Washington Post's E. J. Dionne. The Rev. Jesse Jackson and AFL-CIO

President John Sweeney noted "a disturbing irony" that the court used the

14th Amendment's equal protection clause to throw out some 185,000

disproportionately African-American votes for fear that a manual vote count

might be unfair.



<p>The sense that the court broke with their judicial philosophy in a nakedly

partisan move to select George W. Bush for president fueled the fury of

Gore backers. "The Supreme Court has spent the last 50 years shaping

equal-protection jurisprudence to redress history's racial horrors," former

judge and MIT political science Professor Margaret Burnham wrote in the

Boston Globe. "However ineffectual that civil rights project was, the court

is now in vivid reverse."



<p>But this should have come as no surprise. When it comes to civil rights,

the court's gears have been stuck in reverse for a decade. Since Clarence

Thomas joined the court in 1991, the Rehnquist Five (with Justices Scalia,

Kennedy and O'Connor) have accepted challenges to the federal government's

right to enforce all sorts of laws. Specifically, they've challenged laws

that offered recourse to victims of discrimination (women, the elderly,

people with disabilities, ethnic minorities), usually coming down for

states and against the federal government. Most recently, in United States

v. Morrison, the 5-to-4 majority declared that a provision of the Violence

Against Women Act which enabled women to sue in federal court was an

overreach by Congress that "trespassed" on "states' rights."



<p>But the "states' rights" shorthand can mislead. At times the same

conservative majority has trampled all over states' rights. Most

spectacularly, they've stomped on efforts to redraw congressional districts

in a way that might increase black voting power. In 1993, in the case of

Shaw v. Reno, the North Carolina legislature, seeking to comply with the

Voting Rights Act, created two majority-black congressional districts out

of its total of 12. There had not been a black member of Congress from

North Carolina since Reconstruction, and the new apportionment resulted in

two black representatives-still less than the black proportion of the state

population. Nonetheless, when five white voters challenged the newly

created districts, the Supreme Court ruled in their favor, saying the

redistricting grouped blacks solely on the basis of race and thus bore an

"uncomfortable resemblance to political apartheid." 



<p>A similar North Carolina case went back to the court for the fourth time

this fall. "When it comes to redistricting, this Supreme Court has

repeatedly violated state prerogatives in order to protect white majorities

against perceived discrimination," says Gene Nichol, dean of the University

of North Carolina Law School.



<p>As for the 14th Amendment, Bush's lawyers have turned "equal protection" on

its head. While challenges to discrimination against minorities or women

have been greeted with utmost skepticism by the highest court, attorneys

like Ted Olson (who argued on behalf of Bush before the Supreme Court) have

perfected the art of painting civil rights remedies as discriminatory.

Olson made just that case in the 1996 Hopwood v. University of Texas School

of Law, when he represented a white plaintiff in a challenge that ended

affirmative action in Texas.



<p>On December 12, when the Supreme Court used the equal protection clause

against those whom it was meant to defend, it wasn't ironic or

incongruous-it was standard procedure. Years of ideologically driven

lawyering by right-wing firms like Olson's Center for Individual Rights

have made an upside-down reading of the 14th Amendment not the exception,

but the norm. From redistricting to affirmative action, the Supreme Court

has declared racism a thing of the past.



<p>Harvard's Lani Guinier is optimistic that the court's decision itself could

trigger reform: "The court's choice of language, explicitly valuing no

person's vote over another's, may launch a citizens' movement." It might.

Florida revealed plenty of alleged violations of the Voting Rights Act to

investigate. But while one part of this nation is stunned to discover that

the system still needs reform, another portion believes it'll always be the

same.



<p>Back in Washington on December 1, not quite a mile from the Supreme Court,

I ran into another early-morning crowd. Outside the White House, a team of

African-American workers were cutting two-by-fours and plywood to build the

inauguration platform. The stage would be finished long before we knew who

would come to stand on it, we joked.



<p>But one older worker grumbled: "Slaves built the White House; we build the

platform every four years. Won't matter to us, either way."
