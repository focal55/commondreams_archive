OF ALL the crimes against the environment that President Bush has 

committed during his brief tenure, trampling his own promise to reduce carbon 

dioxide emissions may prove to be the most damaging.

<P>Global climate change threatens our economy, national security and the 

physical landscape itself. By denying the urgency of global warming, President 

Bush will not make it go away. That is why Bush cannot abandon the Kyoto 

Protocol, which calls for industrialized nations to take the lead in reducing 

greenhouse gas emissions.

<P>The National Academy of Sciences recently revisited the issue of global 

warming at Bush's request. The report concluded that "greenhouse gases are 

accumulating in Earth's atmosphere as a result of human activities . . . 

Temperatures are, in fact, rising."

<P>The report further stated that "national policy decisions made now and in 

the longer-term future will influence the extent of any damage suffered by 

vulnerable human populations and ecosystems later in this century."

<P>As a presidential candidate, George Bush recognized the importance of this 

issue, promising to require all power plants to meet standards for reducing 

carbon dioxide "within a reasonable period of time." He proudly announced that 

"in Texas, we've done better with mandatory reductions, and I believe the 

nation can do better."

<P>As president, however, Bush now advocates voluntary reductions, and has 

declared the Kyoto Protocol to be dead on arrival.

<P>Bush has insisted that it would be too expensive for the United States to 

follow the Kyoto treaty, which would require the nation to reduce its emission 

levels to 7 percent below 1990 levels by 2012.

<P>Yet, the long-range environmental and economic consequences of abandoning 

the treaty will be far greater than the short-term expenses of adhering to it.

<P>Many members of the business community recognize the stark realities of 

global warming. In 1998, at the World Economic Forum, the chief executive 

officers of the world's 1,000 largest corporations, declared that global 

climate change was the most critical problem facing humanity.

<P>In addition, recent studies indicate that shifting to more efficient 

technologies and renewable energy sources will create hundreds of thousands of 

jobs for Americans, and that the United States' Gross Domestic Product will 

actually increase.

<P>There is also a role for "sinks," such as forest lands that can sequester 

or reduce carbon dioxide levels. There is room for all of these approaches in 

the ongoing Kyoto process because the sequential goals provide such 

flexibility.

<P>We do not have the luxury of endless time. Nor are voluntary reductions, 

such as the president has argued, sufficient.

<P>In 1992, the United States signed and ratified a treaty that committed the 

world's industrialized countries to voluntarily reduce emissions of greenhouse 

gases to 1990-levels by 2000. It failed. Not one country has lived up to its 

voluntary commitments, and U.S. emissions continue to rise.

<P>Abandoning Kyoto carries serious geopolitical repercussions as well. Per 

capita energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions are twice as high in 

the United States as in Europe, and the disparities grow even wider when 

comparing the United States with developing countries.

<P>British Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott recently stated that the United 

States "cannot pollute the world while free-riding on action by everyone else."

<P>European Commission President Romano Prodi added that "if one wants to be a 

world leader, one must know how to look after the entire Earth and not only 

American industry."

<P>Quite simply, global climate change is under way, and it poses real threats 

to our national and indeed global well-being.

<P>The Kyoto Protocol is the best tool we have to try to avert this potential 

economic and environmental catastrophe.
