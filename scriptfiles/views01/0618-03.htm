Just a month after the news broke of former Senator Bob Kerrey's alleged war crime in Vietnam, Americans and their media celebrated Memorial Day -- the day to remember U.S. war dead -- numbed by a movie version of Pearl Harbor designed to stimulate amnesia instead of reflection.

<P>My perusal of the New York press turned up not even a passing mention of the controversy -- so recently boiling hot -- surrounding Mr. Kerrey's role in the deaths of more than a dozen civilians in a tiny village in February, 1969. Memorial Day is supposed to be about remembrance -- not only of U.S. citizens killed in war but also the wars that got them killed -- so it was strange to find Vietnam's nihilistic carnage generally granted the same patriotic status as the fight against Hitler's Germany, Hirohito's Japan and Mussolini's Italy. The message seemed to be: All wars (including Vietnam) are enobling, especially if you died in one.</P>

<P>Such lack of proportion stems partly from the deep-rooted desire to elevate battle death above ordinary death, so that the soldier felled by sniper fire in the rice paddies of the Mekong Delta must be accorded honor equivalent to the soldier who died from German artillery at the Battle of the Bulge or a Confederate bullet at Antietam. Some men imagine that it's more heroic to die in an epic battle like the Trojan War -- or as a member of Ben Affleck's unit -- than in bed, because dying in bed seems to them all prose and no poetry.</P>

<P>At best such a romantic vision of war is childish nonsense -- the terminal cancer patient's slow death can produce greater art (and acts of courage) than the soldier's sudden one. At worst it plays into the hands of propagandists and cynics too eager in any era to dispatch young men to an early grave.</P>

<P>Hollywood and the military delight in this national blindness toward war. Jerry Bruckheimer released his film of the great Japanese &#34;sneak attack&#34; at the end of May because he knows that Memorial Day evokes cheap sentimentality more than genuine sadness. Sentiment sells tickets and drums up naive recruits; sadness makes you want to stay home and cling to your loved ones. &#34;Romance! Heroism! Stuff Blowing Up!&#34; blared <I>Entertainment Weekly </I>in celebration of movieland's version of Japan's assault on the Pacific Fleet. </P>

<P>How much easier it is to contemplate &#34;a date which will live in infamy&#34; than to think about the infamy of Kerrey's raiders.</P>

<P>I don't begrudge the public pain of the wounded Second World War veteran who vented his cover-story anguish about his 19-year-old son -- killed two months before Mr. Kerrey's shoot-up at Thanh Phong -- in the mass circulation <I>Parade </I>magazine. For me it would likely be unbearable. But it's unbearable in another sense when 74-year-old Troy Liverman describes his reaction to antiwar demonstrators who, in the summer of 1969, read aloud the names of dead U.S. servicemen a mile from his son Johnny's grave in Arlington National Cemetery. Mr. Liverman counterdemonstrated, carrying a sign that denounced the protesters as &#34;parasites&#34;: &#34;They had a right to protest, but they had no right to use Johnny's name to undermine his cause. My son was not a victim. He died serving his country.&#34;</P>

<P>I beg to differ. Johnny Liverman was most certainly a victim; he died serving the grotesque ambitions and vanity of president Lyndon Johnson, a would-be tyrant of profound dishonesty and arrogance. Mr. Johnson lied his way through Vietnam with a callous indifference to the raw youths who did his bidding -- and the countless Vietnamese they killed. Mr. Liverman disdains Bill Clinton's Vietnam draft dodging. But what of Mr. Johnson's own trumped-up military service -- his calculated fabrication of a combat record designed to advance his political career?</P>

<P>By the time Mr. Kerrey's squad arrived in Vietnam, no one but the lunatic fringe of the U.S. military and political establishment thought the war could be &#34;won&#34; in conventional terms. For any American able to read a newspaper or watch television, the Tet offensive one year earlier had disabused them of any notions of garnering glory from fighting &#34;communism&#34; in a distant Asian land.</P>

<P>But U.S. soldiers kept coming -- draftees and volunteers alike -- and they kept dying as Mr. Nixon and his henchman, Henry Kissinger, criminally prolonged a war they had already conceded to an ill-chosen enemy -- left-wing nationalists determined to rid their country of another in a long line of foreign invaders.</P>

<P>The question becomes not whether Vietnam was worth fighting -- it was not -- but why intelligent young officers like Mr. Kerrey were deluded enough to follow Nixon's orders unto their everlasting shame. Mr. Kerrey now says he carries the strain of guilt about ordering the raking fire of the hamlet -- in response to what he thought was enemy fire -- that resulted in the deaths of women and children. Putting aside Gerhard Klann's altogether convincing and much uglier version of what happened that night (and Mr. Kerrey's weak denial), we also need to ask why Mr. Kerrey and his colleagues were there in the first place.</P>

<P>The answer to the second question is more political than personal. Mr. Kerrey was in Kien Hoa province because Mr. Nixon and Mr. Kissinger wanted him to help implement a policy of terrorizing the Vietnamese civilian population into non-collaboration with the communist insurgents in the south. The White House hoped that the Viet Cong's ally, the North Vietnamese government, might then sue for peace on more favorable face-saving terms. The result was the CIA's assassination campaign known as the Phoenix program and the military's Operation Speedy Express. Speedy Express's crazy premise -- that all civilians (regardless of age or sex) in Kien Hoa were members or supporters of the National Liberation Front -- meant that none of the usual distinctions needed to be made between combatants and noncombatants.</P>

<P>Mr. Kerrey described the policy succinctly when asked by Dan Rather of <I>60 Minutes II </I>why his after-action report asserted that his squad killed 14 Viet Cong: &#34;We would not have separated out and mentioned them as women and children. We just didn't -- sex, age, nothing would have been reported in that fashion. We considered everyone in that area to be VC. And that's how we would report it.&#34;</P>

<P>The inability, or the unwillingness, to make such distinctions is what made this Memorial Day so dispiriting. We Americans are always innocent victims of alien perfidy; we always mean well, so what do civilian deaths matter, as long as Mr. Affleck and Mr. Kerrey demonstrate sufficient sensitivity and anguish? Mr. Kerrey maintained his innocence for 32 years through silence, carefully constructing an image that allowed him to have his cake and eat it: the decorated veteran who realized too late that the war was wrong.</P>

<P>Now revealed as a perpetrator, rather than a victim, Mr. Kerrey's only real defense is that he was just following orders. After Nuremberg, this argument is untenable. After My Lai, where two GIs intervened to rescue civilians from the murderous American fusillade, it's enough to make you weep. Which is what we might consider doing next year on behalf of all our civilian victims in Vietnam.
