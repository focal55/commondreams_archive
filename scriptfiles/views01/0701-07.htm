Microsoft's future could ride on a decision that's likely to have as 

much to do with politics as with anti-trust law. And with politics comes money.

<P>In recent years, the software giant has showered millions of dollars on 

politicians of both major parties, lawmakers who now will decide whether to 

take a stand on one of the nation's biggest anti-trust suits.

<P>Overall, Microsoft and its employees were the country's fifth-largest 

political donor in the 2000 election -- contributing $4.7 million to 

politicians and their committees. Republicans received about 53 percent of 

that money.

<P>For Microsoft, the stakes are huge. The U.S. Court of Appeal's decision 

Thursday to toss out a lower court's plan to split the high-tech firm into two 

separate entities was another step in a long legal battle. Now Justice 

Department attorneys must decide whether to appeal the decision to the Supreme 

Court, retry the penalty phase in a lower court or settle the case.

<P>The company's wide financial reach makes it easier for politicians to duck 

and wait for the heat to pass on the issue, even those expected to take a 

position.

<P>Republican House Speaker Dennis Hastert and his Democratic counterpart, 

Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, who are not known for agreeing on issues, made 

similar statements in the wake of Thursday's ruling.

<P>"Let's hope that we can put this lawsuit behind us," Hastert said.

<P>For Gephardt, the ruling hopefully "will cause the parties, and the court, 

to go back and see if they can come up with an appropriate, sensible agreement.

"

<P>Both Hastert and Gephardt list Microsoft as a campaign contributor. 

According to Federal Election Commission records, Gephardt received $2,500 in 

2000 and another $5,000 this year. Hastert received $2,500 last year and an 

additional $1,000 this year, FEC records show.

<P>And in a joint statement, Sen. Mike DeWine, an Ohio Republican who received 

$9,000 in campaign contributions from Microsoft last year, and Democratic. Sen.

<P>Herb Kohl of Wisconsin said they "will continue to monitor future 

developments in the case closely, but feel strongly that the case must remain 

above politics." The two are the ranking members of the Senate's anti-trust 

subcommittee.

<P>Microsoft didn't always seek support in Washington. For years, the software 

giant prided itself on steering clear of national politics and lobbying. But 

when their legal troubles started, that attitude quickly changed.

<P>"Microsoft, before their anti-trust case, had almost no presence in 

Washington," Arizona Sen. John McCain told The Chronicle editorial board 

earlier this year. "Now, I almost don't know a lobbyist who's not on their 

payroll."

<P>During the last election campaign, Microsoft employees gave more than $50,

000 to the Bush campaign, while the company and its workers gave $500,000 in 

unlimited, soft money donations to the Republican National Committee for use 

in Bush's battle against Democrat Al Gore. Gore did not receive any money from 

Microsoft, according to election commission records.

<P>According to data supplied by the Center for Responsive Politics, Microsoft 

employees also donated $22,500 to Bush's recount effort, and a Microsoft 

executive gave $100,000 to the Bush-Cheney Inauguration Committee.

<P>Ideology has little to do with where Microsoft spreads its money. In the 

2000 election cycle, the company donated to 247 House campaigns and 61 Senate 

candidates. House Republicans received $326,000 while Democrats took in $262,

000.

<P>"Companies that are really toeing the 50-50 party split on donations are 

basically pragmatic," said Sheila Krumholz, research director for the Center 

for Responsive Politics, a nonprofit group that monitors political 

contributions. "They court all sides."

<P>Rep. Nancy Pelosi, a liberal Democrat from San Francisco, received $1,000, 

the same as conservative Republican Rep. Dan Burton of Indiana. Liberal 

Democratic Rep. Charles Rangel of New York took in $4,000 from Microsoft, 

while conservative Republican Rep. Dick Armey of Texas received $5,000.

<P>It was the same story in the Senate, where Democrats Dianne Feinstein of 

California received $8,000 from Microsoft and Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts 

received $6,000. On the Republican side, Microsoft gave Trent Lott of 

Mississippi $5,000 and Missouri's John Ashcroft received $9,000.

<P>Ashcroft, who lost his bid for the Senate, has since become attorney 

general, the man in charge of the Justice Department and its handling of the 

Microsoft case.

<P>President Bush is waiting to hear from Justice before making any public 

statements on the future of the case. But White House spokesman Ari Fleischer 

hinted that the president wouldn't mind seeing a settlement, a position that 

would match that of Microsoft founder Bill Gates.

<P>"The president believes that people should work hard to enter into 

agreements," Fleischer said Thursday. "And the president believes that there's 

too much litigation in our society, generally speaking."
