The Bush White House is not the first to believe that what's good

for General Motors is good for the U.S.A., but it is the first to make a

chief lobbyist for the Big Three, Andrew Card, White House chief of

staff. It's also the first to have an oil tanker named after its national

security advisor (Condoleezza Rice used to sit on the board of Chevron).

Now that the Bush Cabinet is also loaded with anti-environmental

stalwarts and oil patch vets like Gale Norton, Ann Veneman, Spencer

Abraham and Don Evans, the administration has begun talking about taking

a more reasonable and balanced approach to the environment. Don't be

fooled.

<p>When it comes to all things green, the Bush folks seem to have learned

their lesson from the outspoken Gingrich revolution of the mid-1990s that

failed to gut America's keystone environmental laws. The former Texas

governor's intent appears the same, to favor extractive industries like

oil and timber over wilderness protection, and replace government

enforcement with self-regulation by corporate polluters. Any doubts on

that score have been settled by Bush's turnaround on a campaign pledge to

reduce greenhouse CO2 emissions from coal-fired power plants. Did he say

"no new gases"?

<p>However, no matter how bad the policies, they are all to be done in

the name of balance. Norton, for example, has balanced photographs of

national parks in the Department of Interior's hallways with new

photographs of western mining operations and an offshore oil platform.

And the president's primary environmental pledge--to increase funding for

the national parks--is earmarked not for wildlife science and protection

but building and road repair.

<p>The rhetoric of moderation reflects one fundamental but precarious

fact. For the first time since the Eisenhower administration, the

Republican Party controls not only both chambers of Congress but also the

White House. They are led by a president who, unlike his father, fully

buys into the argument that environmental protection is bad for the

economy (at least the fossil fuel economy of Enron, Koch Industries and

Halliburton). Bush's budget does provide more than $1 billion for

research into solar, wind and other clean energy sources, but only if the

revenue can be generated from exploratory oil drilling in the Arctic

National Wildlife Refuge. By this logic he might also decide to fund the

war on drugs by placing a user tax on cocaine and heroin.

<p>Yet, for all their oil patch connections, the people around George W.

are understandably fearful of being perceived as anti-green at a time

when 80% of Americans still identify themselves as environmentalists. So

what appears to be emerging is a plan to do industry's dirty work not in

the open but through covert legislation and managerial fiat, with the

rhetorical bombast turned down low. Even Utah Republican James Hansen,

the head of the House Resources Committee who wants to increase public

lands mining and open national parks to snowmobiles, jet skis,

helicopters and airplanes, tells reporters he'd like to do this "in a

reasonable, moderate, well-thought-out way."

<p>Bill Clinton during his tenure as president vetoed between 70 and 75

anti-environmental riders, so-called stealth riders added to general

spending bills. But if administration-driven amendments win a majority in

today's House and Senate, they will undoubtedly be signed into law by

Bush. With regulated industries and trade associations like the Edison

Electric Institute also vetting new appointments to the EPA and other

resource agencies, environmental law enforcement during the Bush years

could prove about as fierce the California gnatcatcher.

<p>Green groups such as the Sierra Club and a newly revitalized

Greenpeace are looking to work with bipartisan coalitions of both

Democrats anxious to reclaim power in the next election cycle and

moderate Eastern Republicans who see the anti-environmental phobias of

their Western colleagues as a threat to their party's staying power. The

real challenge, however, will be if the enviros can get beyond a few

high-profile battles like the fight over the Arctic National Wildlife

Refuge. What these coalitions need to do is engage the public's interest

in the trench warfare that will be taking place in Capitol Hill budget

hearings and the corridors of countless government agencies and offices

that are supposed to be protecting America's natural health and beauty.
