BOSTON <wbr>--<wbr> Despite scant coverage in the U.S. media, a controversy over

depleted-uranium ammunition used in the Gulf and Balkan wars has been

raging in Europe. Several governments that provided troops for these

conflicts fear that a rash of unexplained illnesses in

veterans--including hemorrhaging, tumors and cancers--may have been

caused by ammunition fired by U.S. warplanes.

<p>Germany, Italy, Norway and the European Parliament have called for a

moratorium on using the ammunition, while the World Health Organization

has announced plans for a study of civilians in Kosovo and Iraq who may

have been exposed. Last week, Pekka Haavisto, the head of the United

Nations' investigation of depleted uranium, warned of the necessity to

"closely follow the state of health" of those exposed to the ammunition

in the Balkans.

<p>Questions abound: Is there a causal link between depleted uranium and

serious illnesses? What constitutes dangerous levels of exposure? How

many soldiers and civilians have been exposed? How much plutonium is

there in the ammunition?

<p>One thing is certain: The Pentagon has inflamed the controversy by

withholding information and stonewalling investigations. It is likely to

remain a major headache for the Bush administration, especially for

Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld.

<p>Depleted uranium is a chemically toxic heavy metal that emits

low-level alpha radiation. It is used in armor-piercing ammunition

because it is extremely dense and pyrophoric, which enables it to punch

and burn its way through hard targets such as tanks. But depleted uranium

also contaminates the impact area with a fine depleted-uranium dust that

presents a health hazard if inhaled in sufficient quantities. In the

aftermath of the Gulf War, research on rats conducted by the military's

Armed Forces Radiobiology Research Institute found that depleted

uranium's chemical toxicity--not its radioactivity--may cause immune

system damage and central nervous system problems and may contribute to

the development of certain cancers.

<p>Dr. David McClain, the military's top depleted-uranium researcher,

told a presidential committee investigating Gulf War illnesses in 1999

that "strong evidence exists to support [a] detailed study of potential

DU carcinogenicity." A separate Army-funded study conducted by the

Lovelace Respiratory Research Institute in Albuquerque, N.M., found that

depleted uranium caused cancer when implanted in laboratory animals.

While Fletcher Hahn, a senior scientist at Lovelace, cautioned about

applying the findings to human beings, he also called the study "a

warning flag that says we shouldn't ignore this."

<p>Despite the military's own research, however, in recent weeks Pentagon

spokesmen have dismissed concerns about depleted uranium as unscientific

hysteria and propaganda. For example, Army Col. Eric Daxon recently

attributed concerns about depleted uranium to "a purposeful

disinformation campaign" by the Iraqi government. Yet, the Army

anticipated the current controversy even before the war against Iraq. A

July 1990 report from the U.S. Army Armament, Munitions and Chemical

Command predicted that, "Following combat, the condition of the

battlefield and the long-term health risks to natives and combat veterans

may become issues in the acceptability of the continued use of DU

[ammunition] for military applications." The report added that depleted

uranium is "linked to cancer when exposures are internal."

<p>Six months after the Army's prescient report, U.S. and coalition

fighting forces charged into Kuwait and Iraq, oblivious to the hazards of

the 320 tons of depleted-uranium ammunition shot by U.S. tanks and

aircraft. When thousands of veterans reported myriad health problems

after the war, a series of federal investigations queried the Defense

Department about its use of depleted uranium. In each case, the Army

Surgeon General's office asserted that only 35 veterans had been exposed,

a number so small that it did not justify further research.

<p>Through Congressional inquiry and the determined work of Gulf War

veterans' advocates, however, the Pentagon was forced to dramatically

increase its estimates of the number of veterans exposed to depleted

uranium.

<p>In January 1998, the Pentagon's Office of the Special Assistant for

Gulf War Illnesses made a long-overdue admission: "Combat troops or those

carrying out support functions generally did not know that DU

contaminated equipment such as enemy vehicles struck by DU rounds

required special handling. The failure to properly disseminate such

information to troops at all levels may have resulted in thousands of

unnecessary exposures."

<p>The Pentagon's figure of "thousands" tells us little about the effects

of depleted uranium on these veterans. Unfortunately, until 1998 the

Department of Veterans Affairs accepted the Pentagon's original number

and examined only 33 veterans exposed to depleted uranium. Some of these

veterans continued to excrete depleted uranium in their semen and urine

six years after the war. Several have mild central nervous system

problems. The VA removed a bone tumor from one veteran who was wounded by

DU shrapnel.

<p>In the absence of an epidemiological study of a larger number of

exposed veterans, however, no firm conclusions about the role of depleted

uranium can be drawn. Unfortunately, the lack of candor has continued

even after Kosovo. When the war ended, a United Nations task force asked

NATO to identify areas contaminated with depleted uranium so that

peacekeepers, civilians and relief workers might be warned about the

potential hazard. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization inexplicably

refused to comply with the request. In February 2000, eight months after

the war, NATO finally confirmed that U.S. jets had released the

equivalent of 10 tons of depleted uranium in Kosovo and Serbia. Another

seven months passed before NATO disclosed the 112 locations of

contamination. But it wasn't until last month--19 months after the

bombing stopped--that NATO finally posted warning signs at the sites.

<p>From all accounts, peacekeepers, civilians and relief workers in

Kosovo were surprised to learn about depleted-uranium contamination in

their midst. There, as in Iraq, children had long been playing on

destroyed equipment. In addition, adults had scavenged destroyed

equipment for usable parts and scrap metal.

<p>European outrage increased when the U.N. disclosed that some

depleted-uranium ammunition used in Kosovo contains plutonium and other

highly radioactive elements. Pentagon spokesmen asserted that the amounts

of plutonium in the ammunition are extremely low, but they have failed to

publicly disclose the levels of plutonium in ammunition shot in Kosovo,

Bosnia, Iraq and Kuwait and on training ranges in Japan, Germany, Puerto

Rico and the United States.

<p>The Pentagon's history of withholding information about depleted

uranium has fueled suspicions among many of our allies. Rumsfeld should

try a new approach: ordering full disclosure of all information and

complete cooperation with international investigations.
