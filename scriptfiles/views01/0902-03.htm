FOR SIX DECADES, Democrats have been proud defenders of America's most popular government program, Social Security. But the debate is now becoming so muddled that when the dust settles, Social Security may well end up partly privatized with George W. Bush getting credit for saving it.  How could this have happened?
<P>

<p>Twenty years ago it became clear that Social Security needed adjustments because people were living longer. Unlike a   private retirement account, Social Security keeps sending the checks as long as you live.
<P>



<p>In 1983, Congress slightly raised both taxes and the retirement age. It also adjusted the cost-of-living formula. These changes deliberately cause Social Security to take in more money than it pays out through about 2013. This was done to bank reserves so the system could keep paying full benefits when the baby boom generation retires. Then the  system will need to tap those reserves. These modifications will  keep the system solvent until the 2030s.
<P>



<p>What then? There are only four choices. Trim benefits, either directly or by postponing the retirement age; raise taxes; hope for higher economic growth; or invest Social Security reserves in a way that increases income.
<P>



<p>Conservatives are using Social Security's need for more  money 35 years hence to argue for partial privatization now. Supposedly, by putting some of the payroll tax receipts that finance Social Security into personal retirement accounts, rates of return will be higher. Then Social Security checks could be significantly cut, but retirees could make up the difference from private accounts.
<P>



<p>But this plan spends the same money twice. Payroll tax revenues now coming into the system finance Social Security   checks for current retirees. Unless we stop paying those checks, diverting payroll taxes to new private accounts would cost the government an extra trillion dollars. It would make Social  Security's solvency worse. 
<P>



<p>Private accounts also leave individual retirees vulnerable to the ups and downs of the stock market and to bad personal investment decisions. And unlike conventional Social Security,  which pays benefits as long as you live, private accounts can run out.
<P>



<p>The Bush approach is so bad that opposing it should be a political slam dunk for Democrats. But no. For one thing, a few high-profile Democrats are willing to experiment with private accounts. Former New York Senator Patrick Moynihan  has happily and publicly given President Bush bipartisan cover.   For another, Candidate Al Gore got obsessed with what he called the lockbox (Here you really need to stay awake, and not just because it's Gore.). 
<P>



<p>Gore's idea was that the current annual surpluses coming into the Social Security accounts should be used to pay  down the national debt. Then, when Social Security started   needing more money in a couple of decades, government could   borrow back the money to pay Social Security checks.
<P>



<p>Politically, Gore's strategists thought that by putting the  Social Security reserves off budget and forcing George W.  Bush to take the lockbox pledge, they would make it impossible for Bush to eat into the surplus with a large tax cut.
<P>



<p>You can see how well that tactic worked.  Worse, Gore's actual scheme was not a lockbox at all but an accounting gimmick. If the idea was to segregate Social  Security surplus funds and invest them separately, that could   have been done. But that's not what Gore offered.
<P>



<p>Wall Street   gets nervous about large government reserves being invested in  securities. So instead, Gore proposed using Social Security surpluses to retire government debt and just calling it a lockbox.
<P>



<p>In any case, when Bush's tax cut proved much too big,  Democrats could only rail that he was threatening Social  Security. But just enough Democrats had voted for the tax cut   that they shared the blame; the Republicans could insist,  correctly, that there was never any lockbox. And nobody understood what a lockbox was, anyway. Thus, Bush's overreach yielded only meager benefit for Democrats.
<P>



<p>So - how to save Social Security, politically and substantively? One straightforward idea voters would grasp:  Repeal the tax cut, reclaim the surplus, and earmark some of it for the Social Security reserves. A portion of those reserves could be invested by the Social Security trustees in blue chip stocks and bonds, and income would compound for 35 years.
<P>



<p>That would increase the system's rate of return and income but without leaving any individual vulnerable. The privatizers are playing for keeps. Social Security's champions need something better than a pretend lockbox.
