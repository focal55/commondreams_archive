FOR MOST AMERICANS, news of the failed  Pakistan-India Summit talks may be ''interesting,'' but of little consequence. Indeed, we will likely take comfort in knowing that the four-decades-long nuclear confrontation between Moscow and Washington resulted in mutual deterrence. We may find this a comforting paradigm for South Asia today: Nuclear war is as unlikely there as it was  during the Cold War nuclear stalemate. But nothing could be further  from the truth.

<P>



<p>Any number of potential issues could provide the spark leading to nuclear war between Pakistan and India - issues that never existed between the United States and the  now-defunct Soviet Union.

<P>







<p>First, throughout the post-war era, with the buildup of nuclear arsenals and ever-more sophisticated delivery systems on both sides, no American troops ever engaged in battle with Soviet troops. 

<P>







<p>Pakistan and India have fought three  bitter wars since the two states  were created in 1947, and skirmishes and artillery exchanges  continue to kill soldiers on either side of the line of demarcation  near the Siachen Glacier. For  many in both societies, another unforgiven remembrance of things past includes India's treatment of 90,000 Pakistani  POWs, the brutality of the fighting, and the merciless rape and  slaughter of noncombatants by  both sides, especially in the final  weeks of the 1970-71 Bangladesh secessionist war, when India intervened on the side of Bangladesh. 

<P>







<p>Second, despite arsenals that grew to as many as 30,000 nuclear warheads on both sides from 1950 to 1990, Moscow and Washington had no outstanding territorial disputes. 

<P>







<p>Islamabad and New Delhi have two of immediate importance. The predominantly Muslim and hotly disputed ''Indian State'' of Kashmir, along Pakistan's eastern border, could provide the biggest spark of all. Last year, insurgent Pakistani forces fighting  inside Indian-controlled territory  brought the two states to the brink of war. The Siachen boundary issue could also spark war. 

<P>







<p>In interviews with top generals and at the Strategic Institutes in the early  1990s, both sides referred to the ''strategic'' Siachen Glacier, thus underscoring the emotional content in  the rivalry, and the fuzzy thinking that often clouds their bilateral  disputes. When pressed, these  generals and think tank experts conceded that the daily, hot-war artillery exchanges in one of  the highest mountain regions of  the world could not, by definition, be ''strategic'': It is simply not possible to build up, then launch a major military  offensive where geography prohibits creation of a huge staging  area for men or war machines.  Cold-eyed analysis such as this, by senior officers or in the two strategic institutes (heavily populated  by retired generals), is desperately needed and virtually nonexistent. 

<P>







<p>During the Cold War, the two  superpowers worked to guarantee that mutual assured deterrence  was imbedded in ''mutual assured destruction.'' India and Pakistan have warheads, aircraft, and missiles sufficient to assure the deaths of tens of millions on both sides. 

<P>







<p>Moscow and Washington had clearly articulated, mutually understood  doctrines, spelling out conditions under which nuclear weapons  might be used. Warning signs  were thus posted to prevent actions, activities, and miscalculations that spark war. Moreover,  both sides developed highly sophisticated systems to maintain  tight control over the handling  and - in worst case scenario - launch of such weapons. The full package, command, control computers,  communication, and intelligence -  referred to as ''C-cubed-I'' - was more expensive and extensive than the weapon systems. 

<P>







<p>Pakistan and India have only  the most rudimentary of strategic doctrines, and despite assurances that these are now in place, they  remain unclear and unwieldy.  Measures designed to command  and control handling and release  of nuclear weapons are rudimentary at best. The C-cubed-I ''package'' must be as invulnerable and  sure-fire as the arsenals, but every aspect of C-cubed-I is vulnerable  in South Asia. 

<P>







<p>Other potential sparks could  also light the South Asian nuclear powder keg: Roughly as many  Muslims live in India as in Pakistan, a country of about 140 million. Sectarian violence, religious  clashes, and perceptions that the  Hindu majority is persecuting its  Muslim citizens  are recurring problems which, on any day, at any time, can cause violence and  death. Mobs then take to the  streets, demanding political and  military action by political leaders. None of these emotional historical factors was present in the ideological, geostrategic superpower rivalry. 

<P>







<p>Finally, faith in the system or fear of the secret police meant American and Soviet citizens  tended to eschew mob action or  armed conflict to resolve internal political disputes. India holds regular elections. Pakistan opts for  bloodless military coups. But political leaders are vulnerable to  violent domestic political segments that limit diplomatic maneuverability.

<P>







<p>Thus, the failed summit talks  deserve our grave concern: Since 1991, State Department experts have labeled South Asia the likeliest place for nuclear war.  Nothing from the recent summit  changes that estimate.
