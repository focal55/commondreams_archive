President Bush's upward spike of popularity owes a lot to his 

presence on television -- a medium that has not always been so kind. At 

times, under pressure, he has earned many comparisons to a deer in 

headlights. But after a wobbly performance on Sept. 11, Bush got into a 

groove of seizing the TV opportunity and making the most of it.



<p>Today's television environment is, more than ever, warmly 

hospitable to simple -- and simplistic -- declarative statements. That's 

just as well for Bush, who has shown a distinct tendency to get entangled 

in a morass of fragmentary linguistic riffs. Last year, on many occasions, 

he seemed painfully anxious to make his way to the end of sentences without 

further embarrassment. But now, for the most part, it's a very different story.



<p>For insights about recent shifts of George W. Bush's persona on 

television, I contacted media critic Mark Crispin Miller, whose 1988 book 

"Boxed In: The Culture of TV" was a groundbreaking analysis of the tube. In 

the book, he disputed the customary image of the U.S. president as a 

"mighty individual" -- and identified that image as "a corporate fiction, 

the careful work of committees and think tanks, repeatedly reprocessed by 

the television industry for daily distribution to a mass audience."



<p>Boosted by family ties and powerful corporate backers, Bush won 

the presidency (though not the popular vote) while projecting an affable 

personality that some have found endearing. But even while carrying out 

weighty duties of the presidency with all its trappings, he struck many 

Americans as a lightweight, ill-suited for the job. A turning point came 

with his dramatic speech to a joint session of Congress in mid-September.



<p>The rave media reaction "was understandable," Miller told me, 

"because it actually reflected less on Bush's speech per se than on the 

moment's strange and terrifying context. The speech was deemed 

'Churchillian' because the audience (the American people, the Congress, the 

media) was so desperate for a proper leader at that fearful moment. At that 

moment of catastrophe, there was so fierce a hunger for a national 

father-figure that the audience saw one in the president, who therefore 

came across like Churchill, or like FDR, despite his lack of stature -- 

which, prior to the shock, had been quite clear to most observers."



<p>Miller's book "The Bush Dyslexicon: Observations on a National 

Disorder," published a few months ago, warns against assuming too much 

about the significance of Bush's habitual tongue-tangles. It's a cautionary 

note that now rings especially true. The man in the White House is shrewd 

and capable of high-impact rhetorical feats.



<p>Since Sept. 11, Miller says, President Bush "has continued, by and 

large, to speak with more authority than usual." While acknowledging that 

Bush "has at times reverted to his usual gaffery" (as in his announcement 

that "ticket counters and airplanes will be flying out of National 

Airport"), Miller observes that "on the subject of 'America's new war' -- 

'the focus of this administration' -- Bush has managed to ad lib with an 

overall coherence that is, for him, extraordinary."



<p>Miller adds that "the president has lately spoken relatively well 

for the same reason that he's always broken into sudden fits of lucid 

English -- because, in speaking of our national mission of revenge, he's 

speaking from the heart." In fact, George W. Bush "has always spoken 

clearly on those subjects that genuinely matter to him. Thus it is that, 

when he talks about baseball, say, or about his property in Crawford, he 

has no problems with his syntax, grammar or vocabulary."



<p>Professor Miller, who specializes in media studies at New York 

University, contends that Bush also "is most articulate when speaking 

cruelly -- on the value of the death penalty, or when cracking jokes, or 

when saying no. It's when he tries to sound a higher note -- 

idealistically, or out of magnanimity, or on his trademark theme of 

'compassion' -- that Bush starts speaking broken English, because, like 

most of us, his tongue will not cooperate when he is being insincere."



<p>These days, President Bush is evidently sincere about wanting the 

missiles to keep flying and the bombs to keep falling on Afghanistan -- 

circumstances that notably enhance his verbal skills. The fact that large 

numbers of Afghan people are now facing imminent starvation due to the 

ongoing attacks does not seem to bother our nation's leading compassionate 

conservative. "The president," says Miller, "has lately spoken with unusual 

coherence in his off-the-cuff remarks -- because his subject nowadays is war."



<p><i>Note to online readers of "Media Beat": You can access free audio and video 

of Norman Solomon's recent appearance on C-SPAN's "Washington Journal" at 

<a href="http://www.c-span.org/journal/" target="_new">www.c-span.org/journal/</a> -- listed under Monday, Oct. 15. The one-hour 

program focuses on media coverage of terrorism and the bombing of 

Afghanistan. (The audio and video will remain posted on the C-SPAN site 

until about Oct. 24.)
