The last several weeks have been an interesting lesson in semiotics, the 

language of symbols. What does the United States’ flag mean? Some voices on 

the American Left have been grumbling about the mass unfurling in the wake 

of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. Katha Pollitt writes in the Nation that 

she will not fly the U.S. flag because it “stands for jingoism and vengeance 

and war.” San Francisco Gate columnist Neva Chonin is uncomfortable with her 

community’s newfound patriotism, and suggests that “what's needed is a new 

symbol for those who want to express both national diversity and national 

solidarity, but not national chauvinism.”



<p>As if intent on personifying that very spirit of chauvinism, the jingoists 

and chauvinists have been out in force. Right-wing hyperventilator Ann 

Coulter wrote of the terrorists, on Sept. 12, that the United States “should 

invade their countries, kill their leaders and convert them to 

Christianity.” She was not being ironic, although it’s difficult to see how 

one might convert a dead terrorist. Coulter is also apparently ignorant of 

the fact that, if comparing numbers of innocents slaughtered, Christianity 

beats Islam with a big stick. Rich Lowry of National Review writes that “if 

only Osama bin Laden and his 50 closest advisers and followers die in the 

next couple of weeks, President Bush will have failed in a great military 

and moral challenge of his presidency.” Why do I see Lowry licking his 

chops?



<p>I have no problem with the flying of the flag, and the reason for this is 

that I never surrendered it to the likes of Coulter and Lowry, the 

militarists, the America-firsters, all those now predictably beating the war 

drums, as if a display of national military strength were a confirmation of 

their own potency. To many of them the flag is a symbol of power, of empire, 

and they cleave to it grossly and publicly, convinced of the absolute 

rightness of the American way. These are the fundamentalists of our own 

political culture; they are emblematic of our diversity just as are the 

Hasidic book-binder, the Sikh cab driver, the libertarian survivalist.



<p>There are as many particular meanings to the American flag as there are 

Americans. To me the flag represents a set of ideas, goals to be aspired to, 

values to be upheld, a society to be created. Over the years, I have 

frequently been ashamed of my government, but never of my country. This is a 

distinction that many often fail to make. Some on the right consider any 

criticism of American foreign policy equal to urinating on Washington’s 

grave, while many on the left see a flag in a shop window as endorsement of 

the carpet bombing of civilians on Christmas.



<p>When I see the flag, I often think of my grandparents and my infant father, 

steaming into New York harbor one morning in 1952 on a boat-load of 

refugees. They had escaped Soviet terror in the forties and spent several 

years in German camps. They were luckier than millions of others, and they 

knew it, and they would never let their children or grandchildren forget it. 

Every Thanksgiving, before the meal, my grandfather would get up and say the 

prayer. From the old school, he was not a man who betrayed much emotion, but 

the tears came to his eyes as he said this prayer, year after year, thanking 

God for bringing our family to this land where we could live and worship 

freely, where we did not have to fear our neighbors or our government. Now 

my grandfather is gone, and my grandmother gives this prayer, and someday it 

will be my turn, and I will give thanks without reservation and probably 

with tears, knowing that this ritual is repeated around tables in every 

American village, town, and city.



<p>So, distasteful as I find such wing-tip-warrior swill as that dished by 

Coulter and Lowry, I wholeheartedly support their right to call for death 

even as I, and others, call for life. A bit more strained, I support the 

right of Pollitt and Chonin to reject the national symbol, however poorly 

reasoned I feel is their rejection. What we all want, in the end, after all, 

is for the people of Afghanistan to be able to do the same: to be able to 

strenuously and publicly disagree with each other and with their government. 

To me, this is what the flag embodies. As others are certain, so I am 

certain.
