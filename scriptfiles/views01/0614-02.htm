Velda González may be 68 years old, the vice president of the Senate in Puerto Rico and a grandmother several times over. But none of that mattered to U.S. Navy officials who treated her like trash, which is the same way they've treated so many others who have been arrested for protesting the Navy's bombing exercises on the island of Vieques.

<P> Ms. González was with a large group of protesters, including a U.S. congressman, Luis Gutierrez of Illinois, who were arrested on Vieques in April and subjected to harsh, dangerous and at times sadistic treatment at the hands of Navy personnel. Details of the arrests made that weekend have been emerging through interviews and a hearing held in Washington last week by members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus. </P>

<P> Ms. González and dozens of others were rounded up by security personnel on the afternoon of April 28 and charged with trespassing on Navy property. "As soon as they caught us," said Ms. González in a telephone interview on Tuesday, "we offered our hands and they handcuffed us."</P>

<P> The detainees were taken by truck to a fenced-in detention area. Several, still handcuffed, were forced to kneel for extended periods on the gravel and rock-strewn ground. They were taunted and told by their captors to "eat dirt."</P>

<P> One of those kneeling was Congressman Gutierrez. The military guards became enraged when he lifted one of his legs and extended it behind him while he tried awkwardly to clear some debris from the spot where he was kneeling.</P>

<P> The congressman and several witnesses, including Ms. González, said two of the guards grabbed Mr. Gutierrez by his shirt and trousers, lifted him in the air and tossed him several feet. When he landed face down they began kicking him.</P>

<P> "I was yelling, 'He's a congressman! He's a congressman!' " said Ms. González.</P>

<P> After being held overnight in the detention area, the detainees were taken by barge to the main island of Puerto Rico. Some of the prisoners were forced to kneel in the hot sun on the deck of the barge. Young women kneeling on the deck were harassed by officers who made obscene comments and gestures.</P>

<P> Ms. González said the prisoners were worried because they were still handcuffed and were not wearing life jackets. She said they were told that prisoners given life jackets would be required to have their hands cuffed behind their backs.</P>

<P> "That would force us to lean forward if we were in the water, even with a life jacket," said Ms. González. "We would drown if there was an accident. So we preferred to stay with our hands cuffed in the front."</P>

<P> The ordeal that caused Ms. González to weep was still to come.</P>

<P> The prisoners were subjected to body searches at a processing center. For some reason, when it was Ms. González's turn to be searched, she was taken outside, and the search was conducted in public. "They made the most indecent, disgusting, immoral search of me, out in the street, in front of a cyclone fence with 20 Navy men watching," she said. </P>

<P> It was more an exercise in humiliation than a real search. It was conducted by a woman who began by lifting Ms. González's blouse. The rest of the search consisted of the very public rubbing, squeezing and mauling — through her clothing — of the vice president of the Puerto Rican Senate. </P>

<P> Ms. González underwent radiation treatment for breast cancer a few years ago, which has left her breasts very tender. She began to cry on the telephone as she described the mortification and the physical pain she felt during the search.</P>

<P> "This was in front of everybody," said Ms. González. "I'm an old woman. I'm a grandmother of 11 grandchildren."</P>

<P> There were many other abuses detailed at the hearing in Washington, which was headed by Representative Robert Menendez of New Jersey. But the Navy seems unconcerned. A spokesman, Lt. Cory Barker, told me yesterday, "There are no formal investigations by the Navy at this point because we have not deemed that, in fact, we have had any cases of abuse or excessive force."</P>

<P> I asked him if the testimony of a U.S. congressman supported by eyewitnesses was enough to prompt the Navy to at least investigate further. </P>

<P> He said no. </P>
