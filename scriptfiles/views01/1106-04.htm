How do you wage a war on terrorism? We wish we knew.



<p>How do you strike back when your country has been attacked? We are learning, in the mountains of Afghanistan, how not to do it.



<p>The war is a month old, and the polls show continued support for the President. But some support abroad is beginning to crumble, doubts are creeping up in the American news media and a recent poll demonstrates the public’s nervousness. Only a fourth of Americans think the military will kill or capture Osama bin Laden, according to a New York Times-CBS poll published Oct. 30, and only three in 10 think the international alliance will hold.



<p>We are still waiting for someone to provide a really cogent argument that bombing the nation of Afghanistan and its people makes sense and is the right thing to do.



<p>There is very good reason for the United States to be mad as hell about Sept. 11, as well as scared as hell about what the terrorists might do next. And feelings of retaliation and revenge are understandable—if not right. To put it simply, the United States is fully justified in doing all it can to capture the perpetrators and bring them to justice, but it has no business dropping bombs on Afghanistan.



<p>The war may eventually topple the Taliban. The new Afghan government may at some point be able to place bin Laden under arrest. But at what cost and at what benefit? Innocent civilians are dying daily and U.S. credibility is dying with them. The capture of bin Laden and other Al Qaeda militants won’t deter terrorists elsewhere in the world, even in this country.



<p>More frightening even than the civilian casualties is the possibility of mass starvation in Afghanistan. Aid agencies say more than six million Afghans, nearly a quarter of the country’s population, are at severe risk of starvation this winter. As Sen. Paul Wellstone (D., Minn.) told the Toronto Globe & Mail (Nov. 3): "If a humanitarian catastrophe is attributed to our military operations, it could pull apart our international coalition to fight terrorism, radicalize more people who might be sympathetic to the terrorists’ views, and may even make the American people more vulnerable in the end."



<p>We must give the highest priority to protecting America from further attack—from violence, anthrax, or whatever source—while realizing, as disturbing as it is, that 100 percent protection from foreign terrorists or from our own Timothy McVeighs is impossible. We must capture those responsible for Sept. 11. But we also must reexamine our pre-September foreign policy. Doing so is in no way an admission that "we had it coming." Nor is it a vindication of the terrorists’ acts. It is nothing more than an acknowledgement of the obvious—that if I want to get along on the playground, I’d better be aware of how the other kids feel about the way I act. 



<p>Perhaps more important, the United States must be tolerant of dissent. In wartime many people proclaim "my country, right or wrong." I happen to be a patriotic American who believes my country is not all right.
