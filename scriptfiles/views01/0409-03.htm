Timothy McVeigh, who is scheduled to be executed May 16, has

solidified his position as the poster boy of cold-blooded villainy. The

Oklahoma City bomber has once again outraged the American public when he

described the 19 dead children among his 168 victims as "collateral

damage" in an interview.

<p>Although it scarcely seemed possible, this appalling comment has made

McVeigh an even more despised figure in American society. It produced

widespread and justified expressions of revulsion and anger at his lack

of regard for even the most innocent of his victims.

<p>There is no doubt that McVeigh is an exceptionally malevolent and

brutal criminal. Yet the rest of us may not be as distant from his

propensity to rationalize the killing of innocents as we prefer to

believe. All too often, good people allow themselves to believe that the

end justifies the means, that "war is hell." Or they find some other

means to dismiss the deaths of those who did nothing to deserve being

killed.

<p>It is worth recalling where McVeigh got this chillingly antiseptic

phrase "collateral damage." It was coined by the Pentagon during the Gulf

War to describe the deaths of innocent Iraqis during the massive bombing

campaign in 1991 and was an attempt to obscure and rationalize these

deaths through Orwellian jargon.

<p>"Collateral damage" during the Gulf War included, in only one

instance, 313 people incinerated at the Amiriya bomb shelter in western

Baghdad, which was deliberately attacked.

<p>When asked about the extent of Iraqi casualties toward the end of the

Gulf War, then-military Chief of Staff Colin Powell blandly remarked:

"That is really not a matter I am terribly interested in."

<p>Indeed, it is not a matter that has ever seemed to concern too many

Americans. The same applies to the effects of sanctions on innocent Iraqi

civilians over the past decade. Asked by an interviewer if the deaths of

500,000, not 19, Iraqi children because of sanctions could possibly be

justified, then-Secretary of State Madeleine Albright did not dispute the

figure or the causality, but instead simply remarked: "We think the price

is worth it."

<p>McVeigh was a gunner on a Bradley fighting vehicle during the Gulf War

and told his relatives that "after the first time, it got easy" to kill

Iraqis. It is possible that by invoking the awful phrase "collateral

damage," McVeigh is not only repeating a rhetorical device for denial he

learned in the military service, but he is actually taunting the

government, and even society at large, for its own propensity for callous

indifference.

<p>"Collateral damage" also was invoked to describe the effects of

attacks on civilian passenger trains, refugee convoys and the

headquarters of Radio Television Serbia during the war in Kosovo.

<p>And who remembers, or ever even cared about, the night watchman killed

during the missile attack on the Shifa factory in Sudan, a facility no

one now denies was simply making badly needed medicines, not chemical

weapons?

<p>Of course, these psychological defenses are not confined to U.S.

society. They approach a depressing universality. To take another

example, the process of rationalizing the deaths of innocents is clearly

evident on both sides of the ongoing Palestinian-Israeli conflict.

<p>Objections from Americans that the Gulf and Kosovo wars were "just,"

from Palestinians that liberation must be achieved "by any means

necessary" or from Israelis that they must ensure their security "at all

costs" merely illustrate how the process of rationalization actually

works. Once we begin to accept the pernicious notion that the ends

justify the means, a callous moral blindness is the inevitable result.

<p>In our tendency to rationalize and accept the killing of innocents,

there may be more of McVeigh in most of us than we would care to admit.
