Speaking on CNN on Sunday, National Security Advisor, 
Condoleezza Rice said Saddam was on the U.S. ''radar scope'' and that the Bush 
administration would use military force against his government in a ``more 
resolute manner'' than in the past. 
<br>
<br>
While you're wondering what "more resolute" might mean. Consider <A href="http://www.nonviolence.org/vitw/pages/135.htm" target="new">this report, 
from Voices in the Wilderness</a>, who sent a delegation to Mosul and Tel A'fer, Iraq, last month. They interviewed locals near the soccer field at Tel A'fer which 
U.S. forces bombed at 11:30 a.m. on June 19. The Voices team arrived at 
noon on June 21:
<br>
<br>
The team spent two hours at the soccer field. They said the site was strewn 
with large pieces of bomb debris, two pieces of which bore English writing 
with serial numbers and dates.  
<br>
<br>
Doctors at the Tel A'fer General Hospital told them that of the 23 people who 
died, 21 were younger than 17. Initially there were 12 injured survivors, all 
but one of whom are under 17. Three were referred to the Mosul 
General Hospital, and of those three, one has already died. At the Tel A'fer 
General hospital, delegation members met nine boys who suffered blast 
injuries and were in wretched condition, with deep lacerations and burns.  
<br>
<br>
Ahmed  Shakur, age 13, suffered deep lacerations to his scapula and buttocks. 
 He has lost hearing in his left ear. His younger brother, Ali, was killed.  
His 39-year-old brother, Fatha, was with him. They said they didn’t think 
the American people would do this and asked, "Why has this happened here?  Why us?  Why now?" 
<br>
<br>
Another Voices delegation left from Chicago last Thursday. Traveling with the 
39th Voices delegation to Iraq are Joe Proulx, of Chicago, Leah Wells of 
Ventura, Calif., and Paul Rehm, of Albany, N.Y. Leading the delegation will be Jeff 
Guntzel and Danny Muller. Five United Kingdom members, three of who are students, will join them in Baghdad.  
<br>
<br>
Those folks are the resolute ones. Condoleezza Rice should hear today from 
everyone who cares about them and the Iraqi people.
