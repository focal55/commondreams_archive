GEORGE W. BUSH sallies forth on the world stage proclaiming that the United

States will go it alone on global warming and missile defense. These are acts

of such arrogance that it takes one's breath away.

<P>

    This is the man who lost the popular vote by about 500,000 votes and beat

his opponent by only four electoral votes (even that was a judgment call). Yet

he functions as though the American people gave him a mandate to do anything he

wishes.

<P>

    He seems caught up in wanting to appear strong. But his actions belie such

pretension. Deliberately upsetting the status quo without recognizing the

consequences is a sign of confusion.

<P>

    Bush has brought back the imperial presidency with a conceit not seen since

the days of Lyndon Johnson and Richard Nixon. His foreign policies are

undermining the substantial progress, so painstakingly achieved since World War

II, to solve world problems through international cooperation.

<P>

    Only on foreign trade is Bush a paragon of internationalism.

<P>

    And what is just as alarming has been the reaction from many members of the

mainstream press and Congress. We are supposed to be a nation governed by the

will of the people. Yet observing most media coverage of the president, a

citizen could easily think that only the president has the power to make public

policy.

<P>

    With some exceptions, members of Congress have done little to temper Bush's

headlong stumble into revolutionary change. There is no doubt that Bush is out

to make over American policy.

<P>

    He may call himself conservative, but he is not.

<P>

    He is an insurgent who is out to upend America's defenses, eliminate our

progressive tax system, undermine the separation of church and state, reduce

environmental protection, and turn the clock back on reproductive rights.

<P>

    Whether Democratic, Republican or Independent, members of Congress have

been slow to respond to Bush's actions. Approving a tax cut that will soon

bring us back into deficit spending has shown how spineless some public

officials are.

<P>

    The most ludicrous example of wastefulness was congressional approval of a

letter to taxpayers, telling us we were going to get a tax refund, which will

cost about $116 million. In the meantime, the surplus dwindles and the debt

grows. And those in Washington, who told us last fall they would secure

Medicare and Social Security, vote for short-term benefit and long-term damage.

<P>

    Deference toward the president has reached egregious proportions in the

last six weeks. Initially, the battle over federal funding of stem cell

research focused on the president because President Bill Clinton had issued an

executive order approving limited funding. But this battle is about more than

what the president should do.

<P>

    It is the first chapter in a long saga that will dominate scientific

advancement in the 21st century. The decision as to whether medical researchers

will be helped or hindered by the federal government is too important to be

left to one man, yet the mainstream media have covered this story as though

only Bush's decision would decide its fate.

<P>

    Where has Congress been? Why have we been subjected to this simplistic

will-Bush-do-it mystery when the final resolution must rest with members of the

House and Senate?

    Why have Congress and the mainstream media been so slow to analyze in

detail Bush's revolutionary assumptions?

    I don't think the motivating factor is fear of the president's wrath. The

media have seldom been afraid on that count before. And why should Congress

fear a president who doesn't have a mandate to overturn policies most Americans

support?

    The culprit appears to be a misguided willingness to give the president the

benefit of the doubt on too many issues. With his smile and his strange ways,

he has dulled too many people's good sense.

<P>

    It is time to take off the gloves. We need to question:

    Why the United States has become the odd-man out on world environmental and

defense issues,

    Why the advancement of scientific inquiry is being held hostage at the

White House,

    Why our carefully balanced separation of church and state doctrine is being

torn asunder,

    Why the rich are gettting such great tax benefits from the government and

    Why environmental protections are being dismantled and reproductive rights

undermined.

<P>

    All of us, regardless of party, better wake up and start questioning where

this accidental, revolutionary president is taking the nation. Bush's agenda is

not business as usual.
