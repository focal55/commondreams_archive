It is now official. The United States administration will back out of the 
1972 Anti Ballistic Missile (ABM) treaty despite severe misgivings on the 
part of many public figures at home and most of its allies abroad. President 
Bush, in his remarks to reporters at Crawford, Texas, has finally said the 
US will renounce the treaty. It will do so on its "own timetable" and 
because, in Mr Bush's view, the treaty hampers the ability of the United 
States "to keep the peace, to develop defensive weapons necessary to defend 
America against the true threat of the 21st century."
<p>


This threat has been identified as one of "rogue states" developing the 
capacity to strike at the United States with missiles carrying weapons of 
mass destruction. The states most often mentioned are Iran, Iraq, Libya and 
North Korea. None of these countries currently poses such a threat but 
Washington believes it should develop a missile defense system just in case 
someday they might. To develop this system would entail a breach of ABM 
which has been seen by most neutral observers as the cornerstone of 
international security. There are justified fears that without ABM the 
entire web of arms-control agreements would unravel to be replaced by a new, 
if unequal, arms race.
<p>

Opposition to Mr Bush's policy has come not only from America's former cold 
war enemies in Russia and China, but also from within the North Atlantic 
Treaty Organization alliance, as well as from political observers in the 
United States itself. In <a href="http://www.ireland.com/newspaper/world/2001/0825/wor2.htm" target="_new">today's editions</a> of this newspaper, a former 
Republican US defense secretary, Mr Melvin R Laird contends that the Bush 
administration is leading the US down the path of isolationism and 
unilateralism.
<p>
Under Mr Bush, the US has refused to submit to the Kyoto protocol on climate 
change and the small-arms control pact. It has insisted that the proposed 
International Criminal Court should have no jurisdiction over US citizens; 
it has opposed the convention on germ warfare and it has been in two minds 
about attending the UN conference on racism in Durban.
<p>

There are signs that the administration's outlook may be reflected in areas 
of US society previously impervious to such attitudes. In a recent editorial 
urging the Secretary of State, Mr Colin Powell, to stay away from the Durban 
conference, The New York Times wrote that his presence would "lend the 
gathering a distinction it has not earned". The suggestion that 
international assemblies are without distinction unless a senior American is 
present, betrays a mind-set in which less powerful countries and their 
representatives are seen as inferior. At a time when all other countries are 
less powerful than the US, the development of such a world-view is 
disturbing.
