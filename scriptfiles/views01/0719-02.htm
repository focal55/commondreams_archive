WHERE IS Al Gore? Maybe he hasn't noticed, but all sorts of horrible 

things are happening under the Bush administration -- just as he predicted. 

Yet Gore has been totally silent.

<P>That may be his right as a victim of blatant election fraud, but please 

don't even suggest that this milquetoast be given another chance to be the 

Democratic candidate for president. Milquetoast is not a word to be used 

lightly in describing the shell-shocked behavior of someone cheated out of the 

presidency, but the wound-licking has gone on long enough.

<P>True, as the New York Times documented in excruciating detail Sunday, a six-

month investigation found new evidence that the Florida election was distorted 

by the partisan miscounting of absentee votes. When added to the rest of the 

evidence from Florida, it's obvious that Gore won both the national popular 

and electoral votes, and should be president. The Republicans played ugly, 

they misused the power of Congress and the Florida state government to exclude 

ballots for Gore while including others with the same flaws for Bush.

<P>What the Republicans did was reprehensible, and when combined with the foul 

partisanship of the Supreme Court majority, arguably the lowest point in 

modern American electoral history. But that's all the more reason to take them 

on now before they do more damage.

<P>If Gore cared about the issues he raised during the campaign, why isn't he 

front and center in the leadership of the loyal opposition? He's not the only 

one hurting, it's the whole country.

<P>While Gore, who decisively won the popular vote, sulks, George the Second 

seems to wake up each morning convinced that he has a mandate to do as much 

damage to foreign and domestic policy as possible.

<P>Not content with dismissing the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty as a relic, 

he now threatens to destroy the test ban treaty, as well. Global warming is to 

be accepted as quite possibly a good thing, energy conservation is dismissed 

as a foolish notion, and the vital work of Planned Parenthood and other world 

population-control groups has been sacrificed on the altar of Republican 

fundamentalism.

<P>In a con act that would land a private-sector executive in jail, Bush sold 

Congress on a mythical recession-proof budget surplus that could be both given 

away as a tax rebate and simultaneously spent on increased military spending.

<P>If the recession is prolonged, as it now threatens to be, the projected 

surplus will shrivel further, and long-term funding for Social Security and 

Medicare once again will be threatened.

<P>Is Gore unaware that the high-tech economy, which the Clinton 

administration nourished for eight years, is now in shambles and that the net 

worth of the average American is in serious decline?

<P>Clinton's agenda was pretty moderate, but at least he knew that the federal 

government was not the enemy and that a huge tax cut for the rich was hardly a 

prudent alternative to adequately funding essential public services.

<P>Clinton's personal behavior may have been juvenile, but his public policies 

were most often well thought out and serious. The Bush offspring seems to view 

the making of public policy as nothing more than the collating of corporate 

lobbyists' wish lists.

<P>Gore will not defend the achievements of the Clinton-Gore years because he 

still has problems admitting that he was a member of that winning team. His 

Clinton phobia is what cost Gore a tamper-proof win in the election, and it's 

the source of his failure to effectively critique the Bush administration.

<P>To put it bluntly: Gore is nothing without Clinton, and his inability to 

boldly champion the eight years of the Clinton administration's record has 

rendered him politically impotent.
