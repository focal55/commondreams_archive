Can the Bush Administration actually get

away with privatizing and cutting the nation's

most successful government program? Social

Security provides support to 45 million people --

nearly one out of six Americans. It keeps half of

the nation's elderly above the poverty line. For

these reasons it was long considered politically

untouchable. Yet we are currently in the midst of

a prolonged campaign to partially privatize the

system and reduce its benefits.



         <p>The outcome will depend quite a bit on

how much the "reformers" -- which include

powerful Wall Street financial interests -- can get

away with lying about Social Security.



         <p>"The threat to the stability of Social

Security has been apparent for decades . . . " said

President Bush last month. "We can postpone

action no longer. Social Security is a challenge

now; if we fail to act, it will become a crisis."



         <p>It so happens that Social Security is

financially in better shape than it has been for

most of its 65-year history, including the 1940s,

50s, 60s, and 70s. But you would never know that

from reading the newspapers.



         <p>The only "threat to the stability of Social

Security" comes from the "President's

Commission to Strengthen Social Security." Who

are they kidding with that name? They fully

intend to slice off a chunk of Social Security's

revenue for private individual accounts, and then

cut benefits to make up for the shortfall. These

guys could make Orwell blush.



         <p>According to the numbers that President

Bush and everyone else in the debate is relying

upon, Social Security will be able to pay all

promised benefits for the next 37 years, without

any changes whatsoever. And there is no "crisis"

involved in extending the program's benefits for

the whole 75-year planning period: the shortfall is

less than three-fourths of one percent of our

national income.



         <p>If it were only President Bush saying these

things about Social Security, they could be

dismissed as merely an effort to promote

privatization. But many journalists share his

confusion on the subject.



         <p>The Washington Post reported in a news

article last week that Social Security "is predicted

to start becoming financially unstable in the

middle of the next decade." Financially unstable?

According the latest Social Security Trustees'

report, in 2015 the program will have income of

$868.5 billion, and expenses of $678.4

billion, giving it an annual surplus of $190.1

billion. The accumulated Trust Fund will have

$3.1 trillion dollars. (These figures are in 2001,

inflation-adjusted dollars).



         <p>Again, none of the members of the

President's Commission would dispute these

numbers. Instead, they try to fool the public and

the press with the equivalent of one half of a

baseball score. As in "the Orioles had a bad game:

they only scored two runs." Without telling you

that the other team didn't score any.



         <p>Take Richard Parsons, Chief Operating

Officer of AOL Time-Warner and co-chair of the

President's Commission. "When you have two

workers for every retired person, it can't work; do

the math," he says, referring to the Trustees'

projections for 30 years from now. Well, the

actuaries at Social Security have done the math,

and it works just fine. The system may eventually

need a bit more revenue, because people will be

living longer. But it will be a very small amount

relative to the nation's future income.



        <p> There is every reason to believe that

people who are living longer, and earning 40 or

50 percent more (adjusted for inflation) than we

do today would be willing to spend an additional

one or two percent of their income, in order to

support a longer retirement. They have always

been willing to do this in the past. But even if they

weren't, there is hardly any reason to be worrying

about it now.



         <p>And very few people would be worried

about Social Security if they had any idea what

the numbers looked like. But most people don't: in

fact, as a result of a highly successful

disinformation campaign, they do not even

believe they will see their promised benefits.

Ironically, if the President's Commission were to

have its way, this could come true.



         <p>In about six and a half years the first baby

boomers will begin to retire, and there will be no

noticeable impact on Social Security or on the

federal budget. Perhaps then it will finally be

obvious that this whole story about Social

Security's financial troubles was nothing more

than an urban legend.
