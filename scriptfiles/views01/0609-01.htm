The ‘coup of one,’ as Trent Lott of Mississippi rather sourly described

the Senate revolution forced by James Jeffords of Vermont when he became

an Independent, could have large effect on the United Nations as well as

on Congress.

<p>



That’s because of the downfall of the UN’s arch-critic in the Senate,

the main force behind US arrears in dues to the world

organization--Jesse Helms the elderly right-wing Republican from North

Carolina. Helms will no longer be chairman of the Foreign Relations

Committee. Joseph Biden of Delaware, not only a Democrat but a younger

and far less conservative legislator than Helms, has assumed the

chairmanship.

<p>



Biden will be less cantankerous than Helms surely would have been about

UN matters,  and also is likely--though a Democrat--to be more

sympathetic than Helms to Bush’s ambassadorial appointments and other

foreign policy actions.

<p>



Helms, moreover, is coming to the end of his fifth term and will be 81

years old if he seeks re-election in 2002--which, owing to age,

infirmity and a greater-than-usual possibility of defeat, is not at all

certain. Even if he should run and win, however, Senate Republican rules

will not allow him to be the ranking member of the Foreign Relations

Committee, if the Democrats, as expected, retain Senate control that

year. That distinction would go to Richard Lugar, a moderate Republican

from Indiana.

<p>



The Helms-Biden exchange is one of the two most important switches in

committee chairmanships caused by Jeffords, when he became an

Independent and handed control of the Senate to a 50-seat Democratic

majority. It’s equally or perhaps more important that Jeffords’

Democratic colleague from Vermont, Patrick Leahy, now becomes chairman

of the Judiciary Committee. Leahy will bring greater scrutiny to

judgeship nominations by President Bush, including nominees for the

Supreme Court.

<p>



In fact, the ‘coup of one’ set off by Jeffords is a sort of chain

reaction that affects the Republicans in several important ways. The

loss of the Senate also means that the importance of the slender

Republican majority in the House will be diminished. Whatever

legislation the House may approve still will have to pass a newly

Democratic Senate before becoming law. So it may not be factual but it

may be correct in practice to say that, owing to  Jeffords, Bush and his

party have lost effective control of Congress, not just real control of

the Senate.

<p>



That being so, Dick Armey and Tom DeLay, the powerful Texas Republican

conservatives who hold sway in the House, where Speaker Dennis Hastert

of Illinois seems little more than a figurehead, have been shorn of some

power. In the Senate, of course, such downgrading obviously has befallen

both majority leader Trent Lott and Vice President Richard Cheney, whose

constitutional authority to break ties had given the Republicans their

only claim to majority status.

<p>



Because of the Republican party’s sharply reduced power in both houses,

even Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld also faces a bleaker

legislative outlook than he did only a few days ago. That could

drastically affect one of Bush’s strongest campaign pledges, his promise

to build and deploy a national missile defense even at the cost of

withdrawal from the long-standing Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty.

<p>



So if six of the Republicans’ strongest conservative leaders--Lott,

Cheney, Helms, Armey, DeLay and Rumsfeld--have lost standing and

effectiveness, the entire right wing of the Republican party has been

hit hard. Since it has also appeared since his inauguration that Bush

was catering politically to that wing--if he is not actually controlled

by it- the course of his Administration is bound to become more

moderate. And the President’s actions and manner since the Jeffords

thunder-clap seem to reflect that prospect.

<p>



There has been no national outcry against this seismic shift in the

political terrain, and Vermont--my home state as well as Jeffords’s-

seems mostly to celebrate rather than condemn his defection. Trent

Lott’s complaint that the Democrats lack the ‘moral authority’ of an

elected majority therefore seems more petulant than logical. What moral

authority could be claimed by the former Republican ‘majority’--actually

an even 50-50 split with the Democrats that reflected Republican losses

in the 2000 elections?

<p>



What moral authority, for that matter, does even George W. Bush have,

after losing the national popular vote and carrying a disputed electoral

college only because of a one-vote victory in a basically conservative

Supreme Court?

<p>



Lott and other Republicans would do well to leave ‘moral authority’ out

of the question of who controls the Senate--or the Presidency. Seldom

have there been more graphic lessons than those provided, first by the

Supreme Court last November, next by James Jeffords this year, that

American politics is a power game, not a morality play. Victory goes,

not necessarily to virtue, but to him--more and more often to her--who

has the votes.
