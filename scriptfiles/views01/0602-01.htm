WASHINGTON -- Isn't this a fine howdy-do we've gotten from the team who promised us compassionate conservatism and the restoration of morality and ethics in the White House?

<p>Such a "conservatism" Barry Goldwater never would have recognized. I've taken him as the exemplar of the species ever since 1960, when my brother sought to embarrass our middle-of-the-road parents by slipping a copy of "Conscience of a Conservative" onto the mantel as their friends arrived for dinner.</p>

<p>Now I read about White House support for "family-building," with grants to promote "responsible fatherhood," provide marriage counseling and teach character in high school. I see former Christian Coalition official Marshall Wittman declaring to The Washington Post, "What we're seeing is the triumph of big government conservatism." </p>

<p>Just imagine what the crusty old Arizonan, who believed so keenly in freedom from the dictates of a central government, would have thought.</p>

<p>Another thing Goldwater held dear was fiscal responsibility. Yet the allegedly conservative Ronald Reagan and his successor, George Bush, quadrupled the debt in 12 years. And now Bush the son threatens more of the same, with his huge tax cut. </p>

<p>Speaking of the tax cut, what of the "compassion" part of Bush's pledge? Sure, the rich get richer. But is it compassionate to hasten the process? Bush often says: "I don't think the U.S. Congress ought to be able to pick and choose the winners in society." In fact, he and Congress have accomplished quite a feat of income redistribution. Fully in place, this cut will bestow more than $3,000 a month on the average taxpayer in the top 1 percent income level -- and that's a low-end estimate. The poorest 20 percent will, on average, get less than $6 a month.</p>

<p>Moving on to "morality" -- and sticking with Goldwater -- a recent New York Review of Books piece on the new book, "Before the Storm: Barry Goldwater and the Unmaking of the American Consensus," reminds us that "Goldwater believed that the business of America was business. Today's conservatism, heavily influenced by a Christian fundamentalist vote, holds that the business of America is also morality."</p>

<p>Goldwater would have quaked at government telling us what constitutes morality. There are so many possibilities. My morality says we should support good child care, generously. It's been shown to keep kids out of trouble, it would meet one of American families' most pressing needs and it's just, well, the proper thing to do. The right (having ceded its previous, stronger argument that the state doesn't belong in the family-support business) says child care would undermine families.</p>

<p>My morality calls for energy conservation and for vigorously curbing the harm American habits are doing to the environment. This administration's morality demands more oil wells and spurns the Kyoto treaty on global warming.</p>

<p>They're in office and I'm not, so their version wins. I just wish they'd lose the false advertising. Proclamations of conservatism followed by actions that are anything but, people carrying on about things having gone to hell in a handbasket and acting as if they have a lock on morality -- well, it all makes you want to cheer when the moralizers slip up.</p>

<p>You get an inappropriate satisfaction out of things like discovering that the divorce rate is highest in the Bible Belt. Or out of sentiments like one in a recent Sunday New York Times Magazine piece on the porn industry: A fellow named Michael Raven, having grown up in a religious home, is now a top director of porn movies -- the absurd shorthand for which is "adult." He said, "I've leaned toward the right in my politics, but I'm bothered by the Republicans' association with the religious right. I know from my experience of religious people that those who protest and scream the loudest usually have the biggest collection of adult under their bed."</p>

<p>How can we alternative-morality types, recalling a different breed of conservatives, not get a kick out of that?</p>

<p>Finally, consider the "ethics" restoration part of the pledge by Bush and company. They howled, quite rightly, about the deplorable fund-raising practices of their predecessors -- using public property, for example. So what should happen now, but Dick Cheney invites 400 big donors to his official residence? Oh -- they tell us -- it's <i>nothing</i> like those White House coffees and Lincoln Bedroom sleepovers; we were simply thanking people for donating.</p>

<p>Please. It isn't right for the moralizers to make the rest of us behave in this unseemly way, delighting in their missteps. If only they'd quit the "moral monopoly" talk, I'd so gladly give up this little vice.</p>

<p>But not until then.
