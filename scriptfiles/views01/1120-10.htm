Who is America's weakest link in response to the atrocities of Sept. 11? According to a new report by the American Council of Trustees and Alumni (ACTA), "college and university faculty have been the weak link."

<p>

Founded by Vice President Dick Cheney's wife, Lynne, ACTA issued the report last week, black-listing over 40 college professors and administrators for not being "patriotic" enough.

<p>

The report concludes that America's college campuses are hostile toward the <IMG align=left hspace=14 vspace=14 SRC=images/seanlogo.jpg WIDTH=94 HEIGHT=124 BORDER=0>U.S. government and in opposition to the views of most Americans who support the war in Afghanistan, whatever that means.

<p>

Douglas Bennet, president of Wesleyan University, was singled out by ACTA for Hester Prynne-treatment because of a letter he wrote in the Sept. 11 aftermath. Bennet's letter condemned the terrorist attacks, but that wasn't enough to pass ACTA's true-patriot litmus test.

<p>

Bennet also expressed concern that "disparities and injustices" at home and abroad can lead to violence. He also suggested that societies ought to look at the world "through the sensitivities of others."

<p>

Anne Neal, co-author of the report, told a Boston Globe reporter that "for the most part, public comments in academia were equivocal and often pointing the finger at America rather than the terrorists."

<p>

Meanwhile, the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops were at work on a document of their own. It was released within days of ACTA's report, and written by a committee chaired by Cardinal Bernard F. Law of Boston. You can check out the full text at www.nccbuscc.org/sdwp/sept11.htm.

<p>

Proclaiming that "every life is precious, whether a person works at the World Trade Center or lives in Afghanistan," the bishops' conference released a "pastoral message" giving limited support to the war on terrorism, while urging broader attention to global injustices.

<p>

"The events of Sept. 11 were unique in their scale, but they were not isolated. Sadly, our world is losing respect for human life. Those who committed these atrocities do not distinguish between ordinary civilians and military combatants," the statement says.

<p>

"The dreadful deeds of Sept. 11 cannot go unanswered. We continue to urge resolve, restraint and greater attention to the roots of terrorism to protect against further attacks and to advance the global common good... .

<p>

"No grievance, no matter what the claim, can legitimate what happened on Sept. 11. Without in any way excusing indefensible terrorist acts, we still need to address those conditions of poverty and injustice which are exploited by terrorists," the statement continues.

<p>

The document calls for a renewed effort in a peaceful resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict that respects both the security of Israel and allows for the emergence of a "viable Palestinian state."

<p>

The statement urges an immediate end to the U.S.-imposed economic embargo against Iraq.

<p>

"The leaders of the Iraqi regime bear a heavy responsibility for this suffering... . At the same time, the comprehensive economic sanctions, even as modified by the 'oil-for-food' program, are causing horrendous suffering and must be brought to an end without delay. The goal is not to reward the Iraqi government, but to relieve a morally unacceptable situation where innocent civilians suffer for the actions of a regime over which they have no control," the statement says.

<p>

The bishops also call for action to end the "systematic campaign of terror" being waged by the Sudanese government, and for more foreign aid and debt-forgiveness to mitigate "intolerable extremes of misery" in the Third World.

<p>

This is what a large number of "peaceniks" have been morally ostracized for saying: "no justice, no peace." The bishops statement quotes Pope Paul VI: "If you want peace, work for justice." 

<p>

Using ACTA's logic, the bishops' statement is anti-American. It's a scary specter - some American conservatives who talk the loudest about religious values attacking other Americans for taking their religion seriously.

<p>

As a boy, whenever I gave my mother some excuse as to why I didn't follow through on a tough task, she would ask, incredulously: "Sean, are you telling me you can't walk and chew gum at the same time?"

<p>

I don't think the rift in United We Stand has "peaceniks" on one side and 90 percent of America on the other. I see the debate as being between those who say we can walk and chew gum at the same time (international police action against terrorists plus the pursuit of social justice) and those who say we cannot, i.e. kill the terrorists at any cost and to hell with examining root causes.

<p>

Don't you think America is more than able to walk and chew gum at the same time?
