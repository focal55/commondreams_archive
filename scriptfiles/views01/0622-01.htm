What we see is what we get, or so the adage goes. But when we see 

the designs of mass media, what do we truly get? That's a troubling 

question for those who wonder what the constant barrages of media-generated 

images are doing to our lives.



         <p>Journalists who use words on the job are not the only media 

professionals who have cause to doubt the merits of their labors. The 

visual images that surround us -- whether on screens, printed pages, 

billboards, T-shirts or store shelves -- are the products of highly skilled 

designers, enormous amounts of money and state-of-the-art technology. 

Behind the images, some of the talent is growing vocally restless.



         <p>For a couple of years now, many designers and art directors have 

hotly debated "First Things First 2000," a global manifesto urging "a 

reversal of priorities in favor of more useful, lasting and democratic 

forms of communication -- a mindshift away from product marketing and 

toward the exploration and production of a new kind of meaning." The 

original signers, 33 prominent design professionals, have been joined as 

endorsers by hundreds of colleagues.



         <p>"Designers who devote their efforts primarily to advertising, 

marketing and brand development are supporting, and implicitly endorsing, a 

mental environment so saturated with commercial messages that it is 

changing the very way citizen-consumers speak, think, feel, respond and 

interact," the statement says.



         

<p>While assessing the arguments sparked by "First Things First," the 

latest issue of Adbusters magazine (<a href="http://www.adbusters.org" target="new">www.adbusters.org</a>) offers observations 

that are directly relevant to various aspects of the media industry. Today, 

we face "the desperate need to preserve a space for other forms of thinking 

and ways of being -- a protected zone free of the commercial inferno."



         <p>When dissident designers lament the impacts of prevalent visual 

images, their comments also apply to routine journalistic output. Rick 

Poynor, founding editor of the international journal Eye, puts it this way: 

"What we are rapidly losing sight of, in the rush to add seductive 

stylistic value to commercial goods and services and to transform life into 

a brand- and status-obsessed shopping spree, is the idea that design, as a 

way of thinking about systems, structures and relationships -- large and 

small, conceptual and visual -- could have uses other than commercial 

promotion."



         <p>Visual design, Poynor suggests, "might also be an imaginative tool 

for solving non-commercial problems; for shaping a sustainable environment 

and an equitable public realm; for encouraging democratic participation and 

new kinds of social interaction; for expressing ideas, values and ways of 

feeling that originate down below, among ordinary people -- us! -- in our 

own neighborhoods, from our own concerns." Creative design could be used 

"in service to our collectively determined community needs, not just to 

deliver top-down fashion diktats and purchasing imperatives from megacorp 

boardrooms and conquer-the-world marketing teams."



         <p>Privatization of public space -- from sports stadiums and museums 

to buses, classrooms and "public broadcasting" -- has been on an insidious 

bender for decades. We become accustomed to what was once unthinkable, and 

the trend moves in only one direction. Public reclamation of corporately 

privatized space is rare. Big money commonly rolls over other concerns.



         <p>Reversing such momentum would mean reclaiming truly public areas 

while banishing the endless panoplies of logos, branded concessions and 

investor-driven joint ventures. But even when no commercial interests seem 

to be involved, the heavy hand of capital often provides a strong tilt, 

with key media outlets continuously inflicting their relentless priorities 

on the public.



         <p>So, simultaneously, on one afternoon in late June, the hosts of 

programs airing on CNN and MSNBC were talking about the by-now-famous 

incident in San Jose when a man flung a dog named Leo into oncoming 

traffic. Ostensibly about a murdered pooch, the coverage reflected the 

ability of profit-fixated networks -- owned by companies like AOL Time 

Warner, Microsoft and General Electric -- to focus national attention on 

psychodramas like the gruesome demise of a doggie.



         <p>This enormous power to subject the American public to serial 

triviality is far from trivial. It has everything to do with the leverage 

exerted by multibillion-dollar media conglomerates as they skew the words 

and images undergoing mass distribution.



         <p>We're told that the public's appetite for human interest stories 

about crime and punishment is insatiable. But most of all, the latest 

breathless news sagas are cases of force-feeding. Crammed down the throats 

of the public, the scoops and scandals of the day seldom tell us anything 

about dominant power structures and ongoing inequities while we consume the 

latest frothy media sensations.

syndicated column focuses on media and politics.</i>
