Since September 11, the media have rushed to write obituaries for the

movement against corporate globalization.



<p>Don't believe everything you read.



<p>The movement is alive and kicking.



<p>While media commentators have rushed to bury the global justice

movement, the many strands of the movement against corporate

globalization have been busy organizing, campaigning, lobbying,

demonstrating -- and, frequently, winning.



<p>* As the world's trade ministers huddled in Doha, Qatar last month in an

effort to fashion agreement to launch a new round of World Trade

Organization (WTO) negotiations, activists around the world demonstrated

against the trade organization. In place of a new round of negotiations,

the protesters demanded the WTO's power be curtailed or the institution

abolished altogether.



<p>In the United States, demonstrators hit the streets in Washington, D.C.,

Chicago, Harrisburg, Madison, Wisconsin, New York City, Philadelphia,

San Francisco, Sacramento.



<p>Even more impressively, protests and meetings were held across the globe

-- in Australia, Austria, Bangladesh, Bolivia, Brazil, Canada (in a

dozen cities), the Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany (in

more than two dozen towns), Honduras, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia,

Italy, Japan, Lebanon, Malaysia, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Nigeria,

Norway, the Philippines, Russia, Slovakia, South Korea, Spain, Sweden,

Switzerland, Thailand, Tunisia, Turkey and the UK. In Thailand, more

than 1,500 farmers, union members and HIV/AIDS activists called for the

WTO to get out of agriculture and medicines.



<p>* In Doha itself, the campaign to promote access to essential medicines

in poor countries scored a significant victory. Fortified by protests in

recent years from HIV/AIDS activists and a torrent of technical

information from advocacy groups, the developing countries extracted

from the rich countries a pledge that "the TRIPS Agreement [the WTO's

intellectual property agreement] does not and should not prevent Members

from taking measures to protect public health." All WTO countries joined

in "affirm[ing] that the Agreement can and should be interpreted and

implemented in a manner supportive of WTO Members' right to protect

public health and, in particular, to promote access to medicines for

all."



<p>This declaration will provide developing countries with the political

space they need to begin introducing generic versions of on-patent

medicines, including drugs to treat HIV/AIDS. Because generics are

priced dramatically below the brand-name companies' products, the result

may be that millions gain access to life-saving treatment they would

otherwise be denied.



<p>* On November 13, a coalition of environmental organizations, including

Forest Ethics and the Dogwood Alliance, coordinated a day of action

against Staples, featuring more than 200 demonstrations at Staples

stores. The protesters demanded the company stop selling paper made from

endangered forests and switch to recycled sources.



<p>Staples -- which, according to the environmental groups, says that 97

percent of the paper it sells come from forests -- has responded to the

Stop Staples campaign by introducing some recycled paper lines in its

stores and sponsoring America Recycles Day.



<p>The message from activists: "Staples must get out of the business of

destroying forests," says Forest Ethics' Todd Paglia. "Putting a couple

new recycled products on the shelves and buying their way into America

Recycles Day doesn’t save forests."



<p>* On November 20, thousands massed in the streets of Ottawa for a

militant demonstration against the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and

World Bank.



<p>Following September 11, the two institutions cancelled the meetings they

had scheduled for late September in Washington, D.C. -- where they would

have been greeted by tens of thousands of demonstrators demanding open

meetings, debt cancellation for poor countries, an end to structural

adjustment, and the elimination of lending for socially and

environmentally dangerous projects, like oil, mining, gas and large

dams.



<p>When the institutions rescheduled scaled-down meetings with little

notice, activists in Ottawa mobilized on the fly -- again showing that

the proponents of corporate globalization that there is nowhere they can

hide. When they meet, the people will take to the streets.



<p>* This week, the Republican leadership in the House of Representatives

is pushing a vote on fast track, which would give the president

unbridled negotiating authority to expand NAFTA to all of the Americas,

as well as the power to negotiate other bilateral and multilateral

treaties that will drag down living standards in the United States and

around the world.



<p>But a coalition of labor, environmentalists, consumer groups and many

others has out-organized the Big Business interests supporting fast

track. As of this writing, it appears fast track -- if indeed the vote

is held -- will be defeated.



<p>[And to make sure that's so, U.S. residents should call their Member of

Congress at 1-800-393-1082 (just give your zip code, and you will be

connected to your representative) and urge them to vote "no" on fast

track.]



<p>This is just a small sampling of the global justice movement's

accomplishments in the last month.



<p>The tens of thousands who turn out for its major demonstrations are just

the most visible manifestation of a movement that continues to gain

strength. The global justice movement is a majoritarian movement, in the

United States and around the world. There will be more major

mobilizations in the months and years ahead, but there will also be more

coordinated international days of action, more boycotts, more pressure

campaigns, more lobbying -- and more victories. Not only does this

movement have staying power, it is going to win.
