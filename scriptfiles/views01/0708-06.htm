The Fourth of July is a time we bring out the flag, the fireworks and watch parades.

<P>We also have family picnics and we think about how much we love our country and our family. As I was thinking about both this week, it occurred to me there are many similarities between being citizens in a democracy and being parents.

<P>Once you are a parent you can be a good parent or a bad parent, but you can&#039;t be a nonparent. Citizenship is the same. You can be a good citizen or a bad citizen, but you can&#039;t be a noncitizen.

<P>A loving parent doesn&#039;t always let children do everything they want to do. If a child is about to run in front of a car or jump into deep water when she can&#039;t swim, we stop her. We don&#039;t let a child do things that will endanger other members of the family. We use all the resources and wisdom we have to help children develop and live a valuable, happy life. We don&#039;t always succeed, but being a good parent requires that we try.

<P>A good citizen has the same responsibility toward his or her country. We are responsible for what our country does. If our leaders are moving in a dangerous or dishonorable direction, we have an obligation either to persuade them to change or replace them.

<P>Parents are responsible not just for caring for their children, but for teaching children to act responsibly toward their siblings and community. In the same way, it is our responsibility as citizens to be sure that the actions of our country do not endanger other countries in the family of nations.

<P>Just as our children sometimes mislead us, so do our leaders. That is why the Founding Fathers placed so much importance on freedom of the press. They knew that citizens need to be well informed to serve their role as policy-makers.

<P>As citizens, we must decide what kind of a country we want the United States to be. I grew up knowing a country that was courageous during the Depression and World War II. We instituted protections to prevent a recurrence of the Depression by regulating banks and corporations and instituting Social Security and other legislation to protect individuals during hard times.

<P>After the war, we treated Japan and Germany with respect and helped them and the rest of Europe and Asia get back on their feet. We made friends with our enemies and had the love and respect of our own citizens as well as much of the rest of the world.

<P>We began working on some of our problems at home and made real progress against discrimination based on race, sex, class and disabilities. We expanded the franchise and made participating in democracy more available. We became more aware of our need to protect the environment. We helped create the United Nations and the World Court.

<P>When our country became involved in Vietnam, we educated ourselves about the war and forced our leaders to change our policy. When our president was guilty of malfeasance in office, we forced his resignation by legal means.

<P>The active participation of responsible citizen-patriots brought our country to the responsible position it has in the world today. But the price of freedom is eternal vigilance. And today there are new policies we need to understand and challenge.

<P>At a time when globalization of our economies needs international supervision, we have neglected our support for the United Nations. At a time when business and banking powers are growing, we have weakened our democratic control of them by give up sovereign power to organizations like WTO and NAFTA. As globalization makes a worldwide perspective essential, we are turning our back on world public opinion.

<P>We seem to think we do not need the trust or respect of other nations.

<P>There is no evidence stronger than the military policies of the current administration. Our president has decided to unilaterally abrogate the anti-ballistic missile treaty to build a national defense system. Now he is seeking to renew testing of nuclear weapons. All this done over the objections of our own allies.

<P>Is this the kind of world we want our political leaders to create? Do we want to take the risk that a mistaken technician or a misguided leader will have the power to destroy the world as we know it in an instant? Do we want to increase the fear and hatred from other nations?

<P>History is full of stories of countries that became so ambitious they sowed the seeds of their own destruction.

<P>Think carefully about what kind of a country you want the United States to be. It is up to us, as citizens, to choose the path our country takes. As patriots and as parents we show our love best by the responsible care we take of those we love.
