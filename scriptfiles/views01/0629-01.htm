Greg Mello, director of a Los Alamos National Laboratory watchdog group, is trying to convince citizens to buy 45,000 cans of food - from peas to pork-n-beans - dressed up to look like drums of nuclear waste and then mail the cans to Gov. Gary Johnson.

<p>The labels will also ask Johnson to convince his staff to shut down Area G, the laboratory's personal nuclear dump where about 45,000 drums of waste are buried each year.

<p> A study several years ago showed so much waste was going to Area G that it contained more than the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant, the nation's official repository for nuclear waste in southeastern New Mexico, ever will.

<p> The 100-acre site on a mesa top in Los Alamos contains about 10 million cubic feet of low-level radioactive and chemical waste. The dump - with its sprawling white tents that protect unburied waste from the elements - is visible from high-elevation roads as far away as Truchas.

<p> Mello drew a parallel between his campaign and two common bumper stickers - the first asks drivers to "Visualize World Peace." A bumper sticker, apparently created in response, says: "Visualize Whirled Peas."

<p> Mello says the <a href="http://www.lasg.org/hmpgfrm_b.html" target="new">Los Alamos Study Group</a> is taking those messages to heart.

<p> "We have to go a lot farther than visualizing whirled peas," he said. "So as it turns out, we're selling them."

<p> The lab is proposing further expansion of the Area G dump, possibly to accept waste created by a proposed pit-production facility and a 

 new plutonium facility.

<p> Los Alamos is the national laboratory that is slated to be in charge of producing the nation's pits, the fissioning core of a nuclear bomb, which contain plutonium-239 and toxic metals such as beryllium.

<p> The new facilities could create thousands more pounds of nuclear waste each year, Mello said.

<p> At a press conference Thursday, Mello said his "CAN-paign" is intended to shut down the on-site dump so that Los Alamos lab is forced to pay more attention to how much radioactive waste it generates during its nuclear-weapons work.

<p> Instead, Mello said he hopes the governor and the state environment department force LANL to come up with plans for minimizing their creation of waste before they are allowed to build.

<p> "We want to send the message: No new toys until you clean up your mess," Mello said.

<p> Also, he said, the cans come with information about how much waste the lab generates.

<p> "Not many people know we are dumping that much in Northern New Mexico," he said.

<p> Shari Kulanu, project coordinator for the canned-food campaign, said she is looking for businesses willing to sell the canned "waste" in their stores.

<p> The cans are selling individually for $3 each; in bulk, they can be purchased for $2 each.

<p> The cans each have a space for a stamp; the U.S. Postal Service has confirmed it will mail the cans for $3.50 postage. The study group is asking that the governor eventually turn over the canned food to a food bank.

<p> Diane Kinderwater, Johnson's spokeswoman, did not return a telephone message left Thursday seeking comment on what the governor's office will do with that much canned food.
