            Israeli officials have now publicly acknowledged a policy of &quot;targeted 

            attacks&quot; on Palestinians believed to be involved in terrorism. 

            These are planned assassinations, quite rightly called &quot;criminal 

            acts ... murder&quot; by Moshe Neghi, a respected Israeli journalist, 

            and denounced by Israeli peaceniks.

            <p>Deputy Defense Minister Ephraim Sneh said on the radio that the 

              policy was unequivocal. &quot;If anyone has committed or is planning 

              to carry out terrorist attacks, he has to be hit. ... It is effective, 

              precise and just.&quot;

            <p>The government gives no details. Some Israeli peace activists say 

              there have been eight or nine of these killings. Some Palestinians 

              say the figure so far is 20 or 30. It is not known who gives the 

              order - the chief of intelligence, the secret police, the defense 

              minister, the prime minister? In any case, there is no kind of judicial 

              process, no charge and no defense.

            <p>This is the latest revelation of the damage that the festering 

              war with the Palestinians has done to Israel, and the division it 

              is imposing on its people.

            <p>For reasons of moral conviction, Israeli criminal justice has no 

              death penalty. The only exception was Adolf Eichmann, the planner 

              and organizer of Nazi death camps, after a long and well publicized 

              trial.

            <p>There is no way to reconcile this policy of deliberate official 

              murder, without appeal and unaccountable, with Israel's founding 

              principles of democracy and rule of law.

            <p>Palestinian killings, whether random terrorism or premeditaded 

              vengeance, are equally despicable, but in no way can they justify 

              Israelis' violation of their own laws, their own sense of a moral 

              society.

            <p>It shows how very badly the Jewish state has come to suffer from 

              its interminable fight with the other people who claim the same 

              land, how much it has to lose by refusing to compromise.

            <p>This policy shows what sort of development might be expected if 

              Ariel Sharon wins election as prime minister on Feb. 6, as polls 

              indicate is likely.

            <p>Mr. Sharon is probably right when he argues that the current violence 

              was provoked by the fear of diehards (but on each side) of an unacceptable 

              peace after Camp David. But he is certainly wrong that a relatively 

              calm status quo can be restored by abandoning the idea of a permanent 

              settlement in the foreseeable future. The Palestinians are not going 

              to sit back and wait, and Israeli force, all the more under his 

              ruthless intransigence, will escalate the violence.

            <p>Already in 1996, Israeli intelligence assassinated a Palestinian 

              bomb expert known as &quot;The Engineer&quot; by booby trapping 

              his mobile phone. That did not stir any particular sense of shame 

              on the Israeli side because the man was seen as a dangerous enemy.

            <p>What has sparked a new outrage, at least among a quite limited 

              group of peace activists, is the killing of Thabet Thabet, a middle-aged 

              dentist, by Israeli soldiers using long-range machine guns as he 

              left his home on New Year's Eve. He was well-known to Israelis trying 

              to promote reconciliation with Palestinians, but the military considered 

              him a terrorist.

            <p>His widow has filed a petition to the Israeli Supreme Court to 

              rule that such &quot;orders to execute people without trial&quot; 

              are illegal. Is it naive, an appeal of desperation or a propaganda 

              maneuver to expose Israeli hypocrisy? In any case, it is important 

              to bring before the public this conflict of how Israelis see their 

              issues of security and justice.

            <p>According to the Washington Post correspondent Keith Richburg, 

              the policy was expanded to target planners of violence when the 

              attempt to pick off known troublemakers from amid crowds of stone-throwers 

              led to criticism for excessive force, including killing children. 

              Nor did the ensuing policy of attacking Palestinian police and official 

              buildings with helicopter missiles have the desired effect.

            <p>Whatever it does to Israel's image in the world, this assassination 

              policy is obviously not going to inspire thoughts of peace or new 

              submission among Palestinians. And it can only undermine Israelis' 

              confidence in their own righteousness.

            <p>President Bill Clinton has been trying with all the wit and wile 

              at his command to press for the beginning of an agreement at least 

              so as to revive some hope for the embattled populations. He will 

              probably fail, which won't hurt him; he has done his best. But it 

              is frightening to contemplate what lies ahead in this region. The 

              poison is virulent.
