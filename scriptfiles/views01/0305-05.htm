A fairy tale?  Consider America’s “Goldilocks economy,” neither too hot 

(inflation) nor cold (unemployment) of the Clinton era.  But that was then.  

Today, President Bush is working to keep Goldilocks running and hiding from 

the Three Bears, economically speaking.



<p>Economist Jim Devine writes: “The problem (for the American economy), of 

course, is the Three Bears: 1. Papa Bear: the steep rise of U.S. external 

indebtedness. 2. Mama Bear: the steep rise of U.S. consumer indebtedness.  

3. Baby Bear: the increased indebtedness of non-financial corporations.”



<p>Take Papa Bear: America’s nearly $370 billion trade deficit in 2000, the 

imbalance between what Americans bought and sold worldwide.  Americans have 

been borrowing to buy foreign goods on the cheap, Devine adds.  From where 

does this money originate?  During a two-year period ending in December 

1998, America’s financial debt to foreign lenders tripled to $1.5 trillion, 

according to the Financial Markets Center.



<p>Strikingly, this imbalance in the U.S. economy hasn’t exactly been front 

page news.  What is now on page one is President Bush’s proposed budget plan 

of reductions in federal taxes and the national debt.  His policy sounds 

spartan.  Yet it misdirects the American people’s attention from the 

financial fragility of the nation’s economic expansion.



<p>According to Robert Blecker of the Economic Policy Institute, “In fact, the 

U.S. economy’s current prosperity rests on the fragile foundations of a 

consumer spending boom based on a domestic stock market bubble, combined 

with foreign bankrolling of the U.S. trade deficit. If present trends 

continue, the growth in the U.S. international debt will not be sustainable 

in the long run. No country can continue to borrow so much from abroad 

without eventually triggering a depreciation of its currency and a 

contraction of its economy. The rising trade deficit and mushrooming foreign 

debt are thus warning signals of underlying problems that—if not 

corrected—could bring the U.S. economic boom crashing to a halt in the 

not-too-distant future.”



<p>Could there be a lesson from the remarkable growth of the East Asian “tiger 

economies” before they crashed in summer 1997? The nations of East Asia 

flourished on foreign debt. In this respect, East Asia’s past prosperity 

resembles the U.S. economy of the Clinton era. However, there are important 

differences, Devine cautions. Here’s one: America can repay its 

international debts with dollars. The East Asian nations couldn’t use their 

currencies to pay foreign lenders.  The consequences have been dreadful for 

the vast majority of the East Asian population.



<p>Which brings us to Mama Bear.  “The household sector’s outstanding debt has 

nearly doubled since 1990,” Jane D’Arista observes.  Workers borrow to make 

up for falling or stagnant wages, which have just begun to rise. “The recent 

gain in wages is a welcome reversal of long-term wage decline, but most 

working families are still playing catch-up,”  economist Jared Bernstein 

notes. The U.S. minimum wage of $5.15 per hour helps drive the wage gap. 

Workers’ lost ground has led to the wealthiest one percent of Americans now 

owning more wealth than the bottom 90 percent.



<p>Changing relations between American employers and employees also help fuel 

wage inequality. Private and public employers cut the wages and benefits of 

employees, especially entry-level workers.  Cases in point are their lower 

starting benefit packages and salaries.



<p>Public and private employers also cut their employees’ wages with unstable 

work. A study at UC San Francisco found that in 1999, “only a third of 

California workers have ‘traditional jobs’—that is, single, permanent, 

full-time, day-shift work paid for by an employer at the employer’s site.”  

Part-time, contract, and other non-full-time workers represent 10% of the 

work force nationwide, the Wall Street Journal reports.



<p>Debt-financed spending has another consequence.  Over-borrowing causes 

under-saving for the working majority.  The 1990s was the decade of debt for 

many working Americans.  As a result, many of them have too little savings 

for emergency situations.



<p>What of additional interest-rate cuts by the Fed?   All things being equal, 

this monetary policy may well encourage more household debt.  U.S. consumers 

are already at debt’s door.



<p>On to Baby Bear. Corporate America is also caught in the debt trap.  

“American firms, for example, have bought back a net $2.7 trillion-worth [of 

corporate stock] in the past five years. Many of these purchases are 

financed not with retained profits but with debt, thus increasing firms’ 

leverage and reducing their creditworthiness,” the London Economist reports.



<p>“The reason why corporate debt is the Baby Bear is that compared to consumer 

debt and external debt, it’s relatively minor,” Devine explains.  “However, 

when and if a recession comes it will hurt sales, cash flow, and profits, 

making the importance of corporate debt soar. A recession makes Baby Bear 

mature quickly. It encourages corporate bankruptcies (or government 

bail-outs), much larger lay-offs than even during the last three months, 

efforts to cut wages and benefits and to speed up work. It also discourages 

any new accumulation of debt—and thus new investment in factories and 

equipment.  It makes the recession worse.”



<p>The Three Bears are hungry.  Plus, they’ve never won a contest for denying 

themselves food.  Will America’s “Goldilocks economy” be their next meal?  

We shall see.
