WASHINGTON -- Of all the sad things about the furious fight over drilling in the Arctic, the saddest, perhaps, is that it didn't need to happen.
<p>Adoption of the simplest, pain-free strategies that have been test-marketed in California, where there really was an energy crisis, would have eliminated the need for disturbing the peace of the caribou that live in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, as well as that of Americans who do not agree with George W. Bush and his oil bidness friends that the planet is for pillaging.</p>
<p>It is wrong to see the contest as a showdown over whether the caribou or the president stand more in need of protection -- Bush is notoriously prone to green accidents. He learned the hard way that environmentalists emphatically reject Vice President Cheney's dissing of conservation as a "private virtue," just not on the radar of the real men who run our country as a private preserve. Bush's polls went through the floor on this issue and scared him straight, although only in rhetoric.</p>
<p>California, a state deplored by Bush not just for its adamant adherence to the Democrats, but for its obsessive environmentalism, was faced with a summer of rolling blackouts and worse. But California pulled itself together and instituted fuel economies, which resulted in an 11 percent reduction in consumption.</p>
<p>Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., proudly reports that the most trifling changes, with no damage to the state's prized lifestyle, paid off big dividends. Putting off the use of appliances during peak hours (4 p.m. to 6 p.m.) was the beginning. Setting the thermostat on air conditioners to 78, as Gov. Gray Davis fervently urges, has helped.</p>
<p>Anna Aurelio, of the U.S. Public Interest Research Group, says there are other equally modest moves that would yield energy savings equivalent to millions of barrels of oil: among them, inflating automobile tires to capacity to improve engine performance.</p>
<p>The Bush administration prefers to go the fossil fuel route, which is much preferred by the CEOs, and to the revival of nuclear energy, even though it hasn't yet figured out what to do with the toxic waste.</p>
<p>What Bush and his helpers in the White House overlooked, plainly, is that the people of California, far from feeling imposed upon, were glad to pitch in and help. Americans like to solve problems; it is in their blood. The idea of being able to do something about something is deeply gratifying. Ill health and heartbreak often can't be remedied, but turning up the thermostat and washing the dishes later strike people as small prices to pay for the common good.</p>
<p>But George W. Bush lives in a bubble. He wants to be right with the right wing of his party; his audience is the Fortune 500 CEOs, who gave big bucks to his campaigns and expect to be rewarded with the tax breaks and subsidies found in Bush's energy program.</p>
<p>Like his other enterprises, notably foreign policy, Bush's energy approach is highly personal, arbitrary and shortsighted. In foreign policy, he seems to go by aversions and crushes. Leading the aversions are our European allies, who unaccountably fail to applaud his national missile defense (NMD), which is the alpha and omega of his worldview. He made it clear that he couldn't stand Kim Dae Jung, the president of South Korea, whose vision of peace with North Korea complicates the rationalizations for the NMD, North Korea having been cited as a reliable source of an unannounced missile.</p>
<p>On the other hand, he's a fan of Vladimir Putin, the ex-KGB president of Russia, whose soul he glimpsed at their first meeting. His new soulmate is in accord with the Bush view of the ABM Treaty, which some people regard as the last standing pillar of arms control and which Bush and Putin see as no big deal.</p>
<p>In the Bush way of life, there is no room for participatory democracy, a euphemism for the common people's failure to mind their own business. He prefers to leave the heavy lifting to Uncle Dick Cheney, the country club and the Pentagon. It was a phenomenon that drove Richard Nixon crazy during the Vietnam War. Bush asks nothing of the electorate -- no sacrifices, no deep thinking about the character or direction of the country. The good citizen, to him, is the quiet citizen who kicks back and enjoys his tax rebate check, loves his SUV and hang the gas mileage, and turns down his thermostat so the temperature in his family room rivals that of the Arctic.</p>
<p>George W. Bush's ideal citizen doesn't read a lot of books -- that's for the little woman, and she can worry about arsenic in drinking water, too. Civic spirit is the last thing Bush is looking for. </p>
<p>It's too bad, because there's a lot of it around, just waiting to be summoned, as he would know if he got out of his bubble and noticed that young people are doing unprecedented amounts of community work and expect nothing in return but the satisfaction of having done something worthwhile.</p>
