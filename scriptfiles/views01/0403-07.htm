We've long accepted as a truism that freedom of the press exists mostly

for those who can afford to buy one.



<p>But we assumed that a corollary was that the freedom extended as well to

those who could afford to rent one, and buy ads.



<p>That may not be so.



<p>Consider the recent experience of Forest Ethics, a Berkeley,

California-based advocacy group that works to protect the ancient

rainforests of British Columbia and endangered forests of North America by

redirecting U.S. markets toward ecologically sound alternatives.



<p>Campaigns run by coalitions that include Forest Ethics, Rainforest Action

Network American Lands Alliance, Forest Action Network, Student

Environmental Action Coalition, Earth First!, Greenpeace, Sierra Club, the

Natural Resources Defense Council and many others have pressured Home

Depot and other major wood sellers to stop selling wood products from

old-growth forests. As a result, the timber industry is on the run.



<p>The recalcitrant members of the American Forest & Paper Association have

responded to forest activists' successful campaigns and the shifting

market for wood by creating their own certification system, the

Sustainable Forestry Initiative (SFI). Forest campaigners say SFI is a

sham, and are urging wood buyers to give preference to wood certified by

the Forest Stewardship Council, an independent organization.



<p>To highlight its concerns with the SFI, Forest Ethics decided to place an

advertisement in the Seattle Times during the Green Building Conference, a

recent meeting held in Seattle that attracted major U.S. homebuilders.



<p>The group's proposed ad mocked the SFI's claim to represent a "bold

approach to sustainable forest management" with a picture of an ancient

temperate rainforest clearcut in British Columbia by the Interfor company,

which SFI recently certified as "sustainable." Asking whether SFI was

promoting green wood or a greenwash, the Forest Ethics ad also criticized

the SFI certification of Boise Cascade. "SFI's endorsement of Boise

Cascade, the largest logger of old growth in the U.S., is further evidence

of SFI's toothless standards," the ad's text read.



<p>The Seattle Times refused to run the ad.



<p>The sticking point, according to Todd Paglia, Forest Ethics campaigns

director, was the mention of Interfor and Boise Cascade.



<p>As an aside, we should mention that we are generally not fans of issue

advertisements, which we think far too often drain advocacy groups'

budgets for little payback, and are a poor substitute for grassroots

organizing. But the ads tend to be most effective when used as part of a

larger campaign and with the specific purpose of singling out and shaming

a particular company or corporate executive.



<p>That is exactly what Forest Ethics intended. Paglia says the Seattle Times

offered that the group could run the ad so long as corporations were not

mentioned by name. But "at that point, the ad is worthless," Paglia says.



<p>And so the ad didn't run.



<p>The Seattle Times disputes Paglia's version of events. Lloyd Stull,

national sales manager for the paper, says the Seattle Times only

requested documentation to support Forest Ethics' assertions. Paglia

insists that the paper was uninterested in either documentation for its

claims that the companies' are clearcutting or in suggesting word changes

to avert libel concerns.



<p>In any case, we checked on the claims directly. Spokespersons for Interfor

and Boise Cascade readily acknowledge the companies are clearcutting. We

were not able on short notice to definitively determine whether Boise

Cascade is the number one old-growth logger in the United States.



<p>Meanwhile, Forest Ethics directed its attention to the East Coast, and

sought to place an ad in the Boston Globe targeting Staples, the office

supply company.



<p>"The ugly truth is that thousands of acres of forest are needlessly

destroyed every year to supply Staples with cheap, disposable paper

products," the proposed ad said.



<p>It urged readers to "call Tom Stemberg [Staples' CEO] at 508-253-7143 and

ask him to stop destroying our forests, or send him a fax at

www.StopStaples.com. And when Staples tells you they sell hundreds of

recycled products, know that in truth 97 percent of their copy paper comes

from clearcut forests."



<p>To Paglia's surprise, the Boston Globe refused to run the ad. Taking out

the phone information was not enough to satisfy the paper -- the Globe

refused to run an ad that mentioned Staples by name. Dennis Lloyd, an

advertisement manager at the paper, says only that the paper was not

comfortable with the way Forest Ethics "expressed" its views in the ad.



<p>The New York Times, by contrast, says that it will run opinion ads so long

as they do not constitute libel. A Times representative says the paper

would have no problem with the substance of the Staples ad and the mention

of the company's name.



<p>In recent weeks, right-winger David Horowitz has generated a storm of

controversy by seeking to place ads in college newspapers opposing

reparations for the descendants of slaves and being refused by some

college outlets.



<p>Here's what the Boston Globe had to say about the controversy: "The ideas

against slavery reparations contained in an advertisement placed in

student newspapers around the country may well be insulting to minorities

on campus. But they are only ideas. Far more dangerous than offensive

ideas is their censorship, because censorship knows no ideology and will

Eventually muzzle the views of the minorities as well."



<p>So why the double standard? The Globe should be consistent and carry the

Forest Ethics ad. The paper's refusal to carry truthful advertisements

criticizing corporations mocks the spirit of the First Amendment and the

notion that the press will serve as an institutional check on abuses of

power.
