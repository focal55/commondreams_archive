TREASURY Secretary Paul O'Neill defended President Bush's $1.6 trillion tax cut in a way that brazenly captured America's grubby garishness. Two weeks ago O'Neill said the cut will put ''more money back into the hands of people who will buy homes and cars and bigger homes and bigger cars.''

<P>

<P>On the face of it, it is disgusting to consider that the tax cut is simply so a nation already obese in waist and wallet can snort ever more as a hog going to slaughter the environment. The United States now has 214 million motor vehicles, nearly one for every woman, man, and child. At 5 percent of the world's population, we consume about 25 percent of the world's oil. A recent Associated Press feature said that if the whole world consumed oil as does America, with roads full of sports utility vehicles, Earth's oil reserves would be gone in 10 years.

<P>

<P>Houses are becoming another SUV. As the average size of households has shrunk from 3.27 people in 1966 to 2.62, the average size of the American home has grown 50 percent since 1970, from 1,500 square feet to 2,260 square feet. Suburban-sprawl dream homes commonly surpass 5,000 square feet.

<P>

<P>With such space, televisions have mutated from 19-inch sets to earthquake home theaters with screens wider than a car. In a story in the Palm Beach Post, home consultants now wire a house so ''residents can use an Internet home page from everywhere in the world to turn on the lights, control the temperature, turn on audio or video equipment, start the microwave, or even flush a toilet. The refrigerator will notice when the beer supply is low and order a case for next-day delivery.''

<P>

<P>Bigger cars. Bigger houses. Refrigerators that can call the liquor store to say, ''It's Miller time!'' If the tax cut were merely a testament to America's selfishness, that would be bad enough. In pushing for the tax cut, Bush said we ''have met our needs.'' Never mind the still-emaciated public schools or the pork rinds of health care for the working poor who cannot get the care Vice President Dick Cheney is receiving for his heart.

<P>

<P>Recent events raise a more haunting possibility. As cars and houses become bigger, we may be losing our children in them. 

<P>

<P>There was the school killing of two students and the wounding of 13 others in a San Diego suburb by a 15-year-old boy. A 14-year-old girl shot a classmate in the shoulder in a parochial school in Williamsport, Pa., the home of the Little League World Series. Students in Philadelphia, St. Petersburg and Bradenton, Fla., Covington, Wash., and Elm Grove, Wis., were arrested with guns, several of them loaded.

<P>

<P>A husband and wife in Indianapolis were charged with felony neglect when their 6-year-old daughter carried a loaded handgun into her kindergarten class. A grandfather in Minnesota was charged with endangerment when his 5-year-old granddaughter brought a loaded gun to school. Around the nation, in California, Michigan, Iowa, Virginia, Arizona, New Jersey, and Massachusetts, over 20 students were arrested or suspended in the last three weeks after making threats to shoot or bomb classmates.

<P>

<P>We can give our children computers and private bedrooms with skylights, but with those televisions delivering violent, vengeful entertainment in ever more digital detail, we must consider whether we are defeating our best intentions. It is obvious that when many of our boys and a few of our girls become angry, they no longer look for hugs from mommy or daddy.

<P>

<P>They look for a gun. No matter the size of the house, they can find one. According to the American Journal of Public Health, 35 percent of American homes have at least one gun. Of the homes with a gun, 43 percent have at least one lying around unlocked. According to federal data, the guns used by two-thirds of the 41 students involved in 37 school shootings since 1974 came from their own home or the home of a relative.

<P>

<P>Bigger cars. Bigger homes. Bush is the new Herbert Hoover. Instead of a car in every garage and a chicken in every pot, it is cars too big for a garage and massive houses where owners work so late, they are more likely to buy Kentucky Fried than cook their own bird.

<P>

<P>Bush has also promised a gun in virtually any hand that wants one. In our ever expanding homes where it is easier to lose track of our children and our weapons, that may be a big mistake. Refrigerators can now detect if the beer supply is low. Nowhere in these wired houses is an alarm that tells a parent, from anwhere in the world, if his or her child is touching a gun.
