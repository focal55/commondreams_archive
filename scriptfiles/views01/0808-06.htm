TUCSON, Ariz. -- I have little doubt that Arab nations, in their United Nations draft declaration, have a morally legitimate charge of racism against Israel. But what nation isn't tainted with racism today, including the U.S.?
<p> If a country as advanced as the United States has ongoing internal conflicts due to artificially created racial inequalities, what can one expect of less-advanced countries?
<p>
 

The truth is that the United Nations is crawling with racist nations. Each of those, from the newest to the oldest, practice racism.
<p> Economics is the most effective means used toward creating racial inequalities. And you can bet your bottom dollar that the United Nations organization itself, as the handmaiden of white developed nations, is no novice at economic racism.
<p> In fact, in global capitalism and control, which is what the United Nations is all about, economic exploitation of non-white underdeveloped nations is job one.
<p> Money is power. If non-white nations are kept down economically, you deprive them of power, while at the same time reaping economic benefits from the blood and sweat of their non-white masses.
<p> When the United Nations, and especially its developed member nations, stop economically exploiting underdeveloped countries, the world will see an obvious common sense beginning toward fighting racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance.
<p> It will also greatly mitigate the call for financial reparations by African nations, provide a basis for friendly relations between Arab countries and Israel, and take egregious hypocrisy out of international racial conferences.
<p>
