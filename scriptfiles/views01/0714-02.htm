PARIS -- President George W. Bush is making a clear effort to establish friendly relations with foreign leaders. And U.S. allies are trying to assure themselves of the good graces of the new administration, even when they disagree on policy, as on the missile defense issue. But it isn't easy. On question after question, the United States is moving to reject involvement in international agreements, simply because they are international.

<p>The latest example is the attempt to make rules that would limit the world trade in small arms and provide means to help monitor the traffic. John Bolton, undersecretary of state for arms control, told the United Nations conference on the subject that America wouldn't sign, in terms so blunt that The New York Times said the speech might as well have been delivered by Charlton Heston, who heads the national gun lobby.

<p>The pretext for refusal was that a pact might constrict the right of American citizens to bear arms, which is in no way under consideration. But the growing list of subjects that the United States has decided it doesn't want to settle with others suggests that the content of the agreements isn't what matters, it is the very idea of accepting rules devised to apply to everybody.

<p>Some of the issues, such as nuclear missile reduction, have a well established history of eager American participation. Some, like the traffic in small arms, are relatively new to diplomacy. Some, like the International Criminal Court, met U.S. resistance from the start.

<p>The campaign against the United Nations that reached its apex in the United States refusing to pay back dues for several years has waned. There are no longer regular speeches from congressmen about the dangers of multilateralism.

<p>But without so much emotive rhetoric, there is a straightforward withdrawal from proposals to organize an international approach to problem after problem, even when the United States has taken a leading role in identifying the evil. That is the case with the agreement to provide better controls on money laundering, worked out in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development with active American participation, and then opposed by Washington.

<p>Refusal to ratify the Kyoto agreement on limiting carbon dioxide emissions that contribute to global warming, refusal to ratify the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, refusal to accept a ban on land mines, are other cases of the United States opting out.

<p>On a number of questions, Washington says it isn't changing policy. It is still for cracking down on money laundering. It has strict rules of its own on small arms exports. It foresees important cuts in the U.S. nuclear arsenal without any negotiated obligation for Russia to match them. But it doesn't want to accept commitments that would put the United States on an equal level of policy obligation with other states.

<p>This isn't isolationism, but it is unilateralism to a high degree. To the others, it is the United States saying, &quot;Now we are the sole superpower, we don't have to obey the requirements that the rest of you accept.&quot;

<p>There is a widespread sense that the nations of the world need some better arrangement for dealing with what have become global issues than the unpredictable, often anarchic customs of the past.

<p>The United States has a record of leading the calls for a system of international relations that enhances the search for peace and joint problem-solving. It cannot seek to exempt itself.
