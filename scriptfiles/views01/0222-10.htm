So you fellas want to advertise your drug on TV?  Terrific!  In case you

didn't already know, there are different advertising standards for

different drugs.  Let me tell you about them. 

<p>



If your commercial is for a prescription pharmaceutical drug, it must

provide a fair assessment of the benefits and risks and describe the

side effects that can occur when the consumer uses the drug as

prescribed.  The Food and Drug Administration regulates these ads --

after they've gone out over the airwaves for a spell.  If an ad is

misleading, the FDA has the authority to yank it off the air.  But just

between you and me, as watchdogs go the FDA is on the sleepy side. 

Unless you tell a whopper it won't even bark, let alone bite. 

<p>



If you want to advertise the drug nicotine, the message must be 100

percent negative.  Some of the best sponsors on teen-oriented shows are

the anti-tobacco groups.  Governments give them big bucks to produce and

air commercials on the dangers of smoking and the wickedness of tobacco

executives.  That's only fair, considering for many years that networks

ran nothing but seductive ads that helped persuade millions of

youngsters to light up.  That wouldn't have been such a bad thing except

nicotine has one of the highest addiction rates. Now that wouldn't be

such a bad thing given that nicotine fiends, unlike crackheads and

alcoholics, aren't dangerous to themselves or others when under the

influence.  Of course, the long haul is another story:  One in three

smokers dies before his or her time, and that's reason enough to focus

solely on the downside. 

<p>



The networks also run ads by the tobacco companies themselves urging

youngsters not to smoke.  Mind you, they <i>want</i> youngsters to smoke. 

Companies know they gotta hook 'em early, because hardly anyone waits

till adulthood to give cigs a try.  No, these ads are an insurance

policy against future lawsuits:  They can say, "Didn't we warn you when

you were ten not to take up smoking?"  

<p>

One tobacco giant, Phillip Morris, also spends hundreds of millions on

ads to tell viewers about the million or two it spends to help women

battered by disturbed, drunken husbands and boyfriends. 

<p>



Now let's say you want to advertise a mind-altering, recreational drug. 

<p>



Boob-tube barons accept ads for illicit street drugs -- negative ads,

that is, produced for the White House Office of National Drug Control

Policy (ONDCP) by the Partnership for a Drug-Free America.  The

Partnership is a band of dedicated advertising and communication

professionals who donate their time and talents to warn youngsters about

the dangers of those drugs that don't enrich the advertising industry.  

<p>



The government has zero tolerance for balanced presentations of the

risks, benefits and side effects of marijuana, ecstasy, cocaine or

heroin.  You won't see any Tinseltown testimonials about coke being the

perfect pick-me-up after a hard day on the set.  The more negative the

ad, the better.  Why you can even imply that all illegal drugs are

equally dangerous.  For some strange reason most of these ads focus on

marijuana, which is the least dangerous mind-altering drug -- legal or

illegal.

<p>

The other recreational drug advertised on TV is alcohol.  Now alcohol is

alcohol, whether it comes in a shot of whiskey, a glass of wine or a can

of beer.  Nevertheless, the networks decided long ago not to accept ads

for liquor, only beer and wine.  Don't ask me why.  

<p>



A while ago I said it's the job of the FDA to require pharmaceutical

makers to describe the risks as well as the benefits of their drugs. 

Well, even though alcohol is a drug and the "D" in FDA stands for

"Drug," the FDA does not regulate ads for beer and wine.  Now that could

be because alcohol isn't as dangerous as Claritin.  No, wait a minute. 

It couldn't. 

<p>



Even though the "D" in ONDCP stands for "Drug," that office doesn't

regulate beer and wine ads.  Nor does ONDCP include alcohol in its

"anti-drug" ads.  Now that could be because alcohol isn't as dangerous

as marijuana or ecstasy.  No, wait a minute.  It couldn't.  Why even

Barry McCaffrey, the pot-obsessed former drug czar, calls alcohol the

"most destructive drug in America." 

<p>



Anyway, the Federal Trade Commission oversees alcohol advertising.  Did

I say oversees?   I meant overlooks.  Once in a blue moon it will take a

company to task for blatantly unfair or deceptive ads, but the FTC

believes "self-regulation" is best for brewers and wine merchants, who

couldn't agree more.  

<p>



The brewers drew up a hard-hitting voluntary code that permits them to

run ads on shows where 49.9 percent of viewers are under the drinking

age and to use humor and animated characters that appeal to kiddies --

so long as the humor and characters also appeal to 21-year-olds.  

<p>



Beer ads accentuate the positive.  Make no mistake, there is a positive

side:  It's a tasty beverage that gives shy guys the courage to talk to

pretty gals.  If you use good judgment you can enjoy it in good health

for a lifetime.  But somewhere in the ads you'd think a conscientious

corporation would insert the words "drug," "addictive" and "cirrhosis,"

or remind women that fetal alcohol syndrome is the leading cause of

birth defects.  Maybe tell kids and teens they can die from an overdose,

and that alcohol is a prime factor in the leading causes of death for

young people -- not just drunk driving, but drownings, falls, homicide

and suicide.  

<p>



Alcohol is, by far, our most widely abused mind-altering drug.  Yet beer

commercials give viewers the impression everybody drinks -- white guys

who throw sofas out of third-floor windows and black guys who say

"Whassup," not to mention dogs, frogs, lizards, lobsters, and beavers --

and no one ever develops a problem.   

<p>



Brewers are a lot like Norman Vincent Peale:  They believe in the power

of positive advertising. 

<p>



So, fellas, those are the standards.  Now which drug would you like to

push?
