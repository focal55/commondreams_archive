President Bush has just hired a guy who made headlines in the 1980s as a deceitful, scheming coddler of Latin American tyrants.

<p>

Elliott Abrams is a poster-boy for America&#0039;s shameful history of propping up dictators from Santiago to Mexico City - so long as they were anticommunist.

<p>

Two years ago, President Clinton went to Guatemala and vowed a clean break with this disgraceful legacy.

<p>

By installing Mr. Abrams at the National Security Council, President Bush seems to be saying: 

<p>Never mind.

<p>It is hard to imagine someone less suited to be the council&#0039;s senior director for democracy, human rights and international operations. Manuel Noriega? Don King? The hiring of Mr. Abrams - who makes Jesse Helms seem like a milquetoast - mocks the President&#0039;s saccharine pledge of civility.

<p>

Elliott Abrams was assistant secretary of state for Latin America for most of the Reagan years. In that role, this high official pooh-poohed the slaughter of civilians in war-torn El Salvador and Guatemala and mocked his critics as &quot;vipers&quot; and worse.<p>

He played an important role in the funding of contra rebels fighting to overthrow Nicaragua&#0039;s Sandinista government. He didn&#0039;t just try to end-run the U.S. law that prohibited U.S. military aid to the contras. He actively deceived three congressional committees about what was going on.<p>

Facing felony charges based on his testimony, Mr. Abrams pled guilty in 1991 to two misdemeanors and was sentenced to a year&#0039;s probation and 100 hours of community service.<p>

But a year later, President George H.W. Bush, whose own role in the Iran-contra scandal has remained murky, handed the uncontrite peddler of lies a full pardon.<p>

Elliott Abrams has no business being awarded any position of public trust.<p>

For this ethically challenged zealot to be given duties involving democracy and human rights - in an administration pledged to &quot;restore honor and dignity&quot; to the White House - is especially odious.<p>

Unfortunately, his appointment - a sop to the Republican right - doesn&#0039;t require approval by the Senate.

<p>

The President should realize his error and tell Mr. Abrams&#0039; most recent employer, the Washington-based Ethics and Public Policy Center, to take him back for more rehab.
