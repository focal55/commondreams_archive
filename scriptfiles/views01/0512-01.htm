THE GROWING worldwide demand for resources is threatening the world's environmental health to an unprecedented extent. Unless new policies are set in place, this situation could have devastating implications for human development. Significant among the possible options are massive campaigns, both at government and private levels, educating people about how critical the situation is for human survival and for everybody's quality of life.

<P>

<P>In this context, women and children can be very active participants in the defense of the environment and stop, or even reverse, the degradation of our natural resources.

<P>

<P>At a worldwide level, there is a growing awareness of the need to make women contribute to the identification of environmental problems as well as in the planning of activities geared at the sustainable development of their communities.

<P>

<P>Industrial processes have over the past 200 years been responsible for increasing levels of pollution and for the degradation of air, water, and land. In addition to unrestricted exploitation of natural resources, unsound agricultural practices have had devastating effects on the environment and  on people's health and quality of life. Women and children have been particularly affected.

<P>

<P>Women, especially those pregnant, are particularly susceptible to several environmental risks, particularly women living in rural or marginal suburban areas in developing countries. In those situations, women have few choices about the kind of lifestyle they want to lead and fewer opportunities to change unsatisfactory conditions and improve their families and their own health.

<P>

<P>Because of their roles as home-managers, economic providers, and their role in reproduction, women are susceptible to health problems and hazards in several situations. The reproductive system of pregnant women is especially vulnerable to environmental contaminants. Every step in the reproductive process can be altered by toxic substances in the environment. These toxic substances may increase the risk of abortion, birth defects, fetal growth retardation, and peri-natal death.

<P>

<P>Although for a long time women have been considered passive recipients of aid rather than active participants in development, their role is crucial both to the economies of the developing countries and to the future of the environment.

<P>

<P>In that regard, as environmental educators and motivators for change, women are key agents in the processes leading to a more sustainable and healthy development of the planet.

<P>

<P>Women are traditional protectors of the environment. A world survey on public attitudes on the environment sponsored by the United Nations Environment Program  showed that women, when compared with men, are more likely to choose a lower standard of living with fewer health risks rather than a higher standard of living with more health risks.

<P>

<P>The Platform for Action, adopted by the Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing in 1995, identified the need to involve women more actively in environmental decision making at all levels as well as to incorporate the gender perspective in all strategies leading to sustainable development.

<P>

<P>The active participation of women in think tanks and in environmental training activities is allowing them to educate both the public and policy makers about the critical link between women, natural resources and their use, and sustainable development.

<P>

<P>In that regard, women have better access to local environmental issues and how to approach them than men. Women have often had a leadership role in reducing unnecessary use of resources, promoting an environmental ethic, and recycling resources to minimize waste.

<P>

<P>There is growing evidence that women in several countries around the world are taking central roles in the grass-roots environmental movement. And there is increasing belief that development policies that do not involve women and men alike will not be successful in the long run.
