After a police officer shot Carlo Giuliani in the head, Time 

magazine published a requiem of sorts -- explaining that the 23-year-old 

Italian protester pretty much got what he deserved.



         <p>"One man died in Genoa; a man, we must presume, who was swayed by 

the false promise that violence -- not peaceful protest, not participation 

in the democratic process -- is the best way to advance a political cause," 

Time's article concluded. "It is not too much to hope that the next time 

his friends stoop to pick up a cobblestone, they will remember a lesson 

learned when plows first broke the Mesopotamian earth: You reap what you sow."



         <p>The sanctimonious tone, etched with gratification, was not unique 

to the largest newsmagazine in the United States. Quite a few commentators 

seemed to accept -- or even applaud -- the killing of Giuliani as rough 

justice. "Excuse me if I don't mourn for the young man who was shot dead by 

police during the economic summit," wrote Houston Chronicle columnist Cragg 

Hines. "It was tragic, but he was asking for it, and he got it."



         <p>In Genoa, assaults by Italian police were systematic and 

widespread, causing hundreds of serious injuries. But American news 

accounts tended to be cryptic. "Italian police raided a school building 

housing activists and arrested all 92 people inside," the Wall Street 

Journal reported on July 23. "Afterward, the building was covered with 

pools of blood and littered with smashed computers. Several reporters at 

the school were hurt; one had his arm broken. Police said 61 of the 

detainees had been wounded in riots that preceded the raid, but neighbors 

described hours of beatings and screaming coming from the school during the 

raid."



         <p>On July 25, when I called the Committee to Protect Journalists, 

the Manhattan-based group had not yet issued a statement. But program 

director Richard M. Murphy told me: "CPJ is extremely concerned by reports 

that working journalists were attacked by both police and protesters while 

covering street demonstrations at the Genoa summit." The comment was 

evenhanded to a fault. The vast majority of the reported attacks on 

journalists were by police.



         <p>Unlike colleagues assaulted while displaying press credentials, 

reporter John Elliott was on an undercover assignment among protesters. 

Watching a water cannon move through tear gas, "I felt a massive blow to 

the back of my head," he wrote in the Sunday Times of London. "For a second 

my vision whited out. I had been hit by a police truncheon."



         <p>As more police ran toward him, Elliott quickly tried to regain his 

journalistic identity by yelling, "Giornalista inglese!" But the clubbing 

went on. "Two policemen dragged me along the ground, shouted at me in 

Italian and then hit me some more. My cycling helmet disintegrated under 

their blows. Truncheons whacked my back, arms and shins. They dragged me 

over railway lines towards a signal box where I was ordered to put my head 

on a steel rail. I tried to obey, unable to believe this was happening. 

Gripped by fresh impulses of violence, they started kicking my head, back 

and legs. Repeatedly they pushed me to the ground for a fresh pasting."



         <p>News accounts routinely declared that the fatality in Genoa was 

unprecedented. But an essay in the London-based Guardian debunked that 

media myth. "The members of the Landless Movement of Brazil (MST) could 

tell you that Carlo Giuliani ... is not the first casualty of the movement 

challenging neoliberal globalization around the world," Katharine Ainger 

wrote. "The MST suffer ongoing persecution for their campaign for land 

reform in Brazil, their opposition to the World Bank's program of 

market-led land reform and to the corporate control of agriculture through 

patents on seed."



         <p>Ainger cited other deaths that have gone virtually unreported in 

mass media: "Recently, three students protesting against World Bank 

privatization were shot in Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea. Young men 

fighting World Bank-imposed water privatization have been tortured and 

killed in Cochabamba, Bolivia."



         <p>Meanwhile, around the planet, those who perish from lack of food 

or drinkable water or health care have little media presence. The several 

thousand children who die from easily preventable diseases each morning, 

and afternoon, and evening, remain largely media abstractions. When will 

news outlets really scrutinize the profit-driven violence that takes their 

lives?



         <p>While such institutionalized violence is massive and continuous, 

supporters of corporate globalizing agendas benefit from the propaganda 

value of the street violence by "Black Bloc" participants in Genoa (who, 

according to eyewitness accounts, comprised no more than 2 percent of the 

protesters there). It would be surprising if those Black Bloc units were 

not heavily infiltrated by government-paid provocateurs and the like. 

Historically, covert police agents have often pushed for -- and helped to 

implement -- violent actions in isolation from a mass base. In sharp 

contrast, there is scant record of police agents trying to foment militant, 

nonviolent civil disobedience on a large scale.



         <p>A global movement with literally millions of participants is 

continuing to organize against the colossal daily violence of the world's 

biggest institutions. Progressive websites that are genuinely grassroots 

and international -- like www.indymedia.org and www.zmag.org -- reflect 

vibrant resistance to a corporatized future. Other futures are possible, to 

the extent that people are determined to create them.
