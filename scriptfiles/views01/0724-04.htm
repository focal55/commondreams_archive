The bloodsoaked police raid on the headquarters of the Genoa protesters at the weekend yesterday prompted the accusation yesterday that the state had undermined its legitimacy by sanctioning brutality. 

<P>Evidence emerged that the assault early on Sunday morning, in which 61 people were injured, had been a vendetta by police officers seeking revenge for the rioting at the G8 summit.  

<P>Last night the parliamentary opposition demanded a commission of inquiry into the policing of the summit and the resignation of the interior minister, Claudio Scajola.  

<P>In a raucous debate, Mr Scajola and the prime minister, Silvio Berlusconi, tried to distance themselves from the raid on the headquarters of the Genoa Social Forum.  

<P>To guffaws of disbelief, they insisted that they did not know in advance that 200 police officers would attack the forum. More than a dozen of the 93 people arrested were carried out on stretchers.  

<P>"A pack of lies, responded Vittorio Agnoletto, a spokesman for the forum. "It was authorized butchery."  

<P>Political analysts questioned the government's claim that the head of the police force, Gianni De Gennaro, would have given the order without consulting the interior minister.  

<P>The forum has called for protests at police stations throughout the country today against what it called vicious, deceitful tactics.  

<P>An anarchist website warned of violent revenge for the death of Carlo Giuliani, 23, who was shot by police.  

<P>A letter bomb exploded in Verona, causing no injuries. Another device sent to Genoa's prefect was intercepted and defused.  

<P>For the duration of the raid Italy had been a state without law, said Fausto Bertinotti, leader of the Refounded Communists. "In these days things have happened which in my life I have never seen - never."  

<P>An interior ministry source admitted that the raid had turned into a revenge attack by police venting their frustration after two days of failing to control looting and thuggery.  

<P>Officially the operation has been called a success. The officers who stormed the two schools in which the forum had its headquarters found two Molotov cocktails, a nail   bomb, two sledgehammers, a pickaxe and 12 penknives.  

<P>The 93 who were arrested may be charged with criminal association, possession of explosives, resisting arrest and damage to public property.  

<P>A forum spokesman said the sledgehammers and pickaxe, which were covered in dust, had been left by workmen who had not yet finished building the school.  

<P>The knives were needed to open tins of food, and the homemade bombs were probably planted, he added.  

<P>But yesterday magistrates questioned why the carabinieri, the police force which is part of the army, had used inexperienced teenage conscripts.  

<P>The intelligence services allegedly terrified the conscripts with warnings that packets of HIV-infected blood infected would be thrown.  

<P>A cameraman said that protesters, fearing police ambushes, begged television crews to escort them to the railway station.  

<P>But the protesters may have lost the public relations battle. An opinion poll by Datamedia suggested that most Italians believed the police were too tolerant.
