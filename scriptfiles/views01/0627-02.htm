What is Vice President Dick Cheney trying to hide? In the spring,

when Cheney convened his energy task force, he sat down with executives

from the oil, electricity and nuclear power industries and kept it all

secret. He issued his report in May, but his fetish for secrecy about its

origins continues.

<p>The Government Accounting Office and two congressmen, Henry A. Waxman

(D-Los Angeles) and John D. Dingell (D-Mich.), are demanding that Cheney

tell the public who was on the task force and what was said. The vice

president is stonewalling.

<p>The GAO sent Cheney a letter a week ago stating that he was legally

obligated to come clean. The vice president's office claimed that its

response, including some requested documents, was already in the mail.

But the White House still refuses to divulge the names of the outside

consultants it relied upon, so the accounting office is threatening to

issue a "demand letter." It may even sue.

<p>When Hillary Clinton cobbled together her health care plan in the

early 1990s, she was rightly attacked for avoiding public scrutiny. Bill

Clinton was a master of obfuscation during his presidency, regularly

denying Congress documents and files. Now the Bush White House is

following suit.

<p>Whenever government officials try to work in secret, they inevitably

end up drawing attention to what they're trying to conceal. Cheney's task

force was arguably more efficient because it worked in quiet, but his

stubborn refusal to release the names of those he consulted suggests that

the meetings themselves were a charade, designed to rubber-stamp the

wishes of his energy industry pals. It also suggests that the Bush White

House has picked up some tricks from its predecessor. So much for open

government.
