It appears that even Republicans are having a hard time coming 

              up with arguments in favor of President Bush&#146;s tax cut plan, 

              which even the White House now admits will direct the overwhelming 

              majority of benefits to the wealthiest Americans.

<P>With the president having acknowledged that roughly a quarter of 

              the tax cut will go directly into the pockets of the richest 1 percent 

              of Americans &#151; and that well over 50 percent of the largesse 

              will be delivered to folks with incomes over $100,000 a year &#151; 

              the Bush plan looks like the most radical redistribution of income 

              America has seen since King George III was shaking down the colonials.</P>

<P>Up against that reality, Bush backers are understandably hard-pressed 

              to come up with rationales for their boy&#146;s tax strategy. This 

              is definitely a case where honesty &#151; "We gave Bush a lot of 

              money for his campaign, and now he is going to restructure tax policy 

              so that we pay less while working people shoulder more of the burden" 

              &#151; just doesn&#146;t cut it.</P>

<P>Luckily, Republican loyalists in Wisconsin and other states don&#146;t 

              have to think. As part of a coordinated campaign to create the fantasy 

              that Bush&#146;s Robin-Hood-in-Reverse gambit has popular appeal, 

              members of the Wisconsin Republican e-mail list have been deluged 

              with promptings to write representatives and local papers.</P>

<P>As one recipient of the party&#146;s urgent e-mails put it when 

              she forwarded the sample letters, "Word must have come down from 

              the Bush team that the tax plan is really in trouble. ... I&#146;ve 

              gotten a ton of e-mails asking folks to write letters to the editor 

              and to call their congressfolks pleading to pass this thing."</P>

<P>Just how desperate the Bushistas are to sell their scheme is obvious 

              from the "sample" letters to the editor the GOP is urging partisans 

              to print out, sign and send. Here are some favorites:</P>

<P></P>

<P><i>Dear Editor: I did a double take the other night when President 

              Bush spoke to the nation. Here was a man who finally understands 

              what&#146;s important. He wants to double funding on medical research 

              on cancer and other diseases. He wants to pay off more government 

              debt than any other country in history. He wants to make our schools 

              better and our streets safer. And he wants to let me keep more of 

              my money in the form of a tax cut. Only those who make a conscious 

              choice to live in the past could overlook what President Bush wants 

              to do for our future.</i></P>

<P><i>Signature</i></P>

<P></P>

<P><i>Dear Editor: The president was right on the other night when he 

              said he wanted to keep his word to seniors by locking away Social 

              Security and Medicare funds for Social Security and Medicare alone. 

              Here is a man that knows our generation created much of America&#146;s 

              greatness and he is delivering on his promise to keep Washington 

              from raiding seniors&#146; retirement and health care programs. 

              He has my support.</i></P>

<P><i>Signature</i></P>

<P></P>

<P><i>Dear Editor: The president&#146;s new budget looks a lot like my 

              personal budget. He funds what&#146;s important. He saves money 

              for unseen emergencies. He pays off as much debt as possible. He 

              takes care of seniors. And he gives reasonable tax relief. Looks 

              to me like he is making government decisions the way families make 

              family decisions.</i></P>

<P><i>Signature</i></P>

<P></P>

<P>Notice how all of these folksy dispatches attempt to steer attention 

              away from Bush&#146;s tax cut for the rich? Notice how they all 

              try to suggest that the Bush budget takes care of all of the nation&#146;s 

              needs? Notice the suggestion that Bush "is delivering on his promise 

              to keep Washington from raiding seniors&#146; retirement" &#151; 

              when, in fact, he wants to downsize Social Security so that more 

              retirement money can be risked on Wall Street?</P>

<P>This is classic "spin." The problem is that even the people on 

              the GOP e-mail list are giggling. As the person who forwarded these 

              sample letters to me put it: "It was really hard to control my laughter 

              when I read some of these."
