At approximately three o'clock this afternoon, a Dutch ship named Sea of Change will dock in Dublin, to be greeted by a storm of protesters, press and more than a few grateful women.

<P></P>

The brainchild of Rebecca Gomperts, a Dutch doctor and reproductive rights activist, the converted fishing boat has a state-of-the-art family planning clinic on board. The ship's volunteer medical team plans to travel around the world, docking in countries where family planning services and education are restricted. In port, in partnership with local women's groups, they'll provide safer sex information, counselling and pregnancy tests.

<P></P>

The Dutch ship Sea Change leaves the port of Scheveningen, The Netherlands Monday, June 11, 2001, for Dublin, Ireland, carrying on its deck a shipping container outfitted with medical facilities to perform abortions. The ship, leased by the group Women on Waves, says it is offering abortions to women outside the territorial limits of Ireland, where abortions are illegal. But the group said it did not plan to conduct surgical abortions during the Ireland trip, only administer medication to induce miscarriages. (AP Photo/ Fred Libochant) <br>

</font></font>Each morning, the ship will leave port, taking women with unwanted pregnancies 12 miles offshore into international waters, where their home countries have no jurisdiction, and provide them with abortions. (In international waters, ships operate under the law of the country where they are registered. Abortion is legal in The Netherlands.) At the same time, local service providers will be on hand to be trained in family planning and post-abortion care. Medical staff on Sea of Change will only abort first trimester pregnancies.

<P></P>

If the planned month-long stay in Ireland is successful, the crew intends to sail to other parts of the world where abortion is restricted and inaccessible: Poland, Malta, South America and much of Africa.

<P></P>

That all this is headline-grabbing is intentional. Gomperts conceived the idea when she was working as a physician on the Greenpeace ship, Rainbow Warrior. Greenpeace's direct action campaigns and clever media strategy inspired her to employ similar strategies in the struggle for reproductive rights.

<P></P>

The aim of Gomperts and her organization, Women on Waves (<i><a href="http://www.womenonwaves.org" target="new">http://www.womenonwaves.org</a></i>), is to increase the profile of the issue and put pressure on governments to change their laws. "We hope to provide a catalyst for legislation and simply want to give women a choice," she told The Guardian in Britain earlier this week. "We want to stress that we are offering a whole range of family planning information, not just abortions."

<P></P>

It's fitting that this initiative is driven by a Dutch group. Though it has a non-restrictive abortion law, The Netherlands has one of the lowest reported abortion rates in the world, largely due to the country's progressive and comprehensive family planning framework that provides universal sex education in schools and the provision of emergency contraception.

<P></P>

By contrast, the statistics provided by Women on Waves for the rest of the world (gathered from sources like the World Health Organization and the U.S.-based Alan Guttmacher Institute, a non-profit reproductive health research centre) are chilling:

<P></P>

<li></li>

Worldwide, more than one-third of all pregnancies are unplanned.

<P></P>

<li></li>

Every year nearly 25 per cent of all pregnant women worldwide - about 53 million - choose to have abortions; 20 million of these abortions are unsafe, resulting in the deaths of 70,000 women.

<P></P>

<li></li>

About 25 per cent of the world's population lives in countries with highly restrictive abortion laws, mostly in Latin America, Africa and Asia.

<P></P>

<li></li>

The legal status of abortion makes little difference to overall levels of abortion incidence - making it illegal does not reduce the number of abortions.

<P></P>

<li></li>

Where illegal, most abortions are done with unsafe methods causing complications in 40 per cent of the cases, as compared to less than 1 per cent where it is legal and accessible.

<P></P>

Women on Waves has already had to navigate some troubled waters. The group has applied to the Dutch government for a licence to perform abortions on the Sea of Change, but when it left port on Monday, the application had yet to be approved. If the licence isn't granted, the doctors on board could face prosecution upon their return.

<P></P>

And in Ireland, there will be further stormy seas. Bishop Michael Cox, head of the Latin Tridentine Church in Ireland, is setting sail on an ex-trawler dubbed The Little Bishop, straight into the path of the Sea of Change (Cox calls it the "murder ship") as it tours Ireland. Claiming to represent "almighty God and all right-minded, thinking Christians," the bishop told The Irish Times yesterday that "I will just be letting them know they're not welcome."

<P></P>

Many Irish women would beg to differ. Under the name Women on Waves Ireland, a group of Irish pro-choice activists has banded together in partnership with the Dutch group, in the hope of raising public awareness about the consequences of unwanted pregnancy and the lack of abortion services in Ireland. At least 6,000 Irish women travel each year to England to obtain abortion services. Women on Waves Ireland hopes the Sea of Change visit will catalyze efforts to liberalize abortion laws in Ireland.

<P></P>

And as Gomperts told <i>Mother Jones </i>magazine last year, "We have already identified some countries where the groups are really, really interested in working with us. And those are the countries we go to, not anywhere else."
