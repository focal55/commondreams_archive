 Sunday, Oct. 7, 2001:

<p>

This morning our country went to war. The flags are waving, the special announcements are being broadcast, the targets are named, the missiles are launched. It&#0039;s the moment we&#0039;ve been waiting for: our wounded nation striking back in righteous fury. 

<p>

I have been waiting all day for the rush, the adrenaline of uneasy excitement. I should be gnashing my teeth, riveted to my television, jacked up with fear and rage.<p>

Instead, I feel weary. I feel hollow and old and sad. Instead of adrenaline, I feel anesthesia setting in. Six thousand deaths were enough for me. I&#0039;ll have to go numb to bear more. <p>

I hate the Taliban, I hate Osama bin Laden. I hate Mohamed Atef, the Egyptian policeman they say planned the whole thing, and for the dead hijackers I feel a horror beyond hate. They say that the bombs we&#0039;re dropping will punish these people and those who support them. Maybe they will - while punishing thousands of others. <p>

If punishment were what I felt was most important, perhaps I could share in the grim patriotic fervor of this moment. But I care about keeping people safe, about making the world a better place to live, about protecting the values America claims to cherish.<p>

I feel a sorrowful certainty that this war will do the opposite - will decrease life, decrease liberty, decrease the perennially endangered and quixotic quantity we call happiness.<p>

On Sept. 11, I wept and I shook with fear. I sat before my television, my brain buzzing with a constant question: Is it over now? <p>

Today I am no longer on edge, for the answer is no. No, no, no, it&#0039;s just begun. Somewhere still, there are people running and debris flying and children crying. It was New York; now it&#0039;s another place full of innocent strangers. <p>

I don&#0039;t believe in revenge. I believe in trying to solve the problem. So don&#0039;t interrupt my football game. Whatever they say, I think we&#0039;ve already lost.
