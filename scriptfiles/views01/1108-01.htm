The Republican-controlled U.S. House of Representatives narrowly passed a

"trickle-down" economic stimulus package on a party-line vote that is now on

the Senate's agenda for consideration.  The contentious issues boil down to

a classical haves vs. have-nots conflict as the House-passed  bill gives fat

tax cut giveaways totaling $70 billion to big corporate and wealthy elites

rather than  helping out unemployed workers by increasing unemployment and

health benefits.



<p>The House-passed stimulus package gave the Enron Corporation a $254 million

dollar tax relief  gift.  Enron is a  Houston-based energy giant headed by

Kenneth Lay, who has been a close friend of George W. Bush and a principal

financier of Bush's political endeavors.  When Bush was Governor of Texas,

Lay recommended appointments to state boards and called on Bush to meet with

dignitaries from countries with whom Enron was hoping to do business. The

longstanding corporate/political relationship goes back to the first Bush

Administration when George W. used the family name to promote Enron's

ventures in Argentina. Enron was the major supplier of gas to California

and, in the fourth quarter of last year, their revenues had tripled from a

year earlier as energy prices soared in California's deregulated market.



<p>Enron was the largest contributor from the oil and gas industry in the

1999-2000 election cycle, giving $2.3 million in contributions.  In that

election cycle the oil and gas industry gave 78% of their contributions to

Republicans and Bush got $1.8 million, which was more than any federal

candidate received in the last 10 years. There was much speculation that Lay

would become Bush's Secretary of Energy and he has been a key advisor in

shaping the Bush/Cheney energy policy that has come under legal attack by

the Congressional Office of Management and Budget for being designed in

secrecy by big energy executives and the White House.  It calls for vastly

increased gas and oil production in the United States, but belittles

conservation and developing renewable energy sources.



<p>In a rapid reversal of fortunes, it appears that Enron, the big energy

insider, is running on empty.  There is mounting evidence of indictable

evil-doing by top officials of Enron, causing the  N.Y. Times to report on

November 7 that "various off-balance-sheet debts and related-party

transactions..have drawn the attention of the S.E.C.(Securities and Exchange

Commission).  On November 5, the Wall Street Journal reported that "the

company in March made a $35 million purchase from an entity run by a company

officer."  The Journal said the payment was part of a complex series of

transactions that allowed Enron to keep "hundreds of millions of dollars of

debt off its balance sheets the past three years, during which the

energy-trading giant has grown rapidly." And, "In recent weeks, Enron's

labyrinth of financial transactions, particularly with members of company

management, has come under intense scrutiny from investors and regulators."

Enron admitted the S.E.C. has begun a formal investigation. The Journal also

reported that Enron's auditor, Arthur Andersen, could face legal scrutiny on

the clarity of Enron disclosures.



<p>The Wall Street Journal also reported on the gloomy employment picture on

November 5 in a front page story with headlines reading, "Slow Economy Takes

Unusually Heavy Toll On White-Collar Jobs" and "As Service Sector Weakens,

Once-Hot Labor Market Is Quickly Turning Cold." On November 6, the Journal

again reported on the worsening job market with a story headlined with,

"Small Businesses Do What Big Firms Have Done-Cut Jobs." The N.Y. Times told

about job losses in the Cincinnati area under a headline "The Heartland

Hunkers Down" and U.S.A. Today had a story entitled, "Recession Conditions

Sink Several Sectors."



<p>On November 5, I received an e-mail from a women in Wisconsin who had just

read an essay I wrote about the unfairness of the House version of the

stimulus package.  She wrote, "Dear Tom:  I was just forwarded your

article-Terrorizing the Poor and Subsidizing the Rich. I found it to be so

true.  My husband lost his job on September 19 and still hasn't found

another.  He has sent out many, many resumes and has agencies also looking

for him. We live 20 miles north of Milwaukee, WI. and the job market is very

slim.  Our unemployment check is $266 a week.  The amount doesn't even cover

our mortgage payment.  We don't have any health insurance because there is

no way we can afford it. My husband has been looking for agencies that might

help us.  He is a Vietnam Vet. So much for giving to your country when they

need you. I can't tell you how stressful this has been. Every single day

it's a worry how we will pay our bills and will we end up losing our house

we have worked our entire lives for.  What can we do, who can we write to

and who will listen???"



<p>Write your U.S. Senators and demand they stand up to corruption  and

evil-doers like Enron.  The Senate should take away Enron's $254 million

gift and most of the $70 billion given to business interests in the

House-passed stimulus bill.  Jobless workers deserve the stimulus money to

pay their bills and survive with dignity.
