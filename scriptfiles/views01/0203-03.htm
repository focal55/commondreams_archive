As they struggle to keep the lights on in California, there are important

lessons that the rest of the nation can learn from this deregulatory

disaster To set the scene, five years ago California led the nation with a

bill that deregulated its electricity system. The promise was that the

wonders of competition would give consumers a vast array of choices at much

lower prices. To ensure the latter, the legislature actually wrote a rate

cut into the law.



<p>As things stand now, the state's two biggest utilities are standing on the

brink of bankruptcy. Residents in many parts of the state are living in

constant fear of blackouts, which have occurred sporadically over the last

three weeks. And, virtually everyone agrees that consumers will have to pay

more (i.e. not less) in coming years for their electricity.



<p>What went wrong? The short answer is that the electricity market is not

quite as competitive as the proponents of deregulation led people to

believe. It turns out that there is much more money to be made by supplying

a small amount of electricity at a high price, than a large amount of

electricity at a low price. Therefore, in the interest of generating profits

for its shareholders, the power companies in the area are not generating

enough electricity for California's economy.



<p>Of course the whole story is more complex than this, and the deregulators

will claim that the problem was not really deregulation, just that

California didn't deregulate in the right way. But this is like saying that

central planning is the way to run an economy, the Soviet Union just didn't

get it right. That one won't fly.



<p>The basic fact is that people of California got suckered into supporting a

policy that was driven by an ideology which says deregulation and markets

are always good, and the government is bad. There were plenty of economists

who could have easily explained why California's deregulation plan was

doomed to fail, but these people were ignored. Instead, at the urging of the

power companies that stood profit, and the prophets of the free market, the

state puts its power system at risk. Now it is paying the price.



<p>In addition to dealing with this disaster, the nation should also try to

learn from it. The most important lesson to learn is that an unregulated

market does not always do things best. This is often going to be the case in

an industry where there are a relatively small number of competitors, like

the electricity generation market, and possibly also the airline industry.

California's regulated electricity system surely was not perfect, but it did

its job, providing the population with a secure source of electricity at a

reasonable price for most of a century. It would have been more reasonable

to modernize the system of regulation, to take advantage of possibilities

offered by new technologies, rather than discard the system in its entirety.



<p>But electricity deregulation isn't the only place where policy is being

driven by free market ideology rather than common sense. The push to

privatize Social Security similarly defies logic. Every serious analysis

shows that replacing Social Security with individual accounts will lead to

administrative costs running into tens of billions of dollars annually. This

money is taken directly out of workers' retirement nest eggs. The experience

of nations like Britain also suggests that many account holders are likely

to fall victim to deceptive sales people and end up taking a bath on their

holdings. Individual accounts are a bad substitute for a system which, all

experts agree, can pay every penny of scheduled for nearly forty years, and

will always pay a larger real benefit than that received by current

retirees, with no changes ever.



<p>Similarly, the plan to replace Medicare with vouchers would have been long

dead if anyone looked at the evidence. More than one-third of the Medicare

beneficiaries who have signed up with H.M.O.'s have already been dropped.

The H.M.O.'s claim that they can't make a profit with the prices paid by

Medicare. Let's take them at their word. They are apparently less efficient

than the government in providing health care to the elderly.



<p>Anyone can make a mistake, but only a fool repeats the same mistake twice.

The free market ideologues got the people of California to put their economy

and even their safety at risk in a foolish deregulatory scheme. The nation

should learn from this failure. We can't afford to jeopardize the retirement

security of our workers and the health care system for the elderly. The

proven success of Social Security and Medicare is better than the

predictable failure of the privatization of these two programs.
