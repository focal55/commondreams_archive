<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->In our imminent war in the Middle East, it might be wise for our leaders to 

step back and study the pages of history. After Germany was destroyed in 

World War I, the world allowed that country to wallow in squalor, providing 

the perfect environment for Nazism to fester and grow into a monster. When 

we finally beat this new monster in World War II, our leaders understood 

that in order to permanently prevent another inter-continental conflict we 

would have to address the desperate economic situations that created the war 

environment in the first place. America responded with the Marshall Plan 

that sent billions in economic aid abroad, and the result has been one of 

the strongest alliances between two continents in modern history.



<p>Now, instead of fighting fascism, we are fighting terrorism, but the lesson 

the Marshall Plan taught us about how to create a lasting solution should be 

the same. In our new war, we must not only pursue the terrorists who 

perpetrated the September 11th attack, but also aggressively attack 

international poverty that provides the breeding ground for terrorism in the 

first place.



<p>Historically, humans tend to confront only the immediate threat - the 

intruder, the enemy - and not underlying motivations. In science, this is 

called a fundamental attribution error. It is as if a doctor tried to cure a 

painful cancer by giving the patient a painkiller instead of removing the 

tumor. War, violence and religious fundamentalism are merely the symptom. 

The true disease is poverty, oppression and hopelessness that allow these 

evils to fester. The more desperate a population, the more susceptible it is 

to embracing extremism and becoming a trouble spot. Terrorist demagogues 

like Osama bin Laden may mask their goals in religious themes - but the 

reason their rhetoric finds such a captive audience is because they are 

preaching an us-versus-them message to a population looking for something – 

anything – to cling to. The September 11th disaster was merely the latest 

success in their populist campaign.



<p>But now we live in an age where suicidal barbarians can kill thousands at a 

time, right on our own soil. The threat is now so great, that need something 

other than our normal strategy of  “containment.” We must finally address 

the real problem of international poverty that has helped transform 

anti-Americanism sentiment into the monstrous deeds of September 11th.  That 

means reversing our recent decrease in foreign aid and investing capital 

abroad not only to strengthen our own economy and corporate assets, but to 

strengthen the host country's economy and standard of living as well 

(Israel, Taiwan, and South Korea are just a few successes). That means 

countering the image of American opulence spread by the media with a serious 

commitment to making sure that there is as little squalor throughout the 

globe as possible. In short, that means embarking on a groundbreaking 

campaign to finally engage impoverished areas of the world that we have 

until now largely ignored.



<p>To be sure, we must bring the perpetrators of the September 11th massacre to 

justice. Their crimes are unspeakable and they pose a serious security 

threat to our nation. Additionally, though, we must seize this moment to 

begin addressing how to end terrorism now - and forever. Whereas before, 

internationalism may have been altruism, it is now clearly in our own 

self-interest to prevent more countries from falling into the same type of 

squalor that has galvanized extremism in parts of the Middle East. In the 

heightened stakes of a nuclear age, we need not only a jihad against 

terrorism, but a jihad against the roots of jihad itself.
