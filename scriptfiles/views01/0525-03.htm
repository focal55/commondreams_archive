Like little kids who squirm through dinner until they can finally grab for

dessert, Corporate America in the last few months has had a hard time

controlling its hunger for corporate tax cuts and new tax subsidies.



<p>With President George W. Bush making his giant tax gift to rich

individuals his first major legislative priority, the administration asked

Big Business to hold off on its request for corporate tax breaks.



<p>For weeks on end, the corporate tax lobbyists worked hard to control

themselves, sitting quietly while Congress debated whether the targeted

tax cut for the wealthy should total $1.3 trillion or $1.6 trillion over

the next decade (actually much higher with honest accounting).



<p>But as time wore on, the waiting simply became too much, especially as it

became more and more clear that the Bush administration was going to be

able to ram through its tax gift to the rich. When talk started to emerge

of a Democratic push for a minimum wage hike, it was more than the

corporate tax lobby could stand. The business lobbyists immediately began

scheming over which corporate tax cut they could attach to a minimum wage

increase.



<p>And that's just the beginning.  In a blockbuster interview with the

Financial Times earlier this week, Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill said he

"absolutely" backs the abolition of taxes on corporations. That's

abolition as in all federal income taxes.



<p>"The clear economic truth is that businesses and corporations don't pay

taxes, they just collect them for the government," O'Neill told the

Financial Times. "Because businesses and corporations have to recover all

of their costs and earn the cost of capital, after all of their expenses

including taxes."



<p>O'Neill's argument is that it is irrational to force corporations to pay

taxes, rather than individuals, since corporations just pass on the cost

of taxes to consumers. This argument ignores the evidence showing that

corporations cannot simply pass all costs on to consumers. The underlying

notion that corporations just represent the sum of interests of

shareholders ignores the fact that corporations retain huge earnings, and

the institutional reality that corporations have a life, identity and

existence of their own, beyond that linked to shareholders. Above all, the

argument that corporate taxes should be eliminated, with taxes collected

instead from individuals only, is -- from an administration that is right

now pushing through a massive tax cut for individuals -- a spectacularly

brazen effort to shrink government revenues and the potential scope of

government activity.



<p>There is little chance of business registering an accomplishment as

breathtaking as O'Neill's proposal, at least in the short-run, but the

corporate lobby may well seek a reduction in its tax rate to match the

rate slashes for rich individuals in the Bush plan. And Big Business will

be able to use O'Neill's sentiment to argue that the corporate tax rate

should be progressively driven down, towards zero.



<p>If the big corporations get their way, and manage to attain significant

tax cuts of one kind or another -- and there is plenty of reason to expect

they will -- it will continue a 30-year trend.



<p>Three decades ago, corporations paid about a quarter of all U.S. federal

taxes. Now the corporate share is down to approximately 10 percent.



<p>The nominal tax rate on corporations is 35 percent, but the effective tax

rate on big corporations is approximately 21 percent, according to the

Washington, D.C.-based Citizens for Tax Justice (CTJ).



<p>A 2000 CTJ study of the 1998 income tax payments of 250 of the largest

corporations determined that two dozen had negative federal income tax

payments --meaning the received rebate checks from the U.S. Treasury.



<p>Led by General Electric, which finagled just under $7 billion in tax

breaks in 1998, at least 25 corporations, including Ford, First Union,

AT&T, Bell Atlantic, Merck, Microsoft, Bristol Myers-Squibb and Exxon --

exploited tax loopholes to gain at least $1 billion in tax breaks,

according to CTJ. (Someone should ask Paul O'Neill: Did these corporations

offer lower prices to consumers?)



<p>Key corporate tax escapes include complicated financial transactions and

transfer pricing which enable corporations to claim earnings outside of

the United States, and in lower-tax jurisdictions; accelerated

depreciation schedules for corporate investments; tax rules that enable

companies to claim stock options as an expense, even though the options

are issued at no cost to the company; and targeted tax provisions that

confer benefits on specific industries.



<p>Politically, it should be harder to push through significant corporate tax

cuts than the tax reductions for individuals. There is little doubt that

public confusion about who will benefit from the Bush plan, and how much,

has been key to enabling its passage. O'Neill's dissembling

notwithstanding, average people are less likely to be under the illusion

that corporate tax cuts will put money in their pocketbooks.



<p>On the other hand, from the corporate point of view, almost anything and

everything seems possible in today's Washington.
