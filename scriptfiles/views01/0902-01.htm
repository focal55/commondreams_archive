It was only a tiny item, easy to miss amid the daily flood of Orwellian 
Newspeak from the Bush administration. A Sunday New York Times reader wanted 
to know what George W. intends to do with his tax rebate check. The answer 
came from Times White House correspondent, Frank Bruni, who has been covering 
Bush's endless summer down in Crawford, Texas.
<P>Asked by reporters if he'd received his own rebate check yet, Bush "paused 
for a few seconds and looked at his aides before saying, 'Not to my knowledge.
' "
<P>Asked how he planned to spend the money when the check did arrive, Bush 
said, "Charity."
<P>Which charity?
<P>"I don't know yet."
<P>Then, the coup de grace.
<P>Bush was asked why he would donate his tax rebate to charity instead of 
doing what he's encouraged all of us to do with our shares of the $38 billion 
temporary give-back -- buy things to goose the slumping economy.
<P>"It's something people ought to do," he said.
<P>How to explain the contradiction?
<P>It could be the rumored stupidity of Bush the Lesser, proof that there is 
truth behind all the jokes and Doonesbury cartoons about an empty puppet in 
the Oval Office and a Dr. Strangelove-like cabal manipulating his strings.
<P>Haw-haw. The man can't even remember from one day to the next the 
cornerstones of his own economic policy. Haw-haw.
<P>Or it could be something else, something even scarier than stupidity. The 
arrogant disconnect that comes with privilege.
<P>Despite all the down-home rhetoric that George W. chomps on and spits out 
like cheekfuls of Redman, he and the most veteran of his puppeteers are a 
pretty cynical group of wealthy and powerful individuals. They know there are 
really two sets of rules: one for all of us dopes who can't imagine asking an 
aide whether our tax rebate check has arrived, and one for them, the noblesse 
oblige.
<P>Their rules are long on things like capital gains taxes, and short on 
things like waking up at 3 a.m. from fear of losing your Medicare benefits. 
Their rules don't encompass monthly in-home lotteries where you have to choose 
between paying the energy bill or your insurance premium. The only worry they 
have about the cost of prescription drugs is whether their stock portfolios 
include shares in the top-earning pharmaceutical companies.
<P>The rules for us dopes involve a lot of mixed signals, like being told, 
"It's your money, not the Washington bureaucrats'," yet being nudged toward 
Wal-Mart or Home Depot to separate ourselves as fast as possible from our $300 
nuggets of "tax relief."
<P>After all, consumer spending (we are reminded hourly) accounts for two-
thirds of the U.S. economy. It is our responsibility, especially in a downturn, to keep buying more stuff. Whether we need it or not. Whether we can afford 
it or not.
<P>The rules for us dopes say we should pay no attention to the $20 trillion 
many of us -- especially those who earn below the median income -- have 
wracked up in consumer debt. Nor should we bother about the 24.99 annual 
percentage rate that banks have begun to slap onto our Visas or MasterCards 
because we were late with a payment, not to them, but to some other lender.
<P>The dope rules say we should focus instead on our consumer duty by snagging 
one of those multiple offers that come our way for brand new platinum or 
titanium charge cards with $15,000 lines of credit and free miles.
<P>The dope rules say we should ignore the fact that this summer's round of 
"tax relief" is really an advance against next year's tax bill. Come April '02, look out for the boomerang effect. Minus a big economic rebound, it will have 
to be paid back. So, too, we should not question the wisdom of an obscenely 
expensive anti-missile shield for outer space even though, to continue current 
levels of funding for the poor, the uneducated, the ill and the environment, 
Congress will have to dip into $9 billion of our Social Security trust fund.
<P>As for all the firings, layoffs and jobs cut through attrition -- thousands 
every week now -- well, the last thing we dopes should do is let that shake 
our all-important consumer confidence.
<P>George Orwell's "1984" begins with protagonist Winston Smith questioning 
the contradictions in the ruling party's philosophy: War is Peace. Freedom is 
Slavery. Ignorance is Strength. The novel ends with a broken and brainwashed 
Winston believing that "2 plus 2 equals 5."
<P>George W. Bush will not buy stuff with his tax rebate. He will give it to a 
charity to be named later. Do as he says, not as he does. Ignorance is 
Strength.
