On March 23, 1983, Ronald Reagan surprised the nation and the

world by announcing an ambitious research program designed to render

nuclear weapons "impotent and obsolete."  Reagan acknowledged that this

"formidable technical task...may not be accomplished before the end of

this century."

<p>The end of the 20th century has come and gone, but Reagan's

dream of a shield against nuclear weapons lives on.  In the eighteen

years since, the Pentagon has spent more than $70 billion on missile

defense programs without producing a workable system.

<p>The original mission has been whittled down from the ambitious

goal of defending the U.S. against the threat posed by thousands of

Soviet warheads to the more modest objective of protecting the U.S. from

a handful of warheads from North Korea or Iraq.  But under George W.

Bush, Reagan's dream may get a second chance.  Bush has promised to

deploy a system capable of defending the entire United States from

ballistic missile attack, as well as "our friends and allies and

deployed forces overseas."

<p>How is President Bush going to accomplish this?  No one is

saying, at least not yet.  President Bush has talked about developing a

layered missile defense system with interceptors on land, at sea, on

airplanes, and in outer space, but a detailed explanation of the

administration's plans won't be available until Defense Secretary Donald

Rumsfeld completes his military posture review later this year. 

However, the same kinds of technical problems, cost overruns, and

diplomatic obstacles that brought Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative

to a halt in the 1980s are likely to derail Bush's equally expansive

missile defense vision.

<p>A report released last month by the Pentagon's Office of

Independent Testing and Evaluations outlined the daunting challenges

facing U.S. missile defense programs.  In addition to the land-based

National Missile Defense (NMD) system that Bush inherited from the

Clinton administration, other programs likely to garner more attention

in his administration are the Navy Theater Wide (NTW) system and the

Space Based Laser (SBL) program.

<p>For the National Missile Defense system, which failed two out of its'

three intercept tests, the report warns that the system is far from

ready to intercept the kinds of missiles "currently deployed by the

established nuclear powers" - missiles that employ countermeasures and

decoys. The report warns that the Navy Theater Wide system, a sea-based

system being touted by many proponents as a near-term, "quick and easy"

alternative to the NMD system, is not currently a viable option. And the

highly touted Space Based Laser is little more than a concept at this

stage.

<p>The costs of deploying a missile defense system now will range anywhere

from the General Accounting Office's $60 billion estimate for the

limited NMD system currently being tested, to $240 billion or more for

the multi-layered approach that President Bush seems to support.

<p>Unfortunately, by seeking only military/technical solutions to

the missile threat, President Bush is underestimating the consequences

for international security of deploying an ambitious NMD system. As the

U.S. government's top intelligence analyst on missile proliferation

suggested last summer, deployment of an NMD system would set off "an

unsettling series of political and military ripple effects . . . that

would include a sharp buildup of strategic and medium-range nuclear

missiles by China, India, and Pakistan and the further spread of

military technology in the Middle East." In essence, an NMD deployment

could create the very threats it is supposed to counter.

<p>But there are other ways of dealing with the threat; ways that

even Ronald Reagan eventually acknowledged were more effective in

protecting us from nuclear weapons. After all, it was Reagan who agreed

to eliminate intermediate range nuclear weapons from Europe.  He also

set the stage for the first major reductions in nuclear weapons under

the START I Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty.

<p>Instead of pinning all of his hopes on a costly and unproven

missile defense program, President Bush should go on the diplomatic

offensive to reduce nuclear dangers now.  He should start by taking up

Russian President Vladimir Putin's offer to reduce U.S. and Russian

strategic nuclear warheads to 1,000 or less per side.   He should also

take the advice of Secretary of State Colin Powell and Korean President

Kim Dae Jung by picking up where the Clinton administration left off in

the U.S.-North Korean talks on ending Pyonyang's nuclear weapons and

ballistic missile programs. 

<p>Star Wars wasn't the right response during the Cold War, it

seems clear that missile defense is not the appropriate response today

either. The sooner President Bush realizes this, the sooner he can

proceed with a more practical plan for defending us from post-Cold War

nuclear threats.
