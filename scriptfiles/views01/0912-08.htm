September 11 was a day of sadness, anger and fear.

<p>Like everyone in the United States and around the world, I shared the deep 
sadness at the deaths of thousands.

<p>But as I listened to people around me talk, I realized the anger and fear I 
felt were very different, for my primary anger is directed at the leaders 
of this country and my fear is not only for the safety of Americans but for 
innocents civilians in other countries.

<p>It should need not be said, but I will say it: The acts of terrorism that 
killed civilians in New York and Washington were reprehensible and 
indefensible; to try to defend them would be to abandon one's humanity. No 
matter what the motivation of the attackers, the method is beyond discussion.

<p>But this act was no more despicable as the massive acts of terrorism -- the 
deliberate killing of civilians for political purposes -- that the U.S. 
government has committed during my lifetime. For more than five decades 
throughout the Third World, the United States has deliberately targeted 
civilians or engaged in violence so indiscriminate that there is no other 
way to understand it except as terrorism. And it has supported similar acts 
of terrorism by client states.

<p>If that statement seems outrageous, ask the people of Vietnam. Or Cambodia 
and Laos. Or Indonesia and East Timor. Or Chile. Or Central America. Or 
Iraq, or Palestine. The list of countries and peoples who have felt the 
violence of this country is long. Vietnamese civilians bombed by the United 
States. Timorese civilians killed by a U.S. ally with U.S.-supplied 
weapons. Nicaraguan civilians killed by a U.S. proxy army of terrorists. 
Iraqi civilians killed by the deliberate bombing of an entire country's 
infrastructure.

<p>So, my anger on this day is directed not only at individuals who engineered 
the Sept. 11 tragedy but at those who have held power in the United States 
and have engineered attacks on civilians every bit as tragic. That anger is 
compounded by hypocritical U.S. officials' talk of their commitment to 
higher ideals, as President Bush proclaimed "our resolve for justice and 
peace."

<p>To the president, I can only say: The stilled voices of the millions killed 
in Southeast Asia, in Central America, in the Middle East as a direct 
result of U.S. policy are the evidence of our resolve for justice and peace.

<p>Though that anger stayed with me off and on all day, it quickly gave way to 
fear, but not the fear of "where will the terrorists strike next," which I 
heard voiced all around me. Instead, I almost immediately had to face the 
question: "When will the United States, without regard for civilian 
casualties, retaliate?" I wish the question were, "Will the United States 
retaliate?" But if history is a guide, it is a question only of when and where.

<p>So, the question is which civilians will be unlucky enough to be in the way 
of the U.S. bombs and missiles that might be unleashed. The last time the 
U.S. responded to terrorism, the attack on its embassies in Kenya and 
Tanzania in 1998, it was innocents in the Sudan and Afghanistan who were in 
the way. We were told that time around they hit only military targets, 
though the target in the Sudan turned out to be a pharmaceutical factory.

<p>As I monitored television during the day, the talk of retaliation was in 
the air; in the voices of some of the national-security "experts" there was 
a hunger for retaliation. Even the journalists couldn't resist; speculating 
on a military strike that might come, Peter Jennings of ABC News said that 
"the response is going to have to be massive" if it is to be effective.

<p>Let us not forget that a "massive response" will kill people, and if the 
pattern of past U.S. actions holds, it will kill innocents. Innocent 
people, just like the ones in the towers in New York and the ones on the 
airplanes that were hijacked. To borrow from President Bush, "mother and 
fathers, friends and neighbors" will surely die in a massive response.

<p>If we are truly going to claim to be decent people, our tears must flow not 
only for those of our own country. People are people, and grief that is 
limited to those within a specific political boundary denies the humanity 
of others.

<p>And if we are to be decent people, we all must demand of our government -- 
the government that a great man of peace, Martin Luther King Jr., once 
described as "the greatest purveyor of violence in the world" -- that the 
insanity stop here.
