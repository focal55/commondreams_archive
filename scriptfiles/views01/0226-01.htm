Embarrassed Pentagon officials admitted last week that most of the bombs

recently dropped on Iraq by U.S. and British warplanes missed their mark. When

will they admit that the bombing itself violates international law and could

well be characterized as state terrorism?

<P>

   That's unlikely to happen, although there are no United Nations resolutions

that justify attacking Iraq for violating the so-called "no-fly zones."

<P>



The U.S. and Britain superimposed these illusory zones following the 1991

Persian Gulf War ostensibly to protect Kurd and Shiite dissidents from the

wrath of dictator Saddam Hussein. But soon it became a pretext for prosecuting

a quiet war against Iraq, allowing the U.S. military, with considerable

British support, to launch air strikes whenever it felt sufficiently provoked.

<P>

   The United States was conducting "a low-grade war, fashioned by the

military and the (Clinton) administration without public debate, aimed at

salvaging the administration's `containment' policy toward Saddam Hussein and

destabilizing his regime," wrote the Washington Post on March 7, 1999.

<P>

   Apparently, the Bush administration is picking up the Clinton

administration's policy of state terrorism. Although we think of terrorism as

an exclusive tactic of the weak, the "smart bombs" dropped without the

justification of self-defense or international legality are just as

representative of terrorism as suicide bombs exploded on buses.

<P>

   We've dropped tons of illegal "smart bombs" on Iraq's people. Despite that,

Hussein remains ensconced as Iraq's leader and is gaining new esteem in other

parts of the Arab world. His financial support for the survivors of those

killed or injured during the Palestinians' recent protests against Israeli

occupation has made him a hero to many Palestinians. If U.S policy was

designed to oust Hussein and isolate his regime, it has failed miserably.

<P>

   By continuing this flawed policy, President Bush is dashing the hopes of

many (including the majority of Arab-Americans who voted for him) who assumed

he would alter the nation's ineffective Mideast policy. Those assumptions were

well founded; during the campaign, Bush left Arab-American groups with little

doubt that his election would prompt a policy shift.

<P>

   What's more, this hoped-for policy change is something one would expect

from the son of the first President Bush. In 1991, the father organized

wide-ranging opposition to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, and one of the elder

Bush's bargaining chips was the implicit understanding he would bring balance

to U.S. Middle East policy. That is, he would ease America's bias toward

Israel. Since many of the officials in the first Bush administration now serve

his son (including Secretary of State Colin Powell, who was chairman of the

Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Vice President Dick Cheney, then the secretary of

defense), it was reasonable to expect some policy continuity.

<P>

   Powell has suggested as much in statements regarding his visit this week to

the Middle East. He has suggested the administration would take a more

regional approach to problems in the troubled area. That's State Department

lingo for showing more concern for the sensitivities of the Arab states while

becoming less pro-Israel, or at least less blatantly so.

<P>

   But the administration's illegal bombings and use of Saddam demonology for

justification hearkens back to the tired tactics of the past. There is no UN

support for the policy because Iraq has violated no resolutions. Instead, the

attacks have burnished Hussein's luster as an Arab hero who has defied the

dictates of the world's most powerful nation and survived.

<P>

   Meanwhile, these Arab nations watch the U.S. offer uncritical support to

Israel, which regularly violates UN resolutions by expanding settlements on

occupied land. The recent election of Ariel Sharon, devoted champion of

expanded settlements, as Israel's prime minister has added another level of

frustration to supporters of the Palestinians. Sharon is known for his

hard-line military tactics and is deeply hated by many Arabs. He was the

architect of Israel's invasion of Lebanon and was deemed partially culpable

(even by an Israeli commission) for the 1982 massacre of Palestinian refugees

at the Sabra and Shatila camps near Beirut.

<P>

   Distressingly, Sharon ascended to leadership on the back of a Palestinian

rebellion that he himself triggered with a visit to an Islamic holy site on

Sept. 26.

<P>

   America's cavalier reaction to Sharon's rise to power illustrates our

double standards on Mideast policy like little else. The illegal bombings of

Baghdad put an exclamation point on it.
