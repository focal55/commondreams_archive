The noise in D.C. after a Massachusetts company announced it had cloned a human embryo turns out to have been much ado about not a lot — unless, you happen to be George W. Bush. The Bush team is scrambling to pull together its allies to put out some political brushfires, but reawakening the cloning controversy is unlikely to do the trick.   

<p>

Advanced Cell Technology, a small biotech firm, doesn't seem to have advanced much of anything, except perhaps its own public profile, and a quest for investors and/or a patent. With respect to the science, according to the firm's own announcement it produced too few human cells —  only six from some 41 eggs —  to produce any all-important stem cells. 

<p>

Stem cells, because of their ability to replicate all the body's tissues, hold promise for treating an array of injuries and diseases. The cells the Massachusetts firm produced all died almost at once. But the announcement about them lived long enough to reheat a debate about medical ethics and reproduction. 

<p>

The vast majority of stem cells used in research come from discarded (or excess) embryos — stored at in-vitro fertilization clinics after a client has successfully birthed a child. Scientists can also extract stem cells from aborted fetuses from consenting patients who have terminated their pregnancies. 

<p>

Advanced Cell Technologies said their petri-dish efforts were solely intended to produce cells for research, not to reproduce human beings. Nonetheless, George W. Bush gathered religious and political leaders around him on the White House lawn to condemn the work. "The use of embryos to clone is wrong," said G.W. "We should not as a society grow life to destroy it." 

<p>

Bush backs an amendment calling for a 6-month cloning moratorium. The proposed temporary ban follows Bush's decision last August to strictly limit embryonic stem cell research and forbid federal funding of the work. And in a nasty week for the President, Bush was happy to distract folks from war and terrorism. The Bush team's anti-terror tactics are provoking criticism even among conservatives, finally. 

<p>

Last week, several high-ranking FBI officials, including one former director of the agency, condemned Ashcroft's program of mandatory interrogation, mass detention, wire-tapping and military tribunals (Washington Post, 11/28). Overseas, Bush's allies are raising questions — and European voters are seeing pictures — barred from the U.S. media. There are questions swirling just about everywhere but here about possible U.S. war crimes in Afghanistan. Pentagon officials Monday were forced to admit that U.S. bombers killed scores of civilians in eastern Afghanistan as well as friendly "anti-Taliban" fighters over the weekend. The civilian death toll mounts.

<p>

Bush was trying to waken the old pro-life giant, by gathering critics of cloning together to talk about medicine and ethics. But in the United States, the medical research issue actually cuts across "choice" lines. The Senate has rejected a broad cloning ban in the past, and if it comes to a Senate vote this week as expected, opponents of cloning are likely to be matched in their vigor by research supporters, who have the backing of most Democrats and some key Republicans — Sen. Arlen Specter to name just one. 

<p>

(When Bush says "we should not as a society grow life to destroy it," it has some unintended resonance: The U.S. is in the middle of a war against former clients: religious extremists. How about that form of life? Perhaps we shouldn't, as a society grow them, either.) 

<p>

The Senate is due to vote Monday on an amendment calling for a cloning moratorium, attached to a nasty piece of energy legislation that would allow oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska.
