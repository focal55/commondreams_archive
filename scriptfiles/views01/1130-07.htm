George and the Pope agree about the sanctity of human life. Both claim

to be loyal to the teachings of Jesus. Sure, they’ve had their

disagreements in the past. The Pope asked George to spare the life of

Karla Faye Tucker, a convicted murderer who was, like George, born

again. But her rebirth didn’t have the same pedigree as George’s and the

then governor had to refuse the Pope. But he did say this was not Texas

justice it was God’s. Hopefully that eased the Pope’s concerns about

capital punishment in general. As George so often says in reference to

people who don’t agree with him, “I’ll explain to him….” I’ll explain to

them….” The implication of course is that they don’t get it and with the

right amount of patience he will be able to delineate all the

complexities that will shed light on what they are not grasping.



<p>Will George explain Mazar-i-sharif? Will the Pope and George and Billy

Graham Jr. stand in the middle of the blood-soaked fortress and proclaim

the sanctity of human life? As the reports from foreign press come in,

which contradicts earlier reports that the sight of a British journalist

set off the “riot”, we are now learning that a CIA agent from Alabama

was interrogating a group of Taliban prisoners. He apparently asked one

prisoner, “What are you doing in Afghanistan?” A question that a more

collected and less vulnerable person might have responded to by putting

the question back to the interrogator. Instead the question itself, or

the question in the context of other questions, or the face of the agent

– or the tone – or just the entire angst of the moment lit the fuse.

Clearly the situation was like a bomb that could have been defused or

ignited. It seems as though the CIA agent, however unwittingly, ignited

the bomb. What was he looking for? Information? A defector? Was he

hoping that one of these desperate and defeated men would divulge the

whereabouts of the mastermind of all our troubles – Osama? From the

pictures it looked as of it was a shooting gallery. Human beings

pulverized with overwhelming firepower. This is a war for civilization

after all and when you’re fighting for civilization itself no firepower

can be spared.



<p>Stories and convoluted explanations will cover any hint of atrocity.



<p>But getting back to the sanctity of human life – the prisoners of war in

Mazer-i-sharif are now camera fodder for journalists. Was there sanctity

to their lives?  Did they have families? Will they be mourned anywhere?

Or are they, as the apologists might claim, happy martyrs who got the

death they wanted? But good Christians who believe in the sanctity of

human life shouldn’t care how they wanted to die. Good Christians, as

the two new celebrities who emerged from a Taliban prison looking as if

they had been at a spa, will say, you must preserve human life. Human

life is sacred.



<p>Even if the Pope and the president can’t quite get the absolute truth of

that great Christian principle once they move outside

a doctor’s office or a research laboratory, one hoped that these

missionaries might have seized the opportunity to quote their personal

savior as microphones and cameras were being leveled at them. Talk about

missionary work. They were right there – they could have quoted Jesus

safely at the White House or at CNN. No – they were just so grateful for

all the prayers - for them. They forgot what propelled them to

Afghanistan.



<p>They brought pictures of Jesus and literature about him, but they

skipped the tough, gut truth of Jesus, which could have been

taught without mentioning his name in Afghanistan. They could have

reminded born again George as he orchestrated his holy campaign against

all things evil and they could have even used the name of their mutual

savior. They, if the Pope and Billy Graham Jr. aren’t up to it, could

have done the work of Jesus right there in the safe haven of a white

Christian house. Christ said – “If you live by the sword you die by the

sword.” He said, “Love your enemy.” He said, “Love even those who hate

you.” He said, “Blessed are the peacemakers.”  They could have asked the

question, “What would Jesus do?” But they didn’t.



<p>The man threatening the sanctity of human life, according to our two

powerful Christian leaders, is that man doing that cloning in

Massachusetts. Rumsfeld, Wolfowitz, and cuddly Tommy Franks do not

threaten the sanctity of human life. It’s good vs. evil. We will only

kill evil human life and if neutral human life is lost in the process

that will just have to be worth it. Of course Christ did teach

redemption and forgiveness but he lived in a time that didn’t have

weapons of mass destruction so those notions, sweet as they are, need to

be streamlined and overhauled. And George and the Pope and Billy Graham

Jr. are doing that and it’s a good thing for civilization. They and

bible-reading John Ashcroft will keep all American lives safe as they

bomb Afghanistan and shred civil liberties and impose secrecy. These are

all good Christian principles because above all they want to keep us

safe. 



<p>Our lives are sacred and valuable and if we keep praying and shopping,

all will be well. The terrorists are getting killed at a

respectable rate and that just makes the world and America safer and we

have to thank God for that. And we will all pray that the rest of the

world and the mad scientists in this country will respect human life

because there is no greater value on the planet – except maybe safety.

And the more evildoers we kill the safer we’ll be. And our smart bombs

and our special op forces know the face of evil and they will kill

appropriately because that is what Christ would want them to do. Kill

only the appropriate people. Yes – that’s it. That’s the new message of

Christ. Kill the people that need killing. And soon we will all live in

peace. And all life will have sanctity.
