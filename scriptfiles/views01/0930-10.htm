After two weeks of personal and political attacks from fellow citizens 

because of our antiwar writing, we have relearned how dissent is honored in 

the United States.



<p>Many Americans like dissent that is safely in the past, where it does not 

raise uncomfortable questions or challenge contemporary prejudices. But 

dissent in the present, about matters of the greatest public importance, 

well, that's quite another matter.



<p>One of us, a graduate student of Indian origin, has been told to "go back 

to Afghanistan where you came from," even though he was born in the United 

States. "After what this country's done for you, how dare you attack us, 

you (#$@%)?" wrote another.



<p>Meanwhile, a Texas newspaper on Sept. 14 published an essay by the other, 

an Anglo professor, that asked Americans to turn from the desire to react 

with massive violence and confront some of the ugly truths about our own 

history of targeting civilians in war, so we can understand how we are 

viewed in much of the rest of the world.



<p>That piece generated lots of angry messages from citizens and alumni, to 

the author and University of Texas officials, making it clear they would 

send neither money nor their children to UT until said professor was fired. 

The president's response was to issue a statement acknowledging the 

professor's right to speak but suggesting that no one need pay attention to 

such a "fountain of undiluted foolishness on issues of public policy."



<p>We're not complaining about any of this; we're glad we were attacked. It is 

not flippant to say that it is better to be hated than ignored; people are 

paying attention, finally.



<p>Too often Americans have "honored" dissent by ignoring it, allowing people 

to speak because they thought it would make no difference.



<p>For several years we have been part of organizing aimed at changing U.S. 

actions around the world, including the movement to end the sanctions on 

Iraq and resist the U.S./NATO attack on Yugoslavia. The response of most 

Americans on such issues has been a collective yawn.



<p>The 3,000 email and phone messages we have received since Sept. 11 suggest 

that times have changed. The ferociousness of the response means we've hit 

a nerve.



<p>The people who in the past refused to listen to us but "defended" our right 

to speak had a very incomplete notion of the rights and obligations of a 

citizen in a democracy. For too long, too many people have accepted the 

notion that democracy means simply the right to be left alone to engage in 

our private pursuits, with a trip to the voting booth every couple of 

years. In truth, the heart of democracy is the ability of the people to 

affect government policy, including foreign policy.



<p>The first step in the process of re-politicization has been 

achieved  people are listening and reacting.



<p>Now that America has been attacked, people finally see the relevance of 

foreign policy to their own interests.



<p>The next step is to have more and more people move past simply reacting to 

critical engagement with antiwar arguments. There is real potential to take 

this issue far beyond the traditional peace community.



<p>We must repeatedly ask people whether they understand that Bush's Sept. 20 

speech (when taken in conjunction with the joint resolution of Congress 

passed Sept. 14) announced an unlimited war against a potentially endless 

enemy. Do they understand the consequences of a war that the secretary of 

defense has said has no "exit strategies" and will be "a sustained 

engagement that carries no deadlines"? What do they imagine will be the end 

result of "draining the swamp," a reference by that same secretary to an 

old counterinsurgency term that means destroying societies suspected of 

harboring terrorists by creating refugees or killing civilians?



<p>A growing number of Americans are nervous, wondering how this bellicose 

talk of war is going to make them more secure. It is not a big jump from 

that nervousness to the conclusion that a military strike is not going to 

bring terrorists to real justice and may well start a war in which 

civilians on all sides will be victims. A recent poll indicates that 63 

percent of Americans believe that strikes on Afghanistan will increase the 

threat of terrorist attacks; that's a good place to start.



<p>The president has encouraged us to "return to normal"  i.e., politically 

detached and passive. The television anchors encourage us to stick to the 

narrow spectrum of opinion they allow on the air. We must say no, not only 

to the policy being sold us but to that conception of politics and public 

dialogue.



<p>A new, richer, public dialogue, is crucial. We need to re-create a genuine 

public sphere of political disputation and conversation, and recover a 

broader sense of society as well as of democracy. This war may finally be 

making it possible.
