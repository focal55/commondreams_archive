SEVERAL YEARS ago, when I was mugged and knifed in front of my home, a 

veteran newsman (and ex-Marine) took me to lunch and listened as I complained 

about how slowly I was managing to put the attack behind me. Then he gave me 

some advice that I count among the top 10 pieces of wisdom I've ever received.

<P>"Some things are just too big to get over," he said. "The best you can hope 

for is to learn to live with them."

<P>Until then, I don't think I'd ever realized there was a difference between 

getting over something and learning to live with it. Why would I?

<P>Like millions of Americans who came along after this country's hardest 

modern times -- two world wars and the Great Depression -- I was accustomed to 

a culture that is always in a hurry to heal, a people who specialize in taking 

shortcuts through suffering.

<P>With the highest material standard of living on Earth, many of us have come 

to believe that prolonged pain and sadness are for primitive societies and 

chumps. Here, take a pill or, better yet, buy something; that will cheer you 

up. Even grief, the ageless, universal, human response to loss, has an 

unwritten due-date attached. It's been a year (or two) now; don't you think 

it's time you got on with your life?

<P>Besides separating us from most of the world, this tendency to shortcut 

pain or discomfort makes us soft in the unattractive, whiny way the over-

indulged and over-fed always become. (Remember the general mood and level of 

courtesy on display in U.S. airports before Sept. 11?)

<P>Maybe worse, our impatience with genuine healing robs us of the opportunity 

to reflect deeply, over a series of events, not just over the last month. It 

cheats us of the chance to learn something useful about ourselves and perhaps 

our place in the human family.

<P>In our haste to right the terrible wrong that was inflicted on us by 

suicidal terrorists two weeks ago -- to do something, anything, that will 

mitigate our pain -- how much time have we spent assessing all the killing 

that's been done in the name of somebody's God?

<P>How many lists have we made of individuals and nations who started out as 

our "friends" but somehow ended up among our vicious enemies -- many equipped 

with weapons and know-how they got from us? How thoroughly have we explored 

the reasons for these realignments?

<P>Is it always somebody else's fault? Has the United States truly managed in 

its short 225-year history to transcend human imperfection, selfishness and 

poor judgment? Have we become a nation of ubermensch, incapable of error, in 

need of no one's counsel but our own?

<P>As we behold a 40 percent jump in the president's approval ratings -- 

literally overnight -- how far back into other times of crisis do any of us 

care to look for the transformative, but temporary, power of a people's fear? 

Doesn't it feel so much better to rally 'round and focus on the commander-in-

chief's sudden confidence and "leadership style" rather than on what he and 

his advisers are actually doing?

<P>In our longing for a quick return to stability, in our characteristic 

desire to answer all the big questions within 72 hours and appropriate the 

billions needed to implement the answers, we are taking the usual shortcuts. 

Because we cannot bear the pain of uncertainty (let alone of self-analysis) or 

tolerate the tediousness of authentic healing, we hurry all the faster towards 

our goal: Not to live with what has happened to us, but to get over it a.s.a.p.

<P>Here, take a pill. Better yet, buy something; that will not only cheer you 

up, it will help the economy as well.</p>
