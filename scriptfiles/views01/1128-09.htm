There is an eerie quiet across the land.&nbsp; The chance of a second

major terrorist attack is somewhere between “very likely” and “100%

guaranteed,” according to the people we pay with our tax dollars to know

such things.&nbsp; I feel like I am on a huge bus heading straight toward

a cliff.&nbsp; We could suggest that the driver steer in a different

direction.&nbsp; But no one wants to talk about it.

<p>

Perhaps this is a school bus, where the kids sit quietly because they

don’t want to make the driver mad.&nbsp; Back in early October, news

leaked out that intelligence officials told Congress another attack was

100% certain, if we attacked Afghanistan.&nbsp; The driver -- the

president -- got very mad, indeed.&nbsp; He threatened to limit

Congressional briefings drastically (and then backed off).&nbsp; But Bush

spokesman Ari Fleischer had already warned:&nbsp; “People have to watch

what they say.”&nbsp;&nbsp; The news media got the message.&nbsp; Some

things are better left unmentioned - even impending disaster.

<p>

Or perhaps we believe that changing direction won’t help anyway.&nbsp;

The president has tried to convince us that nothing we do can influence

the terrorists.&nbsp; Sometimes he describes them as Nazis, bent on

conquering us because they hate our freedoms.&nbsp; Sometimes he paints

them as inhuman demons, bent on evil for evil’s sake.&nbsp; In either

case, there is no way to deter them from their appointed villainy; we are

on a bus with no steering wheel.&nbsp; Most Americans seem to believe

that.

<p>

But let’s suppose Osama bin Laden speaks for the criminals.&nbsp; (If he

doesn’t, current U.S. policy is pointless.)&nbsp;&nbsp; He does not try

to tell us how we should live here at home.&nbsp; He does define specific

new policy directions he wants us to take in his part of the world:&nbsp;

get U.S. troops out of Saudi Arabia; end bombing and sanctions in Iraq;

stop supporting Israeli occupation of Palestinian territory.&nbsp; These

may or may not be wise policies for us.&nbsp; But they are not wholly

unthinkable.&nbsp; And they might give us a chance of veering away from

the cliff.&nbsp; Aren’t they worth talking about?&nbsp; 

<p>

Some say this would be appeasement.&nbsp; Do we want to send others the

message that terrorism pays?&nbsp; But put the question another

way:&nbsp; Do we want to send the message that, on rare occasions when

our government's policies drive people to suicidal desperation and

homicidal rage, we will at least discuss those policies?&nbsp; When our

policies put thousands of American lives at risk, don’t we want to weigh

the wisdom of those policies against the potential loss of life?&nbsp;

Why not send that message?&nbsp; Is it unreasonable?&nbsp; 

<p>

There is surely no guarantee that a change in U.S. policies would avert

the next attack.&nbsp; But it might.&nbsp; If staying the present course

means a certainty of another attack (as Congress was told), then the math

is simple:&nbsp; changing policies makes us relatively safer than

continuing the present policies.

<p>

Of course safety may not be the highest value.&nbsp; Our present policies

in Saudi Arabia, Iraq, and Israel may be so important that they are worth

the loss of thousands more American lives.&nbsp; But that is a decision

for all of us passengers on the bus to make.&nbsp; This is a democracy,

where the driver is suppose to heed the majority will.&nbsp; If we leave

all decisions up to the driver, we give up the democratic freedom we are

supposedly defending.&nbsp; And it looks like the driver is hell-bent to

take us over the cliff.&nbsp; 

<p>

So principle and self-preservation both lead to the same

conclusion.&nbsp; It is time to break the silence and start a national

debate, before it is too late.&nbsp; The alternative is to wait until the

next thousands die.&nbsp; That would be terrible, not only for the

victims and their loved ones, but for the whole nation.&nbsp; After the

next attack, some will insist that the new deaths make the old policies

more sacred and inviolable; to change them would mean that all the

victims died in vain.&nbsp; Others will be equally convinced that we must

change policies as the only way of avoiding further catastrophe.&nbsp;

The more deaths, the more polarized we will become.&nbsp; Anyone old

enough to remember the Vietnam war knows that.&nbsp; 

<p>

We can insist that the driver turn the wheel in a new direction.&nbsp;

Perhaps we should insist.&nbsp; Perhaps not.&nbsp; But surely now, while

we can still talk to each other, is the time to start talking about

it.&nbsp;&nbsp;
