Four days to go and voter rage is stalking the land, and not just outside the oil refineries. What is it about this election that has really got our collective goat? Intelligent people who are normally fascinated by politics have stopped reading the papers or listening to the radio until the election is over. Why do responsible adults run screaming from the TV when a politician appears on it?<p>Well, any way you look at it, this has been a pretty dismal campaign. This first general election of the millennium has been part freak-show, part boreathon. It has been a vision-free bookkeepers' election in which politicians, the odd left hook aside, have spent their time picking nits out of each other's economic programmes and exchanging statistics no-one believes. Instead of appealing to our higher faculties and social conscience, the campaigns have grubbed about in our pockets, offering a little bit more here, a little bit less there. The party machines have been working flat-out -- not coming up with big ideas, but undermining other people's.<p>Small wonder people turn off when politicians are allowed only to parrot the same handful of slogans and homilies that their pollsters tell them will influence swing voters. 'All spin and no delivery', 'No return to boom and bust', 'We stand for Scotland'; They use these phrases again and again until they drive everyone mad. The success story of this campaign has been Charles Ken nedy because he said from day one that he wasn't going to play the same game. Even Tony Blair seems to realise that contrived encounters with 'real people' pre-selected by his party workers are a national turn-off.<p>A number of Scots have remarked that this election has seemed to be something taking place in a land far away. And it has sometimes felt like looking down the wrong end of the telescope. It started with Tony Blair's toe-curling homily to St Olave's, after which the campaign descended into a dialogue of the deaf over taxation and spending. John Prescott then captured the imagination of the nation by punching the lights out of a countryside campaigner.<p>Politics turned into blood sport as interviewers tried to outdo each other in humiliation of William Hague. Lately, it has been more like the night of the living dead. A procession of past-it politicians, notably Baroness Thatcher, has passed across the screens to the bemused contempt of the electorate. The belated arrival on the scene of the fuel protesters somehow seemed a fitting conclusion to a curmudgeonly campaign.<p>This election will be memorable for one thing at least: it will almost certainly register the lowest turnout in British electoral history. Never have people been more disengaged from the electoral process. Only 18% of under-25s intend to vote. The vast majority of voters say they are disillusioned at Labour's performance -- feel cheated, even -- though they see no alternative but to re-elect them.<p>Never has there been such mistrust of politicians; such contempt, cynicism, ridicule. It is as if we have all, as a nation, turned into satirists who swap Private Eye jokes instead of discussing political issues. We talk knowingly about how politicians are presenting themselves, as if we were all spin-doctors manquZ<caron>. About how Labour is tailoring its message to Mondeo Man, Worcester Woman or Pebbledash Britain. Politics is something remote, divorced from our lives, a meaningless display of sound and fury, signifying nothing.<p>Yet the paradox is that what has been going on beneath the surface of this election has been far from meaningless. This is in many ways a watershed election. If Labour wins its expected second landslide it will mark the end of a century of Conservative hegemony. Labour has never won two full successive terms before. Labour governments of the past -- 1924, 1945, 1964, 1974 -- have been brief respites in the long march of the right. But 2001 looks like the end of the road.<p>The Tories must change or die. Factions are already preparing for the internecine warfare that will commence early on Friday morning. The Tories are looking increasingly like Labour in 1981, when the gang of four finally broke the mould by creating the SDP. History could be about to repeat itself.<p><p>It could be the end of the line for public services as well -- at least, as we know them. That might seem a curious thing to say at the very moment when Labour has committed vast sums to making those services work. Indeed, another distinguishing feature of campaign 2001 is that it has been the first election for decades which has been fought over who will improve public services most, rather than who will tax us least.<p>However, in this campaign Labour has opened the way for private capital to enter what used to be the the exclusive realms of state provision: the NHS and schools. The manifesto plans for privately managed surgical units mark a radical departure, even for New Labour. Not surprisingly, the health sector unions are appalled at what they regard as wholesale privatisation.<p>Schools, and not just failing ones, are to be handed over to private companies. It is being done in the name of competition and improving the quality of services. But the very nature and limits of the state are being redefined in this election.<p>At least, they are in England. For this is also a watershed election in terms of Scotland's relations with the rest of the UK. The passages on private provision of health care were surgically removed from the Scottish Labour manifesto. Private health factories aren't going to happen here, nor are privately run state schools. Scotland is not buying into this particular public-private partnership.<p>A different election has been running in Scotland. Here the debate has been about fiscal autonomy and whether the Scottish parliament should repatriate taxation. We have heard the first admission from a minister -- Scottish secretary Helen Liddell -- that the Barnett squeeze is going to cut Scotland's relative share of public spending. The campaign for the 2003 Scottish parliamentary elections has already started.<p>But Scotland hasn't ceased to be part of the UK. Indeed, the existence of a different political culture in Scotland has begun to make an impact on England. Labour's Mo Mowlem has publicly endorsed the Scottish Executive's restoration of hardship grants and abolition of student fees. Charles Kennedy's campaign has been fought over the achievements of our much-maligned Scottish Executive in areas like care of the elderly. Holyrood shows that it can do things in a different way. At least, until the money runs out.<p>Nor will Britain's relations with Europe ever be the same again after this election. The Tories have failed to rouse the sleeping English bulldog with warnings of British sovereignty being extinguished. William Hague tried to turn the general election into a referendum on saving the pound -- and then hastily retracted when he realised that the pound might very well lose.<p>We have discovered that our opposition to the single currency may be wide, but it is also very shallow. According to the polls, most people expect Britain to be a member within the next 10 years anyway.<p><p>The Conservatives are already fracturing over Europe as the silent Europhiles -- Patten, Dorrell, Clarke -- regain their voice. After another landslide, Tony Blair will have no excuse to delay his referendum, much as he would perhaps like to prolong Tory agony. And when he calls it, he will win. Which could mean the greatest change in the political destiny of this island nation in two centuries.<p>Still bored? Strange, isn't it, but historically speaking, elections don't come much more significant than this. But somehow none of this has quite got across to the electorate. Perhaps we had all made up our minds already. Perhaps we were all eager for Labour to stop talking and just get on with it.<p>Perhaps too, we have become more sophisticated as an electorate than we were even in the 1990s. We are now all experts in artifice and spin, the manipulative arts; we are all able to read behind the slogans and speeches to see the political manipulators at work. We all saw through the contrived campaign launch at St Olave's: its phoney religiosity, the exploitation of school pupils too young even to vote.<p>It is as if the entire political process had become transparent. We know all about how politicians try to use devious imagery and 'warm words' to send our critical faculties to sleep. We all know that statistics are worse than damned lies. We don't expect politicians to answer questions. We can see Gordon Brown coming a mile off when he waffles about not having any plans to raise National Insurance contributions, or Michael Portillo when says he has no plans to raise VAT. We know how stealth taxes work, and we know how Labour tries to bamboozle us with them. Though on the whole we would prefer to be bamboozled by Labour than by the Tories.<p>Political advertising used to be regarded as a kind of magic. Sir Tim Bell would come up with a clever image and the people would all lie down before it. 'Labour Isn't Working', 'Labour's Tax Bombshell', etc. But the truth is that political advertising isn't working any more. The Tories' negative election broadcasts, suggesting that Labour were causing rapes and that schoolchildren were all drug dealers, were dismissed with disgust by the electorate. There has been no memorable political image in this campaign -- except perhaps that of the hapless Malcolm Rifkind standing before that poster advertising Tesco.<p>Kinnock -- The Movie, which moistened the eyes of the nation back in 1987, couldn't happen now. We are too wise to allow our emotions to be tugged by clever cinematography. Blair -- The Movie should have been dropped. William Hague is an intelligent man and a powerful politician who has been turned into a figure of fun by botched attempts to spin his image -- those baseball hats, that EastEnders haircut, those 14 pints. We are one step ahead of Amanda Platell (his women's magazine spin adviser) and despise Hague because of his synthesised image. We are similarly turned off by Tony Blair -- 'phoney Tony'. However, Blair has at least been through a few real-life, un-spun challenges -- Clause 4, Kosovo, fuel protests, foot-and-mouth -- from which he emerged as a leader capable of making the lonely decisions.<p>It is unthinkable that we could have another election like this again. Just because the Berlin Wall has come down it doesn't mean that we have all become cretins. The focus groups, message polls, and spin doctors turned politics into something as synthetic as a McDonald's burger and fries, and we just can't keep it down any more.<p>Big Mac politics is dead, and we don't yet know what will replace it. But politicians and the media -- who have been the accessories to this perversion of democracy -- simply have to raise their game. Perhaps this is the real watershed in this election. In future, sincerity is the new spin.
