Last summer's Republican convention was applauded and condemned for the

large number of African-Americans showcased. Critics claimed it was a

deceptive performance ("minstrel show" was a popular put-down) but others

praised the GOP's attempt at racial outreach.

<P>

   Whatever it was, the strategy failed to attract many black voters to the

Republican ticket. Texas Gov. George W. Bush pulled just 9 percent of the

black vote, the fewest garnered by a Republican since the second term of

Ronald Reagan, a man loathed by most African-Americans. Even in Texas, where

Bush was reputed to have crafted an effective interracial alliance, he polled

merely 5 percent of the black vote.

<P>



   Many Republicans strategists are wondering what went wrong. Why did

African-Americans, particularly the black middle class, resist the Republican

embrace so resolutely? And, since they did, why should the GOP continue to

make gestures of racial outreach when its hand is consistently rejected?

<P>

   The answer to that question is simple: It must. The GOP can never claim to

be a national party unless it can attract a national constituency. Oh, it can

gain control (as it has) over all three branches of the federal government,

and it may use that brute political force to push its policies through. But in

order to be truly representative, Republicans must earn--through policy, not

symbolism-- the support of Americans across all spectra, especially the racial

spectrum.

<P>

   What's more, changing demographics make it clear that white Americans, not

just white Republicans, will be a minority in this country in the next 50

years. If either party is to ensure long-term durability, it will have to gain

a significant following among "minority" Americans. Unless the GOP mounts a

serious challenge, the Democratic Party will be the party of the future, by

default.

<P>

   This means the party of Lincoln must stop exploiting white resentment to

blacks' demands for civil rights, a la the "Southern strategy," and begin

serious efforts to find solutions to our continuing racial impasse. The

inclusive, "opportunity conservatism" pushed by 1996 GOP vice presidential

candidate Jack Kemp, for example, was attractive to many in the black

community and should have been absorbed as official Republican strategy.

Instead, with the "Gingrich revolution," the GOP re-engaged the power of the

white backlash to help fuel its political bandwagon.

<P>

   Were that to change, the Democrats must then resist the temptation to

exploit African-Americans' racial fears, a tactic that paid big dividends in

this year's presidential election. Demonizing Bush was the low road, but it's

a road well traveled by backlash strategists.

<P>

   Bush's handlers understand this need for change; that's why the

president-elect selected two black Americans as his first cabinet members,

despite the black electorate's rejection of his candidacy. His choices of

Condoleezza Rice and retired Gen. Colin Powell as national security adviser

and secretary of state, respectively, stir both pride and anxiety within the

African-American community. Pride, because the exceptionally qualified duo

were chosen to fill slots not typically associated with black officials;

Powell will be the third-highest-ranking official in the Executive Branch.

Worry, because many African-American activists fear Republicans are trying to

camouflage harmful policies with black faces, as with U.S. Supreme Court

Justice Clarence Thomas.

<P>

   When the first President Bush nominated Thomas for a spot on the U.S.

Supreme Court, blacks by and large supported him; his race trumped his

Republican pedigree. Today, however, there is a widespread consensus among

blacks that Thomas has been a disaster for the interests of African-Americans.

Racial symbolism is regarded a bit more warily these days.

<P>

   Powell supports affirmative action and credits it for aiding his rise. In

that, he differs from Thomas, who now wants to kick down the same ladder of

affirmative action he climbed to his lofty perch. But in other ways, Powell's

history is cause for even more concern among African-Americans than Thomas'.

Powell had a major role in supporting right-wing terrorism in Guatemala, El

Salvador and Nicaragua during the 1980s; in helping to design the Reagan

administration's 1983 invasion of Grenada (an action by the Western

hemisphere's largest nation against the hemisphere's smallest); in leading the

1989 invasion of Panama which killed hundreds of (mostly black) Panamanians,

leaving thousands wounded and homeless. Rice has less to live down, but her

connection to the GOP's foreign-policy brain trust makes many wary.

<P>

   If those fears turn out to be baseless, the GOP may be on its way to

becoming a truly national party.
