In 1998, Trillium Asset Management Corporation (TAMC) attended a

shareholder meeting at California-based Unocal Corporation.  TAMC was

protesting a gas pipeline deal that would have put millions of dollars into

the hands of a regime that oppressed women and ethnic minorities, sponsored

the opium trade, and had connections to terrorists. The proposed partner was

Afghanistan's fledgling Taliban regime. The pipeline would have transported

natural gas from Turkmenistan to Pakistan's Persian Gulf ports. Two months

later, Unocal suspended the project, and by year's end, ended it altogether.



        

        <p>By Unocal's own admission, the deal would have meant $50 to $100

million in annual revenues to the Taliban  over a quarter of a billion

dollars by the time of the September 11th attacks on the World Trade Center

and the Pentagon.  At the time, the only groups protesting the deal were a

coalition of activists and TAMC.  Not the State Department (sanctions had

yet to be imposed) nor Wall Street.  

        

       <p> Unfortunately, Unocal's ill-fated deal with the Taliban was not an

isolated incident.  The world is littered with similar partnerships.  Just

last year social investors, human rights activists, environmental groups and

national security experts joined forces to protest the initial public

offering of PetroChina Co., a subsidiary of China's mammoth state-owned oil

company, China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC).  CNPC owns 90% of

PetroChina Co.  Investors in the Goldman Sachs- led IPO now own the rest.

        

       <p> CNPC has ties to the Sudan, a one-time haven of Osama bin Laden and

a state subject to sanctions by the U.S.  Since PetroChina is controlled by

CNPC, the IPO freed up capital for CNPC's operations in the Sudan and

elsewhere.  It is estimated that CNPC has invested over $700 million dollars

developing Sudanese oil fields  a boon to the war torn nation.  Under

pressure from activists, however, the IPO raised only $2.9 billion dollars

half of what CNPC was expecting.   

        

       <p> Policing companies that do business with oppressive regimes is a

matter of principle for socially responsible investment (SRI) managers like

TAMC, but it is also an investment strategy.  Companies themselves are faced

with these decisions all the time. More often than not, they fail the test.

In Germany, U.S.-owned companies helped Adolf Hitler rather than oppose him.

After World War II, Swiss banks made no effort to find heirs of slaughtered

Jews who had accounts with them; they simply took their money.  It took

years for Nike to recognize that the people protesting working conditions in

their Asian plants had a legitimate gripe.  And so it is today with the oil

fields beneath the Sudan and those accessible through Afghanistan.

        

        <p>Arguments are always made that capitalism fosters democracy.  In

reality, it is more often the reverse.  Capitalism, by itself, is just a

system to make money.  If it is imposed without respect for basic human

rights, it lacks the restraint to create a balance between human and natural

resources. 

        

       <p> As a result of the September 11th attacks, the United States has

been forced to cope with unspeakable loss and the prospects of war with a

nation-less enemy. The Nation must also learn to defend itself from attack

while at the same time defending civil rights.  

        

        <p>For SRI managers, the September 11th attacks underscored the

importance of putting pressure on companies that support oppressive regimes

or don't uphold the ideals of democracy, freedom and human rights. Some

things are always worth fighting for.
