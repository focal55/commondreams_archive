The Bush Administration's energy proposal

is the latest in a series of initiatives that give

"transparency" in government a whole new

meaning. Campaign contributors are cashing in on

their investments, and every week is "payback"

week.



         <p>It's taken quite a stretch to use electricity

shortages as an excuse for drilling the Artic

National Wildlife Refuge, but George W. Bush and

Dick Cheney are making a heroic effort. So what if

only 3 percent or our electricity comes from oil?

The more relevant number here is 78 percent: that's

how much of the oil and gas industry's record $32.6

million contribution went to Republicans in the last

election cycle.



         <p>The Administration's arguments about

energy security don't hold up much better. Drilling

the Wildlife Refuge full of oil wells would not have

much impact on oil or gasoline prices, since oil

prices are determined in a world market.



         <p>The supply impact would be minimal and no

different from oil obtained anywhere else in the

world; and OPEC could always cut back production

to compensate for it. Of course, if we were really

concerned about long-term energy security, the best

strategy would be to leave the oil in the ground, in

case imports are not so readily available some day.



         <p>But this is not energy planning -- if it were,

we'd see more than the token one-tenth of one

percent of our energy dollars allocated to

developing renewable energy sources such as solar

and wind. Or conservation: five of the nation's top

laboratories have estimated that we can reduce the

growth in electricity demand by 20 to 47 percent by

increasing energy efficiency.



         <p>These scientists didn't get any face time with

Dick Cheney when the secretive Energy

Development Task Force -- dubbed the "Alaska

jihad" by its leaders -- put together the

Administration's proposal. But Kenneth Lay,

chairman of Enron Corp. got a half hour with the

Vice President to lobby for what he wanted.



         <p>The proposal sees deregulation -- the cause

of California's soaring electricity prices -- as the

way of the future. And why not? Consumers got

fleeced for billions of dollars, and a good chunk of

it went to Enron -- an excellent return on their $1.7

million contribution to Republicans in the last

election, as well as their long-term investments in

Mr. Bush's political career.



         <p>There will be no price caps to protect

consumers from the effects of deregulation, even

though the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission

has the power to do that, and even to force a

refunding of money already ripped off.



         <p>There will be no closing of the loophole that

allows SUV's and pick-up trucks to be exempt from

Federal mileage standards -- just ask White House

Chief of Staff Andrew Card, former chief lobbyist

for the auto industry.



         <p>The Administration's energy policy seems to

be based on the same strategy as its economic

policy. Faced with a real short-term problem, do

nothing to resolve it, but use it to sell long-term

changes that reward your friends. The Bush tax cut

will do little or nothing to counter the current

economic slowdown, instead rewriting the tax code

to give hundreds of billions of dollars to the richest

people in America over the next decade.



         <p>Then there was the bankruptcy bill: a timely

gift to credit card companies at the expense of

millions of people (median income: $22,000) who

are unable to make ends meet -- mostly due to loss

of a job, poor health, or divorce. Kick 'em while

they're down. The credit card giant MBNA was the

largest corporate contributor to the Bush campaign.



         <p>Meanwhile, the pharmaceutical companies

have been using their clout to block a universal

Medicare prescription drug benefit. And the Wall

Street firms that would rake in billions from

privatizing Social Security got one of the most

stacked presidential commissions in history --

unanimously pro-privatization -- to fix a problem

that doesn't even exist.



         <p>That's how our free market election system

works: you vote with your dollars. President Bush

has made it easier than ever to "follow the money,"

but the media has been mostly kind to him.

Alternating between the confused look of a student

who knows he is faking it, and that impish gleam,

he has charmed the press and rides high in the polls.



         <p>And he does deliver some good jokes. "You

can fool some of the people all of the time -- Mr.

Bush quipped at a Washington dinner -- "and those

are the ones you want to concentrate on."



         <p>Too bad he wasn't kidding.
