The clock is running out for Jack Welch, CEO of General Electric. It is

also winding down for Don Morrison, a dairy farmer in upstate New York.



<p>For two decades, Welch has led the one-time appliance company,

transforming it into the world's most transnationalized conglomerate with

a finance subsidiary as its profit center. The subject of almost

unqualified adulation from the media and market analysts, he may end his

tenure with a loud thud.



<p>Scheduled to retire this year, Welch extended his reign by an additional

year to oversee GE's gobbling up of Honeywell. European regulators are now

raising serious concerns about the monopolistic effects of the deal, and

appear poised to block it. Welch, who has made his reputation by pushing

all cost-cutting and market-dominating measures to the extreme, may find

that, in his final act, the law and society finally set some limits on

him.



<p>Don Morrison knows all too well the effect of Welch's hard-driving effort

to cut expenses and externalize costs, and he hopes it is not only the

European antitrust regulators who find the spine to stand up to Welch.



<p>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is expected in August to

issue a final decision on whether it will dredge the Hudson River to clean

up a GE-created PCB mess on the river bed -- at a cost of $460 million to

GE.



<p>Until 1976, a broad array of U.S. manufacturers used PCBs (polychlorinated

biphenyls) for insulation in electrical equipment. In 1976, Congress

banned their manufacture and sale, following evidence that PCBs cause

cancer and other harmful health effects. Since the banning, new evidence

suggests PCBs also disrupt the endocrine system and lower intelligence

levels of children exposed in the womb.



<p>From the 1940s to 1976, GE dumped 1.3 million pounds of PCBs into the

Hudson River, creating what is now the nation's largest Superfund site.



<p>Don Morrison knows all about it. "Twenty-five years ago," he says, "the

state dug sludge out of the river, and put it on land adjoining mine. I

figured if they let them put it in the river, it can't be that bad. So it

didn't bother me. É When they asked permission to push it [against my

house], I said sure. My kids played in it, they grew up in it."



<p>Don Morrison's wife died of colon cancer at the age of 49. "We can't prove

it, but we believe that PCB had a tremendous amount to do with it." Now he

lives in fear that his children will suffer from a similar fate.



<p>Morrison and other survivors want GE at least to remedy the problem, 25

years after PCBs were outlawed in the United States.



<p>In December 2000, EPA announced that it agreed, saying that after 16 years

of studies, it had determined to clean up a 40-mile stretch of the Hudson.

Under the Superfund law, GE would be liable for the costs of cleanup.



<p>GE claims that it supports cleaning the river, and that it has acted

responsibly to reduce its daily PCB pollution to three ounces. But it says

dredging will stir up sediments and make the problem worse.



<p>EPA retorts that the ongoing public health and environmental consequences

of the PCB pollution are severe, with PCBs at river bottom continuing to

enter the food chain. New technologies, agency experts say, address

concerns about spreading contaminants by dredging.



<p>But GE isn't just making arguments. In fine Jack Welch style, GE has

pulled out all the stops to block the dredging plan. GE's Hudson River

lobbying dream team includes former Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell

and former House Appropriations Committee Chair Robert Livingston. Among

other hardball tactics, the company deployed NBC President and GE Vice

Chair Robert Wright to lobby New York City Council members against a bill

endorsing the dredging project. (Think direct intervention from the head

of a TV network, which owns a major station in New York, might give GE

some leverage?)



<p>GE certainly has lots of friends in the Bush administration, and in the

Congress.



<p>On the other hand, EPA chief Christine Todd Whitman endorsed the dredging

when she was governor of New Jersey. And the Bush administration is under

pressure not to announce any more environmentally stupid and harmful

policy decisions with an obvious tilt to corporate interests. So the

outcome of the final EPA decision remains very much in doubt.



<p>The GE of Jack Welch has made its mark by pushing it workers, suppliers

and the law to the limit, and often beyond.



<p>But his strategies, though lavishly praised by Wall Street, are basically

inhuman, as Don Morrison and many others can testify.



<p>As Jack Welch's reign comes to an end, it is time for the society to say

the clock has run out on Welch's model of comprehensive and global

management by stress. The first way to deliver that message is for EPA to

authorize the go-ahead of the Hudson dredging, without delay.
