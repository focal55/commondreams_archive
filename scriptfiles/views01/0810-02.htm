The brouhaha involving alleged Republican meddling in Green Party campaigns in order to rob the Democrats of needed votes is just the kind of tempest in a teapot that turns voters off.
<p>The disaffected citizenry, in turn, leaves the back door wide open for big business to run the country by default (as well as by design). </p>
<p>Frankly, most of my friends and Ravenna neighbors have more important things to worry about than the shenanigans of political consultants trying to infiltrate other people's parties.</p>
<p>What is at issue is not the fascinating sense of ethics of some Republicans, as ably articulated by State Republican Party Chairman Chris Vance: "Working to make sure you get the right mixture of candidates on the ballot is a tactic that goes as far back as the dawn of democracy." Huh?</p>
<p>Nor is the real issue the supposed gullibility of Greens such as Green candidate Young Han, an 18-year-old from the 21st District. </p>
<p>I doubt we want a society in which 18-year-olds seek an enemy behind every bush, or eye every free lunch with suspicion. Young is indeed young, and is also bright, idealistic and committed to transforming society. We need more candidates like him, willing to roll up their shirt sleeves and dedicate themselves to public service.</p>
<p>Nor is the real issue whether the South King County Green Party was too inclusive in letting Republicans in Green guise organize and pay for an unofficial "convention" that ended up attempting to recruit a non-Green (from his sickbed) to run as a Green candidate. </p>
<p>Most Greens would probably prefer to err on the side of inclusion and get stung once in a while than run a cliquish in-crowd type of politics.</p>
<p>The real issue in today's politics is why and how you play the game. Many of us were astonished last year when a fundamentally decent, authentic, honest person ran for president and remained honest throughout and beyond his campaign. Locally, Joe Szwaja galvanized supporters for his U.S. congressional run against Jim McDermott for the same reason. </p>
<p>In my neighborhood, people have become so jaded by politics as usual that "honest politician" has become an oxymoron.</p>
<p>Manipulating young Green candidates may very well be a part of the traditional Republican repertoire, as Vance suggests. Calling "foul" to the newspapers may be part of the traditional Democratic repertoire. </p>
<p>In the meantime, the local Green parties are working hard to find good, decent, honest, authentic people to run for office and serve the public.</p>
<p>While Rs and Ds continue to sling mud and play games, the Greens will continue working patiently for Instant Runoff Voting, election reform and a myriad of critical issues that affect the quality of everyday life for the voters in our state and city. We invite the big kids to get out of the sandbox and join us. </p>
<p>What are these issues that real people care about? My friends and neighbors want to know that their food is safe to eat, that their clothing was not made in sweatshops, that they can get a job with a decent wage, that they can get to work without getting stuck in traffic, that schools are free of advertising gimmicks, that old, sick and troubled people in Seattle have a place to live, and that the police are treating people fairly. </p>
<p>In short, people want to know that we in Seattle have pledged to take care of each other and the earth under our feet. </p>
<p>We are Green, but we weren't born yesterday. We know the stakes are too high for real people in Seattle to have much patience for nonsense. Let's get on with democracy.</p>
