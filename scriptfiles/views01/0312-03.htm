ONE OF EVERY thousand high-risk Americans could develop cancer from 

the toxic chemical dioxin, according to a landmark study the Environmental 

Protection Agency is preparing to make official. Even more worrisome, the 

study warns, are dioxin's effects on the thyroids and immune systems of 

children.

<P>Ten years in the making, EPA's dioxin study is a political hot potato for 

the Bush administration.

<P>Issue the study, and the administration angers its allies in the chemical, 

paper and other dioxin-producing industries, who will surely face calls for 

stricter regulation. Bury the study, and environmental activists will cry 

coverup, further damaging the administration's shaky credibility on the mom-

and-apple-pie issue of environmental protection.

<P>How President Bush and EPA administrator Christine Todd Whitman handle this 

dilemma is important in its own right.

<P>But their decision will also shed light on the administration's policy 

toward the international treaty on persistent organic pollutants, or POPs, 

that 122 nations, including the United States, negotiated last year.

<P>The treaty, which calls for eliminating dioxin and other toxics "wherever 

feasible," will be signed in May in Stockholm by environmental ministers of 

signatory countries. Will Whitman be among them?

<P>There is irony in all this for Bush, for the dioxin study was initiated in 

1991 during his father's presidency. What's more, Bush Senior and his EPA 

chief, William Reilly, ordered the study at the specific behest of the 

chemical industry, which complained that environmentalists' calls for limits 

on dioxin were based on hype, not sound science. But now that the study is 

near completion, it is unwelcome in corporate boardrooms.

<P>"Industry pushed for this study as a way to stall tougher regulations," 

says Rick Hind of Greenpeace, one of 411 groups that recently wrote Bush, 

urging the study's release. "Dioxin has gone from being a `possible' to a 

`known' human carcinogen, and the risks of cancer have increased tenfold."

<P>Dioxin first attracted public attention during the Vietnam War; it was the 

contaminant in the defoliant Agent Orange. The chemical's reputation worsened 

in the 1980s, when it caused the evacuation of the Love Canal neighbors in 

upstate New York.

<P>Dioxin is formed whenever chlorinated compounds are burned. It remains 

ubiquitous because it is a byproduct of so many industrial processes. 

Production of PVC plastic - the plastic used in water pipes and credit cards - 

is a leading source of dioxin.

<P>So is the operation of waste incinerators, steel plants and paper mills 

that use chlorine as a bleaching agent.

<P>Every person on Earth has dioxin in his system. The chemical lodges in the 

fatty tissues of animals that consume contaminated water and plants; it also 

accumulates through the food chain. Humans who eat lots of fatty foods or fish 

therefore end up with the highest body burdens. Exposure is especially high 

for people, often poor or nonwhite or both, living near industrial facilities 

(46 percent of the nation's public housing projects are situated within a mile 

of toxic factories, according to a University of Texas-Dallas study.)

<P>So, will the EPA study see the light of day? In truth, its contents are no 

secret. A working draft is on the agency's Web site, and the media has 

reported on it. But the study has no legal standing until the EPA formally 

approves it. Taking that step would oblige the EPA to incorporate the study's 

findings into its regulations, and therein lies the rub.

<P>Bush and Whitman have records of skepticism toward regulations that 

restrict corporations' freedom of action. As governor of New Jersey, Whitman 

removed approximately 1,000 chemicals from a "right to know" law that required 

companies to inform residents about toxics used in their communities.

<P>Whitman disparaged the law as bureaucratic overkill, claiming it listed 

such trivial items as lipstick. But sodium hydrosulfate was also on the list, 

and in 1995 it caused an explosion at a factory in the town of Lodi that 

killed five workers and caused evacuation of 400 residents.

<P>Criticizing regulation is easy in the abstract, but real people can end up 

paying a terrible price for lack of proper regulation. It's terrible and 

unnecessary, for the costs of changing production patterns are often 

overstated. In Europe, bleaching of paper has been virtually eliminated 

without economic pain, an experience that doubtless fueled governments' 

enthusiasm for the POPs treaty. Here in the Bay Area, the governments of San 

Francisco, Oakland, Berkeley and Marin County have passed resolutions calling 

for the elimination of dioxin wherever possible.

<P>Bush and Whitman can score points with voters, who overwhelmingly support 

environmental protection - if they reconsider their skepticism of regulation, 

release the dioxin study and sign the POPs treaty. The chemical and paper 

industries may not be happy, but surely that should matter less than the 

health of the American people.
