We are having a Ramadan Thanksgiving this year.  

	

<p>Ramadan does not overlap with Thanksgiving very often, and this year

the combination sticks in our throats.  Fasting and feasting.  The

secular American holiday, the holy Islamic holiday.  Turkey dinners for

American families, packets of rations and relief supplies for families

in Afghanistan.  War and peace.  Life and death.  This is not melodrama

or exaggeration.  It's the news of the day.

	

<p>The gap between the haves and the have-nots feels greater than usual. 

Distances between cultures have grown wider.  All of a sudden, places on

the planet seem farther apart.  Afghanistan doesn't have many telephones

or televisions or Internet connections.

	

<p>Some people want a rest from the world that Sept. 11 brought to our

attention, relief from having our lifestyle disturbed.  Our national

nervous system is so unaccustomed to such distractions that these past 9

weeks of stress is too much to endure.  I heard that there is general

mental instability in the U.S. as a result of Sept. 11, a rise in

anxiety disorders, an increase in domestic violence and child abuse.

	

<p>There will probably be people who say that if we don't celebrate

Thanksgiving with gusto, even with red-white-and-blue trimmings, the

terrorists will have won.  As if we could eat our way into patriotism.

	

<p>Maybe this year we should do it differently.  We need a Thanksgiving

that looks beyond the usual national self-congratulations, beyond the

United States, and certainly beyond Americans who will be eating well. 

The CDC reported in JAMA in September that 56.4% of Americans are

overweight, 19.8% are clinically obese.  Only one state, Colorado, has

an obesity rate under 15%.    

	

<p>We could reflect on this.  

	

<p>Many people are affected by the assaults of September 11, 2001.  About

5000 people from 86 countries died, over 6000 were treated in hospitals,

over 35,000 people had to physically run from direct death and injury

that morning.  In October, 79,000 people in New York City reported

losing their jobs (NYT, Nov. 16).  These people have family and friends,

social and business connections, adding up to maybe 50 million people. 

Many more are affected by various ripple effects.

	

<p>Many people are in shock and in grief.  In many cultures a mourning

period is one, two, three years.  Modern societies have shortened

traditional mourning periods.  They say people need to get back to work,

back to normal.  But their psyches don't always get the memo. 

	

<p>As a society and a country we are at war with terror, terrorism,

terrorists.  Terrorism is a deliberate calculated effort to

terrify/terrorize other people.  It is not a fair fight.  It is the

willful intent to destabilize other people's lives, to unnerve them.  It

is a form of violence akin to torture.  It is terrible.  

	

<p>Americans are using their flag as a tourniquet around their broken

hearts, as a string around their fingers to remind them that the U.S.

was attacked, as a banner rooting for the battle against terrorists in

Afghanistan.  

	

<p>I hear that Phase One is ending.  As part of our effort to eradicate Al

Qaeda in more than 60 countries we have attacked the Taliban group for

sheltering and hosting Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan.  We are also

trying to close the financial channels used by Al Qaeda.  We are told

this war--like the wars on poverty and cancer--could go on for many

years. 

	

<p>Most Americans have been insulated from war, poverty, and hunger and

know them only from movies and books.  We need to talk about such

things.  More than 95% of the world are not Americans.  We need to

ponder that fact.

	

<p>I attended a series of three weekly community conversations about Sept.

11.

	

<p>"Everyone is going to be pressured to act from their worst self," one

woman said.  "The challenge is to act from our best self, or we'll drag

each other down."

	

<p>Another woman said, "Life goes on."  She means life moves beyond

trouble, gets back on track.  But, I thought, life is not separate from

grief, war, fear, trauma.  Life includes it all.

	

<p>"Love the next person," someone said.

	

<p>Someone said, "If you fear, you can't think clearly."

	

<p>"We need heartwork to help us make choices," said a woman.

<p>Thanksgiving can be a time for heartwork.  Let us speak from the heart

before we eat, after we eat.  When we go back to work let us work from

the heart.  Let us be a country that acts from our heart, lives from our

heart year-round.  Then maybe more people outside America can give

thanks for us.
