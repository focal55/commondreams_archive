THE TITLE of most buffoonish member of Congress is not lightly given because, I

suppose, there are so many contenders.

<P>

    Until this week, everybody's favorite was James A. Traficant, the nominal

Ohio Democrat who votes with the Republican caucus and whose ravings on the

House floor often border on incoherence. But Traficant, who is so original that

even his haircut looks like a space alien's, brings an agreeable degree of

honest eccentricity to a Congress saturated with tedious conventionality.

<P>

    Bob Barr (R-Ga.) is an obvious choice but he ruins his chances for the

prize because he is not as stupid as he is stupefyingly mean.

<P>

    Some people would nominate Dan Burton (R-Ind.), unfairly I would say,

because even the clownish inquisitions his government reform committee

frequently undertakes are honestly reflective of the sturdy right wing Hoosiers

who populate Indiana's Sixth Congressional District.

<P>

    Tom DeLay (R-Texas), the reformed former termite exterminator who says he

used to drink 12 martinis a night, would be on anybody's list for no better

reason than that this self-described "God-centered" man doesn't, it was

recently revealed, even speak to his own mother and three siblings.

<P>

    Still, that's an anecdotal irrelevance compared with the unarguable

effectiveness of his shoot-the-wounded style of House leadership that has

earned him the nickname "the Hammer."

    Now it suddenly appears that the embarrassment of being Congress' worst

embarrassment belongs hands down to an obscure congressman and piece of work

named Jim Hansen (R-Utah). He's the one who went on National Public Radio last

week and, with breathtaking bad taste, trashed Puerto Ricans. What provoked

Hansen was President Bush's decision to stop bombing the island of Vieques to

smithereens but not until 2003.

<P>

    Read Hansen's own words: "I come down to the idea where I don't see where

Puerto Rico should get any favorite treatment over the rest of these people.

<P>

Now what have they done to get it? They sit down there on welfare and very few

of them paying taxes, got a sweetheart deal. I just don't see the equity in it

but maybe I don't understand it."

    There are so many things the thick-witted congressman must not understand

such as the last thing Bush needs is some raving bigot blowing up the bridges

he is so assiduously trying to build to the nation's Hispanic population.

<P>

Hansen expresses the sort of vulgar, ignorant and inelegant philosophy usually

spouted by people who say "All Puerto Ricans are ..." and then fill in the

blanks with whatever vile insult pops into their heads.

<P>

    There are, I suppose, a lot of ignorant people who would make mindless

generalizations about blameless people who live in Utah. These would include

such slanders as Utah is a state full of sex-crazed polygamists or that it is

populated by intolerant fanatics because until recent years black people were

excluded from the Mormon Church.

<P>

    The splendid people of Puerto Rico have seen their language and culture

thrive and prosper in the face of worse insults and patronizing mainland

attitudes. So I hope the good citizens of Utah will rise above the indignities

and shame Hansen invites on them.
