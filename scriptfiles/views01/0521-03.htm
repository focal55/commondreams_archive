Last Tuesday they were celebrating Inglewood's finest hour in more

than a decade: the "grand opening" of a revitalized Market Street, the

main downtown thoroughfare. The band was playing, the balloons were

swaying and the flowering jacaranda trees were framing a picture of a

city on the verge of a renewed civic identity.

<p>Inglewood, City of Champions, put out the welcome mat to show off its

$3.6-million renovation effort and illustrate its urban vitality. Mayor

Roosevelt Dorn said there's "something good in Inglewood." Now if they

could only let the "perception managers" know about it.

<p>What does a city do when outside perceptions cloud its reality? Is it

Inglewood or "Inglehood," Inglewood or "Ingle Watts"? As one who lives in

the adjacent L.A. neighborhood of Westchester, I've been met with puzzled

looks and wide-eyed stares at my residence location. My safety is the

immediate concern. If my address were Bel-Air, Brentwood, Westwood or

Beverly Hills-adjacent, would safety be the topic of conversation? I've

tested the theory, and the other locations lead to excited conversations

about where to shop, eat or do business.

<p>In his book, "Public Opinion," journalist Walter Lippmann wrote: "We

do not first see, and then define, we define first and then see." In

other words, distorting reality is part of the human condition, and it is

the "pictures in our heads" that determine reality.

<p>The pictures in our heads in Los Angeles and its surrounding

communities are of two cities--one of "neighbor-hoods," the other of

neighborhoods. One type of neighborhood is deserving of our attention,

our dollars and our investments--places overwhelmingly white and

affluent. These are the neighborhoods and communities that are desirable,

so much so that even if you aren't lucky enough to live there, you

describe your neighborhood as XYZ-adjacent.

<p>The other Los Angeles holds neighborhoods that are better off left

alone, not to be experienced firsthand lest you become a victim to its

unpredictable cast. These neighborhoods are overwhelmingly African

American and Latino, generally less newsworthy and less visible in the

business and economic buzz circles, but very visible in those pictures in

our heads. Those pictures are often mediated, housed in the Metro

sections of newspapers telling us about yet another disaster over

there--another sad shooting or tragic mishap that triggers the Pavlovian

head nod and the reminder to check our gas gauges if we're ever adjacent

to these areas.

<p>Where one person sees a "hood," others see a neighborhood. Where one

person sees a city on the verge of revitalization and ripe for community

development, others see a city on a desperate or futile path to redefine

itself.

<p>When Lippmann published "Public Opinion" in 1922, we had no mass media

like today. Even then, he wrote that we live in a world that is

constructed by what others tell us--through stories, pictures and

newspaper accounts. No one has the ability to directly experience the

dramatic accounts we're told or read about, so we must experience them

second-hand, through the prism of others' interpretation.

<p>Today's mass media, and individual journalists and reporters, are our

prism for the most part. They have an enormous responsibility to tell

stories that reflect the reality, and not just the pseudo-reality, of

places. Without these stories, our city of Los Angeles will remain

divided between neighborhoods and communities deserving of our time and

money and those that are not.
