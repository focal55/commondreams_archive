As 2001 lurches to a close, Americans are edgy. And who can blame them? The Sept. 

11 terrorist attacks led to the Afghanistan war. Then came corporate bailouts 

and job cutbacks, anthrax spores, military-police build-ups, civil rights rollbacks 

and government censors. The corporate news media has reported these events but 

failed to clearly connect them to the current rot in the capitalist system. Thus 

the American public is being deprived of a socio-economic context for recent events. 

<p>The past is in the present. Consider one of the system’s previous responses 

to crises. In a word, fascism. Historically, fascism has emerged in a time of 

economic turbulence, featuring one political party of big business that relies 

partly on symbols and themes of national unity to mobilize the public. 

<p>Today there are surely signs of economic trouble that could encourage fascist-like 

responses. The American economy is the world’s largest and is now leading the 

world slowdown. The stock market bubble that helped drive the record U.S. economic 

expansion of the past decade is a shadow of its former self. Unemployment is increasing 

for American workers as corporate profits move south. U.S. consumer and corporate 

debt is unsustainable. 

<p>Prospects for global growth look bleak. “Recent figures from the WTO show that 

world trade will barely grow this year, if at all,” the Nov. 16 London Economist 

reported. Nations that rely on exports to America are being especially hard-hit. 

Gulliver sneezes and Lilliput gets sick. 

<p>Returning to historical fascism, Germany in 1933 isn't the U.S. today. Yet 

there are similarities. In Germany, fascism claimed to support workers but actually 

neutered them. In "Fascism and Big Business," Daniel Guerin detailed how Germany's 

National Socialism attacked and defeated unions. 

<p>Supported by Republicans and Democrats, the corporate-led war against organized 

labor is one reason the U.S. is simply off the charts when it comes to social 

indicators versus other First World nations. Here are two examples. Over 40 million 

Americans lack health care and two million Americans are locked up. 

<p>Fascism has arisen when a country’s ownership class resorts to military solutions 

when its profits are threatened by market competition. Guerin wrote, “There is, 

certainly, a direct link between war and fascism. They grow out of the same dungheap; 

they are, each in its own way, the monstrous products of the capitalist system 

in decline.” 

<p>During the fascist era, world trade basically ground to a halt. National economies 

spiraled downward during brutal competition for resources in what’s now called 

the Third World. The main global resource today, of course, is oil, the essential 

energy for the system, playing no small part of the war in Afghanistan. U.S. control 

of Middle East oil weakens Europe and Japan. They are the main competition for 

the U.S. 

<p>During the period that preceded World War II, global market competition led 

to worsening living conditions for the German and Italian working classes. Big 

businesses in those nations protected their profits by relying on a strong central 

government to support social movements which sounded egalitarian. In Germany and 

Italy, the moneyed few forced the working many to labor longer hours for less 

pay, then wage war to protect that wealth and the power it controlled. 

<p>Before Sept. 11 in the U.S., the drive to create low-wage work was well underway. 

Corporate America—through think tanks such as the American Enterprise Institute—supported 

the 1996 Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act. Welfare “reform” in 

other words. Now that some former welfare recipients have jobs, the same corporate-funded 

institutions oppose a “living” wage, preferring some workers to sleep in their 

cars and use food banks to make ends meet. Confusing? Not to those who choose 

to see that the system is based on the growth of capital through the exploitation 

of labor. 

<p>To keep the public fearful since Sept. 11, U.S. politicians and pundits have 

been supporting an inquisition of sorts against darker people deemed to be dangerous. 

This came on the heels of government repression against the anti-corporate globalization 

protesters who publicly criticized the system’s major institutions such as the 

WTO and IMF. Creating a climate of fear in the name of security is a cloud cover 

to eliminate popular dissent. 

<p>On a related note, the U.S. government is protecting the profits of corporate 

America with taxpayer dollars. Some politicians call this “economic stimulus,” 

though the public’s economic security is becoming shakier. The taxpayer bailout 

of U.S. airlines that got billions then fired over 100,000 workers is a case in 

point of how the U.S. corporate-state functions, putting profits before people. 

<p>The airline bailout was a current example of a decades-long class conflict 

in the U.S. The American public has been abandoned by the Democratic Party for 

the nation’s financial and industrial elite. Their swollen wealth has come in 

part from the hides of the U.S. working-class. 

<p>A friend who lived through the fascist coup in Chile on Sept. 11, 1973, said 

America would get fascism before it got socialism. Some might say that U.S. socialism 

already exists—for the corporate and high-income class, fattened by years of public 

funds for research, development, patent and copyright protection. 

<p>Since Sept. 11, 2001, the U.S. government has increased its power over the 

public, which is funding the war in Afghanistan that feeds cash to sectors of 

corporate America. The U.S. population pays and big business benefits. Ben Franklin 

summed it up nicely. He wrote, “War is robbery, commerce is generally cheating.”
