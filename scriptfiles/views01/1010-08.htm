I am one  of many deeply conflicted ex-activists who worked to stop the war 

on Vietnam but isn’t (at least as of October 10) quite sure how to act in the 

current situation.



<p>Let’s get the bona fides out of the way first. In the ‘60s and early-’70s, I 

was involved majorly in the anti-war movement, everything from Movement 

journalism, to  organizing and addressing rallies and demos, to running draft 

dodgers across the border into Canada. I  was threatened with arrest more 

than once, and I lost my college-teaching job because of my perceived 

“radicalism.”



<p>But that was another time, another war. It was clear from the git-go that the 

war in Vietnam was immoral and  doomed to failure in any case. (Even 

Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara admits that he knew as early as 1967 

that the war was unwinnable.) The U.S. government was ignorant of Vietnamese 

history and culture, and was fighting a technological war for a long time 

against an invisible enemy of determined guerrillas fighting to expel the 

invaders. Le plus ca change... 



<p>Everything changed on September 11, 2001. The U.S. mainland itself was under 

attack from determined, clever,  ideologically resolute guerrillas, eager and 

willing to die in their religious/political frenzy. Regardless of  what one 

thinks of their political and policy complaints -- and regardless of what one 

thinks of U.S. foreign policy over the decades that might have contributed to 

the climate that breeds terror -- their crime against humanity and their 

single-minded determination to kill  U.S. civilians wherever and however they 

can puts them beyond any pale of civilized  behavior. These are very bad and 

dangerous people. They must be rooted out and dealt with.



<p>So I applaud President Bush’s pushing the issue of terrorism to the top of 

the world’s agenda, and organizing a coalition to begin attacking the terror 

networks in a wide variety of ways: diplomatically  (isolating  states that  

may have harbored terrorists), financially (trying to dry up their 

money-laundering accounts), through police work here and abroad (rounding up 

suspects, collapsing cells planning further attacks), waging an 

educational/propaganda campaign to drum up  moral support  for the 

anti-terrorism campaign.



<p>Where I, and perhaps many like me, grow more uneasy was with the U.S. rush to 

military action. I understand the desire  to strike back relatively quickly 

-- to throw the terrorists and their supporters into a disruption of normal 

patterns, to debilitate their assets, to assuage the U.S. population’s desire 

for retaliation, etc.  -- but I question the thinking behind that approach. 

(After all, it was President Bush from the very beginning who urged patience 

and said the campaign would take years; why the rush to the military option 

FIRST?  One can never put the toothpaste back in the tube.) And I wonder if 

the U.S. action, though it may yield short-term dividends, will  come back to 

bite us badly in the long term.



<p>For one thing, not only do we not have an exit strategy for this  war, it 

appears we didn’t even have an entry strategy. We bomb for three or  four 

days and then, say U.S. spokesmen, we’ll see what happens. In other words, 

other than bombing and putting ground troops in with no clear goals, it 

doesn’t seem as if we have much of a long-term strategy.  We want to find  

and capture (or kill) the elusive bin Laden and his lieutenants, and we’d be 

happy if the Northern Alliance forces would topple the Taliban, but clearly 

we have nothing yet that is respectable and institutionally viable with which 

to replace the Taliban. And there’s no indication that we’re prepared for 

nation-building tasks in a post-Taliban Afghanistan. Instead, there are 

rumbles in the Bush administration about moving on to bombing Iraq and going 

after Saddam Hussein and his lieutenants.



<p>We are leading a most fragile coalition that  is ready to break apart at any 

moment.  If  civilian casualties in Afghanistan begin growing, and especially 

if we attack another Muslim country, the coalition will implode, with 

potentially horrendous consequences. Bin Laden and his friends and supporters 

around the Middle East/South Asia will have fodder for their fire that this 

whole U.S.-led operation is another “crusade” (Bush’s original term, 

remember) against Islam.  (Remember the Italian prime minister’s racist 

remarks about Islam and how Christianity is far superior? No wonder Muslims 

are nervous.)



<p>Pakistan’s leadership may be overthrown, and has anybody emphasized that 

Pakistan now has nuclear weapons? Do we want to contemplate what bin Laden 

and the Taliban and their  allies might do with such nuclear missiles? 

Indonesia, the most populous Muslim state in the world, already politically 

shaky, could fall to fundamentalist extremists.



<p>Meanwhile, off  the geopolitical radar screen, what is China up to? While the 

U.S. is preoccupied with going after terrorists (and there are reports that  

China is moving   Chinese-Muslim troops near, or maybe even into Afghanistan, 

perhaps to aid the Taliban),  might China decide to engage in  some major 

mischief of its own? (Even more disturbing possibility: In exchange for its 

anti-terrorism support, the U.S.  seems to have given  Russia carte blanche  

to do what it wants in Chechnya; might we have made a similiar, 

under-the-table deal with China in regard to Taiwan?)



<p>Finally,  the U.S. -- from top governmental officials to ordinary American 

citizens -- seem utterly focused  on the terrorists we know, with virtually 

no attention being paid to the next generation of terrorists we don’t now 

know. In other words, we are forgetting to pay attention to finding a way to 

lower tensions in the Middle East. We know, if we think about it, that U.S. 

foreign/military policy has contributed to the growth of anti-U.S. sentiment 

in that explosive area of the world, even among  Arabs and other Muslims who 

consider the terror attacks on the U.S. a major crime of horror.  Should we 

not be  thinking, even a little bit, about  re-examining U.S. foreign 

policies that  bring risk to our country?



<p>It seems to me that  this would make sense, but we’re in the usual American 

mode of trying to remove the irritant to our system and then getting “back to 

normal.” If we go that route, we will have to deal not only with the 

dangerous terrorists from The Base but with a whole new crop just  waiting to 

join the Islamic extremists’ “jihad” against the U.S. and Western 

civilization in general. There is no “going back to normal”; we’d better get 

used to  it: This IS normal for the foreseeable future. Bin Laden's network 

is  so extremist/fundamentalist in its attitude that even if there were a 

just Israeli/Palestinian peace, he'd still be on his jihad against the U.S.; 

they've got to be stopped.



<p>What am I referring to in terms of what the U.S. can do? Well, for starters, 

how about the U.S. becoming energizingly engaged in trying to broker a peace 

between Israel and the Palestinians -- one that takes into account Israel’s 

desire for security and the Palestinians’ need for a contiguous  state? How 

about  re-thinking whether there’s another alternative to basing our troops 

in Saudi Arabia? How about weaning our economy and culture off Mideast oil 

(and I don’t mean opening up ANWAR in order that we can continue to drive 

gas-guzzling SUVs)? Etc. Etc.



<p>In sum, if we truly want to move intelligently beyond this current war effort 

-- assuming we can get through it without the Law of Unintended Consequences 

(Pakistan & nuclear weapons, China’s machinations, India& Pakistan going to 

war,   something else unforeseen) bringing havoc to the world  -- we’ve got 

as citizens to become better educated as to history, geopolitics, and learn 

how everything ties together. And then let our  political leaders know that 

we know.



<p>So, having said all that, what are we conflicted ex-activists to do, given 

that we support the idea of closing up terrorist cells around the world, but 

are anxious, and have many questions,  about  U.S. war policies? 



<p>I can’t speak for others, but for me, I will continue  raising these 

questions wherever I can -- to my senators and Congresspeople, in public 

dialogue in newspapers and on the internet, I will try to remind folks that 

once the war genie is let out of the bottle the Law of Unintended 

Consequences can lead to disasters, I will emphasize the need to re-examine 

American foreign policy in the Mideast and elsewhere that may be creating the 

conditions that lead to hatred and resentment of  America and Americans. And 

I will pray, and work, for  justice and eventual peace.
