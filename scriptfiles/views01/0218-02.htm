UNIVERSITY OF San Francisco student Sara Suman came because her high 

school religion teacher once "presented me with something I couldn't ignore."

<P>  Andrea Pereira of Lick-Wilmerding High came to support the jailed human 

rights activist Charlie Liteky. And, like the other 500 students who gathered 

Tuesday on the USF campus, Alistair Rogers of Serra High came because "I 

wanted to see Father Roy speak live and in person."

</P>

<P>  Father Roy is the Rev. Roy Bourgeois, a Catholic priest who staged his 

first protest in 1990 against the School of the Americas at Fort Benning, Ga. 

Last month, the school changed its name to the Western Hemisphere Institute 

for Security Operations, but Bourgeois is still its Public Enemy No. 1.

</P>

<P>  "Changing the name is like taking a bottle of poison and simply writing 

'penicillin' on it," he said. "They tell us they're teaching democracy there 

now. How is this possible through the barrel of a gun in an undemocratic 

institution?"

</P>

<P>  School of the Americas was established by the U.S. Army in Panama in 1946 

to train Latin American soldiers for "instability" in their own nations. In 

1984, it moved to Fort Benning.

</P>

<P>  Through the Freedom of Information Act and reports by the United Nations 

Truth Commission, Bourgeois and other foes of the school discovered a 

veritable Hall of Shame among its thousands of alumni. Former Panamanian 

strongman Manuel Noriega and the leader of the El Salvador death squads, 

Roberto D'Aubuisson, are just two.

</P>

<P>  Officials at the school insist all of that -- the courses in commando 

training and psychological warfare -- is history. They say the facility has 

shifted focus, and efforts to end its $20 million in annual funding are 

misplaced. Bourgeois says otherwise.

</P>

<P>  "We're taking seriously what they say they're teaching: democracy and human 

rights," he said. "But why did I get a letter from the wife of one of the 

soldiers, asking for our newsletter but telling me not to send it to the 

school because they aren't allowed to read such material?

</P>

<P>  "This is still an Army base. They know and we know that if they strip that 

school of its essence, its combat courses, if they really teach about land 

reform, agronomy, human rights, the soldiers would not come."

</P>

<P>  Since his first protest, when a handful of kindred souls joined Bourgeois 

at the front gate of Fort Benning, the crowd has grown. Last November, some 9,

000 people showed up; 3,500 chose to peacefully trespass onto the base; 1,700 

were arrested.

</P>

<P>  Bourgeois, 62, has spent nearly four years in various federal prisons for 

his School of the Americas protests. Among a core group of 50 fellow 

protesters, including Vietnam War hero Charlie Liteky, 30 years of prison time 

have been served.

</P>

<P>  Liteky, a U.S. Medal of Honor winner who lives in San Francisco, is in the 

middle of a one-year sentence in Lompoc prison for two misdemeanor counts of 

trespassing. Last week, he turned 70. His wife, Judy, stood in for him at two 

USF events, including the one for students.

</P>

<P>  "The number and the cross-section of kids -- from public, private and 

Catholic schools, and from eighth grade through college -- overwhelmed me with 

joy and the sense of possibility," said Judy Liteky. "Charlie will be very 

touched to hear that his name is known among them."

</P>

<P>  One of those knowing students is Connor Schmeding, a junior from Jesuit 

High in Sacramento. He and his classmates made the trip to USF with their 

Christian Service Director, Joanne Castronovo. Only 17, Schmeding is a veteran 

of nonviolent protest.

</P>

<P>  "In theology class, I learned the difference between works of mercy, which 

is like charity, and social action, which is more reform, like the movement to 

close the SOA," he said.

</P>

<P>  "I choose to be an activist. My goal in life is not to have a nice car and 

a lot of money; it's to help people. I want to do what (assassinated 

Salvadoran) Bishop Oscar Romero said: I want to be a voice for the voiceless."
