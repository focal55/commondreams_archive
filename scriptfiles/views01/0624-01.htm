AMAGANSETT, N.Y.<wbr>--<wbr>Not so long ago, it seemed simple. Americans were engaged in a

continuing historical enterprise: to tame the land, to establish a

democratic society, to industrialize, later to demonstrate that people of

different origins can live and work together, and later still to save the

world from tyranny. We were bound by the belief that we had a common

interest, toward which we would work and for which we would sacrifice.

Throughout the nation's history, fierce debates have raged over what the

national interest was, notably during the Civil War, but one would have

been hard put to find Americans who denied its existence ....until now.

<p>No administration in recent memory has invoked "national interest" as

reverently and repeatedly as that of President George W. Bush. Policy

decisions, we are told, are determined by our national interest. Signing

the Kyoto Protocol on global warming? Not in our national interest.

Keeping U.S. peacekeepers in the Balkans? Not in our national interest.

Adhering to the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile  Treaty? Probably no longer

in our national interest.

<p>But as much as "national interest" has become the administration's

mantra in dealing with the world, seldom has the idea of a national

interest seemed so attenuated at home. Throughout the culture, one can

already detect the symptoms of altruism deprivation.

<p>The idea of a national interest was predicated on a simple assumption:

The whole of the nation was greater than the sum of its parts, and there

were some communal aims that trumped individual interests. America was

not just a collection of interests; it had an interest of its own.

<p>Although national interest has become a political cliche, it is more

than just high-blown patriotic rhetoric. For the last 20 years, no

question may have been more significant than the question of what

constitutes the national interest, and no issue may have been more

central in framing our political debates. The Republican ascendancy in

the 1980s was fueled primarily by the GOP's criticism that Democrats had

become a party of special interests--constituencies they had to satisfy

like so many bawling children. Implicit in this criticism was that the

Democratic Party, in hostage to minorities, unions and women and using

government to broker their needs, had lost sight of the larger national

interest. By confusing a grab bag of interests with a national interest,

the Democrats effectively left us without one.

<p>Ronald Reagan's electoral success may be attributed not only to his

ability to persuade Americans that Democrats were no longer capable of

serving the national interest but also in convincing voters that there

was a clearly defined set of national interests, the pursuit of which

would benefit everyone--namely, fighting communism and promoting free

enterprise. The bedrock of Reaganism was that government had been

corrupted by operating as if it were delivering largesse to clients--that

is, operating as if there were just factional interests--when what it

should have been doing is, first, getting out of people's way so that the

economy could surge forward and, second, funneling more money to the

military so that we could put some muscle behind our threats to our

enemies. Both of these were  purported to be for the greater good.

<p>But there was in Reagan's formulation a poison pill that has come to

haunt us now that even Democrats espouse an attitude of laissez faire

when it comes to the economy and now that there is no longer a communist

threat to build a military against. Since Reagan's presidency, one can

detect that dismantling government in the name of empowering individuals

didn't create a new national interest. It just turned individual

interests into the national interest, so that instead of various groups

making demands, every individual is making demands. Where once President

Dwight D. Eisenhower's secretary of defense, Charles E. Wilson, claimed

that what was good for General Motors was good for the country, now

Republicans claim that each individual's pursuit of his own interest is

good for the country. Thus was Carl Sandburg's thumbnail analysis of the

Civil War--those who believed the "United States is" against those who

believed the "United States are"--turned into political philosophy: the

"national interest is" versus the "national interests are."

<p>One may characterize the differences between our major parties in many

ways. For example, one protects business from the people, the other

protects the people from business. But the fundamental difference over

the last 20 years may well be this: In a kind of Adam Smith version of

politics, the GOP believes that the aggregate of individual interests is

the national interest; the Democratic Party does not.

<p>Nowhere is this more evident than in the current Bush administration.

When asked recently on "The O'Reilly Factor" what he considered the most

important mission of his administration, the president quickly answered

"tax relief." Then, apparently realizing how feeble this sounded, he

quickly began stammering about education. But Bush's first response was

the genuine one. There is no national interest anymore--save maybe

protecting the U.S. from North Korean missiles--other than providing

people with more money so they can better pursue their own interests. To

believe in a national interest, one must believe in sacrifice, in

forgoing one's immediate gratification. But the president and his

supporters don't believe in forgoing individual needs; they believe in

indulging them, on the theory that gratification is what keeps the

economic pump-primed, which may make Bush, not former President Bill

Clinton, the real president of the pampered baby-boomers.

<p>Although no one wants to refuse a tax cut when it is offered, U.S.

politicians, in any case, don't debate the stark choices between public

services and tax cuts that were the focus of Britain's recent elections.

Instead, we debate whether we are going to pay down the debt or get tax

relief. But Americans, nevertheless, do sense that something is missing

from their national life; they seem nostalgic for a time when there was

some larger purpose than accruing more money, some interest larger than

their own. This may be a factor in the president's falling popularity. He

calls us to no higher cause.

<p>It may also help explain the current obsession with the "Greatest

Generation" that fought World War II. While Bush is bragging about a $600

tax rebate, here was a generation that managed to save the world from

Nazism and resurrect the European economy after the war while steering

its own economy to then-unprecedented wealth. What they demonstrated was

the power of a national interest. Similarly, the popularity of the film

"Pearl Harbor," despite Disney's disappointment in its box-office

numbers, is certainly a tribute to the last time that the entire nation

was galvanized in common cause and with a clear sense of the national

interest. In its romantic melodrama, what the film shows, inadvertently

or not, is that there are times when personal gratification (love) must

yield to the national interest (repelling the enemy).

<p>An even more interesting example of nostalgia for a national interest,

however, is the recent rehabilitation of the reputation of John Adams,

with a laudatory essay in Joseph Ellis' "Founding Brothers" and the new

best-selling biography of Adams by David McCullough. (Although Ellis'

truthfulness in the classroom is under fire, his scholarship has not been

challenged.) For generations, Adams was disparaged as a pallid hack when

compared with his antagonist Thomas Jefferson. As historians have

presented him, Adams was short and fat, garrulous, both hotheaded and

temporizing, an elitist with quasi-monarchist tendencies and a loyal

toady to George Washington. Jefferson, on the other hand, was tall and

sleek, enigmatic, a man of principle, a democrat and an iconoclast who

marched to his own drummer. Or as Jefferson himself put it, the

difference between them was between the many and the few, the people and

the aristocrats.

<p>But Ellis and McCullough reveal another, more critical difference that

particularly resonates today. Whatever else he did or was, Adams believed

fervently in a national interest and was even willing to sacrifice his

career in its name. In Ellis' words, Adams felt the "duty of an American

statesman was to divine the public interest while studiously ignoring,

indeed remaining blissfully oblivious to, the partisan pleadings of

particular constituencies." On the other hand, Jefferson, who paid a

great deal of attention to particular constituencies, felt that the

national government had no interest other than the several interests of

its people and its states. If anything, he was afraid of what the

promotion of a national interest might do to individual rights.

<p>Presidents go in and out of historical fashion as the contemporary

political climate changes, and Jefferson's vogue definitely seems to be

waning even as Bush pursues a Jeffersonian agenda. Now, at a time when

the best our political leadership can offer is paltry tax cuts in lieu of

attacking the country's problems, McCullough and Ellis are extolling

Adams, an 18th-century man who, among his qualities of probity and

diplomacy, understood that to be a nation a people must have a sense of

something other than their own self-interest. It is a message the current

president might well heed, for without it, as Adams well recognized, we

are not citizens, only consumers.
