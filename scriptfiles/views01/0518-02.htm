When I received a flurry of death threats in the past few weeks in

response to my stance advocating an end to Israel's occupation of the

West Bank, I remembered a lesson we had learned in the 1960s: If your

people are involved in brutality on the outside, the cruelty and hatred

is certain to reverberate on the inside of your community as well.

<p>"You subhuman leftist animals should all be exterminated" ran one

threat that was titled "Die Die." Another began, "Someone will come to

kill you--you should rot in hell." Well, this is par for the course when

you are critiquing Israeli policy, but what changed my attitude was when

a Web site went up last week that identified me as one of the three major

self-hating American Jews (others were linguist Noam Chomsky and director

Woody Allen), went on to call me a "traitor" to the Jewish people and

then published my home address plus the driving instructions on how to

get there. At that point, the Anti-Defamation League called the FBI.

<p>The climate of hostility toward dissenters in the Jewish world has

risen to new levels of verbal abuse. Tikkun is the only nationally

distributed Jewish magazine to challenge the assumptions of the

occupation, to urge dismantling of the settlements in the West Bank and

to insist that Israel must acknowledge some (not total) responsibility

for Palestinian refugees. Just as we in the anti-Vietnam War movement of

the 1960s saw our opposition as flowing from the highest values of

American democracy, so we in the Jewish peace movement insist that it is

Jewish values that lead us to insist that every human being is created in

the image of God and that the brutality done to the Palestinian people is

as much a tragedy as the brutality being done by Palestinian terrorists

to Israelis.

<p>It is this kind of moral equivalence that infuriates some Jews, who

insist that "no suffering is like our suffering" and that past suffering

warrants present insensitivity to the Palestinian people. Many Jews are

unwilling to acknowledge that Israel is the only side in this struggle

that has an army, that Palestinians have had 10 times as many deaths as

Israelis and that this time it is the Palestinians who are closed in to

small areas and prevented from getting food, education and medical care.

It seems so much easier to blame the victims and become furious at the

messengers who are raising serious moral objections to Israeli behavior.

<p>And the same dehumanization used against Palestinians now begins to

emerge against peace-oriented Jews. Never mind that my son served in the

Israeli army, that I am a strong supporter of Israel or that I lead a

Jewish renewal synagogue in San Francisco. For these right-wing

extremists, I am nothing but "a self-hating Jew."

<p>In the months before Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin was

assassinated, there were similar charges against him. In Israel it is now

against the law to make that kind of charge, because people have come to

realize how easy it is for hateful language to become violent action. But

even when it doesn't go to violence, this kind of language scares many

people and makes them feel reluctant to speak out. Our magazine has lost

subscribers and donors as people feel scared to identify with an

outspoken voice on these questions.

<p>When people ask me what to do in response to all this, I have two

answers: First, the best way to fight hate is to put out more love into

the world. Even the haters are people who are severely wounded, and those

wounds can best be dealt with by compassion rather than by hating back.

Second, speak out yourself on these questions. Many non-Jews have feared

expressing legitimate criticisms of Israel, thinking that they would be

interpreted as anti-Semitism. Last week visiting Syria, the pope stood

silently when President Bashar Assad uttered standard anti-Semitic

tropes. Only a Christian world that aggressively challenges all remnants

of anti-Semitism can have the legitimacy to critique Israel. What the

Jewish people need is for Christians to denounce anti-Semitism, but

nevertheless to join with progressive Jews in criticizing immoral and

self-destructive policies of the Israeli government.

<p>In the past, I have called for Palestinians to renounce violence and

follow the path of Martin Luther King Jr and Gandhi. It's time to ask the

same of Jews--not only toward the Palestinians, but toward their fellow

Jews as well.
