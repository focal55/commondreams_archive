<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->I sat in the summer sun a few months ago with Blake Lee Harwood from Greenpeace, idly discussing whether Bush had inadvertently done environmentalists a favor. Kyboshing the Kyoto accord meant people who had never heard of climate change were suddenly discussing carbon trading and greenhouse gases. 

<P>In Britain, there were hopeful signs. Tony Blair was promising to go to Johannesburg for next year's earth summit and making speeches about putting environment at the government's heart. Even his technofix vision was better than nothing. Stephen Byers was unexpectedly promising and seemed to be insisting on proper public funding for transport. The foot and mouth disaster presented an opportunity to push for more sustainable use of the countryside. Environmentalists were rolling up their sleeves for a big push.  <P>That was then and this is now. After September 11, all other political agendas have been shoved aside. It's frustrating for anyone in domestic politics, galling to see lavish spending on military activity when the relatively modest amounts we sought for domestic improvements had been refused.  <P>For environmentalists, the current situation is disturbing. Blair has been using environmental rhetoric to justify the global alliance with Bush. At the Labour conference, he said the war's silver lining would be a new world order of binding multilateral agreements on things such as climate change; the unspoken agenda was that America would toe the line.  <P>We have to take him at his word. Bush has said no such   thing. According to him, the war's explicit goals are freedom, democracy, justice. Indeed, the war's implicit goals look radically at odds with environmental objectives. Mayor Giuliani implied that defending the American way of life was the war's true ethic. The victims in the twin towers, he said, were innocent people pursuing the American dream. The world must defend their right to it.  <P>From the point of view of the planet's future, though, that dream is hardly defensible: a gas-guzzling, unsustainable culture, consuming more than its share of global resources. Bush's departure from Kyoto said it all. American wealth takes precedence over the planet. Perhaps the planet would stand a better chance in the hands of the Taliban, were it not for the increasing Afghan population.  <P>Sadly, the clock can't be   turned back. Some of us may even support decisive action against fundamentalist terrorism. But that doesn't mean keeping quiet. More than any group, environmentalists warned about America's devil-may-care attitude towards the planet and its ruthless promotion of American interests under the guise of global free trade. It was environmentalists, too, who insisted that while global political agreements could be good, current global trade agreements were damaging.  <P> Leaving aside actual damage to local habitats and communities, the transport involved in this global trade consumes one-eighth of world oil production, with serious implications for climate. If Blair is going to use environmental rhetoric he's going to have to cut a deal.   He can have our support if we get the society we want.  <P>Now is the moment to challenge and make demands rather than keep quiet. This war has woken the whole world up to the issues at the heart of environmental campaigning; in particular the injustice and instability of free trade agreements and the foolish over-dependence on fossil-based fuel. A crypto-war could affect relations with Middle Eastern oil producers for our lifetimes. So it makes sense on every level to reduce oil dependency,   instead investing properly in renewables. The UK still lags behind other Europeans in terms of grants to individuals and companies to invest in renewables. Most companies still charge the consumer more to "choose" green electricity, and this is inexcusable either in terms of climate or national security.  <P>Now is also the right time to discuss the role of nuclear power in future energy policies. The energy review is in progress and, headed by the pro-nuclear Brian Wilson, there are signs nuclear energy may be pushed as a "green" alternative to fossil fuels. Yet the all too real risks of accident and terrorism mean this should be robustly challenged. The same vigilance must be applied to food and agriculture.  <P>The horror of the twin towers supplanted images of burning cattle but we should   not forget them. The big farmers refused to vaccinate because of their export market. As it turned out, the severity of the infection destroyed that anyway. In the meantime, more valuable rural industries were brought to their knees. It was a lesson we didn't need again: the global food market is a disaster for the environment, health, animal welfare and the small producers.  <P>For all its fine words, the government's performance on the environment has been half-hearted. Now that has to change. In an unstable world, we need sustainable local production along with global agreements in order to secure peace. The last thing we need to do is give uncritical support to a nation which thinks it is its right to consume, come what may.</p>
