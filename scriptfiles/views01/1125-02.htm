BERKELEY -- Rituals of patriotism have made quite a comeback in the last couple 

of months. The New York City Board of Education unanimously passed a resolution 

last month to require all public schools to lead a daily Pledge of Allegiance 

each morning and at all school events. "It's a small way to thank the heroes of 

9/11," explained the board's president. In Orange County, Celebration USA Inc., 

a nonprofit patriotic organization, synchronized a nationwide recitation of the 

pledge at 2 p.m. Eastern time on Oct. 12. Several states are considering the adoption 

of laws that would require the pledge in all public schools, and Nebraska has 

dusted off a 1949 state law requiring schools to devise curricula aimed at instilling 

a "love of liberty, justice, democracy and America ... in the hearts and minds 

of the youth."

<p>In the aftermath of Sept. 11, people are hungry for social rituals and eager 

to communicate a deeper sense of national belonging. But this new rash of prescribing 

and orchestrating patriotism is not the answer.

<p>Rituals of patriotism were first institutionalized between the Civil War and 

World War I, when organizations such as the Grand Army of the Republic, Women's 

Relief Corps and Daughters of the American Revolution campaigned to transform 

schools, as educator George Balch put it, into a "mighty engine for the inculcation 

of patriotism." Balch, a New York City kindergarten teacher and Civil War veteran, 

held what is believed to be the first celebration of Flag Day as a way of teaching 

his mostly immigrant students about the flag. But his was not a patriotism that 

embraced pluralism. His purpose, as he described it, was to instill discipline 

and loyalty in what he called the "human scum, cast on our shores by the tidal 

wave of a vast migration." He wrote what is considered to be the first pledge 

to the flag, a clunky manifesto in which students promised to "give our heads 

and our hearts to God and our Country! One nation! One language! One flag!" In 

1890, Balch published a primer for other educators, "Methods for Teaching Patriotism 

in the Public Schools," that called for the use of devotional rites of patriotism 

modeled along the lines of a catechism. "There is nothing which more impresses 

the youthful mind and excites its emotions," noted the West Point graduate, than 

the "observance of form."

<p>To commemorate the first Columbus Day celebration in 1892, Youth's Companion 

magazine asked Francis Bellamy to write a new pledge to be recited by children 

at school. Bellamy, a Christian socialist with a commitment to social reform, 

dismissed Balch's formula as a "childish form of words invented by an ex-military 

officer." He wanted a pledge that would resonate with American history and make 

students into active participants in a "social citizenry." For Bellamy, the notion 

of "allegiance" evoked the great call for unity during the Civil War and "one 

nation, indivisible" recalled a phrase used by Abraham Lincoln. Bellamy was tempted 

to add the historic slogan of the French Revolution--"Liberty, Equality, Fraternity"--to 

the language of his pledge, but, in the end, he decided that this would be too 

much for people to accept. Instead, he settled for the final phrase "with liberty 

and justice for all." This way, he reasoned, the pledge could be ideologically 

"applicable to either an individualistic or a socialistic state," a matter for 

future generations to decide.

<p>Bellamy's words--"I pledge allegiance to my flag and to the republic for which 

it stands, one nation, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all"--were gradually 

adopted throughout the country. But the pledge, once imagined as a living principle 

of justice and liberty, quickly became suffused with militarism and obedience 

to authority. On Columbus Day 1892, according to newspaper reports, children marched 

with "drilled precision" as "one army under the sacred flag."

<p>In the wake of the Spanish-American War, state-sanctioned rituals of patriotism 

became more common. In New York, soon after war was declared in April of 1898, 

the legislature instructed the state superintendent of public instruction to prepare 

"a program providing for a salute to the flag ... at the opening of each day of 

school." Daily rituals aimed at reaching children's hearts were backed up with 

new civics curriculums to secure their minds with heroic images of virile soldiers 

and the honor of dying for one's country. A typical children's primer published 

in 1903 taught that "B stood for Battles" and Z for the zeal "that has carried 

us through/When fighting for justice/With the Red, White and Blue."

<p>During World War I, worries arose about citizens with dual allegiances, and 

some feared that Bellamy's pledge allowed cunning fifth-columnist immigrants to 

swear a secret loyalty to another country. To close this loophole, the words "my 

flag" were changed to "the flag of the United States." Many states now required 

students to salute the flag every day.

<p>In Chicago in 1916, an 11-year old African American student was arrested because 

he refused to respect what he saw as a symbol of Jim Crow and lynching. "I am 

willing to salute the flag," Hubert Eaves explained, "as the flag salutes me." 

Meanwhile, Boy Scout troops across the country staged massive operettas in celebration 

of "America First."

<p>Between the world wars, thousands of Jehovah's Witnesses were persecuted and 

their children expelled from school for refusing to salute the flag. What began 

as an attempt to encourage loyalty to a nation "with liberty and justice for all" 

devolved into the suppression of dissent and unquestioning homage to the flag.

<p>In 1943, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that an obligatory loyalty oath is unconstitutional, 

thus putting the law on the side of any student who refused to participate in 

patriotic or religious rituals. But even after the ruling, refusal to say the 

pledge took both courage and conviction.

<p>The pledge remained unchanged until Flag Day 1954, when President Eisenhower 

approved the addition of the constitutionally questionable phrase "under God" 

to differentiate this country from its godless Cold War antagonist.

<p>Since the Vietnam War and the divides of conscience it generated, educators 

have not been inclined to impose rote patriotic drills on their students. Instead, 

schools began slowly to redefine patriotism in a more inclusive way, a way that 

speaks to the needs of a multiethnic, polyglot population living in an increasingly 

globalized world. This is not the time to reverse this trend by reverting to form 

over substance and rote memorization over democratic participation.

<p>"What of our purpose as a nation?" pondered Bellamy more than a century ago 

when he crafted his pledge. Our students today can better use their time debating 

this question than marching in lock-step loyalty.
