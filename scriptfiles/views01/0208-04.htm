For his critics, Ariel Sharon's electoral victory in Israel spells defeat

for Middle Eastern peace. For his supporters, however, only a tough,

right-wing politician with military credentials can deliver a lasting deal.

<P>

   Yet whatever steps Sharon takes vis-a-vis the Palestinians, he will be

dogged by persistent allegations of past involvement in crimes of war. In a

world where notions of international justice loom increasingly large, Sharon's

record may prove acutely embarrassing for Israel.

<P>



At issue are at least three incidents in Sharon's past. The first took

place in 1953, when a force under his command raided Qibya, a West Bank

village, killing more than 60 inhabitants. A contemporaneous Time magazine

report said Sharon's soldiers shot "every man, woman and child they could

find" and then dynamited 42 houses, a school and a mosque. "The cries of the

dying," the magazine reported, "could be heard amidst the explosions."

<P>

   Sharon's autobiography acknowledges civilians were killed at Qibya, but

says they were a mistake. Given the evidentiary record, however, his

explanation seems weak.

<P>

   Under international law, Sharon could be indicted for crimes against

humanity.

<P>

   The second incident took place during Israel's 1982 thrust into Lebanon,

when Sharon was defense minister. For three months Israeli forces laid siege

to West Beirut, where Palestinian guerrillas had dug in amid civilians. At the

time, The Washington Post wrote that Sharon's army subjected the city to

"punishment so intense and indiscriminate that terror was the result."

<P>

   By Aug. 16, 1982, the International Herald Tribune wrote, Beirut had become

a city of "broken concrete, flattened apartment buildings and death," and

Israeli journalists offer evidence of Sharon's direct responsibility. Zeev

Schiff and Ehud Yaari wrote that in June 1982, Sharon told officers that

Palestinian neighborhoods in Beirut should be "utterly destroyed," even though

they contained some 85,000 civilians. "Not a single terrorist neighborhood

should be left standing," Sharon reportedly said.

<P>

   The guerrillas violated international law by sheltering in a city, but the

Geneva Conventions also ban the indiscriminate and disproportionate shelling

of populated areas.

<P>

   Fifteen years later, a war crimes tribunal indicted Bosnian Serb leaders

for a similar assault on Sarajevo, even though Bosnian Muslim soldiers were

stationed throughout the city.

<P>

   The third case--the famed massacres at Sabra and Shatila--occurred on Sept.

16-18, 1982, toward the end of the battle for Beirut. The Falangists, an

Israeli-allied Lebanese militia, were ordered by Sharon to mop up armed

resistance in Palestinian refugee camps as Israeli forces stood guard.

<P>

   Israeli reports say Falangist gunmen killed 700 to 800 civilians, but other

sources estimate 2,000 dead. The New York Times' Thomas Friedman said he saw

"groups of young men in their 20s and 30s who had been lined up against walls,

tied by their hands and feet, and then mowed down gangland-style." Women,

children and the elderly were also among those slain in the 62-hour assault.

<P>

   Although Sharon denied responsibility, an Israeli commission of inquiry

ruled in February 1983 that he bore "indirect responsibility" for the

massacres, harshly castigating him for his role. In 1985, a U.S. Military Law

Review analysis argued that Sharon had "command responsibility" for the

killings. In 1999, former Serbian leader Slobodan Milosevic was indicted by

the Yugoslav war tribunal under a similar clause for Serbia's Kosovo crimes.

<P>

   During the Cold War, men such as Sharon had little to fear from

international legal prosecution. The Geneva Conventions obliged countries to

pursue war criminals, but few countries cared.

<P>

   Recently, however, activists have dramatically changed international legal

practice. Chile's ex-president was indicted in Spain, Chad's ex-ruler was

arrested in Senegal and Congo's foreign minister was charged by Belgian

authorities. In addition, special tribunals for Yugoslavia and Rwanda have

proved increasingly able to catch, try and imprison war criminals.

<P>

   Sharon's electoral victory thus coincides with a global sea change in legal

standards. Whether Sharon really wants peace, his reputation, as well as that

of the nation that elected him, will be consistently undermined by his past.

While waging Israel's wars, Sharon has amassed a record too awful to ignore.
