The power to depict history is entangled with the power to create 

it. George Orwell observed long ago: "Who controls the past controls the 

future; who controls the present controls the past." And so it is in 2001, 

as American media outlets draw conclusions about the presidencies of Ronald 

Reagan and Bill Clinton.



         <p>For conservative pundits, the two are open-and-shut cases of 

virtue and depravity; honor and its absence. The Gipper's recent 90th 

birthday brought an outpouring of tributes from top Republican 

image-crafters and media commentators, often one and the same. Reagan is 

now "lauded and embraced not only by the country but by its opinion 

leaders, its media, its historians and elites," Peggy Noonan rejoiced.



         <p>The Wall Street Journal's editorial page was an apt place for the 

gushing from Noonan, a former Reagan speech writer, still enraptured, still 

spinning, more pleased than ever with the mega-media adulation of her hero: 

"All week in the Reagan specials they celebrated, without saying the word, 

his character. But that's what his political victories were about.... He 

swam against the tide, moved forward, made progress, and got, ultimately, 

to shore."



         <p>Liberal pundits show little interest in disputing President 

Reagan's greatness. Evidently, it's easier for columnists and editorial 

writers to forget or forgive than it is for, say, the thousands of people 

in Nicaragua or Angola whose grief was scarcely reported in the U.S. press 

during the 1980s, while the Reagan administration funneled large amounts of 

money and weaponry to "freedom fighters" who massacred their loved ones.



         <p>Now, bygones are pretty much bygones along the Potomac. A tacit 

understanding prevails: If you can't say something nice about Ronald 

Reagan, better not to say anything at all.



         <p>The present-day media verdict on Bill Clinton's legacy is a whole 

other matter -- polarized and contentious. His longtime foes are eager to 

define his presidency as eight disastrous years (mitigated by a strong 

economy). Meanwhile, lots of liberals take a completely different stand.



         <p>While acknowledging negative effects of his personal flaws and 

ethical shadiness, numerous boosters have given Clinton's presidency high 

marks. "Clinton has been a very effective president," CNN's liberal Bill 

Press wrote in mid-January with typical homage. "He can leave office 

proudly, having led the United States into the 21st century."



         <p>Farther leftward, some have also jumped at the chance to sum up 

the Clinton record in glowing terms. "Clinton's historical reputation will 

more than surmount the petty complaints of contemporary critics and leave 

him remembered as one of the hardest working, most competent, fundamentally 

decent and smartest men to ever serve in the office," syndicated columnist 

Robert Scheer concluded. "He was an excellent president."



         <p>To share in such a sweeping judgment requires us to downgrade the 

importance of certain subjects -- and certain people. For instance: As he 

led the charge for the "war on drugs," President Clinton was instrumental 

in filling the nation's prisons with more and more Americans -- most of 

them poor and dark-skinned -- to the point that 2 million are now behind 

bars. Just how important is that reality? If a president did so much to 

bring it about, how excellent could he have been?



         <p>Six months ago, on the opening night of the Democratic National 

Convention in Los Angeles, bright colored signs flashed all through the 

amphitheater, operating as enormous cue-cards for the assembled loyal 

delegates -- "Thank you Bill" -- while they dutifully chanted for maximum 

media impact. Such orchestration is a task of political advance teams. 

Journalists, hopefully, have different sorts of work to do.



         <p>In spite of their better insights, year after year, many liberal 

pundits functioned as de facto apologists for Clintonism, with the implicit 

rationale that his right-wing enemies were much worse. In the process, the 

main priority often seemed to be shilling more than truth-telling. But 

journalists -- whether reporters, news analysts or commentators -- should 

serve different purposes than partisan spinmeisters.



         <p>Assessments of the Clinton presidency are not only relevant to the 

past. At Clinton's insistence, his big-money pal Terry McAuliffe is 

enthroned as the chair of the Democratic National Committee. The people in 

charge of the party seem determined to keep pace with the Republicans in 

saturating their endeavors with corporate loot. If the overall politics and 

policies of the Clinton presidency were A-OK, then there's a lot more where 

that came from.
