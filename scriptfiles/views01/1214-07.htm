The P.U.-litzer Prizes were established a decade ago to give recognition to the

stinkiest media performances of the year.



<p>As each winter arrives, I confer with Jeff Cohen of the media watch group FAIR to

sift through the large volume of entries. This year, the competition was especially

fierce. We regret that only a few journalists can win a P.U.-litzer.



<p>And now, the tenth annual P.U.-litzer Prizes, for the foulest media performances of

2001:



<p>"LOVE A MAN IN A UNIFORM" AWARD -- Cokie Roberts of ABC News "This Week"



<p>On David Letterman's show in October, Roberts gushed: "I am, I will just confess to

you, a total sucker for the guys who stand up with all the ribbons on and stuff, and they

say it's true and I'm ready to believe it. We had General Shelton on the show the last day

he was chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and I couldn't lift that jacket with all the

ribbons and medals. And so when they say stuff, I tend to believe it."



<p>PROTECTING VIEWERS FROM THE NEWS PRIZE -- CNN Chair Walter Isaacson



<p>"It seems perverse to focus too much on the casualties or hardship in Afghanistan,"

said Isaacson, in a memo ordering his staff to accompany any images of Afghan civilian

suffering with rhetoric that U.S. bombing is retaliation for the Taliban harboring

terrorists. As if the American public may be too feeble-minded to remember Sept. 11, the

CNN chief explained: "You want to make sure that when they see civilian suffering there,

it's in the context of a terrorist attack that caused enormous suffering in the United

States."



<p>PROTECTING READERS FROM THE NEWS PRIZE -- Panama City News Herald



<p>An October internal memo from the daily in Panama City, Florida, warned its editors:

"DO NOT USE photos on Page 1A showing civilian casualties from the U.S. war on

Afghanistan. Our sister paper ... has done so and received hundreds and hundreds of

threatening e-mails... DO NOT USE wire stories which lead with civilian casualties from

the U.S. war on Afghanistan. They should be mentioned further down in the story. If the

story needs rewriting to play down the civilian casualties, DO IT."



<p>BEST EMBRACE OF TERRORIST MINDSET AWARD -- columnist Ann Coulter



<p>This category had many candidates -- pundits apparently trying to sound as fanatical

as the terrorists they were denouncing -- but it was won by Coulter, who wrote in

September: "We know who the homicidal maniacs are. They are the ones cheering and dancing

right now. We should invade their countries, kill their leaders and convert them to

Christianity."



<p>Runner-up: Thomas Woodrow and The Washington Times, for a column headlined "Time to

Use the Nuclear Option," which asserted: "At a bare minimum, tactical nuclear capabilities

should be used against the bin Laden camps in the desert of Afghanistan. To do less would

be rightly seen by the poisoned minds that orchestrated these attacks as cowardice."



<p>TORTUOUS PUNDITRY PRIZE -- Jonathan Alter of Newsweek



<p>In the Nov. 5 edition, under the headline "Time to Think About Torture," Newsweek's

Alter wrote: "In this autumn of anger, even a liberal can find his thoughts turning to ...

torture. OK, not cattle prods or rubber hoses, at least not here in the United States, but

something to jump-start the stalled investigation of the greatest crime in American

history.... Some people still argue that we needn't rethink any of our old assumptions

about law enforcement, but they're hopelessly 'Sept. 10' -- living in a country that no

longer exists."



<p>CHILD WARNOGRAPHY AWARD -- Bob Edwards, NPR News



<p>On a Nov. 26 broadcast, the longtime anchor of "Morning Edition" interviewed a

12-year-old boy about a new line of trading cards marketed "to teach children about the

war on terrorism" by "featuring photographs and information about the war effort." The

elder male was enthusiastic as he compared cards. "I've got an Air Force F-16," Edwards

said. "The picture's taken from the bottom so you can see the whole payload there, all the

bombs lined up." After the boy replied with a bland "yeah," Edwards went on: "That's

pretty cool."



<p>"WILD ABOUT THAT MADMAN" AWARD -- Thomas Friedman of The New York Times



<p>"I was a critic of Rumsfeld before, but there's one thing ... that I do like about

Rumsfeld," columnist Friedman declared on Oct. 13 during a CNBC appearance. "He's just a

little bit crazy, OK? He's just a little bit crazy, and in this kind of war, they always

count on being able to out-crazy us, and I'm glad we got some guy on our bench that our

quarterback -- who's just a little bit crazy, not totally, but you never know what that

guy's going to do, and I say that's my guy."



<p>"HISTORY IS FOR WIMPS" PRIZE -- Newsweek



<p>When Newsweek published a Dec. 3 cover story on George W. and Laura Bush, it was a

paean to "the First Team" more akin to worship than journalism. Along the way, the

magazine explained that the president doesn't read many books: "He's busy making history,

but doesn't look back at his own, or the world's.... Bush would rather look forward than

backward. It's the way he's built, and the result is a president who operates without

evident remorse or second-guessing."



<p>BLAME CERTAIN AMERICANS FIRST PRIZE -- televangelist/pundits Jerry Falwell and Pat

Robertson



<p>On the national "700 Club" TV show, with host Robertson expressing his agreement,

Falwell blamed the Sept. 11 attacks on various Americans who had allegedly irritated God:

"I really believe that the pagans, and the abortionists, and the feminists, and the gays

and the lesbians who are actively trying to make that an alternative lifestyle, the ACLU,

People for the American Way, all of them who have tried to secularize America, I point the

finger in their face and say, 'You helped this happen.'"



<p>AMERICA UNITED EXCEPT FOR THOSE DECADENT TRAITORS AWARD --

Andrew Sullivan of The New Republic and Sunday Times of London



<p>Columnist Sullivan, as if trying to prove that a gay rights advocate can be as

hysterically right-wing as a Falwell, wrote in mid-September: "The middle part of the

country -- the great red zone that voted for Bush -- is clearly ready for war. The

decadent left in its enclaves on the coasts is not dead -- and may well mount a fifth

column."



<p>SHEER O'REILLYNESS AWARD -- Fox News Channel's Bill O'Reilly and Catherine Seipp of

MediaWeek



<p>A February profile of O'Reilly in MediaWeek quoted the TV host's claim that the Los

Angeles Times had never named the woman who'd accused Bill Clinton of raping her in 1978:

"They never mentioned Juanita Broaddrick's name, ever. The whole area out here has no idea

what's going on, unless you watch my show." After it was pointed out that O'Reilly was

wrong and that Broaddrick had been repeatedly mentioned in the L.A. Times, the writer of

the MediaWeek profile, Catherine Seipp, commented that she would likely have caught the

error "if I hadn't been so mesmerized by O'Reilly's sheer O'Reillyness. There's just

something about a man who's always sure he's right even when he's wrong."

column focuses on media and politics.</i>
