Our first, short visit to Cuba has left us impressed with the

accomplishments of the island-nation which for more than 40 years has

stood up to global capitalism. We also returned home with an awareness of

many of the limits of the revolution -- some brought on or exacerbated by

U.S. economic and military pressure -- and uneasy about the difficulties

Cuba faces in the coming years.



<p>Walking into Havana's Jose Marti airport, we immediately sensed that this

was not like other places: there was no raft of billboards urging us to

drink Coke, smoke Luckies, charge with our Mastercard or rent a Hertz.

Indeed, there are virtually no commercial advertisements in Cuba. (Nor, by

the way, is there a personality cult surrounding Fidel Castro: we saw far,

far fewer images of Castro than we would, say, of President Daniel Moi in

Kenya. The omnipresent image in Cuba is national hero Jose Marti, the poet

and writer who helped lead the Cuban revolution of the 1890s.)



<p>We saw a country with major accomplishments in healthcare, education,

daycare and other services. Cuba'a infant mortality rates and life

expectancy are comparable to those of the United States and other rich

countries, and the country's main health problems are now those of rich

countries. "We die as wealthy people, even though we live as poor people,"

one hospital director told us.



<p>Cuba has invested in and maintains a sophisticated hospital system, with

hospitals spread throughout the country, not just concentrated in Havana.

Even more important is the national emphasis on preventive health measures

and primary and community care. Every person has access to a community

doctor and nurse, who serve several hundred neighborhood families and know

the health profile of everyone they serve. The women's association and

other mass organizations which are organized down to the block level also

help ensure care is delivered -- for example, making sure every pregnant

woman is receiving prenatal care. Cuba has also invested heavily in

biomedical research, giving it one of the only genuine biomedical R&D

capacities in the developing world.



<p>We were also taken with the economic egalitarianism of the society.

Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, Cuba lost more than a third of

its national income in a single year. If the United States were to suffer

anything remotely similar, there is little doubt that the heaviest burdens

would be thrust on working people and the poor. In Cuba, the pain has been

spread equally: people have maintained their right to healthcare and

education and housing, and they were allotted food rations that gave them

a minimum level of sustenance. Even in times of genuine food shortages, no

one, so far as we know, starved.



<p>The country's former economic dependence on the Soviet Union was, it

should now be obvious even to those who might once have argued otherwise,

one of the great mistakes of the revolution. Of course, this was a

dependence foisted on Cuba in no small part by the United States through

its embargo and continuous military threat.



<p>Relatedly, Cuba erred in relying on agricultural exports (sugar above all)

produced on vast state-owned plantations, instead of cultivating food for

domestic consumption on smaller, farmer-owned cooperatives. Over the last

decade, the country has made considerable strides in remedying this

mistake, with more autonomy granted to farmers and a new emphasis on

organic agriculture (Cuba is now a world leader in the field). Food,

however, still seems in short supply.



<p>One of the biggest threats to Cuba's accomplishments on the horizon is

posed by the tourism industry and the dollar economy. Cuba's greatest

potential foreign exchange earner, by far, is tourism. Tourism is certain

to grow rapidly, spectacularly so if the U.S. embargo is ever lifted.



<p>Salaries in the peso economy are on the order of $20 to $30 a month. With

subsidized or free housing, utilities, food, healthcare, education, this

is enough, or at least close to enough, to get by.



<p>Workers in the tourism sector are tipped in dollars. A maid or waiter will

easily make far more than $30 a month in tips.



<p>And so the incentive is for doctors, nurses, teachers and others to leave

their jobs and go work in the tourist sector.



<p>The result is both a misallocation of professional and skilled labor, and

the beginnings of social stratification. There is no obvious solution to

this problem that maintains the fundamental achievements of the

revolution.



<p>The problem is exacerbated by remittances from Cuban-Americans living in

Miami, and the gifts of toys, designer clothing and other items that they

provide to family in Cuba.



<p>Walking by the hip clubs in Havana's Vedado neighborhood, one can feel the

magnetic pull of the corporate culture on kids who have little way of

understanding the very dramatic sacrifices their society would have to

make were Versace and Nike goods to become freely available.
