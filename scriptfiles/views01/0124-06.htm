Corporations are fundamentally different than you and me.



<p>That's a simple truth that Big Business leaders desperately hope the

public will not perceive.



<p>It helps companies immeasurably that the law in the United States and in

many other countries confers upon them the same rights as human beings.



<p>In the United States, this personhood treatment, established most

importantly in a throwaway line in an 1886 Supreme Court decision,

protects the corporate right to advertise  (including the tobacco

companies' right to market their deadly wares), corporations' ability to

contribute monetarily to political campaigns, and interferes with

regulators' facility inspection rights (via corporate rights against

unreasonable search and seizure).



<p>But even more important than the legal protections gained by faux

personhood status are the political, social and cultural benefits.



<p>Companies aggressively portray themselves as part of the community (every

community), a friendly neighbor. If they succeed in that effort at

self-characterization, they know what follows: a dramatically diminished

likelihood of external constraints on their operations. If a corporation

is part of the community, then it is entitled to the same freedoms

available to others, and the same presumption of non-interference that

society appropriately affords real people.



<p>Especially because corporations work so aggressively and intentionally to

obscure the point, it is crucial to draw attention to the corporation as

an institution with unique powers, motivations and attributes, and to

point to the basic differences between human beings and the socially

constituted and authorized institutions called corporations.



<p>Here are 10 differences between corporations and real people:



<p>1. Corporations have perpetual life.



<p>2. Corporations can be in two or more places at the same time.



<p>3. Corporations cannot be jailed.



<p>4. Corporations have no conscience or sense of shame.



<p>5. Corporations have no sense of altruism, nor willingness to adjust their

behavior to protect future generations.



<p>6. Corporations pursue a single-minded goal, profit, and are typically

legally prohibited from seeking other ends.



<p>7. There are no limits, natural or otherwise, to corporations' potential

size.



<p>8. Because of their political power, they are able to define or at very

least substantially affect, the civil and criminal regulations that define

the boundaries of permissible behavior. Virtually no individual criminal

has such abilities.



<p>9. Corporations can combine with each other, into bigger and more powerful

entities.



<p>10. Corporations can divide themselves, shedding subsidiaries or

affiliates that are controversial, have brought them negative publicity or

pose liability threats.



<p>These unique attributes give corporations extraordinary power, and makes

the challenge of checking their power all the more difficult. The

institutions are much more powerful than individuals, which makes all the

more frightening their single-minded profit maximizing efforts.



<p>Corporations have no conscience, or has been famously said, no soul. As a

result, they exercise little self-restraint. Exacerbating the problem,

because they have no conscience, many of the sanctions we impose on

individuals - not just imprisonment, but the more important social norms

of shame and community disapproval - have limited relevance to or impact

on corporations.



<p>The fact that corporations are not like us, their very unique

characteristics, makes crucially important the development of an array of

controls on corporations. These include: precise limits on corporate

behaviors (such as actively enforced environmental, consumer, worker

safety regulations); limits on corporate size and power (through vigorous

antitrust and pro-competition policy, including limits on the scope of

intellectual property protections); restrictions and prohibitions on

corporate political activity (including through comprehensive campaign

finance reform); carefully tailored civil and criminal sanctions

responsive to the particular traits of corporations including denying

wrongdoing companies the ability to bid for government contracts; equity

fines - fines paid in stock, not dollars; creative probation, with a

court-appointed ombudsman given authority to order specific changes in

corporate activities; and restrictions on corporations' ability to close

or move facilities.



<p>There is also the permanent challenge of building countervailing centers

of people power to balance concentrated corporate power: unions above all,

plus consumer, environmental, indigenous rights and other civic groups,

organized in conventional and novel formations.



<p>And there is the imperative of directly confronting the corporate claim to

personhood and community neighbor status - both in the law and in the

broader culture.



<p>This is the beginning of a sketch of an ambitious agenda, but there is no

alternative, if democracy is to be rescued from the corporate hijackers

who masquerade as everyday citizens.
