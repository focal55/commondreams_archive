With a new hard-line Israeli defense minister promising to strike at the 

Palestinian "terrorists and their masters," it is more important than ever 

to be clear about the politics of the term "terrorism." A bit of 

contemporary history might help here.



<p>On Dec. 7, 1987, the U.N. General Assembly voted 153-2 (with one 

abstention) to approve a resolution that condemned international terrorism.



<p>The two nations rejecting the resolution were the United States and Israel.



<p>The story of those votes tells us much about the power of some states to 

label the acts of others as terrorism while avoiding accountability for 

their own terrorist acts.



<p>General Assembly Resolution 42/159 concerned "measures to prevent 

international terrorism," and was made up mostly of boilerplate phrases 

that seem hard to contest: "deploring the continuation of all terrorist 

acts," "deeply disturbed by the world-wide persistence of those acts," and 

"convinced of the importance of expanding and improving international 

co-operation."



<p>The language seems uncontroversial, until one gets to the section that 

reaffirms the legitimacy of the national liberation movements of "peoples 

under colonial and racist regimes and other forms of alien domination;" 

nothing in the resolution should be taken to deny "the right to 

self-determination, freedom and independence."



<p>The resolution also urges all states "to contribute to the progressive 

elimination of the causes underlying international terrorism and to pay 

special attention to all situations, including colonialism, racism and 

situations involving mass and flagrant violations of human rights and 

fundamental freedoms."



<p>Now the no-votes by the United States and Israel, and their positions on 

terrorism, become clearer. Both nations oppose terrorism, so long as we 

have the definitions straight.



 <p>From the U.S./Israeli point of view, violence committed by Israel against 

Palestinians is defensive. So, Israel's military occupation of the West 

Bank and Gaza, routine use of torture, arbitrary demolition of homes, and 

political assassinations are not examples of terrorism, but are simply 

necessary for defense. Palestinian violence in resistance, though always at 

a far lower level, is terrorism.



<p>Similarly, when Israel occupied Lebanon throughout the 1980s and '90s in 

violation of U.N. Security Council resolutions, the violence of that 

occupation was defensive, and Hezbollah's resistance to that occupation was 

labeled terrorism.



<p>The question is, of course, what is Israel defending? Its people, or its 

program of conquest and expansion?



<p>If we were to take seriously the moral call to end domination by colonial 

regimes, certainly Israel's occupation of Palestine would be among the 

first to be addressed. Everyone is aware of the complexity of the situation 

in Israel/Palestine, but we all should be just as aware that Israel 

occupies land conquered in war in violation of international law. That is 

colonialism.



<p>There is no doubt that both sides in the conflict have killed, and at times 

killed civilians. The 1987 General Assembly resolution deplores any taking 

of "innocent human lives," but it also acknowledges that the causes of 

terrorism often lie in "misery, frustration, grievance and despair" that 

leads people to seek radical change. Such sympathies for the victims of 

occupation and repression, and hence the resolution expressing those 

sympathies, were unacceptable to Israel and the United States.



<p>So long as the Palestinians accept the narrow limits of what was until 

recently called "the peace process," Israel is willing to grant them some 

minimal rights, mostly the right to rule over their own impoverishment.



<p>But Palestinians revert to the status of terrorists when they resist the 

daily humiliations of checkpoints, closures and random violence against 

them, or when they refuse to accept a subordinate status that allows Israel 

to retain the best land and the water resources. If Palestinians demand a 

state with true sovereignty and self-determination, the condemnations from 

Israel begin once again.



<p>If one abandons morality and considers only power, it is easy to see why 

Israeli refused to vote to condemn terrorism. It's also easy to see why the 

United States followed suit. For decades the United States has invested in 

Israel as a strategic partner to help maintain U.S. dominance in the Middle 

East. So long as policymakers see value in that strategy, the United States 

is unlikely to put serious pressure on Israel to seek not just peace, but a 

just peace, in the Middle East.



<p>The likelihood of such pressure for justice for the Palestinians will 

increase dramatically, however, if U.S. citizens understand better the 

history of the region, realize the complicity of the United States, and 

demand that U.S. policy support "the inalienable right to 

self-determination and independence of all peoples" that the U.N. 

resolution reminds us is the foundation of international law.
