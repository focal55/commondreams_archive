THE QUOTES from families of the victims suggest that in the end, behind the bravado of vengeance, there is no closure and no peace to come out of the execution of Timothy McVeigh. He is gone, but the pain he inflicted is not. He is gone, but the way we rendered him a ghost may haunt us with more trauma and more regrets than one could ever imagine, given that so many Americans assume he has by now been roasted at Satan's door.

   

<P>

  

     

<p>To be sure, execution witness Paul Howell, whose daughter died in the Oklahoma City bombing that took 168 lives, said, ''A long sigh came over my body.'' He said it was ''a big relief.''

<P>

     

     

  

     

<p>That feeling was not universal. Another witness, Larry Whicher, brother of Alan Whicher, a Secret Service agent killed in the bombing, vacillated from saying ''I'm relieved the demon has been put to death'' to ''I expected more of a sense of closure and relief than I had. It was weird.''

<P>

     

     

  

     

<p>Kathleen Treanor, who lost her 4-year-old daughter in the blast, realized as did others, that revenge was not quite so sweet. She noted how McVeigh died quietly by lethal injection, compared to the bloody horror of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building. ''I don't think anything can ever bring me peace,'' Treanor said. ''When I die and they lay me in my grave is when I'll have closure.''

<P>

     

     

  

     

<p>Closest to the truth may be Marsha Kight. Kight lost her daughter in the bombing.  Even though she attended McVeigh's trial every day, she had no interest in seeing the execution. She spent the moments of the execution with a friend along the Potomac River.

<P>

     

     

  

     

<p>''Why should I put myself in a situation to have nightmares, to witness someone die?'' Kight said. ''It doesn't make sense emotionally. I can't see where anything good can come out of this.''

<P>

     

     

  

     

<p>For all that has been said, no one can conclusively prove what good comes from the killing of a killer, and especially for those who chose to witness it. For all that has been written, the race to quote the emotion of the moment obliterated any attempt to understand the likely worth or damage of that moment in the months and years to come.

<P>

     

     

  

     

<p>If we had proof that the death penalty deters crime and truly fills a void in the families of the victims, that might be one thing. There is nothing in the field of criminology or psychiatry to prove that. If anything, what little research that has been done points the other way, toward more emptiness, more nightmares, and more disturbances among the survivors who thought this moment of vengeance would heal them.

<P>

     

     

  

     

<p>David Spiegel, a professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Stanford University, was a consultant to the Oklahoma Psychiatric Association in the aftermath of the bombing. Seven years ago, in the American Journal of Psychiatry, he and colleagues Andrew Freinkel and Cheryl Koopman published a study of 15 reporters who witnessed a 1992 execution in California.

<P>

     

     

  

     

<p>Even though the reporters had no connection to the killer, many of them had post-traumatic symptoms similar to those suffered by workers who witnessed or were within gunshot of the massacre of eight people in an office building in San Francisco in 1993. Reporters suffered stress from disorientation to detachment to despair to distressing dreams and grief.

<P>

     

     

  

     

<p>On the phone from California, Spiegel said that six months after the study, a wife of one of the reporters told him that her husband had been so irritable after witnessing the execution that ''If he covers another execution, I'm getting a divorce.''

<P>

     

     

  

     

<p>Spiegel said true healing over the bombing came from the local and national support for the families of the victims. ''You sustained a terrible loss, but you gained a community,'' Spiegel said. ''The only saving grace in that terrible moment was that people came together because everyone was affected.''

<P>

     

     

  

     

<p>Conversely, the execution in Spiegel's view only serves ''to tear the community apart,'' because of our differences over the death penalty and the question of whether another killing can somehow be healing. He thought that Attorney General John Ashcroft's use of the word ''closure'' was a political form of cruel and unusual punishment.

<P>

     

     

  

     

<p>''`Closure' is a stupid word of pop psychology, as if you can lock up all the hurt and put it away,'' Spiegel said. ''It was a disgusting political use of the families and an insult to the memories they will carry with them for the rest of their lives.''

<P>

     

     

  

     

<p>The study of the reporters told Spiegel that even detached observers of executions have an empathy that pains their hearts, if not their souls. It makes him worry for the hearts of the people who chose to view the execution. It might have been better had McVeigh been quickly put away for life, out of sight and out of mind, instead of the circus of vengeance that kept him and his remorseless face on Page One for six years.

<P>

     

     

  

     

<p>Instead of the peace many of the families sought with McVeigh's assumed descent to hell, Spiegel would not be surprised if he hears about nightmares. ''These are decent people who in no way enjoy the suffering of another human being, but from what I'm seeing, they now have to struggle with the question of, at what point do we become the person we can't tolerate,'' Spiegel said.

<P>

     

     

  

     

<p>''The wish for vengeance is understandable. But the emptiness of vengeance is hard to come to terms with ... I'm concerned that will offset any sense of euphoria or relief. I think plenty of them will suffer some more. From our research, killing doesn't heal.''
