Since the fall of 1993, when Congress passed the North American 

              Free Trade Agreement, The Capital Times has stood in militant opposition 

              to the "free trade" policies of mainstream Democrats and Republicans. 

              We have objected, again and again, to trade deals that make the 

              expansion of corporate profits a higher governmental priority than 

              worker rights, environmental protection, safeguards for consumers 

              and the preservation of family farming.

<P>From a journalistic standpoint, it has been a lonely mission. U.S 

              Rep. Marcy Kaptur, D-Ohio, the leading congressional critic of current 

              trade policy, says she knows of only two daily newspapers that consistently 

              editorialize against NAFTA. Similarly, when Congress debated permanent 

              most-favored-nation trading status for China last year, all but 

              a few newspapers sided with the corporate lobbyists who drive the 

              "free trade" agenda.</P>

<P>Does it bother those of us who edit The Capital Times to stand 

              in opposition not merely to bad government policies but also to 

              bad media policies? Not at all. William T. Evjue founded this newspaper 

              for precisely that purpose.</P>

<P>Evjue started The Capital Times in 1917 to defend U.S. Sen. Robert 

              M. La Follette, who was under attack by major newspapers in Wisconsin 

              and nationally for opposing U.S. entry into World War I. La Follette 

              believed the United States was being pulled into that European war 

              by arms merchants seeking fortunes at the cost of young lives. La 

              Follette believed, as well, in Thomas Jefferson&#146;s abiding principle 

              for the United States: "Peace, commerce and honest friendship with 

              all nations &#151; entangling alliances with none."</P>

<P>The Capital Times, at its founding and to the present day, has 

              followed the same Jeffersonian impulse that La Follette did. That 

              impulse today informs our approach to the trade debates that will 

              be the central struggles of George W. Bush&#146;s presidency. On 

              Saturday, Bush will travel to Quebec City to promote the development 

              of a Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA), under which the United 

              States would enter into the most entangling alliance in the nation&#146;s 

              history.</P>

<P>If the FTAA scheme succeeds, the United States would join other 

              western hemisphere nations in a pact that would allow an unelected, 

              unaccountable "trade resolution" panel to overrule the laws and 

              regulations of the United States and other countries if they are 

              judged to be barriers to free trade. Beyond the fact that such a 

              structure is fundamentally undemocratic, it is, as well, entirely 

              biased in favor of multinational corporations that operate on a 

              "trade uber alles" ("trade over all") ethic.</P>

<P>Global Trade Watch&#146;s Lori Wallach has referred to the FTAA 

              as "NAFTA on steroids." And that&#146;s a scary thought.</P>

<P>Since NAFTA went into effect in 1994, 23 complaints of systematic 

              violations of workers&#146; rights have been filed under the agreement&#146;s 

              structures for resolving such matters. According to Human Rights 

              Watch, "not one of the 23 complaints (has) so far resulted in sanctions 

              against an alleged labor rights violator."</P>

<P>A surprise? Hardly.</P>

<P>NAFTA was not structured to protect workers, farmers, consumers 

              or communities. And the FTAA will be even worse.</P>

<P>So The Capital Times will oppose the FTAA. Passionately.</P>

<P>That may put us out of sync with most of America&#146;s increasingly 

              monopolized and homogenized media. But that&#146;s nothing new. 

              In 1919, La Follette wrote to Evjue, "The enemies of democracy are 

              entrenched in power in every community. They speak through presidents 

              and cabinets. They rule in Congress. They are in the pulpits. They 

              control the press."</P>

<P>In opposing the latest attempt to involve America in an entangling 

              alliance designed to strangle the rights of workers, this newspaper 

              will stand on the side of those who object and protest. That will 

              place us outside the American media mainstream &#151; exactly where 

              Evjue would have wanted us.
