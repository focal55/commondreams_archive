Been working lately in America?  It’s much less likely if you’re a black 

teen.  The facts of the case are clear.



<p>This November’s jobless rate was 5.7 percent in the U.S., the highest level 

of unemployment in 75 months.  For America’s black teens, however, their 

jobless rate in November was 32.2 percent, up over 10 percent from Nov. 

2000.  This data was unreported in Dec. 8 news articles in the Washington 

Post and New York Times, economist Dean Baker noted.



<p>Presumably, black teenagers being unemployed at nearly six times the 

national rate isn’t newsworthy to such papers.  Unless, of course, a voice 

for power and wealth can score points by distorting America’s social 

reality.



<p>Consider George Will, in an editorial recently distributed by the Washington 

Post Writers Group.  He wrote, “How much would the life chances of blacks in 

urban slums or rural poverty be improved if by the wave of a magic wand 

their skins were made white?  Not much.”



<p>For Will, white-skin privilege in living and working conditions across 

America is largely an illusion.  To be sure, people are more than their skin 

color in big and small ways.  Nevertheless, what Will doesn’t see about the 

weight of the color line reveals his blindness about social reality in 

America under the market system.



<p>Under this system, workers must compete with other workers for jobs.  At the 

same time, their bosses compete with other bosses for profits.  A few 

competitors win.  Many lose, some more so than others.



<p>Just ask America’s black youth about their experiences in the job market.  

In other words, do what Will hasn’t done as a pundit with regular access to 

the corporate news media.



<p>My father came of age during the Great Depression.  In 1933, one-quarter to 

a third of American workers were out of a job, historian Howard Zinn 

estimated.  Then, people greeted each other by asking, “Are you working?”



<p>My father was fortunate.  He was able to help support his family, working 

for a time in FDR’s Civilian Conservation Corps.  Where is today’s 

equivalent for chronically unemployed black youth?  Was the federal money 

that could have been used to create jobs for them spent instead to bomb 

Afghanistan into dust?



<p>As Congress debates an economic stimulus package, some Americans are living 

in depression-like times.  The silence from Capitol Hill about the bitter 

fate of black teens unable to find work speaks loudly.
