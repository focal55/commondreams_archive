With the stock market of 2000 racking up its worst

performance in more than a decade and a half, the wrangling

between bulls and bears over what to expect in 2001 has

begun in earnest.



<p>The Nadaq's record 39 percent loss over the year (down more

than half from its peak) has shattered the illusion that

prices can be bid up to any level that investors are willing

to pay for them, and stay there. Still, many people assume

that since stocks have historically outperformed bonds, over

long periods of time, this must happen in the future.



<p>We often hear people say that they are "in it for the long

haul," as if it were guaranteed that stocks will be a good

investment if they are held for a long enough period of

time. In fact they are often told just that by investment

counselors.



<p>Ironically, it is the long-term future of stocks that looks

very bad right now. And unlike stock prices in the

short-term-- which can fluctuate wildly-- in a bubble

situation, it is the long run that one can actually say

something definitive about.



<p>What does it mean to say that there is a bubble in the

stock market? It means that the average price of stocks is

still much too high, even after the correction of 2000, to

be justified by earnings that the economy could generate in

the future. In other words, it is not possible to come up

with a future scenario consistent with anyone's projections

about the economy that would make investors want to hold

stocks for a long time-- unless stocks prices were to first

drop very steeply.



<p>Dean Baker of the Center for Economic and Policy Research

(CEPR) was the first economist to work through the

arithmetic of the bubble, and his findings have since been

confirmed by other prominent economists. It works like this:

in the long run, investors hold stocks only because of the

earnings of the underlying companies. Stockholders get a

return from two sources: the shared earnings paid in the

form of dividends, and an increase in the price of the stock

(capital gains).



<p>The average dividend payout is only about 1.5%. Capital

gains, over the long run, cannot grow much faster than the

economy-- unless you are starting from a point where stocks

are undervalued relative to future earnings. But the average

stock price relative to earnings-- known as the

price-to-earnings ratio-- is still near twice its historic

level. So unless you are willing to believe that stock

prices are unrelated to the profits of the companies they

represent, you can't expect capital gains much higher than

the long run growth rate of the economy-- at least from here

on out. That rate is currently estimated at about 2.2%

annually.



<p>That adds up to 3.7%, and even if growth turned out to be

considerably higher than the 2.2% that economists are

projecting, it couldn't solve the problem. It just doesn't

make much sense to hold stocks rather than a US Treasury

bond, which has a similar real (inflation-adjusted) return

but almost no risk. Unless you think that other investors

are going to keep bidding up the price of stocks

independently of earnings: in other words, that the bubble

will grow. But speculative bubbles can't grow forever-- even

tually they must break.



<p>Of course this analysis applies only to the whole market,

or the average stock. If you can pick the next Microsoft or

Wal-Mart and get in early enough, you could still do very

well. But this is not easy to do. So most individual and

institutional investors maintain some sort of diversified

stock portfolio that moves more with the broad market. And

at some point they are going to move out of those stocks, in

large numbers.



<p>Depending on the steepness of further market declines,

there is a real danger to the US economy. Japan's stock

market lost nearly 40 percent of its value in 1990-- a

decade later it is down even more, 64 percent from its peak

in 1989-- and its economy has yet to recover.



<p>The Japanese scenario may be less likely here, but it would

be foolish not to act before a downward spiral began. The



<p>Fed should begin lowering interest rates immediately. Both

Congress and the executive branch should abandon the

extremist and groundless economic theories-- which we could

tolerate while the economy was booming-- that advocate

paying off the national debt over the next 12 years. A

commitment to pay down the debt is a commitment to reduce

demand and slow the economy at a time when we really don't

know where the bottom of the current economic slowdown is

going to be.



 <p>The record stock market run-up has generated great wealth

for some, but not most Americans, who still own little or no

stock even in retirement funds. The majority, who did not

share in the festivities, should not get stuck paying the

bill.
