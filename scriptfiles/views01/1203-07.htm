It was 1967 and I was a fifth-grader.  Market Street in San Francisco was 

the place.  Thousands of people were protesting the Vietnam War, including 

my mother and sister.  We were there with friends to join others in a call 

to end the war.



<p>Then, many common people were dissenting against government policies at home 

and abroad.  The anti-Vietnam War and Civil Rights movements had energized 

large sections of the U.S. public.  People were participators rather than 

spectators in American democracy.  They made up the U.S. Left, broadly 

defined.  It is a long way today from that high-water point.



<p>In the 1960s, the Black Panther Party, based in Oakland, marched on the 

state capitol in Sacramento. They were making a public statement on their 

right to defend themselves and the black community generally.  This freedom 

struggle against American apartheid, in turn, had strengthened other 

movements for social justice.



<p>Richard Nixon entered the White House in 1968.  He had promised to end the 

Vietnam War.  That was good enough for many voters.  They had been 

influenced in part by the anti-war movement.



<p>Meanwhile, the sun was starting to set on the Golden Age of U.S. capitalism. 

  It had ruled the global market since the end of World War II.  American 

corporations responded partly by beginning to move factories to the Third 

World, featuring lower labor costs and weaker environmental regulations.



<p>Driven by competition for global markets, U.S. corporations needed fewer 

unionized factory workers.  Not that there was full employment then, but 

wealth was more equally produced and distributed in America.  That was 

before German and Japanese corporations began to grab market share and 

profits from their U.S. counterparts.



<p>As American corporations decreased their demand for a relatively well-paid 

and educated work force, skin-color profiling rose (never dormant) to better 

dominate the "dangerous class" in the U.S.  Their opposition to the system 

had been perhaps the most radical to circles of power.  Nixon, reelected in 

1972,  quickly caught on, crafting policies to neutralize this part of the 

Left.



<p>Take the phony Drug War.  It helped to make criminals of darker and younger 

people.  Accordingly, America now leads the world in the number of citizens 

it cages, some two million.  Those with brown complexions are 

disproportionately incarcerated.  Where was the Left during the beginning of 

the great American lockup?



<p>The nation’s political police had paved the way for this policy of reaction. 

  I mean the FBI's COINTELPRO attacks against the Panthers and American 

Indian Movement.  These vital struggles for freedom were badly damaged in 

big and small ways.  The Left is still recovering.



<p>On the ideological front, the weakening of the Left since the 1960s remains 

one of the major untold stories of the nation’s history.  Very few honest 

accounts of the rise and demise of the Left have entered America’s public 

mind through the education and communication systems, increasingly owned and 

controlled by the nation’s corporations.  They have no material interest in 

advancing news and views that promote people’s liberation from oppression.



<p>The Left was far more organized in the 1960s than it is today.  Yet 

organization is a partial explanation.  Consider two current Left movements 

around oppression at home and abroad.  One movement opposes racial 

profiling, and the other protests Iraq’s sanctioning.  Both are a part 

of—not apart from—the current crisis of the market system and thus share 

common interests.  But are these movements conscious of this?



<p>During the 1960s, the Left was able to connect some of the dots between  

domestic and foreign policies.  Such advanced positions were due in no small 

part to the independent news media that existed in America at that time.  

Avenues for such public communication are essential to popularize critical 

theory and action.  Organized labor currently has the money to fund a 

national working-class newspaper, radio and TV stations, but its 

leadership’s fatal attraction to the Democratic Party prevents this.



<p>America’s rulers now have greater political-economic power than they did 

during the 1960s, which has weakened the Left.  Then, the relative economic 

security of the Left created favorable conditions for some of them as they 

protested against the Vietnam War and for Civil Rights.  Today, such 

economic security is largely a memory.  Consequently, large numbers of the 

U.S. working-class have shaky food, health care and shelter security.  In 

fact, their material fate is a direct result of policies devised by 

corporate Republicans and Democrats.  These details, to be sure, are only 

part of a contradictory social movement story, always unfolding.



<p>Contradictions are the basis for change, as sure as night follows day.  Such 

has always been the way.  The dissenting 1960s that followed the conforming 

1950s in the U.S. prove that.  When will the American Left, down but not 

out, rise again?  Much hangs in the balance for the nation and the world.
