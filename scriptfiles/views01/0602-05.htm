<i> Secrecy and a free, democratic government don't mix.  <br>

&#151;  Harry S. Truman</i> 

<P>

Secrecy is the hallmark of the early days of the Bush administration. It was, so critics then said, the hallmark of the earliest effort of the Clinton administration. The Clinton administration's secrecy involved development of a proposal that, had it been successful, would have improved the health of a country's people. The Bush administration's secrecy involves proposals that if implemented, pose a threat to that same health. 

<P>

According to reports, the Bush Energy Development Task Force worked in mysterious ways. It was formed in early February, soon after the selection of Mr. Bush as president was formalized and it issued its report three months later. It was a small task force. It was led by two former aides to Frank H. Murkowski, the Alaska Republican who was chairman of the Senate Energy Committee. The aides, Andrew Lundquist and Karen Knutson, called themselves the Alaska jihad. They probably conjured up the name because they knew that one of their report's recommendations would include opening the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to drilling. 

<P>

When Senator Murkowski was asked what role Mr. Lundquist and Ms. Knutson played in the task force's report he said: "They don't tell me anything." Senator Murkowski was not the only one in the dark. 

<P>

Reports about the task force proceedings suggest that official Washington knew little about its operation. It was known that during its three month existence the task force met with more than 400 people representing more than 150 interested groups. As to who those people were, however, no information was available. Mr. Lundquist could not provide a list of all the groups he had spoken with "because there are hundreds I've met with." The administration said that by keeping the list of those with whom the task force met secret, the task force encouraged the free flow of ideas. 

<P>

When two Democratic members of Congress challenged the secrecy of the process, David S. Addington, counsel to the vice president, said the committee did not have to provide information about the process because all of the staff members were federal employees. 

<P>

Leaders of two dozen environmental groups asked to see Mr. Cheney but were turned down and referred, instead, to mid-level staffers. The people with whom representatives of environmental groups met refused to identify the people in charge of various parts of the study, thus preventing the representatives from having any in-depth discussions with the responsible parties prior to the report's issuance. 

<P>

Environmentalists described the meeting that did take place as "window dressing." Mr. Lundquist described the meeting as "a good conversation." John Grasser, a spokesman for the National Mining Association said: "We've probably had as much input as anybody else in town. All we know is what we read in the paper. This is a tightlipped process. I have to take my hat off to them, they've been able to keep a lid on it." Energy policy was not the only policy developed in secret. So was military planning. 

<P>

Donald Rumsfeld, the Bush administration's own Dr. Strangelove, is reportedly close to recommending that billions need to be added to the military budget. In a New York Times interview, Mr. Rumsfeld described his desire to build the missile shield, his vision for the military and his review of Pentagon policies and programs. According to the Times report, congressional and military officials have criticized the process by which Mr. Rumsfeld arrived at his conclusions as overly secretive. Pentagon officials fear that his closed door deliberations will lead to cuts in weapons programs that he doesn't like without giving consideration to those with differing opinions. 

<P>

In a meeting in April, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott complained about being "left in the dark" with respect to Mr. Rumsfeld's views. Mr. Rumsfeld disputes that. He does not suggest that secrecy promotes the free flow of ideas as did the administration. He suggests that he has met with lots of different people, including more than 100 members of Congress. It's not explained why Mr. Lott feels left in the dark. 

<P>

The Bush administration secrecy brings to mind the task force headed by Hillary Clinton  in 1993 that was charged with producing health care reform for the country. The task force was organized by the president shortly after his inauguration, and it was only a matter of weeks before conservative groups sued to open up the task force proceedings to the public, asserting that the task force was subject to the Federal Advisory Committee Act that requires all advisory committees to conduct business in open meetings unless composed wholly of full-time officers or employees of the Federal government. 

<P>

The question was whether Hillary Clinton's presence on the committee required meetings to be open. The administration said no, asserting that she was "the functional equivalent of a government employee." George Stephanopoulos said secrecy was important because if the names of the experts were disclosed, "they would become subject to lobbying, to enormous pressure, and would not be able to do the work they have to do in a short period of time." 

<P>

The secrecy explanations offered by the Clinton administration were similar to those offered by the Bush administration for the energy task force. The similarity ends there. There are no well-financed groups waiting to sue the Bush administration as there were waiting to sue the Clinton administration. The Clinton proposals would have led to improved medical care for the people of this country. The Bush proposals are almost sure to lead to further degradation of the environment and heightened tensions around the world generated by visions of a United States led by a Dr. Strangelove with a simpering president in tow.
