THE CHAOS that brought George Walker Bush to the White House is fast fading

into history as the stock of this 43rd president, and even his IQ, seem

mysteriously to be climbing. Before the election, pundits had the Texas

governor barely able to knot his string tie. Now he is being saddled up as an

adept, or soon to be adept, chief executive successor to his father and Bill

Clinton, if not quite Thomas Jefferson and Harry Truman.

<P>

    By week's end, Time Magazine's Person of the Year and his first lady will

be en route to their place among the nation's Most Admired, and she, despite

early sartorial exhibits, will be named one of the Best Dressed.

<P>

    The American heart pounds inexorably and forgivingly for its semisacred

presidency no matter how thick the transgressions of the sitting president, or

how thin his margin of victory. Having lost the popular ballot to Al Gore by,

the Associated Press says, 539,947 votes, Bush is counting on the American

public to close ranks behind his newfound appreciation for the Electoral

College.

<P>

    There will be plenty of time to gauge the unfolding of the Bush

administration, but what about the legacy of President Clinton? Much will be

made about Clinton's mark on the economy, NAFTA, Kosovo and Monica Lewinsky.

<P>

What about his mark on race relations?

    No other U.S. president ever dared handle this explosive issue unless it

was first heaved through the Oval Office window like a Molotov cocktail.

<P>

    "We don't have any burning social upheaval," Clinton said on the eve of his

big 1997 racial initiative speech in San Diego. Still, he proceeded to

establish a national diversity panel to study race relations. White

Americans-far gone in denial-maintained that the federal government had already

done enough, thank you. Thus, Clinton's race initiative, doomed from the start,

withered as a quack prescription written for a patient admitting to no known

ailments.

<P>

    Personally, it must be said that this fifth-generation Arkansan, whose

forebears were no strangers to slavery, shows more insight into race relations

than all the white politicians, lawmakers, cops, educators, landlords and

journalists heard from anywhere in the republic these days. Yet, after the end

of two full terms, he leaves much undone, by his own admission, in the area of

race relations.

<P>

    On the plus side, Clinton appointed seven key black cabinet members and

more black federal judges and commission heads and other professionals to the

federal government than any previous president. The rising economic tide of the

Clinton-era economy also lifted the boats of African Americans to relatively

new heights. The recent National Urban League report, "The State of Black

America 2000," said black unemployment, though still twice that of whites, was

at an all- time low, with a corresponding uptick in college enrollment and

housing ownership.

<P>

    In the macro area of judicial punishment and general welfare, blacks have

been somewhat battered. Clinton's omnibus crime bill left untouched the

100-to-1 ratio in the disparity in sentencing of crack and powdered cocaine

offenses. He has, curiously, petitioned the incoming Bush administration to

correct this bias, which lands great, and disproportionate, numbers of blacks

in prisons.

<P>

    This crackdown on young, first-time, nonviolent offenders has been nothing

short of devastating. The number of black juveniles charged during the Clinton

years jumped to 535,500 in 2000 from 456,072 in 1992. During the same period,

black adults in the criminal justice system increased by 276,700 to 2,149,900.

<P>

    When I once asked President Clinton about this racially biased cocaine

sentencing disparity, he said, "The situation that exists is unfair,

unjustifiable and should be changed." Yet he has found no way to change it.

<P>

    Clinton's terrible performance with this federal drug punishment matches

his sorry achievement with welfare reform and health care as they especially

affect underprivileged African Americans.

<P>

    Perhaps Clinton was indeed America's most enlightened president on racial

matters and counted blacks among his closest friends. Still, as with his

marital fidelity, his record on substantive racial issues is littered with

sweet intentions, high hopes and the double-cross.
