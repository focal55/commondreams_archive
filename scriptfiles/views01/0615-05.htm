Europe's continuing support for the Kyoto treaty and its renewed intention to ratify it even without the US was last night being interpreted by environment analysts and diplomats as a further, but perhaps final, escalation of the war of words in the run-up to the crucial Bonn meeting in July. 

<P>With neither side prepared to give way without loss of face, it is increasingly certain that the US will be diplomatically ostracised by the majority of the world community when the talks begin.  

<P>Few European heads of state had expected the Bush administration to back down. In the past few weeks, the president made it clear that it would not be possible for the US to sign up to a 5.2% decrease in carbon emissions on 1990 levels by 2012.  

<P>The new US energy policy, which heavily supports fossil fuel industries, was seen widely as a clear indication that the US was not intending to take into account carbon emissions and was prepared to risk global isolation. It is widely believed that the administration policy is largely dictated by the powerful coal and oil industries.  

<P>The hope in Europe now is that George Bush will eventually be shamed by public opinion at home and the world community at large to sign the treaty at a later stage. A revived US environment movement, increasingly involving the science community and industry, is putting pressure on the president to sign.  

<P>Opinions have been sharply divided over whether Europe should go ahead without the US. Some politicians and environment groups have argued that a treaty without the backing of the world's greatest emitter of greenhouse gases would achieve nothing. The US contributes almost 25% of global emissions, which are increasingly thought to be risking the climate system.  

<P>But a majority of groups and European leaders have consistently argued since the collapse of talks in the Hague last year that to water down a treaty already regarded as only a very small step to wards addressing the potential impacts of climate change would be both foolhardy and against their own policies. Britain has taken the lead by committing itself to cut back on 1990 carbon levels by up to 20%.  

<P>They argued that if more loopholes and exceptions were embedded in the treaty, as the US wanted, the treaty would be worse than useless and prove impossible to change at a later stage.  

<P>If Europe is serious, and this is not a negotiating position, the member states must now go ahead with a legal commitment to sign. None of the 15 has yet ratified the treaty, but there are few signs that any country will break ranks. It has been suggested that Italy, under the new rightwing president, Silvio Berlusconi, could waver at some point.  

<P>It is still not clear how much influence the US will have in getting European countries to move towards its position. In the past, it has put huge diplomatic pressure on individual countries on everything from trade to genetic engineering.  

<P>The protocol is now on a knife-edge. Should one European country waver, the whole treaty would be in danger, because Europe must ratify both as a group and as individual countries.  

<P>It is hoped that by sticking together, the member states will persuade Russia and Japan to sign with them. Without these countries, the treaty would also collapse.  

<P>The Bonn meeting, where it was hoped the mechanisms of the treaty would be thrashed out, could be one of the most explosive international conferences in years.

<P>&#149; On the Middle East

<P>We are gravely concerned by the developments in the Middle East. We welcome and support the report by the Sharm el-Sheikh fact-finding committee. We urge both sides to implement the report's recommendations, in all aspects, including ending the violence, taking confidence building measures and resuming negotiations. We welcome the constructive initiative taken by Egypt and Jordan to that end. We see no alternative... to the principle of land for peace...  

<P>&#149; On climate change

<P>We had an interesting and open dialogue here in Gothenburg on climate change, which will continue. We recognise that climate change is a pressing issue that requires a global solution.  

<P>The EU and US are both committed to providing strong leadership on climate change. Prompt, effective and sustainable action is needed, consistent with the ultimate objective of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) of stabilising greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere.  

<P>We are determined to meet our national commitments and our obligations under the UNFCCC through a variety of flexible means, drawing on the power of markets and technology. In this context, we agree on the importance of intensifying cooperation on climate-related science and research.  

<P>We disagree on the Kyoto protocol and its ratification but we are determined to work together in all relevant fora to address climate change... our efforts must ultimately result in an outcome that protects the environment and ensures economic growth compatible with our shared objective of sustainable development for present and future generations.
