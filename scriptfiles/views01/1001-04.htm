This column is dedicated to those e-mail critics who accuse me of un-American behavior, treason, or some other forms of subversion for arguing that indiscriminate bombing and strafing may not be the right response to the terrorist strike of Sept. 11.<p> Let me say unequivocally that I was shocked and angered by despicable acts of the kamikaze hijackers. Even more, I'm a native New Yorker with family members who just missed being among the thousands of casualties. I feel no sympathy for the murderous perpetrators and urge that every method be used to bring the guilty to justice. I just think it should be done in a law-enforcement effort rather than a military assault. But I'm no stranger to military action, having served four years in the armed forces during the Vietnam conflict.

<p> 



Oh, and one more thing: I have a legendary ancestor named Guinea Sultan, who long ago lived on one of the coastal islands of Georgia and reportedly never rejected the Islamic traditions he brought from Africa. I changed my name to pay homage to the only ancestor I knew connected to a time before slavery.

<p> Incidentally, researchers now estimate that at least 20 percent of all enslaved Africans shipped to the Americas from the 17th to the 19th Century were of the Islamic faith (see the book "Servants of Allah: African Muslims Enslaved in the Americas," by Sylviane A Diouf, ). There was a Muslim presence in the Americas long before many Christians arrived. So when American nativists berate Islam as a foreign religion they are betraying their ignorance. And that's only the beginning of their ignorance, but more about that later.<p> In other words, my American "bonafides" are deep and authentic. Those who dismiss my criticisms of U.S. policies as proof of some alien sensibility have it all wrong. It is just my American sense of skepticism that encourages me to seek information beyond the official line on this wrenching issue of terrorism. My American affluence has allowed me to visit other lands to witness personally the harmful effects of our government's actions.<p> American education helped convince me that the corporate media treats the American people like children. Instead of providing serious information about the amoral interplay of global politics, they feed us fairy tales about America's role as an angelic force for good. Consequently, we confront the world handicapped by red, white and blue blinders and are blindsided by those who hate us.<p> Our mass media are dedicated to increasing profit margins rather than global knowledge, so international news gets short shrift. And the small amount of global news that gets through reinforces the gauzy narrative of American beneficence. People have much against us and we need to know why. Few Americans know, for example, that the U.S. opposed every anti-colonial struggle for independence in the Third World, and that the U.S. still supports repressive governments. Remember, U.S. support made the Taliban possible and Osama bin Laden was an ally of the CIA.<p> Since the media treats us like children, we naturally respond in juvenile ways. Some Americans reacted like schoolyard bullies and attacked Muslim citizens. Our ignorance of the world was embarrassingly revealed by attacks on Sikhs, whose belief system differs considerably from Muslims. But because they wear headgear akin to that worn by bin Laden, some childish minds construed them as enemies.<p> This disjunction between reality and behavior is precisely what effective media is designed to prevent. Just as our six senses personally orient us to ensure that our behavior enhances rather than endangers our lives, the media should serve a similar function .<p> I'm a journalist, made in America, who urges media to do a better job of informing us about the negative consequences of our government's foreign policies. I urge this as patriot, not an enemy.
