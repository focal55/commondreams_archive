Despite all tales to the contrary, the World Conference Against Racism continues unabated in Durban, South Africa. If anything, the conference has more long-term significance, more color, and more diplomatic intrigue than any one report can convey.
<p>
<p>
<p>While most of the news from Durban has focused on the tensions over the U.S. walkout over language concerning Israel, another major faultline -- arguably the major policy faultine --concerns the tensions between Western nations and African nations and their descendants in the Caribbean and the Americas over reparations. 
<p>
<p>
<p>On Tuesday, in a meeting to draft a key document called the Programme of Action, fifteen nations representing the European Union walked out of the room to protest the inclusion of one phrase. Phrase 201 read: '[The group] Urges States to take measures to alleviate inequalities that still persist because of the shameful legacy of slavery.'
<p>
<p>
<p>That action should indicate how much fear talking about remedying the persistent inequalities slavery has left engenders. In fact, only France of all the European countries has ever apologized for slavery. And the move to walk out of the conference room was led by Belgium, a tiny nation which under King Leopold enslaved the Congolese and instituted the practice of cutting off hands of those who didn't comply with their wishes, something which lingers on the continent in today's civil wars. 
<p>
<p>Of course, many people would argue we're a long way from King Leopold, slavery, and colonialism today. But the United States consistently objected to including reparations in the conference agenda, and this may be one reason Secretary of State Colin Powell didn't attend the conference. In fact, the battle over reparations -- which, unlike the war of words over the Middle East actually has legal and financial implications for the United States --could have a far more lasting impact on for U.S. domestic policy. 
<p>
<p>
<p>The UNISA or University of South Africa building has a central atrium flanked by a series of ramps. Imagine the first ramp filled with a line of African-American brothers and sisters chanting: 
<p>What do you want?
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;REPARATIONS
<p>When do you want it?
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOW
<p>These members of the December 12 Movement, a group lobbying for reparations which has brought dozens of delegates to South Africa, walked into a meeting of United States Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) bearing a banner and sculptures. Faced with a hall now packed to overflowing, organizers moved upstairs to a larger classroom so that members of the U.S. official delegation could address the crowd. But the official delegation didn't even enter the room. They had big news to announce, but they stated it only to select media who came outside. The delegation was leaving, in fact, gathered security vehicles whisked them to the airport straightaway. The representatives of groups gathered inside the hall groaned in disbelief. A few cheered.
<p>
<p>
<p>Debra Smul of the Lindesmith Center/Drug Policy Foundation, who has spoken at several policy lectures on incarceration and the war on drugs, reminded the assembled group of the need to 'communicate not just for who's here in the room, but what we want the world to see.' She and others began the process of assembling a list of priorities for the non-governmental coalition, including holding an instant protest which made that evening's news; assembling another protest for the next morning, and even making moves to try to seat NGO participants in place of the official delegation. But as it turned out the next morning, the United States, probably in response to international pressure, actually left one solitary representative behind.
<p>
<p>
<p>On Tuesday a group of African-Americans, ranging from lawyers to children, in garb from business suit to mudcloth, met in a circle in the corner of the lunchroom to discuss the post-U.S.-pullout strategy. Not all were reparations activists, but those seeking reparations make up a large contingent of the United States NGO delegation, and U.S. participants make up fully 25 percent of the participants at the World Conference Against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance, the full title of the conference. Combined with the way the U.S. government has dominated the conference, the massive U.S. non-governmental influence has sometimes made this feel like a bit of an American invasion. Other delegates complain, sometimes privately, that English is over-emphasized as the main language and U.S. concerns take up too much time on the dockets. Other main issues at the conference concern the rights of India's dalits, or 'untouchables,' and whether or not the conference will promote the rights of the world's indigenous people, from Australian aboriginals to Native Americans, to self-government.
<p>
<p>
<p>In addition to taking something of center stage in the U.S. delegation, slavery and reparations are hardly just a U.S. concern. In fact, some of the most important speeches on the issue have come from representatives from Africa and the Caribbean Attorney General Awah Bah of the Gambia gave a rousing indictment of the horrors of slavery and its legacy, stating, 'Millions of Africans were killed, maimed, brutalized&#8230;Slavery was genocide&#8230;.It cost Africa and African descendants billions.' The fact that some Africans were involved in the slave trade does not absolve European nations from investigating their role in making reparations, he said, adding, 'Let us resolve to leave Durban cleansed of these ills.'
<p>
<p>
<p>Professor Hilary Beckles, head of the Barbados delegation, focused on the need for more research into the legacy of slavery in order to properly educate and empower the next generation--as well as to investigate claims on reparations. 'The silence that surrounds our experiences with genocide, slavery and colonialism has had the effect of distorting aspects of national curriculum and education pedagogy,' he said, 'thus producing an educational experience for our youth that is not always relevant and is dangerous in parts.'
<p>
<p>
<p>Noting that "the previous two conferences&#8230;to rid rid racism from the world community have not been as successful as we would have wished," Beckles called for linking the research to action. Between 1825 and 1922, France demanded and received 20 million gold francs from Haiti in exchange for its freedom and recognition in the international community. 'The logic of our history tells us that the principle of debt cancellation for developing nations is one that is morally correct and consistent with the justice of reparation which we are calling for.' He concluded, 'The contributions of Africans and people of African descent to world civilization before and after the advent of the Transatlantic Slave trade remains an important part of the silence and denial that informs the making of the modern world. Only significant advances in research, publication and curriculum development can facilitate the laying of foundations for exploding harmful myths and other forms of distortion that have enlivened racist thinking and action.'
<p>
<p>
<p>As the conference progresses, the platform language on slavery promises not only to split some delegations from others ideologically, but have a transformative impact on economic and structural racism if the delegates can reach a compromise and stick to their words.
