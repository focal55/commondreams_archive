            The Bush administration should stop undermining the U.N. conference 

            on racism and xenophobia. The administration has continually threatened 

            a U.S. boycott of the Aug. 31 meeting, which would serve only to paint 

            the administration as afraid to accept the responsibility of world 

            leadership and as unwilling to address our country&#39;s own problems, 

            past and current, on the issue of race. 

            <P> Instead, President Bush should send a high-powered delegation 

              to South Africa to show that he is willing to engage in the struggle 

              for human rights and true equality in partnership with the global 

              community. </p>

            <P> The conference comes at a time when discrimination and violence 

              against many minority groups are an almost daily occurrence. In 

              July, two instances of hate crimes against Asian-Americans highlighted 

              the prevalence of racism in the United States. </p>

            <P> In New Hampshire, an elderly Laotian man died of head trauma after 

              a Caucasian man struck him. The assailant was heard screaming that 

              he hated Vietnamese, and said it was time for payback for the deaths 

              of his relatives in the Vietnam War. Ironically, the victim had 

              fought alongside Americans as a soldier in Laos during the war. 

            </p>

            <P> And in Chico, Calif., a white man assaulted three Hmong men. He 

              then stalked one for more than a week, claiming "Vietnamese and 

              Cambodians" should go back to their own country. Asian-Americans, 

              like other minorities, feel the sting of racism in America. We are 

              prime targets for hate crimes, particularly by those who blame immigrants 

              for social and economic woes. Moreover, two-thirds of Asian Pacific-Americans 

              are newly arrived immigrants, making them even more vulnerable to 

              attacks. </p>

            <P> While immigrants should reasonably expect the U.S. government 

              to protect them from violence, the unfortunate reality is that certain 

              laws, policies and practices not only discriminate, but in some 

              cases stimulate acts of hate against them. </p>

            <P> In 1996, Republicans in Congress passed several anti-immigrant 

              laws amid public fear of terrorist threats. The hysteria peaked 

              following the Oklahoma City bombing when the media initially speculated 

              it was the work of Middle Eastern terrorists. Even though this belief 

              proved unfounded, there was a lasting public backlash against people 

              perceived to be foreign. </p>

            <P> A series of anti-immigration policies soon followed, which curtailed 

              immigrants&#39; abilities to access critical benefits, to remain 

              in the United States, to become citizens and to sponsor family members. 

              And the 1996 "welfare-reform" law stripped legal immigrants of access 

              to many of the basic safety-net programs such as Medicaid, food 

              stamps and Supplemental Security Income. </p>

            <P> The underlying message behind these laws was clear: Immigrants 

              are second-class citizens. </p>

            <P> Not surprisingly, the number of reported hate crimes increased. 

              Anti-Asian incidents, for instance, showed a significant increase 

              between 1994 and 1999, according to research done by our organization. 

            </p>

            <P> The Bush administration should demonstrate its stated commitment 

              to immigrants and minority communities in the United States by fully 

              participating in the conference, and showing by actions, as well 

              as words, that it is serious about addressing discrimination. </p>

            <P>
