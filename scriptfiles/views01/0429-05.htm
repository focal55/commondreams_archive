Through the clouds of tear gas, it looked like a reenactment of the

Battle in Seattle last weekend in Quebec City. Tens of thousands of

mostly youthful protesters marched and rallied and fought with police as

George W. Bush and 33 others heads of state from throughout the Americas

met to discuss a hemispheric trade pact.

<p>How have notions so seemingly arcane as a World Trade Organization or

a proposed Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA) fired the passions of

so many? What so enrages them about the very mention of free-trade

alliances and globalization?

<p>Many of those answers can be found in a book that has become a sort of

political manifesto for a new generation of activists committed to causes

from abolishing sweatshops to shutting down the World Bank.

Thirty-year-old Canadian journalist Naomi Klein's No Logo: Taking Aim at

the Brand Bullies articulates the wide-ranging fear and anger many young

people feel in a world they see as dominated by commercial imperatives

and corporate-friendly global trade pacts.

<p>The Times spoke with Naomi Klein, who is also a columnist for the

Toronto Globe and Mail and the London Guardian, just after the

demonstrations in Quebec.

<p>  Question: The protests of the '60s against the Vietnam War were very easy to grasp. The war was a simple, black-and-white issue, and you were

on one side or the other. The issues of free trade and globalization are

much more complex. Yet, these issues have sparked activism in a lot of

young people who previously weren't activists. Why?

<p>Answer: People went to Quebec City looking for lots of different

things. It was incredibly chaotic and decentralized. It wasn't one

protest or two protests: It was hundreds of protests. But I think that

everyone was looking for some direct participation in the political

process in the face of a feeling that power is being delegated to points

farther and farther away from where we live, and that power is

increasingly in the hands of less-transparent, more-distant institutions.

That, I think, was the feeling that united this disparate protest--a

desire to kind of reclaim democracy. Which is the same desire we heard

expressed in the streets of Seattle in 1999 and in Los Angeles during the

Democratic convention.

<p>Q: Is it just trade pacts, like the North American Free Trade

Agreement, or NAFTA, that this new generation of activists is rejecting?

<p>A: I think that people definitely are questioning more than trade.

There is a questioning of some fundamental capitalist principles,

including trickle-down economics. We have lived through an economic boom.

Tremendous amounts of money have been made under NAFTA. But, at the same

time, we see great economic disparity. Seventy-five percent of the

Mexican population lives in poverty. The minimum wage buys less now than

it did pre-NAFTA. Economic disparity has clearly increased in Mexico. Nor

has the agreement raised environmental standards as promised. According

to the Sierra Club, net pollution in Mexico has doubled under NAFTA.

<p>Q: You've been an advocate for this movement, but you've also offered

your own criticisms of it, suggesting that it has, to quote you loosely,

the potential to become like a Grateful Dead tour, with a group of young

people trailing from one summit to another, protesting outside the

fences. What problems does this movement face in growing into a mature

political movement that can clearly articulate both its objectives and

its solutions?

<p>A: I think there is an awareness that summit-hopping is unsustainable.

The real task of this movement now is to connect the global and the

local, so that it doesn't look like a roving band of Deadheads.

Essentially, every so-called global issue can be boiled down to a local

issue, to something like whether you have the right to decide whether

there is going to be a toxic-waste dump in your backyard. The movement

today has two basic types: There's this roving band of activists enjoying

triumphant moments, of which I suppose I'm a part. And then there are all

the people who are working at the local level against homelessness,

gentrification, racism, police violence. That group is asking the other,

"What the hell are you guys so happy about?" It's clear that the two

groups need to meet somewhere in the middle. I believe that process is

happening, and that we started to see it happen with the protests around

the FTAA last week. Because even though Quebec City got all the

attention, there were protests against gentrification and its

relationship to economic disparities in San Francisco. There were

protests at the San Diego-Tijuana border. There were protests in Detroit.

There's a consensus that what needs to happen next is that the movement

needs to be radically decentralized and localized. And I believe that's

already happening.

<p>Q: You've spoken a lot on college campuses. Talk a bit about today's

students.

<p>A: These kids have grown up in an era when the role of marketing is to

cool-hunt, to find and co-opt the latest, most cutting-edge, most radical

ideas coming out of this culture. But I think that growing up in that

context has pushed some people in this generation to think about what

isn't co-optable. And that's in part why I think we're seeing a deeper

questioning of the way capitalism works.

<p>Q: Were you encouraged by what happened in Quebec City?

<p>A: There is something really inspiring about the fact that in the face

of this radical individualism and atomization of our time, people still

show that they want to be part of something larger than themselves. And I

think that's fundamentally where we're at right now. I can tell you that

the thousands of people who were in Quebec City last weekend were

radicalized by their experience there, in part by how dramatically they

were shut out of the political process. A fence was built around the

city, and police used the pretext of a couple of people throwing rocks at

the fence to douse the entire city in tear gas, basically making all

assembly impossible.

<p>Q: Your critics say that you're tilting at windmills, that this

process of economic globalization is inevitable. How do you respond to

that?

<p>A: I think the most significant thing about these protesters is that

they reject that sort of fatalistic passivity. I call it the end of the

end of history. And it's really significant because the young people who

are on the streets grew up with this idea that ideology was dead, that

self-determination in the face of market forces was obsolete. And that's

precisely the passivity that they are rejecting. Just to be more

concrete, I think we've also seen some real victories. I think probably

the most significant one that came down just before the protest in Quebec

City was the fact that the multinational drug companies were forced to

drop their lawsuit against the South African government over AIDS drugs.

And that was precisely because of this tilting at windmills.

<p>Q: Has this movement had any effect on the way global trade pacts are

being negotiated and implemented?

<p>A: Well, it's very hard to measure. I do think the FTAA is clearly

under threat. But it's just a slowing down of the process, not actually

changing the course. Still, there is no doubt that the protests have

changed the way politicians talk about globalization. There has been a

re-branding process that's gone on. Globalization is now portrayed as a

vast poverty-elimination program. The World Bank exists solely to

eradicate AIDS in Africa. This is what we've seen as a response to the

protests. But what is becoming more and more difficult to ignore, of

course, is the track record. A lot of people in Quebec were talking about

the flagrant act of unilateralism made by George W. Bush right before the

Quebec summit, which was to abandon the Kyoto Protocol on climate change.

People are losing faith in the idea that we're creating a rules-based

system that everyone abides by. The U.S. is acting more and more

unilaterally, and so is Europe. What's being created is a set of rules

that's forced by the richest countries onto the poorest ones. It's almost

like unilateralism has become the new luxury item, and only the very rich

are allowed to cling to it.
