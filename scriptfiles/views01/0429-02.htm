NOT LONG ago a woman called to give me hell for a column criticizing the 

excesses of a free-market economy. "Maybe you should take a vacation," she 

began, "or go back to writing sports." Whatever the choice, any change would 

be welcome because "I am sick to death of you wagging your finger and telling 

us what bad, bad people we are. You are so unhappy."

<P>Since the woman didn't leave her name or number, I couldn't call her back 

to tell her that her assumption was only half-right. Personally, it has been 

decades since I've been as strife-free or sleeping as peacefully as I am of 

late. But as a citizen of this city, country and world, I stand guilty as 

charged: I am unhappy.

<P>My melancholy is the byproduct of living in a society that preaches a great 

game of individual worth and Christian or "family" values but which -- 

evidence abounds -- practices a far different philosophy. When we turn down 

the sound on the TV show that is "The United States 2001," and simply describe 

the action, what do we see? Basically a nation of 270 million people who -- 

whether they like it or not -- adhere to a predominant ethos.

<P>No, not "In God We Trust."

<P>More like, "There's no such thing as enough."

<P>Or, as Susan Sontag put it this month during a City Arts and Lectures 

appearance at Zellerbach Theater in Berkeley:

<P>"There is this amazing hegemony of business values, of the values of making 

money, of the commercial civilization." The result? Ours is now "a society 

which is entirely devoted to and sanctifying of the making of money."

<P>Americans have long put down other nations' aristocracies or ruling 

bloodlines. Why is the amassing of money, and the conspicuous consumption that 

tends to accompany it, a nobler standard? Why is a six-or-seven-figure salary 

a better gauge of a person's intrinsic worth than who his great-great-great 

granddaddy was or what large chunk of real estate the family once called home?

<P>Don't tell me that, here, it's all about "hard work."

<P>I can start on the first page of my address book and find a dozen people 

who work 50 times harder than Dick Cheney or Paul O'Neill ever thought of 

working -- and I wouldn't even get to the M's. But none of those folks began 

this year with financial assets of about $60 million, as did Treasury 

Secretary Paul O'Neill. Nor did any of them rake in $21.8 million during the 

last decade, as did the vice president-select (or kick in a puny $209,832 to 

charity in the same period).

<P>Then again, none of the people I know managed to snare over five years $3.8 

billion in federal contracts and taxpayer-backed loans as Cheney did for his 

pre-White House employer, Halliburton oil.

<P>No, it is not about hard work. It is now, more than ever in our history, 

about what the market will bear. And let me tell you, the market will bear an 

infinite number of atrocities and injustices, an immeasurable amount of 

degradation and deprivation.

<P>Because the market has no moral center, it can bear 1 out of 5 U.S. 

children living in poverty, about the same number growing up malnourished, and 

more than 15 percent having no health coverage.

<P>It can bear national and state lawmakers counting beans on the backs of 4-

year-olds in need of programs such as Project Head Start. It can bear those 

same lawmakers responding to the national health crisis that is drug addiction 

by building more prisons than we can staff then lowering the age limit for 

prison guards as well as the age at which we can prosecute children as adults.

<P>The market also can bear the pernicious, contradictory tension in which 

millions of U.S. women must operate. Told that quality, nurturing parenthood 

is the only acceptable standard, women also know their labor outside the home 

is crucial to keeping the economy "healthy." So is their unpaid labor when 

they get home and start nurturing.

<P>And let us not even go off-shore to see what the market will bear there. 

Suffice to say, it will bear millions of Africans dying of AIDS for want of 

affordable medicines, and men, women and children in other developing nations 

working in conditions that often make the term "sweatshop" a warm and fuzzy 

euphemism.

<P>I remember reading somewhere that what saves capitalism from ultimately 

running out of control and cannibalizing its consumer core is the collective 

understanding that profits must be used for more than reinvestment, growth and 

expansion; a substantial proportion must be committed to the health and 

perpetuation of the community as a whole.

<P>Today, that is one thing the market seems unable to bear. Doesn't that make 

you unhappy?
