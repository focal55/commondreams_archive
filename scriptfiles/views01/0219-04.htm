            Israel has just elected a prime minister who, brought before the bar 

            of international justice, would surely be judged a war criminal in 

            the class of, say, Ratko Mladic, the Bosnian Serb commander as firmly 

            associated with the Srebrenica massacre as General Sharon was with 

            that of Sabra and Shatila during the 1982 Israeli invasion of Lebanon. 

            <P>Sharon calls Yasser Arafat "a murderer and a liar" but, in the 

              run-up to the elections, the liberal Israeli press copiously illustrated 

              the deceit and sanguinary brutality which have been the twin pillars 

              of his own career. One of his likely coalition partners, Avigdor 

              Lieberman, has spoken of burning Beirut and bombing Tehran. Sharon's 

              ideas on the furtherance of the peace process make a mockery of 

              it. If any Israeli leader ever had the makings of a western villain, 

              the destroyer of US interests in the region, it is surely he. 

            <P>Yet, within a week of the emergence of this would-be villain as 

              Israel's premier-elect, who do the Americans and British bomb? That 

              old, familiar, that Arab, villain, Saddam Hussein. Of course, his 

              crimes and atrocities are of an order that words can barely encompass. 

              Keeping him from committing more is one thing, however. The motives 

              and methods of those who, once again, have assigned themselves that 

              task, and the regional context in which they do so, is something 

              else. 

            <P>The Americans and British say Friday's raid, the first on such 

              a scale for more than two years, was necessitated by the upgrading 

              of Saddam's defences and the increased threat that posed to their 

              aircraft's routine forays over the "no-fly zones". Even if that 

              argument is true, it has few takers in the Arab world. 

            <P>For the Arabs, the raid is an escalation of the Anglo-American 

              campaign against Saddam, with a far greater political import than 

              a strictly military one. Coupled with the rise of Sharon, there 

              could hardly have been a more blatant, a more richly symbolic, display 

              of the double standards which, in their view, typify western, but 

              especially American, treatment of those two zones of perennial Middle 

              East crisis, the Arab-Israeli conflict on the one hand, Iraq and 

              the Gulf on the other. It bodes ill for both. 

            <P>Each crisis has its own origins and dynamics, but they are intrinsically 

              connected. Saddam pioneered "linkage" when, immediately after his 

              invasion of Kuwait in 1990, he offered to withdraw in return for 

              an immediate, unconditional Israeli withdrawal from the occupied 

              territories. 

            <P>The offer was greeted with outrage in the west. But in due course 

              "linkage" surreptitiously asserted itself. George Bush Sr promulgated 

              a "new world order" whose cornerstone, in the Middle East, was to 

              be a just and lasting Arab-Israeli settlement. 

            <P> The US's Arab allies understood that, to achieve it, the US would 

              back away from its historic pro-Israeli bias. "Bush," said President 

              Mubarak at the time, "agrees with me that the Israelis must be pushed 

              into a Palestine solution." Fairness and firmness in one crisis 

              zone were to work wonders in the other. 

            <P>But it was not to be. Both crises have festered and worsened. Saddam 

              grows stronger and more assertive. The Arab-Israeli peace process 

              has all but collapsed; violence and mutual hatred deepens. 

            <P>Pernicious as these two crises are on their own, they achieve an 

              even higher degree of malignancy through the intrinsic connection 

              between them. And, with the ascent of Sharon, both have as their 

              key players individuals who incarnate all that is most extreme, 

              dangerous and destructive in the region. 

            <P>This, then, is the moment that the US, under a new administration, 

              has chosen to embark on a more activist policy in one zone of crisis. 

              The raid may please the Iraqi opposition, or some of it, as well 

              as Gulf countries, or some of those ruling elites most threatened 

              by Saddam, but it is deeply unpopular in the wider Arab arena. The 

              Arabs - people especially, but governments too - have been growing 

              steadily more hostile to American-led "containment" of Iraq; key 

              Arab countries are making ever greater breaches in the UN sanctions. 

              Indeed, supporting Iraq has become a necessary yardstick of patriotism, 

              even for a devoutly pro-western ruler such as King Abdullah of Jordan. 

            <P>This is not for love of Saddam but, more than ever, because of 

              "linkage" and outrage at the way the world's only superpower penalises 

              Arabs for their misdemeanours but never its Israeli ally. "It is 

              clear what the US is now about," said an Iraqi exile in Beirut. 

              "It wants erring Arab regimes to correct their priorities, to re-establish 

              Saddam, not Sharon, as the real enemy. It may have some success 

              in the Gulf, but, in general, and unfortunately for us Iraqis who 

              have most reason to hate him, it is turning him into an Arab champion 

              again." 

            <P>There could always be a miracle: in resorting to a new activism 

              against Saddam, Bush could do the same against Sharon. But, judging 

              by the lack of official alarm with which the new man was greeted, 

              he will have to wreak a great deal of havoc before the miracle occurs 

              and America begins to think of fairness, and objectivity, as a sensible 

              way for saving the Middle East from the twin calamities that surely 

              await it.
