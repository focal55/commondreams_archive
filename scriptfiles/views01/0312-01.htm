The March 8 acquittal of Jeremiah Mearday marked the second time this year

that a jury has refused to convict a "high-profile" defendant accused of

attacking Chicago police officers. On Feb. 8 a jury failed to reach a verdict

on the murder charge against Jonathan Tolliver in the shooting of Officer

Michael Ceriale.

<P>

   Both trials tell a story of how the nation's war on drugs is corroding

civility between cops and communities.

<P>



   The Mearday case began Sept. 25, 1997, when two officers brutally assaulted

him while allegedly searching for illegal drugs. The incident sparked

allegations of police brutality that made a national splash and were

thoroughly investigated by the Chicago Police Board. After a year of study,

the board concluded two officers involved in the attack should be fired;

Police Supt. Terry Hillard took that advice.

<P>

   A week following the firings of those Grand Central District cops, Mearday

was arrested by officers from the same district. Transcripts of police radio

tapes revealed officers discussing and ridiculing Mearday on the same day as

his arrest. The police denial that they had targeted Mearday strained the

credulity of the seven men and five women jurors. They acquitted the

22-year-oldMearday.

<P>

   Tolliver was not convicted of shooting Officer Ceriale during a 1998 drug

stakeout at Robert Taylor Homes. One lone juror held out and a mistrial was

declared. Interestingly, that juror was a black man who had a previous run-in

with the cops and was the closest thing to Tolliver's "peer" on the jury.

Although seven witnesses in the case recanted grand jury testimony that they

said cops forced out of them, most of the jurors apparently bought the

prosecution's argument that they recanted because of gang intimidation. During

jury deliberations, a crowd of uniformed cops clogged the courthouse and

critics charged the police were trying to intimidate the jury into a guilty

verdict. The police, including Hillard, justified the gathering as a show of

support for their fallen colleague.

<P>

   "The gangbangers were in here, and they're in uniform," said Bill Nolan,

longtime president of the Fraternal Order of Police, in defending the

courtroom presence of uniformed police. Though often bombastic, Nolan's

comments usually are a good barometer of the rank and file's feelings.

<P>

   Nolan also blasted the Mearday verdict and predicted Mearday would soon

break the law. "He's the type of person that is going to commit crime," Nolan

said. It's that attitude of "us against them" that remains the core problem

between the police department and much of the black community.

<P>

   The problem is a historical one that derives from the era of slavery and

Jim Crow segregation, but in recent years it has been aggravated by a

concentration of urban poverty and the infamous war on drugs. In many ways,

it's a set-up. The neighborhoods that produce youth like Tolliver and Mearday

are among the poorest in the nation. Lacking educational resources and

commercial enterprise, these communities provide few sources of legitimate

income or positive role models for the thousands of young people born into

them. Framed by this reality, many youth see the underground economy as a

logical economic option. But their choice of employment also makes them enemy

soldiers in the war on drugs. Into this mix we send well-meaning but

inexperienced young men like Michael Ceriale to fight this war, and we sit

back and watch the inevitable conflict.

<P>

   We've cast cops and young black men as antagonists in this battle. The toll

is apparent on the black community as the numbers of black inmates continue to

skyrocket and jail culture grows even more pervasive.

<P>

   The police are not to blame for this war; they are the foot soldiers hired

to do society's dirty work. We arm them with weapons and the power of coercion

and then turn our backs on the battle. Police then form insular cultures and

"blue walls" of silence as protection from society's indifference.

<P>

   Unfortunately, that isolation nurtures the "us versus them" attitude that

sometimes justifies thuggish behavior. Nolan's bellicose reactions to the

Mearday verdict last Thursday exemplify this irrationality. "I hope it doesn't

send the signal that police are going to be punching bags, because they are

not," the FOP president told reporters. "I don't think Mr. Mearday should feel

he's immune to being arrested again."

<P>

   As long as society fights the problem of substance abuse through the

criminal justice rather than the public health system, we will nurture an

insular police culture that justifies brutality in the name of war.
