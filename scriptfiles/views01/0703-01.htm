For those who agree with the British diplomat and writer Arthur Ponsonby that "when war is declared, Truth is the first casualty," it's a good idea to examine the Bush administration proposal for "new, smart sanctions" against Iraq, which is scheduled to be voted on today by the U.N. Security Council.

<p>

Since they're being called "smart sanctions," doesn't that mean what critics have been saying for years is right - that the current sanctions are, well, dumb?

<p>

Among those critics are two former senior U.N. officials of impeccable integrity - Denis Halliday <IMG align=left hspace=14 vspace=14 SRC=images/seanlogo.jpg WIDTH=94 HEIGHT=124 BORDER=0>and Hans von Sponeck, who resigned their posts in protest, calling the sanctions "genocide." That's the word used by even the conservative Scott Ritter, a career military man and former UNSCOM chief inspector in Iraq.

<p>

The main change with the "smart sanctions" is that a list will be drawn up, laying out what military or "dual-use" items will be prohibited, instead of the current policy in which imports are allowed into Iraq only if they are on the list of allowable goods.

<p>

Proponents argue that the new plan will increase the amount of goods that flow into Iraq so that the general civilian population will not unduly suffer as they have over the past decade, while tightening the controls on any imports that could be used for military purposes.

<p>

The current sanctions call for 100 percent, quantitative disarmament of Iraq's Weapons of Mass Destruction program. When UNSCOM was pulled out of Iraq in 1998, Iraq's WMD program had been qualitatively dismantled, according to Ritter.

<p>

Unfortunately, Ritter adds, the 100 percent benchmark is not only impossible to reach, it's being used to justify the sanctions indefinitely, giving Iraq no incentive to comply; to say nothing of the likelihood that Iraq will never be able to pay off the war reparations claims, totaling $320 billion as of October.

<p>

Analyzing statements of U.S. officials, it appears the motivation behind the "smart sanctions" is to shift public opinion away from blaming the sanctions for the humanitarian crisis in Iraq.

<p>

In an excellent analysis of the new proposal by the director of Inter-Church Action, a coalition of Canadian churches and agencies working on issues of "development, relief and justice" in Africa, the Asian-Pacific and Latin America, Dale Hildebrand quotes a U.S. official: "In reality, this is a change in perceptions. Most people think Iraqis are starving because the evil West is keeping medicines away... . We're taking the tool of sanctions as propaganda away from Saddam."

<p>

The list prohibiting explicit military hardware is a no-brainer, given Saddam's heinous human rights record. However, the list of banned "dual-use" items requires close scrutiny.

<p>

For example, given the centrality of computer technology to any modern economy, how will the smart sanctions determine what components are for civilian purposes and which are likely to be used for military purposes?

<p>

"An American official involved in drawing up the new lists of banned items said that the new plan is designed to prevent Iraq from acquiring weapons of mass destruction, missiles, and the technologies to build them," Hildebrand points out.

<p>

"The concept of dual-use, when applied not only to specific physical goods but also to capabilities and technologies, can quickly become a pretext for blocking development of large segments of the civilian economy," he writes.

<p>

Another key component of the sanctions is the Oil-For-Food program, which U.S. planners point to as evidence of our humanitarian concern. Tragically, the operation of the program is grossly misunderstood by most Americans, who would otherwise likely be in opposition to its current set-up.

<p>

Von Sponeck, who ran the U.N. program until he resigned in protest, explains that the $2 billion in oil that Iraq is allowed to sell every six months translates into $182.70 per person, per year. That's $15.23 a month. The Security Council deems those provisions sufficient for all the needs of Iraqi citizens, even though von Sponeck has explained in detail, on numerous occasions, the deficiencies of a system that controls Iraq's entire economy from Security Council offices. (Interesting that free-market cheerleaders aren't decrying the evils of that command economy.)

<p>

Hildebrand's conclusions are worth pondering. "While the proposed changes may lead to some improvements for the people in Iraq - it is apparent that they do not equate to the radical changes in policy...that are needed to address one of the most serious humanitarian and political crises in recent history."

<p>

As former U.S. attorney Kate Pflaumer reminded us in her op-ed piece two weeks ago, it's difficult to take seriously "the rule of law" when the leaders of the free world bomb civilian infrastructure in violation of the Geneva Convention and violate the U.S. statute on terrorism by creating and maintaining life-threatening conditions to coerce a sovereign nation and its civilian population.
