During the first two days of this month, CNN's website displayed 

an odd little announcement. "There have been false reports that CNN has not 

used the word 'terrorist' to refer to those who attacked the World Trade 

Center and Pentagon," the notice said. "In fact, CNN has consistently and 

repeatedly referred to the attackers and hijackers as terrorists, and it 

will continue to do so."



         <p>The CNN disclaimer was accurate -- and, by conventional media 

standards, reassuring. But it bypassed a basic question that festers 

beneath America's overwhelming media coverage of recent weeks: Exactly what 

qualifies as "terrorism"?



         <p>For this country's mainstream journalists, that's a non-question 

about a no-brainer. More than ever, the proper function of the "terrorist" 

label seems obvious. "A group of people commandeered airliners and used 

them as guided missiles against thousands of people," says NBC News 

executive Bill Wheatley. "If that doesn't fit the definition of terrorism, 

what does?"



         <p>True enough. At the same time, it's notable that American news 

outlets routinely define terrorism the same way that U.S. government 

officials do. Usually, editors assume that reporters don't need any formal 

directive because the appropriate usage is simply understood.



         <p>The Wall Street Journal does provide some guidelines, telling its 

staff that the word terrorist "should be used carefully, and specifically, 

to describe those people and nongovernmental organizations that plan and 

execute acts of violence against civilian or noncombatant targets." In 

newsrooms across the United States, media professionals would agree.



         <p>But -- in sharp contrast -- Reuters has stuck to a distinctive 

approach for decades. "As part of a policy to avoid the use of emotive 

words," the global news service says, "we do not use terms like 'terrorist' 

and 'freedom fighter' unless they are in a direct quote or are otherwise 

attributable to a third party. We do not characterize the subjects of news 

stories but instead report their actions, identity and background so that 

readers can make their own decisions based on the facts."



         <p>Since mid-September, the Reuters management has taken a lot of 

heat for maintaining this policy -- and for reiterating it in an internal 

memo, which included the observation that "one man's terrorist is another 

man's freedom fighter." In a clarifying statement, released on Oct. 2, the 

top execs at Reuters explained: "Our policy is to avoid the use of 

emotional terms and not make value judgments concerning the facts we 

attempt to report accurately and fairly."



         <p>Reuters reports from 160 countries, and the "terrorist" label is 

highly contentious in quite a few of them. Behind the scenes, many 

governments have pressured Reuters to flatly describe their enemies as 

terrorists in news dispatches.



         <p>From the vantage point of government leaders in Ankara or 

Jerusalem or Moscow, for example, journalists shouldn't hesitate to 

describe their violent foes as terrorists. But why should reporters oblige 

by pinning that tag on Kurdish combatants in Turkey, or Palestinian 

militants in occupied territories, or rebels in Chechnya?



         <p>Unless we buy into the absurd pretense that governments don't 

engage in "terrorism," the circumscribed use of the term by U.S. media 

makes no sense. Turkish military forces have certainly terrorized and 

killed many civilians; the same is true of Israeli forces and Russian 

troops. As a result, plenty of Kurds, Palestinians and Chechens are grieving.



         <p>American reporters could plausibly expand their working definition 

of terrorism to include all organized acts of terror and murder committed 

against civilians. But such consistency would meet with fierce opposition 

in high Washington places.



         <p>During the 1980s, with a non-evasive standard for terrorism, news 

accounts would have routinely referred to the Nicaraguan contra guerrillas 

-- in addition to the Salvadoran and Guatemalan governments -- as 

U.S.-backed "terrorists." Today, for instance, such a standard would 

require news coverage of terrorism in the Middle East to include the 

Israeli assaults with bullets and missiles that take the lives of 

Palestinian children and other civilians.



         <p>Sadly, the evenhanded use of the "terrorist" label would mean 

sometimes affixing it directly on the U.S. government. During the past 

decade, from Iraq to Sudan to Yugoslavia, the Pentagon's missiles have 

destroyed the lives of civilians just as innocent as those who perished on 

Sept. 11. If journalists dare not call that "terrorism," then perhaps the 

word should be retired from the media lexicon.



         <p>It's entirely appropriate for news outlets to describe the Sept. 

11 hijackers as "terrorists" -- if those outlets are willing to use the 

"terrorist" label with integrity across the board. But as long as news 

organizations are not willing to do so, the Reuters policy is the only 

principled journalistic alternative.
