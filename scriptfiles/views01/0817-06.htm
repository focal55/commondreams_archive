            Are Americans becoming heartless? Are we less sensitive to others? Is our

society really becoming corrupt and degraded?



<p>As we follow American corporate media today we could only answer yes to

each of these questions. Washington sex scandals, celebrity exposés,

gruesome murders, schoolyard attacks, gangs, crime, corruption, and

conspicuous consumption fill the airwaves and newspapers. Media

representatives say they need to protect their bottom-line, and that these

types of news and fictionalized stories increase ratings. Corporate media

seem to have abdicated their First Amendment responsibility of keeping the

public informed. The traditional journalist values of supporting democracy

by maintaining an educated electorate now take second place to profits and

ratings. When questioned about the appropriateness of sensationalized news

coverage and heartless human episodes, corporate media responds by saying,

"we are just giving the public what it wants." Media shift the

responsibility for sensationalized coverage to a prurient citizenry's

market demands for more blood, gore and opulence.



<p>Is the public really screaming for more body dissections, crime coverage,

and gossip news? Are ordinary people to blame for this daily parade of

heartless gluttony?



<p>Somehow I firmly believe that as a society we are just as innately

compassionate and sensitive as ever. I ask my freshmen classes each

semester what the most important values are in their lives. After a brief

discussion, wealth and material acquisitions are invariable dismissed and

core personal values of love, friendship, trustfulness, emerge to the

forefront.



<p>As a former director of a family service center in Dixon, California, I

remember the dozens of phone calls offering help when our local newspaper

covered the plight of a homeless family.



<p>The willingness to care, love, build friendships, and respond to the needs

of others is very much alive in American society. Regretfully, we have been

led to believe otherwise. Because of the enormous coverage of Gary Condit,

Monica Lewinski, and Columbine, we tend to believe that we are all somehow

less then we were-that we live in a "Survivors" society. We watch with

increasing numbness the killings and scandals. Through limited daily

personal interactions we amplify the very essence of our numbness through

media fed gossip with our friends and associates. We blame human nature and

believe the worst about ourselves. The spiral turns inward, twisting the

soul of society into an alienated artificiality. We hide in gated

communities, consuming media-supplied episodes of fear, disgust and

lovelessness.



<p>How can we resist? Individual isolation or rejection of all media is not a

societal answer. (I gave my TV away fourteen years ago, but I remain a

media activist.) Responsibility for media content lies with the media

themselves. We need to collectively ask corporate media to return to

covering the important issues of our day and away from sensationalized

hype. If they fail to listen, our task is to re-diversify media by creating

media options in our daily lives. By using the technologies available to us

today, we can connect with independent news and entertainment services all

over the world and share our stories. In the past two years a global

Internet news system has emerged, involving over sixty-five independent

news centers in a dozen countries, with another thirty planning to come

online in the next few months. They can be seen on the Internet at

www.indymedia.org. There is now Indymedia radio and special files for

printing newspapers for local distribution. Indymedia and similar groups

show us that we can re-build media from the bottom up. We can share our

success stories, maintain an informed electorate, and reconnect to our

communities' heartfelt values.



<p>Independent media comes from the people and is emerging around us. Local

cable TV, independent radio and micro-transmitted radio, alternative

newsmagazines and newspapers are everywhere. We can add to and expand these

vital sources of news and entertainment and, in the process, reconnect with

our society and ourselves. We can tell the stories of struggling and

overcoming together-stories that strengthen and unite our hearts.
