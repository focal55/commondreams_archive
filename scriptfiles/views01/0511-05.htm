TO WIN SUPPORT for his proposed $1.6 trillion tax cut over 10 years, 

President Bush has continually asserted that the American taxpayer has been 

overcharged, resulting in a "surplus" in the federal budget. This surplus, he 

argues, should now be returned -- with nearly half of the trillion-plus 

dollars going to the richest 1 percent.

<P>This week the House and Senate approved the President's budget for 2002, 

which constitutes a victorious first step toward his 10-year tax cut (reduced 

by Congress to only $1.3 trillion) and begins it with a $100 billion tax cut 

for this year (retroactive to January 1) and next year.

<P>But is there really a gargantuan surplus in the federal budget?

<P>Twenty years ago, the Reagan administration, with the support of many 

Democrats, was able to pass a similarly huge tax cut -- benefiting the very 

rich and drastically reducing federal programs of all sorts (except for the 

defense contractors) in order to "get government off our backs."

<P>One result of Reaganomics was a tripling of the national debt so budgets 

for needed public programs and agencies had to remain at drastically reduced 

levels throughout the 1990s while the federal debt was largely but not 

completely paid down. During the recent budget debates in Congress, neither 

the Democrats, nor the moderate Republicans, nor the president, nor the media 

has focused attention on a wide area of governmental funding that has been 

kept at levels far below efficiency since the Reagan era: Guarding the health 

and safety of the American public via regulatory agencies that check for 

problems in food and food additives, drugs, manufactured products, and in the 

workplace and the environment. It is unlikely that the "Middle Americans" 

rounded up for photo-ops at President Bush's recent rallies for "Tax Relief 

Now!" are aware of the following critical situations, each of which could well 

directly affect their families:

<P>The federal Food and Drug Administration is so underfunded and understaffed 

that its investigators are currently able to sample less than 1 percent of all 

foods offered for import into the United States. The FDA's Web site states 

openly that "there are now serious gaps between what the agency needs to do 

and what it can do."

<P>Funding for the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration has 

been cut so severely that only 100 people are currently working on developing 

workplace standards for the thousands of toxic substances and for other safety 

hazards in factories and chemical plants at hundreds of thousands of sites.

<P>The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is supposed to regulate 

the entire motor transportation industry with a budget that is 30 percent 

lower than in 1980 and with only 15 investigators. The budget cuts for the 

federal Environmental Protection Agency have reduced the travel allowance for 

inspectors while their territories have been increased. In any event, the 

enforcement capability of the EPA was gutted by the Clinton administration, 

which ordered it to shift from issuing citations for pollution violations to 

merely offering "compliance assistance," a program in which fines and 

prosecution have been replaced by advice.

<P>Most of the 76 million illnesses and 5,000 deaths caused annually by food-

borne pathogens fall within the jurisdiction of the U.S. Department of 

Agriculture. As in other agencies, the USDA's regulatory authority has been 

drastically curtailed in recent years.

<P>Since 1996, inspection of meat and poultry plants has been guided by the 

Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point system, in which the companies 

create their own plan for identifying any safety problems "at key points" and 

their own methods to address them. Federal inspectors are then allowed to 

examine only the problem areas identified by the company.

<P>They are almost never permitted to close a plant anymore, even after it has 

accumulated several warnings about filthy conditions, which have subsequently 

caused outbreaks of e. coli infections among consumers.

<P>Why have both major parties voted in Congress over the past 20 years to 

burden regulatory agencies with layers of new procedures and rounds of 

consultations with "stakeholders" that nearly paralyze the process of setting 

standards?

<P>Why have their operating budgets been continually squeezed?

<P>Why was the over-burdened, underfunded federal regulatory system not an 

issue for either Gore or Bush during the campaign last year -- in spite of 

myriad testimonies before congressional committees about the present dangers?

<P>Why did President Bush propose a budget that maintains or worsens the 

crisis in under-regulation?

<P>The simple reason: Big business does not want to be regulated. It has 

expressed this position loudly and clearly via huge campaign contributions to 

both major parties. There is no enormous "surplus" in the federal budget and 

no need to drastically slash government revenue for the coming decade -- 

unless one agrees with President Bush that whatever big business wants is good 

for America -- and the public be damned.
