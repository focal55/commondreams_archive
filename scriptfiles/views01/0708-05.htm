SNOWMASS, Colo.<wbr>--<wbr>Buoyed by a supportive White House, growing climate concerns,

temporarily high gas prices, and California's electricity mess, the

nuclear industry is running an all-out public-relations campaign to

resuscitate its product. This attempt ignores one crucial fact: Nuclear

power already died of an incurable attack of market forces. Once touted

as "too cheap to meter," nuclear power, as The Economist recently

concluded, now looks "too costly to matter."

<p>

Overwhelmed by huge construction and repair costs around the world,

nuclear plants ended up achieving less than 10% of the capacity and 1% of

the new orders (all from countries with centrally planned energy systems)

forecast a quarter-century ago. The industry has suffered the greatest

collapse of any enterprise in industrial history.

<p>

Beyond the hard economic facts, about which more later, the nuclear

industry is dismissing legitimate public concerns about the risks of a

technology so unforgiving that, as Nobel physicist Hannes Alfven wrote,

"No acts of God can be permitted." Each nuclear plant, through accident

or malice, could release enough radioactivity to hazard a continent. This

is presented by the industry as extremely unlikely, but many citizens

aren't reassured. They have seen too many highly improbable events,

including terrorism. And if nuclear power plants are so safe, why would

the industry build and run them only if the federal government passed a

law limiting operators' liability in major accidents? Why should the

nuclear industry enjoy a liability cap that reduces its incentive for

safety, distorts choices with a vast subsidy and is unavailable to any

other industry? Why can't nuclear operators self-insure and put their

money where their mouths are, or buy insurance at market prices like

everyone else? The liability law's expiration in 2002 presents an awkward

dilemma for advocates of both nuclear power and free markets.

<p>

Scientists still haven't developed reliable ways to handle nuclear

wastes and decommissioned plants, which remain dangerously radioactive

for far longer than societies last or geological foresight extends. And

experts feel nuclear power's gravest risk is that power plants can

provide ingredients and innocent-seeming civilian cover for the

development of nuclear bombs, as was the case in India and elsewhere. Now

the White House proposes to revive nuclear-fuel reprocessing after

decades of proof that it's unprofitable, unnecessary, a complication to

nuclear waste management and a source of vast amounts of bomb material.

<p>

Market economics provides an even more basic argument: "If a thing is

not worth doing," said economist John Maynard Keynes, "it is not worth

doing well." Leaving aside bomb-proliferation, waste, sabotage and

uninsurable accidents, nuclear power is simply uncompetitive and

unnecessary. After a trillion-dollar taxpayer investment, it delivers

little more energy in the U.S. than wood. Globally, it produces

severalfold less energy than renewable sources. The market prefers other

options. In the 1990s, global nuclear capacity rose by 1% a year,

compared with 17% for solar cells (24% last year) and 24% for wind

power--which has lately added about 5,000 megawatts a year worldwide, as

compared with the 3,100 new megawatts nuclear power averaged annually in

the 1990s. The decentralized generators California added in the 1990s

have more capacity than its two giant nuclear plants--whose debts

triggered the restructuring that created the state's current utility

mess.

<p>

Enthusiasts claim new-style reactors might deliver a kilowatt-hour to

your meter for 5 cents, compared with 10 to 15 cents for post-1980

nuclear plants worldwide. (Of that, 10 to 15 cents, nearly 3 cents pays

for delivery, about 2 cents for running the plant, and the rest for its

construction and for occasional major repairs.) But on the same

accounting basis, superefficient gas plants or wind farms cost only 5 to

6 cents per kilowatt-hour, cogeneration of heat and power often 1 to 5

cents, and efficient lights, motors and other electricity-saving devices

under 2 cents, often under 1 cent. Cogeneration and efficiency are

especially cheap because they occur at the site where the energy is

consumed and thus require no delivery.

<p>

All these non-nuclear options continue to get cheaper, as do fuel

cells and solar cells. Today, a pound of silicon can produce more

electricity than a pound of nuclear fuel. Already, Sacramento's municipal

utility, which has successfully replaced power from its ailing nuclear

plant (shut down by voters) with a portfolio emphasizing efficiency and

renewables, has brought the heretofore costliest option, solar cells,

down to costs competitive with a new nuclear plant.

<p>

The PR spinners trumpet that nuclear power costs less than power from

gas plants. This is true if you are looking only at the running cost of

an average existing nuclear plant , compared with the running costs of an

old, inefficient gas-fired plant. It does not include delivery to

customers, nor the prohibitive construction costs of a new nuclear plant.

Notice, too, the ads don't compare the costs of a new nuclear plant with

the new, doubled-efficiency gas plants that are beating the pants off

nuclear and coal worldwide. Under such realistic cost comparisons,

nuclear power plummets to its actual status as the worst buy available.

You didn't understand that from those slick ads? You weren't supposed to.

The nuclear industry has a well-earned reputation for breezy mendacity.

<p>

Lost in the debate over what kind of new plant to build is the best

option of all: more efficient use of the electricity we already have.

We've been reducing electricity use per dollar of gross domestic product

by 1.6% a year nationwide, and in California between 1997 and 2000, by

4.4% a year. California has held its per-capita electricity use

essentially flat since the mid-1970s, yet far more savings remain

untapped--enough nationally to save four times nuclear power's output, at

one-sixth its operating cost. Our personal household electric bill, for

example, is $5 a month for a 4,000-square-foot house in the Rocky

Mountains. Passive solar design and super-efficient appliances and

lighting yielded a 90% savings on electricity and 99% on fuel. The

improvements, made in 1983, paid for themselves in 10 months. Today's

technologies are far better. An estimated three-fourths of U.S.

electricity could now be saved through efficiency techniques that cost

less than generating that power, even in existing plants.

<p>

Nor, finally, do shortages of electricity in California justify more

nuclear plants anywhere. California did not have soaring electricity

demand during the 1990s, did not stop building power plants and is

probably not even short of generating capacity. The system that had

rolling blackouts at a 28-gigawatt load last winter is the same one that

comfortably delivered 53 gigawatts two summers ago. Half its power plants

didn't suddenly evaporate. Rather, there's apparently been adequate

generating capacity--if power plants ran as reliably as they did before

utilities sold them. But in fact, since utility maintenance contracts

expired last fall, many of the sold plants have been calling in

sick--often, some evidence suggests, because their new owners earn far

more profit by selling less electricity at a higher price rather than

more at a lower price.

<p>

If California does have a serious supply-demand imbalance, it should

be resolved in the cheapest, fastest, surest and safest ways. Buying more

nuclear plants violates all these criteria. It would buy less solution

per dollar, making the problem worse. That's also true of nuclear

solutions to climate change.

<p>

Anyone who doubts the effectiveness of demand-side solutions need only

to look to California, where in the first half of this year, with limited

formal programs, Californians have decreased their peak demand for

electricity by more than 12%, reversing the past 5 to 10 years' growth in

demand.

<p>

After a half-century of nuclear power, the verdict of the marketplace

is in. Nuclear power has flunked the market test. Nuclear salesmen scour

the world for a single order, while makers of alternatives enjoy brisk

business. Let's profit from their experience. Taking markets seriously,

not propping up failed technologies at public expense, offers a stable

climate, a prosperous economy, and a cleaner and more peaceful world.
