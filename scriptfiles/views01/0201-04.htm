Elaine Chao, the new labor secretary, poses as great a risk to the lives of working immigrants and people of color as Linda Chavez, President Bush's first labor nominee.<P>



   As Asian-Americans who seek to advance the movement for justice, dignity and true democracy -- not only among those formally recognized as laborers, but among the millions who work under low-wage and no-wage conditions -- we vehemently regret her confirmation.

<P>

Chao staunchly opposes the idea that racism limits some people's opportunities. She argues that the conservative values of hard work and individualism will result in success regardless of color or ethnicity. Thus, she dismisses the long history of African-American, Asian-American, Latino and American Indian communities that have struggled to improve their lives.

<P>



   An advocate of the flat tax, Chao believes rich and poor should pay the same taxes. Her reason? With the money they save, rich people will give more to charity.<P>



   Chao has dedicated her life to implementing the conservative agenda. She held several high-level positions within the Reagan and Bush Sr. administrations. Her political world view can be summed up by the mission statement of the Heritage Foundation, where she chaired the Asian Studies Center Advisory Council: ``To formulate and promote conservative public policies based on the principles of free enterprise, limited government, individual freedom, traditional American values and a strong national defense.''<P>



   The Heritage Foundation has been at the vanguard of advancing some of the most damaging policies against poor women, such as eliminating their income supports, all in the name of advancing a culturally conservative agenda: promoting nuclear families, policing sexuality and denying ``privileges'' to the historically oppressed.<P>



   In other words, Chao's priority as labor secretary will be to further U.S. business interests while scaling back government protections for workers. This is frightening for all poor communities, not the least of which is the Asian immigrant poor.<P>



   As with the Linda Chavez nomination, Chao provides the appearance of ``advancement for communities of color'' -- in the form of an Asian-American woman in the president's Cabinet. In reality, her appointment spells disaster for those who already are the most vulnerable of the working poor.<P>



   Take the Chinese immigrant who labors in a garment sweatshop for more than 12 hours a day for less than the minimum wage. Under the leadership of Chao, this worker's hopes at a minimum wage (or better) have been dashed. Chao has made no commitment to raising it. In fact, she wants to give states the right to opt out of any minimum wage hike, stressing that such a hike would discourage job growth in economically depressed areas. Here, laborers are given one of two choices: Continue in working poverty or languish in jobless poverty.<P>



   Chao has not committed to leaving in place occupational safety regulations passed by the previous administration. For instance, regulations that seek to reduce repetitive stress injuries -- very often a condition suffered by immigrant workers in assembly-line and garment sweat shops -- are being targeted by Republicans for the legislative scrap pile. Chao has not sought to defend these regulations.<P>



   Neither is Chao a champion of the most vulnerable workers in the country: those living in poverty. During her tenure as president of the United Way, she focused primarily on the advancement of the high-tech job sector.<P>



   Asian-American communities have a particular responsibility to speak out against Chao. Far from being a model of Asian-American ``empowerment,'' Chao's selection is a dark day for Asian-Americans. Far from being the embodiment of the American dream -- as her paternalistic colleagues like to suggest -- she is a nightmare for the working poor. In the aftermath of the Chavez controversy, it seems as if mainstream unions and progressive groups have either given Chao their approval or been silent. Their silence will come back to haunt us.
