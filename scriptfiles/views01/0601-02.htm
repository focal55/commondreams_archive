TWENTY YEARS AGO, I was working as a consultant to the state Assembly 

Health Committee. My job required me to read a wide range of publications 

concerning various health and medical issues.

<P>I remember reading that first report of gay men with Pneumocystis pneumonia 

and feeling uneasy enough to clip the article and tack it to my bulletin board.

<P>Five years later, almost everyone I knew would be dead or dying.

<P>At that time, Castro Street had been my home for eight years. The late 

1970s were years of tumult in San Francisco, particularly for the nascent gay 

and lesbian community. Anti-gay initiatives organized by conservative 

Christian groups were sweeping the nation. Gay rights ordinances were repealed,

<P>gay/lesbian churches were torched and violent attacks from gay bashers were 

common. Tens of thousands of gay men and lesbians were immigrating to San 

Francisco in search of a new community. Most headed for Castro Street.

<P>Under the tutelage of gay rights leader Harvey Milk, I became a gay rights 

activist. The assassinations of Milk and Mayor George Moscone on Nov. 27, 1978, had mobilized the collective grief and rage of the gay and lesbian community 

in a way which we had never experienced.

<P>A few months after tacking that federal Mortality and Morbidity Weekly 

Report to my wall, I got a telephone call at my new job working for 

Assemblyman Art Agnos. Dr. Marcus Conant, a dermatologist at UCSF, asked if I 

was familiar with the cluster of Pneumocystis pneumonia and told me he had 

patients suffering from it and a rare disease called Kaposi's sarcoma. Dr. 

Conant invited me to the hospital and took me to the room of a young man named 

Simon Guzman. It was my first glimpse of a human being destroyed by the new 

disease.

<P>And then it began. It is hard to convey the horror of those early years 

before the cause was known, before treatments were developed. The fear was 

palpable and nowhere was the fear greater than on Castro Street. People died 

very quickly then and they were dying all around us.

<P>By the autumn of 1985, Castro Street was decimated. In mid-November, my 

friend Joseph Durant and I were walking Castro Street putting up posters 

announcing the annual Candlelight March for Harvey Milk and George Moscone. We 

stopped for pizza at the corner of Market and Castro and picked up a copy of 

The Chronicle. The headline said "1,000 San Franciscans killed by AIDS." We 

realized that almost all of those 1,000 lived within a 10-block radius of 

where we stood. We were standing at ground zero.

<P>On Nov. 27, we gathered at the corner of Market and Castro to begin the 

march to City Hall. Durant, Gilbert Baker, Bill Paul and I had earlier printed 

the names of our dead friends on cardboard placards.

<P>We brought blank placards and magic markers to the crowd and people began 

to write the names of their loved ones who had also died. We marched to City 

Hall, left our candles on the steps and walked to United Nations Plaza. We had 

hidden extension ladders nearby, and when the police were distracted, we 

leaned them against the Old Federal Building and taped the placards to the 

gray stone facade. I looked at the patchwork of names covering the gray stone 

facade and thought to myself, "It looks like a quilt."

<P>I thought about that image for 18 months. During that time, three things 

happened that changed my life forever: I tested HIV-positive, I was attacked 

and stabbed by gay-bashers, and my closest friend in the world, Marvin Feldman, died at his parent's home in Providence, R.I. Like everyone I knew, my heart 

was filled with bitterness, fear and despair.

<P>A few months after Marvin's death, Durant and I made the first two panels 

of what would become the NAMES Project AIDS Memorial Quilt. Joseph's panel was 

created to honor Ed Mock, a very talented African American choreographer. Mine 

was for Marvin. There was something about the process of creating the panels 

that was comforting. We shared memories of the two men as we worked and tried 

to imagine what they would have accomplished if they had lived. For the first 

time since Marvin died, I was able to think and talk about him without 

unbearable pain.

<P>I realized then the power of the Quilt, not only as a memorial but as a 

call to action, a weapon against AIDS and the parallel epidemic of hysteria, 

bigotry and hate which it had unleashed.

<P>As an organizer, I saw the Quilt primarily as a useful vehicle, tangible 

evidence of the suffering behind the statistics. Something with which to shame 

the politicians and capture the media's attention. I thought it was a good 

idea, but nothing prepared me for the artistry of the Quilt, nor for its 

spiritual power. And nothing could possibly have prepared our small group of 

volunteers on Castro Street for the response from across the world when the 

Quilt was first displayed in Washington, D.C., on Oct. 11, 1987.

<P>Today, those early Quilt panels from San Francisco have been joined to more 

than 50,000 panels from every state in the United States, containing more than 

80,000 names. Independent Quilt projects have been started in Canada, Mexico, 

Australia, South America, Europe, Asia and Africa. While the growth of the U.S. Quilt has been slowed by the development of the new AIDS drugs, the NAMES 

Project continues to receive new panels every month.

<P>The offices of the NAMES Project have relocated to Atlanta but the Quilt 

will always be remembered as gift from the people of San Francisco. A gift 

offered freely to the world from a city and a community which, while 

devastated by incalculable loss, created out of hatred, fear and despair an 

enduring symbol of love, courage and hope.
