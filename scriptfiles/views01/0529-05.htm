THIS WEEK, President Bush is making his first visit to California at a 

time when consumers have been socked with hefty electric rate increases, and 

$70 million is being drained from our state budget each day as we buy 

wholesale energy at outrageous prices.

<P>If Bush were serious about helping Californians, he would immediately tell 

the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, FERC, to do its job. FERC's legal 

mandate is to ensure that wholesale electricity prices are "just and 

reasonable." But current wholesale prices are not just and reasonable, and 

they are completely divorced from costs.

<P>FERC has been ideologically fixated on the free market while ignoring the 

reality that companies controlling California's energy supply are manipulating 

the market to make obscenely high profits at our expense.

<P>During the past several months, the news media have unveiled how generators 

are turning power plants on and off as often as several times an hour; taking 

plants off line for "unscheduled maintenance," and simply refusing to sell 

California power. Investigators have determined that these energy companies 

have deliberately gouged consumers to the tune of billions of dollars.

<P>State Senate figures show that profits of these energy companies rose more 

500 percent between 1999 and 2000.

<P>If President Bush wanted FERC to control wholesale prices through a system 

of cost-plus pricing, it would happen overnight.

<P>When it comes to long-term solutions, Bush's energy policy dangerously 

promotes a continued reliance on polluting fossil fuels and a resurgence of 

unsafe nuclear energy. Bush pays lip service to smart, sustainable solutions 

such as solar, wind and other sources of renewable energy, and to energy 

savings derived from conservation and improved efficiency.

<P>Technologies proven to be dirty, dangerous and expensive will get the 

lion's share of taxpayer subsidies, while the 2002 federal budget slashes 

funding for solar research by more than 50 percent, with major cuts in funding 

for geothermal, hydrogen and biomass technology, and fuel cell research.

<P>If the Bush administration were to make sustainable energy sources a 

priority, technologies such as wind, solar and some types of biomass could 

solve our long-term energy needs. While such a policy is anathema to oil, coal 

and utility industry leaders, it is central to any forward-looking energy 

strategy.

<P>The sensible responses to the energy crisis are clear: Control prices now 

and rely on renewable energy and conservation in the future.

<P>It is up to us to let the president know he can't kowtow to the energy 

industry interests. Hopefully, he'll respond to the angry Californians he will 

hear this week.
