For most people in the United States, the picture of events since 

Sept. 11 has been largely framed by television. When pollsters with 

Princeton Survey Research asked "Where have you gotten most of your news 

about the attacks?" more than a week later, a whopping 87 percent of adults 

gave TV as the answer.



<p>While newscasts are still apt to be disturbing, television is 

mostly back to normal. Some commercials pay respect to patriotic themes, 

and Old Glory continues to get a lot of screen time. But an ultimate 

expression of media normalcy -- the relentless barrage of TV ads -- 

returned to full strength after a mid-September hiatus of several days. The 

one-two punch of mind-numbing commercials and checked-out entertainment has 

never packed more of a wallop than it does now.



<p>Overall, the media disconnect is pretty extreme: Journalists and a 

range of commentators have told us that our world changed profoundly and 

irreversibly on Sept. 11. Yet the vast majority of what's on television is 

in the same old groove.



<p>In our society, the one-track momentum of commercialism has so 

much velocity that even horrific events don't slow it down for very long. 

The corporate-driven locomotives of consumerism keep barreling ahead. Like 

the cloying MasterCard commercial with its endless variations, the messages 

are slyly contradictory: There are precious things that money can't buy. 

So, to fully avail yourself of those precious things, be sure to buy buy buy.



<p>President Bush has stressed that Americans shouldn't fail to shop, 

as if pulling out credit cards is a defiant blow against "the evildoers." 

Thousands of TV commercials go on their merry way, oblivious to dire 

circumstances outside the calculus of huckstering.



<p>The sensuous imagery of a current Jaguar ad includes a man and 

woman kissing as the word "wicked" flickers through sultry jump-cuts. 

Flashing snippets seem to imitate the Orson Wells film "Touch of Evil" -- 

all in the service of selling a high-priced car, marketed for prestige and 

sublimation.



<p>Such commercials are merely business as usual, but at a time of 

extraordinary crisis -- when the yearning for straight talk and human 

connection is especially acute -- the customary TV onslaughts ring more 

hollow than ever. And while advertisers can't stop treating the public like 

gullible children, top government officials can't resist using the rhetoric 

of idealism to paper over the huge gaps between pretension and policy.



<p>The president tells us that the tragic events compel us to engage 

with our deeper values, that we should hug our kids, actively treasure our 

loved ones. On TV news, we see the Pentagon's grainy computerized-video 

abstractions of a far-off war on Afghanistan. Tiny blips and pixels 

represent Afghan individuals who -- with no more links to Osama bin Laden 

than you or I -- hugged their loved ones and watched them die.



<p>This country's fabled "exceptionalism" -- aided by the buffers of 

huge oceans, massive economic clout and military prowess -- has involved 

the wishful belief that to be an American is to be exempt from some basic 

human vulnerabilities. We're encouraged to assume that the United States 

can keep speeding through history without really looking at grim 

consequences for some other people on the planet. But they, too, want to 

hug their children; they too want to provide their loved ones with a safe 

future; they too experience rage that springs from grief and fear.



<p>Particularly in times of crisis, our mass-mediated democracy makes 

us part of a swift marketing loop: The media spin is intense; opinion polls 

gauge its effects; the polling results are grist for further media spin. 

Among the American public, we're told triumphantly, the president's 

favorable ratings -- like the approval numbers for the war -- are very 

high. Television has served the White House well.



<p>To credulously watch TV is to submit to a numbing process. What 

television offers today, perhaps more than ever, is anesthesia in the face 

of apprehension. As a stunned spectator, the body politic is incessantly 

coached as to the implicit limits of sensitivity -- the innocent lives at 

home are clearly precious, the innocent lives in Afghanistan nearly 

worthless. With impressive high-tech visuals, the TV set offers us 

expansive zones of unreality, swaddled in the comforts of commerce, 

hermetic entertainment and propaganda. If we must watch, it's essential 

that we recognize what we're seeing.
