ISLAMABAD, Oct 19 (IPS) - Addressing the American people on Oct.  

11, U.S. 

President George W Bush seemed as perplexed as millions of  

Americans about 

the ''vitriolic hatred for America in some Islamic countries''. He  

added: 

''Like most Americans, I just cannot believe it because I know how  

good we 

are.'' <P>

   The day after Bush's remarks, Pakistan, Nigeria, Indonesia,  

Egypt and 

Palestine witnessed more violent anti-American protests. What  

accounts for 

this dichotomy between the American self-image and how others,  

particularly 

Muslims, view them? 

<P>

   For any foreign visitor to America, the goodness of the average 

American, and the fact that immigrants rightly perceive America as 

providing opportunities and freedoms denied at home is certainly  

an 

important ingredient that makes the United States the world's most  

popular 

destination. Their deeply ingrained empathy, candor, humor and  

hard work 

endear Americans to all those who interact with them.  

<P>

   How is this 'good guy' transformed into the 'bad guy' abroad?  

The 

problem is that American goodness is hardly ever exported,  

remaining 

confined to its shores. This gap between what American says at  

home - 

liberties, rule of law and democracy - is rarely practiced in  

American 

foreign policy. 

<P>

    After all, what was common among a diverse group of leaders  

like Mao 

Zedong, Ho Chi Minh, Gamal Abdel Nasser, Fidel Castro or Dr  

Sukarno?  <P>

   They were all great admirers of America and the American  

Revolution 

prior to assuming office. They all looked up to the United States  

of 

America, whose 20th century role and ideology had been defined by  

Woodrow 

Wilson as supporting the 'right of self-determination' of  

subjugated 

peoples and colonies. <P>

   An enterprising American journalist, Edgar Snow, whose  

sympathetic 

account of the Chinese Communist Party's struggle, 'Red Star over  

China', 

remains a classic, launched Mao on the international stage.  <P>

   When Ho Chi Minh declared Vietnam's independence from France on  

Sep. 2, 

1945, he borrowed the opening words from the American Declaration  

of 

Independence regarding the ''inalienable right of people to life,  

liberty 

and the pursuit of happiness'', so inspired was he by American  

ideals. <P>

   Before the July 1952 overthrow of the Egyptian monarchy which  

he and 12 

other members of the Free Officers Movement initiated, Nasser was  

very 

close to the Americans, including the Middle East chief of the  

Central 

Intelligence Agency (CIA) of that period, Kermit Roosevelt, who  

was 

covertly communicating with Nasser through Anwar Sadat.   

<P>

   Sukarno idolized Thomas Jefferson and his speeches were laced  

with 

Jeffersonian quotes. And when Castro launched the Cuban  

Revolution, he was 

confident of receiving American support. 

<P>

   But then, what happened? After coming to power, they became  

implacable 

American foes after a rude shock that the America they admired and  

idolized 

and the one they had read about in history books was different in  

real life.  

<P>

   Then there were two events which were to prove a forerunner of  

the 

emerging patterns of American policy: the first successful CIA  

coup against 

a popular, democratic government because it was perceived to be  

acting 

contrary to U.S. economic interests, DR Mossadeq in Iran in 1953.  

<P>

   A decade later, the CIA engineered the ouster and assassination  

of South 

Vietnam's President Ngo Dinh Diem, a friend and ally of the United  

States 

simply because he had outlived his utility to American interests.  

<P>

   From ousting an elected nationalist to killing a friend, the  

U.S. 

persona was now being defined as an amoral, ruthless power whose  

foreign 

policy instruments were capable of anything, irrespective of  

friend or foe. 

It was perhaps in this context that DR Henry Kissinger once  

remarked, ''to 

be an enemy of America can be dangerous, but to be a friend is  

fatal.'' 

<P>

   Negativism about America has largely been derived and shaped by 

predominant popular perceptions in three areas: dignity, double  

standards 

and democracy. <P>

   The leading London-based Saudi-owned Arabic newspaper, 'Al  

Hayat', 

recently carried a poet's lament on the plight of the Arabs that  

includes 

lines such as ''Children are dying, but no one makes a move.  

Houses are 

demolished, but no one makes a move. Holy Places are desecrated,  

but no one 

makes a move. 

I am fed up with life in the world of mortals.'' <P>

   The author of these lines is not some raving radical in a  

Palestinian 

refugee camp, but Saudi Arabia's ambassador to Britain, and the  

sentiments 

he has expressed represent what is by now almost a universally- 

held belief 

among Arabs, the poor and the elite alike.  

<P>

   For Muslims, the double standards they see reinforced this  

hostility. 

For instance, when United Nations resolutions apply to Iraq, they  

exempt 

Israel. And nuclear weapons are even given religious labels, such  

as 

Pakistan's 'Islamic' bomb. Or terrorism is treated as a virtual  

Muslim 

monopoly, forgetting that Timothy McVeigh, DR Baruch Goldstein  

(the Jewish 

settler who gunned down 29 worshippers in a Palestinian mosque in  

1994) and 

the Tamil Tigers, who blew up Rajiv Gandhi, were not Muslim.  

<P>

    Democracy, or its absence in countries that are American  

allies, is 

another key ingredient of anti-Americanism, more so when the  

United States 

has conspired or connived to undermine the democratic process. <P>

   Patrice Lumumba was ousted in 1960 in the Congo and replaced by  

General 

Mobuto. In 1965, Sukarno's replacement by General Suharto was  

followed by a 

massacre of almost 500,000 Indonesians, some of whose names were  

in lists 

proved by the American Embassy to Suharto's men. And in 1973, the  

elected 

leftist President of Chile, Salvador Allende, was ousted and  

killed in a 

CIA-backed military coup.  <P>

   It is no surprise that those peoples in these countries traced  

their 

plight at home - the injustice, the police state repression, the  

poverty, 

and the corruption - to American actions.  <P>

  However, not many Americans were aware of the adverse impact of  

American 

foreign policy on billions of lives overseas. <P>

   All that changed on Sep.11, 2001. Nineteen suicide bombers have  

done 

more damage to America's self-confidence than World War II,  

Vietnam or the 

Cold War combined. On Oct. 7, after returning from bombing  

Afghanistan that 

Sunday night, Commander Biff, head of an F-14 Tomcat squadron,  

told the 

media: ''Tonight was about restoring America's confidence.''  <P>

   However, restoring America's confidence must not be at the  

expense of 

renewing America's relationship with the Muslim world, which is  

facing 

severe strains. Hence, the crisis needs to be handled with  

patience, 

maturity and wisdom. <P>

   Of all the hordes of Western journalists who have been in  

Pakistan after 

Sep. 11, not one has reported any hostility or harassment from the  

people 

they encounter in the streets, even those in anti-American  

demonstrations.  <P>

   There is no personal animosity toward any American or Westerner  

from 

people they have met, only a strident political critique and  

resentment of 

American foreign policy, which is where the roots of anti- 

Americanism lie. </p>
