Following the devastating attacks in New York and Washington, it is appropriate to pause and take stock.

<P>America's political right, most of whose spokesmen are well beyond draft age, already is barking loudly about retaliation. Retaliation against whom? We actually hear talk of declaring war following a second Pearl Harbor. War against whom? Neither question seems even to matter for these folks. Just do something, and make it bloody.
<P>The chest-thumping of those who regularly defend Israel's worst excesses against human rights in the West Bank &#151; and it is assumed by many that these events relate to that conflict &#151; seems almost to reflect eagerness for America to be thrust into the Israeli mode of operation.

<P> Well, we know how successful those policies have been for Israel. She generates a new cohort of bitter enemies every generation.  </P>
<P> The yet dimly-understood events in New York and Washington do offer a few hard lessons even now.</P>
<P> The United States, with its vast geographical extent and dependence on a complex sprawl of infrastructure, is utterly vulnerable to determined enemies, especially those willing to lay down their lives.</P>
<P> Aircraft carriers and police with machine guns cannot alter this fact. Neither can the new wave of fear-mongering which one suspects is coming. After all, there were people in Washington virtually ready to suspend parts of our Constitution following the crash of TWA Flight 800, which proved an accident, and a small bomb in Atlanta, likely the work of an anti-abortion fanatic. </P>
<P> These perpetrators were skilled and determined. They included people capable of flying an airliner and motivated enough to fly it into a wall. They succeeded in an elaborate, well-planned scheme without anyone detecting them. </P>
<P> There is no proof that Osama bin Laden was involved. A scholar who knows a good deal about him has said it is doubtful he even has the requisite management skill. </P>
<P>  WE HAVE never been given sound evidence that bin Laden is guilty of anything but hating the United States. That doesn't stop our press from talking him up as master terrorist constantly stalking the country. Within hours of the hijackings, his name was rolling off the lips of American officials, demonstrating knowledge they do not posses.</P>
<P> Americans &#151; a people who lose patience over a late pizza delivery &#151; like quick solutions to their problems. And they like their problems reduced to easily understood forces of good and evil. Milton's Satan vs. God. Cowboys and Indians. </P>
<P> But terrorism vs. democracy, with apologies to President Bush, is not a helpful way of understanding recent events &#151; even if they do prove related to the Middle East. Indeed, this way of thinking is at the very heart of policies which create enemies willing to suffer kamikaze deaths. </P>
<P> The poor job of U.S. intelligence in detecting this scheme should surprise no one. As Sen. Daniel Moynihan and others have repeatedly observed, despite monstrous expenditures, the CIA was almost never right about the Soviet Union, right down to its last days. And with the way guerilla or resistance groups typically organize, they are even less amenable to this kind of intelligence. </P>
<P> Israel's success with regional intelligence has a lot to do with having people who so closely resemble their enemies that they can infiltrate in large numbers. Willingness to use torture has also contributed. The very fact that Israel was unaware of this scheme is evidence that Palestinian groups were not involved. </P>
<P> The world's recent spate of terrorist acts almost certainly are after-tremors of past American foreign policy. The Afghan fighters that the CIA trained and equipped as a fierce irritant to Russia are now scattered across much of the Middle East. </P>
<P> THERE IS every reason to believe that such tough, dedicated people no more accept Israel's treatment of Palestinians than they accepted Russia's treatment of Afghanistan. But a change in their focus, from killing Russians to killing Americans, instantly turns them from heroic fighters to unspeakable terrorists. </P>
<P> Just maybe, there is something to be learned from these terrible events that will enable us to conduct foreign policy in a better-informed and more even-handed way. Just maybe, before we launch a new batch of automated killing machines (cruise missiles) to kill still more innocent people. </P>
