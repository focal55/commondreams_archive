AS PROTESTS go, this one wasn't exactly up there with the 1963 civil rights

march on Washington. No one will ever call it a tide-turner. In fact, on the

busy streets of Manhattan, the whole thing almost went without notice.

<P>

    That's a pity, because at the bottom millions of lives are at stake-most of

them black.

<P>

    The story goes like this: On Monday, maybe 170 people gathered in a sleet

storm to shout hostile slogans outside the midtown offices of two

pharmaceutical juggernauts-Bristol-Myers Squibb and GlaxoSmithKline. The

demonstrators are furious with the companies for participating in a lawsuit

against South Africa.

<P>

    Who can blame them?

    It seems that in 1997, South African President Nelson Mandela had the

audacity to sign into law a measure that would let his nation import cheap,

generic, life-prolonging, HIV-fighting medications from countries such as

Brazil and India.

<P>

    The big companies-stupidly-went ballistic. And now, in a case that opened

Monday in Pretoria, 39 pharmaceutical companies want to overturn the law on the

grounds that it is unconstitutional.

<P>

    This statute was not some cheesy third-world scam meant only to evade

treaties and cheat the major players in the global pharmaceutical game. It was

not some populist ripoff meant to hijack the intellectual property of companies

that had spent years developing and patenting HIV drugs.

<P>

    For South Africa, it was a matter of survival.

<P>

    Look. A competent regime of HIV medicine runs between $10,000 and $15,000

annually in the United States. But unemployment in South Africa is around 30

percent. The average income weighs in at around $3,000 a year. Meanwhile, up to

20 percent of the nation's population between the ages of 15 and 49 is

HIV-infected. An average of 200 infected babies are born in the country daily.

<P>

    The demand for treatment is gigantic. Money is scarce. Lives are on the

line. And generic makers are offering drug regimens for $350 to $1,000 a year.

<P>

Who on earth wouldn't go for that deal?

    As for the law, World Trade Organization rules let nations in emergency

straits ignore patents and use generics under certain conditions. And the

United States has promised it won't seek trade sanctions against African

countries that take this course. Does anyone want to argue that trade rules are

more important than lives?

    It's conceivable that 39 drug firms do.

<P>

    And here's the amazing part: They are pushing this case even

though-according to the activist group Act Up-all of Africa accounts for just

1.3 percent of the global pharmaceutical market.

<P>

    If the majors don't want Africa to use generics to treat its population of

26 million HIV-infected people, what solution do they have in mind? They don't

want to risk becoming bigger villains than the tobacco companies, do they?

    I don't think they do. For one thing, many of them have already agreed to

price cuts on some AIDS-related drugs. There's just one hitch: They tend to tie

strings to their offers. And for now, every company is negotiating a separate

deal on every drug in every country. The process is slow and cumbersome and

piecemeal and frustrating.

<P>

    Let us be honest about this: AIDS will explode into an African holocaust

very soon. If the situation is miserable now, it could be unthinkable in the

future. This is no time for governments foolishly to try to pretend that

nothing is wrong. And it is no time for drug companies to penalize millions of

sick and dying souls to protect imaginary interests.

<P>

    If the companies are afraid that the appetite for bootleg generics will

spread to rich nations, then the United States and other governments must show

them that they won't let that happen. The world needs these companies to remain

healthy so that they can press ahead with their research projects-such as the

hunt for an AIDS vaccine.

<P>

    Let's be honest about something else: Even if the world can figure out how

to distribute HIV drugs where they're needed, this will not solve the AIDS

crisis. The New York Times Magazine got it incredibly wrong on Jan. 28, when it

ran a cover story on HIV drug distribution titled "How to Solve the World's

AIDS Crisis." The current drugs can only prolong lives in most cases. They

don't save them.

<P>

    And let's be honest about one other thing: Most of the world is blase about

this issue now. As the protesters marched through midtown on Monday, the cops

were great, the doormen were friendly and nobody seemed particularly steamed

up.

<P>

    But just wait until the tidal wave of death hits. It is on the way-and

fingers will be pointed.
