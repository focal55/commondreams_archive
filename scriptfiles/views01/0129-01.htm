The conservative complaint that the news media are tainted with liberal

bias reached a new crescendo during the contentious presidential campaign.

Republican partisans were in full throat denouncing what they considered media

favoritism toward Vice President Al Gore.

<P>

   The mainstream media have long been the whipping boy of the ideological

fringes, but in recent years the right wing has taken the lead in the

denunciation derby.

<P>



   Although there was some criticism of how the media ignored blacks' voting

complaints in Florida, by and large, media criticism from the left seldom

makes much news these days. And that's odd. The left's critique that media are

too devoted to the logic of the marketplace seems more in tune with the tenor

of the times, given the increasing consolidation of media under fewer and

fewer corporate controllers.

<P>

   But instead of complaining about the narrowing range of journalistic

sources, or about the relentless demand for profitable product at the expense

of quality journalism, conservatives are busy whining about the "liberal

media." This seems a bit out of step with reality; how could one characterize

colossal media corporations like Time-Warner AOL, Viacom or even the Tribune

Co., as liberal with a straight face?

<P>

   Many analysts on the left ridicule this conservative fixation on media

liberalism as simpleminded demagoguery. And to be sure, there is that.

<P>

   But I believe that conservatives are on to something a bit more

fundamental. In fact, the right is right when it condemns American journalism

as liberal; liberalism and journalism have much in common, or at least they

should have. The chief quality of liberalism is a skeptical attitude toward

all received wisdom, be it sacred or secular. This is not driven by any

particular antipathy to tradition. But rather, because all received wisdom

comes with biased assumptions, and society can only evaluate those biases by

examining them.

<P>

   Liberals understand that one person's panacea could well be another's

plague and that truth is proximate; it all depends on the context. This also

is something journalists discover after listening to equally convincing

partisans on various sides of an issue.

<P>

   Notions of proximate truth are odious to conservatives, however,

particularly those with fundamentalist religious beliefs. They condemn

liberals as moral relativists who waffle on clear issues of right and wrong.

They are certain and liberals are agnostic. This is also the basis of their

critique of the news media. Conservatives want journalists to abandon their

stance of relativity and walk in the light of moral certainty.

<P>

   But in order to bring impartial scrutiny to various sides of a story,

journalists must also be agnostic. Skepticism of all doctrinal claims allows

journalists to probe deeply into an issue without the fear of undermining

their own value system.

<P>

   But it is this very freedom from dogma that makes journalists suspicious to

conservative true believers. Since the pendulum has swung right in recent

years, conservative media fare is also popular. Thus, the flagrantly

right-leaning Fox News Channel is the fastest growing cable news station.

Since high ratings spawn imitation, we're likely to see other stations offer

their own versions of right-wing populism.

<P>

   That would be a huge mistake. Despite its limitations, U.S. journalism

still offers an opportunity to bring some clarity to the social problems that

continue to cloud our country's future.

<P>

   Even with the growth of corporate media, the need for a journalist vehicle

to facilitate civil discourse will grow as the nation grows increasingly

diverse. In that regard, the news media must reinforce its liberal

sensibilities, despite market pressures to follow the current leader to the

right.

<P>

   In addition to that, news shops have to step up their efforts to add more

diversity to their ranks, despite recent court rulings releasing television

and radio stations from affirmative-action requirements. What's more, the

print media must accelerate efforts resolved in 1978 by the American Society

of Newspaper Editors to make the composition of newsrooms resemble the

country's ethnic profile in 20 years. After failing to reach that goal, SANE

simply gave itself another 20-year deadline. But growing opposition to

affirmative-action programs is crippling many efforts to recruit minority

candidates into media jobs.

<P>

   The next time you hear some knee-jerk complaint about the liberal media,

please concur. But also remind the complainer that our nation's future depends

on it.
