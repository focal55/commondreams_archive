I just received a letter from a friend who lives in New York City.  He wrote 

that he fears for the future after the September 11 terrorist attacks there 

and at the Pentagon.  In Sacramento, I share his emotion.



<p>September 11 has left many people in a state of anxiety.  Understanding the 

centrality of this condition is crucial.  Here’s why.



<p>The desire for safety is a natural condition of human beings.  This is their 

true interest.  When safety is absent, people seek its return in many ways.



<p>As I see it, the question is how to restore a sense of safety.  I say a 

“sense” because absolute safety is absolutely illusory.  This truism bears 

attention precisely because of the recent monumental event that ended life 

for innocent people of all backgrounds on American soil.



<p>This crime against humanity has created a void.  It’s been said that nature 

abhors a void.  Confronting it, we do well to see that in our interrelated 

world, every action causes a reaction.



<p>No people stand outside this equation.  Innocent victims of violence share a 

bitter fate.  Accepting this fact is part of the healing process.



<p>One other thing is certain.  We can count on unforeseen outcomes of our 

government’s responses to Sept.  11.  Its militarized policies of the past 

offer a guide to future militarism at home and abroad.



<p>Consider America’s “War on Drugs.”  Has it made anybody safer from the 

violence associated with the illegal drug trade?  Instead, what this war has 

done is incarcerate mostly nonwhite Americans whose labor is unneeded on the 

job market.  The economics of America's skin color relations are nothing 

nice.



<p>Did the U.S.-led Gulf War against Iraq bring peace in the Middle East?  On a 

related note for us now, President Bush’s father did build some “national 

unity” for this war.  This was one example of a political leader 

manufacturing public consent for an international butchery.  It continues 

today, though less visibly, with the economic sanctioning of Iraq causing 

the deaths of more than 500,000 Iraqi kids.



<p>Many Americans, in their grief and shock after September 11, want something 

to be done to make them safe.  Who can argue?  Our idea of safety has been 

violated in the most horrific way, and we are hurting.



<p>In every end there is a new beginning.  Which means many things.  One is 

that during emotional times of loss, people are vulnerable.  Political 

leaders and mainstream news media owners skillfully exploit this emotion to 

consolidate their power over the public mind.



<p>Not that politicians need the excuse of a crisis to weaken our freedom.  

Recall that President Clinton, during the so-called “economic boom,” backed 

the anti-terrorism and crime bills, major rollbacks of civil rights that 

weakened habeas corpus.  In a global economic downturn currently flowing 

from the U.S., President Bush and his administration are trying to build on 

this repressive legislation under the guise of promoting public safety.



<p>To be sure, fear of the future can paralyze some into silence.  For them, 

the unacceptable could become acceptable.  Elites’ solutions to the current 

crisis are meant to cow people into embracing measures that will make a bad 

situation worse.  To paraphrase Audre Lorde, their silence offers them no 

protection.



<p>For other people, fear can vitalize them into new ways of thinking.  Never 

underestimate the ability of ordinary folks to mobilize and organize in ways 

that encourage the best in themselves and others.  I mean the qualities of 

sympathy and solidarity that have stood history’s test of adversity.



<p>Now is the time for Americans to turn our collective fear of being unsafe 

into an opportunity for renewal.  The future doesn’t have to be one of 

conflict resolution through violent confrontation.  Solutions based on 

nonviolent cooperation are emerging, however underreported in America’s 

mainstream news media, in the U.S. and around the world.



<p>In the end, the solutions to social problems will have to come from 

humanity's majority if society is to survive.  It’s the hour for us to teach 

our leaders by example.  They have many lessons to learn.
