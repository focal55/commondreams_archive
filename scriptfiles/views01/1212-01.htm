The bombing of Afghanistan by the United States is being reported in the

press as "The War Against Terrorism". That war was never initiated by

ordinary Afghans whom we are reportedly saving from terrorism (and yes,

they are certainly the victims of Taliban and Mujahadeen terrorism).

Even

American citizens were not included via their congressional

representatives, to decide if the US should initiate a war in

Afghanistan.

It was an executive decision, made with only the justification that it

was

a War Against Evil, a War Against Terrorism. Let's call it what it is,

not

a War Against Terrorism, but a War Against Afghans.



<p>Let me explain why this is a more appropriate title. More and more

reports

are coming out each day about "errant" bombs destroying whole villages

full of Afghans. As early as October 22nd, reports of US bombing whole

villages, were surfacing. Human Rights Watch reported that the village

of

Chowkar Karez, 40 km north of Kandhahar was bombed at night by US

planes.

According to that report, "Many of the people in the village ...  ran

out

of their homes, afraid that the bombs would fall on the homes. All

witnesses stated that aircraft then returned to the area and began

firing

from guns." - they were bombed and then gunned down.



<p>When asked to respond to this report, the Pentagon spokesperson said on

November 2nd, "The people there are dead because we wanted them dead".

These people had nothing to do with the Taliban or Al Qaeda - the ruins

of

the leveled village revealed nothing of military value. This pattern

continues with the one difference - Pentagon officials have taken to

completely denying the existence of Afghan civilians.



<p>The British media recently published an eye witness report of the

village

of Kama Ado being destroyed by US bombs in which at least 40 people were

killed. When asked to respond, a Pentagon spokesperson vehemently said

it

simply didn't happen. He said "Nothing Happened" - those were the exact

words (The Independent). We are told "nothing happened" when evidence of

the war's real victims is presented. Afghan civilians do not even have

the

distinction of being called co-lateral damage anymore - they are now

non-existent, simply standing in the way of our war.



<p>On December 5th we heard - once more in the British press - "For the

fourth consecutive night, American warplanes targeting al-Qa'ida

fighters

in the White Mountains also bombed nearby villages, killing and injuring

unknown numbers and forcing thousands to flee to the regional capital,

Jalalabad." (The Independent). There is not enough room to details all

the

reports of Afghan deaths from bombs here. And you can be sure that we do

not hear about all of them given the restrictions on the press in

Afghanistan.



<p>Every day thousands are forced to leave their homes in at least three

major cities:  Kabul, Jalalabad and Kandhahar, and become refugees for

fear of their lives. A refugee who left Kandahar said of the victims of

US

bombing: "There are a lot of casualties, they are martyrs, and they are

mostly civilians," (Christian Science Monitor). If the West can claim

responsibility for the joy of the citizens liberated from the Taliban in

Kabul, then it must also admit responsibility for the misery of the

civilians fleeing the bombs into dismal refugee camps in southern

Afghanistan.



<p>One American government adviser, Richard Perle, said of US

responsibility

"I don't think any outside power has a responsibility in Afghanistan.

People have to take responsibility for their own destiny" - as though

the

people whose villages had been leveled should have known better, anyway,

than to live in downtown Kandahar or Jalalabad or Kama Ado or Chowkar

Karez. Would we have held those who were killed in the World Trade

Center

responsible for their fates? Of course not. Then why are Afghans

responsible for the bombs dropping on them, for the starvation inflicted

on them?



<p>Global Exchange's Medea Benjamin reported back from her recent trip to

Afghanistan and Pakistan: "Everywhere we went, both in Afghanistan and

in

the external refugee camps, we met people who lost loved ones or were

injured by US bombs... Little is known about the actual numbers of

innocent civilians killed. The US says the casualties are few.  Afghans

we

spoke with said there are probably thousands of dead."



<p>Sadly, this War Against Afghans is very much in line with the US's

historical role in Afghanistan. In the 1970s, the US hired seven

different

political parties of fundamentalist men called Mujahadeen. These were

extremists hired by the CIA during the Cold War, to "draw the Soviet's

into the Afghan trap" as expressed by former National Security Advisor

for

Carter, Zbignew Brzezinsky. The CIA empowered the mujahadeen, many of

whom

now comprise the Northern Alliance, with billions of dollars of weapons,

including American made Stinger missiles, knowing well their

fundamentalist and misogynist nature.  Using these weapons and

sophisticated training in the art of terror, these men successfully

drove

out the Soviets, but also waged a terrible war on their own people.

Their

fight for power over Afghanistan initiated a blood bath in the early

1990s

before the Taliban took over, during the so-called Civil War. 45,000

innocent Afghans were killed in Kabul alone between 1992-1996, by men

who

now comprise the Northern Alliance, with guns and training bought and

paid

for by the United States.  I think President Bush said it best: "If you

feed a terrorist or fund a terrorist, you're a terrorist" (The

Guardian).



<p>The pursuit of destruction in Afghanistan continues with the bombing

campaign. There are reports of the US intention to invade Afghanistan

months before September 11th 2001. The CIA had been in Afghanistan for

three years before Sept 11th as reported by the New York Times. As BBC

reported on September 18th, Niaz Naik, a former Pakistani Foreign

Secretary, was told by senior American officials in mid-July "that

military action against Afghanistan would go ahead by the middle of

October". For ordinary Afghans, the bombing campaign was the worst thing

that could have happened.



<p>On the one hand they were living under the most fundamentalist regime in

recent history, who were legalizing their oppression especially for

women,

not to mention the hideous accompanying disasters such as landmine

infestation, eradication of agriculture, a terrible drought, a

destruction

of infrastructure from previous wars, and the largest refugee population

in the world. And now on the other hand, they have to contend with the

most powerful country in the world waging a war against them.



<p>But the War Against Afghans has an additional dimension to accompany the

bombing from above: starvation from below. Several weeks ago,

international humanitarian organizations such as Oxfam International

made

a public plea to the United States to pause the bombing in order to

allow

food supplies to be taken into Afghanistan while winter drew ever

closer.

UNICEF had estimated that an additional 100,000 Afghan children would

die

of starvation and cold this winter because of the effects of the

bombing.

The response of the US government was stubborn refusal to let little

things like civilian deaths come in the way of their "War on Terrorism".

Soon afterward, Red Cross warehouses storing food and other supplies

were

"inadvertently" bombed, not once but twice, a week apart. Twice.



<p>When five countries (including Britain and Canada) recently offered to

send multinational troops to Afghanistan to provide security to ensure

the

delivery of humanitarian aid to Afghans, the only thing that stood in

their way was the US government. Not Taliban, not the Northern Alliance,

but the US government who claims that these troops could interefere in

their military campaign in Afghanistan. It seems that Afghans and their

rumbling empty bellies are too much of a nuisance in our War Against

Terrorism. Instead of at least providing the troops needed themselves,

the

US unbelievably declared that it would not provide security and not

allow

anyone else to do so either. So there is now food and other aid on the

ground but the US is ensuring that it doesn't reach Afghans - some how

feeding innocent hungry people interferes with our efforts to target

terrorism.



<p>Conclusion: the military operation which we are told is saving Afghans

from the Taliban, is more important than saving Afghans. One of the

leaflets being scattered over Afghanistan by the United States, says "We

do not want to take over your nation;  we want to give it back to its

rightful owners, the people of Afghanistan." Am I the only one who sees

the gruesome hypocrisy of this operation? If deliberate starvation from

below and deadly bombings from above is not pure terror, I don't know

what

is.  Somehow this strategy will give back Afghans their nation.



<p>To add to the US War Against Afghans, Afghans are seeing a new terrible

stage of the conflict developing with the re-gaining of control by the

Northern Alliance. Having worked with the Revolutionary Association of

the

Women of Afghanistan (RAWA), I had the privelege of being educated about

the Afghan situation by people who experienced daily the realities of

fundamentalist dominated life. RAWA warns us consistently of the crimes

committed by those who now comprise the Northern Alliance, contrary to

what we read about in the US media. Human Rights Watch and Amnesty

International have detailed their crimes, especially in regard to

women's

rights (see HRW report "Crisis of Impunity"). In Northern Alliance

controlled territory, women had little access to education, little

access

to decent jobs, and were treated very similarly to women under the

Taliban

(New York Times). This is in addition to the earlier mentioned record of

tens of thousands of civilian murders during the civil war, which

accompanied rapes, and forced marriages which drove women to mass

suicide

and depression. Recently, the Northern Alliance prevented a march by

women

in Kabul, apparently because they couldn't provide security, a hollow

claim.



<p>Of 30 members of the cabinet of the new so-called government in

Afghanistan, which came out of closed-door talks in Bonn, Germany, 18

are

affiliated with the Northern Alliance, which bodes ill for democratic

forces in Afghanistan. How can a group responsible for death and

destruction, rape and women's oppression before, during and after the

civil war, espousing similar ideologies as the Taliban, be taken

seriously

as a step toward peace in Afghanistan? They simply joined forces to

fight

off the Taliban but are an ever-defecting set of men who

opportunistically

lust for power. Even now, while the whole world is watching them, they

are

resorting to power grabs, dividing up the country into slices and

encouraging lawlessness, looting and pillaging. Anuradha Chenoy said on

December 7th in the Times of India "If the terms of peace are written by

the very people who wrote the terms of war and who have been indicted

for

war crimes and gender abuse, then for many in Afghanistan, war will

continue under the cloak of an unjust peace". How ironic that the

Taliban

were initially welcomed in Afghanistan by the majority of the Afghan

people because they were seen as an alternative to these groups the UN

and

US are now presenting as leaders in a new Afghan government.



<p>The Northern Alliance representatives in Bonn may appear to be a highly

sophisticated set of men dressed smartly in dark suits and red ties. The

token women appear happy and smiling. In this war, they have all gotten

what they always wanted. Benjamin says, as part of her report back from

Afghanistan, "While it is a positive development that several women were

asked to participate in the Bonn talks on the transition government, the

women were selected by the male delegates in a completely undemocratic

fashion. We met many women who felt that several of the women delegates

were selected primarily due to family connections. Women's groups that

have been on the forefront of defending women's rights under the reign

of

the Taliban were not invited."



<p>Such groups include the women of RAWA who have had over 2 decades of

experience in community building, educating, organizing, who are

pro-democracy, pro-women's rights, and non-violent. There is no scarcity

of experienced, able women to help run the country. It is not that

ordinary Afghans are not ready for women to run the country - General

Suhaila Siddiqui who is heading the interim Dept of Public Health, is

being warmly received (despite her connections with the past Afghan

pro-Soviet government of Najibullah). She too is affiliated with the

Northern Alliance ofcourse.



<p>By any international definition, the men comprising the Northern

Alliance

are guilty of war crimes. Their illegitimacy in a majority

representation

in the delegation at Bonn makes a mockery of international law. Let us

not

forget that these negotiations happened in the context of the US's

active

bombing campaign. Ordinary Afghans suffer the consequences of the bombs

and deliberate starvation, while powerful Afghans with dirty pasts are

put

forward to represent their government. In fact, the chairman of this new

government, Hamad Karzai, was once working for the Mujahadeen and then

closely working with the Taliban before defecting back.



<p>There is little hope left for ordinary Afghans to regain their dignity

and

their nation. In a recent interview with a local channel, the reporter

asked me what the US should do to end the suffering of Afghans. My

response was "What has the US not done to ensure that Afghans suffer?"

His

retort, the standard one, was "well what was done was in the past. We

make

mistakes and it's no use crying over spilt milk, what can we do now?"



<p>If what's in the past does not deserve accountability, why are we

lamenting the fact that thousands of innocent Americans were killed in

terrorist attacks? Is that not in the past? Yes it is, but it is a

horrible crime that must be accounted for, whose perpetrators must be

brought to trial. By the same standards - and here I make the leap that

the same standards be applied to Americans as to others - the US's

crimes,

past and present, in Afghanistan, must be accounted for and addressed.



<p>What can we do about it now? Stunningly simple in it's logic but fully

within our power to do so: end the War Against Afghans. Stop bombing

them,

stop facitlitating their starvation, stop promoting criminals in the

interim government. Why is that so difficult?



<p>"Oh, but there will be a power vacuum now if the US just leaves", said

the

same reporter. Well, it was quite convenient that the US created a

situation where their bombs would be an adequate replacement for peace

and

democracy in Afghanistan. There is an alternative which groups like RAWA

have proposed for years and which has been completely ignored - the

intervention of a UN peace keeping force - one which will disarm all the

armed factions in Afghanistan and set the stage, as it did in East Timor

(no thanks to the US which was actively selling arms to Indonesia to

continue their massacres of Timorese) a few years ago. Afghans who are

not

armed, Afghan women and the elderly, freedom-loving Afghans, need to be

actively playing a role in rebuilding their country and lifting it from

the ashes of foreign sponsored destruction. They need the help of the

United Nations for that. But I'm being idealistic here, am I not?

Madeliene Albright said "we will act multi-laterally when we can, and

uni-laterally when we must". This reflects the US's position toward the

UN

and while we may harbor hopes of a UN-sponsored peace, it is not likely

they will play out because of the active efforts of the US to thwart

international law and UN legitimacy. There are solutions to ending this

conflict. They involve changing the very nature of US intervention and

engagement in the world. In the mean time, let's listen to what Afghans

are saying to us: On December 4th, Tribal and village leaders near

Jalalabad, in a signed declaration said "Our demand to the United States

Government and it's coalition: stop the bombing in the name of

humanity".

(New York Times).



<p>Let's end this War Against Afghans.
