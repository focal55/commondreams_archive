Every Jewish child learns the same Hanukkah story that I learned long

ago.&nbsp; When the land of Judah was occupied by a foreign emperor and

his army, a tiny band of courageous freedom-fighters resisted.&nbsp;

Though far outnumbered by the tyrant’s armies, they won a miraculous

victory for national liberation.&nbsp; 

<p>

As we light the candles in 2001, this story is irrelevant and

dangerous.&nbsp; It is time to find a new story for Hanukkah.

<p>

The old story assumes that, in every contest, the Jews are the weak and

vulnerable side.&nbsp; With its half a dozen victorious wars, Israel has

made this premise, and thus the whole story, irrelevant.&nbsp; If anyone

had any doubts, the events of recent months have proven that the idea of

the Jews as a tiny, beleaguered minority no longer holds true.&nbsp;

<p>

Israel now plays with the Palestinians the way a cat plays with a

cornered mouse.&nbsp; Beyond the dead and wounded (the ratio of

Palestinian to Israeli wounded in the last 14 months is about 30 to 1),

beyond the humiliations that every Palestinian has endured, there is the

constant uncertainty.&nbsp; When Palestinians are free to live their

daily lives with no Israeli checkpoints or tanks at the street corners,

they know that it is merely by Israel’s good graces.&nbsp; 

<p>

Even the slightest joys of ordinary life cannot be taken for

granted.&nbsp; The occupier can bring back the troops and tanks at any

moment.&nbsp; Everything is at the whim of the young menmany still really

boyswho wear the Star of David and carry the guns.&nbsp; 

<p>

The most public uncertainty and humiliation falls to the man who is the

ultimate mouse in the corner:&nbsp; Yassir Arafat.&nbsp; Unless he

prevents every single Palestinian from harming a single Israelian

obviously impossible taskhe is branded a supporter of terrorism.&nbsp;

When he makes efforts to stop the violence, imposing the police state

tactics that the Israelis demand, it naturally stirs resentment among

many Palestinian.&nbsp; Hamas and other groups opposed to Arafat get a

big political boost.&nbsp; Some pollsters claim those groups already are

more popular than Arafat.&nbsp; The outcome in the West Bank and Gaza is

unpredictable.&nbsp; 

<p>

But the outcome in Israel is perfectly predictable.&nbsp; No matter how

much Arafat dances to the Israeli tune, Sharon will condemn it as

insufficient (and the Bush administration will not demur).&nbsp;&nbsp;

Nothing Arafat can do will get him out of Israel’s clutches.&nbsp;

<p>

In the Israeli newspapers, some commentators explain that this was

Sharon’s plan from the day he became prime minister.&nbsp; Keep Arafat

twisting and turning.&nbsp; No matter which way he turns, squeeze him

until he bleeds, politically, so badly that he loses effective

control.&nbsp; But make him weaken Hamas so that it cannot get control

either.&nbsp; Keep all Palestinian leaders so feeble that none can lead

effective resistance to Israel’s occupation. 

<p>



For decades, Israeli policy has been guided by the principle of keeping

the opposition divided.&nbsp; There are many credible reports that Israel

built up Hamas precisely to divide the Palestinians politically.&nbsp;

Now, no matter which way the Palestinians turn politically, they will be

condemned and attacked by Israel.&nbsp; The cat will simply play with the

mouseuntil the mouse rolls over and abandons itself to permanent

domination.&nbsp; 

<p>

But most Jews cannot see the true power relationship.&nbsp; They repeat

the old Hanukkah story, insisting that they are still the vulnerable

mouse and the Palestinians the predatory cat.&nbsp; To most Jews (and

many non-Jewish Americans) the tactics of the Sharon government look like

just another Hanukkah:&nbsp; a tiny people bravely fighting back against

unjust efforts to dominate them.&nbsp; In that light, the continuing

occupation, the growing Jewish settlements in the West Bank, and&nbsp;

the tanks and gunship helicopters all seem morally justified.&nbsp;

<p>

The old Hanukkah story is dangerous, because it helps Israel perpetuate

an occupation that, anywhere else, would be branded a moral

outrage.&nbsp; The old story is dangerous because the longer the

occupation continues, the longer Israelis as well as Palestinians will

suffer and die.&nbsp; If this cat-and-mouse game is, in fact, Sharon’s

plan, he is sacrificing his own people to his political goals:&nbsp;

keeping Jewish settlements in Palestinian territory and preventing a

genuinely independent, fully sovereign Palestinian state.

<p>

If we want to help Israelis and Palestinians achieve lasting security, we

can tell a new story as we light the candles this Hanukkah.&nbsp; We can

tell a story about what happens whenever foreigners try to dominate

someone else’s land.&nbsp; 

<p>

In this story, the lesson is that resistance to occupation always

triumphs in the end.&nbsp; The occupying army was wasting its time.&nbsp;

All the bloodshed was in vain.&nbsp; The occupiers would have been far

wiser to withdraw gracefully.&nbsp; It was just common sense.&nbsp; They

could have saved so many lives on both sides.&nbsp; Because the

freedom-fighters would not give up, no matter how long the battle went

on.&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<p>

The word <i>hanukkah </i>means “a new dedication.”&nbsp; This year, how

about a new dedication, if not to peace with justice, than at least to

common sense?
