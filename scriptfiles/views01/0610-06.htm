SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico, 08 June 2001 - Robert Kennedy Jr., representing a

string of plaintiffs seeking to end U.S. Navy bombing practice in Vieques,

yesterday filed a petition with the U.S. First Circuit Court of Appeals in

Boston urgently seeking an injunction to halt a renewal of bombing slated

for 13 June, said today's edition of the Spanish-language daily

El Nuevo D'ia.



<p>The plaintiffs contend in the document filed with the appellate court that

the U.S. District Court in Puerto Rico has for eight months wrongly refused

to issue a preliminary injunction to halt the bombing. It asserts the lack

of action by the chief judge of the U.S. District Court in Puerto Rico,

Hector M. Laffitte, is a clear example that "justice delayed is not justice."



<p>In another denial reported today in a separate item in the same local Spanish-

language daily, the Pentagon denied yesterday that the U.S. Navy conducted

nude searches of protesters, or that it conducted searches of their body

cavities, as claimed by three Puerto Rico senators in their separate

individual testimony before the U.S. House Hispanic Caucus in Washington,

D.C., on Tuesday. The three senators, who were detained in separate groups by

law enforcement personnel in the Navy's Vieques restricted zone, are women.

One of them, Norma Burgos, is a former Puerto Rico secretary of state, and

currently the vice president of the pro-U.S. statehood New Progressive Party.



<p>In yet another denial, the currently hugely popular political analyst and

radio commentator Juan Manuel Garc'ia Passalacqua, a Harvard Law graduate

and adviser to the U.S. National Security Council during the four years of

the Jimmy Carter administration, claimed yesterday on his radio program that

Puerto Rico Governor Sila Mar'ia Calder'on is in a state of denial analogous

to that known to occur when a patient is first told she/he has been diagnosed

to have a terminal disease.



<p>Passalacqua asserted this was the conclusion he reached after pondering the

governor's response to a report that the Bush administration has accelerated

the deadline for a report on Puerto Rico's political status options in

response to the governor's decision to hold an independent local referendum

on a continuation of Vieques bombing.



<p>The governor's proposed referendum, known as "La Criolla," is to be held

29 July. It is understood that it would not be binding on the U.S. Navy, but

that it would formally express the will of the people. A separate referendum

previously planned and sanctioned by the federal government and the Navy is

scheduled for 06 November. The latter does not include an option that is to

be added in the governor's proposed referendum, which is an immediate halt

to the bombing.



<p>The governor's response to the report that the referendum she is setting

up for the end of July has triggered an accelerated deadline for the Bush

administration status report was, "I don't believe it!"



<p>Passalacqua talked yesterday also about other denials reported in all major

Puerto Rico news media. While his language generally tends to be strong and

colorful, yesterday it was particularly so. In fact, he announced at the

beginning of his program yesterday that he was so incensed that adult

listeners with children present in the room near the radio needed to move

the children elsewhere, where they would not hear him.



<p>The denials reported yesterday in all of Puerto Rico's news media included

the decision by the U.S. First Circuit Court of Appeals in Boston that even

though Puerto Rico's Constitution bans the death penalty, U.S. law takes

precedent, and federal courts in Puerto Rico are empowered to impose that

penalty in Puerto Rico. In handing down the decision, the appeals court

overturned a decision by U.S. District Judge Salvador Casellas in the

Puerto Rico district.



<p>Many Puerto Ricans continue to be amazed at such decisions in light of the

dogged insistence over many years by the U.S. representative at annual

hearings held by the United Nations de-colonization committee that Puerto Rico

is not a colony but that it possesses a significant degree of autonomy.



<p>In another denial, the chief U.S. District Judge in Puerto Rico,

Hector Laffitte, declared that the Puerto Rico Department of Natural and

Environmental Resources does not have authority to control the U.S. Navy's

extraction of water from a river near its Roosevelt Roads Naval Base, on

Puerto Rico's east coast. Military operations on the outlying 20-mile long

stringbean-shaped island of Vieques are directly linked to the Navy's

Roosevelt Roads base.



<p>Other denials reported in the local press yesterday included the refusal of

Rear Admiral Kevin Green, the Roosevelt Roads base commander, to attend, or

to send a representative to, the joint senate-house hearings of the

Puerto Rico legislature in Vieques concerning the referendum proposed by the

governor for the end of July. The lawmakers are in the process of enacting

legislation to enable that referendum.



<p>Returning to the subject of the appeal filed yesterday by Robert Kennedy Jr.

with the Apellate Court in Boston on behalf of his clients, that appeal

notes the original case was filed with the U.S. District Court for

Puerto Rico on 10 October, nearly eight months earlier, and since then the

Navy has staged maneuvers in Vieques in December and in April.



<p>Although not stated in the document, some 180 protesters were arrested for

trespassing in the U.S. Navy's "restricted zone" in Vieques during the

27 April to 01 May exercises. Trials of the protesters are currently

continuing at the U.S. District Court in San Juan, where to date 43 of them

have been sentenced to serve prison terms of up to four months. The sentences

imposed on the so-called Vieques Four, among them the Rev. Al Sharpton, who

traveled to Puerto Rico from New York City to participate in the protest

activity during the most recent bombardment, have drawn widespread attention.



<p>Among the prominent people arrested during those recent protests, but not

yet tried, are Robert Kennedy himself, and U.S. Rep. Luis Gutierrez, of

Chicago.



<p>Gutierrez reportedly was beaten by military law enforcement personnel in

riot gear after he submitted peacefully to being taken into custody. A video

tape of his arrest, recorded by a TV news reporter, was shown during five

hours of testimony before the U.S. House Hispanic Caucus on Tuesday.

According to testimony, Rep. Gutierrez, who weighs just 130 pounds, at one

point was repeatedly raised bodily in the air and dropped or thrown to the

ground by U.S. military law enforcement personnel. At another point, a U.S.

Navy officer reportedly held the high ranking elected U.S. government

official pressed to the ground with a boot to his neck.



<p>The Orlando Sentinel reported Friday that the Rev. Nelson Lopez, wearing

clerical garb, testified he was tear-gassed, pepper-sprayed and hit with

rubber bullets. The Navy was "abusive, disrespectful," he said.



<p>However, according to the Sentinel, Navy Lt. Cmdr. Katherine Goode said in

a telephone interview from the Navy's Roosevelt Roads Naval Base in Ceiba,

Puerto Rico, there was "no basis" to charges the Navy used excessive force.

All protesters were treated with dignity, she said. "The security folks did

an outstanding job in handling a very difficult situation. There were a lot

of people breaking the law that day," Goode was reported to have said.



<p>In their plea for action by the Boston Circuit Court of Appeals,

the plaintiffs represented by Robert Kennedy Jr. allege that Laffitte's

refusal to take action in the case has had the effect of enabling the U.S.

Navy to continue its bombardments of Vieques in violation of the U.S.

Endangered Species Act. The plea asserts the Navy and the U.S. Fish and

Wildlife Service have engaged in a process that amounts to a corrupt

conspiracy to illegally obtain a permit. The document alleges also that

the Navy has filed frivolous motions with the court in an effort to delay

resolution of the case and continue bombardments.



<p>The plaintiffs represented by Kennedy include the Vieques Pro-Rescue and

Development Committee, the Vieques Women's Alliance, the Natural Resources

Defense Council, the Water Keeper Alliance, Horsemen for Peace, the

Vieques Water Keeper, and the Professional Technical Support and Vieques

Sustainable Development Group.



<p>In Wednesday's edition of Juan Manuel Garcia Passalacqua's political analysis

radio program, Analyzing With JuanMa, Passalacqua concluded the program as

usual, by taking telephone calls from the audience. His response to the last

telephone call aired went as follows (transcribed verbatim, as translated from

Spanish):

  

<p>JM (to caller, who has just stated that the three senators' testimony at the

House Hispanic Caucus hearings reminded him of the case of the Miraval sisters

in the Dominitan Republic): "Very good! Very good! I appreciate your reminding

me. Look, I was a boy when the murder of the Miraval sisters occurred. I recall

it vividly. In my home we lived close to the anti Trujillo movement in

Santo Domingo and I recall vividly how the Dominican radio gave that terrible

news that the Miraval sisters died of pneumonia combined with lead - so that the

entire nation would know they had been murdered. And I think that the symbolism

of the Miraval sisters in Dominican history, immortalized in a lovely novel in

the English language, written by a young Dominican woman, that I think has the

title The Day of the Butterflies, is comparable, I have no doubt, with the

dignity, with the tenderness, with the emotion, of those three women yesterday

denouncing before the world the nastiness of their rape by the U.S. Navy. And

I think that if today anyone knows what the bilateral pact of common defense

is, it is [Sen.] Velda Gonz'alez. And I would joke with her sometimes because

of that but now the joke has to die because she knows. And if there is anyone

who knows what the powers are in anexionization it is Senator Norma Burgos. And

if anyone knows what represents valor in politics it is [Sen.] Jasmin Mej'ias.



<p>"And I want to thank you [the caller] for those words because it seems to me

this is the hour of the woman in Puerto Rico and the woman is better represented

by these three brave women. There are other women who usurp power and do not

dare cross the line. And they go around negotiating for multinationals that come

to suck up money here and they fill their mouth and the only thing they do is

to fill their mouth. And it is time to begin comparing women with women because

in Puerto Rico it is the hour of the woman. And of that to me there is no doubt.

And it is the sensitivity of the woman that has been demonstrated in the case of

Vieques. But women have to be distinguished from women, and if this nation

wanted leaders, if this nation wanted brave people - brave beings, men or

women - it has an enormous debt with those faces full of tears, with those hands

over the mouth, with those faces of shock, of those three women who experienced,

as Senator Velda Gonz'alez stated very well, moral rape, which is not less than

physical rape. And what I denounced here on the first day - the first day -

that they had suffered that fondling of their private parts, those women -

yesterday was confirmed in the Congress of the United States. And in the face

of the moral fondling and the moral rape of three senators of Puerto Rico,

the Navy of the United States of America refused to testify and much less, to

ask for forgiveness. And that is how the relationship of Puerto Rico is with

the United States today - and that is how Puerto Rico is with the

United States today - and I do not wish to link ["vincular" - a play on words]

what the [pro-statehood] New Progressive Party wants to link. Because, as I

told you, and with that term, he who links gets his ass 'eaten'. We'll see

you tomorrow in New York, and Monday, here, on Analyzing with JuanMa."



<p>This snippet from the closing of Passalacqua's program, as already stated,

was aired yesterday, Thursday. On Saturday afternoon (tomorrow) at 3:30,

Passalacqua was to go on the air from New York City, with interviews of

some of the leaders and some of those to be honored in the Puerto Rican Day

Parade to be held in New York City Sunday.



<p>Meanwhile, in Puerto Rico, hundreds of people are signing on as volunteers

to serve as human shields in territory claimed by the U.S. Navy that they

view as their own. The land was taken from the people of Vieques by the U.S.

Government early in WWII, as part of the war effort, then retained by the

Navy after the war ended. Since then the Navy has rented out use of areas it

designated practice bombing zones to NATO forces and the armed forces of

other nations. (The population of Vieques dropped abruptly from just under

20,000 residents in 1941 to less than 10,000 following the Navy's seizure of

two-thirds of the island's land area. For some years the Navy sought to move

thousands of residents of Vieques to St. Croix, in the U.S. Virgin Islands,

and to other locations. Today there are still many Puerto Ricans in St. Croix

as a result.)



<p>Besides David Sanes, the security guard killed nearly two years ago while

manning Observation Post number 1, in the bombing zone, by one or more

500-pound bombs released by a U.S. Navy F-18, many people today recall the

death of Angel Rodr'iguez Cristobal, a protester sentenced to six months in

prison for trespassing during Vieques protests in 1979. Some recall seeing

dramatic video clips of those protests on 60 Minutes, including scenes of

U.S. Marines chasing Tito Ti'o, then chief of Puerto Rico Legal Services,

into the surf.



<p>Rodr'iguez Cristobal was one of 11 protesters sent against his will to serve

his sentence outside Puerto Rico, in a federal prison in Tallahassee, Florida.

Shortly before his scheduled release, Rodr'iguez Cristobal was found dead,

hanged in his prison cell.



<p>Many believe Rodr'iguez Cristobal was murdered in prison. The U.S. Government

appears to have been lax in investigating circumstances surrounding his death.



<p>In contrast, in the case of David Sanes, killed by a bomb from a Navy F-18, it

is generally agreed the cause of death was accidental. But, again, it is not

known whether the Navy has conducted an investigation of the cause of the

presumed accident, or what the results - such as possible findings of

negligence - may have been.



<p>Besides Sanes, three other people on the ground are said to have been injured

in that incident. No one seems to know anything about those other people. Also,

some have not forgotten that the same Observation Post number 1, where Sanes

was killed and others injured, was damaged a few years earlier by another bomb

released from an aircraft that missed its target. People wonder why the same

sort of accident occurred a second time, and whether it will happen again.



<p>Reports of fatal accidents involving the U.S. Navy elsewhere in the world,

such as the recent sinking of a Japanese fishing vessel off the coast of Hawaii

by the U.S. nuclear-powered submarine Greenville, and the subsequent notable

absence of a clear U.S. apology, exacerbate such concerns. But the bottom line

is that the bombardment of Vieques, Puerto Rico, today is seen by many of those

who call for peace in Vieques now as spawned by the contempt on the part of the

U.S. for the people of the island captured in the war of 1898 - the island

whose name the U.S. once informally tried over many years, in a blatant show

of disdain, to unilaterally change to Porto Rico.
