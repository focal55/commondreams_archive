An 

hour after the attacks, I was sitting catatonic at my computer screen, trying 

to get some news, when my neighbor poked his head in my office.

<p>"Ever 

wonder," he asked, "why we're so hated? Fifty years ago we were so beloved. What 

happened?"</P>

<p>His question penetrates the simple facade 

built in recent days by the mass media: of America in a battle of Good vs. Evil; 

of the attacks portrayed only as the work of hate-filled religious zealots.</P>

<p>The 

men in the four doomed airliners were filled with hatred and a twisted interpretation 

of Islam. But this explanation alone is not sufficient. It does not account for 

the flammable mix of rage and despair that has been building up in the Middle 

East since the Gulf War's end.</P>

<p>Seven years ago, in Hebron 

in the West Bank, I attended a funeral for a Hamas follower, shot by Israeli soldiers 

after he lunged at them with acid. In the funeral tent, mourners handed out candy 

to celebrate the martyr's ascent to heaven. Afterward, in the street, young boys 

stopped their laughing and roughhousing long enough to tell me that they, too, 

hoped to grow up and die in such an honorable way.</P>

<p>My 

question then was like my neighbor's on Sept. 11: "Why?"</P>

<p><B>Decades 

of humiliation</B></P>

<p>As a journalist working regularly 

in the West Bank and Gaza, I repeatedly witnessed the humiliation and anger of 

a population living under decades of occupation: Israeli bulldozers knocking over 

families' ancient stone homes and uprooting their olive groves; military checkpoints, 

sometimes eight or 10 within 15 miles, turning 20-minute commutes into 3-hour 

odysseys; the sealing off of Jerusalem and the third-holiest shrine in Islam to 

Muslims across the West Bank; the confiscation of Jerusalem identification cards, 

and hence citizenship, from Palestinian students who'd been abroad for too long; 

the thirst of villagers facing severe water shortages while Israeli settlers across 

the fence grew green lawns and lounged by swimming pools; U.S. M-16s used to shoot 

at stone-throwing boys.</P>

<p>Again and again, Palestinians 

asked me: Why does the American superpower support this? Do ordinary Americans 

know about this? Do they care?</P>

<p><B>Death tolls</B></P>

<p>It 

was no surprise when West Bank streets later filled with men burning American 

flags and waving posters of Saddam Hussein, given our country's lead role in sanctions 

against Iraq. Children there were dying from dehydration and disease &#151; a 

half-million excess deaths, according to a 1999 UNICEF study, or 5,000 a month. 

This is almost the projected death toll of the World Trade Center blasts.</P>

<p>Again, 

the questions: Do Americans know about this suffering? Do they care?</P>

<p>At 

work in the Arab streets is the rage of the weak and ignored. Young men, out of 

work and nearly out of hope, look for someone to blame. In such an atmosphere 

of despair, absent any perception of justice or equal treatment, extremism grows. 

In its most perverse form, it helps turn commercial airliners into flaming missiles, 

causing unfathomable suffering.</P>

<p>It can be comforting 

to blame it all on the insane religious fervor of The Other. Much harder is to 

understand that our own failure to witness and address the suffering of others 

&#151; the children of Iraq, for example &#151; has helped create fertile recruiting 

ground for groups seeking vengeance with the blood of innocents.</P>

<p>Now 

the network theme music pounds out the drumbeat of war. Talk shows speak of "dusting 

off the nukes" and wiping out entire countries. Last week, the deputy secretary 

of defense spoke of a "sustained campaign" aimed at "ending states who sponsor 

terrorism." (U.S. officials later said he misspoke.)</P>

<p>But 

if the attacks on the United States lie just as much in rage and a sense of injustice 

as they do in religious fervor, will bombing a country senseless make us safer? 

Or will it help perpetuate more rage, more hatred, more despair &#151; and, quite 

possibly, more terror in the United States?</P>
