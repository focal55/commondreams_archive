As the son of immigrants, I grew up hearing ugly stories about the

old country. They made me a patriotic lover of the Stars and Stripes like

my parents, even as they knew our beloved country was less than perfect.

As an adolescent, the nature of our World War II enemies added in

intensity to the excited tingle I had always felt when I saw our flag.

<p>Of course, I enlisted after my 17th birthday. Flags and tingles were

common in the military. After the war I saw the flags less, but never

without the tingle. Until the 1970s, which is when my country forced me

to break the law to do the right thing.

<p>Chemotherapy saved my daughter's life. But it was accompanied by lots

of vomiting, which could be decreased by inhaling marijuana. This was

years before today's legal availability of the pill form of marijuana's

active substance, Marinol. So, I did the right thing and broke the law. I

got Susie marijuana. And I have never felt that tingle from seeing the

flag again.

<p>Some might argue that I should have obeyed the law and let her

tolerate the disagreeable side effects of her treatment. I disagreed then

and I still do today.

<p>Fast forward to the 21st century. Marinol has two problems. First, it

is expensive and second, it has a slow rate of absorption into the body.

The gastrointestinal tract is a lot slower than the weed's rapid

absorption through the lungs. That slow absorption of the pill means that

those with chronic diseases who had inhaled the weed for nausea and

diminished appetite before the pill was available may find Marinol to be

useless.

<p>Indeed, if the Supreme Court justices who are considering the legality

of California's medical marijuana law walked through a hospital's

chemotherapy unit today, they would smell odors that document that even

those recently diagnosed with cancer find inhalation of the weed to be

more effective.

<p>Of course, the weed is expensive, but that's only because it's

illegal. If it were legalized and classified with restricted medicines

like morphine and cocaine, it would be dirt cheap--literally costing

little more than the dirt in which it was grown. And it would be better

quality and safer than the expensive illegal weed. And our jails would be

less crowded.

<p>Shouldn't the Supreme Court consider those human truths while

inspecting federal and state laws? If they feel obliged to designate

cancer sufferers and their caretakers as criminals, I pray the justices

append advice about answering children's inevitable question: Why is

medical marijuana illegal while addictive and potentially lethal tobacco

is OK if you are old enough?

<p>Will I ever feel that Stars and Stripes tingle again?
