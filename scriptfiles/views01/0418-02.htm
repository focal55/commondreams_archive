Ralph Nader, one of the most frequent and well-received visitors 

              to Madison over the past 40 years, returns tonight to deliver a 

              distinguished lecture at the University of Wisconsin.

<P>Nader arrives as the same man who spoke in Madison in the '70s, 

              '80s, '90s and during the 2000 presidential campaign, and he will 

              deliver the same message about the need for citizens to organize 

              at the grass roots in opposition to the threats to democracy and 

              liberty posed by corporate monopolies and cowering politicians.</P>

<P>But there is no question that Nader is now viewed differently. 

              As the Bush presidency unfolds, with the new president and his misguided 

              minions pushing the ideological envelope further and further to 

              the right, the anger over Nader&#146;s Green Party candidacy of 

              last year has, if anything, mounted. Old friends now dismiss him 

              as "arrogant" and "delusional" because he continues to suggest that 

              the Democratic and Republican parties are, at least at the upper 

              levels, bought by the same special interests. Local Democrats who 

              once hailed Nader as a visionary figure now reject him as a threat 

              to his own achievements or, worse yet, as a political eccentric 

              who ought to be consigned to the scrapheap of history.</P>

<P>But here&#146;s an amusing twist on the Nader bashing that is so 

              much in vogue this spring:</P>

<P>Among the most powerful Democrats in Washington, Nader is viewed 

              in a far friendlier light. Yes, there is a measure of anger at him 

              for having maintained a candidacy that hurt Al Gore in key states. 

              But there is, as well, a grudging acknowledgment that Nader drew 

              progressive voters to the polls, and that those progressive voters 

              almost certainly provided the narrow margins of victory for Democratic 

              Senate challengers Maria Cantwell in Washington state and Debbie 

              Stabenow in Michigan &#151; giving the Democrats a 50-50 split in 

              the Senate &#151; and for several Democratic House candidates, including 

              San Diego&#146;s Susan Davis and Madison&#146;s own Tammy Baldwin.</P>

<P>Perhaps that is why genuinely progressive Democrats, such as U.S. 

              Sen. Russ Feingold, D-Wis., and U.S. Rep. Cynthia McKinney, D-Ga., 

              suggested after the election that Nader&#146;s campaign had at least 

              some positive impact &#151; most particularly when it came to mobilizing 

              young people. As McKinney said recently, "My ability to get elected 

              has always relied on nontraditional people &#151; bringing new people, 

              new supporters (into) the process &#151; so every new voter the 

              Green Party attracts is a potential new voter for me. The whole 

              idea of progressives, I thought, was to have more people participating, 

              not fewer."</P>

<P>When Nader visited Capitol Hill in February, at the invitation 

              of Rep. Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., the Democratic minority leader 

              complimented Nader for running "a terrific campaign." They spoke 

              at length about the success of Nader&#146;s super rallies, where 

              thousands of people &#151; most of them young &#151; packed arenas 

              and paid as much as $20 to hear Nader talk about "deep democracy."</P>

<P>"Nobody is paying to hear (mainstream Democrats) talk about policy," 

              Gephardt admitted. Part of the appeal, Nader told Gephardt, was 

              that "the Greens actually have a more legitimate platform for the 

              old Democratic Party than the Democratic Party does."</P>

<P>Gephardt &#151; who disagreed with the Clinton-Gore line on trade 

              policy, welfare reform, farm aid and a host of other key issues 

              &#151; no doubt agreed. As he prepares his own presidential candidacy 

              in 2004, Gephardt will attempt to avoid the mistakes that Gore made 

              in 2000 &#151; the most significant of which was the assumption 

              that Ralph Nader would bend to the political winds of the moment.</P>

<P>Nader remains an uncompromising force in American public life. 

              For Democrats who have bent so far that they would not recognize 

              Franklin Delano Roosevelt, Nader is a threat. For Democrats such 

              as Gephardt, McKinney and Feingold, however, Nader poses far less 

              of a threat. Rather, he is a necessary reminder that Democrats can 

              and should pursue a more progressive politics.
