The global energy cartel is imperiling the world's environment and

economic stability in a greedy grab for profits that is empowered by a heavy

investment of campaign contributions and corporate connections with media

conglomerates. The energy cartel understands the world's dependency on their

energy commodities such as fossil fuel, natural gas and nuclear.  One of

their top executives,  Dick Cheney, is now Vice-President and the "Czar" for

the energy policy of the United States.   The evil empire of energy has used

OPEC since its inception as a convenient shill to reduce the "supply" and

drum-up the "price" of oil to create an "energy crisis" and an excuse to

charge exorbitant prices for their products.



<p>In the 1970s I worked with a coalition of consumer groups that

brought public awareness to the "energy crisis" rip-off by challenging rate

hike requests and nuclear plant construction permits before the South

Carolina Public Service Commission that regulates the electrical utilities

in our state.  The excuse for raising the price of electricity was the cost

of fossil fuel, natural gas, and nuclear energy and was all blamed on the

short "supply" and  high "price" of  "foreign oil" set by a bunch of Arabs

and Africans in turbans and togas who "ruled" the OPEC nations.  Remember

OPEC causing the gasoline shortage?   When President Jimmy Carter called for

energy conservation and funding research for harnessing renewable energy

sources such as wind, water and the sun, the powerful energy cartel helped

him become a one-term President.



<p>Maybe that's why the Democratic political leadership hasn't

challenged Cheney's proposal to develop new domestic sources of oil, gas and

coal and build new coal-fired and nuclear generating plants.  Cheney

dismissed conservation as "1970s era thinking" that could not get us out of

what he called an "energy crisis".  Cheney favors a government backed push

to drill for oil and gas, including the protected areas of the Arctic

National Wildlife Refuge.  Cheney expounds a "supply" oriented energy

philosophy he learned at the Halliburton Corporation, the largest energy

services corporation in the world,  where he was the CEO for 5 years and

holder of 45 million dollars of stock before he became George W. Bush's

Vice-Presidential running mate.   During Cheney's tenure, Halliburton

received federal contracts and taxpayer insured loans totaling $3.8 billion.



<p>In 1998 Halliburton paid $8.1 billion for drilling and oil industry

equipment supplier, Dresser Industries.  Halliburton also owns Landmark

Graphics Corp., suppliers of production information services and systems

that help energy companies find, produce and manage oil and gas reservoirs

and NUMAR Corp. that furnishes nuclear magnetic imaging to measure oil

drilling.  The most notorious Halliburton subsidiary is Kellogg, Brown and

Root that builds offshore oil rigs, drills wells, and builds nuclear

reactors while employing more than 20,000 people in more than 100 countries,

including the OPEC nations.  Brown and Root has been in the heavy

construction business for more than 65 years and was a big U.S. military

contractor in Vietnam and Kosovo with strong world-wide connections to CIA

activities.



<p>As Bush's Presidential campaign set fund-raising records with hefty

contributions from the  energy business, OPEC began to raise the price of

oil and, by the middle of 2000, energy prices  began to affect business

costs and the stock market.   As the stock market nose-dived, energy

companies' profits soared in the first quarter of 2001, with Exxon Mobil's

profits up 44% from a year ago, enabling them to become the world's top

revenue producer at $52.28 billion; Chevron's profits were up 57% for the

first quarter; and Duke Energy's stock was up 12% in 2001 after rising 70%

in value in 2000, partly from selling high priced electricity to "rolling

blackout" stricken California.  From my experience in opposing Duke's rate

hike requests in South Carolina 25 years ago, I can vouch for their ability

to make big bucks from energy.



<p>By pulling out of the Kyoto global warming agreement to limit carbon

dioxide emissions that cause global warming and increasingly volatile

weather conditions and by pushing for domestic oil and gas drilling, the

Bush-Cheney Administration have prioritized energy profits over the global

environment.     Energy's media connections make  it difficult for the

public to get an unbiased picture of the "energy crisis".   General Electric

Corp. owns NBC, CNBC and MSNBC and GE Nuclear Energy, who design nuclear

reactors and already own and operate 91 reactors world-wide.  Conservative

media mogul Rupert Murdoch owns Fox; the nuclear intensive Westinghouse

Corp., until recently, owned CBS.   Such media influence and the fat "energy

crisis" profits the energy companies can invest in campaign contributions

make it even difficult for politicians to oppose the Administration's

energy cartel juggernaut.
