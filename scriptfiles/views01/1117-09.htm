In came the Northern Alliance. Out came the scissors.



<P>    A primitive last-stand defense? No. Scissors came out in barber shops: symbols of the unshackling from the Taliban.</P>

<P>    Men with their mandatory beards removed. Women letting their faces bask in daylight for the first time in years. These are the definitions of freedom in the "new normalcy" in some parts of Afghanistan.</P>

<P>    Yet a Boston Globe story from the Afghan town of Aashti Qala demonstrates how flummoxed people can be by freedom.</P>

<P>    It tells of a veiled 60-year-old woman shrieking and fleeing when asked if she is ready to walk uncovered.</P>

<P>    "Good heavens," she said. "I am old. I don't want freedom." Her sentiment sounds alien. Then again, it isn't so foreign.</P>

<P>    If we examine what they want from government we quickly see how much of that Afghan woman is in us as a culture and in wanting to rely on state authority. Americans talk a good game when it comes to freedom, but if given their choice many would be as arbitrary and capricious as your garden-variety ruling junta.</P>

<P>    The Bill of Rights is an extremely radical document. That explains why an organization like the American Civil Liberties Union has pariah status across this land.</P>

<P>    The majority wants its way. Civil liberties be damned. Whether the issue is police power, communal evangelism through school (or pre-game) prayer, or devising ways to limit what Americans can read or find on the Internet, civil liberties -- the freedom not to be cowed by the dominant culture -- are as alien to most Americans as they are to that Afghan woman.</P>

<P>    The world's largest Protestant denomination still won't endorse the ordination of female pastors. Shriek. The Southern Baptist Convention is not ready for freedom of that sort. Indeed, three years ago it declared that a woman's role is to "submit graciously" to her husband's authority. No wonder the unratified Equal Rights Amendment throws many Americans into conniptions.</P>

<P>    Freedom? What many Americans really want is cultural domination. Their culture.</P>

<P>    If you'll recall a few years ago Patrick Buchanan was trying to win the heart of a voting bloc by talking up a culture war. What he wanted was public policies that stamped a certain culture as American, and others as alien.</P>

<P>    This disregarded the truth that the American culture is pluralist and doctrinal. Freedom reigns. Freedom is it. That's what the Constitution's Amendments 1-10 are about.</P>

<P>    In recent weeks, with much patriotic fanfare, and in the name of freedom, we've started to pick through assorted freedoms (against illegal search, assuring due process) to bolster the fight against terrorism and secure the homeland.</P>

<P>    We will see to what extent innocent people will be held indefinitely, lives wiretapped and homes searched on bare pretenses.</P>

<P>    Let freedom ring, you say. But face it. You're not sure how far that extends beyond the barber shop.</P>
