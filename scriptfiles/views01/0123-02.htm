<p>&nbsp;Most people would probably agree that TV news anchors and reporters

should have a strong determination to search for and report the truth no

matter what the economic consequences to their station or network might

be. I bet they would also agree that it is a journalists’ duty to expose

and challenge bias or censorship within the news media. But most people

don’t know that in many TV newsrooms journalists are routinely discouraged

and even <i>contractually forbidden</i> from performing these essential

duties. Furthermore, violators are severely punished. Sounds alarming,

but it’s true, as I found out last summer.

<p>On July 26, 2000, without ever submitting a letter of resignation and

with the corporate security chief waiting to escort me from the building,

I “resigned” from my job at WBNS-TV in Columbus, Ohio. To put it more accurately,

I was fired because I challenged station policies that put severe limits

on free speech, and I exposed a particular arrangement between the station

and a major advertiser that allowed the advertiser—rather than the news

department—to have direct editorial control of a daily news segment.

<p>Before going further, I should explain that the expos&eacute; on WBNS

was actually just a small part (two paragraphs) of a 4,000 word essay,

titled “News Media, Corporate Power and Democracy”, that I posted on my

obscure personal website (<A HREF="http://members.tripod.com/chris.shumway/">http://members.tripod.com/chris.shumway/</A>).

<p>My purpose was to write a piece of media criticism in which I would

combine personal experience with a bit of broadcasting history in order

to challenge the popular image of the news media as aggressive public watchdogs

and champions of democracy. In my own way, I just wanted to share—with

whomever might surf by my website—a few of the things I had learned about

the news media after working in it for 15 years and, perhaps, challenge

other anchors and reporters to think about the severe limits placed on

our profession by powerful corporations.

<p>I opened the essay by recalling that early in my news career I readily

accepted the popular media self-image for the simple fact that I never

really thought about it very deeply.&nbsp; I just accepted, at face value,

the pronouncements made by my bosses and other “respected” news professionals

and went about the task of building what I hoped would be a successful

media career.&nbsp; On my way up the ladder, however, I gradually began

to see that the image didn’t jive with reality.&nbsp; First of all, news

broadcasts became more and more loaded with trivial “fluff” pieces or what

I’ve come to call “crash and burn” stories; car crashes, house fires, street

fights and other “hard” news that has very little public relevance.&nbsp;

Secondly, important social, political and economic policies and issues

(elections, taxes, health care, affordable housing, wages, the military

etc.) were generally ignored or presented very briefly, with little or

no critical examination—in may cases it appeared that the copy had been

lifted, word for word, right off a corporate or government press release

(more on corporate influence over the news a bit later).&nbsp; Is this

the way a true public watchdog, using the public airwaves, behaves?&nbsp;

Of course not, but, as I came to realize after finally looking critically

at my own profession, it is the way news outlets driven by the quest for

mega-profits behave.

<p>Quite simply, it's the mad rush for money that drives the news “business”.

TV stations make money by selling audiences to advertisers, which are,

of course, other businesses. Additionally, TV advertisers aren’t really

interested in the whole audience. They want to reach the most privileged

audience thus, all programs, especially the “news,” are aimed at specific

“target” audiences prized by rich advertisers.&nbsp; The competition among

TV news outlets for select audience groups and advertisers limits, rather

than expands, what we see and hear (the points of view and perspectives

we get) on the news: What’s good for big business is good for everyone.

<p>In my essay, I also argued that this practice of&nbsp; “narrowcasting”,

rather than true broadcasting, is largely due to the anti-democratic structure

of our radio and TV system: public airwaves handed over to private corporations

for free with almost no regulation to ensure that the public is being properly

served. We can’t escape the fact that American mass media is based on the

transfer of valuable public resources to un-elected, unaccountable private

corporations intent on maximizing profit rather than serving the public:

it is a system controlled by the few rather than the many.

<p>So you see, I was trying to focus on the big picture and connect it

to the small picture. That’s why I also wrote about the anti-democratic

structure and censorial policies within media companies, putting special

focus on my own contract (which is the standard contract for WBNS news

anchors and reporters). In no uncertain terms, it said that I cannot “make

any statements or remarks” about the station or its sponsors that “tend

to discredit or reflect unfavorably” on them. It also said that, as an

employee, I could not do or say anything that might subject WBNS and its

sponsors—or any other group attached to the station—to “disrespect or criticism”.

<p>Of course this begs two important questions: (1) How can the TV station,

a <i>private </i>news outlet using the <i>public</i> airwaves, get constitutional

free speech or “freedom of the press” protections yet, at the same time,

deny these very rights to its employees; and (2) If a news outlet takes

away or severely limits its employees’ free speech—the freedom to criticize

and to oppose—isn’t this a direct form of censorship that cripples the

employees’ ability to be a responsible journalist?

<p>My underlying argument was (and still is) that news anchors and reporters

must have the freedom to initiate vigorous debate about media policies,

and they must also have the freedom to question and challenge the actions

of their own station and other corporations that might happen to be sponsors,

or business partners, of their station. Otherwise, the entire notion of

a commercial “free press” is only a sad illusion.

<p>The idea that it is an illusion becomes more apparent in another passage

in the essay. In it, I explained how a local bank became not only sponsor

of a WBNS “news” segment, they also got to supply the “expert” commentator

(a bank official) and write the script! Each day the bank would select

a topic and fax the newsroom a set of questions for the anchors to ask

the “expert” during the segment. Many of the questions referred directly

to products and services sold by the bank, or addressed major policy issues

that directly affect the banking industry (interest rate hikes by the Federal

Reserve Board). During the time I observed this practice and reviewed the

faxes (approximately 3 months), the anchors didn’t deviate from the bank’s

script. This was a clear case of an advertiser buying control of the news,

or rather, a TV station selling control of the news outright. Many co-workers

quietly agreed that this arrangement was not only deceptive, but also unethical

and disgusting.

<p>Sadly, deals like this are becoming more and more common in TV news,

but TV executives are not likely to come clean about them; they’d rather

have the public believe that these advertisements disguised as “news” are

really fine pieces of journalism produced by station employees. If an employee

decided to expose these things, it would strike at the heart of the station’s

carefully manufactured image as an unbiased public servant and a noble

steward of the airwaves. So, when the bosses finally read my essay—after

being told about it by some co-workers who had stumbled upon it—all hell

broke loose, as the saying goes.

<p>I was quickly summoned to the General Manager’s office where I was told

that I had breached my contract by writing something that could, in the

words of the contract, “tend to discredit or reflect unfavorably” on the

station and a sponsor. However, they never challenged the facts presented

in the essay or claimed that I was lying or even making distortions; the

fundamental issues I raised—contractual censorship of employees and direct

advertiser control of the news—were never addressed.

<p>I must add that I was aware that my essay could be construed as a breach

of contract (in strict legal terms but not in terms of real justice) although,

I was a bit surprised that WBNS would act so quickly to prove a central

part of my thesis; that dissent is not allowed in a corporate newsroom.

After getting the boot from the GM (the first time I had ever been fired

in my life), I cleaned out my desk and was quickly escorted from the building

by the corporate security chief who had been called to the station <i>before</i>

I was summoned to the GM’s office.

<p>In the days after I was fired, word of what happened spread through

news media gossip channels first, then started reaching the general public.

As a result, my website, which had been rarely visited, started getting

hundreds of hits a day. Many viewers sent e-mails telling me they were

appalled by the station's actions.&nbsp; Broadcasters and journalists from

all over the country were quick to offer support and to confirm what I

had written.&nbsp; “I agree with your comments about the erosion of competent

journalism in the name of blatant capitalism…all at the expense of the

viewers” were the words of one disillusioned TV reporter. Other journalists

from corporate newsrooms shared their own horror stories, from being forced

to do special “fluff” reports for big advertisers and business partners

to “softening”, or even dumping, important investigative stories about

corporate crime and abuse. Some described how internal censorship and the

dizzying amount of corporate spin they were subjected to caused them to

make the painful decision to leave journalism altogether.&nbsp; Not exactly

a ringing endorsement of the profession.

<p>Given this high degree of dissatisfaction within the news media—which

media scholar Robert W. McChesney calls “one of the most striking developments

of the last 10-15 years”—and considering my particular case, I find myself

asking one final question: If news anchors and reporters often admit <i>privately</i>

that important news is either censored or distorted for financial reasons,

and if news outlets are willing to fire those employees who say it <i>publicly</i>,

can there be any more doubt that the corporate news media are incapable

of fulfilling their public duties?
