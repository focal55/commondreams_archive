The results of the WTO Ministerial in Doha, Qatar, have 

elicited some confusion among many of those following the events.



<p><b>A New Round?

</b>

<p>Something was launched at Doha, but to call it a "round" of 

trade negotiations might be stretching the concept of a round.  A 

round means negotiations on a broad range of issues directed at trade 

liberalization.  What was agreed at Doha were: a) negotiations to 

clarify or revise some existing agreements, e.g., anti-dumping rules; 

and b) eventual negotiations for new agreements, e.g., transparency 

in government procurement, investment, and competition policy. 



<p>Getting immediate negotiations going on investment, 

competition policy, government procurement and trade facilitation was 

at the top of the agenda of the trading powers in Doha.  They fell 

short of this objective, being able to secure a commitment for 

negotiations on these issues only after the fifth ministerial in 

2003, and only with a "written consensus" from member countries.



<p><b>Doha and the Developing Countries

</b>

<p>What is clear is that, contrary to the claims of European 

Trade Commissioner Pascal Lamy, Doha did not launch a "development 

round."  The key points of the Doha Declaration, in fact, contradict 

the interests of the developing countries.  For example,

<ul>

<li>There is only a perfunctory acknowledgement of the need to review 

implementation issues, which was the key agenda of the developing 

countries coming into Doha;</li>

<li>The language on the phasing out of agricultural subsidies is 

watered down owing to the strong objections of the European Union;

</li>

<li>There is no commitment to an early phase-out of textile and garment 

quotas because of the strong resistance of the United States;</li>

<li>The demand for a "development box" to promote food security and 

development which was being pushed by a number of developing 

countries was completely ignored;

</li>

<li>There is no commitment to change the wording of the TRIPs 

(Trade-related Intellectual Property Rights) agreement to accommodate 

developing countries' overriding of patents for public health 

purposes;</li>

<li> There is no commitment to change the TRIPs agreement to outlaw 

biopiracy and patents on life, which was a key developing country 

concern coming into Doha;</li>

<li>The declaration eliminates the reference in the draft to the 

International Labor Organization (ILO) being the appropriate forum 

for addressing labor and trade issues, which leaves the door open for 

the WTO to assert its jurisdiction in an area where it has no 

authority or competence.



</li>

</ul>



<p>The resolution of the TRIPs and public health issue is being 

trumpeted as a victory for developing countries.  This is 

exaggerated.  While an attachment to the declaration does recognize 

that there is nothing in TRIPs that would prevent countries from 

taking measures to promote public health, there is no commitment to 

change the wording of the TRIPs agreement.  This is a serious flaw 

since TRIPs as it is currently written can serve as the basis for 

future legal challenges to countries that override patents in the 

interest of public health.



<p><b>A Defeat for Democracy and Development

</b>

<p>In fact, Doha was a defeat for the developing countries, 

notwithstanding the resistance they--and in particular, India--put up 

against arm-twisting, blackmail, and intimidation from the big 

trading powers.  Those of us in Doha were witness, as the Equations 

team puts it, "to the highhanded unethical negotiating practices of 

the developed countries - linking aid budgets and trade preferences 

to the trade positions of developing countries and targeting 

individual developing country negotiators."



<p>Doha was a victory for the forces with a strong interest in 

subverting the interests of the developing countries that form the 

majority of the membership of the World Trade Organization by keeping 

the decision-making process non-transparent and undemocratic.



<p><b>Why Doha will Backfire

</b>

<p>This is why this victory may well be a Pyrrhic one for the big 

trading powers. The combination of developing country resentments 

inflamed by the Doha process, a deep global recession brought about 

by the indiscriminate locking together of economies by accelerated 

trade and financial liberalization, and reinvigorated civil society 

resistance to corporate driven globalization, cannot but erode the 

credibility and legitimacy of the institutional pillars of free trade 

like the WTO.



<p>And without credibility and legitimacy, institutions, no matter how 

seemingly solid they may seem, eventually unravel.



<p>At the conclusion of the Fourth Ministerial, Director General Mike 

Moore thanked the delegates for "saving the WTO."  The end result may 

well be, instead, the accelerated decline of the WTO.   </p>
