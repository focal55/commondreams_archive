ALL YOU NEED to know about Michael Powell, whom President George W. Bush

promoted this week to chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, can be

sum- med up by the statements of close FCC watchers.

<P>

    "He's a listener, an advocate, an effective policymaker," said one.

<P>

"Michael Powell has demonstrated a keen intellect and a firm grasp on public

policy issues," said another. "It's rare that you have somebody in public

office who is so favorably regarded by all constituencies and competing

industries," added yet a third person.

<P>

    Wow. This guy Michael Powell must be hot stuff, right? Wrong. The three

quotes come from Gary Lytle, Eddie Fritts and Robert Sachs, the heads of the

trade associations for the "Bell" telephone companies, commercial broadcasters

and the cable television industry, respectively. These are the very industries

Powell is commissioned to regulate in the public interest. They love Powell for

a reason. He has a record of advancing their interests, not ours.

<P>

    And, as a result of Powell's tenure, their firms will grow much larger,

much more powerful and much more profitable and operate in less competitive

markets. It will be bad news for democracy.

<P>

    Most Americans don't know much about the FCC or what it does, but it is

very important to setting the ground rules for the media and communications

industries.

<P>

    Radio, television and cable companies do not operate in traditional

markets, where anyone with enough cash can enter. These are businesses built on

government-granted monopoly rights to valuable broadcast frequencies, or local

telephone or cable-TV monopolies. When the government awards licenses for these

services, it isn't setting the terms of competition -it is picking the winners.

<P>

    That's why these industries have such huge lobbies to make sure the

politicians and regulators keep doling out the goodies to them. That's why, in

theory, the FCC sets conditions for these companies. If these firms are going

to have semi-monopolistic licenses that make it possible for them to make piles

of money, they should be required to serve the public interest.

<P>

    Powell, who has been an FCC commissioner since 1997, doesn't believe in

that deal. He believes these firms should be "deregulated" and permitted to

respond exclusively to market forces-that is, to exploit their status to rake

in as much money as possible. Powell also is a fan of scrapping limitations on

how much these companies can own and how big they can get. Powell claims that

this will bring more competition to their industries, and that will make media

more responsive to public concerns.

<P>

    But all the evidence of ownership deregulation in communications over the

past five years repeatedly shows the exact opposite. Radio ownership was

relaxed in 1996, and since then over half the stations have been sold and the

industry has been consolidated into the hands of a few giants, each owning

hundreds of stations.

<P>

    That's great for those firms, but bad for the rest of us as we are

increasingly subjected to standardized commercial radio fare marinated in

advertising. Telephone companies have been freed to merge, too, since 1996, and

the number of players has fallen in half. And complaints about lousy telephone

service have skyrocketed in the past four years.

<P>

    Let's face it, if deregulation actually produced more bona fide

competition, these firms would hate it. But it doesn't, so they love it.

<P>

    But don't confuse Powell with the facts. "The oppressor here is

regulation," Powell recently told a conservative think tank forum. "We must

foster competitive markets, unencumbered by intrusions and distortions from

inept regulations."

    This is the sort of drivel that gets corporate CEOs high-fiving each other

in the aisles, as the government then hands the keys to the kingdom over to

them.

<P>

    Don't for a second think that Powell wants real competition, real media

diversity, any more than his corporate paymasters. In the past year, he opposed

the FCC's own cautious plan to open up radio to 1,000 low-power radio

broadcasters to be operated by nonprofit groups. The proposal was opposed by

the commercial giants who fear new competition for "their" listeners.

<P>

    He also opposed setting conditions to the AOL-Time Warner deal, which

created the largest media firm on Earth.

<P>

    The AOL-Time Warner merger deliberations should have embarrassed Powell.

<P>

His father, Colin Powell, owns about $6 million in AOL stock. But by today's

standards of corruption, this barely registers a blip on the radar. So Powell

did not recuse himself, and he strongly advocated the case for the company in

which his inheritance is located.

<P>

    Powell, like President Bush, has indicated he wishes to eliminate the few

remaining ownership restrictions on broadcasters. The rule limiting companies

to having TV stations in no more than one-third the nation is soon to be

relaxed or eliminated. The prohibition on owning multiple TV stations in the

same market, or a newspaper and TV station in the same town, also are possible

casualties of this deregulatory jihad.

<P>

    The net result will be a tidal wave of mergers and consolidation in the

media industries that will make the last five years look like a stroll in the

park.

<P>

    Look for most of the few remaining newspaper companies and cable companies

to become part of the huge media conglomerates like AOL-Time Warner, Disney,

Viacom and News Corp. that already own all the major movie studios, all the TV

networks, all the music companies, most of the cable-TV channels, and much,

much more.

<P>

    Needless to say, such a concentration of media power into so few hands

violates every known theory of a free marketplace of ideas in a liberal

democracy. But who has time for that mumbo jumbo when there is good money to be

made?

    So it will be party time on Wall Street for Goldman Sachs and the other

investment bankers who put together these deals. George W. Bush's 2004 campaign

coffers will be stuffed with tens of millions of dollars from the firms who

benefit by these policies. And Michael Powell will have assured himself a long

and lucrative career in the private sector upon leaving the FCC.
