              Friday, U.S. Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn., and I sat in his book-lined 

              office on Capitol Hill and discussed John Ashcroft&#146;s nomination 

              for attorney general.

</font>

<P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Like 

              U.S. Sen. Russ Feingold, D-Wis., Wellstone is one of the few genuine 

              progressives in the Senate. And, like Feingold, he surprised liberal 

              constituents by declaring in December that he was sympathetic to 

              Ashcroft&#146;s nomination to serve in George W. Bush&#146;s Cabinet.</font></P>

<P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A 

              shared belief that presidents have a right to name ideological allies 

              to their Cabinets, in combination with their personal ties developed 

              during the years when Ashcroft served in the Senate, caused Wellstone 

              and Feingold to view the Missourian&#146;s nomination in a different 

              light than did liberals who knew Ashcroft only by his record as 

              a right-winger with a shocking penchant for opposing the nominations 

              of qualified African-American nominees for federal positions, playing 

              the race card in political campaigns, and praising the defenders 

              of slavery.</font></P>

<P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But, 

              on Friday, Wellstone confided that he had decided to oppose Ashcroft&#146;s 

              nomination. After placing a difficult call to his former colleague, 

              Wellstone publicly explained his position this week.</font></P>

<P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"I&#146;ve 

              known John Ashcroft for some time and I consider him a friend," 

              Wellstone said. "As I&#146;ve said elsewhere, that such a friend 

              can hold such harsh views has been difficult. But while I strongly 

              disagree with him on many issues, it is his record of insensitivity 

              to minority rights, including those of racial minorities, and his 

              mishandling of certain nominations that is most troubling.</font></P>

<P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"There 

              is possibly no issue more important to our future than that of racial 

              reconciliation. But John Ashcroft&#146;s relentless defiance of 

              voluntary school desegregation plans in St. Louis, which prompted 

              repeated rebukes from federal courts; his associations with Bob 

              Jones University and Southern Partisan Magazine; and other similar 

              incidents in his record raise serious questions about his judgment 

              on matters related to race. In my mind, his insensitivity casts 

              doubt on his ability to serve our nation, which must make healing 

              our racial divide a priority, in this role."</font></P>

<P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Noting 

              the "gross distortions" by Ashcroft of the records of qualified 

              African-American and gay nominees for federal positions, Wellstone 

              added, "(The) attorney general&#146;s advisory role in the selection 

              of federal judges, including Supreme Court justices, and the right 

              of the Justice Department to intervene before the Supreme Court, 

              means the influence of the attorney general will extend far beyond 

              the president whom he serves. It is crucial, therefore, that this 

              person be independent and fair-minded, open to arguments from opposing 

              sides, able to take into account the experiences and views of others. 

              I regret that John Ashcroft, despite his many admirable personal 

              qualities, is not the right person for this position."</font></P>

In 

              deciding to oppose the nomination of a friend out of a sense of 

              responsibility to do what is right for the nation, Wellstone made 

              the sort of tough but unavoidable decision that is required of a 

              U.S. senator. He also set a standard that Russ Feingold can, and 

              should, follow.
