            <p>Many of George Bush's supporters say that his recent nominations 

              of Colin Powell as Secretary of State, Condoleezza Rice as National 

              Security Adviser and Rod Paige as Secretary of Education prove that 

              he is serious about racial diversity. Moreover, his nomination of 

              a Latino and two white women to his Cabinet suggests that compassionate 

              conservatism boasts enough room for all sorts of minorities. But 

              before we count the votes for Bush's celebrated--or is it calculated?--display 

              of racial leadership, let's at least acknowledge that we may have 

              run into some dimpled chads. 

            <p> Powell's nomination is a no-brainer, which, as it turns out, may 

              perfectly suit Bush's presidential profile. To take credit for nominating 

              a national hero to extend his stellar record of public service is 

              only a little better than taking credit for inventing the Internet. 

              Powell's halo effect may redound to Bush, but his choice of Powell 

              owes nothing to Bush's fundamental bearing as a racial statesman. 

              Powell and Bush are at significant odds on crucial issues. Powell's 

              vigorous support of affirmative action, his belief in a woman's 

              right to choose and his advocacy for besieged urban children put 

              him to the left of the Bush dogma. To be sure, Powell is no radical. 

              His moderate racial principles are largely acceptable to many blacks 

              because they're not bad for a guy who buys the Republican line, 

              some of its hooks and not many of its sinkers. Unlike Congressman 

              J.C. Watts, the black Republican from Oklahoma who'd just as soon 

              fish all day with his conservative colleagues than cut the race 

              bait. Indeed, Powell's beliefs run the same blush of racial centrism 

              that coursed through the Clinton Administration over the past eight 

              years. The difference is that such moderates, and a sprinkling of 

              liberals, had plenty of company in the Clinton Administration. In 

              a Bush Administration, Powell is, well, a hanging chad. </p>

            <p> Of course, Powell's beliefs will have little substantive impact 

              on his future boss's domestic policies, because he has been dispatched 

              to foreign fields where Bush surely needs the help. So what looks 

              like a plum for black folk may be a pit. True, no black person has 

              ever served as Secretary of State. But once we get past the obligatory 

              gratitude black folk are called on to display when conservative 

              whites finally do something halfway decent, the fact is that Powell 

              will have little influence on the public policies that may hamper 

              black progress under a Bush Administration. Powell has not been 

              nominated as Secretary of Health and Human Services, so his input 

              on welfare, for instance, is lost. Instead, if confirmed, Wisconsin 

              Governor Tommy Thompson will practice his widely praised variety 

              of welfare reform, a policy that on both the local and national 

              level has had a horrendous effect on millions of poor blacks. Neither 

              is Powell slated to be the Attorney General, where he may choose 

              the civil rights czar, who carves the policy groove on race in the 

              Justice Department. Instead, that honor may fall to John Ashcroft, 

              an ultraconservative whose opposition to black interests is destructive. 

              An omen of things to come was glimpsed starkly in Ashcroft's contemptuous 

              scuttling of the nomination of black Missouri Supreme Court Justice 

              Ronnie White for the federal bench. Not only is Powell's value to 

              Bush on race largely symbolic, that symbolism will more than likely 

              be used to cover policies that harm the overwhelming majority of 

              black Americans who were never persuaded by Powell to join the party 

              of Lincoln (Continentals). </p>

            <p> Rice and Paige may be lesser-known political quantities, but they 

              are nonetheless instructive of Bush's racial politics. Rice, the 

              former Stanford provost and assistant national security adviser 

              for President George H.W. Bush, is not as vocal a supporter of affirmative 

              action, preferring a lukewarm version of the policy that may comport 

              well with Bush's nebulous "affirmative access." At Stanford, Rice 

              was not nearly as aggressive as she might reasonably have been in 

              recruiting black faculty, failing to match the efforts of equally 

              conservative universities like Duke. And her record of advising 

              the senior Bush on national security matters indicates that she 

              was a blue-blood conservative in black face. </p>

            <p> As for Paige, his my-way-or-the-highway methods have yielded mixed 

              results for the predominantly black and Latino students in Houston, 

              where he has served six years as superintendent of schools. A proponent 

              of annual standardized tests, a measure heartily supported by Bush, 

              Paige has overseen rising test scores while all but abandoning students 

              who couldn't pass muster. Moreover, Paige supports the use of tax 

              money to fund private education, a policy favored by Bush and many 

              blacks but that could have deleterious effects on poor families. 

              The lure of vouchers is seductive, but it fails to address the fact 

              that there is hardly enough money available to make a real difference 

              to those students whose parents are financially beleaguered. </p>

            <p> With Rice's nomination, the point may be that a black can be just 

              as staunch in spouting conservative foreign policy as the next wonk. 

              With Paige, the point is that a black can promote the sort of educational 

              policies that help some black folk while potentially harming a larger 

              segment of the community. It is clear that such a state of affairs 

              does not constitute racial progress. The irony is that Powell, Paige 

              and Rice were chosen in part to prove an inclusiveness that is meaningless 

              if their very presence comes at the expense of representing the 

              interests of the majority of black folk, especially those poor and 

              working-class folk who are vulnerable and largely invisible. The 

              lesson the Republicans would have us learn is that not all blacks 

              think alike, that we are no ideological monolith in liberal captivity. 

              The real lesson may be that a black face does not translate into 

              a progressive political presence that aids the bulk of black folk. 

              Especially when that face must put a smile on repressive policies 

              that hurt not just most blacks but those Americans committed to 

              radical democracy. If that counts as racial progress, we need an 

              immediate recount.
