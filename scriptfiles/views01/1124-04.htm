One of the most basic principles of the law governing armed conflict is that surrendering 

soldiers are entitled to be treated humanely. In the complex and fast-moving events 

around the besieged northern Afghan town of Kunduz there is a risk of this rule 

being violated on a large scale. The US and other governments need to take a much 

clearer and tougher stance towards their Afghan allies, requiring them to establish 

a prisoner of war camp, not to institute a bloodbath. 

<P>The situation of the pro-Taliban troops in Kunduz is dire. Cut off from the 

main Taliban-controlled area around Kandahar, surrounded by forces of the so-called 

Northern Alliance, and bombed by the US air force, there is huge pressure on them 

to surrender. Clearly many of the Taliban troops want to do just that, and some 

have succeeded. 

<P>However, the process of surrender has been hugely complicated by the presence 

in Kunduz of thousands of foreign fighters - mainly Pakistanis and Arabs - whose 

loyalties are more to al-Qaida than the Taliban. They are more fanatical than 

the Taliban troops, and are reported to have killed many of the Taliban soldiers 

who wish to surrender. These foreign fighters are said to have demanded safe passage 

with their weapons to the Taliban-controlled part of the country, or a neighboring 

state. 

<P>The US government has vigorously opposed any such deal. On Monday, the defense 

secretary, Donald Rumsfeld, urged the besieging Northern Alliance forces not to 

accept a negotiated surrender which would allow the foreign fighters to leave: 

"It is our hope that they will not engage in negotiations that would provide for 

the release of al-Qaida forces; that would provide for the release of foreign 

nationals leaving the country and destabilizing neighboring countries... The idea 

that they would keep their weapons is not a happy one from our standpoint either." 

Rumsfeld added: "So my hope is that they will either be killed or taken prisoner." 

<P>The US is entirely within its rights in urging the Northern Alliance not to 

accept a deal whereby the foreign forces could leave with their weapons. There 

is no obligation on them or the Northern Alliance to accept any such arrangement. 

Mr Rumsfeld may also be justified in saying that the very small US forces in the 

area are not in a position to accept the surrender of large numbers of troops 

and take them prisoner. 

<P>However, any statement that could be taken as implying that the US would rather 

see the foreign fighters dead than in prison would appear to be sailing very close 

to the wind. There is evidence of concern on this point in the Pentagon. Unnamed 

"defense analysts" were immediately reported as saying that Mr Rumsfeld's comments 

should not necessarily be taken to indicate that the US would tolerate attempts 

to kill off all Taliban and al-Qaida troops. 

<P>The central problem with Rumsfeld's remarks lies not in his apparent willingness 

to envisage the killing of the foreign forces, nor even in the fact that he stated 

this when negotiations about a surrender were under way, but in his failure to 

state loudly and clearly the obvious simple principle: if the Taliban and the 

foreign forces surrender, which requires them to lay down their arms, they must 

be treated humanely. This can include taking them prisoner. It cannot include 

massacring them. If the US does not make this point, then the net import of Rumsfeld's 

remarks, justified as many of them are, could easily be taken as tacit advance 

approval of a bloodbath. 

<P>There is little doubt about the law on this matter. True, the war in Afghanistan 

is legally complex. Like many wars since 1945, it is an internationalized civil 

war. It has elements of an international war (to which the main body of the laws 

of war applies) and elements of a civil war (in respect of which there are fewer 

agreed international rules). However, in either case those who lay down their 

arms must be treated humanely. 

<P>This simple rule has indisputably applied to international wars since at least 

1907, when the Hague regulations on land war were adopted. Article 23(d) states 

that it is especially forbidden "to declare that no quarter will be given". As 

regards non-international armed conflicts, common Article 3 of the 1949 Geneva 

conventions lays down the elementary rule that "persons taking no active part 

in hostilities, including members of armed forces who have laid down their arms... 

shall in all circumstances be treated humanely". 

<P>Application of such rules in Afghanistan is extremely difficult. This is not 

a war in which the belligerents on either side are coherent, organized and disciplined 

entities. Respect for the Geneva conventions is in limited supply, and some parties 

(most notably al-Qaida) have committed and applauded crimes against humanity. 

It would be possible to argue that some of the forces involved, for one reason 

or another, are not entitled to prisoner-of-war status. 

<P>Precisely because the situation is so confused, and the risk of mass slaughter 

so high, it is critical that the outside powers involved in Afghanistan enunciate 

clearly, and show seriousness about, such basic rules as that soldiers who surrender 

must be treated humanely. It is possible that some prisoners, after surrendering, 

should eventually be put on trial or in some other way lose prisoner-of-war status. 

But the default position has to be to take them prisoner. In the first instance, 

this would be the responsibility of the Northern Alliance. 

<P>There are two overwhelmingly strong practical reasons for the international 

coalition to be clear about how surrendering fighters should be treated. The first 

is that soldiers - including even fanatical supporters of al-Qaida - will be much 

more likely to surrender if it is clear that they will not be slaughtered. The 

second is that if the international coalition stands by while its Northern Alliance 

partners engage in war crimes, it will discredit itself and risk its own isolation 

and disintegration. 

<P>In September 1982, during its invasion of Lebanon, Israel stood by while its 

local paramilitary allies slaughtered Palestinians in the refugee camps at Sabra 

and Shatilla. This toleration of a massacre discredited Israel's ill-fated Lebanon 

adventure. Clear and public insistence on observance of basic norms could have 

prevented disaster. 

<P>Now, in Afghanistan, such insistence is urgently needed. The discovery of hundreds 

of bodies at Mazar-i-Sharif in the past two days makes it impossible to feign 

ignorance of the huge risk of slaughter. It is shocking that the messages from 

the Pentagon have been unclear on the basic and simple point that if the fighters 

in Kunduz surrender, they will not be massacred.
