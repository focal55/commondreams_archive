COUPLE of days ago, two senior columnists declared "shut up" to those who'll be protesting at next month's Summit of the Americas trade meeting in Quebec city -- before any of them had uttered a word.

<P></P>

Intoned William Thorsell in The Globe and Mail, "The media will validate the street theatre in Quebec city giving it enormously undue attention." He described the "secular chanting" of the protesters as "the trivial meet(ing) the irrelevant."

<P></P>

In the same newspaper, Anthony Westell proclaimed: "The democrats will be in the hall -- not outside. They will be the heads of government and states elected by their voters... Outside the hall will be demonstrators elected by no one, responsible to no one." 

<P></P>

Since this is pretty much the received, conventional wisdom, it's worth taking a closer look at it.

<P></P>

The two commentators do have a point. A small, tangential point. Indeed, no one elected the Council of Canadians or Greenpeace or most of the other organizations in the so-called "civil society" movement that's kicking up such a ruckus about globalization.

<P></P>

The trade unions are an exception. It's also worth recording that Maude Barlow's Council of Canadians has more members than any of our political parties.

<P></P>

Nevertheless, the questions -- "Who the hell are these guys?" "Who do they really represent?" and "Why should we pay any attention at all to them?" -- are valid.

<P></P>

Indeed, they've been asked by the civil society movement, itself. Naomi Klein, the author of the anti-globalization book <i>No Logo</i>, who has become a sort of La Passionata of the movement, has warned her cohorts not to traipse around to every meeting of trade bureaucrats as if "following the Grateful Dead."

<P></P>

The answer to the questions is simple. The anti-globalistas are saying something that needs saying and that no one else is saying.

<P></P>

Fear of globalization, or of the homogenization of all cultures and particularities, and its replacement by a universal corporate agenda in which profit becomes the sole measure of value, is real. The angst may be wrong-headed. It may be exaggerated. It is at times downright hysterical. But it's real because it is deeply felt.

<P></P>

(Surely only the terminally pompous could be shocked that anti-globalization sentiments are expressed in the form of street theatre. All the "democratic" governments that will be present at Quebec city won their elections by the political equivalent of street theatre -- photo ops, spin doctoring, negative advertising and the rest.)

<P></P>

But only these ragtag types are talking about these concerns. Prime Minister Jean Chr&eacute;tien has never said a word about them. U.S. President George W. Bush hasn't and wouldn't understand the question. They've never been discussed in the legislatures that Thorsell and Westell are so reverential about. Only Finance Minister Paul Martin, in some of his musings about the need to regulate international finance, has shown any awareness of the subject.

<P></P>

People are out shouting in the streets because their elected representatives are imperceptive or timid or unknowing. Or all three.

<P></P>

<P></P>

Moreover, they aren't just shouting. They are having an effect. The Battle of Seattle, which started it all, was mostly just theatre. But as a result of that, the Davos World Economic Forum (another unelected organization incidentally, although far more powerful than all the protesters added together in a placard-waving row) invited civil society representatives to explain what the shouting was all about.

<P></P>

And it's by no means only talk. The recent decision of the multinational pharmaceutical companies to slash the prices of their drugs to AIDS/HIV victims in Africa in order to ward off street theatre protests both confirms that there are other values than profits and that these other values -- like decency and generosity -- can, sometimes, be pushed ahead of the cash nexus.

<P></P>

"All politics is local," was the famous aphorism of former U.S. House Speaker Tip O'Neill. In the pragmatic sense he meant it, that's still true.

<P></P>

In another, and a more significant sense, all politics is now international. Within our affluent, ordered societies, there's no scope any longer for politics in the sense of passion, confrontation, ideological debate. Where was there any of this in our last election, or in any election back to our free trade election -- an international issue that's to say -- of 1988? Or in any recent American or British (in that instance, since Margaret Thatcher) election?

<P></P>

Instead, the old "left" vs. "right" division has turned into the globalization vs. anti-globalization division of today. There's conviction on both sides -- that globalization will make us all wealthier, that globalization will reduce us from being citizens (of nation-states) to consumers of multinational corporations. It's messy, it's confused. It's anarchic at times. But it's real. So it's going to get talked about.
