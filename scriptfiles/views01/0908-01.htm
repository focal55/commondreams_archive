AMERICANS CANNOT buy Sudanese oil because it's illegal. The United States has identified Sudan as a terrorist nation because it uses profits from its oilfields to kill, starve,  and enslave the nation's blacks. Christian and traditionalist African  villagers are targeted because they resist being ruled by Khartoum's  version of Islamic Law. Oil profits are enabling the regime to  step up its bombings of hospitals, churches and schools, so Congress has  rightly declared an economic embargo.
<P>

<p>However, it's not illegal to buy stock in the oil companies that  provide the money for Khartoum's holy war.
<P>



<p>Indeed millions of  Americans are inadvertently partners in Khartoum's onslaught because  their pension funds and mutual funds contain shares of Canada's Talisman  Energy, and PetroChina, which are Sudan's petro-partners.
<P>



<p>In June, the House voted  to close the loophole when it passed  the Sudan Peace Act with the ''Bachus Amendment,'' which would evict  Sudan's oil partners from our stock exchanges. The Congressional Black  Caucus, and many church and human rights groups, support this  move to prevent American money from financing what both Congress and the  U.S. Holocaust Museum have warned is genocide.
<P>



<p>But Wall Street is upset, and with the help of the Departments of State and  Treasury, and now President Bush, has begun a campaign to keep  our stock markets open to anyone. They say that  preventing the free flow of capital would damage the free market  economy; any exception is a ''political'' move that would create a slippery slope. Soon, they warn, any business out of political favor could be a target  of capital market sanctions. 
<P>



<p>Alan Greenspan is an especially outspoken  critic. Not only is he opposed to closing Wall Street to the partners of  mass murderers, he also warned against imposing a more stringent level  of disclosure on companies whose profits are made in association with ''rogue states.''
<P>



<p>Why? Because, he predicted, firms would ''move financing  from  New York to London.''  But Talisman CEO, Jim Buckee, under intense fire  for his Sudan oil project, proves Greenspan wrong. Buckee says he would  leave Sudan before he would allow Talisman to be forced from Wall  Street.
<P>



<p>The other arguments against the Bachus Amendment are equally false.  Blocking access to Wall Street to those who help commit  human rights crimes simply comports with the law of nations -  that  well-defined set of traditional norms of international law, generally  accepted among civilized nations, which outlaws only the most heinous  offenses, specifically: genocide, slavery and torture. These are bright  red lines, not slippery slopes, and they are based on principles applied  every day by federal judges in this country as part of the federal  common law. 
<P>



<p>No legitimate corporation has a business plan based on profiting from  the crimes defined in the law of nations, so the Bachus Amendment would affect only a small number of rogue enterprises.
<P>



<p>Vigorous law enforcement helps and does not hinder our capital markets. The United States already has the toughest securities, tax, and  money-laundering laws in the world, yet the wealthiest foreign companies  choose to comply in order to enter the world's largest financial market.
<P>



<p>Capital market sanctions would hardly trigger mass migration to  the foreign exchanges. American corporations that violate the law of  nations overseas may be held responsible for their conduct under state  and federal laws enacted specifically to address these heinous crimes  such as the Torture Victim Protection Act. They would gain no relief  from moving, say, to the London Market. As long as the Fortune 500 stay  on Wall Street, the best and the brightest foreign companies will seek  to belong to this most prestigious of financial clubs.
<P>



<p>Genocide and slavery have been documented in Sudan by such  authoritative human rights groups as Amnesty International, Human  Rights Watch and the United Nations. They have made it clear  that everyone who knows Sudan, knows that oil profits finance the  onslaught. Today, the oil fields are being ''cleansed'' of Africans by  bombing and slave raids.
<P>



<p>The president's pastor, Franklin Graham, son of Billy Graham, built a  hospital in Sudan. Khartoum's planes bombed it, using the Red Cross on  the roof as their target. Bush, who has condemned Khartoum for  what it does, evidently wants to allow their oil partners continued  access to Wall Street. It was Franklin Graham who held the Bible and swore  Bush in to the office of the  presidency. Perhaps, when  he said, ''Preserve, protect and defend this nation,'' he should have  added, ''and its honor.''
