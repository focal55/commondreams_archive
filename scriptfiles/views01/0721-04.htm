We can understand why Congress has voted to spend $33.9 million to send letters informing 112 million American taxpayers that they are probably going to receive tax rebate checks from the federal government. For working Americans, the &#034;refunds&#034; will be so small that, without a reminder, no one would notice.

<P>Of course, that&#039;s the point of the $33.9 million public relations stunt that the postal push represents. The tax-redistribution plan promoted by the Bush administration and passed by a Republican House and a Republican Senate was designed to cut taxes for the very rich while shifting more of the burden onto the shoulders of working Americans. The &#034;refund&#034; itself is simply a public relations stunt designed to fool the great majority of Americans into thinking they will benefit from the make-the-rich-richer scam.

<P>And make no mistake, the reminder letters are a big part of the scam. Not surprisingly, Wisconsin&#039;s progressive representatives were in the forefront of efforts to prevent the use of taxpayer dollars for the PR gimmick.

<P>U.S. Rep. David Obey, D-Wausau, and Tammy Baldwin, D-Madison, were loud foes of the letter lie, with Baldwin saying, &#034;The use of over $30 million of taxpayer money so that the Bush administration can brag about itself is inappropriate. This is tantamount to a taxpayer-funded public relations budget for the president. They should just send out the rebate checks.&#034;

<P>In the Senate, Wisconsin&#039;s Russ Feingold and Herb Kohl maintained their tight-with-tax-dollars records. They voted against spending the $33.9 million and released statements denouncing it as a waste of taxpayer dollars.

<P>So-called &#034;conservatives&#034; such as Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Janesville, and James Sensenbrenner, R-Menomonee Falls, voted to pick taxpayer pockets to pay for presidential PR. Their votes are a reminder that the real tax-and-spend politicians almost always wear the label &#034;Republican.&#034;
