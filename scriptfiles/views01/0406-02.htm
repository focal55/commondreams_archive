It's not easy to look at ourselves as others might see us. For a 

country, the need is especially acute in times of international crisis -- 

but that's when nationalism and other reflexive biases are most likely to 

become pivotal.



<p>One of the ways to test for media slant is to put the shoe on the 

other foot. A big story this month provides an opportunity for inquiry in 

the world of intense media spin.



<p>Here are some excerpts from actual U.S. news coverage, with only 

one type of change -- I've reversed the references to China and the United 

States. The mirror-image narrative is worth pondering.



<p>ABC World News Tonight: "There are concerns about national 

security and a Chinese military flight crew that was forced to make an 

emergency landing during a surveillance flight along the East Coast of the 

United States. The Chinese spy plane was equipped with sophisticated 

intelligence-gathering technology."



<p>CNN: "Chinese military officials say that they are, first and 

foremost, concerned about the safety of the crew. They want that crew 

returned back to China."



<p>CBS News: "China's military agency insists this plane was 40 to 50 

miles off the coast of New Jersey, and if that's true, then the Americans 

are to blame. But if the Americans say, 'No, that plane violated our air 

space,' or, 'Sorry, we have to hold the crew and the plane while we 

investigate this incident,' well, then this could get ugly."



<p>ABC's Good Morning America: "There is a major story now going on 

-- a very troubling international incident. It has been more than 35 hours 

since anyone has heard from the 24 Chinese -- 22 navy, one each from the 

air force and marines -- forced to land on Long Island."



<p>The Associated Press: "China is keeping three destroyers in the 

vicinity of Long Island, where a Chinese Navy spy plane landed after 

colliding with an American fighter jet."



<p>CNBC News: "Chinese diplomats are scrambling to smooth over 

tensions with Washington after Sunday's midair collision between a Chinese 

spy plane and an American fighter jet."



<p>CBS Early Show: "Frustrated Chinese diplomats are trying to secure 

the release of a spy plane and its crew from the United States."



<p>The Associated Press (headline): "As American Military Might 

Develops, Friction With China Grows More Likely"



<p>NPR's All Things Considered: "Chinese surveillance aircraft for 

years have flown around the United States monitoring radar transmissions 

and eavesdropping on American communications. And the Americans routinely 

send their own jets up to follow the Chinese aircraft around. But China 

says these cat-and-mouse games have become more dangerous in the past few 

months with the American fighters acting more and more aggressively."



<p>The New York Times: "American fighter jets have flown dangerously 

close to Chinese reconnaissance planes over the Atlantic near the East 

Coast several times in recent months, prompting complaints from Chinese 

officials to the Americans, senior Chinese officials said today."



<p>Los Angeles Times: "The seizure of a Chinese Navy spy plane by the 

Americans could cost China vital information about how America's military 

operates and might inflict wider damage if Washington shares China's 

secrets with other potential adversaries, Chinese defense officials and 

experts said yesterday."



<p>PBS NewsHour With Jim Lehrer: "China's President Jiang Zemin today 

demanded that the United States return a Chinese Navy surveillance plane 

and its crew. It collided with an American jet fighter early Sunday off 

Long Island in New York and had to make an emergency landing there. The 

fighter crashed at sea and its pilot was missing."



<p>The Christian Science Monitor (headline): "America's Demands 

Prolong Dispute"



<p>Scripps Howard News Service: "Family members of the crew of the 

Chinese Navy spy plane held captive in the United States are filled with 

anxiety, fear and rage."



<p>The Associated Press: "Anger and impatience began surfacing 

Tuesday among friends and loved ones of 24 Chinese spy plane crew members 

still confined at an American military base."



<p>San Francisco Chronicle (headline): "How Yangzhou Mom Told Kids 

Daddy Is Captured Spy"



<p>The Wall Street Journal (editorial): "The status of the downed 

Chinese Navy reconnaissance plane and its crew on Long Island remains 

unknown, and the onus is clearly on the Americans to clarify their 

intentions.... Washington attacks the notion of a 'pax Chinacana' in the 

Western Hemisphere, even calling bilateral security alliances threats to 

stability... America's more enlightened leaders now need to move quickly to 

prevent a small incident from escalating into a dispute that fans the 

flames of nationalism."
