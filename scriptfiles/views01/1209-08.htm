A few privileged Afghan women have been caught smiling for AP cameras, but 

  many Afghan women, men and children are silently dying behind the burqa of 

  U.S. deceit.

<p>The facts are simple. Massive food distribution programs put in place prior 

  to 9-11 in response to widespread famine were derailed by the anticipation of 

  and then the actual U.S. bombing campaign, and have been even further set back 

  by the Taliban's retreat. According to the New York Times (11/30/01), &quot;In the 

  past two weeks, the tonnage [of aid] delivered dropped to a pace less than 

  half of what it had been in the previous two weeks.&quot; The problem is that the 

  &quot;towns and cities are so chaotic that relief agencies cannot safely operate. 

  Many roads are off limits because of lawlessness and banditry.&quot;</p>

  <p>Those of us who opposed the U.S. war in Afghanistan nevertheless saw its 

  apparent rapid resolution as an opportunity to at least get much needed 

  supplies into the country. Having routed the enemy, perhaps the United States 

  would stop the bombing, allowing food trucks to move in from across the 

  border. But, instead, the opposite is true. As of this writing (December 5), 

  the bombing continues, civilian populations are left at the mercy of marauding 

  gangs, and food aid dwindles.</p>

  <p>There are a few simple things we could do that would immediately turn down 

  the torture in Afghanistan.</p>

  <p>First, the U.S. should stop bombing. There is no real accounting yet of the 

  civilian casualty rate, but reports in the last few days claim that U.S. bombs 

  hit four villages near Tora Bora, possibly killing hundreds (NYT 12/3/01). 

  This is an unethical and illegal use of U.S. firepower. If it's Osama bin 

  Laden who we are still after, it is never too late to apprehend him in a 

  manner that accords with international law -- present proper evidence and 

  allow the UN to mount a prudent, ground-based multilateral campaign to capture 

  him. In any case, since there is no Afghan enemy mounting any kind of defense 

  or engaging in battle, there is no excuse for large-scale bombings -- whether 

  directed by the U.S. or the UN.</p>

  <p>Second, the bridge to Uzbekistan, which is a key passage for aid trucks, 

  should be secured. And we should meet Uzbekistan's demand that an 

  international force provide security at their Afghan border. Instead American 

  military officials are saying that although they &quot;recognize the urgency of 

  opening the bridge from Uzbekistan, [U.S.] troops will not be protecting the 

  border.&quot;</p>

  <p>There is callous disregard for human life in this casual acknowledgement of 

  the urgency. American officials understand the consequences of their 

  inactivity, but are blithely sitting back and saying they want Afghan forces 

  -- not foreign troops -- to police the roadways, when the only Afghan forces 

  that exist in the country are &quot;lawless bandits,&quot; and it is American officials 

  themselves that installed them. Having destabilized the country to the point 

  where it is not even safe for aid trucks to travel, it seems the U.S. is 

  washing its hands of the disaster.</p>

  <p>If only that were the case.</p>

  <p>Instead, the U.S. is actually blocking efforts to bring in the very 

  peacekeepers that might secure the roads and borders, and facilitate the 

  transport of life-saving aid. Buried in an article about how the Northern 

  Alliance, during negotiations in Bonn, finally relented on allowing foreign 

  peacekeepers into the country, the Boston Globe</p>

  <p>(11/30/01) reported that some U.S. officials believe peacekeepers will be a 

  nuisance to their unilateral conduct of the war. &quot;Citing Bush Administration 

  officials, the Washington Post reported that `the U.S. Central Command, which 

  oversees the war in Afghanistan, is opposing the imminent deployment of 

  peacekeepers in areas freed from Taliban control out of concern this could 

  encumber U.S. military operations.'&quot;</p>

  <p>In a New York Times article (12/3/01) about the Bonn negotiations, a brief 

  aside mentions the &quot;Pentagon's unwillingness to take part in any peacekeeping 

  force or to favor placing peacekeepers anywhere where they could get in the 

  way of the war against Al Qaeda.&quot; Specifically, since November 12 when the 

  Northern Alliance took Kabul, the Pentagon has blocked proposals by France and 

  Britain to send thousands of troops to secure Kabul, the northern half of the 

  country, and aid routes. On December 4, the Pentagon said it would &quot;not object 

  to peacekeepers confined to Kabul and its immediate vicinity&quot; -- a concession 

  that is mostly symbolic (only 200 peacekeepers will be admitted) and is 

  nonetheless entirely irrelevant to ensuring open channels for aid (NYT 

  12/5/01).</p>

  <p>Third, the U.S. should reconsider food airdrops. Dropping &quot;Humanitarian 

  Daily Rations&quot; -- bright yellow packages, decorated with the American flag and 

  containing 2200 calories worth of peanut butter, shortbread, and fruit 

  pastries -- is counterproductive. Airdrops undermine the work of neutral aid 

  organizations by turning humanitarian assistance into an attempt to win 

  &quot;hearts and minds.&quot; They ignore the special needs of malnourished children who 

  require a specific diet. &quot;If you would give peanut butter to a severely 

  malnourished child, you are likely to do more harm than good,&quot; says Lucas Van 

  den Broeck of Action Against Hunger (Boston Globe 10/25/01). And the airdrops 

  bypass crucial distribution methods, which ensure food gets to all who need 

  it, not just to those nimble enough to gather the yellow packets as they drop 

  from the skies, assuming, that is, that they land where people can reach them 

  and not among land mines (10 million of which litter the Afghan landscape). 

  According to at least one UN report (Boston Globe, 11/30/01), two children 

  have already been killed &quot;when they stepped on mines running across a field 

  trying to pick up food packets.&quot;</p>

  <p>We won't see pictures of their exploded bodies in the morning newspaper 

  because those images are a theat to the Pentagon's ongoing prosecution of the 

  &quot;war on terrorism.&quot; Those images must stay safely shrouded from public view. 

  While the media showcase the newly revealed faces of Afghan women, the 

  innocent victims of the U.S. war are still thickly veiled.</p>

  <p>This is a veil that U.S. citizens have the power to lift, and the 

  consequences of doing so are immense. We should expose and demand an end to a 

  war that has turned Afghanistan into a world stage for the theatrical display 

  of U.S. might and banal disregard for human life.</p>
