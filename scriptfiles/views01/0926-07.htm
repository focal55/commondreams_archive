<i>"They have attacked America because we are freedom's home and 

defender; This crusade, this war on terrorism, is going to take a 

while, but we will rid the world of the evil-doers."</i> 

–President George W. Bush



<p>It’s been two, short weeks since the World Trade Center attack, 

and I’m absolutely terrified. The most powerful country in the world 

is wallowing in its own panic, and in so doing tearing at the roots of 

our liberty here at home, and planting the seeds for terrible violence 

throughout the world. Almost 7,000 innocent Americans are dead, 

the UN has pulled aid workers out of Afghanistan in fear of U.S. 

retaliation, hundreds of thousands of refugees there are on the 

move, and the World Food Program is warning that as many as 5 

million Afghanis could starve to death as a result. Are our lives 

really this fragile?



<p>Without any debate or even much discussion, Congress has given 

the President a $40 billion “down payment” to fight a war on 

terrorism, and granted him extraordinary and unprecedented 

powers to do it with. It seems clear that the government will soon 

repeal restrictions preventing us from conducting extrajudicial 

executions – assassinations – hiring known human rights abusers, 

and will grant the Justice Department sweeping powers to conduct 

wiretaps and massive surveillance. And we’ve only just started 

fighting this war. This “crusade” has barely just begun. Truth be 

told, I’m scared to death what tomorrow may bring. Are our lives 

really this fragile?



<p>Terror is as much of a threat to our humanity as it is to our lives 

and property. If we would kill, or allow to be killed, innocents to 

protect "our way of life," then what is it that we are protecting? If we 

would kill, or allow to be killed, innocents then we will be morally 

indistinguishable from that which we claim to be fighting: terror. We 

have our “reasons," yes, but then so do the people we are 

opposing. They are also responding to something. They also claim 

to be defending something. They also find justifications for their 

actions - rationalizations for the unjustifiable. 



<p>It is distressing to watch as we recklessly pretend that the men 

who killed themselves in order to strike so terribly at us on 

September 11th attacked us, as the President said, “because we 

are freedom’s home and defender.” It is distressing to imagine that 

we are unable to see that their pain is like our pain; unable to 

imagine that their actions here might have been in response to our 

actions there. These people are locked out of the political 

structures of their own nations in part because of our actions and 

support. They see us acting in ways that they define as 

"terrorism." Are the hundreds of thousands of Iraqi civilians who’ve 

been killed over 11 years of bombings and blockade really this 

invisible to us? Are the daily humiliations and deaths of 

Palestinians struggling under a vicious, military occupation that we 

help fund and support really this invisible to us? Are our lives really 

this fragile?



<p>Our anger toward the terrorists who killed so many innocent 

Americans is reflected in our victims and would-be victims across 

the world with the oldest and clearest lesson in the history of the 

world: violence begets violence. 



<p>There are a set of beliefs operating here, from within our pain, that 

refuses to acknowledge reality. Without confronting these 

misconceptions it will be very difficult to move forward. We must 

not continue a cycle of violence where our feelings of pain cause us 

to lash out and create similar feelings in those whom we would 

deem responsible for our suffering. For in imposing unjustifiable 

suffering on others we break our own compact, and become 

ourselves like these terrorists. Today, as we move so recklessly 

toward war, what seeds are we planting for future catastrophes? 



<p>When Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) says, “We are coming after you. 

God may have mercy on you, but we won't,” he is speaking from 

pain and in panic. When Sen. Zell Miller (D-GA) says, “Bomb the 

hell out of them. If there's collateral damage, so be it. They 

certainly found our civilians to be expendable,” he’s speaking from 

pain and in panic. When Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul 

Wolfowitz says that we are going to “end states” that sponsor 

terrorism, and our entire government puts the world on notice that 

everyone must “choose sides,” that we no longer differentiate 

between terrorists and the countries they may live in, and that they 

are either “with us or against us” - we are speaking from out of our 

pain and our panic. Our lives really are this fragile.



<p>Arabs and Muslims desire no more - or less - than the things we 

desire: peace, security, a chance to build a brighter future for 

ourselves and our families. Though they will never secure peace 

through violence, or security through violence, these extremist 

movements  make inroads among all peoples when moderate ones 

fail to secure these basic forms of human dignity for their peoples. 

As we are witnessing right here, right now. Our lives really are this 

fragile.



<p>We must face our own pain, and the pain we have caused others, 

with understanding and compassion. We must face the hatred we 

have sown around the world, and the hatred we have sown in our 

own hearts, with understanding and compassion. We must meet 

violence, at home and abroad, inside ourselves and in the world 

around us, with love. Our lives really are this fragile.



<p>We are supposed to be a nation of law. We are supposed to stand 

for justice, for human rights and for civil liberties; not for blind or 

indiscriminate violence and vengeance, and not for panic. If we 

would stop terrorism, we must go after its root causes: poverty, 

injustice, oppression. A superficial attempt to go after the 

symptoms of this problem rather than its wellspring will surely fail, 

and to disregard the rule of law and claim that we can attack 

anyone anywhere on "evidence" we will subsequently refuse to 

release, to kill other's children to supposedly protect ours - all of 

this will set a terrible precedent. It will say to the world that the 

only law we acknowledge outside of our borders is a drumhead 

court's, a star chamber's. It will say that all we really respect is our 

own power, thereby demonstrating to others that power is all we 

will really respond to. But none of the causes in this world - 

including our self-“defense”- is worth a single, innocent life. Not 

one. That’s their logic, terrorist logic - that we must to kill to save 

the world. The truth is the exact opposite: as both the Torah and 

the Qu’ran teach, “To save one life is as if you have saved the 

world.”



<p>On September 16th Vice-President Cheney said, “I think this is 

going to be a struggle that the United States is going to be involved 

in for the foreseeable future. . . . It's going to require constant 

vigilance on our part…” He’s absolutely correct. And we must 

remember that constant vigilance is not just the price for 

maintaining our liberty and our humanity - it’s also the cost of 

destroying them. Our lives are really that fragile.
