As the waters of the Mississippi River crest and engulf towns in

Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Iowa, media attention highlights the heroic

efforts of midwestern citizens to stem the flooding.  With the

mobilization of local, state, and federal resources, these

overwhelmingly white residents are aided in their attempts to salvage

something of their threatened situation.

<p>Farther downstream from the banks of the Mississippi but on one of

its tributaries, the Ohio River, another disaster has seemingly come to

a close.  In the aftermath of the murder by a Cincinnati policeman of an

unarmed young African-American, Timothy Thomas, some black residents

exploded in rage and “rioted” for several days.  However, instead of

sympathy being extended to those whose emotions overflowed the natural

dikes of benign neglect, the “rioters” were denounced as violent and

out-of-control thugs.  There were no concerted efforts by federal,

state, or local authorities to deal with the underlying causes; only the

predictable condemnations by those in power and those blind to the

righteous anger of black citizens of Cincinnati.

<p>Part of the blindness to what African-Americans across the country

are up against with police brutality, racial profiling, and continuing

institutional discrimination and indifference inheres in the

invisibility of race as a factor in public policy.  Such invisibility

feeds what is construed as natural and unnatural disasters and what can

be done to alleviate the concomitant suffering.

<p>The privileging of white citizens at the federal level has often

hidden behind governmental policies on housing, public works, and relief

programs.  From the New Deal’s exclusion of black farm workers from

Social Security to federal housing programs that reinforced restrictive

covenants to highway construction that aided white flight and destroyed

black neighborhoods, whites have benefited at the expense of the

continuing disadvantaging of blacks.  Even so-called affirmative action

programs have had a greater impact on white woman than people of color.

No wonder many African-Americans still feel that “if you’re white,

you’re alright; if you’re black, get back!”

<p>Hence, when it comes to the recent flooding, no one questions why

people continue to live on flood plains, getting federal and state

assistance to fend off a “natural” disaster like flooding.  But what if

the situation were reversed?  What if the overwhelming number of people

affected by the flooding were African-Americans? Would they be exempt

from criticism of their stupidity for living on dangerous flood plains?

Would they be excoriated for getting government handouts to help them

pull themselves up by their water bootstraps?

<p>And what if an overwhelming black police force was shooting down

unarmed whites in city after city with no major change in policing

practices?  What if white males were constantly harassed by the police

and security guards because of alleged suspicious behavior?  What if the

media persistently pathologized white music and white youths as

potential dangerous predators who needed to be censored and controlled?

<p>So, what is natural and unnatural in all of this?  Are we destined

as a nation to turn a blind eye to the lingering vicious repercussions

of the invisibility of whiteness and the visibility of a blackness?  How

much longer do we ignore the sign of “no more flood, the fire next time”

before we are all engulfed in a conflagration of our own making?
