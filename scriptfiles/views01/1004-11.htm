Propaganda - most simply, 

      information used to persuade a group - is as old as civilization. The 

      Aztecs used it to rationalize human sacrifice. Alexander the Great 

      understood its symbolic power and had his image etched on coins. 

      

<P></P>

But propaganda has always been most crucial during periods of 

      conflict and war. 

      

<P></P>

So today, with advertising and other forms of modern persuasion 

      ubiquitous, how do leaders slice through the muddled cacophony and target 

      citizens with messages? 

      

<P></P>

"The whole notion of propaganda now is up for grabs," says Robert 

      Thompson, a professor at Syracuse University. "In this age of 24-hour news 

      and spin, where there is constant coverage, propaganda has come out of the 

      closet and it really lives among us every day." 

      

<P></P>

If Thompson is right, what does this mean to the "War Against 

      Terrorism," which seems to be moving toward a more active phase in 

      Afghanistan this week? 

      

<P></P>

Unlike past military efforts, the White House has warned the new 

      war will unfold with "unprecedented secrecy." Though it's now a cliché, it 

      is important to remember truth is often the first casualty of war. 

      

<P></P>

Ironically, says Thomas DeLuca, a political science professor at 

      Fordham University in New York, the sheer magnitude of the Sept. 11 

      terrorist attacks created a temporary "propaganda-free zone" because 

      people were simply horrified by the visceral images. 

      

<P></P>

For days there were no television commercials. Almost all news 

      coverage was devoted to the story. The entire world seemed to collapse 

      into the deepening tragedy. 

      

<P></P>

"This is an unprecedented event in U.S. history," DeLuca says. 

      "There has never been an attack like this. Concentration on this event is 

      highly focused. People want the president to have a plan, to reassure 

      them, to be straightforward. 

      

<P></P>

"So George Bush will have an enormous benefit as his words cut 

      through the propaganda that is usually around us." 

      

<P></P>

Anthony Pratkanis, professor of psychology at the University of 

      California in Santa Cruz, and author of <I>Age Of Propaganda: The Everyday 

      Use And Abuse Of Persuasion</I>, agrees. But he says in the weeks ahead, 

      as collective shock begins to ebb, Bush will be faced with a number of 

      daunting challenges. "If Bush wants to maintain and sustain the effort, 

      the emotional propaganda will be okay for a short war, but in the long 

      term he needs to deliver persuasion. He needs to form consensus and argue 

      with substance, not slogan." 

      

<P></P>

That seemed to be the case recently, as Bush addressed U.S. 

      Congress. As cameras rolled and politicians and lawmakers frequently 

      wobbled to their feet, and to thundering applause, Bush delivered a 

      rousing, evocative speech. 

      

<P></P>

But the raw emotion and patriotism that has since bloomed atop the 

      rubble in New York and Washington is not necessarily beneficial to anybody 

      in the long run, says Nancy Snow, assistant director with the Center for 

      Communications and Community at UCLA. "A `war mentality' needs to be 

      decontextualized. It needs to be very clear, black and white, good guys 

      versus bad guys," says Snow, author of <I>Propaganda Inc.: Selling 

      America's Culture To The World</I>. 

      

<P></P>

"So you end up with a single enemy, with slogans like `Wanted: Dead 

      or Alive,' ones that simplify the issues. Bush is using an `everyman' 

      approach to what is actually a very complex problem, burdensome in a 

      historical and economic context." 

      

<P></P>

And this simplification, whether deliberate or not, can cloud 

      fundamental issues. In times of conflict, things are not always as they 

      appear. 

      

<P></P>

Before the Persian Gulf War, for example, the world gasped with 

      reports that Iraqi troops were yanking sick babies from hospital 

      incubators and leaving them to die on the floor during the invasion of 

      Kuwait. The "dead babies" account was repeated hundreds of times, in the 

      media and in speeches by U.S. leaders, who were now clearly on a war 

      footing. Other reports - that Iraq had amassed thousands of troops along 

      the Saudi Arabia border - were also used to convince the public that 

      military action was necessary. 

      

<P></P>

Both of those reports proved incorrect, but not until the war was 

      over. 

      

<P></P>

Larry Jacobs, a political science professor at the University of 

      Minnesota, says the Persian Gulf War took traditional propaganda to a new 

      level as U.S. authorities controlled the flow of information in the media 

      and expanded the lexicon of military euphemisms. Cruise missiles. Smart 

      bombs. Collateral damage. Safe bunkers. Hard targets. Hit ratios. Surgical 

      strikes. To western television viewers, the war must have appeared 

      essentially bloodless. 

      

<P></P>

John R. MacArthur, publisher of <I>Harper's</I> magazine and author 

      of <I>Second Front: Censorship And Propaganda In The Gulf War</I>, says he 

      believes the war on terrorism will unfold with even more secrecy and 

      censorship. "Already we have a kind of `ahistoricality' setting in," he 

      explains. "Nobody here is talking about some very important issues. You're 

      simply not allowed to discuss the history of American foreign policy." 

      

<P></P>

Such discussions are seen as unseemly, morally ambiguous, and 

      steeped in preposterous and offensive anti-Americanism. The issue, to 

      many, is simple good versus evil. 

      

<P></P>

Says Jacobs: "The whole notion of propaganda raises a larger 

      question: How do you control and manage press reports and the information 

      that is reaching the general public?" 

      

<P></P>

During the uprising in Germany, as the Nazis gained power, Josef 

      Goebbels was able to impart nationalist rhetoric and manufacture consent 

      through selective advertising, state-produced films, and elaborate, 

      orchestrated public events. (Adolf Hitler also asked Leni Reifenstahl to 

      film the Nazi Party's annual rally in Nuremburg. Her film, <I>Triumph Of 

      The Will</I>, is now considered a seminal exercise in fascist propaganda.) 



      

<P></P>

Decades later, Slobodan Milosevic created "demo networks" - ragtag 

      groups of unemployed youth that would optically boost the size at rallies 

      held for Serbian nationalism. 

      

<P></P>

More recently, Osama bin Laden, the Saudi exile U.S. Authorities 

      are calling the prime suspect in the recent attacks, has filmed several 

      training videos. As tools of propaganda, the grainy, disjointed footage is 

      used to mollify moderates and recruit new soldiers for the Holy War. 

      (During its bloody war with Russia, Afghan rebels were given camcorders to 

      record their triumphs.) 

      

<P></P>

In totalitarian states, persuasion is straightforward. Citizens are 

      simply told what to believe and how to behave. But in democratic nations, 

      governance has nuance, inextricably tethered to divergent principles of 

      individual freedom and mass control. 

      

<P></P>

As scholar Noam Chomsky says: "Propaganda is to democracy what 

      violence is to totalitarianism." 

      

<P></P>

In this context, says Pratkanis, where propaganda is concerned, 

      governments realize the importance of the media. "The mass media is now 

      the primary place where we have political discussions. So one of the keys 

      to effective political leadership is being able to control the news 

      media's agenda. That agenda is not necessarily <I>how </I>you are talking 

      about something, but <I>what</I> you are talking about." 

      

<P></P>

In the war against terrorism, he says, there have been a number of 

      examples where U.S. Authorities announced, "they were planning to release" 

      certain information in the future. This allows the media to run a story 

      about the "future release" of information, rather than the information 

      itself. 

      

<P></P>

"This war will be a challenge for democracy itself," Pratkanis 

      predicts. "Because democracy thrives when everything is in the light of 

      day. Now democracy in the United States will require a high degree of 

      trust." 

      

<P></P>

And trust is a commodity in rapid decline. The Internet, decades of 

      independent research, and the rapid evolution of alternative media has 

      created a population that is much more sophisticated in its ability to 

      recognize and decipher propaganda - irrespective of the source. 

      

<P></P>

"Audiences throughout the world are constantly becoming more 

      exposed to the latest in international mass media entertainment, they are 

      better trained, more aware, often more cynical," notes Oliver Thomson, 

      author of <I>Easily Led: A History of Propaganda</I>. 

      

<P></P>

Randall Bytwerk, a professor of communication at Calvin College in 

      Michigan, author and a foremost expert in propaganda, says: "Propaganda, 

      and the control of public opinion, becomes harder when you lack control 

      over the images." 

      

<P></P>

This proved to be the case in Vietnam, where public support 

      suddenly dipped as the horrifying images of war were broadcast back home. 

      "Vietnam was a turning point because there were reporters all over the 

      place," Bytwerk says. 

      

<P></P>

In the stormy, post-Vietnam years, the U.S. has taken a cautious 

      approach to war. (In fact, the number of firefighters and police offices 

      who died during rescue efforts at the World Trade Center is more than the 

      total military personnel who have fallen in combat since the 1983 invasion 

      of Grenada.) 

      

<P></P>

Given the global scope of the new war, and the potential 

      repercussions, Garth Jowett, a communication professor at University of 

      Houston, says Bush has to be very careful in the propaganda he uses. "I 

      fully expected a propaganda onslaught that was going to be totally 

      irrational. But as I understand it, there was an internal conflict within 

      the Bush administration in terms of what kind of message to give the 

      American public." 

      

<P></P>

Jowett says many people have compared the attacks with Pearl 

      Harbor. But the analogy is problematic. In that case, there was a clear 

      nation-state enemy. And it's important to remember, he adds, that most 

      Americans did not see footage of the Japanese attack for almost a year. 

      

<P></P>

"In terms of propaganda, those visual images (of planes striking 

      the World Trade Center) could not be matched by any other imaginable 

      images," says John Lampe, chair of the Department of History at the 

      University of Maryland. "In fact, if there is any propaganda campaign at 

      play at all, it is to prevent the violent, stereotypical response we have 

      seen domestically in the past." 

      

<P></P>

Lampe is referring to the threats and attacks that have been 

      leveled at Arab-Americans and Muslims throughout North America. The 

      violence, including suspected murder, has raised the specter of the 

      Japanese internment camps during World War II. 

      

<P></P>

As Jowett notes: "Bush has to maintain the public's confidence that 

      the government will actually do something. But he also doesn't want to get 

      the public so riled up so that they are running out murdering their own 

      citizens." 

      

<P></P>

And as Bush said during his speech to Congress: "I also want to 

      speak tonight directly to Muslims throughout the world. We respect your 

      faith. It's practiced freely by many millions of Americans and by millions 

      more in countries that America counts as friends." 

      

<P></P>

First Lady Laura Bush went on <I>60 Minutes </I>recently to discuss 

      the importance of solidarity and urge Americans to not attack their fellow 

      citizens. And during the recent celebrity telethon, <I>America: A Tribute 

      To Heroes</I>, a number of stars, including Will Smith and Muhammad Ali, 

      urged tolerance. 

      

<P></P>

Similarly, this week, U.S. Authorities have scrambled with messages 

      about the safety of air travel - even though Ronald Reagan Washington 

      National Airport has remained closed (it will open partially tomorrow). 

      And a number of experts have also started appearing on television telling 

      Americans their country is prepared for any biological attack, even though 

      other non-government sources warn the opposite is true. 

      

<P></P>

"We are an action oriented culture," Snow says. "We are not an 

      introspective culture. 

      

<P></P>

``And that's where the sloganeering and jingoism comes into play. 

      

<P></P>

``We are almost given a script and walking papers in terms of how 

      we are supposed to respond."
