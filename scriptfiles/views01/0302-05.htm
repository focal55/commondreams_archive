I RECEIVED a call recently, inviting me to a talk about the treatment of 

depression by a somewhat well-known psychiatrist. The presentation would be at 

an upscale restaurant. I could bring a guest and I would be paid $100 just for 

attending.

<P>  It's not uncommon for pharmaceutical companies to sponsor such events. A 

child psychiatrist, I have been offered tickets to Giants and 49ers games -- 

and to a sailing weekend on Monterey Bay (guest welcome).

</P>

<P>  While my colleagues in pediatrics sometimes receive free lunches at 

hospital events sponsored by these companies, their freebies pale next to 

those offered to psychiatrists. Of course, the psychiatric pharmacopoeia is 

much more lucrative to drug companies than the routine medications 

pediatricians normally presribe.

</P>

<P>  In all fairness, most "detailers" (read salespeople) are knowledgeable and 

do provide, along with samples and gifts, various useful services. That is not 

the point. But the largesse of these companies as they bring us to the trough 

of knowledge needs to be compared with the actions of their management in 

other areas.

</P>

<P>  For example, the intensity of their concern for our health and safety is 

belied by a report that, despite FDA admonitions against using products 

derived from cattle in countries with mad-cow disease, some of the largest 

pharmaceutical companies were still using such ingredients in the manufacture 

of vaccines.

</P>

<P>  In the same week, we learned that the only highly effective drug widely 

used to treat the uniformly fatal African sleeping sickness was to be phased 

out of production. It was granted a reprieve only after the manufacturer 

learned that it could market the drug as effective in preventing facial hair 

growth in women -- surely not a problem that many Third World women fret over. 

(It needs to be used monthly at a cost of $50 per treatment.)

</P>

<P>  But the most scandalous position taken by these pharmaceutical houses, 

among the most profitable businesses in the world, is in their approach in the 

AIDs pandemic that threatens generations to come in Africa and South America. 

Already 17 million have died. Another 32 million adults and children are HIV-

positive in Third World countries.

</P>

<P>  The success of combination drug therapy against AIDS would be heartening if 

it were not for the fact that treatment costs $10,000 to $15,000 per year.

</P>

<P>  Appeals to drug companies to lower their prices are met with a litany of 

excuses. They make tiny discounts only after much publicity. Their officials 

say they can't cut prices because they need the incentive of great 

profitability in order to continue doing research.

</P>

<P>  When poor countries began to manufacture their own form of these drugs, 

pharmaceutical companies cried patent infringement. They donated huge amounts 

of money to both George W. Bush and Al Gore, and won support from both 

candidates.

</P>

<P>  Brazil, despite its economic problems, decided not to turn its back on its 

ill and impoverished populace. Relying on agreements that exempted the country 

from patents on drugs discovered before 1996, Brazilians decided to 

manufacture their own generic anti-retro virus drugs. Any infected Brazilian 

may receive the three-drug anti-HIV treatment free. Brazil and India, another 

defiant producer, are threatening the "social contract" that gives drug 

companies a 20-year monopoly on their discoveries and the right to charge what 

they want. In those countries, the cost per patient to manufacture the drugs 

is down to $3,000 a year -- with the promise of lowering the cost to $600 a 

year and, in the case of India, where this is being done by private companies, 

still make a profit.

</P>

<P>  Not only have Brazilians prevented an estimated half-million new AIDs cases,

</P>

<P>they have cut hospital costs by $424 million in 2 years.

</P>

<P>  Not included in these savings is the side benefit of preventing 

tuberculosis and other contagious disorders associated with AIDs.

</P>

<P>  It was argued that Third World patients would not be able to adhere to the 

strict regimen required for this treatment. But, in fact, Brazilians exactly 

matched the compliance record of natives of San Diego.

</P>

<P>  Drug company officials say poor profits would have a chilling effect on 

future research. And it's true that advances in parmacology in recent years 

have been prodigious. In psychiatry, our ability to relieve the suffering 

caused by an array of mental illnesses has been enormously enhanced. But many 

of these discoveries have been made at the public's expense through research 

grants -- or in government labs, then licensed to drug producers.

</P>

<P>  There is, in fact, a law that allows the government to seize drug patents 

if the holders are not adequately addressing the public's needs. But I know of 

no case where this has been done.

</P>

<P>  An article in the New York Times by Tina Rosenberg estimated that, if we 

chose to make AIDS treatment available to all, much like Unicef's global 

system of vaccination, even at the low price of $600 per patient per year, it 

would take $3 billion a year to treat the estimated 5 million patients who 

need the drugs. Leaving the issue of how much profit is needed aside, these 

same drug companies spend $1 billion a year on promotional events such as the 

ones I have been invited to.

</P>

<P>  The detailers cost them another $5 billion. If all the doctors in America 

said no to free meals, pens, clocks, calendars, stickums and the like; if they 

paid for their own educational events and meals and asked that this $1 billion 

be spent to address the AIDs pandemic, that amount could pay for fully a third 

of the needs of the afflicted.

</P>

<P>  And if we physicians agreed to get our information about drugs from any of 

a number of Internet sites (where drug companies could advertise their brand 

names), we could actually treat the world's AIDS patients and, with the money 

left over, wipe out tuberculosis and maybe even malaria.

</P>

<P>  Wouldn't that be worth a sail on Monterey Bay?
