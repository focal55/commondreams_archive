The World Series provided a heck of a photo-op for George W. Bush 

when he threw out the first pitch one night, aiming at a large TV audience. 

For the most part, the game that followed was a pleasure to watch -- midway 

through a week that combined what's best and worst about major league 

baseball in an era of compulsive media spin.



         <p>Baseball may not quite be America's favorite sport anymore, but it 

still has plenty of emotional resonance. For that reason, politicians and 

corporations alike are eager to graft themselves onto the climactic games 

of the post-season.



         <p>The 2001 World Series attracted an abundance of the commercial 

hype that we've come to expect from pro sports, plus a gauntlet of 

patriotic imagery bordering on jingoism. The play-by-play included a steady 

flood of brand-name plugs -- "Budweiser, the official beer of Major League 

Baseball," the John Hancock "In Game Box Score," the "Nextel Call to the 

Bullpen" -- along with frequent overlays of Old Glory.



         <p>This time around, the final games of the baseball season took 

place in a wartime flag-waving context. The historic media moment was 

captured by a frequently seen Wranglers commercial, which aired halfway 

through the seventh inning on the night that President Bush got his 

photo-op at Yankee Stadium.



         <p>That jeans ad starts with the American flag on the screen and the 

well-known opening chords of Creedence Clearwater Revival's song "Fortunate 

Son." Moments later, the lyrics begin: "Some folks are born, made to wave 

the flag / Ooh, they're red, white and blue..."



         <p>But then -- suddenly -- the soundtrack of the song drops out of 

the commercial. No more words can be heard after "red, white and blue." The 

next lines are missing: "And when the band plays 'Hail to the Chief' / They 

point the cannon right at you."



         <p>There you have it, in miniature -- a convergence of corporate 

shilling and ultra-nationalism that can splice up a song precisely enough 

to turn the selection into the opposite of the song's meaning.



         <p>"Fortunate Son" is a raging denunciation of the kind of USA Number 

One militaristic fervor that has swept America, with privileged elites 

leading the cheers for war: "It ain't me, I ain't no senator's son ... It 

ain't me, I ain't no fortunate one..."



         <p>Despite the incessant commercialism and recent hyper-patriotism 

surrounding it, pro baseball retains a lot of genuine resiliency. It's the 

most pensive of team sports, and the close-up camera work of modern-day 

television is able to provide coverage that explores human dimensions well 

beyond just physical skill. The ball is actually in play for a grand total 

of only a few minutes per game -- according to one estimate, just five 

minutes from the first pitch to the last. That leaves plenty of time to 

ponder what just happened and mull over the next possibilities.



         <p>For many Americans, baseball is inextricably entangled with some 

of the fonder memories of childhood. And for people who grew up in the days 

of black-and-white television, the improvements are great. Back when ace 

pitchers Warren Spahn and Lew Burdette were dazzling World Series viewers 

in the late 1950s, watching baseball on TV involved peering at fuzzy 

figures that moved on a gray background. There was no instant replay then, 

and scant variety of camera angles.



         <p>Today, rendered on the TV screen, the game is somehow more 

personal as it unfolds. We routinely see artful camera shots of the faces 

of players on the diamond. As a sport that manages to be highly athletic 

and contemplative at the same time, baseball offers a measured pace and 

philosophical spaces that remain in sharp contrast to the frenetic energies 

of mass media. On the other hand, the televised games are damaged by the 

profusion of commercial plugs, logos and the like.



         <p>Hopefully, the essence of baseball will survive all the 

manipulation from corporate sponsors and symbol-hungry politicians. 

Especially in times of national crisis, we need to be alert. It's too easy 

this fall to passively consume television's melding of fervor for sports 

and war. The alternative is to think critically and fill in the blanks.



        <p> "Some folks are born, made to wave the flag / Ooh, they're red, 

white and blue / And when the band plays 'Hail to the Chief' / They point 

the cannon right at you."
