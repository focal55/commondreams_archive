PARIS -- The second term of Tony Blair's government has opened with policies emphasizing improvement of Britain's public services. How Mr. Blair promises to improve them merits some comment.

<p>

During his first term, he believed his mandate fragile and he sought to reassure the big centrist crossover vote from the Conservatives who had elected him. He did so by promising no tax increases during the life of the Labour Parliament and by promoting pro-business policies. His first genuinely new action was to make the Bank of England independent.

<p>

This program proved a success, contributing to his easy re-election this month. But his victory also owed much to the self-destruction of the Conservative alternative, which in office had wreaked havoc on underfunded public services by partly or wholly privatizing them.

<p>

Mr. Blair knows that he has to improve British railroads, education and health services, or he will lose the next parliamentary election. The outgoing Tory leader, William Hague, told him as much last week, saying Labour's argument that it needed more than one term to produce reforms would not work again because &quot;people demand delivery.&quot; Public services in some respects have worsened under Labour. The railroads, haunted by crashes and mismanagement, nearly collapsed. The National Health Service, semi-privatized by the Tories, who installed a costly bureaucracy of &quot;internal markets,&quot; has barely improved. The principal cause for the decline in Britain's public services is lack of funding, but transport, health and education were for years allowed to become bureaucratically rigid and decadent and, in the case of the railroads and schools, to be taken hostage by unions promoting their own corporatist interests. In Mr. Blair's proposals for change, however, one meets the same ideological conviction that produced Tory privatization. He says that if the public services can't be reformed, he will call in business to run them. This contemporary bipartisan belief that private business is automatically more efficient than public management is understandable, given Britain's experience, but it is put forward as something like a law of nature.

<p>

This is despite the practical evidence that the Thatcher and Major governments' privatizations made things worse.

<p>

The argument for business efficiency is plausible, in that the security of employment and diffuse accountability that frequently go along with public management contribute to waste, while competition inspires efficiency. The argument refuses, however, to acknowledge that the key variables are quality and intelligence of management and morale in the institution, not who owns it.

<p>

Mr. Blair does not propose privatizing the British Army or the Royal Navy. Well-managed public services have always existed. They used to exist in Britain. Mr. Blair today can look across the Channel and see what well-managed state railways can accomplish - indeed, what British railways once could have done.

<p>

The French rail system has an erratic record in labor relations but a brilliant one in efficient operations and the planning and execution of ambitious projects. Just this month the latest route in its high-speed TGV system opened, reducing to three hours what once was an overnight journey from Paris to Marseilles.

<p>

Even The Economist, which thinks the high-speed rail system an example of France's nationalized &quot;follies,&quot; concedes that the TGV network is &quot;comfortable, punctual and cheap.&quot;

<p>

The trains now link Paris and its main international airport to major French cities (and points beyond, through continuing service at reduced speeds) and to London, Geneva and Brussels. The system is being extended to Strasbourg, Milan, Antwerp, Amsterdam and on toward Barcelona, Madrid, Cologne and Düsseldorf.

<p>

It has been colossally expensive to build, but also has produced large economic and demographic benefits in linking the regions and bringing local businessmen and manufacturers into the national and international trading economies. No private investor or independent bank consortium, under modern market constraints, could finance such a project.

<p>

The French did it with state funds and government-backed loans, to be paid off over 50 years by a special company set up to own the infrastructure, charging tolls for each train that passes. The trains themselves are comfortably profitable.

<p>

It is, in short, a huge public interest project, intelligently conceived and financed. The state railways lost money last year because of labor trouble, mainly on the conventional rail network, but not on the TGVs.

<p>

The Economist is in many ways a sensible magazine, but it represents conventional British opinion in deploring the high-speed rail system as ideologically incorrect. It holds that France has to give up this kind of thing if it expects to have a proper modern economy and infrastructure. (Like Britain's?)

<p>

Mr. Blair's problem, though, is not with high-speed trains but with excessively low-speed ones, when they run at all. He would do well to throw off his ideological preconceptions when he thinks about how to improve public services.
