You've probably never heard of Pascagoula, Mississippi, but there's an international airport near there. It's named after the state’s senior senator and it's about an hour away from places you have heard of: Mobile, Ala., and Gulfport, Miss. 
<p>
According to <A href="http://www.jacksoncountyms.com/lott.htm" target="_new">its advertising</a>, "With rail access near the airport, Trent Lott International offers an ideal air cargo and inter-modal location." It's even planning to expand: "The airport is currently accessible to private and charter planes. Plans exist to overlay and widen the airport in the next five years allowing for the landing of commercial and commuter flights" 
<p>
You should know more about the Trent Lott Airport because you helped pay for it. The place got funding support from International Paper, Chevron and Shell, but it also received federal funding.
<p>
And as George W. Bush reminded us again yesterday, "The money up in Washington is not the government's money. It's the people's money." (That's what he told the people inside Harry S. Truman High School in Montana; there were crowds outside protesting, but the press didn't say what Boy George said to them. So it was the people's money that went to Trent Lott's airport -- and no doubt the rail access link as well. 
<p>
There may be a good reason why Pascagoula needs a direct air link to foreign nations. Federal funding for economic development is a fine idea. But today, on the five-year anniversary of the overhaul of the welfare system, it's a bit much to hear those never-been-a-single-mother Republicans harp on about evil "dependency" even as they rake in my money for their airports.  
<p>
Dollar for dollar, Trent Lott helps his state get way more back from Washington than his constituents pay in. According to the <A href="http://www.taxfoundation.org/pr-fedtaxspendingratio.html" target="_new">latest figures from the Tax Foundation</a> (a conservative anti-tax group), of the ten states that received the biggest share of money back from Washington, eight voted for George W. In the ninth state, New Mexico, Al Gore won by a hair. 
<p>
 Senator Lott's home state ranks third among the federal money-soakers. Mississippi gets $1.78 back for every dollar its taxpayers pay. Connecticut, by contrast, a Democratic state, gets the least in return -- just 64 cents. Indeed, across the nation, "tax and spend" Democratic states do plenty of taxpaying, but the big spending goes on in the Republican South. 
<p>
Five years ago, 75 senators and 256 House members said "dependency" was bad. On August 22, 1996, they voted the Personal Responsibility Act into law. Some of the leaders in the welfare overhaul are quite pleased with the result: "By any standard, this is a remarkably successful reform," Newt Gingrich <A href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/washdc/washphoto.htm" target="_new">told USA Today</a>. "Opportunity beats dependency almost every time in the American system."
<p>
It doesn't beat dependency in Trent Lott's Mississippi. In an age of military cutbacks, Mississippi's bases have been spared the knife. "During my leadership tenure, Mississippi has dramatically increased the attention we get from Washington, and I expect this trend to continue unabated," the Senate minority leader boasts to those who read <A href="http://lott.senate.gov/news/2001/0601.first.html" target="_new">his web page</a>. 
<p>
Getting money for their state from Washington is part of a senator's job. It's Lott's "personal responsibility," you might say. That's not the point. It's the hypocrisy when it comes to "dependency" that makes one sick. 
<p>
Welfare "reform" was never about reducing "dependency" on Washington per se. It was about freeing Washington from its responsibility for the millions of Americans that the big guys in D.C. don't care about. Those impoverished women and families who won't be using Trent Lott International Airport anytime soon.
