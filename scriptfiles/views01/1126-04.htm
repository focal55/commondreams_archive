NEW YORK -- I visited New York City for the first time since Sept. 11 and immediately 

traveled downtown to get a glimpse of ground zero.

<p> The scent was the first noticeable thing. Many people talk privately about 

this smell but they seldom acknowledge it publicly. It's not quite the gag-inducing 

smell of death but a muffled mixture of ash, chemicals and deep decay. An otherworldly 

mist hovers perpetually over this part of the city where, according to the latest 

figures, 3,682 people are dead or missing. If spirits exist, they'd be here in 

abundance.

<p> I was born and raised in New York City and--even from 900 miles away in my 

adopted Chicago hometown--I felt personally affronted by the terrorist attack 

on my former "turf." An insistent urge to return has been plaguing me since the 

attacks, but early November was my first opportunity to take the trip. I drove.

<p> Many of my New York-area relatives applauded the United States' military action 

in Afghanistan and, as readers of this column know, I disagree with that view. 

But after seeing the enormous damage, after standing on the fringes of New York's 

Tribeca neighborhood and watching people distracted by memories of unspeakable 

horror but valiantly living their damaged lives, it's easier to understand the 

anger of people nearer to ground zero.

<p> The dimensions of the tragedy are so immense, the loss of innocent lives so 

cruelly random; ground zero will forever be hallowed ground. Although New Yorkers 

are struggling mightily to bring this lower Manhattan neighborhood back to life, 

a profound sadness pervades the area.

<p> I felt some of that sadness earlier in the day while viewing the skyline from 

across the Hudson River in Weehawken, N.J. The colossal presence of the World 

Trade Center's twin towers at the bottom of the island helped balance the architectural 

density of midtown Manhattan. Absent the towers, the island looks unbalanced and 

adrift.

<p> That lack of balance seemed to be an overall metaphor for the city. I visited 

two academic institutions during my stay and emergency drills interrupted activity 

in both. Anxious folks piled out of the buildings rapidly, unsure if the alarms 

were drills or real.

<p> That anxiety was pushed up a notch by the crash of American Flight 587. It's 

surely a sign of the times when people are relieved to find that a plane crash 

that killed 268 people was the result of mechanical failure. The terrorism of 

Sept. 11 has given us all a new, worst-case scenario; relative to that, anything 

is a relief.

<p> The majority of the victims of Flight 587 were natives of the Dominican Republic 

or residents of Washington Heights, where most of the city's Dominicans live. 

But much of the media coverage focused on the Belle Harbor neighborhood of Queens 

where the plane fell. This disparity was noted by many of the city's Hispanic 

and African-American leaders and exposed some of the racial fissures that still 

plague the city even in the unified atmosphere of post-Sept. 11.

<p> The day before my arrival, the city organized a job fair to help those knocked 

onto the unemployment roles by the terrorist attack. This was the third one. New 

York has lost about 80,000 jobs due to Sept. 11 and the economic hit also has 

been unbalanced, walloping low-income workers much harder than others.

<p> Homelessness has soared to an all-time high according to the New York-based 

Coalition for the Homeless. Clyde Kuemmerle, of the Holy Apostles Soup Kitchen 

in Manhattan, told the Associated Press there had been a "dramatic" increase in 

the number of people seeking food relief since Sept. 11.

<p> Despite this disproportionate hit, Congress seems to be balking in advancing 

promised relief money to the city. On Nov. 14 the House Appropriations Committee 

rejected plans to allocate $10 billion in funding to help rebuild Lower Manhattan. 

Congress had voted for at least $20 billion in aid for New York shortly after 

the attacks but the White House will release less than half of that this year 

and promised more would be available at a later date.

<p> Instead of using expensive weaponry to pound one of the world's poorest nations 

into rubble, in a war against an oppressive regime that we helped create, couldn't 

the U.S. better channel resources to the city that took the biggest hit from the 

deadliest attack ever on our shores?
