As I was mining deep in the recesses of

<a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/">www.whitehouse.gov</a>,

I unearthed this gem:

<p>

Reporter:&nbsp; Does [bin Laden] have political goals?&nbsp; <br>

The

President:&nbsp; He has got evil goals.&nbsp; And it's hard to think in

conventional terms about a man so dominated by evil.

<p>

Is Osama bin Laden really the Lord of the Rings?

<p>

That question ran through my head for three hours, as I watched a

fellowship of brave warriors battle the forces of evil.&nbsp; Was I

watching The Lord of the Rings, or network coverage of the war on

terrorism?&nbsp; 

<p>

The villains have no political goals, for only human beings can have

political goals.&nbsp; These inhuman forces do evil simply for its own

sake.&nbsp; They are the cosmic principle of evil:&nbsp; dark, dark,

dark.&nbsp; You dare not think of them in conventional terms, lest you be

accused of taking their side.

<p>

All that stands between us and this implacable darkness is a small band

of ordinary guys doing extraordinary deeds in their unconventional

hit-and-run style.&nbsp; Always vastly outnumbered, they never lose a

battle and hardly ever a single life.&nbsp; Are they really that

good?&nbsp; Or is it just because they embody the cosmic principle of

goodness?&nbsp; Their devotion to honor, decency, and each other is

exemplary.&nbsp; And they invite us to come back to the theater next

Christmas to see them defend the oh-so-white city, where we all hope to

live peacefully ever after. 

<p>

If you have seen the movie and followed the war news, you can no doubt

extend the list of parallels.

<p>

This is dead serious.&nbsp; How many dead, in Afghanistan alone, the

Pentagon will make sure we never know.&nbsp; 

<p>

The president's job is to hide the fact that bin Laden does have

political goals.&nbsp; He wants U.S. troops out of Saudi Arabia, an end

to bombing and sanctions in Iraq, and no more U.S. support for Israeli

occupation of Palestinian territory.&nbsp; More broadly, he wants to curb

U.S. influence in the Muslim world.&nbsp; 

<p>

How many American lives are worth losing, to maintain our powerful

influence in the Middle East and throughout the Muslim world?&nbsp; If

that became a matter of public debate, the Bush administration and its

war might be in real trouble.

<p>

So the administration dehumanizes the enemy, casting bin Laden as the

dark prince of evil.&nbsp; Ronald Reagan called the Soviet Union “the

empire of evil.”&nbsp; But at least he admitted that the Soviets had a

political vision for which they waged cold war.&nbsp; Bush dares not even

go that far.&nbsp; He can only call us to a war against Sauron and the

evil forces of Mordor, a war with no end in sight.&nbsp; If we believe in

his mythic vision, we can not even begin to think about the political

issues involved.&nbsp; 

<p>

The shocking fact is that most Americans do seem to believe in it.&nbsp;

Have we watched too many movies pitting pure shining good against the

mindless metaphysical principle of evil?&nbsp; Is there a seamless

infotainment web stretching from Lord of the Rings to the nightly

news?

<p>

Or does the immense success of Lord of the Rings and all its imitators

point deeper, to the thousands of years that humans have told stories

about absolute good fighting absolute evil?&nbsp; The vast Christian lore

of God against Devil is only one corner of this much vaster, world-wide

legacy of myth and legend -- the same legacy that bin Laden himself draws

on so successfully. 

<p>

So far, at least, the lure of simplistic myth has worked for the Bush

administration like a charm.&nbsp; A mere hint that El Qaeda might have

political motives sets off panic alarms among the patriotic

citizenry.&nbsp; To raise any political question&nbsp; is to think about

the enemy in conventional terms; i.e., to treat them as human beings, not

inhuman orcs doing Sauron’s bidding.&nbsp; That thought would open up too

many disturbing doors in the public mind.&nbsp; Easier to call it

treason, set the mind at rest, and go to the movies.&nbsp; 

<p>

This is the peace movement’s greatest challenge.&nbsp; As long as the

enemy is cast as an inhuman force of cosmic evil, we can not raise public

consciousness about alternatives to war.&nbsp; The pro-war forces know

that and count on it to keep the war going.&nbsp; We must insist, over

and over, in every way we can, as loudly as we can, that the contest is

political, not mythic or metaphysical.&nbsp;&nbsp; The victims of this

war are dying in the real world, not the Hollywood dream factory. 

<p>

We can and should condemn the use of violence to gain political

ends.&nbsp; We can and should debate the validity of Islamist political

principles and goals.&nbsp; Many of us will wholeheartedly oppose

them.&nbsp; But first we must help to stop the killing.&nbsp; To do that,

we must insist that even the people whose principles and goals we most

oppose are human beings, not monsters from Mordor.&nbsp;
