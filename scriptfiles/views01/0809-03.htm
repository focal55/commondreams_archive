Maureen Reagan, who has died at age 60 after a bout with brain cancer, was a loyal Republican. But she was not a "Reagan Republican."
<p>A supporter of abortion rights and a prominent campaigner for the Equal Rights Amendment in the late 1970s and 1980s, she referred to herself as a "Republican feminist" and spoke frequently in the early years of her father’s presidency about the need for a bipartisan commitment to advancing the interests of women.</p>
<p>In 1980, even as she campaigned for Ronald Reagan’s presidential bid, Ms. Reagan was outspoken in opposition to a Republican platform that included planks opposing the ERA and a woman’s right to choose. Republican operatives, including close aides to her father, pressured Maureen Reagan to follow the party line on those issues, but she held to her view that passage of the ERA was necessary if women were to achieve full citizenship.</p>
<p>Recalling Abigail Adams’ admonishment to the founding fathers -- "remember the ladies" -- Ms. Reagan said, "(The authors of American Independence) knew exactly what they were saying when they said, ‘All men are created equal.’ We’ve been fighting that for 200 years now." And, she added, equality would never be given women by men. "Nobody has given us anything. We have worked for (progress) and we have earned it."</p>
<p>In the face of male domination of the political and economic systems of the United States, she argued, only an amendment to the Constitution would provide long-term protection for the rights of women. "If we don’t get the laws changed," she said, "then the society as a whole loses. We can no longer allow this to continue."</p>
<p>Ms. Reagan wanted a lot more than just the ERA. She called for reworking the English language so that generic titles such as "firefighter" and "police officer" would replace "fireman" and "policeman." And she argued that Congressional committees should be led by "chairs," not "chairmen."</p>
<p>History books -- which Maureen Reagan pointedly referred to as "herstories" -- needed to be rewritten, she said, "so that no generation is ever raised again" without an awareness of the accomplishments of women. And, she added, so that of new generations of women would dream of leading nations.</p>
<p>Ms. Reagan would have liked to be such a leader. She ran for the Senate from California in 1982, losing a primary race to future U.S. senator and governor Pete Wilson. Her feminism earned her few favors from fellow Republicans, even in the days when the California Republican party still included a substantial base of women’s rights supporters. Her father refused to back her candidacy and her uncle chaired Wilson’s campaign.</p>
<p>Despite her feminist bent and a generally more moderate take on most issues than that of her father's followers, Maureen Reagan was less than a liberal. When headed the U.S. delegation to a 1985 United Nations conference on women in Kenya, she faced intense criticism for seeking to narrow the dialogue in order to avoid addressing issues of race and class. One of her most outspoken critics at that conference, Angela Davis, circulated a petition demanding that Ms. Reagan respect all U.N. declarations on women’s rights if she was going to put herself forward as an advocate for full equality. Davis referred to Ms. Reagan as "the unfortunate daughter of the president."</p>
<p>Unfortunate of not, Maureen Reagan continued to attempt to steer her father and the her party away from the rightwing orthodoxy that would eventually open a huge gender gap along partisan lines -- with women voters trending dramatically toward the Democratic party. Ms. Reagan warned in 1983 that a perception of Republicans as opposing women’s rights would have the effect of "destroying the home base of Republican feminists."</p>
<p>About this, she was certainly correct.</p>
<p>"I plan to live until I’m 102," Maureen Reagan used to say, as she campaigned for the ERA. "And I plan to see women in the Constitution... If anyone wants to stop me, they’ll have to outlive me."</p>
<p>Her opponents within the Republican party did stop her, just as they have outlived her. Her death -- like the exit from the party earlier this year of Vermont Sen. Jim Jeffords -- robs the GOP of one more link to the moderate traditions that once allowed the daughter of a president to seriously refer to herself as a "Republican feminist."</p>
