            In the midst of the summer congressional recess, Congressman Bernie 

            Sanders asserted today that the United States needs nothing less than 

            a “political revolution” that will revitalize American democracy and 

            move the country toward social justice. 

            <p> “At a time when more and more Americans are giving up on the political 

              process, and when the wealthy and multi-national corporations have 

              unprecedented wealth and power,” Sanders said, “it is imperative 

              that we launch a grass-roots revolution to enable ordinary Americans 

              to regain control of their country. 

            <p> “ The tragic consequence of millions of low income and working 

              people losing faith in the ability of the government to respond 

              to their problems, is that today the United States has, by far, 

              the lowest voter turnout of any major country. Meanwhile, the rich 

              and multi-national corporations are pouring billions into the political 

              process and both major political parties. The obvious result is 

              that many candidates who are elected end up being more concerned 

              about pleasing their wealthy benefactors than representing the needs 

              of working people, children, the elderly or the poor. 

            <p> “It is no accident,” Sanders continued, “that while pharmaceutical 

              and insurance companies donate huge sums of money into the political 

              process, American citizens must pay, by far, the highest prices 

              in the world for prescription drugs. Those same companies and their 

              political donations ensure that the United Stares remains the only 

              industrialized nation that does not have a national health care 

              program providing health care to all. 

            <p> “The rich hold $25,000 a plate fundraisers for their candidates. 

              Why would they pay so much for a chicken dinner? The answer is, 

              they want access and special favors. It is no accident that after 

              raising more money from the wealthy for his campaign than any candidate 

              in history, President Bush and the Republican leadership passed 

              a $1.3 trillion dollar tax bill which provides $500 billion in tax 

              breaks for the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans. It is no accident 

              that, rather than raising the minimum wage, the President and congressional 

              leadership are providing billions in tax breaks and subsidies to 

              the major oil, gas and coal companies. It is also, sadly, no accident 

              that almost 20 percent of our children live in poverty, schools 

              throughout the country are physically deteriorating, college graduates 

              begin their careers deeply in debt and millions of working class 

              people are unable to find affordable housing. 

            <p> “We need a political revolution in this country,” Sanders concluded, 

              “one that will revitalize American democracy and move us toward 

              social justice. We should make every effort to achieve the 60-80 

              percent voter turnout that takes place in most European countries, 

              rather than the 36 percent who current estimates say will vote in 

              2002. Americans must – all Americans – enjoy a decent standard of 

              living, rather than having, as at present, the most unfair distribution 

              of wealth and income of any major nation. It is time for a political 

              revolution to revitalize American democracy and move the country 

              toward social justice. 

            <p> “Freedom and justice don’t come easy. As the great black abolitionist 

              Frederick Douglass said; ‘Power concedes nothing without a demand. 

              It never did and it never will.’ We can learn from Douglass, and 

              from many of our ancestors who like he fought against the slavery 

              inflicted on black Americans and the genocide and suffering perpetrated 

              on Native Americans. Americans fought for decades for a democracy 

              in which all people could vote, rather than just the rich and landed 

              gentry. Women struggled for a century before they could fully participate 

              in the political process. Working people fought for the right to 

              organize labor unions. 

            <p> “In my view, the major struggle that we have now is for economic 

              and social justice. Once again, Frederick Douglass anticipated the 

              need for struggle: 

            <p>"If there is no struggle there is no progress. Those who profess 

              to favor freedom and yet depreciate agitation, are men who want 

              crops without plowing up the ground, they want rain without thunder 

              and lightening. They want the ocean without the awful roar of its 

              many waters." 

            <p>We have the wealth and resources in this country today to end poverty, 

              make health care available for all, and provide the best education 

              in the world. We won’t accomplish those goals, however, unless all 

              Americans reclaim their democratic heritage by fully participating 

              in the political process: by using the power to vote and speak and 

              act for social justice.</p>
