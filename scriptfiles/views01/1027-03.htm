Oviodio Diaz Espino was working as a corporate lawyer at J.P. Morgan in

New York when he went to a Christmas Party in 1997. At the party, Diaz met

a movie producer, Webster Stone.  Stone noticed Diaz had a foreign accent

and asked him where he was from. Diaz said Panama. Stone asked Diaz who he

worked for. Diaz said J.P. Morgan.

 

<p>Stone excitedly threw his arms in the air and said -- "Oh my God -- you

are the man I've been looking for!"

 

<p>"Did you know that J.P. Morgan was the treasurer of Panama during its

first year of existence?."

 

<p>"Are you aware that the Republic of Panama was created in Suite 1162 of

the Waldorf Astoria?"

 

<p>Diaz was not, and was intrigued. Stone had been working on a script for

Robert Redford about how a group of Wall Street movers and shakers created

Panama.



<p>Garry Trudeau was writing the script. The movie project was eventually

dropped (too many villains, no heroes), but Stone turned over his files to

an amazed Diaz, who dropped everything and began investigating.

 

<p>Diaz spent two years with his head buried in records at the New York

Public Library, searching to confirm Stone's allegation that his country

was created by Wall Street.

 

<p>And confirm it he did. Diaz lays out the story in a new book, How Wall

Street Created a Nation: J.P. Morgan, Teddy Roosevelt and the Panama Canal

(Four Walls Eight Windows, 2001).



<p>Diaz's story is about a corporate hijacking of U.S. foreign policy, about

how corporate interests and government interests become so entwined that

you can't tell the difference.

 

<p>In a nutshell, this is what Diaz found:

 

<p>In 1900, a group of investors led by William Nelson Cromwell, the founder

of the "prestigious" New York law firm, Sullivan & Cromwell, and the

banker J.P. Morgan, created a secret syndicate of Wall Street financiers

and politicians to buy the shares of the bankrupt French Panama Canal

Company, which owned the right to build the Panama Canal, from thousands

of small shareholders throughout Europe. They invested about $3.5 million

and gained control of the company.

 

<p>The covert investors then spent the next three years getting the United

States government to buy the holdings for $40 million, the payment of

which would flow back to them. In order to do this, they first had to

defeat an entrenched Nicaragua lobby. Nicaragua was the preferred route

for the canal because of its two big lakes, and also because the French

had already tried to build a canal in Panama but had failed miserably.

 

<p>And the U.S. was already on its way to building the canal in Nicaragua.

The House of Representatives unanimously passed a Nicaragua canal bill, a

treaty was signed with Nicaragua, President McKinley had already signed

the bill, and the excavation had already began in Nicaragua. It was a done

deal -- until Cromwell arrived on Capitol Hill and began throwing money

around.

  

<p>Senator Mark "Dollar" Hanna, who was at that time the chair of the

Republican Party and probably the most powerful man in America, received

$60,000, at the time the largest donation to any politician.

 

<p>In return, Hanna began a campaign to build the canal in Panama instead.

U.S. policy was reversed, and in 1902, Congress decided that the Canal was

to go through Panama.

 

<p>Only one problem -- Panama was at the time a province of Colombia, and the

United States needed Colombia's approval to move ahead. Teddy Roosevelt

sent Cromwell, who stood to benefit financially from the deal, to

negotiate with Colombia. Colombia balked, demanding more money. Cromwell

decided to circumvent Colombia, and to instead get Panama to secede and

create it's own country -- which it did.

 

<p>"What is shocking about this part of the story is that Wall Street

planned, financed and executed the entire independence of Panama,"  Diaz

says. In effect, Cromwell and J.P. Morgan hired Panama's Jefferson and

Washington, a tale of intrigue that Diaz documents. Panama was declared a

nation, Cromwell negotiated a canal treaty with his cronies, and made off

with millions. (Or as Senator Samuel Hayakawa put it years later, "we

stole it, fair and square.")

 

<p>Last week, we called up a Sullivan & Cromwell managing partner here in

Washington and asked if the law firm had any reaction to the allegations

that the firm's founding father had engaged in such skullduggery.

 

<p>The partner says, "Well, David McCullough wrote a book about the Panama

Canal (The Path Between the Seas) -- take a look at it."

 

<p>Diaz says, "McCullough does not dedicate one page to the question about

the secret conspiracy and speculation by the Wall Street financiers."

 

<p>The Sullivan & Cromwell partner also asked us, "What is the relevance of

this story 100 years later?" We put the question to Diaz.

 

<p>"I want people to know a chapter in world history that brought down a

French republic, a Colombian government, created a new republic, shook the

political foundations in Washington with corruption and gave birth to

American imperialism in Latin America," Diaz says.



<p>"It was one of the biggest scams in history. And I believe that alone is

worth knowing about."
