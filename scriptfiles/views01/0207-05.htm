It is common knowledge that President Bush was not much of a student.

Although the facts of his lack of academic distinction--at Phillips Academy in

Andover, Mass., Yale University and Harvard Business School--are well known,

few people have stopped to ask a seemingly obvious question: How did someone

with mediocre grades get admitted to two of this nation's most prestigious

universities? With respect to Yale, the answer is plain. George W. Bush was

admitted to Yale because his father, George Herbert Walker Bush, and his

grandfather, Prescott Bush, were prominent alumni.

<P>

   Giving preferential treatment to the children of alumni is standard

practice at most elite institutions of higher learning. University officials

claim these "legacy admittees" strengthen their schools by creating continuity

across the generations and building a loyal alumni base. This justification

parallels the most commonly articulated defense for affirmative action in

minority admissions. But Bush and many of his supporters have expressed

skepticism--and in the case of U.S. Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft, outright

hostility--for affirmative-action policies for minority students while saying

virtually nothing about the affirmative help routinely given to alumni

children.

<P>



The president's admirers who oppose affirmative action for minorities might

try to avoid this uncomfortable analogy by offering a different justification

for Yale's decision. During the campaign, those supporting Bush typically

chalked up his academic difficulties to youthful indiscretion, emphasizing

instead his record in business and as governor of Texas. Judged from the

perspective of his post-graduation accomplishments, his defenders implicitly

assert, Yale's decision to admit the future president was a wise one.

<P>

   The empirical record, however, belies any attempt to distinguish the two

forms of affirmative action on the basis of post-graduation success. The

overwhelming majority of minority students who benefit from affirmative action

in university admissions also go on to become productive and public-spirited

citizens. In the most comprehensive study to date, former university

presidents William Bowen and Derrick Bok conclude that black students from

selective colleges and universities lead successful and rewarding careers that

parallel those of their white classmates. A recent study of the University of

Michigan Law School's minority graduates reaches a similar conclusion. Indeed,

the post-graduation success of minority students who neither enjoy Bush's

ready access to circles of power, nor the automatic assumption of competence

that still is attached to those who are white and male, suggests that

minorities actually get more out of their education than their white peers.

<P>

   Rather than seeking to distinguish affirmative action for legacies from

other practices designed to tailor admissions policies to meet university

objectives, Bush and his supporters would do better to ask what the success of

both kinds of affirmative action says about the predictive value of the

"standard" criteria used to admit all students. In the Michigan study, for

example, researchers found, with only one exception, no statistically

significant correlation for any student between undergraduate grades and

scores on the Law School Admissions Test and future income or public service.

The exception is the inverse correlation between test scores and public

service-- the higher a student's LSAT score, the less likely he or she is to

engage in significant public service. These findings suggest that law schools

and other educational institutions should re-examine their admissions

processes for all students.

<P>

   President Bush claims he wants to "leave no child behind" and to "improve

the tone in Washington." Minorities might take this effort more seriously if

Bush were to acknowledge forthrightly the role that legacy affirmative action

has played in his own life. Such candor would go a long way toward persuading

minorities that the president really intends to move beyond traditional

Republican rhetoric that brands any effort to aid minorities as preferential

treatment while ignoring advantages routinely given to those already in

positions of power.

<P>

   Similarly, Bush's pledge to leave no child behind would be more credible if

it were accompanied by an explicit promise that the Bush Justice Department

will, notwithstanding the views of Atty. Gen. Ashcroft, defend admissions

policies that ensure minority students have the same opportunity to succeed as

Bush was given when he was admitted to Yale.

<P>

   Should Bush yield to those on the right and attack affirmative action for

minorities while saying nothing about legacy admissions, he will reveal that

compassionate conservatism has almost nothing to do with practices that

promote diversity and everything to do with policies that protect the children

of privilege.
