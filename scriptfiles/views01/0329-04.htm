The campaign finance compromise that passed Wednesday in the U.S.

Senate would only deepen economic and racial inequality in the United

States. The contribution-limits amendment to the McCain-Feingold bill

would increase the gap between the rich and the poor and between whites

and people of color by doubling individual contributions that can be

given directly to candidates--so-called "hard" money--from $1,000 to

$2,000.

<p>The amendment, if it is allowed to stand in the final bill, would

adversely impact all Americans unable or unwilling to contribute large

sums of money to politicians or political parties.

<p>Perhaps because the Senate does not look like America, the amendment

overlooks important perspectives related to inclusion, participation and

representation.

<p>Some senators have asked: "Can we raise enough money?" Others have

asked: "Are we infringing on the 1st Amendment rights of the wealthy?"

Unfortunately, by pandering to the narrow interests of politicians and

those individuals who can make $1,000 contributions under the current

system--who make up less than 1% of the population--the amendment

overlooks the rights of all other Americans. In a privately funded

political system, those who make large contributions have special access

to politicians and to the leadership of political parties, and they

therefore determine to a much greater degree which candidates will be

able to run credible campaigns.

<p>Under the amended McCain-Feingold bill, wealthy individuals would be

even more important, and the less wealthy would be even less important.

Politicians would give even less attention to less wealthy communities

because they have much greater potential for financial support elsewhere.

<p>The contribution-limits amendment also has an adverse impact on people

of color. Due in part to past state-sponsored discrimination and to

intergenerational transfers of wealth, the net worth for white households

is eight times greater than that of African American households and 12

times greater than Latino households. These economic disparities have an

impact on the ability of people of color to make political contributions.

<p>In a survey of individual contributors sponsored by the Joyce

Foundation, a philanthropic organization, 95% of respondents identified

themselves as white, and fewer than 1% identified themselves as people of

color. A separate study conducted by Public Campaign found that residents

in minority communities are about three times less likely to make

contributions than other Americans. The same study determined that the 41

million residents living in minority communities give less money than the

700,000 residents living in the highest-giving communities, which are

predominantly white.

<p>These racial disparities in political contributions would only

increase under the amended McCain-Feingold bill.

<p>Real campaign finance reform would meet the Fannie Lou Hamer standard,

which is named after the legendary African American voting rights

champion who worked on a Mississippi cotton plantation for most of her

life.

<p>The Fannie Lou Hamer standard asks whether a proposed reform would

make the system more fair for someone like Hamer, a poor woman of color.

The now-amended McCain-Feingold bill woefully fails this standard. Just

like the poll tax, the larger contribution limits under the amended bill

only further shut out those in our society who are the most marginalized,

the most discounted and the most overlooked.

<p>The contribution-limits amendment also violates the inclusive spirit

of one person, one vote as established by the Supreme Court. Higher

contribution limits would move us further away from a democratic promise

that includes all Americans, regardless of race or wealth.

<p>As long as our democracy is based on money rather than our votes, our

government and laws will not reflect America's true diversity.
