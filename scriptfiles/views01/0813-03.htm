Men with big mustaches and women with deep peasant tans rolled into this bucolic town on their tractors yesterday to make a stand for French food and to condemn the United States' tariffs on Gallic delicacies. 
<P>Truffle producers, Roquefort cheese and foie gras makers, shallot growers and goat farmers were joined by a motley crew of anti-globalization campaigners who camped on the town's rugby pitch.  
<P>They have been called here by the man with the biggest mustache of all, sheep farmer-cum-globetrotting media celebrity Jos&eacute; Bov&eacute;. Two years after he and some like-minded campaigners from the French small farmers' union, the Conf&eacute;d&eacute;ration Paysanne, vandalized Millau's branch of McDonald's, the pipe-smoking activist has organized a mass rally outside the same burger joint.  
<P>Today the tractors will form a blockade outside McDonald's in what is intended to be a peaceful protest. Some 250 CRS riot police will be on hand, though Bov&eacute; - now a veteran of anti-globalization demonstrations in Seattle and Genoa - doubts there will be violence. 'Millau is not Genoa,' he said. 'There's no reason that there should be problems. This time we don't intend to put a foot inside McDonald's. The police will be here and we won't fight them.'  
<P>But with a town of 20,000 swollen for the weekend to nearly double that number by arriving protesters, Millau's police know they have to be vigilant.  
<P>The rally has been called to highlight the fact that in the two years since Bov&eacute;'s symbolic protest against what he called ' la malbouffe americaine ' (crap American food), small French farmers are still suffering from a 100 per cent US tariff imposed on delicacies such as foie Gras and Roquefort.  
<P>In 1999, Bov&eacute; was furious about this, not least because he makes Roquefort from his sheep's milk. But, more importantly, he recognized that the US - backed by the World Trade Organization - had slapped tariffs on European products in revenge for the European Community banning hormone-  injected US beef imports. At the same time in August 1999, a branch of McDonald's was being built in Millau.  
<P>Incensed by this symbolic inroad into la France profonde, which he regards as one of the last bastions against unwholesome agriculture, Bov&eacute; and some colleagues called the local police and warned them they were going to vandalize the restaurant. He was arrested as a result of his action.  
<P>Two years on, the US duty is still in force and French farmers are feeling the pinch. The Roquefort Makers' Federation claims its US sales have fallen by 30 per cent.  
<P>Yesterday, holidaymakers heading for the beaches of the South of France joined with arriving protesters to cause gridlock outside Millau, France's glove-making capital.  
<P>The town was dominated by talk of Bov&eacute;'s rally. Marc Dehani, the manager of the Millau McDonald's, had not decided whether he will open his restaurant today, but said angrily: 'If I do close, it won't be Bov&eacute; who pays my 50 employees.' Dehani said he met Bov&eacute; once. 'There was no reasoning with him. He has his ideas, full stop. It's not very democratic.'  
<P>Dehani defended McDonald's against Bov&eacute;'s attacks: 'We work as partners with French agriculture. We buy French, and serve one million meals a day.'  
<P>But for Bov&eacute; and his supporters McDonald's exemplifies the inexorable march of globalization and multinationals, with all their threats to the small producer.  
<P>'For me,  malbouffe means both the standardization of food - the same taste from one end of the world to the other - and the choice of food associated with the use of hormones and GMOs,' he says. 'The food industry regards the farmer as merely the supplier of raw commodities to meet the need of the manufacturers, rather than those of the consumer.'  
<P>These days Bov&eacute; spends most of his time campaigning against globalization and soulless agriculture rather than rearing his sheep.  
<P>Two weeks ago he was placed under investigation for allegedly libeling French animal feed makers, claiming they bought feed infected with mad cow disease from the UK. It is the latest in a long line of legal wrangles for Bov&eacute;, who has a 10-month suspended jail term hanging over him for destroying genetically altered plants in southern France.</p>
