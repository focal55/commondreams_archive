SAN FRANCISCO  - An FBI   spokesman confirmed on

Wednesday that the U.S. government is working on a

controversial Internet spying technology, code-named ``Magic

Lantern'', which could be used to eavesdrop on computer

communications by suspected criminals.

<p>``It is a workbench project'' that has not yet been deployed,

said FBI spokesman Paul Bresson. ``We can't discuss it because

it's under development.''

<p>The FBI has already acknowledged that it uses software that

records keystrokes typed into a computer to obtain passwords

that can be used to read encrypted e-mail and other documents

as part of criminal investigations.

<p>Magic Lantern reportedly would allow the agency to plant a

Trojan horse keystroke logger on a target's PC by sending a

computer virus over the Internet, rather than require physical

access to the computer as is now the case.

<p>Malicious hackers have been known to use e-mail or other

remote methods for installing spying technology, security

experts said.

<p>When word of Magic Lantern leaked out in published reports

in November, civil libertarians said the program could easily

be abused by overzealous law enforcement agencies.

<p>When asked if Magic Lantern would require a court order for

the FBI to use it, as existing keystroke logger technology

does, Bresson said: ``Like all technology projects or tools

deployed by the FBI it would be used pursuant to the

appropriate legal process.''

<p>Major anti-virus vendors this week said they would not

voluntarily cooperate with the FBI and said their products

would continue to be updated to detect and prevent viruses,

regardless of their origin, unless there was a legal order

otherwise.

<p>Doing so would anger customers and alienate non-U.S.

customers and governments, they said, adding that there had

been no requests by the FBI to ignore any viruses.

<p>The FBI set a precedent in a similar case by asking

Internet service providers to install technology in their

networks that allows officials to secretly read e-mails of

criminal investigation targets.

<p>While the FBI requires a court order to install its

technology, formerly called ``Carnivore,'' some service providers

reportedly comply voluntarily, while court orders are

relatively easy to get, civil libertarians argue.

<p>Given the hijacking attacks of Sept. 11, it is also

conceivable that the U.S. government would enlist the aid of

private companies to combat terrorism and help its war effort,

said Michael Erbschloe, vice president of research at Computer

Economics, which analyzes the impact of viruses.

<p>``In previous wars, including World War II, the government

had the power to call on companies to help; to commandeer the

technology,'' said Erbschloe, author of ``Information Warfare:

How to Survive Cyber Attacks.''

<p>``If we were at war the government would be able to require

technology companies to cooperate, I believe, in a number of

ways, including getting back door access to information and

computer systems.''
