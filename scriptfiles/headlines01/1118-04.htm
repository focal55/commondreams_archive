BARRE – If anyone was looking for proof that the <a href="http://www.progressiveparty.org/" target="_new">Progressive Party</a> has arrived

here in Vermont, they would have found it at the group’s state convention

Saturday.

<p>About 250 party faithful and interested newcomers packed the Old Labor Hall,

where they celebrated their major party status by holding proceedings that

had all the trappings of a Republican or Democratic convention.

</p>

<p>Split by a controversial resolution calling for an end to the bombing in

Afghanistan and criticizing the government’s policies in responding to the

Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, delegates ultimately voted not to take action

on the measure.

</p>

<p>“It was my idea,” said Carina Driscoll, a Progressive state representative

from Burlington who made the motion to table the resolution. “I didn’t think

it was smart for the state party to vote on a resolution that we were clearly

divided on.”

</p>

<p>Delegates supported an amendment by Jimmy Leas of South Burlington that

called for an immediate end to the bombing, but the debate on the resolution

quickly exposed differences within the party.

</p>

<p>Some called the resolution proper in light of the destruction and misery

that the war was bringing to many innocent Afghans. Others said its adoption

would send the wrong message to many of the blue-collar workers that the

party was trying to reach out to, who largely supported the government’s

actions.

</p>

<p>“I think what you will do is marginalize the Progressive Party in the eyes

of most Vermonters,” said Erhard Mahnke, speaking against the resolution.

</p>

<p>Anthony Pollina, who carried the party’s banner as a gubernatorial candidate

in 2000 and won nearly 10 percent of the vote, helping the party gain major

party status, said he supported the resolution but understood why there

were reservations about it, given its length and wording.

</p>

<p>He disagreed with the notion that the resolution might have marginalized

the party, or that Progressives were ducking a divisive question.

</p>

<p>“The Progressive Party has taken a lot of strong positions on a lot of issues,”

Pollina said. “… I think, if anything, people should respect the fact that

we’re willing to have the discussion.”

</p>

<p>Leas said he was “disappointed” by the move to shelve the resolution.

</p>

<p>“We already have two parties who support the war,” he said afterwards. “…

The Progressive Party, if it wants to provide leadership and govern, needs

to say … that this is not the way to do things.”

</p>

<p>It wasn’t the only issue that sparked a lively debate.

</p>

<p>Delegates turned down an amendment to the party’s bylaws that would have

given members who won statewide office or a seat in the Legislature a place

on the party’s Coordinating Committee. Some worried that would give Burlington,

where all four current Progressive House members hail from, too strong a

voice.

</p>

<p>And a platform plank supporting a hike in the tobacco tax as a measure to

curb smoking was likewise voted down after being denounced by some as an

unfair tax on the poor.

</p>

<p>But otherwise it was a day to celebrate the party’s achievements.

</p>

<p>Bob Miller, the party’s chairman, pointed out that Progressive committees

had been organized in 97 towns this year, up from 19 last year. And 13 of

the state’s 14 counties now boast Progressive organizations instead of three

or four.

</p>

<p>The party has raised nearly $100,000, Miller said, and has improved its

credibility and name recognition with organized labor and the public, largely

on the strength of Pollina’s run.

</p>

<p>“We have demonstrated the power of political action when people are bound

together by common principles and the commitment to government that improves

the everyday lives of its citizens,” said Burlington Mayor Peter Clavelle,

who now governs the state’s largest city and the Progressives’ power base.

</p>

<p>In another move that could have been taken from the Democrats’ play book,

Clavelle said there will be no fight between himself and Pollina over who

will seek what office next fall.

</p>

<p>“We’ll have a discussion and reach agreement as to the statewide candidates,”

Clavelle said after his speech.

</p>

<p>Both have been touted as statewide candidates, but neither publicized their

plans Saturday. Clavelle said he was considering a run for either lieutenant

governor or state senate, while Pollina said people were encouraging him

to seek the lieutenant governor’s and governor’s office.

</p>

<p>He hasn’t made a decision, he said, and didn’t think there was any pressing

need to. The Democrats avoided a primary battle when Lt. Gov. Douglas Racine

and Senate President Pro Tempore Peter Shumlin agreed to seek the governor’s

and lieutenant governor’s posts, respectively.

</p>

<p>The GOP faces a primary fight between State Treasurer James Douglas and

former Human Services Secretary Cornelius Hogan for governor. No one is

yet declared for the lieutenant governor’s slot, though Rep. Kathy Voyer

of Morrisville has been mentioned.

</p>

<p>Pollina sounded like a gubernatorial candidate as he gave an impassioned

speech that lashed out at both Democrats and Republicans, particularly Democratic

Gov. Howard Dean.

</p>

<p>He pointed out that the gap between rich and poor and cultural divides were

widening, adding that “… the only gap that gets smaller and smaller is the

gap between the Democratic and Republican Party.”

</p>

<p>Pollina blasted both as being in the control of moneyed interests; abandoning

commitments to families, the environment, and social justice; and for defining

political courage “as having the guts to cut programs that Vermonters rely

on.”

</p>

<p>“Let’s see how they respond in times of tight budgets,” he said. “By attacking

the most vulnerable in our communities with no real debate in a true spirit

of bipartisanship.”

</p>

<p>“It’s very exciting,” Joelen Mulvaney of Barre as she watched the convention.

“… I’m energized to see so many people interested in grassroots, Progressive

politics.”

</p>

<p>She said she hoped Pollina would make another run for governor.

</p>

<p>“We really need visionary leadership, people who are not only willing to

think about the future but are willing to act,” Mulvaney said.</p>
