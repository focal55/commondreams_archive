 The measure to be introduced in the House and Senate this morning will 
specify that organizations shall not be ineligible for U.S. aid "solely on the 
basis of health or medical services" they offer, as long as they don't violate 
the laws of the United States or the country in which they are being provided.
<P>  The legislation is aimed at overturning Bush's Jan. 22 executive order, 
which was among his first official acts as president. Under Bush's directive, 
organizations that offer abortions, or even mention abortions as an option 
during counseling, are ineligible to receive U.S. assistance.
</P>
<P>  Congress now allocates $425 million for international family planning, 
which is distributed among more than 400 organizations. Critics have labeled 
Bush's directive a "gag rule" that threatens the health of millions of women 
around the world.
</P>
<P>  "This is so outside the mainstream," said Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., of 
Bush's executive order. "It is cruel to women. It is backward. It is 
counterproductive. It will lead to more women dying."
</P>
<P>    Boxer is the author of the Senate measure known as the Global Democracy 
Promotion Act of 2001. Rep. Nita Lowey, D-N.Y., is offering a companion 
measure in the House.
</P>
<P>  The fight over international family planning funds has emerged as a 
linchpin in the larger battle over legal abortions and as a major source of 
conflict between Bush and Democrats.
</P>
<P>  Abortion opponents hailed Bush's action as evidence of his commitment to 
limit abortions, while abortion rights advocates warned that it was the first 
step in a broader campaign toward ending women's right to legal abortions.
</P>
<P>  The measure, to be introduced with great fanfare today, faces long 
legislative odds.
</P>
<P>  In the House, Lowey has about 40 co-sponsors, including four Republicans. 
Certain to be opposed by GOP leaders, the measure will likely be referred to 
the International Relations Committee, run by staunch abortion foe Rep. Henry 
Hyde, R-Ill. Democrats will need to resort to parliamentary maneuvers to even 
get the bill to the floor for a vote.
</P>
<P>  The prospects are brighter on the Senate side, where pro-choice senators 
hold a majority. Boxer has more than a dozen co-sponsors, including at least 
four GOP senators, according to her staff.
</P>
<P>  Sponsors hope that if they can get the matter to the full Senate for debate,
</P>
<P>the public will rally to their side.
</P>
<P>  "The more public awareness there is on this issue, and the more heat that 
President Bush takes for enforcing his policy, the better off we are," said 
Steven Biel, a spokesman for Population Action International, a family-
planning group based in Washington.
</P>
<P>  Biel conceded that the legislative prospects are not bright, but said: "The 
only other option is to wait four years and hope a Democrat wins. We're not 
going to wait four years and let women die."
</P>
<P>  Secretary of State Colin Powell, asked about the policy on ABC's "This Week,
" provided opponents some hope that Bush might reconsider when he suggested 
that he doesn't agree with the president.
</P>
<P>  "I have other views that are my personal views, but this is the policy of 
the government, and it's consistent with President Bush's campaign promises. 
And it is consistent with the principles of the party that he represents," 
Powell said on the ABC show.
</P>
<P>  The White House declined to return phone calls yesterday to discuss the 
legislation.
</P>
<P>  The bill's introduction today coincides with the first day that 
international family planning organizations will be permitted to compete for a 
piece of the $425 million pie.
</P>
<P>  U.S. law already prohibits the funds from being used directly for abortions.
</P>
<P>Under the new rules, groups that offer abortions or abortion counseling will 
not be eligible for U.S. funds to be used toward any purpose.
</P>
<P>  Biel and other critics of the Bush directive say it will make many 
organizations ineligible, and that scores of others may modify their practices 
to withhold abortions or abortion information to qualify for the money.
</P>
<P>  That, they say, will endanger millions of women, who are in need of 
abortions for medical reasons or who will seek out abortions under dangerous 
conditions.
</P>
<P>  Ironically, some women who rely on such organizations for birth control may 
find themselves pregnant and thus increase the demand for abortion, the 
critics contend.
</P>
<P>  "It is very dangerous for women to tie the hands of family planning 
organizations," Boxer said.
</P>
<P>  President Ronald Reagan in 1984 was the first to restrict the use of such 
international aid funds. President Bill Clinton reversed the ban when he took 
office in 1993.
