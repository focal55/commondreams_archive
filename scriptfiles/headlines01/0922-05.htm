PARIS   - The French, who know all about fighting and losing

distant wars, now fret over their maps of Afghanistan. And the word

heard repeatedly these days is ``piege.'' That is, trap.

<p>

	   France, solid behind America and fed up with terrorism, is ready

to fight again. But Frenchmen have learned the hard way that when

you go to battle for a principle, it is important to win.

<p>

	   From here, the picture is clear. Half of Afghanistan straddles

mountains over a mile high. Winter is coming. And the allies'

quarry is an elusive shadow of a man who survived in tunnels under

the noses of elite Soviet troops.

<p>

	   Europeans remember Britain's Afghan humiliation last century,

well before the recent war that eroded the Soviet Union's last

underpinnings. On this side of the Atlantic, many fear that

Americans won't take history to heart.

<p>

	   Charles de Gaulle warned John F. Kennedy not repeat France's

mistake in Vietnam. Now President Jacques Chirac, with more

subtlety but equal vigor, has urged President Bush to reflect

carefully on his options.

<p>

	   Europe heard with trepidation remarks on Thursday by U.S. Army

Secretary Thomas E. White, that the Pentagon  is ready to conduct

``sustained land combat operations'' as part of its promised war

against terrorism.

<p>

	   Afghans themselves have already bombed their country back to the

stone age. Almost anything worth protecting is underground. The

most radical fighters have little to lose: death in noble battle,

to many, is a ride to paradise.

<p>

	   The down side is harrowing. If television footage shows

Americans pursuing what Bush has already termed a ``crusade'' on

Islamic ground, sympathy for the calamity of Sept. 11 could slowly

sour into something else.

<p>

	   Muslims today number 1 billion across the world. The

overwhelmingly majority abhors terror tactics which blackens their

image and, in the view of most, run counter to the Prophet

Muhammed's Holy Quran.

<p>

	   But many Muslims are not certain how to assess a fast-changing

world, with bubbling conflict in the Middle East, in South Asia, in

North Africa and in the immigrant neighborhoods surrounding large

European cities.

<p>

	   An extremist fringe is hoping for, at the least, a humiliating

brier patch and, at worst, an ignominious retreat from an

unwinnable quagmire which could shift the real balance of global

power.

<p>

	   If Washington and its allies can exact punishment on terrorist

cells, they stand a good chance of stabilizing the balance among

Muslims, Christians and everyone else in a world badly in need of

such mutual respect.

<p>

	   At the same time, if they kill yet more bystanders and miss

their mark, they are likely to do the opposite.

<p>

	   This is what Frenchmen mean by ``un piege.'' In their view,

Osama Bin Laden figured this out masterfully. His terrible blow was

designed to goad Americans into striking out blindly, compounding

damage at a fearful rate.

<p>

	   The daily Le Monde, on Thursday, carried a front-page essay by

Gilles Kepel, a respected Arab world specialist at the Institute

for Political Studies in Paris. It was entitled, ``Le Piege.''

<p>

	   Bin Laden pursues a faster track version than classic terrorism,

Kepel argues. He is skipping the long, hard work of winning popular

sympathy. Instead, he seeks the spontaneous emotional reaction of

worked-up crowds.

<p>

	   To achieve this, Kepel notes, bin Laden needs to draw the United

States and its allies into an Afghan quagmire, with Muslim civilian

casualties steadily mounting.

<p>

	   ``Awaiting an offensive, (Taliban) Mullah Omar is calling for

the solidarity of all Muslims, as Saddam Hussein  did in 1991, and

he aims for total conflagration,'' he wrote. ``This is where the

conflict's destiny will play out.''

<p>

	   Islamic governments - even Iran and Sudan - have expressed a

will to isolate the Taliban, he noted, but broad populations have

yet to make up their minds. Here, he warns, is that trap.

<p>

	   ``It remains to convince the people concerned that the

eradication of talibans and their protege is the way to a more just

and unified world,'' Kepel concluded, ``and not a clash of

civilizations on which is based on apocalyptic terrorism.''

<p>

	   In one way or another, this is what most European strategists

are saying, especially in France and in Britain where old war

museums burst with lessons to be learned.

<p>

	   Call it war if you have to, they say, although many prefer a

less emotive term. But be sure at the start you can do what you

plan. Once begun, this will not be a clash in which any side can

simply declare victory and go home.
