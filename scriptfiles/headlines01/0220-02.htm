            Gaps in U.S. food safety regulations and enforcement and the dearth 
            of information about how "mad cow" disease spreads have raised questions 
            over whether American consumers really are insulated from the disease 
            that has caused the deaths of 94 people across Europe. 
            <p>While country after country in Europe has fallen prey to Britain's 
              mad cow epidemic, U.S. regulators have stood firm on their assurances 
              that Americans are safe, citing import bans, animal testing, curbs 
              on blood donations and feed restrictions. 
            <p>Although no cases of bovine spongiform encephalopathy have yet 
              been reported in the United States, and experts claim it is "highly 
              unlikely" that BSE will become a problem here, the same experts 
              concede that it is impossible to rule it out. 
            <p>"I don't think that any country can say they are 100% sure that 
              they are free of BSE," says Ralph Blanchfield of the independent 
              Institute of Food Science and Technology based in Britain. 
            <p>"I think it's reasonable that people are worried," says Stephen 
              DeArmond, a UC San Francisco neuropathologist who collaborated on 
              the 1997 Nobel Prize-winning research on the agent that causes BSE. 
            <p>Many food safety advocates are wary of government assurances in 
              the wake of the recent StarLink fiasco, in which a genetically modified 
              animal feed corn not approved for human consumption wound up in 
              everything from taco shells to corn chips. 
            <p>Though the risks of a mad cow outbreak in the U.S. may be slim, 
              there are concerns about gaps in these areas: 
            <p>* Feed mills. If BSE does exist undiagnosed somewhere in the nation's 
              cattle or dairy herds, there's a chance that it could be spread 
              by mix-ups at feed mills, some of which have been lax in following 
              regulations aimed at stopping BSE. The disease was spread in Europe 
              through contaminated animal feed. 
            <p>* Imports. American companies imported feed from Britain made of 
              rendered animals for three years after BSE was diagnosed there in 
              1986. Moreover, over the past decade, 32 cows were shipped in from 
              Britain that U.S. Department of Agriculture officials can't account 
              for. 
            <p>* Inadequate testing. Although 12,000 so-called downer cattle, 
              or cattle that could not walk on their own when they were brought 
              in for slaughter, were destroyed in the U.S. this decade and their 
              brains tested for BSE, some industry observers believe that is not 
              enough to guarantee that U.S. herds are free of the disease. There 
              is no test that can detect the disease in live animals. 
            <p>* Related diseases. Sheep, deer, elk and mink in this country have 
              contracted diseases in the same family as BSE known as transmissible 
              spongiform encephalopathies, or TSEs, which are not fully understood 
              and carry some of the same neurological symptoms. 
            <p>BSE affects the central nervous system of cattle and is known to 
              cause a human version called new variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, 
              which bores holes into the brain, causing bodily dysfunction, dementia, 
              hallucinations and death. 
            <p>Worldwide there have been about 178,000 cows identified with the 
              disease since it was diagnosed in Britain 15 years ago. The disease 
              has spread from Britain to native-born cattle in other European 
              countries, such as France, Italy, Switzerland, Germany, Portugal, 
              Ireland and Spain, through contaminated feed and been exported to 
              areas such as the Falkland Islands and Canada. 
            <p>It is believed to be spread by a mysterious particle called a prion, 
              an infectious molecule in the membranes of cells that is neither 
              a bacterium nor a virus and is largely found in the brain and spinal 
              cord of an infected animal. 
            <p>If BSE does exist undetected in this country's herds, the biggest 
              threat to the food chain would come from lax practices at feed mills. 
            <p>U.S. regulators have barred mills from selling cattle feed made 
              from meat and bone meal from BSE-susceptible animals since 1997. 
            <p>However, rendered dairy cows, sheep and goats are still used in 
              feed for pigs, a point that concerns some scientists, who fear that 
              the disease could spread to other species. They say the practice 
              leaves the door wide open for mix-ups such as the one at Purina 
              Mills in Gonzalez, Texas. 
            <p>There, the company acknowledged selling cattle ranchers feed made 
              from rendered cows, prompting a quarantine of 1,222 cattle. The 
              animals, which were bought and taken out of the food chain by Purina, 
              are not believed to have been infected with BSE. 
            <p>However, the incident highlighted how easily a contamination could 
              start and raised questions about the Food and Drug Administration's 
              ability to effectively police the food chain. 
            <p>It was cross-contamination like this that played a part in how 
              the genetically modified and potentially allergenic feed corn called 
              StarLink made its way into the food supply last year. 
            <p>To ensure that it was operating at "zero-risk," Purina vowed to 
              stop mixing meat and bone meal into all of its animal feeds. 
            <p>However, some of the nation's largest feed companies, such as Land 
              O'Lakes Farmland Feed and Cargill, still use meat and bone meal 
              in feeds for animals other than cows. 
            <p>And not all of them are using it responsibly, according to a report 
              issued last month by the FDA. In its inspections of more than 1,000 
              U.S. feed mills, the FDA found that 20% did not have the proper 
              precautionary statements on their labels. And 9% did not have a 
              system in place to prevent commingling of cattle feed with feed 
              meant for other animals. The report did not identify the violators. 
            <p>Five recalls have been issued for improperly labeled feed since 
              the 1997 ban, the FDA said. 
            <p>There are probably many more companies not in compliance. The FDA 
              has not yet finished its first inspection of all of the nation's 
              feed mills and renderers. It has no system in place for regular 
              inspections or sampling, says Stephen Sundlof, director of the FDA's 
              Center for Veterinary Medicine. 
            <p>Critics say the agency will also need to take a tougher stance 
              on enforcement to keep companies honest. Currently, offenders of 
              the ban are given an oral warning and a letter asking for a recall 
              before any product is subject to seizure. 
            <p>"It doesn't do any good to have regulations if you have no enforcement," 
              says Mark Ritchie, director of the Minnesota-based agricultural 
              think tank Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy. "These companies 
              should be [temporarily] shut down if they are violating the rules." 
            <p>Some food safety experts insist that because USDA officials acted 
              early to restrict imports and close in on potential problems, current 
              regulations should be sufficient to protect consumers and prevent 
              the spread of the disease. 
            <p>The U.S. has had a ban on live animals imported from Britain since 
              1989 and on animals, meat, bone meal and other products from affected 
              European countries since 1997. 
            <p>However, because some animal products were shipped over after animals 
              were diagnosed in Britain, the risk of BSE existing here cannot 
              be ruled out, Blanchfield says. "The U.S. imported just under [44,000 
              pounds of British feed] in 1989, when the epidemic started to get 
              going but was not at its peak." 
            <p>In addition to feed, the USDA keeps tabs on more than two dozen 
              cattle that were shipped in from Europe during the past decade and 
              still live on farms in Texas, Minnesota, Illinois and Vermont, says 
              the USDA's head veterinarian and mad cow expert, Linda Detwiler. 
            <p>So far, none has exhibited symptoms of BSE, and they are believed 
              to be too old to harbor the disease. 
            <p>However, some observers worry about the 32 cows shipped in from 
              Britain during the past decade that USDA officials still can't account 
              for. 
            <p>Academics say the risk to this nation's 98 million head of cattle 
              from fewer than three dozen animals is too low to even calculate. 
              "The risks of having a U.K.-like [situation] are infinitesimally 
              small" because of the feed ban, says George Gray, researcher at 
              the Harvard Center for Risk Analysis, which has studied the subject 
              for two years. 
            <p>It was the continued sale of feed made from the meat and bone meal 
              of contaminated animals that was responsible for BSE's rapid spread 
              across Europe, and that practice was promptly stopped in the United 
              States. 
            <p>Still, skepticism is understandable, scientists say, given how 
              much is not yet known about the disease. "We don't have the tests 
              yet to verify that there is no problem [in our herds]," says DeArmond 
              of UC San Francisco. 
            <p>A number of companies are rushing to come out with a blood test 
              that will detect the disease in live animals. Currently, the disease 
              is diagnosed only by studying brain tissue after an animal dies 
              or is killed. 
            <p>During the past decade, the brains of 12,000 so-called downer cattle 
              have been tested, and all tests have been negative, Detwiler says. 
            <p>Contributing to the confusion and fear is the host of similar diseases 
              affecting other animals in this country, such as deer, elk, sheep 
              and mink. 
            <p>Although these diseases have not been shown to jump species, scientists 
              can't say they haven't. And the experts can't fully explain how 
              the animals developed the cell abnormality to begin with. 
            <p>Two hunters in this country who ate deer and elk, and one non-hunter 
              who ate venison, have died from Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, Detwiler 
              says. There was no direct link established, however, because it 
              is not known whether they ate animals infected with TSE. 
            <p>Ritchie, the think tank director, argues that there hasn't been 
              enough education for hunters and additional precautions taken to 
              protect consumers. 
            <p>"Why government hasn't acted on what it's known is a very big question," 
              he says. "This is a direct threat, and it's not being dealt with." 
            <p>So far, cases of so-called mad deer disease have been identified 
              in wild animals in Colorado, Wyoming and Nebraska, and on 13 elk 
              farms in those states plus Montana, South Dakota, Oklahoma and Saskatchewan, 
              Canada. 
            <p>Regulators won their fight to wipe out the threat from the sheep 
              version of BSE, also known as scrapie, which was found in four animals 
              on a Vermont dairy farm. 
            <p>A federal judge ruled that the USDA can seize and destroy these 
              animals along with a second flock also imported from Belgium that 
              may have eaten contaminated feed. 
            <p>Scrapie-infected sheep ground up in feed are thought to be the 
              initial cause of BSE in Britain. So far, scrapie does not appear 
              to affect humans when ingested. 
            <p>Experts say consumers would have to feast on the brains and backbones 
              of cows to stand a significant risk of exposure to BSE. 
            <p>The prions causing BSE aren't found in muscle. There is also no 
              evidence that milk or blood pass on the disease. 
            <p>"I probably wouldn't worry too much about eating beef in the U.K.," 
              says Dean Cliver, a food safety professor at UC Davis. "And I certainly 
              wouldn't worry about it here."
