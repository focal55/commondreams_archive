Fears are growing for the safety of a kidnapped Indian-rights activist in violence-racked Colombia, whose dramatic testimony helped force Canada to change its policy on export-finance deals.

<P>Kimy Pernia Domico was abducted Saturday by three gunmen on motorcycles. Authorities said the three likely belong to right-wing paramilitary groups backed by landowners.</P>

<P>Mr. Pernia, 49, led the fight against the Canada-supported Urra hydroelectric project, which flooded thousands of hectares of land occupied by 2,800 Embera-Katio Indians.</P>

<P>In recent years, at least four Embera-Katio leaders have been killed along the Upper Sinu River in northwest Colombia, where paramilitary groups and leftist guerrillas are fighting to control territory.</P>

<P>Mr. Pernia is to tour Canada next month to speak about human-rights issues and address an international conference on water, July 5-8 in Vancouver.</P>

<P>More than 50 MPs have signed a letter to Colombian President Andres Pastrana demanding his release, according to the Inter-Church Committee on Human Rights in Latin America.</P>

<P>&#34;Now is the time to bring as much pressure as possible, so that the people who have abducted him know this is a mistake,&#34; said Bill Fairbairn, the committee's South America program director.</P>

<P>Mr. Pernia was seized outside a municipal office in the town of Tierralta, Cordoba province, 320 kilometres northwest of Bogota. The Bogota daily El Tiempo quoted witnesses who said he was handcuffed and forced to accompany the gunmen.</P>

<P>Soldiers arrested a 29-year-old man armed with a 9 mm pistol, who is suspected of taking part in the kidnapping, Colombia's Caracol radio said yesterday.</P>

<P>Mr. Pernia spoke in Quebec City in April at the People's Summit organized to protest plans for a free-trade deal of the Americas.</P>

<P>In November, 1999, he travelled to Ottawa to support Canadian activists' calls for closer scrutiny of the Export Development Corp., which provides financing and loan guarantees for Canadian companies doing business abroad.</P>

<P>The EDC had been heavily criticized for failing to consider the environmental and social impacts of projects it supports. It provided $18-million in loan support for a company that supplied construction materials to the Urra dam builders.</P>

<P>Mr. Pernia told the foreign affairs committee that the Urra project stood to upset the Indians' traditional way of life, based on river fishing.</P>

<P>This year, the EDC agreed to disclose information about proposals for projects that could harm the environment or cause social upheaval.</P>

<P>&#34;The government acknowledged the fact that we need to be transparent and open,&#34; spokesman Rod Giles said.
