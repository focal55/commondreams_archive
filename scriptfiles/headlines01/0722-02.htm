PORTLAND, Ore.  - The Oregon Democratic Party

endorsed on Sunday a drive to impeach five U.S. Supreme Court justices for the decision that gave George W. Bush the

presidency last year.

<p>The party's central committee voted overwhelmingly to begin

a campaign it hopes will take the issue to the U.S. House of

Representatives, which has the authority to impeach justices.

<p>The resolution passed Sunday by the 66 Oregon party

activists called for the ``immediate investigation of the

behavior'' of the five justices who voted to stop hand recounts

of Florida ballots.

<p>The decision gave Bush the majority of electoral votes and

the presidency. Then-Vice President Al Gore won the popular

vote.

<p>The justices who voted to stop the hand recounts were Chief

Justice William Rehnquist  and Associate Justices Antonin

Scalia, Sandra Day O'Connor, Clarence Thomas  and Anthony

Kennedy.

<p>``This is the first organized effort to advocate impeachment

of five justices,'' said former Rep. Charles Porter, 82, who

first raised the issue with Lane County Democrats and then

convinced the state party to adopt the resolution.

<p>Porter accused the five of ``egregiously bad behavior, high

crimes and misdemeanors.''

<p>Neel Pender, executive director of Oregon's Democratic

Party, said party officials would ask its congressional

delegation to begin investigating the matter. The delegation

has four Democratic House members and one Democratic senator.

<p>Neither the delegation or national Democratic Party

officials had any immediate comment.

<p>There has been no response yet from the high court on the

Oregon move, but the justices have defended the December

ruling. Recently, Thomas told a conference in St. Louis that

any suggestion of partisanship in the decision was wrong.

<p>``I think one of the ways our process is cheapened and

trivialized is when it's suggested we have a way to make

decisions that have more to do with politics,'' Thomas said.

<p>Oregon has long been known as a maverick state in U.S.

politics. It was the home of some of the earliest official

opposition to the Vietnam War and Green Party candidate Ralph

Nader  won 5 percent of the vote in the 2000 election.

<p>Only one justice has been impeached. In 1805, Samuel Chase,

survived a Senate trial after he was impeached on charges of

discriminating against supporters of Thomas Jefferson.
