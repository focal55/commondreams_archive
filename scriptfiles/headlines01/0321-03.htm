WASHINGTON  - Vice President Dick Cheney  said on

Wednesday his energy policy team was considering the future of

U.S. nuclear power and that new nuclear plants could help cut

greenhouse gases that cause global warming better than a

''seriously flawed'' Kyoto treaty.

<p>``If you want to do something about carbon dioxide

emissions, then you ought to build nuclear power plants. They

don't emit any carbon dioxide. They don't emit greenhouse

gases,'' Cheney said on MSNBC's ``Hardball'' program.

</table>President George W. Bush  in January put Cheney in charge of

a Cabinet-level task force to develop a long-term energy

strategy. Its recommendations were expected in about six weeks,

Cheney said.

<p>``A chapter in the report will deal with the nuclear

questions and whether or not we want to go forward, but no

decisions have been made yet,'' he said.<p>Cheney drew a contrast between nuclear power and the 1997

Kyoto global warming treaty to limit industrial-nation

emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, saying

the agreement was ``seriously flawed'' because it did not place

restrictions on developing nations such as China and India.

<p>The treaty was signed by the United States under former

President Clinton , but not submitted to the U.S. Senate for

ratification.

<p>``We do not support the approach of the Kyoto treaty,''

Cheney said.<p>``If you're really serious about greenhouse gases, one of

the solutions to that problem is to go back, and let's take

another look at nuclear power, use that to generate electricity

without having any adverse consequences,'' Cheney said.<p>No permits to build U.S. nuclear plants have been granted

since 1975, although nuclear power now provided about 20

percent of U.S. electricity, Cheney said.<p>The 1979 Three Mile Island nuclear accident, a near

meltdown of a Pennsylvania power plant that spread low-level

radiation over an area near the plant, put a long-term chill on

the industry.

<p>White House spokesman Ari Fleischer  said Bush did not

include increasing nuclear power in his energy platform during

his campaign. But he indicated Bush had not ruled it out in his

charge to Cheney's committee.

<p>``His charge to them was to look broadly and to look long

term,'' Fleischer said. ``We'll take a look at the

recommendations in their totality.''

<p>Bush last week retreated from a campaign promise to require

power plants to limit emissions of carbon dioxide. The European

Union  responded with concern that the act signaled a U.S.

retreat from efforts to fight global warming.

<p>Cheney said that Bush made U.S. opposition to the Kyoto

treaty clear in his decision last week on carbon dioxide.
