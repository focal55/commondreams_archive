WASHINGTON  - The World Wrestling Federation is

weighing a grudge match against the World Wildlife Fund, which has

won the first bout in a showdown over trademarks. 

<P>

The wildlife fund, known by the panda that is its logo and most

famous protégé, was founded 30 years ago. It sued the wrestling

federation, founded some 20 years ago, over use of the initials

WWF. On Friday, it won by a judge's decision in a London

courtroom. The wrestling federation said it plans to appeal the

ruling. <P>

Although the conservation group changed its name to the Worldwide

Fund for Nature 15 years ago, in the United States it is still

known by the original World Wildlife Fund. In 1994, it entered

into an agreement with the wrestling federation over the use of

the trademark initials. Since then, however, both have expanded

their presence on the Internet, where they have almost identical

web site addresses. <P>

As a result of the court ruling, however, the wrestling enterprise

will be allowed to retain limited use of its initials in the

United States only. It will be required to relinquish its prized

web site address. <P>

With the countdown now on to an October hearing to determine the

amount of costs and damages to be awarded, the wrestling

federation said in a statement, ''it is our intent to appeal the

judge's decision.'' <P>

''We do not believe there is confusion in the public's mind

between the World Wrestling Federation and the World Wildlife

Fund,'' it stated. 

<P>

The wrestling site, <a href="http://www.wwf.com" target="_new">www.wwf.com</a>, invited visitors Friday to ''win

a trip to Armageddon.'' The wildlife site, <a href="http://www.wwf.org" target="_new">www.wwf.org</a>, told

visitors, "Together, we can leave our children a living planet.'' 

<P>

The conservation group adorned its home page with pictures of a

rhinoceros, giant panda, tiger, and a pair of African elephants,

all apparently in repose. The wrestling home page was emblazoned

with images of such characters as The Rock and Undertaker in the

advanced stages of some form of rutting. <P>

Headlines on the wildlife fund's U.S. page included ''WWF Members

tell Congress: Save the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.'' The

wrestling federation's headlines included ''Emotions Explode on

the Road to SummerSlam.'' <P>

The wildlife site offered shoppers a plush ''special edition Giant

Panda that you can make yourself.'' One dollar from the sale of

each ornament would go toward efforts to protect pandas. <P>

The wrestling site offered shoppers a line of greeting cards,

announcing: ''You've seen all those other greeting card sites,

with the pretty little messages and awe-inspiring thoughts. Well

(expletive) that. It's time to send your friends some World

Wrestling Federation Attitude.'' The company prides itself on

providing family entertainment and some of its stars read to

children in libraries, so the text substituted symbols for an

actual expletive. 

<P>

The Switzerland-based wildlife fund argued in court that the

similarity in web site address was confusing and meant the

charity's donors could not make contributions with confidence that

their money would end up in the right place. The organization

claimed some 4.7 million supporters in more than 100 countries. 

<P>

The U.S.-based wrestling federation struck back, saying the

conservationists had acted to put the entertainment enterprise in

a commercial arm lock. The company reported revenues of 456

million dollars in the year that ended on Apr. 30 and said 2.5

million people attended its live events. It is listed on the New

York Stock Exchange, where its stock symbol is, to the chagrin of

its namesake, WWF. <P>

The judge hearing the case appeared to agree that the suit

represented a setback for the wrestlers' business but ruled that

the wildlife fund's fears were reasonable and that the

conservationists were within their rights. <P>

''We are pleased that the judge agreed with our position that the

World Wildlife Fund has acted to restrain our rights to trade,''

the wrestling enterprise said in its statement. ''However, we are

disappointed that the judge accepted the Fund's justifications for

these restraints without affording us a full trial and the right

to question the Fund on its need for these restrictions.'' <P>

Jerry McDevitt, an attorney for the company, was quoted in news

reports from London as saying that if the judge's ruling stands,

''all these millions and millions of fans - if the environmental

group had its way - would type in wwf.com, and instead of seeing

everything they've seen for years ... are going to be directed to

their site and learn about panda bears and whatever they're doing

to save the world.''
