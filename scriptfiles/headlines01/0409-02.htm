BUENOS AIRES  - The meeting of Western Hemisphere

trade officials to make progress towards the creation of the Free

Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA) took place in the Argentine

capital, which was practically under siege by heavily armed police

backed by armoured cars and police dogs on blockaded streets. 

<P>

   The security operations underscored Argentine officials'

anxiety about the potential for violence as members of civil

society groups and various political sectors came out in massive

numbers to protest the lack of transparency in the negotiating

process of the FTAA, a free trade area that would extend from

Canada to Chile. <P>

   The ministers entrusted with foreign trade from the 34 member-

nations of the Organisation of American States (OAS) wrapped up

two days of sessions Saturday at Argentina's Foreign Ministry,

surrounded by barricades and police decked in riot gear. <P>

</table>Beyond the security perimeter, meanwhile, the criticisms

launched by unionists, students, members of non-governmental

organisations (NGOs) and some of the region's politicians and

lawmakers against the bi-continental integration process grew

louder and more vehement. <P>

   ''There was widespread consensus among the negotiators,'' said

an Argentine foreign ministry official Saturday, about the need to

expand participation in the regional negotiations to include

representatives of civil society, and to provide greater

information to the public in general. <P>

   Nevertheless, the source admitted that the mechanisms to

facilitate such participation cannot be developed by the trade

ministers because it is up to the special FTAA civil society

committee, which would be responsible for organising information

campaigns and seeking its own financing. <P>

   The demands for social input in the process were expressed in

three massive street demonstrations in Buenos Aires, organised by

the major union centrals of Argentina with the heavy participation

of Brazilian, Paraguayan and Uruguayan activists. <P>

   Joining in the protests were union representatives from Canada,

Mexico and the United States (the member countries of the North

American Free Trade Association - NAFTA), who also took part in

discussion panels and seminars organised by economic sector. <P>

   Despite their strong presence, the protesters proved unable to

influence the trade negotiating process. And none of the region's

major political party leaders, legislators or business chiefs

participated in the various anti-FTAA events. <P>

   But civil society organisations are not the only ones lacking a

voice in the hemispheric integration process. <P>

   Last year parliamentarians from throughout the Americas

demanded in vain that their governments allow them to take part in

the trade talks in order to ensure their transparency. <P>

   But the governments' negative response still holds. The

negotiating authorities have already rejected a request presented

by a commission of lawmakers from the region to participate as

observers at the Summit of the Americas, to take place in the

Canadian city of Quebec, Apr 20-22. <P>

   At the Quebec City meeting, the Western Hemisphere heads of

state, with the notable exception of Cuba, are expected to approve

the foundations for the FTAA contained in the document negotiated

during the last week in Buenos Aires. <P>

   The bi-continental integration process came under scrutiny at

the World Social Forum, which met in January in the Brazilian city

of Porto Alegre. There, civil society leaders proposed that the

Latin American governments convene a popular referendum prior to

the parliamentary votes on the ratification of the FTAA <P>

   ''I don't think they'll accept the proposal because they know

that if they consult the public on the FTAA, the answer will be a

resounding 'No','' commented Víctor De Gennaro, president of the

Congress of Argentine Workers, one of that country's three leading

union centrals. <P>

   The labour leaders who organised this week's protests in Buenos

Aires made it clear that they are not protesting the capitalist

system, but are only asking to take part in the FTAA negotiating

process, and since they have been refused, they reject the process

entirely. <P>

   But the demonstrators taking part in the protests articulated

more radical opinions in their slogans and signs, especially in

criticising the hegemony of the United States over Latin America. <P>

   That line of thinking was conveyed most strongly by the

'Alianza Social Continental,' a regional network of NGOs, which

for the last year and a half has been demanding to see the content

of the FTAA negotiating documents in order to be able to monitor

and respond to the process and ensure that it is a socially and

environmentally viable project. <P>

   The only exception to the exclusion of civil society from the

years of trade talks is the Business Forum of the Americas, which

meets annually prior to the meeting of trade ministers. <P>

   The conclusions and recommendations arising from the Business

Forum are then studied during the initial sessions of the

ministerial meeting so that the FTAA negotiators are aware of the

private sector's priorities, and its areas of consensus and

dispute. <P>

   This year, when the approval of the document to launch free

trade in the Americas is at stake, the business leaders'

recommendations could not override the need for other

organisations - whether of workers, students, women, etc. - to

voice their demands. <P>

   The secrecy of the FTAA negotiation documentation is a serious

problem, warned the Argentine-born president of the Business

Forum, Antonio Estrany y Gendre, Friday. <P>

   ''All of the demonstrations against the integration process

would disappear if these documents were not being hidden,'' he

said. <P>

   Estrany y Gendre's statements won applause from the business

executives and trade ministers filling the auditorium, while

outside the Sheraton Hotel, where the conference took place, a

group of protesters threw rocks and Molotov cocktails at the

barricades and the police. <P>

   Argentina's President Fernando de la Rúa himself backed the

demands coming from civil society groups. <P>

   ''It is essential to disseminate (the FTAA discussions) so that

dissidence and opposition does not arise, because the strength of

this agreement lies in the conception of the region's peoples

supporting their democratically elected governments,'' he stated. <P>

   The president of the Inter-American Development Bank, Enrique

Iglesias, and OAS secretary general César Gaviria had expressed

similar sentiments earlier, exhorting the ministers and business

leaders to seek support from society for the integration process

by providing more information about and greater transparency in

the negotiations. <P>

   ''Otherwise the FTAA will not have social legitimacy,'' warned

Iglesias. <P>

   But the ministers insist on holding the talks behind closed

doors, thus fuelling the distrust felt by those who believe the bi-

continental treaty will bring nothing but misery to the region,

especially in the areas of social development, employment and

environmental protection. <P>

   The ministers voted down a proposal from the Canadian

delegation to make the FTAA negotiating document public. <P>

   Outside on the street, Jorge Silva, a leader of the Argentine

Federation of Truckers, told IPS he wondered if the ministers

truly think the FTAA will make it viable for Haiti to compete with

Canada, or Ecuador with the United States. So far, none of the

trade officials or business executives meeting in Buenos Aires has

addressed his concern. <P>

   Meanwhile, the organisers preparing for the Summit of the

Americas in Quebec City are rushing to set up cement blockades

around the meeting site and providing security passes for the

residents of the area.
