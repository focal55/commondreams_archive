SANTIAGO, Chile  - Chile's highest court on Monday

gave the green light to a judge wanting to question former

Secretary of State Henry Kissinger about the 1973 killing in

Chile of a U.S. journalist.

<p>Charles Horman, made famous in the 1982 film ``Missing,'' was

seized by troops in his home days after Chile's September 1973

military coup that brought dictator Augusto Pinochet to power.

His bullet-ridden body turned up at the morgue weeks later.

</font>Horman's family believes that Kissinger and U.S. Embassy

officials in Chile knew of his detention but did nothing to

obtain his release.

<p>Chile's Supreme Court said it would send a list of written

questions to Kissinger about the case through diplomatic

channels to U.S. legal authorities.

<p>Chilean investigating judge Juan Guzman had asked the court

to pass on the questions.

<p>``We order that the list of questions be sent to the

ministry of foreign affairs for delivery to the corresponding

court in the United States of America,'' a Supreme Court

resolution said.

<p>Sources close to the investigation said the questionnaire

aims to gather more details about the lines of communication

within the U.S. government on Chilean affairs in 1973.

<p>Horman's widow, Joyce Horman, has filed a lawsuit in Chile

against Pinochet and several other Army officers in connection

with the killing. She filed a civil suit in the United States

against Kissinger in the late 1970s, which was dismissed for

lack of evidence.

<p>State Department reports declassified last year show that

U.S. intelligence officials may have tacitly helped in Horman's

abduction.

<p>Horman was held in Chile's National Stadium, which became a

makeshift detention center for thousands of suspected leftists

rounded up by Pinochet's troops in the days following the coup.

<p>Pinochet is not likely to be prosecuted in the Horman case

since a Chilean court ruled earlier this month that he was

mentally unfit to stand trial, effectively blocking efforts to

hold him responsible for crimes committed during his 17-year

rule.

<p>Kissinger, secretary of state between 1973-1977, in May

refused a request by a French judge to answer questions about

the disappearances or killings of French citizens under

Pinochet.
