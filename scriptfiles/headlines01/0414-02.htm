The "McVeigh Special" is going for three bucks at a takeaway store down the road from the prison in Terre Haute, Indiana.

<p>It is a shish kebab, and it looks suspiciously like all the other greasy shish kebabs sold at the store every day. Except this one is "especially fried".</p>

<p>A little way along State Highway 63, directly opposite the prison where the Oklahoma City bomber, Timothy McVeigh, will be executed next month, Tom Norris has already leased a parking spot in his front yard to a television crew for $US1,000 ($2,000) a day.</p>

<p>"They've all been tellin' me it's morbid to make money out of this thing," he says. "Morbid, my ass! If those TV fellas want to go and pay me a thou' for parking in my yard, then I'm here to take it from 'em."</p>

<p>Mr Norris's son, Ronald, is building a sandwich wagon from which to sell food when the protesters, reporters and onlookers arrive for McVeigh's May16 execution.</p>

<p>Next door, Larry Taylor has rented the roof of his house to Rupert Murdoch's Fox TV network, so it can set up a Web cam for a 24-hour Internet broadcast of events in the jail compound before, during and after the event. </p>

<p>Around the corner, Matthew Worthington, a devout Mormon, says his five children will probably sell lemonade from their yard on the day.</p>

<p>"People will get thirsty, I suppose," he says.</p>

<p>Terre Haute's hotels have been sold out for months. All the rooms went for top dollar just hours after the date of the execution was announced.</p>

<p>Now locals are offering rooms in their homes for up to $US200 a night. Some will   throw in a "traditional Indiana breakfast" of ham and beans.</p>

<p>Terre Haute, an otherwise unremarkable industrial town, is proud of  its title of "City of Character". However, in recent days the town has displayed a jarring characteristic of modern America. In the land of opportunity, the birthplace of modern capitalism, no opportunity to turn a buck is beyond the pale.</p>

<p>But the town is not without a conscience. A spirited debate has raged for weeks between the various local churches over the morality or otherwise of putting a man, any man, even Timothy McVeigh, to death.</p>

<p>The participants in this cross-denominational discussion will be easy to spot on May16. They are the ones who won't be wearing the T-shirts that read: "I was there on McV day".</p>
