Palestinians sifted through the charred ruins of their homes yesterday after Israeli tanks prosecuting a deadly new policy of "preventative attacks" destroyed 10 houses, and buried one man alive beneath acrid-smelling rubble in this Christian town on the outskirts of Jerusalem. 
<P>Two weeks after the election of the hardliner Ariel Sharon, the Israeli army admitted yesterday that its soldiers are now taking a tougher line against the Palestinian uprising, now in its fifth month.  
<P>Israeli soldiers guarding checkpoints in the Gaza Strip are now allowed to fire warning shots at pedestrians, the local press reported.  
<P>In Beit Jala in the West Bank, a military spokesman said the army had decided "to hit before being hit".  
<P>For the people of Beit Jala, the change in the rules of engagement had a devastating effect. Tuesday night was punctuated by the wailing of children, and the explosive roar of tanks shells which pounded the town from Gilo, a Jewish settlement on the opposite ridge.  
<P>One man was killed, and at least 10 houses suffered direct hits. Some were home to extended families with nearly 20 members. "It was just boom, boom, boom," Hussein Shenaniri said, standing in what was once a kitchen. "I never thought we would get out alive."  
<P>An army spokesman said the shelling marked the first time in the Palestinian uprising that the military had initiated an attack on Beit Jala. It was, he said, a response to an escalation of the uprising following Mr Sharon's landslide election victory.  
<P>Mr Sharon's huge win ended the two-month ceasefire imposed on the commanders of Yasser Arafat's Fatah militia by local notables of Beit Jala, who were angry that the gunmen were bringing their people into the line of fire.  
<P>However, the army admits there was no firing on Tuesday night. Instead, it claims soldiers spotted gunmen who were preparing an attack.  
<P>"We don't want to be victims, and then wait and react," Lieutenant-Colonel Oliver Rafowicz said. "They were planning to open fire against us, and we identified them and opened fire first. We did not wait until they shot us: we shot them. You can call it a preventative attack."  
<P>The barrage started at about 8.30pm when the Korabi family was settling in around the television set. The lights went out, and at least 10 tank shells pounded into their first-floor flat, sending the family of 17 scurrying for safety.  
<P>Osama Korabi, 18, was hit as he tried to run down the front steps, and was buried under chunks of the outer wall, some 40cm thick.  
<P>When his family regrouped at about midnight, they located him by following the smears of crimson blood on the paving; it took more than an hour to dig him out.  
<P>Yesterday, his younger brothers were sifting through the charred and acrid-smelling ruins for whatever they could salvage. One plucked out his yellow piggy bank. "We only have the clothes we are wearing," Majdi Korabi, 22, said.  
<P>Col Rafowicz acknowledged that a Palestinian man had been killed in the attack.  
<P>"If he is an innocent man, I want to express my deep sorrow," he said. "But if the Palestinians want to continue the violence, then there will be a price to pay."  
<P>&#149; A British citizen was jailed for six months without trial yesterday on suspicion of plotting attacks by the Lebanese guerrilla organisation, Hizbullah.  
<P>Jehard Shuman, held since early January, has claimed to have been tortured. Independent doctors said he has suffered injuries consistent with physical mistreatment.  
<P>A statement from the office of Ehud Barak said yesterday that the Lebanese-born Mr Shuman had been plotting to carry out attacks inside Israel.
