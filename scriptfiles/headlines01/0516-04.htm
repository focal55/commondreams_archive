BEAVERTON, Ore. -- Three years ago, Nike chairman Phil

Knight stood before the National Press Club and told the world he

was so tired of labor-rights groups criticizing the athletic shoe

company he founded that he was going to personally make sure

conditions improved at Nike factories around the world.

<p>Knight has fallen short of his promises -- far short, in some

cases, according to a 105-page report released by the <a href="http://www.globalexchange.org/">Global

Exchange</a>.

<p>``During the last three years, Nike has continued to treat the

sweatshop issue as a public-relations inconvenience rather than as

a serious human rights matter,'' said Leila Salazar, corporate

accountability director for the San Francisco-based labor-rights

organization.

<p>Knight discounted the report, and said Nike has done more than

any other corporation in the shoe-and-clothing industry to make

sure workers are treated fairly. Knight said, the company has

promoted globalization of its work force as a way to lift wages in

many countries.

<p>``I think we've made significant strides, and I'm proud of what

the company's done over the last three years,'' Knight told The

Associated Press. ``It may take a while longer, but I do think it

will be understood that Nike is a good citizen in all the countries

that it operates in.''

<p>The report by the Global Exchange cited six promises Knight made

during a May 12, 1998 speech at the National Press Club in

Washington, D.C.:

<p>--All Nike shoe factories would meet U.S. Occupational Health and

Safety Administration indoor air quality standards.

<p>--The minimum age would be raised to 18 for Nike shoe factories,

16 for clothing factories.

<p>--Nike would include non-governmental organizations, or NGOs, in

factory monitoring, and the company would make inspection results

public.

<p>--Nike would expand its worker education program, making free

high-school equivalency courses available.

<p>--A micro-enterprise loan program would be expanded to benefit

4,000 families in Vietnam, Indonesia, Pakistan and Thailand.

<p>--Research and forums on responsible business practices would be

funded at four universities.

<p>But the report concluded that ``the projects Knight announced

have been of little benefit to Nike workers,'' or ``have helped

only a tiny minority, or else have no relevance to Nike factories

at all.''

<p>The report said that ``Nike workers are still forced to work

excessive hours in high pressure work environments, are not paid

enough to meet the most basic needs of their children, and are

subject to harassment, dismissal and violent intimidation if they

try to form unions or tell journalists about labor abuses in their

factories.''

<p>Knight said there might have been isolated cases of poor

management, but ``I don't think that's ever been typical of Nike

factories.''

<p>During an interview, Knight and two top managers noted that Nike

has contracts with factories that employ at least 500,000 workers

in more than 50 countries, so there are bound to be problems,

including cultural differences that shape management practices.

<p>Jason Mark, spokesman for Global Exchange, said the key to

solving many of those problems would be paying a ``living wage''

that allowed workers to save money, raise a family and move up to

their society's middle class.

<p>``Nike says they can't find a formula because it's different for

every country,'' Mark said. ``It's an assumption that's convenient

for them because it allows them to pay lower wages.''

<p>Dusty Kidd, vice president of corporate responsibility for Nike,

said economic need is important, ``but we've yet to really

understand how you can predicate a worker's pay based solely on

need and not on productivity.''

<p>``You've got to have productivity figured into how you pay

people, or you just don't make a product at a price you can sell

and make a profit,'' Kidd added.

<p>The Global Exchange report agreed with Knight on one point: Nike

has improved health and safety conditions at its plants.

<p>But the labor-rights group urged Knight to make some new

promises, including higher wages, independent factory monitoring

and support for unions.

<p>Mark, the Global Exchange spokesman, also said that stronger

regulation is needed for multinational corporations, whether it is

based on U.S. law or international law.

<p>``In the absence of U.S. government regulation on multinational

corporations, the only thing that's left is for citizens to police

corporations, and/or for the corporations to police themselves,''

Mark said. ``And we don't believe the corporations are policing

themselves.''
