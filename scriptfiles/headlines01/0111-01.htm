WASHINGTON  - Two environmental groups on

Wednesday raised concerns about a 1996 speech by

President-elect George W. Bush's designated interior secretary,

Gale Norton, in which she likened the struggle to preserve

states' rights to the cause of the Confederacy and said ``We

lost too much'' when the South was defeated in the Civil War.

<p>In the speech to the Independence Institute, a conservative

think tank in Denver, Norton, who was then Colorado's attorney

general, described slavery as ``bad facts'' that undermined the

South's struggle for state sovereignty.

<p>She also described her intention -- later dropped -- to sue

the federal government for forcing Colorado to add a wheelchair

ramp to the statehouse under the Americans with Disabilities

Act (ADA) of 1990, calling it ``a really ugly addition to the

state capitol.''

<p>The Environmental Working Group and the Community Rights

Counsel, in a letter dated Jan. 10, asked Norton to clarify her

positions, which they described as ``alarming.''

<p>They noted that the phrase ``states' rights'' had often been

used by ``extremist and racial groups with which we are certain

you have not associated and do not want to be associated.''

<p>``We remind you that 'states' rights,' an otherwise neutral

term, has been used as code over the years for a number of

dubious causes: the 'massive resistance' to school integration,

violence against environmental activists and government

environmental employees in the West, and the loosening of

strong enforcement of federal environmental protections,'' the

leaders of the two groups wrote in the letter.

<p>``Who is 'we' in the phrase 'we lost too much,' and what

specifically was 'lost' when the Confederacy lost and slavery

ended in 1865?'' they asked.

<p>Jeanie Mamo, a spokeswoman for Norton and the Bush

transition team, said Norton was making ``a strong case for

local and state rights'' in the speech, and did not intend to

express any sympathy for the Confederacy.

<p>She said the speech also focused on the 10th Amendment to

the U.S. Constitution, which grants to the states ``powers not

delegated to the United States.''

<p>Regarding the comment on slavery being ``bad facts,'' Mamo

said, ``What she's saying is that it's wrong, that clearly

slavery is wrong. That's a legal term.''

<p>``She absolutely believes slavery is wrong,'' Mamo added.

<p>Like other Bush nominees, Norton is not expected to

personally address the controversy until her Senate

confirmation hearing, which is scheduled for Jan. 18.

<p>Bush's nominee for labor secretary, Linda Chavez, withdrew

her bid on Tuesday after reports surfaced that she had

sheltered and possibly employed an illegal alien in the 1990s.

<p>Mike Casey, spokesman for the Environmental Working Group,

said it was crucial that Norton set the record straight about

her personal views and the remarks in the 1996 speech.

<p>``These are remarks she should promptly clarify. If she

leaves them stated as such, she is using the same code as a lot

of racist, extremist organizations,'' he said.

<p>He described Norton's speech as a ``jaw-dropper'' and said it

was particularly troubling, given the fact that she would be

heading an agency that employs more than 72,000 people,

including the Bureau of Indian Affairs, and is pursuing its own

diversity goals.

<p>If confirmed as interior secretary, Norton would also be

responsible for making federal park lands and facilities

accessible to people with disabilities, Casey noted.

<p>Moreover, he noted, the federal mandating equal treatment

for people with disabilities was signed into law by former

President George Bush, the father of the president-elect.

<p>If confirmed, Norton would also have substantial power to

decide how far the department should go in requiring states to

comply with federal environmental laws and rules governing

mining, drilling and grazing leases.

<p>The speech Norton gave focused primarily on her efforts as

Colorado attorney general to fight for states' rights, and she

described that fight as being long from won.

<p>``This is a battle where we are still very much in the

trenches in trying to make a difference,'' she said.

<p>In the speech, she recalled visiting a Civil War graveyard

in Virginia after a ``massive battle'' with the Environmental

Protection Agency over federal regulations, and said she was

taken aback by a memorial to ``all the Virginia soldiers who

died in defense of the sovereignty of their state.''

<p>``Sure, I had been filing briefs and I thought that was

pretty brave,'' she said.

<p>Noting that ``we certainly had bad facts in that case where

we were defending state sovereignty by defending slavery,''

Norton continued, ``But we lost too much. We lost the idea that

the states were to stand against the federal government gaining

too much power over our lives. That is the point I thin we need

to reappreciate.''

<p>Asked about Norton's remark about the wheelchair ramp, Mamo

said it arose out of frustration that the federal government

had not allowed the state of Colorado to determine the

architecture of the ramp, and how it would blend in with the

design of the Colorado statehouse.

<p>``She believed there should be a wheelchair ramp, but the

state should decide the architecture of the wheelchair ramp,''

Mamo said.
