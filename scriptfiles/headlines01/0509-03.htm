PANAMA CITY, May 8  - Indigenous leaders from around the

world are gathered this week in the Panamanian capital, where they

have launched a global appeal to defend their traditions against

the imposition of mass culture they contend is inherent in the

globalization process. 

<P>

   Delegates to the First Millennium Conference of Indigenous

Peoples discussed in the Monday plenary session the progress their

communities have made in development since 1994, the year marking

the start of the International Decade of the World's Indigenous

Peoples, declared by the United Nations. 

<P>

   The approximately 200 native leaders also deliberated the

creation of a Permanent Forum on Indigenous Peoples within the UN

system, as well as the economic and cultural impacts of

globalization in their communities, and mechanisms to ensure

respect for indigenous rights. 

<P>

   Tuesday saw the reinforcement of the common stance the world's

native peoples will take at the UN World Conference against Racism

and Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance, to

take place this September in Durban, South Africa. <P>

   The delegates gathered in the Panamanian capital agreed that in

recent years a ''cultural and economic racism'' has gained

strength and is hurting the native populations' development

potential. <P>

   Chilean Mapuche leader, Aucan Huilcaman Paillama, explained

that this form of racism subjugates his culture with elements of

mainstream global culture and economic modes that only benefit

determined sectors of the population, and discriminates against

people who hold a conception of development that is closely linked

to the environment. <P>

   One example of this sort of discrimination is the exploitation

of forests or the drilling of oil wells in protected areas without

taking the views of the local indigenous population into account,

''leading to conflicts because our peoples have to defend

themselves against this kind of attack,'' he stressed. <P>

   Representatives from the Americas, Asia, Oceania, Africa and

Europe denounced that all regions of the world tend to follow a

single economic development model, one that does not encompass

protection of the environment, biodiversity or native peoples. 

<P>

   In the opinion of Marcial Arias García, of Panama's Kuna

Indians, this conference was organized with the premise that the

only ones who should comment on and propose solutions for the

problems of natives are native peoples themselves. 

<P>

   Arias García explained that one of the crucial aspects for

counteracting cultural and economic racism is achieving

recognition of indigenous peoples' rights to self-determination

and access to the benefits provided by the exploitation of natural

resources found within their territories. 

<P>

   ''Our peoples must be recognized as the exclusive owners (of

the) cultural and intellectual property'' encompassed by ancestral

knowledge, he said, because this would allow native communities to

fight, for example, such phenomena as bio-piracy and the granting

of patents on living organisms. 

<P>

   ''Governments must adopt policies that protect indigenous

intellectual and cultural property and the right to maintain their

customs, administrative systems and practices,'' stated the Kuna

leader. 

<P>

   He also asserted that the international community has to

recognize that indigenous peoples have suffered the same

experiences related to the exploitation of their cultural and

intellectual property and that they are capable of managing their

traditional knowledge themselves. 

<P>

   ''We are open to providing this knowledge to humanity as along

as our definition of it and control over it are protected'' by the

UN and by the international community, instead of national

governments which tend to be at odds with indigenous communities,

said Arias García. <P>

   ''The governments maintain a colonialist view of our peoples.

State, national and international agencies, in developing their

policies, must understand that we are guardians of customs and

knowledge, and we have the right to protect and control the

diffusion of that knowledge,'' argues the indigenous leader. 

<P>

   The First Millennium Conference of Indigenous Peoples has been

organized by Panama's Napguana (''core of the earth'', in the Kuna

language) Association, and sponsored by the Netherlands Center for

Indigenous Peoples (NCIV-Nederlands Centrum Voor Inheemse Volken). 

<P>

   Taking part in the weeklong meeting, to wrap up this Friday,

are some 200 indigenous leaders from around the world, UN experts

and representative of various international cooperation

organizations and agencies. 

<P>

   The native leaders gathered in Panama come from Australia,

Bangladesh, Bolivia, Botswana, Bhutan, Canada, Colombia, Chile,

Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, India, Indonesia, Kenya, Mali,

Morocco, Mexico, Nepal, Papua New Guinea, Peru, Rwanda, Russia,

Sudan, United States and the Scandinavian countries, among others. <P>

   The contributions made by the indigenous presenters and

delegates are to be assembled in a final document known as the

''Panama Declaration.'' <P>

   ''Many of the contributions will serve as a basis for the

Universal Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, a text

that has been discussed over the last seven years at the UN

without the governments being able to reach an agreement,''

pointed out Napguana Association president, Nelson de León.
