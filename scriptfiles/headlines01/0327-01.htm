DANNENBERG, Germany (Reuters) - A heavily guarded train carrying nuclear waste

has rumbled across Germany towards a showdown with thousands of environmental

activists who defied a massive police presence to protest along the track.

</table>Some 20,000 police mounted one of the biggest peacetime security operations the

country has ever seen, hoping to avert the running battles through fields and woodland

that accompanied the last waste shipments before they were banned in 1998.

<P>

<P> Carrying radioactive slag left from reprocessing in France of fuel rods from German

reactors, the train was due in Dannenberg, south of Hamburg, by Tuesday evening.

There its six armoured containers, known as Castors, were to be loaded on to trucks for

the short road trip to the Gorleben interim storage plant on Wednesday.

<P>

<P> One group of Greenpeace activists in inflatable power boats evaded police breached

security on Tuesday to protest on a rail bridge they said was too weak. Dozens were

detained after sit-ins at points along the tracks.

<P>

<P> Protest groups, the train, police and the media engaged in a game of cat and mouse

on Tuesday afternoon as the transport took unexpected routes across the heart of

Germany. It had crossed the French border under cover of darkness just before midnight

on Monday.

<P>

<P> Under pressure from France to ease a backlog of German waste at its La Hague

reprocessing plant near Cherbourg, German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder lifted the

transport ban imposed on safety grounds in 1998. About two cargoes a year are now

planned.

<P>

<P> Environment Minister Juergen Trittin, one of Schroeder's ecologist Greens coalition

allies and himself once a protester at Gorleben, called for calm. He sees the waste

shipments as an integral part of deal he struck with the electricity industry last year to

phase out Germany's 19 reactors by about 2025.

Special police forces arrest Greenpeace activists hanging from a bridge in Seerau near the northern German town of Dannenberg, March 27, 2001. Some 50 Greenpeace activists occupied the bridge to stop a nuclear waste transport of six helium-sealed Castor containers enroute to Dannenberg. The controversial shipment of spent nuclear fuel is expected to unleash major demonstrations on its way to a storgage facility in the nearby Gorleben dump some 20 km (14 miles) away from Dannenberg.

<P>

<P> But protesters say their aim is to make handling the waste so expensive that the

industry shuts down its reactors now.

<P>

<P> "The many protest actions that are accompanying the atom transport are a clear sign

that nuclear energy is not socially accepted," Veit Buerger from Greenpeace said in a

statement.

<P>

<P> 

Nearly 200 demonstrators were detained on Monday around Gorleben, where

organisers expect up to 10,000 to try to block the trucks driving the 25 km (16 miles)

from the Dannenberg railhead on Wednesday. Last time, police used water cannon.

<P>

<P> With no reprocessing facilities of its own, Germany sends spent fuel rods to France

where most of the uranium is recovered for re-use. The small amount of waste is

superheated into a form of stable glass which is sealed in metal canisters for disposal.

<P>

<P> Each of the train's six wagon-sized, white Castors -- the name is short for Casks for

Storage and Transport of Radioactive Material -- holds 28 such canisters and weighs

over 100 tonnes.

<P>

<P> The radioactive canisters will be kept in warehouses at Gorleben pending a decision in

several years time on their final disposal. One possibility is burial in a nearby salt mine.
