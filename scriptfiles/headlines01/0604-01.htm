WASHINGTON  - UN Secretary General Kofi Annan is

playing down fears that US pressure could exclude cheaper, generic

drugs from a new global initiative to fight AIDS.

</table>Annan, who spoke with journalists after addressing the US

Chamber of Commerce here Friday, said he was unaware of US

pressure to exclude generic treatments from the official

procurement list of the Global AIDS and Health Trust Fund,

announced recently at an African AIDS summit.  <P>

   ''We would want value for money and we would want to do it

(purchase drugs) as cost effectively as possible,'' Annan said.

''We will not exclude generic drugs.''   <P>

   The multilateral fund seeks annual contributions of between

seven billion and 10 billion dollars to address care, treatment,

and prevention of HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria. Commitments

from donor countries are expected at the UN Special Session on

HIV/AIDS in New York, June 25-27.   <P>

   Annan's words likely will upset multinational pharmaceutical

companies, which have sought to block generic competition in the

area of AIDS drugs.   <P>

   ''We believe the fund should not be used to import generic

drugs into countries that have intellectual property rights

laws,'' said Mark Grayson of the Pharmaceutical Research and

Manufacturers of America (PhRMA), a leading lobby group of US drug

makers. <P>

   Grayson highlighted South Africa as an example of a country

that, as a party to international intellectual property

agreements, should not import generics. <P>

   The Pretoria government recently won a major battle against the

industry when a group of drug firms withdrew a legal challenge to

new legislation granting the health minister power to import or

produce generic drugs.   <P>

   ''We believe we have already made a big contribution to AIDS

care by lowering our drug prices,'' Grayson said, referring to an

offer by five major drug makers to negotiate discounts behind

closed doors. Few sub-Saharan countries have taken up the offer. <P>

   Annan assured the business gathering that the global fund would

honour patent rights while at the same time expanding access to

cheap drugs to the poorest people. He provided no details on how

this would be done.   <P>

   The pricing war pits major brand-name drug manufacturers in

wealthy countries against and generic producers in countries like

India and Thailand, which have yet to endorse to World Trade

Organisation's intellectual property regime. <P>

   Generic manufacturers are selling copies of patented triple

therapy combination anti-retroviral drugs to African governments,

such as those of Cameroon and Nigeria, for 350 dollars per patient

per year. By contrast, brand name drugs fetch between 10,000

dollars and 15,000 dollars on the US market. <P>

   The UN has brokered a country-by-country programme under which

five major pharmaceutical companies are offering triple therapy

drugs to Kenya at prices ranging from 1,300 dollars to 1,600

dollars.   <P>

   According to the French non-governmental group Doctors Without

Borders, however, stringent conditions attached to the agreement

mean that fewer than 2,000 of Kenya's 2.3 million HIV-positive

people are able to benefit.   <P>

   The industry has long been charged with using the secret

country-by-country negotiations to extract conditions and impose

delays and limitations while obscuring price transparency.   <P>

   Paul Davis, an activist with Health Gap Coalition, an AIDS

treatment network, said big pharmaceutical companies have the

backing of the US government in their opposition to including

generic drugs in the global AIDS fund.   <P>

   Davis said US delegates at this week's governing board meeting

of UNAIDS, the Joint UN Programme on AIDS, made clear that the US

government would not compromise on generic drugs and would oppose

bulk procurement of drugs by the new global fund.   <P>

   How the fund will operate remains unclear but Annan said it

probably would be run by a small secretariat outside the UN, with

financial operations housed at the World Bank.   <P>

   ''Currently all decisions are being made in non-transparent

negotiations between the US, European Union and various UN

agencies,'' Davis told IPS. ''By the UN special session on

HIV/AIDS, most of the parameters and policies will have been

established, and will be announced to delegations.''   <P>

   Major commitments to the fund are expected at that meeting. The

US pledged 200 million dollars to the fund last month, becoming

the first country to do so, but its contribution has been

criticized as paltry compared to the magnitude of need.   <P>

   The Health Gap Coalition is pushing for the AIDS fund to be

permitted to purchase drugs and other health commodities at the

best world prices, regardless of patent status.   <P>

   ''Generic competition has been the lever that has driven the

prices of AIDS drugs down,'' Davis said. ''If they are excluded,

it would only serve the interests of pharmaceutical companies and

not the poor people who need the drugs most.''   <P>

   Patented medical products should also be available to poor

countries at or near marginal costs of production, through bulk

procurement, he added. Grayson, at PhRMA, disagreed. <P>

   ''Our members feel that each company should have the right to

negotiate the prices of each drug with each purchaser,'' he said,

highlighting industry fears that large-scale purchases through

competitive bidding would put downward pressure on patented drug

prices.
