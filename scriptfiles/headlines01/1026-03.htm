WASHINGTON  - Climate warming already is thawing ice  

in Alaska and disrupting annual cycles in the life of plants and  

animals in Europe and North America, according to two new  

scientific studies released Thursday. 

<P>

The studies, published in '<a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/" target="_new">Science</a>' magazine, add to the growing  

body of research providing anecdotal evidence that regional  

changes in climate, particularly increases in temperature, are  

causing glaciers to shrink, permafrost to thaw, and wildlife  

behavior to change. 

<P>

''You are never 100 percent sure but what seems clear is that  

these changes fit very well with a general trend of warming linked  

with human activities,'' Josep Penuelas, a scientist at the  

Autonomous University in Barcelona who authored one of the  

studies, told IPS. 

<P>

The findings were released just before international climate  

treaty negotiators are scheduled to meet in Morocco Oct. 29 - Nov.  

9. 

<P>

''An increasing number of studies now report changes in plant and  

animal cycles from a wide range of regions, from cold and wet to  

warm and dry ecosystems,'' Penuelas said in his peer-reviewed  

article, 'Response to a Warming World.' 

<P>

In the Mediterranean, the leaves of most deciduous plant species  

now unfold on average 16 days earlier and fall on average 13 days  

later than they did 50 years ago. From Scandinavia to Macedonia,  

researchers have observed a six-day shift to earlier leaf  

unfolding and a five-day delay in autumn leaf coloring over the  

past 30 years. 

<P>

Remote sensing satellite data further validate these ground  

observations, said the study. New data suggests that the growing  

season has become nearly 18 days longer during the past two  

decades in Eurasia and 12 days longer in North America. 

<P>

All the observed plant changes ''are highly correlated with  

temperature changes,'' Penuelas said. 

<P>

Insect, amphibian, and bird life cycle changes, according to the  

study, were also observed. Butterflies now appear 11 days earlier  

than in 1952 in northeast Spain. 

<P>

Frog calling, which starts when the weather gets warmer, has been  

reported to occur about 10 days earlier between 1990 and 1999 than  

between 1900 and 1912 in New York State. Surveys in Britain showed  

birds laid their eggs nine days earlier in 1995 than in 1971. 

<P>

These changes in animal and plant cycles could prove to be  

harmful, said the study, because migratory species could wrongly  

decide when to start spring migration. Species that migrate from  

tropical wintering grounds, such as south of the Sahel, to  

temperate breeding grounds, may arrive at inappropriate times and  

unsuccessfully compete with other wildlife. 

<P>

''Climate change may thus be a serious threat to species,'' it  

said. 

<P>

The second study provides a unique set of ''nontraditional'' data  

based on an 84-year betting contest held on a frozen Alaskan  

river. Known as the Nenana Ice Classic, people in the small remote  

town of Nenana, Alaska have been betting money every year since  

1917 on when a wooden tripod erected on the frozen Tenana River  

will fall through the thawing ice. 

<P>

Researchers at Stanford University compared the Ice Classic  

contest records with available climate data for the area and found  

that ice breakup occurs on average five days earlier than it did  

in 1917. 

<P>

Raphael Sagarin, one of the researchers who co-authored the study,  

told IPS that the article underscores the importance of amateur  

naturalists, hobbyists and indigenous peoples who have collected  

observational data on nature over long periods of time. 

<P>

From these records, he said, scientists now have many examples  

that show that the natural world has been responding to climate  

warming. 

<P>

''Amateur naturalists have been so important in our ability to  

understand how climate change has affected natural systems because  

scientists for the most part weren't keeping these data,'' said  

Sagarin. 

<P>

Most scientists believe that carbon dioxide and other heat- 

trapping greenhouse gases, emitted when oil, gas and coal are  

burned, are causing the gradual rise of Earth's air surface  

temperature. 

<P>

In January, an international group of scientists known as the  

<a href="http://www.ipcc.ch/" target="_new">Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change</a> (IPCC) predicted that  

the average surface air temperature of the planet would rise by  

1.4-5.8 degrees Celsius by the year 2100 relative to 1990. Average  

sea level worldwide is projected to rise by 0.09-0.88 meters by  

2100. 

<P>

The panel, in conclusions supported by the studies released  

Thursday, said many species of mammals, invertebrates, reptiles,  

birds, amphibians and insects already are being affected. 

<P>

Many natural ecosystems - including glaciers, coral reefs,  

mangroves, and polar regions - are vulnerable to these changes and  

some will be irreversibly damaged, it said. 

<P>

Hoping to slow the warming, representatives from hundreds of  

countries will meet in Marrakech next week to translate into legal  

text the agreement made in July on the Kyoto Protocol on climate  

change. This would enable countries to ratify the treaty and turn  

it into international law. 

<P>

In July, governments from 178 countries formally adopted a  

political agreement on the rules for implementing the Kyoto  

Protocol. The accord, named after the Japanese city where it was  

drawn up, calls for the 38 industrialized nations to reduce, by  

2012, their combined annual greenhouse gas emissions to an average  

of 5.2 percent below their 1990 levels. 

<P>

The European Union, Canada, Iceland, New Zealand, and Norway have  

said they will ratify the agreement while Japan has said it wants  

to see the agreement come into force by 2002. Australia and the  

United States - the world's leading emitter of greenhouse gases -  

said they would not ratify the treaty.
