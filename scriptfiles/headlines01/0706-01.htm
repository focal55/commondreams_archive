WASHINGTON <wbr>-- <wbr>Last month, when President Bush showed up in Sweden to explain his

reasons for dropping out of a global agreement on climate change, he

promised European leaders that he would not interfere with their efforts

to carry out the accord.

<p>But some European diplomats now say the administration appears to be

backing away from that promise and creating obstacles for countries still

committed to ratifying the 1997 Kyoto treaty on global warming.

</table>Last week, for example, during consultations on the Kyoto agreement in

the Netherlands, the U.S. delegation raised objections on four key

issues, any one of which could be enough to doom the treaty, according to

participants and observers.

<p>"It seems that they are trying to obstruct and delay the process, and

that's of course what we feared," said a European official who

participated in the talks.

<p>The dispute involves more than just diplomatic niceties: At stake is a

four-year effort to negotiate ground rules for a binding treaty to reduce

emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases that many

scientists believe are causing the Earth's climate to warm over time,

with potentially severe consequences.

<p>The true test of whether the Bush administration will try to stymie

the process will come in two weeks, when representatives of more than 100

countries meet in Bonn to try to wrap up negotiations on the Kyoto

treaty.

<p>International leaders involved in the process are warning the United

States, diplomatically, to butt out.

<p>"The U.S. officials will have the eyes of many countries watching what

they do," said Swedish Environment Minister Kjell Larsson, who has been a

leader in the Kyoto process. "I heard what they said. I can imagine that

it could be used to block [the treaty]. But I count on it that [U.S.

negotiators] will work as constructively as they promised they would."

<p>Proponents of the Kyoto treaty have feared for some time that the Bush

administration will work behind the scenes to discourage other countries,

particularly Japan, from signing the treaty. Those concerns were

heightened last weekend when U.S. Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham,

discussing Bush's summit here with Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro

Koizumi, said the Japanese government had joined the U.S. in opposing the

treaty. It had not.

<p>Although Bush rejected the Kyoto treaty as "fatally flawed," most

other participating countries appear determined to plow ahead. But it

will not be easy. The agreement becomes binding if ratified by countries

that together were responsible for 55% of all carbon dioxide emissions

from industrialized countries in 1990. The U.S. was by far the largest

emitter in the group, with a 37% share.

<p>Now that the U.S. has pulled out, the arithmetic has become

challenging. Losing Japan, with its 9% share, would make the Kyoto

agreement's prospects grim.

<p>Japan remains on the fence. The desire to maintain economic

competitiveness and relations with the U.S. make it difficult for Tokyo

to ratify the accord. But national pride--the treaty is named after the

Japanese city where it was crafted--and domestic support make it

difficult for Koizumi's government to reject it.

<p>International environmental groups worry that the objections raised by

the U.S. at The Hague suggest the Americans plan to impede the treaty.

<p>"It seems that the delegation is going against what President Bush

promised European leaders, which was not to obstruct other countries from

moving forward," said Jennifer Morgan of the World Wildlife Federation, a

mainstream international environmental group. "If the United States were

to obstruct, it would set negotiations back years and the solution to the

problem back years.

<p>"It would show," she added, "that the Bush administration has no

concern about the environment at all, if it's not only going to keep us

out of the treaty but the rest of the world as well."

<p>The U.S. delegation justified its intervention at The Hague by noting

that some provisions could set precedents for other international

negotiations and that other provisions could have an impact on the 1992

U.N. climate change convention, the Kyoto accord's parent treaty, which

Bush has said he supports.

<p>The U.S. delegation objected to the European Union participating as

one unit that shares the burden of reaching an overall target. Under this

"EU bubble," some countries could reduce harmful emissions more and other

nations could do so less, or they could even increase them, and the

entire EU could still be considered in compliance.

<p>The U.S. delegation also stressed that the key implementing

organizations of the protocol must not be dominated by representatives

from developing countries.

<p>A third objection called into question a mechanism for pressing

countries to comply with emissions targets by holding them responsible,

if they miss a target, for making much deeper cuts during a subsequent

commitment period. The U.S. argued that the penalties should not punish

countries that miss their targets but should merely help them reach

compliance.

<p>The U.S. also stressed that it wants to remain involved in

negotiations about providing funds to help developing countries control

greenhouse gas emissions. This move raised concerns that the

administration might attempt to block a plan to direct $1 billion a year

to developing countries for that purpose.

<p>Some European diplomats said that because of the etiquette of Kyoto

negotiations, under which decisions are made by consensus and not by

votes, the U.S. is welcome to voice its opinions though it doesn't intend

to endorse the outcome.

<p>"What people will think is a foul move is if they actively block the

negotiations in Bonn," said a diplomat from another European country who

is close to the negotiations.

<p>Eileen Claussen, who was assistant secretary of State with

responsibility for climate change negotiations under the Clinton

administration, said the U.S. can make a case for weighing in on issues

related to the underlying U.N. treaty, but not on the Kyoto accord

itself.
