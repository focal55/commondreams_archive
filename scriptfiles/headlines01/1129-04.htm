BERLIN   - The anthrax attacks in the United States

were probably the work of a member of a U.S. biological warfare

program, the magazine of environment pressure group Greenpeace

Germany reported Wednesday.<p>The magazine said its article was based on information from

a U.S. delegation source at the U.N. biological weapons

conference in Geneva that began last week. The attacks have

killed five people.<p>``The U.S. delegation believe it is an inside job... Their

members also have more information than has been made public,''

Kirsten Brodde, a reporter for the magazine, told Reuters.<p>The magazine said: ``It seems the attacker ... wanted to

force through an increase in the budget for U.S. research on

biological weapons.''<p>It speculated that the attacker, who used anthrax-laced

mail, had probably wanted to cause panic rather than kill

anyone.

<p>U.S. investigators have still not determined who was behind

the attacks, but Attorney General John Ashcroft has signaled

the authorities were inclined to believe they had a domestic

source.

<p>The attacks occurred in the aftermath of the September 11

suicide plane attacks on New York and Washington and prompted

initial accusations by President Bush that Saudi-born militant

Osama bin Laden may been responsible.

<p>Asked about the magazine article, an FBI spokesman

reiterated that investigators were pursuing a number of leads

but no arrests appeared imminent.

<p>A spokesman for the U.S. delegation in Geneva said he did

not have any information about the article.<p>The magazine is linked to the environmental lobby group and

shares its offices, but it said it was financially and

editorially independent.</P>
