RIO DE JANEIRO  - Environmental matters rank high on  the agenda of the World Social Forum, which from Jan 25 to 30 will  make Porto Alegre, in southern Brazil, the international capital  for those who seek to build alternative strategies for global  development.
<p>Delegates from non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and social  movements, politicians and trade unionists are to take part in the  meeting, known as the ''anti-Davos'' because it is the  counterweight to the options proposed by the World Economic Forum,  which annually draws corporate executives, financiers and  government leaders to a conference in Davos, Switzerland.

</font></font>The World Social Forum, meanwhile, involves leaders and groups  with links to the political left and centre-left, who are  attempting to build a broad, worldwide organization to take on  what they consider the ''exclusive globalisation'' process imposed  by the big capitalists who meet in Davos and to prove that  ''another world is possible,'' the theory adopted as a the  meeting's slogan. 
<p>
   In open opposition to Davos, the conference in Brazil is an  endeavour to define orientations and joint actions ''in the fight  against neo-liberalism,'' Miguel Rossetto, vice-governor of Rio  Grande do Sul and organizer of the forum on behalf of the state an  municipal governments, told IPS.
<p>
   The variety of interests, areas of activity, cultures and  doctrines of the participants does not bode for immediate,  concrete results from the ''anti-Davos,'' say observers, though  the world can follow the meeting's progress at  <a href="http://www.forumsocialmundial.org.br/">http://www.forumsocialmundial.org.br/</a>. 
<p>
   This is just a ''first meeting, with full plurality and a  variety of urgent matters,'' which will launch a process and make  progress in organization, Rossetto told IPS. The idea is to repeat  the meeting on an annual basis, coinciding with the annual January  meeting of the Davos forum.
<p>
   With origins dating back to the early 1970s, the Switzerland- based World Economic Forum unites the top 1,000 multinational  corporations of the planet and defines itself as an independent,  non-profit foundation that favors globalization, economic growth  and social progress.
<p>
   In Porto Alegre it will be possible to achieve consensus on  environmental issues as a starting point for joint action,  commented Jean-Pierre Leroy, of the Federation of Social  Assistance and Educational Institutions, a Brazilian NGO.
<p>
   Access to wealth and sustainability is one of the four thematic  pillars of the panels in which internationally known personalities  and political leaders will take part, a presence that will give  the World Social Forum some weight with the communications media.
<p>
   Porto Alegre will see the arrival of such luminaries as eco- feminist writer Vandana Shiva, of India, US linguist Noam Chomsky,  Danielle Mitterrand, president of the France Libert&eacute; association,  and the independence leader of East Timor and Nobel Peace Prize  winner, Jose Ramos Horta.
<p>
   In addition to the scheduled panel discussions, the event also  involves hundreds of workshops and small group discussions.
<p>
   Genetically modified products, patents for seeds and other  living organisms, the environmental impacts of globalisation, the  case of the Amazon, the ecological requirements of trade, water  demands worldwide and renewable energy are just some of the issues  that will be covered.

</font></font>Porto Alegre was chosen to host the anti-Davos forum because it  is a city that has been governed for the last 12 years by the  leftist Party of Workers, which has introduced such innovative  measures as the participatory budget, in which citizen assemblies  decide on public expenditures.
<p>
   In addition, it is the capital of Rio Grande do Sul, a state  led since 1999 by Olivio Dutra, who inaugurated a transparent,  grassroots governing model when he served as mayor, from 1989 to  1992     The nearly 600 NGO representatives who met last June in Geneva  decided to hold the forum in Porto Alegre also because of its  environmentalist tradition and the peasant roots of Rio Grande do  Sul.
<p>
   The 'gauchos,' as the state's residents are known, are pioneers  in the ''social ecology and humanist struggle'' of Brazil,  stressed agronomist Sebastiao Pinheiro, professor at the local  Federal University and outspoken critic of the widespread use of  agro-chemicals.
<p>
   Rio Grande do Sul is also preparing to become a ''territory  free of genetically modified organisms.''     But that is a decision ''of the unionists, farmers and  housewives, and not of the elite,'' because the local population  has recognized the risks of such products for years, Pinheiro  affirmed.
<p>
   The 'gaucho' government has called for a moratorium on the  planting of genetically modified seeds until they are proved to be  risk-free for the environment and for human health, Rossetto  pointed out.
<p>
   Rio Grande do Sul is also the birthplace of the Movimento dos  Sem Terra (MST, landless rural workers' movement), which in 15  years grew to cover all of Brazil and is known for its high-impact  actions, such as massive demonstrations and the takeover of  unproductive farms and of governmental buildings in order to drive  agrarian reform.
<p>
   At the Porto Alegre forum, the MST plans to propose a global  campaign that would ensure seeds are considered the heritage of  humanity, limiting their patenting and the threat that a handful  of transnational corporations monopolize seeds through bio- prospecting projects.
<p>
   The movement initiated a national campaign against transgenic  seeds, highlighting their risks for human health and the  environment as well as the damage they could inflict on food  security.
<p>
   Several transnationals genetically sterilize the plants,  forcing the farmer to ''buy new seeds every year at the price the  company decides,'' affirmed Joao Pedro Stedile, MST leader.
<p>
   Rio Grande do Sul's ''ecological farmers'' will take three  claims to the forum, announced their spokesman, Pinheiro.
<p>
   The first refers to discrimination against farmers in  developing countries by pressures from the chemical industry. 
<p>
  While the European Union adopted strict rules in 1991 for the  application of farm chemicals, in Brazil some highly toxic  pesticides were categorized as merely ''moderately dangerous.''     Transnationals export lower-quality products to the developing  South. As a result, 95 percent of agro-chemical poisonings occur  in these ''peripheral countries,'' affirmed Pinheiro.
<p>
   The farmers will also make demands against the environmental  certification of agricultural products, a service that requires  technology and as a result is almost always provided by companies  from wealthy nations.
<p>
   This certification process adds costs that cut into the South's  competitive ability on the world market and completely disregards  the ethics of the individual farmer and the relation of trust with  the consumer built over the years, a dynamic that by-passes  intermediaries, Pinheiro said.
<p>
   The third MST denunciation alludes to genetically modified  organisms, charging that these products enslave farmers to the  power of the corporate seed owners.
<p>
   Leroy and his NGO, in association with groups from Chile and  Uruguay, plan to hold a workshop in Porto Alegre about  sustainability and democracy in the Southern Cone of South  America. 
<p>
   The organizers intent to expand the bases of Mercosur (Southern  Common Market) and other integration projects in order to overcome  the limiting frameworks of the market and of international trade.
<p>
   It is essential, for example, to prevent ''an energy strategy  that is based on industrial consumption,'' which puts the people's  and the environment's needs in second place, Leroy stated.
<p>
   Integration based on complementarity and specialised production  sacrifices the small family farmer, taking jobs and alternatives  away from the population. Another consequence could be the loss of  biodiversity and greater energy consumption because of transport  over greater distances, warned the environmentalist.
<p>
   The debate about new routes for development has already reached  a certain consensus in surpassing the ''dichotomy between the  environment and society,'' at least in countries like Brazil,  where the ecological question is part of development plans, not an  end in itself, Leroy pointed out.
<p>
   In parallel to the panels and workshops, Porto Alegre will also  host a forum of governors, which is expected to attract 1,000  local-level authorities, a parliamentary forum, with approximately  500 participants, and the First Inter-Continental Youth Camp.
<p>
   Also planned is a global camp of indigenous peoples, where  participants will discuss traditional knowledge and their own  ethnic and cultural survival.
