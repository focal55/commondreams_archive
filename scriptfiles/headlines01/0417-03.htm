CANBERRA  - ''It's an important moment for global

political history. The future is green,'' Australian Greens Sen.

Bob Brown announced in opening the first Global Greens conference

just finished here. 

<P>

   While organisers were delighted with the success of the

conference that focused on the growing political force of Greens,

the future success of green politics hinges how it deals with both

the dilemmas of its success -- and the backlash of powerful

political forces it seeks to challenge. <P>

   With more than 1,000 members in parliaments around the world --

including 250 in national parliaments -- Greens are becoming a

major political force.  <P>

   Some 350 delegates from 70 green parties around the world

attended the Canberra conference, which ended Monday. <P>

   The embryonic network of green parties has been growing rapidly

in recent years, leading to the development of regional

federations.  <P>

   Over the last decade, regional networks of green parties have

evolved in Europe and the Americas. In 1998, the African

Federation of Greens Parties was formed and followed last year by

the Asia-Pacific Green Network.  <P>

   While the conference dispelled the notion that Greens are

mainly a political force in the traditional strongholds of the

environmental movement -- such as in Europe -- the success of

Greens becoming ministers in coalition governments is creating its

own problems.  <P>

   In Germany, the decision of the Green Minister for the

Environment, Jurgen Tritten, to accept nuclear waste from a French

reprocessing plant, dismayed the anti-nuclear movement he was once

a part of. <P>

   While the growth and diversity have bolstered the political

strength of the green parties, the main formal business of the

conference was negotiating a Global Greens Charter -- part

statement of vision and principles, part policy platform -- to

give the network of parties greater coherence.  <P>

   It also sought to create a global network of coordination among

green parties on key issues like climate change, for instance. <P>

   However, the adoption of the charter was not without its

tensions.  <P>

   One African delegate suggested the proposal that Greens be

bound to counter discrimination against homosexuals. But while was

popular in Europe, it would damage prospects for winning votes in

Africa.  <P>

   Others argued the draft charter should commit green parties to

the abolition of the World Trade Organisation, and not its reform.  <P>

   The delegate of the Greens Party of Brazil, Antonio Melo Viana,

felt the charter should be more ambitious. ''We should dream a

little more. Perhaps the draft charter is a little too diagnostic,

a little too timid,'' he told the conference.  <P>

   While the charter adopts the protection of human rights as one

of its central planks, green politicians were aware that the issue

is not an abstract one. Indeed, delegates from many countries were

under threat to their safety for advocating their views.  <P>

   In response, the conference launched the formation of the

'Green Shield', with green activists from democratic countries

assisting in the defence of green activists under threat in less

tolerant countries.  <P>

   Wangari Maathai, the founder of the Greenbelt movement in Kenya

and candidate in the forthcoming presidential election, was

recently imprisoned for opposing land clearing projects to protect

Kenya's forests. <P>

   ''The Greens have been put to the test and suffered in the

cause of their environmental work. Greens in prison and under

threat get a great source of encouragement when they know that

fellow Greens from around the world are supporting them,'' she

pointed out. <P>

   While the defence of human rights will be an essential

ingredient in allowing green parties to flourish, the structure

for broader cooperation among green parties has yet to be

resolved.  <P>

   Issues such as whether the Global Greens will establish a

secretariat and how a global structure can improve political

effectiveness without detracting from the role of the regional

federations has yet to be resolved. <P>

   The freedom to speak out is not the only hurdle to the growth

of green politics.  <P>

   One of the biggest single barriers to increased green political

representation are electoral systems that effectively prevent

minor parties from either getting candidates on the ballot, or

ever having the prospect of winning seats.   <P>

   ''Political reform is hugely important but you do not wait for

political reform before you take action. The Greens believe in

operating within the space that they have and creating more space

around them and advocating for political reform at the same

time,'' said Marian Coyne, the Scottish delegate and spokesperson

for the European Federation of Greens parties. <P>

   For many delegates, especially those unsure whether they should

develop a formal green party or continue as either independent

politicians or extra-parliamentary activists, the conference was

an inspiration on what green politics could achieve.  <P>

   ''I believe that what the Greens are doing all over the world

should be replicated everywhere. I have been talking with some

friends back home and we think that it is time for us to go

green,'' said Nmimmo Bassey, director of the Environmental Rights

Action in Nigeria. <P>

   For Bassey, the issues are simple: ''I believe my colour is

green -- whether you are black or white the colour of life is

green.'' <P>

   ''With globalisation we are concerned that we are becoming a

global village not for people but a global village for

transnational corporations who are using our environment as a

place for the extraction of resources, our human rights are not

respected,'' he said. <P>

   Can increased global coordination of green political parties

achieve anything? Perhaps what is possible was no better seen in

the request from a delegation of traditional chiefs of New

Caledonia for support in protecting their coral reefs from

proposed mining projects. <P>

   ''The reefs campaign will be fought in New Caledonia by the

Greens and the Kanak people and in France by the French Greens --

who are coalition partners in the French government and the

environment minister who is a Green,'' the New Caledonian Greens

spokesperson Didier Baron said at the conference here. <P>

   The traditional chiefs of New Caledonia, who were previously

marginalised under French colonial rule, were elated. For many

delegates, it was an illustration of the theme that ''green

politics is a whole new kind of politics''.
