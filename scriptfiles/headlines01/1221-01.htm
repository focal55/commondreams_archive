MONTPELLIER, France   - A judge sentenced militant French

farmer Jose Bove to six months in jail Thursday, but not until riot

police fired tear gas to force more than 100 of his supporters from

the courthouse.

<p>

	   The appeals court convicted Bove, a leading anti-globalization

activist, for his role in destroying a genetically modified rice

field in southern France in 1999.

</table></font>After the sentencing, a defiant Bove vowed to continue the fight

against genetically modified crops. He said he would lodge his

second appeal in the case, this time to France's highest court, the

Court of Cassation - a move that could keep him out of jail for up

to a year. Under French law, defendants don't have to being serving

sentences until all appeals are exhausted.

<p>

	   ``Today they've tried to weaken our fight,'' Bove told reporters

at the courthouse, in this southern French town. ``For us, this

combat will not stop ... and if they put us in prison ... the

battle will continue from behind bars.''

<p>

	   Opposition to genetically modified foods has been very strong in

France. Bove's Farmers Confederation has made the issue one of

their causes, threatening to uproot experimental fields of modified

food if the government doesn't destroy them.

<p>

	   The appeals court verdict followed a trial last month. In that

case, the judge handed down a lighter punishment: a 10-month

suspended jail sentence and a fine.

<p>

	   Judge Patrick Brossier delayed the verdict Thursday for about

two hours after more than 100 farmers from the Farmers'

Confederation disrupted the proceedings and refused to leave the

courtroom. Riot police moved in, pushing the protesters into the

courthouse lobby and finally expelling them from the building with

tear gas.

<p>

	   France's Human Rights League denounced the verdict and expressed

its ``solidarity'' with Bove.

<p>

	   Bove hit the media spotlight two years ago after he led the

ransacking in 1999 of a McDonald's restaurant near his home in

Millau, in southern France. Later that year, Bove and two others

allegedly destroyed more than 1,000 rice plants in a greenhouse

operated by Cirad, a research firm near Montpellier. The three were

convicted this past March.

<p>

	   All three appealed. The court handed down a six-month sentence

Thursday to former Farmers' Confederation member Rene Riesel and a

six-month suspended sentence to Dominique Soullier, a regional

spokesman for the group.
