<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->WASHINGTON  - The White House on Thursday rejected

a demand to turn over documents sought by Congress in an

inquiry into how the Bush administration's energy policy was

formed.

<p>Vice President Dick Cheney's spokeswoman, Juleanna Glover

Weiss, said the White House was confident in its position that

the General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of

Congress, did not have the legal authority to request the

information.

<p>The GAO had demanded the White House respond by Thursday or

face a lawsuit. Cheney has provided some information to the GAO

but not meeting records of President Bush's energy task force,

which was headed by Cheney.

<p>``We are confident in the strength and persuasiveness of our

position,'' Weiss said. ``The matter could end right now, but

that of course is up to the GAO comptroller general. We're

focused on securing much-needed energy legislation.''<p>The task force has been criticized for its closed-door

meetings and meetings with industry officials as it developed

the energy policy Bush unveiled on May 17. Bush called for

stimulating production of coal, oil and nuclear power as well

as conservation measures.

<p>GAO Comptroller General David Walker had been asked by

California Democratic Rep. Henry Waxman  and Michigan Democratic

Rep. John Dingell to investigate the work of the energy policy

task force.

<p>``Vice President Cheney continues to act like someone who

has something to hide,'' said Laura Sheehan, Dingell's

spokeswoman.<p>Congressional sources said that while a GAO lawsuit was a

possible next step, it was up to the GAO, which is the

investigative arm of Congress. The GAO had no immediate

reaction.<p>Critics have charged the administration did not include

environmentalists and other concerned groups outside the energy

industry in significant policy discussions.<p>In letters sent to the House of Representatives and the

Senate a month ago, Cheney argued the president, the vice

president and other senior aides needed the ability to have a

''confidentiality of communications.''<p>Cheney in June turned over records relating to the costs of

the energy task force, but the GAO sought additional records,

raising the possibility of taking the issue to court.<p>The agency sought names of people attending the energy

policy group meetings and of panel staff workers. It also

sought records of meetings that energy panel staff or Cheney

had with people to gather information relevant to the energy

plan.</p>
