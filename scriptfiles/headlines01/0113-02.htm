            AUSTIN -- Marvin Olasky won't be in Washington next Saturday when 

            George W. Bush becomes president, taking the oath of office on a Bible 

            used by his father at his inauguration and also used at the nation's 

            first presidential inauguration of George Washington in 1789. 

            <P>Mr. Olasky isn't one for big parties and hoopla. But the writings 

              of the little-known Texas professor -- ideas that would break down 

              the traditional barriers between church and state -- will be on 

              the lips of many members of the new Republican ascendancy, including 

              its leader.</P>

            <P>The phrase &#34;compassionate conservatism&#34; tripped off Mr. 

              Bush's lips hundreds of times during the campaign.</P>

            <P>It sounded, to most observers, like something aimed at appeasing 

              moderate voters.</P>

            <P>But to fundamentalist Christian conservatives, it signified the 

              beginning of a radical public-policy experiment, one that is neither 

              glib nor moderate.</P>

            <P>The phrase was coined by Mr. Olasky, a slight, tweedy man who teaches 

              journalism at the University of Texas and has become one of Mr. 

              Bush's most influential intellectual advisers.</P>

            <P>He did not hold an official position in Mr. Bush's Texas administration 

              and that won't change as the former governor moves to the White 

              House.</P>

            <P>But Mr. Bush is preparing to make the professor's ideas a central 

              part of his government.</P>

            <P>In short, compassionate conservatism is a taxpayer-funded mission 

              to allow religious groups to provide most government social programs, 

              allowing them to operate homeless shelters, drug-treatment programs, 

              pregnancy-counselling services, prisons and unemployment offices 

              -- even if their mission is to convert their clients to religious 

              faith.</P>

            <P>To opponents who charge that this will set social programs back 

              a century, Mr. Olasky pleads guilty. This, he says, is exactly the 

              point.</P>

            <P>&#34;Historically, what we've found is the most useful kind of 

              poverty-fighting is spiritual,&#34; he said in an interview yesterday 

              at his home in the hilly suburbs of Austin. &#34;If I've been any 

              use in this process, it's [been by] bringing up some history and 

              showing how in this country we knew how to fight poverty, through 

              compassion that's challenging and personal and spiritual. And we 

              forgot that in the 20th century.&#34;</P>

            <P>Mr. Olasky, like Mr. Bush, is a fundamentalist born-again Christian. 

              The two have shared ideas since 1993, shortly before Mr. Bush was 

              elected governor. Their last meeting was just last month.</P>

            <P>Mr. Olasky's book, <I>Compassionate Conservatism, </I>published 

              last year, contains a laudatory introduction by the President-elect 

              and a reprint of a campaign speech in which Mr. Bush promised to 

              bring religious groups into the government fold.</P>

            <P>&#34;In every instance where my administration sees a responsibility 

              to help people, we will look first to faith-based organizations, 

              charities and community groups that have shown their ability to 

              save and change lives,&#34; Mr. Bush said, adding that the greatest 

              hope for the poor is not found in &#34;reform&#34; but in &#34;redemption.&#34; 

              In other words, religious belief.</P>

            <P>In recent days, Mr. Bush has created an Office of Faith-Based Programs. 

              It likely will be headed by Stephen Goldsmith, a former Republican 

              mayor of Indianapolis who allowed religious groups to offer many 

              of the city's social services. Mr. Bush has promised to expand the 

              scope of a 1996 law that allows people to redirect tax dollars to 

              private charities and religious groups. He has stressed that those 

              programs will also be offered by non-religious organizations.</P>

            <P>Mr. Olasky and his followers believe that poverty is not caused 

              by a lack of money, but by a lack of moral values on behalf of the 

              poor. As such, they see welfare as a poor alternative to religion.</P>

            <P>&#34;When I've gone around and talked to guys who've been homeless 

              for a long time or are alcoholics or addicts, when they do come 

              out of it, nine times out of 10, in my experience, it's a religious 

              transformation,&#34; Mr. Olasky said. &#34;When you're thinking 

              about helping the people in the greatest need, then it doesn't happen 

              except through a type of religious transformation.&#34;</P>

            <P>Many Republicans and religious conservatives believe that the Office 

              of Faith-Based Programs should be just the beginning. Jesse Helms, 

              the Republican chairman of the Senate foreign relations committee, 

              said this week that foreign aid should be placed under the care 

              of religious organizations.</P>

            <P>All of this has raised the ire of freedom-of-expression groups 

              and constitutional scholars, who point out that the United States 

              was founded on the notion of a resolutely secular state. It is one 

              of the few major Western nations, along with France, whose Constitution 

              does not have a theological basis (mention of God in the Pledge 

              of Allegiance and the In God We Trust slogan on currency were added 

              just decades ago to differentiate the United States from Communist 

              countries.)</P>

            <P>&#34;This is on its face a kind of constitutional crisis. The merger 

              of church and state in the White House represents a terrible reversal 

              of the country's principles,&#34; said Barry Lynn, head of the Washington 

              advocacy group Americans United for Separation of Church and State.</P>

            <P>The U.S. Constitution's First Amendment, he notes, contains the 

              phrase &#34;Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment 

              of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof,&#34; and 

              the Supreme Court has interpreted this to mean that governments 

              cannot direct funds to religious groups.</P>

            <P>But Mr. Olasky and his followers believe separation of church and 

              state is based on a misinterpretation of the Constitution. In his 

              books, he offers a rereading of U.S. history in which such luminaries 

              as Thomas Jefferson and James Madison are replaced by more spiritually 

              minded early Americans.</P>

            <P>&#34;The government was meant to be secular in the sense of not 

              preferring any religion. That's what the First Amendment was all 

              about,&#34; Mr. Olasky said yesterday. &#34;The founders would have 

              seen what we've done to the public square not as neutrality, but 

              as nakedness.&#34;</P>

            <P>Mr. Olasky has devoted his life to extremes. Raised in the Jewish 

              faith, his political views became increasingly radical and isolated 

              at university. He joined the Communist Party in the early 1970s, 

              when even members of the extreme left had rejected Moscow-style 

              leadership. He toured the Soviet Union and became an agitator on 

              the University of Michigan campus, until a second, equally dramatic 

              transformation occurred, shortly after he married his second wife, 

              Susan Northway.</P>

            <P>&#34;We asked ourselves which denomination represented the extreme 

              opposite of the hard-left,&#34; Ms. Northway said in a 1999 interview. 

              &#34;Then we looked in the phone book and found the Conservative 

              Baptist Church. By the end of that summer of '76, we had come to 

              Christ.&#34;</P>

            <P>In 1985, Mr. Olasky founded a weekly newsmagazine, World, which 

              reviews events from a rigidly biblical perspective (he claims it 

              is now the fourth-largest newsmagazine in the country). He created 

              a new Presbyterian church suited to his views.</P>

            <P>A decade later, his book, <I>The Tragedy of American Compassion, 

              </I>which introduced the concept of compassionate conservatism, 

              got him noticed in Washington.</P>

            <P>When Newt Gingrich led the Republican takeover of the House of 

              Representatives in 1994, he sent a copy of the book to every congressman. 

              It was eagerly read by George W. Bush, who had converted to fundamentalist 

              Christianity in the 1980s in an effort to end his drinking problems.</P>

            <P>During his tenure as Texas governor, Mr. Bush became the first 

              state leader to allow proselytizing Christian organizations to offer 

              state-funded social programs, including a ministry-run prison program.</P>

            <P>Mr. Olasky and Mr. Bush appear to have met at an opportune moment, 

              when devoutly religious citizens -- almost half of all Americans 

              believe that the Bible is literally true -- felt profoundly alienated 

              from their government.</P>

            <P>Throughout his election campaign, Mr. Bush made outspoken appeals 

              to disenfranchised Christians. His Democratic opponent, Al Gore, 

              is also a fundamentalist Christian and made equally frequent mentions 

              of God and Jesus Christ on the stump, but Mr. Bush peppered his 

              speeches with phrases, such as &#34;personal redemption,&#34; that 

              carry special meaning for the religious right.</P>

            <P>A poll of 1,500 Americans conducted this week by Public Agenda, 

              a nonprofit research organization, found that 44 per cent think 

              government funding for social services offered by religious groups 

              is &#34;a good idea.&#34; About 30 per cent consider it &#34;a bad 

              idea,&#34; while 23 per cent would support it if the programs did 

              not carry religious messages.</P>

            <P>In other words, many Americans seem to agree with Mr. Olasky that 

              religious and secular groups should compete for the souls of the 

              American poor.</P>

            <P>&#34;The thing that's been debated for 2000 years is what is Caesar's 

              and what is God's,&#34; he said. &#34;You can't dissociate your 

              policymaking from religious views, but you can do what Bush does, 

              which is neither to encourage nor discourage religious groups, but 

              to judge by results.&#34;
