SAN FRANCISCO  - While the United States steps up

security at its nuclear power plants, energy experts warn the

plants' fuel dumps are far more vulnerable than reactors to

attack by anyone trying to spread radioactivity.

<p>``Spent fuel has never gotten the same attention as the

reactor ... as a result you don't have the same level of

security and safety as exists for the reactor,'' David Lochbaum,

a former nuclear plant engineer now with the <a href="http://www.ucsusa.org" target="_new">Union of Concerned

Scientists</a>, told Reuters.

<p>``Because it's a softer target and has greater consequences,

terrorists may elect to go after the spent fuel,'' he said.

<p>Security has been tightened at the 103 nuclear power plants

in the United States, the source of 20 percent of the country's

electricity, since the Sept. 11 hijacked plane attacks that

killed about 4,800 people in New York and the Pentagon.

<p>Amid U.S. calls for increased vigilance at strategic sites

worldwide, the head of the Vienna-based International Atomic

Energy Agency warned on Thursday that an act of nuclear

terrorism was ``far more likely'' than previously thought.

<p>Since Sept. 11, much of discussion in the nuclear industry

has focused on whether an aircraft could penetrate the steel

and concrete containment building surrounding a plant's

reactor.

<p>But nuclear experts are warning that guarding on-site

storage facilities for these same reactors' highly radioactive

spent fuel is also a critical issue that must be addressed.

<p>The Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which oversees the U.S.

nuclear industry, needs to devote more attention to this issue,

agency spokesman Victor Dricks said.

<p>DE FACTO WASTE DUMPS

<p>When most of the energy is wrung from the radioactive

pellets used to run the power plants, the spent fuel is tightly

sealed in water-filled, on-site pools. Water is needed to cool

the fuel, which gives off heat and radiation for many years

after it is removed from the reactor.

<p>Over the years, the pile of spent fuel from U.S. reactors

has grown to more than 40,000 metric tons, enough to bury a

football field under 15 feet of waste material, the

Washington-based industry group Nuclear Energy Institute said.

<p>About two-thirds of this fuel is kept in underground pools,

which provide far better containment than for the third stored

in above-ground buildings.

<p>But most of these pools are housed in far less robust

structures than the reactor containment vessels, which are

designed to contain the equivalent of a small nuclear explosion

should things go badly wrong in the reactor core.

<p>Though the walls of waste storage pools are thick,

reinforced concrete lined with steel, the roofs are made of

''pretty insubstantial material'' like sheet metal, Lynnette

Hendricks, director of licensing at Nuclear Energy Institute,

told Reuters.

<p>And while the pools lie within high security areas, there

are fewer locked doors and safety barriers between spent fuel

and the atmosphere than surrounds the fuel in the reactor.

<p>Another concern is the vulnerability of the pools' cooling

systems. ``If you knock out that system, there are no automatic

back-up systems,'' Lochbaum said.

<p>If the water boils or drains away, the discarded fuel would

overheat, either melting or catching fire, threatening to

release a radioactive cloud.

<p>POTENTIAL CONCERNS

<p>The pools, initially designed as temporary containers, can

withstand earthquakes, tornadoes and other natural calamities,

but were not built to withstand acts of sabotage.

<p>``The pools are not designed to withstand the impact of a

jetliner, but they are relatively small ... it would be

extremely difficult for an aircraft, even if deliberately

targeting one, to hit one,'' said Dricks of the Nuclear

Regulatory Commission.

<p>When most of the country's nuclear reactors were designed

in the 1960s and 1970s, it was assumed their radioactive waste

would be shipped off to a central repository or reprocessing

facility.

<p>But commercial reprocessing was never successfully

developed in the United States, and plans to open a permanent

disposal site in Nevada have already been delayed 12 years

until around 2010 -- if it opens at all.

<p>While legislators, power companies and environmentalists

squabble over what to do with the spent fuel, storage space in

the temporary facilities gets ever more crowded.

<p>``Now (pools) hold considerably more (spent fuel) than in a

reactor,'' said Gordon Thompson, a nuclear scientist and

executive director of the Institute for Resource and Security

Studies, an independent think tank based in Cambridge,

Massachusetts.

<p>It only takes about five to six years of operation for a

power plant to produce more nuclear waste than it holds in its

reactor, and the biggest of these pools now holds seven to

eight times as much fuel as in a reactor, said Lochbaum of the

Union of Concerned Scientists.</p>
