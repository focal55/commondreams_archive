LONDON  - A group of 100 protesters on Tuesday

invaded a British defense site which could play a key role in the

United States ``Son of Star Wars'' missile defense system.

<p>British, Danish and American protesters were among a group of

activists occupying three areas in the Menwith Hill base in

northern England, campaign group Greenpeace said.

</font>President Bush's proposed shield system is intended to

protect the United States and its allies from long range missile

attack.

<p>British Prime Minister Tony Blair  has said he has taken no

decision on whether to back the project but his spokesman has

signaled broad support.

<p>Many Europeans are skeptical about the proposed missile

shield's capability after some test failures. They are also

concerned that the United States should not tear up key arms

control treaties with Russia that limit such defenses.

<p>Greenpeace said 50 activists, some carrying flags with the

message ``Star Wars Starts Wars'' and others dressed as missiles,

had gone in through the base's front gate. Others had scaled the

razor wire perimeter fence.

<p>Greenpeace member Helen Wallace said: ``I am chained to a

water tower inside the site.

<p>``A number of people have been arrested. We are going to stay

here to make our point that Menwith Hill is part of Bush's

dangerous Star Wars plan and we want Tony Blair to stop that,''

she told BBC radio.

<p>A Ministry of Defense spokeswoman said protesters were on a

water tower and on the roof of the control room after a group of

100 had rushed the main gate and scaled the fence.

<p>``There have been a number of arrests,'' she added.

<p>Greenpeace said that if Britain gives the go-ahead, Menwith

Hill will be used as a ground relay station to transmit

information on missile location and trajectory back to the U.S.

to help with targeting for interceptor missiles.
