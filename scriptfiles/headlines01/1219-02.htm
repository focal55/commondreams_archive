SACRAMENTO -- When Sacramento Bee publisher and president Janis Besler Heaphy walked 

away from the podium at Arco Arena recently, drowned by boos and foot stomping,

<P>she showed that a country built on free speech and dissent continues to 

struggle with how to behave in wartime.

<P>Heaphy's winter 2001 commencement address for California State University 

at Sacramento questioned whether the government's response to Sept. 11 would 

erode civil liberties. But the crowd didn't want to hear it -- and their jeers 

silenced her.

</table>Some students and parents said Heaphy simply politicized their "special day,

" but fallout from the speech also is continued evidence of how dramatically 

public discourse has changed since Sept. 11. Attorney General John Ashcroft 

made the starkest comments to date when he warned that people raising the 

"phantoms of lost liberties" were aiding terrorists.

<P>"I would think that three months after Sept. 11 we would be getting to the 

point where we could be circumspect about the new reality," said Nancy Snow, a 

government propaganda expert and lecturer at the Annenberg School for 

Communication at the University of Southern California. "But there is a lot of 

fear that you will not been seen as a patriot. I would hope that this would 

not have a chilling effect."

<P>Radio talk show host Rush Limbaugh, who calls Sacramento his adoptive 

hometown, branded Heaphy arrogant for her "mean-spirited diatribe against the 

Bush administration." The Drudge Report  featured three 

posts about the controversy. Local talk radio hosts and callers hammered the 

subject yesterday, and the Bee printed 11 of several dozen letters and e-mails 

it received.

<P>"Heaphy had an inappropriate political agenda," wrote reader Kelly Heikila 

of Colfax. "She took it upon herself to push her opinions and viewpoints on a 

large, captive audience."

<P>An unusually large crowd of 17,000 people listened to about eight minutes 

of Heaphy's speech at Arco Arena on Saturday. But many of them started booing 

and stamping their feet when she raised questions about the federal detention 

of more than 1,000 people since Sept. 11, racial profiling of Middle Eastern 

men and secret military tribunals.

<P>"No one argues the validity and need for both retaliation and security," 

Heaphy said, according to a copy of the speech. "But to what lengths are we 

willing to go to achieve them? Specifically, to what degree are we willing to 

compromise our civil liberties in the name of security?"

<P>Heaphy declined to comment other than to issue a one-paragraph statement 

saying she stands by her speech.

<P>University President Donald Gerth said that a small group of people in the 

balcony had created the initial commotion but that others apologized to Heaphy.

<P>Gerth called the hecklers rude and said Heaphy's speech was "not only 

thoughtful but exceedingly responsible in today's world."

<P>But unlike Gerth, who says he likes substance in commencement speeches, 

many students questioned why she would criticize the government at a ceremony 

usually devoted to a speech with the theme, "The world is your oyster."

<P>"As for the speech itself, I think the ideas expressed were totally right 

on," said Eric Guerra, 23, an engineering student and executive vice president 

of the Associated Students. "As far as the appropriateness at a graduation 

ceremony, it's a little iffy."

<P>Bee political columnist Daniel Weintraub said he had received dozens of e-

mails from people who attended the speech, and many of them complained about 

the appropriateness of the subject at a graduation. But he disagreed.

<P>"It wasn't political. It wasn't partisan. She's not running for office or 

promoting herself," Weintraub said. "She was talking about an issue that, 

other than the war itself, is the most important issue in the country today. 

What better topic to discuss at a graduation ceremony?"
