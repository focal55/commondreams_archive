Relations between the world's two nuclear superpowers were plummeting to new depths yesterday as Moscow attacked the United States as an &#34;immoral&#34; supporter of terrorism.

<P>The Kremlin was infuriated by Washington's decision to dispatch a high-ranking official to meet a senior Chechen rebel envoy just two days after a wave of deadly car bombings for which Russia has blamed the guerrillas.</P>

<P>The co-ordinated bombings killed 23 people and wounded more than 130 in southern Russia near the boundary with the renegade province.</P>

<P>By meeting with the Chechens, President George W. Bush's new administration has shown &#34;on what side it stands in the international struggle against terrorism,&#34; the Russian Foreign Ministry snapped yesterday.</P>

<P>&#34;Such a step by a great civilized power would have looked unnatural in the past,&#34; it said. &#34;After the latest bloody crimes of the Chechen terrorists, Washington's action seems simply immoral.&#34;</P>

<P>Russia had warned of retaliation against Washington if the meeting went ahead, but was ignored.</P>

<P>Analysts say the relationship between Moscow and Washington has tumbled to its worst level since the Cold War, with increasingly bellicose rhetoric on both sides.</P>

<P>

    Relations, already tense over U.S. plans to build a national missile-defence system, have deteriorated further during the fallout over a scandal involving Federal Bureau of Investigation agent Robert Hanssen, accused of spying for Moscow over a 15-year period.</P>

<P>In such an atmosphere, the symbolism of Monday's meeting between John Beyrle, U.S. assistant secretary of state for newly independent nations, and rebel foreign minister Ilyas Akhmadov was unmistakable.</P>

<P>Under former president Bill Clinton's administration, a lower-ranking desk officer met with Mr. Akhmadov. But by allowing a senior diplomat to meet the Chechen envoy, the new government sent a clear signal of its willingness to defy Russian warnings -- even when it knows it will provoke Moscow.</P>

<P>The meeting was also a sign of the mounting U.S. pressure on Russia to begin negotiating a political solution to the war in Chechnya.</P>

<P>The battle erupted within hours of Monday's meeting. A Kremlin spokesman, Sergei Yastrzhembsky, accused Washington of &#34;double standards.&#34; The chairman of a parliamentary foreign-affairs committee, Dmitry Rogozin, said the United States can now be considered an official supporter of terrorism.</P>

<P>Meanwhile, Russia escalated the feud over the espionage scandal last night. State television played secret surveillance footage of three U.S. diplomats, accusing them of spying on Russia.</P>

<P>The grainy black-and-white videotape, released by secret police, showed two of the diplomats meeting a Russian man at a restaurant near Moscow's zoo. The diplomats offered money to the man in exchange for maps of secret minefields in a Siberian river near strategic Russian sites, the television channel alleged.</P>

<P>The third diplomat, U.S. naval attach&#233; Robert Brannon, was shown in other surveillance tapes and was accused of gathering secret information on a Russian reconnaissance vessel in the Mediterranean.</P>

<P>The television channel said police released the videotapes in retaliation for the Bush administration's &#34;unfriendly actions&#34; in sending home or expelling 50 Russian diplomats from Washington last week in the aftermath of the Hanssen affair.</P>

<P>In a tit-for-tat response, Russia vowed to expel the same number of U.S. diplomats. The Kremlin confirmed yesterday that it has given the United States a list of four diplomats to be expelled within 10 days. It also handed over a second list of 46 diplomats to be expelled.</P>

<P>Washington's new tough line against Moscow has included a refusal to hold an early summit meeting with President Vladimir Putin, criticism of Russian arms deals with Iran and condemnation of the Kremlin's espionage activities.</P>
