WASHINGTON - A $33.5 billion energy bill in the Republican-controlled House advertises the $3.3 billion in tax credits it includes for "clean-coal" technology as a means to promote conservation.

<P> But critics say that is one way sponsors are misrepresenting their efforts to pass billions of dollars more in tax breaks and rule changes for energy producers than the White House has proposed. The clean-coal credits would not encourage consumers to use less electricity, and, they say, the proposed aid for producers in Republican energy bills would outstrip incentives for conservation.</P>

<P> Republican sponsors, led by Representative Bill Thomas, the California chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, describe the measure as "a balanced package of tax measures that address energy conservation, energy production and energy reliability."</P>

<P> The coal and electric utility industries say emerging clean-coal technologies could allow coal to be burned more efficiently and cleanly, with less polluting emissions. "If we can squeeze more electricity out of a single lump of coal, I call that conservation," said Ronald Clements of the Edison Electric Institute.</P>

<P> The energy bill, approved last week by the House Ways and Means Committee, is one of several the full House will take up soon, either individually or in one package. In jockeying over the package, environmental groups have singled out the Republican claims about the clean coal as evidence of misrepresentation.</P>

<P> "Coal is the dirtiest fossil fuel, and even the cleanest coal produces large amounts of pollution," a coalition of 13 environmental groups, including Friends of the Earth and the U.S. Public Interest Research Group, said in a letter released today. It urges members of Congress to reject what it calls "a slew of new and expanded incentives for polluting sources of energy." </P>

<P> Clean-coal advocates, including John Grasser of the National Mining Association and Mr. Clements, say developing technology could improve efficiencies at coal-burning power plants, so less coal would be burned.</P>

<P> The question of how much any energy plan should encourage conservation has already proved of political importance. Polls show a weakening of public support for President Bush as a result of a perception that his administration was giving short shrift to conservation.</P>

<P> Before releasing its own energy plan in May, the administration scrambled to give increased prominence to conservation. House Republicans have followed suit in preparing the Ways and Means measure and other energy bills.</P>

<P> But the tax breaks and rule changes in the bills that favor the oil, coal, gas and electric industries far outstrip the incentives for conservation, government watchdog groups say. The Joint Committee on Taxation estimated that $12.5 billion would go to conservation efforts, but environmental groups are disputing that figure, noting that it includes the clean-coal tax credits and measures that would repeal certain excise taxes on diesel fuel. The environmentalists argue that the true conservation figure is closer to $5.9 billion.</P>

<P> Under the Ways and Means bill, the proposed benefits for clean-coal technology would include a 10 percent investment tax credit for utilities that built new power plants using the new technologies. It would also provide tax credits meant to encourage the efficient operations of the plants and to help protect against the risks of early operating losses.</P>

<P> Those benefits for clean coal would account for nearly 10 percent of the bill's $33.5 billion price tag, and nearly 25 percent of the $12.5 billion being claimed for conservation.</P>

<P> Even Mr. Grasser, the chief spokesman for the mining association, conceded today that listing them under the conservation heading "might be a little bit of a misnomer." </P>

<P> And a Ways and Means spokesman, Mark Gundersen, said the listing of the tax credit as a conservation tool has been done partly because it seemed to fit neither of the other two categories, the $12.97 billion set aside for energy reliability and $7.98 billion for production.</P>

<P> "Clean-coal technology will not result in more energy, nor does it maintain a steady supply," he said. "But, it does ensure our consumption of energy in cleaner, which is the focus of the conservation section."</P>

<P> But the environmentalists, in their letter, said Congress should direct resources to technologies "that hold the promise of greater energy independence and a cleaner environment." In the Ways and Means bill, the oil industry would benefit from several provisions, including one that would shorten depreciation for refinery assets from to 7 years from 10, at $1.3 billion over 10 years.</P>

<P> Another benefit that the oil industry considered especially important would delay rental payments associated with inventory and property held for resale, said an official for the American Petroleum Institute. That measure would cost $1.16 billion.</P>

<P> A bill approved by the House Resources Committee would open a swath of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska to oil drilling and would extend an expiring measure to encourage deep-water drilling by offering some relief from royalties.</P>

<P> Under the Ways and Means bill, several electric companies could avoid an estimated $2 billion in taxes by allowing utilities to transfer control of their power lines to independents tax-free, if they are required to do so by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.</P>

<P> As for conservation provisions, a number would benefit the automobile industry and manufacturers, with consumers. "We did exceptionally well in Ways and Means," said David Nemtzow, president of the nonprofit Alliance to Save Energy, which promotes conservation.</P>

<P> The bill would create a tax credit for buying cars that are powered by electricity, fuel cells or a combination of alternative sources and gas. Home builders would get a $2,000 tax credit for building highly energy-efficient new homes. And appliance manufacturers, would receive a break for producing energy-saving refrigerators and washing machines. Consumers would get tax credits for making upgrades to their homes that make them more efficient, like installing insulation and new windows.</P>

<P> "Right now these technologies are for the Radio Shack crowd," Mr. Nemtzow said. "The reason you have any tax credits is to have them broadly disseminated. It's good policy. That's the substantive reason. Politically, it's quite clear that the House Republican leadership wants to demonstrate they don't have antipathy to energy efficiency."</P>

<P> Democrats on the Ways and Means Committee opposed the tax package, arguing that there was not enough money to pay for them.</P>
