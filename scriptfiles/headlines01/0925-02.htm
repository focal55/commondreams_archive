LONDON  - Britain's peace campaigners are struggling to make their voices heard above the din of demands for military reprisals against alleged terrorist mastermind Osama bin Laden.

</font>The horror evoked when hijackers crashed airliners into New York's World Trade Center, killing thousands, provoked a huge public appetite for retaliation against the Taliban regime in Afghanistan which has been harboring bin Laden.

<p>A poll for The Observer showed that three-quarters of British men back "surgical" air strikes against countries knowingly harboring terrorist organizations, although the figure fell to 55 percent among women.</p>

<p>An ICM poll for the Guardian newspaper last week found 66 percent wanted military action, with just 14 percent opposed to strikes.</p>

<p>Faced with such results, peace groups are working hard to organize rallies and vigils to get their message across.</p>

<p>"It's been difficult having our voice heard," admits Nigel Chamberlain, a spokesman for veteran British peace campaigners CND (the <a href="http://www.cnduk.org/" target="_new">Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament</a>).</p>

<p>"It may be still a minority in terms of the public as a whole (who are opposed to western military strikes), but out there there's a general disquiet about retaliation and its implications that's set to grow."</p>

<p>On Saturday, up to 5,000 people held a peace vigil at government offices at Whitehall in central London, according to Chamberlain.</p>

<p>CND distributed 1,000 cards carrying the words "Stand shoulder to shoulder for peace and justice."</p>

<p>The message echoed Prime Minister Tony Blair's promise that Britain, the closest European ally of the United States, would stand shoulder to shoulder with it in its war against terrorism.</p>

<p>The high attendance at the rally reflected a "massive increase in feelings of fear and trepidation about western retaliation," according to Chris Nineham of Globalize Resistance, an umbrella group which includes anarchists, trade unionists, anti-globalization protesters and Greens.</p>

<p>Asked about polls showing that most Britons favor retaliation, Nineham said: "When you start asking about blanket bombing and British troops on the ground, you get a majority of people against it.</p>

<p>"Those polls are not a mandate for all-out war, which is what the western powers are talking about."</p>

<p>And he insisted: "We are beginning to get our message across. There's already a deep unease about what the results of a mass onslaught will be. </p>

<p>"Most people recognize that innocent people in Afghanistan will die, leading to increased bitterness against the West."</p>

<p>Michael Foot, former leader of Britain's Labour Party, is to speak at a meeting titled "US Crisis -- Peace Not War!" in north London on October 4.</p>

<p>He will address members of the Labour Party, CND, the Green Party and the Socialist Alliance about predicted US retaliatory strikes, which are thought likely to involve British forces.</p>

<p>Maddy Cooper, of the Socialist Alliance, who will chair the meeting, said: "We urgently need to make it clear to the Blair government that we want justice, not revenge.</p>

<p>"The meeting will give us an opportunity to start to organize locally against the drift to war."</p>
