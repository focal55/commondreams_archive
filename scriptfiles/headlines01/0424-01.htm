PARIS  - Aid figures released by a grouping of rich

nations

Monday

have belied the widespread view that world's poorer nations will

profit from

economic growth in the industrialised countries. 

<P>

The countries of Africa, Asia, the Caribbean and Latin America got

53.1

billion

dollars last year in official development assistance (ODA), down

from 56.4

billion dollars they received in 1999 . <P>

A special committee of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation

and

Development (OECD) said, despite a strong overall growth last

year, aid as a

proportion of the 23-member DAC's combined GNP had declined from

0.24 percent

in 1999 to 0.22 percent, thus returning to the 1997 level. <P>

The members of the Development Assistance Committee are:

Australia, Austria,

Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece,

Ireland, Italy,

Japan, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal,

Spain,

Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, the United States and the

European

Commission. <P>

The ODA/GNP ratio last year was in stark contrast to the United

Nations target

of 0.7 percent adopted by the world body's General Assembly in

1970. Since

then, only a handful of countries have achieved the goal. These,

the OECD said

in a news release were: Denmark (1.06 percent), Netherlands ((0.82

percent),

Sweden (0.81 percent), Norway (0.80 percent) and Luxembourg (0.7

percent). <P>

Also known as the rich nations' club, the OECD said that ODA by

the countries

of the Development Assistance Committee in real terms had fallen

''slightly in

2000 - by 1.6 percent''. In current prices and exchange rates, the

total net

ODA flows registered a fall of 6.0 percent. <P>

''But most of this drop was due to lower exchange rates for most

currencies

against the United States dollar,'' the OECD said. <P>

Explaining the decline in ODA, the OECD said, two special factors

were

responsible. One of these was a change in the list of countries

eligible to

receive ODA. Adjusting for these changes, total ODA fell by just

0.2

percent at

constant prices and exchange rates. <P>

Another highlight of 2000: Japan's aid was 2.3 billion dollars

lower than in

1999, when it included exceptional contributions to the Asian

Development Bank

in the wake of the Asian financial crisis. <P>

The OECD pointed out that 15 of the DAC member countries reported

a rise in

ODA

in real terms in 2000. For 12 of these, the increase in ODA

equalled or

outpaced their economic growth. <P>

Luxembourg reached for the first time, the United Nations' 0.7

percent target

for ODA as a proportion of GNP, joining Denmark, which reached its

highest

ODA/GNP ratio ever recorded, the Netherlands, Norway and Sweden

who

continue to

surpass this target. <P>

No other countries exceeded the average country effort of 0.39

percent of GNP. <P>

Aid from the United Kingdom rose by 35.6 percent in real terms,

more than

compensating for the 10.6 percent fall last year, with the rebound

due to the

timing of its multilateral contributions and its commitment to an

increased

budget for aid. Belgium (21.7 percent), Greece (28.7 percent), the

Netherlands

(10.0 percent) and Sweden (22.3 percent) also increased their aid

substantially. <P>

Aid disbursements by the European Commission rose in real terms by

12.6

percent. <P>

Total aid from the non-G7 DAC countries increased by 8.3 percent

in real terms

and accounted for 26 percent of DAC members' ODA, compared with

their 12

percent share of DAC GNP. <P>

Total aid from G7 countries - Britain, France, Germany, Italy,

Japan, the

United States and Canada - fell by 4.8 percent in real terms,

because of the

exceptional fall in Japan's aid, combined with a fall in aid from

France. <P>

According to the OECD, the decline in French aid was due mainly to

the fact

that aid to French Polynesia and New Caledonia is no longer

counted as ODA,

and

a fall in aid from Italy, due to the timing of its payments to

multilateral

agencies. <P>

Among the other G7 countries, Germany's ODA was up from 0.26

percent to 0.27

percent, Canada's fell slightly. <P>

OECD published the aid figures two days ahead of a meeting of the

DAC Apr.

25-26 in Paris. <P>

Last Friday, the OECD pointed out that one person in five across

the globe

still lives on less than one dollar a day despite the economic

boom or rapid

growth in many parts of the world. <P>

Poverty reduction will, therefore, top the agenda, according to

OECD officials

in Paris and the German Ministry of Economic Co-operation and

Development in

Bonn. Known as a High Level Meeting of the DAC, it will also

discuss the

coherence of their policies impacting on developing countries. <P>

Another important issue on which the DAC members have until now

failed to

reach

a consensus is untying aid to the developing nations in order to

enable

them to

buy machinery and equipment in a country other than the one

providing the

funds.
