LOS ANGELES  - Four activist groups sued the city

of Los Angeles and its police department in federal court on

Thursday claiming that officers who clubbed and shot protesters

with pepper spray and rubber bullets at the Democratic National

Convention last year, violated their U.S. constitutional

rights.

<p>``LAPD's unconstitutional use of force targets everyone and

anyone who dares to speak out about the injustices of our

society,'' James Lafferty, executive director of the Los Angeles

chapter of the National Lawyers Guild, said at a press

conference outside police headquarters Thursday.

<p>``Its target is the right to dissent. Its target is

constitutional government as we know it.''

<p>Los Angeles Police Department spokesman Sgt. John

Pasquariello, who attended the press conference as an observer,

told Reuters: ``We're against police brutality too.'' He refused

to comment further.

<p>The suit, filed in federal district court by the Lawyers

Guild, the American Civil Liberties Union and two coalitions

against police brutality, seeks unspecified punitive and

compensatory damages as well as an end to alleged police

tactics it claims violated protesters' rights under the First,

Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution.

<p>Among its claims the suit details a variety of measures --

some of them violent -- that officers allegedly used to

deliberately suppress free speech, and block protesters' rights

to peacefully assemble and petition the government at the DNC

last August and at a protest outside LAPD headquarters last

October.

<p>LAWYER SHOT BETWEEN EYES WITH BEAN BAG

<p>``The central question that is raised by this lawsuit is

really very simple and straightforward,'' Lafferty said. ``Can we

as a people still peacefully, without fear of police violence,

assemble in the streets of Los Angeles and freely criticize our

government, or can't we?''

<p>The suit states that people were prevented from freely

entering and exiting organized protests and were unlawfully

detained. Several were injured in a series of clubbings and

shootings by police officers who fired beanbags and rubber

bullets directly into nonviolent crowds.

<p>One woman, an ACLU attorney who said she was peacefully

observing the DNC protests from a sidewalk, was shot between

the eyes with a beanbag by a police officer standing about 80

feet away.

<p>``The only way I could have been shot between the eyes is if

the officer aimed for my head,'' attorney Carol Sobel said.

Officers are supposed to aim for the ground when employing

''nonlethal'' methods of crowd control, she added.

<p>The suit alleges that such supposedly ``nonlethal'' tactics

have ``a chilling effect'' on ``countless people who would

otherwise exercise their constitutional right to free speech in

public places within the city, were it not for fear of ... the

LAPD.''

<p>The suit seeks injunctions against four specific policies

it claims the LAPD routinely practices to suppress lawful

protest.

<p>Those include ``improperly terminating'' legally permitted

political demonstrations without good reason; using ``excessive

force'' in a ``lethal manner'' against peaceful protesters;

preventing people from entering and exiting permitted marches

and rallies while they are in progress and detaining them after

those events have concluded; and flying police helicopters so

low to demonstrations that they drown out protesters' voices.
