WASHINGTON/NEW YORK  - President Bush  on Saturday

vowed a ``sweeping, sustained and effective'' campaign against those

behind this week's terror attack on the United States, as rescue

workers sifted wreckage and lifted body parts from New York's World

Trade Center, where thousands remain entombed.

<p>As winds of war strengthened, Bush for the first time singled

out Saudi-born militant Osama bin Laden, holed up in Afghanistan 

under the protection of its radical Islamic government, as a prime

suspect behind the attacks. Bush warned bin Laden he would not be

able to hide from America's wrath.

<p>Fearful Afghans began fleeing the country. Their hardline

Taliban rulers threatened to wage a holy war against anyone helping

Washington launch attacks on their country.

<p>In his weekly radio address and in comments to reporters, Bush

stepped up his rhetoric to its highest pitch since Tuesday's

attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, which have

left hundreds confirmed dead and almost 5,000 people still

unaccounted for.

<p>``Those who make war against the United States have chosen their

own destruction,'' Bush declared.

<p>``We are planning a broad and sustained campaign to secure our

country and eradicate the evil of terrorism, and we are determined

to see this conflict through.

<p>``I will not settle for a token act. Our response must be

sweeping, sustained and effective. ... You will be asked for your

patience, for the conflict will not be short. You will be asked for

resolve, for the conflict will not be easy. You will be asked for

your strength because the course to victory may be long,'' the

president said.

<p>In brief additional remarks to reporters, Bush spoke for the

first time about bin Laden, the multi-millionaire who has devoted

his fortune to attacking U.S. targets in the name of a radical

anti-western, fundamentalist ideology.

<p>Bush said: ``He is what we would call a prime suspect. If he

thinks he can hide from the United States, and our allies, he will

be sorely mistaken.

<p>In New York, meanwhile, where the heart-breaking work of

excavating the wreckage continued, family members of those missing

were asked to bring in hairbrushes, toothbrushes or clothing of

their loved ones to help in DNA identification of body parts.

<p>PAKISTAN ON BOARD

<p>Stepping up diplomatic efforts to build an international

coalition for the forthcoming military onslaught, the United States

secured the crucial agreement of Pakistan, which borders

Afghanistan, to back its efforts.

<p>The United States has sought from Pakistan permission for

military overflights and a closing of its border with Afghanistan,

among other items.

<p>``We put before the Pakistan government a specific list of

things we would like cooperation on and they have agreed to all

those items. The Pakistan government was very forthcoming and we're

appreciative,'' said Secretary of State Colin Powell.

<p>For its part, Pakistan said it would comply with United

Nations  Security Council resolutions on the terror attacks. ``The

government will discharge its responsibilities under international

law,'' Foreign Minister Abdul Sattar said, adding that he did not

expect Pakistan to take part in military operations outside its

borders.

<p>At ground zero in Manhattan, gray and brown clouds of smoke and

dust continued to billow from the rubble of what were once New

York's tallest buildings, and a stench rose from the site. The dust

from mountains of ash continued to drift up and down the island,

raising fears about air quality.

<p>Almost four days after hijacked planes brought the massive

110-story skyscrapers crashing to the ground, the rescuers had made

only a small dent in their task of clearing the wreckage.

<p>Bush's visit to the site Friday lifted morale among rescue

workers who greeted his speech with chants of ``USA! USA!''

<p>



Police Commissioner Bernard Kerik said the number of missing

had fallen to 4,717. He said 124 people were confirmed dead, 59 of

them identified, but did not explain why the figure was lower than

the 184 bodies reported on Thursday. No survivors have been found

since Wednesday.

<p>At least 190 people are believed to have died when hijackers

crashed a third plane into the Pentagon near Washington. Forty five

more died in a fourth plane that crashed in Pennsylvania after

passengers fought with hijackers and foiled their plan to crash

into another landmark building.

<p>India has also signaled it is ready to let the United States

use its military bases. India could provide a large base for any

military strike at Afghanistan, but U.S. jets would still have to

cross Pakistani airspace to reach Afghanistan.

<p>Aides to bin Laden, accused of engineering attacks on U.S.

embassies in Africa in 1998 from his Afghanistan headquarters, this

week denied involvement in the carnage, which bin Laden described

as ``punishment from almighty Allah.''

<p>U.S. TELLS OTHER NATIONS TO CHOOSE SIDES

<p>Washington's message to other nations, including Arab and

Islamic states, is that they must choose sides. In the coming

storm, they are being told they must either back the United States

or risk diplomatic and economic isolation.

<p>Congress late on Friday authorized Bush to use ``all necessary

and appropriate force'' against those responsible for Tuesday's

attacks. Bush, leading a national day of prayer and remembrance,

vowed ``to rid the world of evil.''

<p>Meanwhile, the nation remained wrapped in mourning. Most

weekend sporting events were canceled, including Major League

baseball and National Football League play -- which never happened

throughout World War II or in response to the 1963 assassination of

President John F. Kennedy.

<p>Commercial flights resumed, but at less than half their former

capacity.

<p>In New York, technicians planned to test trading and computer

systems in readiness for the planned reopening of the stock

exchange and financial markets on Monday. Analysts predicted great

volatility and said it was not certain the systems would hold up

under the pressure.

<p>The FBI on Friday named 19 hijackers, including seven pilots,

who commandeered the four airliners used in Tuesday's terror

attacks, sought to question more than 100 people and made the first

arrest in the investigation, a witness said to have ``material''

information on the suicide attacks.

<p>Search crews on Friday found the cockpit voice recorder of

United Airlines Flight 93 at the Pennsylvania crash site, an FBI

spokeswoman said. Officials had earlier found the flight data

recorder from the aircraft.

<p>GREEN LIGHT FROM OUTRAGED CONGRESS

<p>With one dissenting voice, an outraged U.S. House of

Representatives gave final congressional approval to a use-of-force

resolution that won unanimous Senate backing earlier in the day.

<p>Short of a formal declaration of war, the measure gave Bush the

green light to strike both individuals and nations he determines

''planned, authorized, committed or aided the terrorist attacks.''

<p>Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld activated 35,000 reservists

out of 50,000 authorized by Bush to provide ``strike-alert'' jet

fighter protection and perform other duties at domestic military

bases.

<p>An FBI spokeswoman said the discovery by search crews of the

cockpit voice recorder in Pennsylvania raised the possibility

further details would be learned of the drama on board. She said

the device was located 25 feet (8 meters) below ground and had been

sent to Washington for review.

<p>Pennsylvania's two U.S. senators said the doomed passengers of

the hijacked airliner that crashed near Pittsburgh could be awarded

America's highest civilian honors after apparently thwarting an

attack on a U.S. landmark.
