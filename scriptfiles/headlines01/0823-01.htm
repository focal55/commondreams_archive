UNITED NATIONS - More than 200 activists, civil

rights leaders and celebrities urged the United Nations on

Wednesday to challenge America&#39;s drug laws in an upcoming

UN conference on racism, saying they discriminated against

African-Americans and Hispanics.  

<p>

In <a href="http://www.drugpolicy.org/lindesmith/news/race_conf_letter2.html" target="_new">a petition</a> to UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan, the

signatories said the US war on drugs was &quot;not a war on

plants and chemicals, but on citizens and other human beings

who all too often are members of racial and ethnic minorities.&quot;  

<p>

The <a href="http://www.drugpolicy.org/lindesmith/news/race_conf_letter2.html" target="_new">petitioners</a> included actor Danny Glover; singer Harry

Belafonte; New Mexico Governor Gary Johnson; Julian Bond,

chairman of the National Association for the Advancement of

Colored People; former New York City mayor David Dinkins and

dozens of legislators, church leaders, scholars and scientists.  

<p>

UN spokesman Fred Eckhard said Annan had not yet seen

the the petition, but he noted that UN member states were

writing the conference document, not the secretary-general.  

<p>

Whites use as many drugs as Latinos and African

Americans. 

<p>

But among those incarcerated for drug offences in

the United States, 57 percent are black and 22 percent are

Hispanic -- partly because the drugs they use, such as &quot;crack&quot;

cocaine carry tougher sentences, the letter said.  

<p>

&quot;The war on drugs is rooted in racial bias,&quot; it charged.  

<p>

The UN conference against racism is due to be held in

Durban, beginning on August 31, but negotiations

over the meeting are deadlocked over demands by Arab

nations that the conference texts link Zionism with racism. 

<p>

This

has prompted the United States to threaten to boycott the

meeting.
