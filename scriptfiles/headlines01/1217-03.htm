A 30-year-old legacy from the Cold War has surfaced on a remote 

Alaskan island, where scientists and Aleutian natives are concerned that 

radiation from the largest nuclear weapons blast ever conducted in America 

could now be leaking into the marine environment.

<P>At precisely 11 a.m. on Nov. 6, 1971, weapons specialists from the Atomic 

Energy Commission exploded a 5-megaton bomb -- a prototype for a ballistic 

missile warhead -- inside a mile-deep shaft drilled beneath Amchitka Island 

only 87 miles from Petropavlovsk, Russia's Siberian naval base.

<P>The thermonuclear blast was almost 400 times more powerful than the weapon 

that destroyed Hiroshima. Code-named Cannikin, the weapon shattered the 

shaft's walls and blasted a huge cavern lined with glasslike molten rock. It 

triggered a rockfall of jagged boulders from a nearby cliff, created a mile-

wide crater atop ground zero that filled with water now known as Cannikin Lake,

<P>uplifted a mile of the nearby ground by 20 feet, and vented groundwater 

through cracks and old seismic faults throughout the site.

<P>The blast was felt throughout Alaska, and it registered as a magnitude-7 

earthquake recorded by seismographs around the world.

<P>At the American Geophysical Union meeting in San Francisco last week, John 

C. Eichelberger of the University of Alaska Geophysical Institute and his 

colleagues reported evidence that tectonic forces moving deep beneath the 

seabed have been splitting Amchitka apart and creating fresh underground 

fissures in the island's rocky coast.

<P>They voiced their growing concern that for 22 years neither the Energy 

Department nor any other government agency has monitored Amchitka's foggy 

rockbound coast or its nearby waters to learn whether radioactive elements 

might be leaking from the island into the marine environment.

<P>Thirty years ago, the phenomenon known as plate tectonics was virtually 

unknown, so scientists did not realize that a vast slab of the Earth's crust 

called the Pacific plate has been diving ponderously down beneath North 

America's continental plate for millions upon millions of years, Eichelberger 

said.

</p>

<b>DOWNWARD TO WESTWARD</b>

<P>Recent geophysical evidence shows that along the Aleutian island chain 

where Amchitka lies, the downward motion -- called subduction -- has shifted 

more into a westward-sliding motion of the Pacific Plate that has been tearing 

the chain apart at a rate of about 2 centimeters -- more than three-quarters 

of an inch -- a year.

<P>As a result, Eichelberger said at the geophysics meeting, the Amchitka site 

"was -- unknowingly at the time -- like having a nuclear test site right next 

to the San Andreas fault."

<P>Because the island itself may be splitting in the inexorable grip of the 

tectonic forces, it is quite possible that new seismic faults and new fissures 

in Amchitka's rocks have opened up around the Cannikin blast site, allowing 

hazardous radioactive elements to escape into the sea around the island, 

Eichelberger said.

<P>Five years ago, Greenpeace, the environmental activist organization, tested 

the waters around the island and said its experts had found dangerous 

plutonium there, as well as americium, a nuclear fission byproduct.

<P>But they found no trace of tritium, the radioactive form of hydrogen, which 

is the telltale sign of a hydrogen bomb blast's residue, and Alaskan 

environmental watchdogs as well as the Department of Energy determined that 

the radioactive pollution came from fallout from Chinese nuclear weapons tests 

in the atmosphere.

<P></p>

<b>RELYING ON COMPUTER MODELS</b>

<P>Energy Department experts have created computer models of the Cannikin 

blast's aftermath and have concluded that radioactive elements from the 

explosion are effectively contained within the cavity created by the test.

<P>But the Departments of Energy and Defense have never monitored the waters 

offshore from Amchitka, nor have they tested coastal rocks, kelp beds or 

marine animals for radiation.

<P>"Some computer models suggest that the Cannikin cavity could in fact leak," 

Eichelberger said in an interview. "So the questions remain: First, is there a 

significant risk, and second, if there is, what should we do about it?"

<P>After his group's presentation of the Amchitka issue, Eichelberger held an 

informal evening meeting of experts to discuss the possibility of an 

independent investigation. The session included several specialists from the 

Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.

<P>David Smith, a Livermore nuclear chemist who has followed up on the weapons 

test effects at the Nevada test site, agreed that the best science possible is 

essential to ascertain the status of Amchitka today.

<P>"Over the best 30 years," Eichelberger said, "the world of geophysics has 

been literally turned upside down. Our knowledge of plate tectonics has become 

solid, and our measurement techniques have vastly improved. This is not a call 

to arms. It is a call to thinking."

</p>

<b>ON-SITE STUDIES DEMANDED</b>

<P>Both the state of Alaska and its native organizations remain strongly 

concerned about the Defense Department's failure to conduct an on-site 

investigation of the radiation issue in Amchitka's marine environment, 

according to Douglas H. Dasher, a specialist on radiation contaminants for the 

Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation, who attended the geophysics 

meeting.

<P>"The DOE likes to make computer models, but what's really happening out 

there inside the fissures and faults on the island no one knows," Dasher said 

in an interview.

<P>Native members of the Aleutian/Pribiloff Islands Association rely on the 

marine life of the islands for their living, and have long called for on-site 

studies of the radiation issue at Amchitka.

<P>According the Dasher, commercial fishermen -- including Americans, Japanese 

and Russians -- work the waters of the Aleutian island chain. And the native 

peoples regularly use "subsistance foods" -- the meat of stellar sea lions, 

harbor seals and ptarmigan, as well as fish -- for a diet much healthier than 

the fast-food chains that are encroaching on their traditional lifestyle.

<P>"The DOE's models and risk assessments of the effects of Cannikin and the 

other two nuclear tests of 30 years ago say there's essentially no risk of 

radiation contamination," Dasher said. "But that doesn't provide much 

confidence for the native populations up there, and like them, we say, 'How do 

you really know?' We need actual hard facts, not just smoke and mirrors."
