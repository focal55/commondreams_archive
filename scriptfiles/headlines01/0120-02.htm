WASHINGTON  - President-elect George W. Bush  starts
his first day in office on Saturday with a positive job approval
rating of 42 percent, according to a Reuters/Zogby poll released
on Inauguration Day.
<p>The poll, conducted on Wednesday among 601 people, found that
overall 20.7 percent rated his job performance as excellent since
being announced as president-elect, 21.3 percent said it was good
while 22.4 percent ranked it as fair and 14.3 percent as poor.
<p>Outgoing President Clinton's positive job performance rating
was 58 percent and 41 percent negative in his final days in
office, according to a recent Zogby poll.
<p>``From looking at this poll, President-elect Bush needs to
build some bridges early on,'' said pollster John Zogby,
commenting on the results of the survey.
<p>Bush's Vice President Dick Cheney did better than the
president in both the job performance rating and likability
scale.
<p>For his likability rating, 53.5 percent gave Bush a very
favorable or somewhat favorable ranking while 42 percent said
their opinion was somewhat or very unfavorable.
<p>African-Americans, who are traditionally Democrats, held the
lowest opinion of the new president, with 78.2 percent seeing him
in a somewhat unfavorable or very unfavorable light. Of the 63
African-Americans polled, only 7.9 percent had a ``very favorable''
opinion of Bush while 6.5 percent saw him ``somewhat favorably''.
<p>Quizzed about how Bush had handled the appointment of his
cabinet, 52.4 percent said he had done an excellent or good job
while 26.3 percent said he had done a fair job and 16.6 percent
said it was poor.
<p>On the issue of foreign affairs, Bush's report card was less
rosy, with 36.6 percent either certain or confident of his
performance while 33.8 percent were somewhat confident and 26.7
were not confident at all.
<p>Overall, people had a more favorable opinion of Bush's
running mate and vice president Richard Cheney than of the
president.
<p>Asked about their overall opinion of Cheney, 60 percent said
they saw him either in a very favorable or somewhat favorable
light while 14.9 percent viewed him in a somewhat unfavorable
light while 8 percent had a very unfavorable view.
<p>Cheney also had a higher job approval rating, with 48.7
percent rating his performance either as good or excellent while
20.7 percent ranked him as fair and 7 percent as poor.
<p>The margin of error was plus or minus four percent for the
poll.
