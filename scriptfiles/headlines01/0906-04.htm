foreign oil companies on Thursday of complicity in brutal human

rights abuses committed by the Khartoum government during the

country's civil war.

<p>In a statement released at the end of their week-long

annual plenary meeting in Kenya, the bishops said the war had

intensified in the last three years, thanks in part to the

government's profits from oil exports.

<p>``In Sudan, the companies are profiting from gross and

systematic violations of human rights,'' they said. ``They are

complicit as they accept the protection of regular troops and

militia who commit human rights abuses with impunity.''

<p>The bishops accused the government of displacing civilians

en masse in the south of the country to make way for oil

exploration, a charge which has also been made by international

human rights groups and some aid agencies.

<p>``We witness displacement of our flocks from their

homelands, driven away by helicopter gunships, Antonov bombers

and government troops and militias in order for oil companies

to work in relative security,'' they said.

<p>Sudan's 18-year civil war pits the mainly Christian and

animist south against the Muslim, Arab north and has cost an

estimated two million lives through conflict and famine.

<p>Foreign oil companies defend their presence in Sudan,

saying they have seen no evidence of mass displacement of

civilians and that they have helped to finance development in

the areas in which they work.

<p>But Sudan's bishops said the proceeds from oil exports were

not benefiting ordinary people.

<p>The Sudan People's Liberation Army, which is fighting for

autonomy in southern Sudan, says it considers foreign oil

companies legitimate targets, and last month attacked the

Heglig facilities in an attempt to shut down oil operations.

<p>The bishops asked other episcopal conferences around the

world to appeal to their governments, oil companies, banks and

other enterprises to refrain from doing businesses with Sudan's

oil industry before peace is reached.</p>
