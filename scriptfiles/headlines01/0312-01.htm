Less than two months after George Bush's inauguration there are signs that the secretary of state, Colin Powell, is losing the struggle to shape key foreign and defence policies. 
<P>Mr Powell seems out of step with his Pentagon and White House colleagues on a range of issues, including Korea, Kosovo, Iraq and European defence, raising the fear in foreign capitals that the Bush administration is not speaking with one voice on vital issues.  
<P>The most visible example came last week when Mr Powell said that the Republican team intended to pick up the Clinton policy of cautious engagement with North Korea.  
<P>He made a humiliating u-turn the next day after President Bush said that he had no intention of resuming talks with Pyongyang, to the dismay of South Korea's visiting president, Kim Dae-jung.  
<P>Mr Powell appeared to be isolated again at the end of the week, this time on US peacekeeping in Kosovo. Two weeks   ago in Brussels, He delighted Nato ministers with a declaration that the US and its allies had "gone in together" and would "come out together".  
<P>But the defence secretary, Donald Rumsfeld, conspicuously avoided any such pledge at a Washington press conference with the Nato secretary general, Lord Robertson, on Thursday.  
<P>On Iraq, Mr Powell clearly indicated that Washington supported the reformulation of the sanctions policy in favour of narrower "smart" sanctions on military-related imports.  
<P>But that line was not echoed by his harder-line colleagues, including Mr Rumsfeld and Vice-President Dick Cheney.  
<P>Mr Powell has also appeared readier than Mr Rumsfeld or Mr Cheney to welcome the European rapid-reaction defence force, even though Mr Bush himself appeared to side with Mr Powell during talks with Tony Blair at Camp David last month.  
<P>Mr Powell suffered a severe defeat at the outset when he failed to have his ally Richard   Armitage appointed deputy defence secretary under Mr Rumsfeld.  
<P>Mr Bush appointed Paul Wolfowitz, a key Cheney ally who, along with Mr Rumsfeld, keenly supports the overthrow of Saddam Hussein: a stance Mr Powell opposes.  
<P>Mr Powell also opposed one of Mr Bush's first foreign policy initiatives - the ban on US funding of international groups supporting abortion services.  
<P>Senior British diplomatic sources say that it is too soon to pronounce Mr Powell the loser, but the split has become the focus of increasing attention in the US media.  
<P>Last week the senior New York Times foreign affairs specialist Thomas Friedman said there was a battle between "hard-nosed internationalists" such as Mr Powell and "ideologically driven hardliners" such as Mr Rumsfeld and Mr Cheney.  
<P>"Which is Mr Bush's approach?" Mr Friedman wrote. "You have to wonder whether Mr Bush knows."
