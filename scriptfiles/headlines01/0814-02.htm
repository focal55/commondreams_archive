            WASHINGTON, Aug. 13 &#0151; With three justices taking the rare step 

            of disqualifying themselves because of their ties to a murder victim's 

            son, an evenly divided Supreme Court today turned down a request for 

            a stay of execution from a Texas inmate who is scheduled to be put 

            to death on Wednesday.

<P> The justices, Antonin Scalia, David H. Souter and Clarence Thomas, 

              all have professional relationships with J. Michael Luttig, a prominent 

              federal appeals court judge whose father was murdered in a botched 

              carjacking in Texas in 1994. </P>

            <P> Mr. Luttig clerked for Justice Scalia and advised Justices Souter 

              and Thomas in confirmation hearings. </P>

            <P> Legal scholars said the court now found itself in a situation 

              that the founding fathers hoped to avoid by creating a Supreme Court 

              with an odd number of members. </P>

            <P> Because a majority is needed for a stay of execution, the court's 

              3-to-3 decision was a defeat for the death row inmate, Napoleon 

              Beazley. </P>

            <P> Justices John Paul Stevens, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen G. 

              Breyer voted to grant the stay, the court's three-paragraph order 

              said. Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, and Justices Anthony M. 

              Kennedy and Sandra Day O'Connor voted to deny it. </P>

            <P> An hour after the court's action, the Texas Board of Pardons and 

              Paroles turned down Mr. Beazley's request for clemency by a vote 

              of 10 to 6. The six votes for clemency is one of the highest numbers 

              that a death row applicant has received from the board, which has 

              granted clemency in only one capital case since Texas resumed executing 

              inmates in 1982.</P>

            <P> Mr. Beazley's case has drawn international attention, especially 

              from groups opposed to executing offenders who commit their crimes 

              before the age of 18, including the European Union. Mr. Beazley 

              was 17 when he shot John Luttig, a Tyler, Tex., businessman, twice 

              in the head in his driveway during a botched carjacking.</P>

            <P> One of the parole board members, Filiberto Reyna, said he voted 

              with the majority in denying commutation because he said the brutality 

              of the crime demanded a death sentence. </P>

            <P> He discounted arguments by Mr. Beazley's lawyers that key testimony 

              in the trial had been invalidated by the decision of two co-defendants 

              to recant part of their statements. </P>

            <P> "I'm convinced it was premeditated, I'm convinced he knew what 

              he was doing," Mr. Reyna said. "It's extremely unfortunate that 

              we have such young members of our society involved in such offenses, 

              and I believe that it's a very poor commentary on our society. But 

              I still believe the nature of the offense warrants the punishment 

              imposed in this case."</P>

            <P> Another board member, Paddy Burwell, said he voted in favor of 

              commutation because of his concerns about the fairness of the trial 

              convinced him that the death penalty was too harsh. "I don't think 

              he's innocent," Mr. Burwell said. "I don't think he claims to be 

              innocent. But if you consider all the factors, it's not the right 

              thing to do." </P>

            <P> Mr. Beazley still has pending a motion before the Supreme Court 

              to review his case on the merits, including the question of whether 

              the constitution bars the execution of someone who was under the 

              age of 18 when he committed the crime. </P>

            <P> It takes four members of a nine- member Supreme Court to agree 

              to review a case on its merits. But with three justices having recused 

              themselves, the six-member court will be proceeding on largely uncharted 

              waters as it decides how many votes are necessary to grant Mr. Beazley's 

              motion.</P>

            <P> "The court has been haunted in the past by situations like this," 

              said Richard Pildes, a former Supreme Court clerk and now a professor 

              of constitutional law at New York University Law School. "One of 

              the reasons the court has an odd number of members is precisely 

              to avoid situations like this, where major issues are decided by 

              a tie vote, particularly in capital cases," he added.</P>

            <P> A vote of a majority of justices is required for a stay of execution, 

              which would be five in normal cases, and four in this case, with 

              only six justices sitting. In 1985, the court denied a stay of execution 

              to a Georgia death row inmate, Roosevelt Green, on a 4-to-4 vote, 

              with Justice Lewis F. Powell Jr. not voting because of illness. 

              That a man could be executed on a tie vote brought tremendous criticism 

              on the court, Mr. Pildes said.</P>

            <P> Today, the head of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund 

              Inc. and a veteran death penalty lawyer, George Kendall, said, "A 

              tie shouldn't go to the executioner."</P>

            <P> The problem for the court is compounded, Mr. Pildes and other 

              legal scholars said, when there are not enough votes for a stay, 

              but enough votes on the court to hear a case on the merits. Only 

              four votes are required for the court to grant a motion to review 

              a case.</P>

            <P> This sets up the possibility that there are enough votes to hear 

              a case on the merits, but not enough to stop the execution so that 

              such a hearing can held. Mr. Pildes said that in the past justices 

              have recognized that this would cast the Supreme Court in a bad 

              light, and so some justices have therefore voted for a stay even 

              when they did not think the inmate's assertions were meritorious.</P>

            <P> The rule on how many votes are needed for a review on the merits 

              is set by the court, and because the situation of the court having 

              only six members is so rare, Supreme Court officials and legal scholars 

              were scrambling today to determine how many votes would be needed 

              in this case. In a 1971, with two vacancies on the court, Justice 

              William O. Douglas expressed his opinion that only three votes were 

              needed to grant a petition for review, in a case involving constitutional 

              questions about the rights of a Jehovah's Witness to avoid military 

              conscription.</P>

            <P> Legal scholars and death penalty lawyers said today that they 

              were not aware of an instance in which a single justice had disqualified 

              himself in a death penalty case, let alone three.</P>

            <P> A Supreme Court spokesman said a federal statute governed justices 

              in recusal matters. The law says a justice "shall disqualify himself 

              in any proceeding in which his impartiality might reasonably be 

              called into question."</P>

            <P> Death penalty lawyers said it was likely that the three justices 

              who voted for a stay, Justices Stevens, Ginsburg and Breyer, would 

              also vote to hear the case on the merits.</P>

            <P> The constitutional question is whether executing a juvenile offender 

              is cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment. 

              In 1989, the Supreme Court, in Stanford v. Kentucky, ruled 5 to 

              4 that it did not. The majority opinion was written by Justice Scalia. 

            </P>

            <P> Mr. Beazley's lawyers also want the court to rule that the United 

              States is bound by international law and treaties not to execute 

              a juvenile offender. In the last decade, only six other countries 

              have executed a juvenile offender — Congo, Iran, Nigeria, Pakistan, 

              Saudi Arabia and Yemen — a report by Amnesty International said.</P>

            <P> Separate from the Supreme Court, Mr. Beazley's case will now be 

              reviewed by Gov. Rick Perry. Under Texas law, Mr. Perry has only 

              two options now that the parole board has rejected commutation; 

              he can either grant a one-time 30-day stay or allow the execution 

              to proceed. Mr. Long, the appellate lawyer, said he hoped that Mr. 

              Perry would be swayed by the dissenters on the parole board. "I 

              do think that the governor should look closely at the fact that 

              there were six board members who voted for a commutation in the 

              case and 10 who voted not to," Mr. Long said. </P>

            <P> He also said he planned to file a motion with the Texas Court 

              of Criminal Appeals seeking a stay.
