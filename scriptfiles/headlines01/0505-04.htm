LARANDIA ARMY BASE, Colombia   -- U.S. Green Beret trainers

watched proudly as Colombian troops reacted to an ''ambush'' with a

withering blast of gunfire and by hurling hand grenades.

<p>

   The aggressive response during training exercises -- opened for

the first time to journalists on Friday -- was one the U.S. Special

Forces have been instilling into their charges, who will soon

combat drug trafficking in an area swarming with rebels and

paramilitaries.<p>

</table></font>The battalion will finish its months-long training in this

sprawling jungle base on May 24, and will join two other

counternarcotics battalions -- a total of 3,000 soldiers -- that have

been trained by the Green Berets since April 1999.<p>

   Amid criticism from human rights groups and even the U.S. State

Department that Colombian security forces have a poor human rights

record, the U.S. Embassy investigated each of the 3,000 soldiers to

make sure they have not been accused of abuses or drug trafficking.<p>

   But they will likely be conducting joint anti-drug operations

with Colombian counterguerrilla battalions which have not undergone

such scrutiny -- and which have a reputation of maintaining covert

links with the paramilitary United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia,

which has been massacring suspected rebel collaborators.<p>

   Under a brooding gray sky, the Green Berets -- from the 7th

Special Forces Group based in Fort Bragg, N.C. -- watched their

students stealthily approach a mock drug lab manned by soldiers

pretending to be rebels and peasant farmers who were processing

coca leaves into cocaine.<p>

   The bit of Hollywood theatrics was eerie, considering that not

far from the perimeter of this huge base in southern Caqueta state

there are real coca labs guarded by rebels.<p>

   ''We are troops of the counternarcotics battalion! You are

completely surrounded,'' shouted one of the Colombian soldiers

after his squad had closed in.<p>

   A ''rebel'' clad in a dark green uniform and black rubber boots

opened fire, and was immediately cut down by the soldiers, who

rushed into the muddy clearing. A furious exchange of gunfire,

using blanks, ensued.<p>

   The U.S. trainers, clad in camouflage fatigues and wearing

floppy ''boonie'' hats, said they try to instill ''target

discrimination'' in their students, in the hope they will not blow

away noncombatants in real action.<p>

   ''That's the only thing we can do, really. When people are in

the area we're expecting them to identify them before they shoot,''

explained a trainer. ''It's not just spray -- it's identify and then

engage.''<p>

   Army Gen. Mario Montoya, the commander of Colombia's southern

region where the U.S.-trained battalions will be based, rejected

allegations by human rights groups that some army units are

fighting a dirty war against rebels.<p>

   ''If we were as bloodthirsty as people say, the war would have

been over by now -- we would have killed all the bad guys,'' Montoya

declared.<p>

   The newly trained troops will join the other two

counternarcotics battalions in operations against coca plantations

and drug labs, mostly in Putumayo and Caqueta states, which

together produce more than 60 percent of Colombia's cocaine.<p>

   The U.S backing of Colombia's military, which has been fighting

a 37-year war against rebels, has some critics suspecting the

assistance is more geared at helping wipe out the rebellion instead

of stemming drug trafficking.<p>

   Since the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia -- the biggest

rebel group -- earns millions of dollars by protecting and taxing

drug crops, as do the rival paramilitaries, the U.S.-trained troops

will have wide clearance to launch attacks.<p>

   A U.S. military official based in Colombia, speaking on

condition of customary anonymity, said the U.S.-trained troops can

target any of the thousands of rebels and paramilitary gunmen in

Putumayo and Caqueta, because he asserted they are there only to

make money off the drug trade.<p>

   The anti-drug troops provide protection for low-flying

fumigation planes and seek out and destroy drug labs. The two

battalions have destroyed 86,000 acres of coca and killed 52

''narcotraffickers'' since December, Montoya said. He did not give

a breakdown on how many of the dead were rebels and paramilitaries.<p>

   In the clashes, one officer, three non-commissioned officers and

six privates have been slain, Montoya said.<p>

   Under the $1.3 billion U.S. aid package, 16 Blackhawk and 25

Super Huey helicopters will begin arriving in July for the

counternarcotics battalions.<p>

   They will give the battalions far greater mobility and fire

support, the U.S. military official said.<p>

   ''We'll be able to double the rate of success we're having now,

and that's a modest estimate,'' he predicted.
