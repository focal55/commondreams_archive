WASHINGTON  - Labor rights activists are suing Coca- 

Cola, the giant US-based multinational beverage company, for the  

killings and intimidation of union leaders at several of its  

bottling plants in Colombia. 

<P>

The lawsuit, to be filed Friday in a Miami federal court, charges  

that Coke, by failing to prevent its bottlers in Colombia from  

bringing in right-wing paramilitary death squads to break up  

unions at its plants, bears responsibility for the abuses,  

including murder and torture, under both US and state law. <P>

A Coca-Cola spokesman, Rafael Fernandez, said the Atlanta-based  

company was not at fault. ''We deny any wrongdoing regarding human  

rights in Colombia or anywhere else,'' he said, adding that the  

company had no ''specific information'' regarding abuses at its  

bottling plants there. 

<P>

Also named as defendants in the lawsuit, which is being brought by  

the United Steel Workers of America (USWA) and the Washington- 

based International Labor Rights Fund (ILRF), are the bottlers  

themselves, Miami-based Panamco and Bebidas y Alimentos, a company  

owned by Richard Kirby and his son, Richard Kirby Keilland, both  

US citizens living in Key Biscayne, Florida. 

<P>

No one answered the phone listed for the Kirbys, while a Panamco  

employee said that its management was attending a board meeting  

and was unavailable for comment. <P>

Plaintiffs include SINALTRAINAL, a Colombian trade union that  

represents workers at a number of beverage and food companies in  

Colombia; the survivors of Isidro Segundo Gil, who was murdered by  

paramilitary forces inside the Carepa bottling plant in 1995' and  

several other union members who allegedly have been subjected to  

the paramilitaries' campaign of violence and intimidation. 

<P>

The case is being brought in part to highlight the appalling  

plight of Colombian labor unionists, several thousand of whom  

have been murdered over the past 15 years - a record that has  

drawn the attention of the International Labor Organization  

(ILO), among others. 

<P>

''There has been a very concerted campaign against trade unionists  

for many years and it seems to have even stepped up in recent  

months,'' according to Robin Kirk, a Colombia expert at Human  

Rights Watch. <P>

''Of every five trade unionists murdered in the world, three are  

Colombian,'' said Dan Kovalik, a USWA lawyer. He said more than 50  

trade union leaders have been killed so far this year, including  

Oscar Dario Soto Polo, an employee and union official at a Coca- 

Cola bottling plant in Monertia who was gunned down Jun 21. <P>

The case also is being brought as the US House of Representatives  

this week considers a request by President George W. Bush to add  

some 400 million dollars in economic and military aid to 1.3  

billion dollars already approved for 'Plan Colombia,' an effort to  

help government forces gain control of coca-growing regions. <P>

The request has run into unexpectedly strong resistance,  

especially among Democrats, who are concerned that the money would  

only fuel abuses, particularly by right-wing paramilitary forces  

that have been supported by military commanders in the past. 

<P>

The paramilitaries, which human rights groups claim are  

responsible for most of the violence in Colombia, have often acted  

as hired guns for big landowners and private companies, precisely  

to discourage workers from organizing.

<P>

The case is based primarily on the Alien Tort Claims Act, a 200- 

year-old law that permits foreigners to sue anyone for damages  

arising from grave human rights abuses committed abroad. The only  

constraint is that defendants must be served on US territory. 

<P>

The Act has been used with striking success in gaining big  

judgments against individuals, including about a dozen foreign  

heads of state and senior military officers, in lawsuits brought  

over the past 15 years. Its use against corporations is relatively  

untested. 

<P>

The ILRF helped bring a suit against UNOCAL, the California-based  

energy company, for its alleged complicity with Burma's military  

government in drafting forced labor to build a pipeline, but that  

case remains in the courts. Last month, it filed another case  

against Exxon-Mobil for Mobil's alleged backing for military  

abuses in Aceh, Indonesia. 

<P>

At the Carepa bottling plant, according to the 60-page complaint,  

paramilitary forces murdered two activists in April 1994 and then  

were invited by management at Bebidos y Alimentos to come onto the  

premises to threaten other members of the local SINALTRAINAL  

leadership if they did not resign from the union or flee the town  

altogether. In 1995, every member of the union's executive board  

left. <P>

When the union elected a new board, management hired members of  

the paramilitaries to work in the sales and production  

departments. They carried out a campaign of intimidation that  

included death threats against specific board members and  

culminated in the murder inside the plant of Isidro Segundo Gil in  

Dec 1996. 

<P>

At Panamco's Coca-Cola plant in Bucaramanga, the plaintiffs allege  

that five members of the local union executive board were falsely  

accused in 1996 of planting a bomb on the premises during a labor  

dispute, were badly beaten by local police, and were incarcerated  

in terrible conditions for six months before the regional  

prosecutor found that the charges were groundless and ordered them  

released. 

<P>

At Panamco's Cucata and Barrancabermeja plants, the local union  

officials have been forced into hiding after receiving death  

threats, from paramilitaries beginning in 1999, in connection with  

their union work. In Barrancabermeja, plant management has openly  

collaborated with and supported the paramilitaries, according to  

the complaint. <P>

In each case, the union repeatedly asked Coca-Cola Colombia and  

the bottling company's management for protection. ''Coke did  

nothing,'' said Kovalik. <P>

In all these cases, according to Terry Collingsworth, ILRF's chief  

attorney, the bottlers effectively acted as Coca-Cola's agent due  

to the degree of control the soft drink company exercised over  

their operations under the standard bottling contract. <P>

''We are confident that if any of these plants make a mistake in  

applying Coca-Cola's formula or in delivering Coke, they would be  

there to correct it,'' said Kovalik. ''But in cases where they  

kill union leaders, they do nothing.'' <P>

Collingsworth pointed out that, in a similar case in Guatemala 20  

years ago, Coke arranged for the bottling plant owner, John  

Trotter, to sell his franchise. Trotter was accused of using death  

squads to kill several union officials between 1978 and 1979.  

After the sale, the repression at the plant ceased. <P>

But in the case of the Carepa plant, Coke turned down an offer by  

the Kirbys to sell the plant in 1997, despite reports that the  

elder Kirby had specifically threatened to kill union leaders  

before Gil's death. <P>

''There is no question that Coke knew about and benefited from the  

systematic repression of trade union rights at its bottling plants  

in Colombia, and this case will make the company accountable,''  

said Collingsworth. <P>

Coke's Fernandez denied, however, that the company received ''any  

notice from Colombian police or anybody of any wrongdoing'' in any  

of the plants. ''It is not true that the agreement (between the  

bottlers and the company) gives us control,'' he added, noting  

that Coke expects all its employees and associates to abide by a  

business code of conduct dating back to 1980.
