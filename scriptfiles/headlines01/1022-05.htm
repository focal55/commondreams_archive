WASHINGTON   - Arab League Secretary General Amr

Moussa said on Monday that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict was

a root cause of the Arab anger that gives ``terrorists'' a chance

to hide behind a legitimate cause.

<p>After the United States deals with Saudi-born militant

Osama bin Laden, the target of the U.S. military campaign in

Afghanistan, it should move on to resolve the conflict, he told

a Washington lunch organized by the Arab American Institute.

<p>``Only by resolving ongoing conflicts can we effectively

deprive terrorists of hiding behind legitimate causes and

gaining sympathizers,'' he said.

<p>``Phase two of the international effort should focus on the

root causes of terrorism. Frustration, despair and anger are

sentiments which, if unchecked, can be channeled into

destructive acts,'' added the former Egyptian foreign minister.

<p>``The anger in the Middle East, the frustration and despair,

emanate chiefly from the major injustice done to the

Palestinians and other Arabs and the continued occupation and

seeing no light at the end of the tunnel,'' he said.

<p>Israel says that, on the contrary, violence by Palestinian

groups should be the next target of the U.S. campaign, which

opened early this month with air strikes on Afghanistan.

<p>The United States accuses bin Laden and his al Qaeda

organization of planning the Sept. 11 suicide hijackings which

killed nearly 5,400 people in New York and Washington.

<p>It says it intends to target all ``terrorist groups of

global reach'' but has not specified which ones it has in mind.

<p>In the meantime, Washington is trying to muster Arab

support for its campaign against bin Laden by saying it is not

waging war on the Arab and Muslim worlds.

<p>WITHDRAWAL TO 1967 BORDERS

<p>Moussa said: ``If we are serious about the security of the

world... we must all concede that reaching a just,

comprehensive and balanced settlement ( between Israelis and

Palestinians) is an imperative.''

<p>Middle East peace should be based on ``relevant Security

Council resolutions and the principle of land for peace'' he

said, reiterating the standard Arab League position.

<p>This should include Israeli withdrawal to the 1967 borders,

a viable Palestinian state and a fair solution for Jerusalem

and for Palestinian refugees, he said.

<p>``What we need is a serious process, one whose outcome is

known and agreed and defined... Time is of the essence. We need

to work quickly,'' he added.

<p>Israel and the United States say the outcome should emerge

through direct negotiations, not be defined in advance.

<p>Moussa said he understood American anger at the attacks of

Sept. 11 but was deeply concerned at the humanitarian situation

in Afghanistan, where a crisis is looming over deliveries of

food after three years of drought. The U.S. air strikes have

frightened off some relief aid truck drivers.

<p>``I call for the protection of innocent civilians and

addressing the plight of refugees. I agree with what Secretary

Powell (Secretary of State Colin Powell) expressed yesterday

concerning the hope that this campaign comes to an end soon,''

he added.

<p>Asked whether he thought that the shortage of democracy in

the Arab world was also a root cause of frustration, Moussa

said that this was not the issue after Sept. 11.

<p>``There is one thing above all that is looming over, with

despair, and that is the Palestinian question. Many things

depend on it,'' he said.
