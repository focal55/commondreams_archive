GENEVA - Top United Nations officials have issued  

urgent appeals to governments around the world, exhorting them to  

be more flexible in order to prevent the failure of the upcoming  

World Conference against Racism. 

<P>

   ''We are now at the stage where we need to begin reaching  

agreements,'' stressed the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights,  

Mary Robinson, Tuesday. 

<P>

   The World Conference against Racism, Racial Discrimination,  

Xenophobia and Related Intolerance is set for Aug 31 to Sep 7 in  

Durban, South Africa. But there is still no agreement on the  

content of the final declaration or the program of action that  

are to be adopted by the delegates to the conference. 

<P>

   Irreconcilable differences revolve around questions of  

reparations for human rights abuses committed during slavery and  

colonial eras, and of attempts to equate Zionism with racism. <P>

   The final attempt to hammer out agreements on these matters  

will be in the hands of the preparatory committee during two weeks  

of deliberations in Geneva, beginning Jul 30. 

<P>

   Robinson acknowledged that the drafting of the conference  

declaration and program of action has not been a simple process. 

<P>

   The Group of 21, a body with the sole mission of conducting a  

''technical cleanup'' of the documents - not of carrying out  

negotiations - will present the final Durban conference drafts  

Monday to the preparatory committee. <P>

   The group, presided by South Africa, is made up of Barbados,  

Brazil, Chile and Mexico, representing Latin America and the  

Caribbean. The African bloc consists of Kenya, Nigeria, Senegal  

and Tunisia, while Canada, France, Sweden and the United States  

are the ''Western'' bloc. <P>

   Eastern Europe is represented by the Czech Republic, Croatia,  

Macedonia and Russia. The nations from Asia participating in the  

talks are India, Iran, Pakistan and Iraq <P>

   The mission of the document ''cleanup'' team has been bogged  

down by the delicate nature of the matters to be debated at the  

Durban conference. <P>

   Robinson commented Tuesday before the UN Economic and Social  

Council (ECOSOC) that the World Conference against Racism will  

cover ''not just matters of domestic policy and practice but, in  

some cases, fundamental issues of national identity.'' <P>

   ''While individual societies have embarked on processes of  

reflection and reconciliation, we as a global community have never  

attempted it before,'' she pointed out. <P>

   UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan issued an appeal to ''find ways  

to acknowledge the past without getting lost there; and to help  

heal old wounds without reopening them.'' <P>

   In a further attempt to exert pressure on the world's  

governments, the High Commissioner is slated to meet in Geneva Aug  

3 with a group of ''Eminent Persons'', led by former South African  

president, Nelson Mandela. <P>

   Among other notables, the group also includes former  

presidents, such as Jimmy Carter, of the United States, Mikhail  

Gorbachov, of the now-defunct Soviet Union, and Oscar Arias, of  

Costa Rica. <P>

   UN officials close to the process are confident that the  

arguments of these personalities, to be expressed during a round- 

table discussion, will influence the governmental delegates  

gathered in a nearby hall to discuss the final documents for  

Durban. <P>

   The UN sources also believe that the run-up to the Durban  

conference has already proven successful because it has ''engaged  

individuals and civil society as much as states.'' 

<P>

   ''The enormous response from NGOs (non-governmental  

organizations) has made it clear that Durban will not be a dry  

political gathering dominated by technical negotiations,'' said  

Robinson. 

<P>

   In the South African city, there will be an enriching gathering  

of peoples and cultures, alongside an inspiring exchange of ideas  

and experiences, predicted the High Commissioner. <P>

   In addition to the Conference against Racism, an NGO Forum is  

slated to meet in Durban Aug 28 to Sep 1, and a Youth Summit on  

Aug 26 and 27. 

<P>

   Robinson stressed that during the preparatory phase of the  

conference, ''the profile of racism as a global issue has been  

raised to an unprecedented level. The regional preparatory  

meetings have recognized that racism is a problem in every country  

and every region.'' 

<P>

   She expressed confidence that the conference will ultimately be  

a success, though said she is sure that ''no country or group will  

walk away completely satisfied.'' <P>

   ''At a time when the international community is grappling with  

so many complex global problems, we simply cannot afford to fail  

to find consensus on an issue as clear-cut as racism,'' asserted  

the High Commissioner. <P>

   The minimum objectives of the UN for the Durban conference  

include a declaration that ''solemnly acknowledges the wrongs of  

the past, notes the current manifestations of racism, racial  

discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance.'' <P>

   The document must also commit governments to ''moving forward  

together in the fight against racism.'' 

<P>

   A second goal is a program of action that outlines practical  

steps for fulfilling these commitments. 

<P>

   Finally, the UN intends to forge an alliance between  

governments and civil society ''that will enable the struggle  

against racism to be carried beyond Durban.''
