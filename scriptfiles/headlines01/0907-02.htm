GENOA, ITALY --

His landslide election in May left Italian Prime Minister Silvio 

Berlusconi looking like Europe's latest reincarnation of Margaret Thatcher.

<P>The autocratic conservative, nicknamed "the Cavalryman" (Il Cavaliere), 

promised a 100-day revolution that would transform his nation's flagging 

economy with efficient business methods and bolster its international profile 

with decisive, unflinching governance.

<P>No one imagined that Berlusconi, who built an immense corporate and media 

empire before entering politics, would soon find himself tottering helplessly 

on the battlefield of globalization.

<P>Then came the July G-8 summit in this ancient port city. The violent 

confrontations between anti-globalization protesters and police left one 

demonstrator dead, 351 people wounded, 301 arrested -- and the Cavalryman's 

administration reeling.

<P>

</font>"His own ministers quarrel among themselves from morning to night," said 

leftist opposition leader Francesco Rutelli, with barely concealed delight. 

"Che bruta figura!"

<P>This withering insult -- which roughly translates as "what a lousy 

impression" -- has come to symbolize a government that has produced virtually 

no legislation, much less a new Italy.

<P>Instead Italians are being treated to endless waves of back-stabbing and 

recrimination over the G-8 debacle and the government's collective shudder at 

the prospect of two more summits planned for Italy this autumn. A repeat of 

the Genoa events at either of them, Berlusconi and his aides fear, could 

virtually kill the new administration.

<P>Defense ministers of 19 North Atlantic Treaty Organization countries are 

scheduled to meet for two days in Naples later this month. Then in early 

November, the U.N. Food and Agricultural Organization is scheduled to hold a 

four-day World Food Summit at the FAO's headquarters in Rome to discuss global 

malnutrition and famine.

<P>"Scheduled" is the operative word. As recently as a week ago, Berlusconi's 

government was desperately hoping that another country would take the summits 

off its hands -- until its NATO allies and U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan 

flatly declared that they had no intention of transferring their events beyond 

Italy's borders.

<P>With an audible sigh, Berlusconi conceded that Italy would host the summits 

as planned, but he is determined to shift them away from the urban centers of 

Rome and Naples.

<P>The NATO meeting is likely to wind up behind the barbed wire of a military 

base, or on a remote island off the Italian coast. However, the United Nations 

is adamant that its summit be held in a publicly accessible venue, within easy 

reach of an international airport. A joint FAO-Italian government commission 

is studying the alternatives.

<P>In the meantime, not a single logistical measure has been taken to prepare 

for the arrival of 100 chiefs of state and 7,000 participants, representing 

150 nations and 630 nongovernmental organizations, along with an estimated 2,

500 journalists.

<P>In the latest twist, the government has proposed the town of Fiuggi -- a 

luxurious thermal bath resort outside of Rome -- for a summit dedicated to 

world hunger.

<P>A second possibility, the castle of Spoleto, was boosted by a local 

politician who pointed out that it was "located on a hill . . . surrounded by 

an imposing wall of granite."

<P>A third proposed site, the thermal spa of Salsomaggiore, was withdrawn from 

consideration because the summit would have had to share facilities with the 

Miss Italy Contest.

<P>At one point, Berlusconi had suggested that the FAO summit "be transferred 

to Africa," where most protesters would presumably find it difficult to travel.

<P>He drifted into pained silence at the resulting storm of ridicule, much of 

which came from within the ranks of his own right-wing coalition.

<P>Adding to Il Cavaliere's woes are the no fewer than 12 separate inquests 

and pretrial hearings set in motion by the G-8 melee. The most controversial 

opened in Genoa on Aug. 28, when 16 police officers were placed under formal 

investigation on charges that include manslaughter and attempted homicide.

<P>In Rome, meanwhile, a parade of law enforcement officials have been fired, 

including the former police commissioner of Genoa, the former state anti-

terrorism chief and the former vice director of police operations.

<P>Testifying for 11 hours before a parliamentary commission, the common 

thread in the accounts given by the officials -- apart from blaming each other 

-- was that Berlusconi's interior ministry micromanaged the summit's security 

measures from Rome, while insisting for public consumption that policing was 

overseen by the municipal authorities of Genoa.

<P>"Perhaps the truth is beginning to emerge," one of Berlusconi's own 

commissioners at the hearing admitted.

<P>Meanwhile, Italian leaders of the anti-globalization movement told 

reporters that at least 50,000 protesters would show up in Naples, even if the 

NATO delegates were locked up on a military base or exiled to an offshore 

island.</p>
