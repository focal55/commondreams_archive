            LONDON - US defense policy has forced Greenpeace to refocus its protests 

            against nuclear weapons -- the very issue which fueled its formation 

            30 years ago, executive director Gerd Leipold said Thursday.

                  Embassy in Bern, Switzerland Monday, Aug. 13, 2001. Some 30 

                  activists staged a demonstration titled &quot;Stop Star Wars 

                  not Greenpeace&quot; to protest against the U.S. plans for an 

                  anti-missile shield and demand to dismiss legal proceedings 

                  against 15 Greenpeace activists, who were demonstrating at the 

                  U.S. Air Force base in Vandenberg, southern California, in July

            </font></font>As the environmental pressure group looks ahead to its 

            30th anniversary next month, Leipold said US president George W. Bush's 

            "Star Wars" missile defense program had forced Greenpeace to turn 

            full circle.

<p>

            The organization 

            was formed on September 15, 1971, when a group of campaigners left 

            Vancouver harbor for Amchitka, off the Alaskan coast, to protest against 

            US nuclear testing. 

            <p>Almost three decades on in July 2001, activists sailed to the Vandenburg 

              airbase in California where the US military was about to launch 

              a missile test as part of its defense program</p>

            <p>Fifteen campaigners and two journalists were arrested at the scene 

              and were on Monday charged with conspiracy in a Californian court. 

              They are due to go on trial next month.</p>

            <p>Speaking at the launch of Greenpeace's annual report in London, 

              Leipold said: "After the end of the Cold War the opposition to nuclear 

              weapons was less important for a while. But we can't say that any 

              more, with the Bush administration's modernization program</p>

            <p>"We are reacting to a change in big politics. We are picking up 

              where we were quite active 10 to 12 years ago."</p>

            <p>He said Bush was putting the world at risk by a "truly astonishing 

              policy path that could undo so much progress in environmental protection 

              and world peace."</p>

            <p>Leipold attacked the Bush administration's plans to withdraw from 

              the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, which prohibits a national 

              missile defense and tests done from the water or from the air.</p>

            <p>He also criticized Bush for rejecting the Kyoto Protocol on global 

              warming earlier this year.</p>

            <p>Looking back over the organization's history, Leipold said Greenpeace 

              had proved it was unique in the way it sought to be a positive force 

              for change.</p>

            <p>With membership growing six percent on last year to 2.65 million, 

              its voice has never been stronger, he added.</p>

            <p>Highlights in 2001 alone include an agreement in April to save 

              several large areas of Canada's Great Bear rainforest and the adoption 

              in May of a convention that aims to stop the production and use 

              of persistent organic pollutants.</p>

            <p>Leipold said he wanted to see Greenpeace become even more international.</p>

            <p>"I am firmly committed to making Greenpeace a more global organization</p>

            <p>"I want to maintain Greenpeace as an action organization -- an 

              organization that puts its actions where its heart is, that is at 

              the scene of the crime."
