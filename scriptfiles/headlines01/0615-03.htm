Prince Andrew last night provoked anger among environmentalists and suggestions of a split at the palace when it emerged that Britain's future roving trade ambassador will be giving a keynote speech at the opening of the world's premier trade fair for the biotechnology industry. 

<P>The prince will be one of the most high profile speakers for Bio2001, the largest annual gathering of the world's biotech industry, in San Diego on June 25.  

<P>The event is sponsored by, among others, the world's leading GM food manufacturers, including Monsanto, Aventis, Dow AgroSciences and Astra Zeneca, and is or ganised by the Biotechnology Industry Organisation, which promotes GM foods.  

<P>Merck and Bayer, two of the corporations who recently tried to stop via the courts the South African government distributing cheap generic Aids drugs, are also sponsoring the event.  

<P>The prince's visit, arranged by the Foreign Office after a request from the conference organisers, will inevitably lead to a clash with his elder brother, the Prince of Wales, who has condemned GM technology in foods.  

<P>Prince Andrew is expected to stay clear of speaking about biotechnology in agriculture.  

<P>He is talking at a breakfast meeting on the first day sponsored by Johnson &amp; Johnson, one of the world's largest phar maceutical companies. Last night Buckingham palace said: "The Foreign Office has looked at his programme very closely. He will be supporting a wide range of British companies who will be at the trade fair.  

<P>"He will be speaking in general support of trade and will not be commenting in a policy-setting context about the biotech industry."  

<P>British companies who will be present include Burson Marsteller, which has done the corporate PR for Monsanto and Shell in Britain and is one of the main sponsors of the conference.  

<P>Last night Charlie Kronick of Greenpeace said it was inevitable that the prince's visit would be interpreted as a public relations coup for the biotech industry in the US, which has been damaged by European opposition to the the introduction of the technology in agriculture.  

<P>Its introduction into pharmaceuticals is less controversial.  

<P>"This will inevitably be widely reported as a royal stamp of approval for the GM industry", said Mr Kronick. "It's incredible that this government is underwriting him to push a technology that they cannot give away at home. He should abandon his visit."  

<P>The pre-conference publicity says that the prince has long been a patron of healthcare related charities in Britain, including the British Deaf Association, the Royal Commonwealth Society for the Deaf, and Fight for Sight.
