LIVERMORE --  

Outsiders would presume that impassioned Berkeley-type bumper stickers 

wouldn't go over too well in Livermore, the Tri-Valley city that definitely 

hugs with its nuclear arms and probably wouldn't think that one nuclear bomb 

(OK, OK an undetonated one) would spoil its whole day.

<P>Yesterday morning, though, Livermore motorists crossing the intersection of 

Portola Road and Murrieta Boulevard near the Interstate 580 onramp could not 

help but notice the eye-popping 24-foot billboard that would have seemed more 

fitting on Telegraph Avenue.

<P>No, not Panda Express' giant shrimp speared by a chopstick. Check the other 

side.

<P>There, next to an ominous black-and-white photograph of the target chamber 

of the National Ignition Facility at Lawrence Livermore Laboratory, is a 

message in blood red letters: "Nuclear Weapons Science? NIF is intended to 

train a new generation of bomb designers." Then there's this all-caps kicker, 

aimed specificly at the 8,000 employees of the Lab: "Your mind is a terrible 

thing to waste."

<P>This is the work of a group called the <a href="http://www.igc.org/tvc/" target="_new">Tri-Valley Communities Against a 

Radioactive Environment,</a> a hearty band of activists that has been tilting at 

billboards and laser projects in this nuclear company-town for years.

<P>What began humbly in 1983 with a "Food Not Bombs" bake sale outside the 

local Nob Hill Foods has mushroomed into a movement of 2,900 card-carrying 

pacifists who try their darndest to voice concerns about the Lab's work with 

nuclear arms.

<P>To most residents in the community, Tri-Valley CARES is something of a 

fifth column, saboteurs who want to derail the very engine of Livermore's 

economy.

<P>"Livermore is solidly behind the Lab and NIF," Mayor Cathie Brown said. 

"I've gone to Washington to lobby extensively for it, with the overwhelming 

support of the community. Tri-Valley CARES has a right to free speech, but I'm 

concerned with the whole community."

<P>So, too, is Marylia Kelley and her group. An unassuming woman with flowing 

red hair, Kelley could easily pass for just another Livermore homemaker. Which 

she is. But she also has a cause.

<P>"Our group exists to make visible that there's no consensus in Livermore 

about nuclear weapons," said Kelley, the founder. "I remember way back when we 

started. I woman walked up to me at the bake sale and began to cry. All she 

could say was, 'Thanks for being here. I thought I was the only one in town 

who thinks nuclear weapons are immoral.' "

<P>Tri-Valley CARES has come a long way since those bake-sale days. The $5,000 

monthly bill for the billboard, Kelley says, mostly comes from donations from 

charitable foundations and members. The group has become one of the most 

influential and dogged anti-nuke organizations in the country, with a yearly 

budget of $150,000. Last year, it was honored by the U.S. Environmental 

Protection Agency for its public participation in the agency's hazardous-waste 

cleanup activities.

<P>But Tri-Valley CARES doesn't limit itself to toxic cleanup. As its 

billboard states, it wants nothing less than Livermore scientists and 

engineers to shed their white coats and work on peaceful "civilian" projects 

either at the lab or elsewhere.

<P>Two such scientists -- Issac Trotts and Andreas Toupadakis -- were on hand 

yesterday for Tri-Valley CARES' press conference. Trotts, a computer scientist, quit the NIF in March after five months, saying he was misled about the 

program's focus. Toupadakis, a chemist who worked both at Livermore and Los 

Alamos, left a $91,000 NIF job a year ago because "they were building new 

bombs, not cleaning them up." NIF is best known for its big-budget 192-beam 

weapons-testing laser under construction, but its scientists also are stewards 

for existing weapons.

<P>Susan Houghton, spokeswoman for NIF, disputes the ex-employees' claims. She 

said that international test-ban treaties preclude the development of new 

weapons but that "as weapons deteriorate, we replace the parts with newer 

parts to ensure that the weapons will function."

<P>A lab scientist who worked with Trotts dismissed Trotts' accusation that 

new weapons are being built. "That's a classic CARES argument, but it's just 

not true," Sean Ahern said. "The actual nuclear warheads themselves have not 

changed. His definition's wrong."

<P>To Tri-Valley CARES, it's not mere semantics. Trotts and Toupadakis said 

that improving the accuracy and deadliness of existing weapons is tantamount 

to building new ones.

<P>Toupadakis, who worked for the Department of Energy for 10 years making 

sure plutonium for existing warheads remained potent decades after being 

constructed, pointed to the billboard and issued a challenge to his former lab 

workers.

<P>"My former colleagues need to ask themselves if they can still go back to 

their houses, look at their children in the eyes and continue to believe that 

they really do work for peace when they do the work for war," he said.

<P>Toupadakis has yet to land a job since his vocal departure from the lab, 

and Kelley says her group is trying to establish financial help via no-

interest loans for scientists like Toupadakis who choose to leave the 

Department of Energy.

<P>It didn't take Trotts long to find a new job, though. He leaves today for 

Boulder, Colo., where he will design video games for Sony Play Station II.

<P>"And not to worry," he added, "they are not violent video games."
