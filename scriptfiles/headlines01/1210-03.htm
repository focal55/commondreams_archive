OSLO   - At least 16 Nobel Peace Prize laureates

called for disarmament and non-violent pursuit of peace in the

21st century in a joint appeal on Monday marking the 100th

anniversary of the first Nobel award.

<p>The declaration, agreed in Oslo at the biggest gathering of

Nobel Peace Prize winners in history, also called for the

establishment of an international criminal court.<p>``We offer support for the unrelenting, patient and

non-violent pursuit of peace wherever conflicts may rage today

or tomorrow, such as the Middle East, Colombia or the Great

lakes of Africa,'' the statement said.

<p>It was issued just before U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan and the United Nations  collect the 2001 Nobel Peace Prize in

Oslo. About 30 laureates have been in Oslo in recent days.

<p>It also urged a prompt establishment of an international

criminal court, full implementation of the Universal

Declaration of Human Rights, elimination of weapons of mass

destruction and reduction and control of small arms.<p>A preliminary list, obtained by Reuters, included

signatures from 16 individuals or organizations, such as Polish

anti-communist campaigner Lech Walesa, Guatemala human rights

advocate Rigoberta Menchu and Amnesty International.<p>``Virtually everyone who is present and able to sign has

signed,'' Cora Weiss, president of the International Peace

Bureau, which won the prize in 1910, told Reuters.

<p>Others including Northern Ireland Protestant First Minister

David Trimble and South Korean President Kim Dae-jung  had not

signed, nor had U.N. agencies. Tibetan leader the Dalai Lama,

who won in 1989, was expected to sign.

<p>She said that no one had refused to sign -- some

international organizations were unable to sign because they

needed a mandate from members.

<p>Palestinian President Yasser Arafat and Israeli Foreign

Minister Shimon Peres, who won the 1994 prize with assassinated

Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, were not in Oslo, after a

recent surge in violence in the Middle East.

<p>It took the laureates five days to come out with a joint

statement after a meeting of about 30 laureates in Oslo.<p>``Once we came together there was really no resistance,'' she

said, but adding ``when you have people in the range from Lech

Walesa to Rigoberta (Menchu)...you have to have an

accommodating compromise that doesn't compromise your

principles.''<p>The statement also hailed Annan and the United Nations.
