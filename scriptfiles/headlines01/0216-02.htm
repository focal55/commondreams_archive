LONDON  - Prime Minister Tony Blair will allow US missiles to be deployed in Britain as part of Washington's controversial national defence shield, the Daily Mail reported Friday.
<p>Without giving sources, it said Blair would agree to the idea in principle when he meets new US President George W. Bush in Washington late next week.</p>
<p>Separately however, in a flurry of interviews on his final day in office, Britain's chief of defence staff warned of a "doomsday scenario" posed by the national missile defence (NMD) scheme.</p>

</font></font>Bush made support for NMD one his key campaign pledges, but it is strongly opposed by Russia, China and several European countries including France and Germany.
<p>Britain has not given an official position yet -- although analysts say it is merely playing for time before agreeing -- but the issue will come up when Blair meets Bush next Friday.</p>
<p>According to the conservative Daily Mail, Blair will tell the president he can count on British support for the NMD strategy, which would mean upgrading a radar tracking station at Fylingdales in northern England.</p>
<p>The project is designed to protect America from attack by "rogue" nations by tracking hostile missiles and shooting them down before they hit US soil.</p>
<p>The Daily Mail said senior cabinet ministers believed Britain would become a target, and so wanted the United States to allow a "forward deployment" of some missiles on British soil or in surrounding waters.</p>
<p>Such a move threatens to divide Britain's ruling Labour Party and spark a split with the rest of Europe.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the outgoing chief of defence staff General Sir Charles Guthrie warned in his interviews that NMD could ignite Russian nationalism and open a deep rift between Washington and European capitals.</p>
<p>"What really worries me, and it would be terrible, is a doomsday scenario. If the Russians became more nationalistic and the Europeans and the Americans take a different view (on NMD), then there would be a wedge between us."</p>
<p>But he said that, while NMD was "bloody expensive and extremely difficult to use," it was an inevitability because the United States was determined to have it.</p>
<p>He added: "It is extremely important the Americans talk to the Europeans, the Russians and the Chinese. They have got to have a dialogue."</p>
<p>Defence expert Paul Beaver said Britain would support NMD due to its close ties with the United States.</p>
<p>"In the end the UK will support NMD, irrespective of the government," said Beaver. "The UK will support the NMD and I think they haven't got any choice. We are so linked to the US."</p>
