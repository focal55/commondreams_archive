UNITED NATIONS - The United States on Saturday

used its veto power to kill a U.N. resolution that demanded an

immediate halt to Middle East violence and said the Palestinian

Authority  was essential to any peace process.

<p>U.S. Ambassador John Negroponte said the Security Council

resolution, sponsored by Arab states, was aimed at isolating

Israel politically and did not mention recent suicide bombings

against Israelis or those responsible for them.<p>The vote in the 15-member council was 12 to 1 with 2

abstentions, Britain and Norway. The other two Europeans on the

council, France and Ireland were among the ``yes'' votes

following two dozen speeches that spilled into the

early-morning hours.<p>The U.S. veto was the second this year on a

Palestinian-backed resolution. In March, Washington killed a

tougher measure that called for an international observer

force, which Israel opposes.<p>Saturday's resolution, sponsored by Egypt and Tunisia and

amended by France, encouraged ``all concerned to establish a

monitoring mechanism'' to help ease conditions in the West Bank

and Gaza. It condemned all terrorist acts, executions without

trial, excessive use of force and the destruction of property.<p>But Negroponte said it was fundamentally flawed because it

did not even mention ``recent acts of terrorism'' against

Israelis or those responsible for them. On Dec. 1, Palestinian

suicide attacks killed 26 in Jerusalem and Haifa.<p>At least 776 Palestinians and 233 Israelis have been killed

since Israeli-Palestinian clashes flared anew in September of

last year after U.S. mediated peace efforts collapsed.

<p>The resolution sought to bolster Palestinian leader Yasser

Arafat days after Israel severed ties with him and branded him

''irrelevant'' in response to the spate of attacks on Israelis

this month. It said the Palestinian Authority remained ``the

indispensable and legitimate party for peace.''

<p>The break with Arafat on Thursday, a day after Palestinian

militants ambushed a bus in the West Bank and killed 10

Israelis, further evaporating hopes for a negotiated end to the

bloodshed. On Friday, the Israeli army killed eight

Palestinians.<p>Palestinian U.N. representative Nasser al-Kidwa said

cutting off Arafat threatened to plunge the region into war.<p>``This decision means the abandonment of the negotiation

process,'' al-Kidwa said, adding he feared Israel wanted to roll

back on autonomy and security agreements made during the Oslo

negotiation process that began in 1993.<p>Addressing the United States, he asked ``whether this

council is being used by some only when it's useful to them.''<p>A number of speakers admonished Israel for using excessive

force against Palestinians.<p>But Israel said it believed the conflict was not about

occupation but about the Jewish state's right to exist.<p>Israeli delegate Aaron Jacob said there was an

''ever-diminishing window of opportunity'' to salvage peace

negotiations if Palestinians entered direct bilateral talks

with Israel and crushed militant groups like Hamas.<p>``The terrorism that has afflicted Israeli civilians is part

and parcel of the fundamentalist terrorism that is now the

focus of a comprehensive international campaign aimed at its

eradication,'' Jacob said.<p>Britain said it abstained because the text did not reflect

the realities on ground, did not specify a next step for a

resumption of meaningful negotiations nor define responsibility

which both sides must accept to end violence.<p>``We urge Israel and the Palestinian Authority to pull back

from the brink and work together to end violence,'' British

Ambassador Sir Jeremy Greenstock said. ``It serves no one's

interest to undermine President Arafat or to weaken the

Palestinian Authority.''
