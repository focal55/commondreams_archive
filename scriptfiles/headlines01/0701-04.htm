SALZBURG, Austria (AP) -- Helicopters circled overhead and

busloads of riot police suited up in black, full-body armor Sunday

as Europe's top economic and political leaders converged on

Salzburg for a summit expected to draw anti-globalization protests.<p>

   Hundreds of protesters, meanwhile, gathered at the local

communist party headquarters before pulling hoods over their heads

and marching on the main train station where they planned a rally

coinciding with the European Economic Summit's opening Sunday

afternoon.<p>

</table></font>Carrying communist hammer-and-sickle flags, they chanted, ''Our

world is not for sale, put the bankers into jail!''<p>

   Police had earlier sealed off the convention hall itself with

rings of barriers that turned this medieval alpine tourist city

into a fortified maze of checkpoints.<p>

   The extra precautions come after street fighting left 70 people

injured last month at the European Union summit in Goteborg,

Sweden, and similar riots injured 32 people at an anti-World Bank

rally last weekend in Barcelona, Spain.<p>

   Local press reports estimated nearly 5,000 police were on duty

to make sure mayhem doesn't erupt in Salzburg, the hometown of

Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.<p>

   The event, hosted by the World Economic Forum and chaired by

billionaire financier George Soros, runs through Tuesday.<p>

   Salzburg Mayor Heinz Schaden, speaking to Austrian television

ORF, defended the bulked-up security saying his city's tourist

industry could not afford to be scarred by scenes of looting,

street fighting and stone throwing.<p>

   Kelli Smith, a 24-year-old tourist from San Diego, Calif., and a

travel companion were scared off even before the protests began.<p>

   ''We came down from Munich 24 hours ago and we're getting out of

here,'' Smith said. ''I've never seen so many police.''<p>

   Protest organizers complained Saturday that authorities were

exaggerating the threat of violence, and the streets were quiet

overnight. By midday Sunday, police had made no arrests, police

spokeswoman Sonja Fiegel said.<p>

   The European Economic Summit brings together the region's

political and business leaders to discuss such topics as EU

enlargement and Russia's relationship with the rest of Europe.<p>

   More than 600 participants from 44 countries were to take part

in the meeting, including 15 heads of state or prime ministers.
