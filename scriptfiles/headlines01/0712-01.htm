WASHINGTON  - The United States has told Russia

and its allies that it expects its development of a missile

defense will conflict with a Cold War-era treaty in months, not

years, documents obtained by Reuters showed.

<p>At the Pentagon, an official said on Wednesday that U.S.

defense officials would outline a missile defense plan on

Thursday that would propose breaking ground at a test site in

Alaska next month.

<p>Washington has told Russia that it plans to violate the

1972 Anti-ballistic Missile Treaty, according to the documents,

which were sent out as guidance to U.S. embassies a week ago.

<p>Moscow has viewed the treaty as the cornerstone of

strategic arms control although Russian leaders have said

recently it would consider amending the pact.

<p>The papers said the United States had told its allies and

Russia that it would seek capabilities prohibited under the

pact, including sea-based and other mobile methods -- such as

an airborne laser -- to shoot down long-range missiles in an

action often compared to chasing a bullet with a bullet.

<p>The documents were the most explicit public sign yet of

what a senior State Department official said Washington had

told Russia and its allies months ago -- that the Bush

administration expected to depart from ABM sooner rather than

later.

<p>The 24-page document said that Washington had told Russia

and its allies that ``while we do not know precisely when our

programs will come into conflict with the ABM treaty in the

future, the timing is likely to be measured in months, not

years.''

<p>``We will pursue all promising technologies and basing

modes, including those prohibited under the treaty,'' the papers

said.

<p>State Department spokesman Richard Boucher broadly

confirmed the authenticity of the documents, saying that

embassies had been sent points to use to support missile

defense.

<p>The documents said that a test system for fiscal year 2002,

which begins on Oct. 1, marked a first step in reviewing the

approach of the Clinton administration, whose policy was to

amend rather than scrap the 29-year-old treaty.

<p>REFLECT THE GOALS OF THE NEW ADMINISTRATION

<p>``The test program will be modified and built upon to

reflect the goals and guidance of the new administration,'' the

document said. The next test is due Saturday.

<p>Bush's proposed 2002 defense budget submitted to Congress

on June 27 seeks $8.3 billion for missile defense, nearly 50

percent more than in the current budget.

<p>Bush argues that with the end of the Cold War, U.S.-Russian

relations should no longer be based on ``Mutual Assured

Destruction,'' and that the key new danger is now from ``rogue

states'' like North Korea, Iran and Iraq.

<p>Some European allies have expressed concern about the risk

that such a system could spur others to build more weapons,

essentially fueling an arms race.

<p>The documents said an interim ground-based system could be

deployed as soon as 2004 in Alaska, which would violate the ABM

treaty as it envisaged interceptor missiles shielding only two

sites -- a major city and the nuclear arsenal itself.

<p>Test assets could be adapted ``as soon as possible to

provide an interim capability against near-term threats.''

<p>In a clear reference to the threat from North Korea, which

according to CIA estimates could have tested missiles capable

of striking U.S. cities by 2005, the documents said an interim

system offered more protection against longer-range missiles

than it had now -- which was none.

<p>The Bush administration said Tuesday it was planning to

expand its test program to possible sites at Fort Greely and

Kodiak Island in Alaska as part of what Rear Admiral Craig

Quigley, a Defense Department spokesman, called a vast Pacific

''test bed'' to allow for more realistic intercept tests.

<p>Now the only integrated tests of interceptors designed to

shoot down long-range missiles are launched from a range in the

Kwajalein Atoll of the Republic of the Marshall Islands.

<p>In the three flight tests so far, interceptors have

succeeded only once in smashing a dummy fired from Vandenberg

Air Force Base in California.
