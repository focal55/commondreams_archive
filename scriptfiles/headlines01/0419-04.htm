BOGOT&Aacute; -- "The Chainsaw Massacre is not a film in Colombia," said

government ombudsman Eduardo Cifuentes, referring to the April 12

paramilitary massacre in Alto Naya, 650 kilometers (404 miles)

southeast of here.



<p>

He was revealing details of the massacres of civilians which occurred

during Easter week in this overwhelmingly Roman Catholic country in a

wave of right-wing paramilitary and leftist guerrilla violence.



<p>

It left some 128 people dead, including 40 in Alto Naya, according to

official reports quoted by Cifuentes in an interview with AFP.



<p>

The former Constitutional Tribunal president visited the massacre

sites Monday at a remote jungle area in the Western Andes mountains,

in the Cauca department.



<p>

Around 400 paramilitaries took part in this "caravan of death" against

civilians accused of supporting leftist guerrillas, Cifuentes said in

his Bogota office.



<p>

"The remains of a woman were exhumed. Her abdomen was cut open with a

chainsaw. A 17-year-old girl had her throat cut and both hands also

amputated," said the ombudsman, providing details of "the cruelty and

extreme abuse of the paramilitaries."



<p>

"They carried a list of names around. The would kill many for

insignificant reasons, like not explaining where they got their

cellular phone," he said.



<p>

"A neighbor pounced upon a paramilitary that was ready to shoot him

and took his weapon, but unfortunately he didn't know how to fire a

rifle. They dragged him away, cut him open with a chainsaw and chopped

him up," a witness of the massacre told El Espectador daily.



<p>

In all the massacres, "some by the guerrillas, some by the

paramilitaries, the civilian population are the victims," said

Cifuentes, adding that he has already come under a "death threat."



<p>

He said there were "4,000 people unable to leave the Alto Naya area

since the massacre," and that authorities have been asked to set up a

"military airlift" to feed them.



<p>

"Nobody, paramilitary or guerrillas, respects international human

rights," said Cifuentes before providing details of a recent attack on

Almaguer, also in Cauca department, by the leftist Revolutionary Armed

Forces of Colombia (FARC), the country's largest rebel group.



<p>

The FARC "blew up the church and destroyed three neighborhoods with

tractors and pipe bombs."



<p>

Around 400 FARC guerrillas killed at least 28 civilians and destroyed

20 stores Sunday in Taraza (450 kilometers -- 280 miles -- northeast of

here), whose inhabitants were also charged with helping "the enemy,"

meaning the extreme right-wing United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia

(AUC).



<p>

Cifuentes has yet to visit that massacre site.



<p>

Some 200,000 people have been killed since 1964 in Colombia's civil war.



<p>

Kidnappings average 3,000 a year and the violence continues unabated

despite ongoing peace talks between President Andres Pastrana's

government and the FARC and the National Liberation Army, the

country's second-largest leftist rebel group.



<p>

The ELN took 27 employees hostage from US-owned Occidental Petroleum

near the Cano Limon oil fields, 500 kilometers (310 miles) northeast

of here.
