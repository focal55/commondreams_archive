LONDON   - British journalist Robert Fisk was

attacked and badly beaten on Saturday by a mob in Pakistan.

<p>Fisk, 55, a veteran foreign correspondent for the London

based Independent newspaper, was set upon by a group of around

100 Afghan refugees after his car broke down on the road

between the Pakistani border towns of Quetta and Chaman.

<p>``It was a very frightening experience and I am in a lot of

pain but I am glad to be alive,'' he told a colleague on the

Independent. ``I'm going to bear the scars for the rest of my

life. Sadly I broke down in the wrong place at the wrong time.''

<p>The colleague told Reuters: ``He was passing through a

village full of refugees who'd just escaped from Kandahar.

Robert told me he discovered later that they'd been bombed.

<p>``He said that the sight of two westerners pushing a broken

down car attracted a crowd. They were friendly at first but

then a child threw a stone which hit him on the head and then

the others joined in.''

<p>Fisk suffered injuries to his head, face and hands after

being pelted by stones. A spokeswoman for the Independent said

Fisk was recovering at his hotel in Quetta.

<p>``Robert says he completely understands why this happened,''

she told Reuters. ``These people were refugees. They've lost

everything. Robert says he understands why they're angry. He

doesn't hold it against them at all.''

<p>Asked whether Fisk, widely acknowledged to be an expert on

the Middle East, would continue to report on the conflict in

Afghanistan  the spokeswoman said: ``We're expecting Robert to be

writing for the Independent on Monday.''
