BEIJING   -- Chinese reacted with outrage Monday to the

collision of a U.S. Navy plane and a Chinese fighter jet, and some

demanded that authorities seize the American plane or imprison its

24 crew members.

<p>

   In interviews on the street and in comments posted online,

Chinese urged their government to resist what they see as U.S.

bullying. The EP-3 surveillance plane is being held at an island

air base in the South China Sea as U.S. diplomats try to gain its

release.<p>

</table>Few Chinese seemed to doubt the official explanation blaming the

American plane. Some said the government should use the aircraft

and its crew to extract U.S. concessions. Others said the plane

should be dissected to learn its high-tech secrets.<p>

   ''America is too despotic,'' said one young man with

shoulder-length hair wearing fashionable khakis and a bright

windbreaker. ''China needs to take a hard line on this.''<p>

   ''We can't not take action. If they want to fight a war, we'll

give them a war,'' said another young man walking to work in a

Western-style business suit.<p>

   Both men declined to give their names.<p>

   Most young Chinese are nationalistic and, despite a fondness for

American pop culture, see the United States as an obstacle on

China's path to superpower status.<p>

   Official media cheered Chinese basketball star Wang Zhizhi's

departure last week to play in the United States. But other reports

denounced possible U.S. arms sales to Taiwan, the island democracy

that China considers its territory.<p>

   Although the government seemed to be weighing its options

Monday, some said the strong public reaction could push it to take

a harder line.<p>

   Many recalled the NATO bombing of China's embassy in Yugoslavia

two years ago. That sparked mass anti-U.S. protests in cities

across China. Most Chinese refused to accept Washington's

explanation that the bombing was unintended.<p>

   In Hong Kong, demonstrators organized by a pro-Beijing labor

group gathered outside the U.S. consulate in a loud but peaceful

protest blaming the United States for the collision.<p>

   About 100 people shouted that the United States had ''invaded

our country's air space and knocked down our fighter jet,'' and

they accused the Americans of being too cowardly to face up to it.

<p>

   Web surfers left messages on the People's Daily's ''Strong

Country'' <a href="http://202.99.23.237/cgi-bbs/ChangeBrd?to=15&page=1&query_var=0&match=0&query_val=">chat site</a> urging the government to keep the plane as a

bargaining chip. One writer, using the pseudonym ''Love or Not

Love,'' said the plane's crew should be put in a prisoner-of-war

camp.

<p>

   ''If the Chinese government shows weakness again in handling the

collision, it will arouse strong dissatisfaction among Chinese

people,'' said one posting, signed ''Trouble Maker.''<p>

   Others called for caution.<p>

   One warned against protests like 1999, saying those ultimately

hurt China. A more ''mature response'' would protect China's

interests and win greater benefits, said the writer, who used the

pen name ''Pigtail.''<p>

   Public anger may have been even more extreme because state media

haven't reported U.S. offers to help search for the Chinese pilot

who Beijing says crashed in the sea.<p>

   One posting signed ''zrf197962'' on the popular sina.com

chat-room expressed admiration for the missing pilot, saying he

stood up to American ''hegemony.''
