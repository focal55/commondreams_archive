Whales eat more fish than humans do and full-scale

hunting should resume to protect stocks, Japan claimed yesterday.

<p>

The assertion will create controversy at next month's meeting of the

International Whaling Commission in London, where Japan hopes to use the

results from its limited "scientific" whaling programme to convince fishing

nations to vote for full-scale resumption.

biologist and Edinburgh-based member of the IWC scientific committee.

<p>

He said it was an open question whether whales damaged fisheries.

<p>

Joji Morishita, of the Japanese government's fisheries agency and a delegate to

the IWC, says that the results - to be revealed today by <i>New Scientist</i>

magazine - come from last autumn's scientific slaughter of whales in the

north-west Pacific.

<p>

As well as minke whales, the catch included Bryde's and sperm whales for the

first time. 

<p>

Japanese anchovy made up more than 70% of the stomach contents of the 43

Bryde's whales killed during the seven-week hunt. Anchovy, walleye pollock and

Pacific saury made up 90% of the diet of the 40 minke whales taken.

<p>

"These are all important fisheries for Japan," Mr Morishita said. "Anti-whalers

say they only eat krill and squid, but we can show otherwise."

<p>

But Mr Leaper says: "Even if they are eating fish, it doesn't mean there is

direct competition. In all the studies of predator-prey interactions, fish are

always the major predators of fish. For example, in the North Sea adult cod are

the major predators of juvenile cod. I think the Japanese have not done the

science before making these claims. Scientists around the world are studying

these marine ecosystem interactions and they are proving hugely complex to

understand.

<p>

"No one has yet come up with answers. The Japanese are jumping the gun, but it

is something the IWC scientific committee will want to look at."

<p>

Japanese fish catches have halved since the IWC imposed an international

moratorium on commercial whaling 16 years ago, says Mr Morishita. "We don't say

whales are the only reason for depressed fish stocks, but they are major

components of the marine ecosystem. We think there may be some connection."

<p>

Japan has abided by the IWC's moratorium on commercial whaling, while taking a

limited catch for "scientific research". Critics say they are exploiting a

loophole in IWC rules.

<p>

Japan's Institute of Cetacean Research last year estimated that whales could be

eating between three and five times the amount caught by the world's fishing

fleets.
