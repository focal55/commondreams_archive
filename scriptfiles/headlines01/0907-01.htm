BOGOTA, Colombia   - President Andres Pastrana, one of

Washington's closest allies in the global war on drugs, called

Thursday for a review of that struggle, saying it has produced few

victories.

<p>

	   ``The conclusions are not good,'' Pastrana said in a rare talk

with foreign journalists ahead of next week's visit by Secretary of

State Colin Powell. ``The conclusions are that drugs are still the

first- or second-biggest business of mankind.''

</font>n the wide-ranging discussion in the presidential palace,

Pastrana said he still hopes for a negotiated end to Colombia's

civil war. He also said the United States should re-establish

intelligence-sharing with Colombia's air force about suspected drug

flights, and urged President Bush  to help organize an international

narcotics conference.

<p>

	   ``Clearly, we must also make an evaluation - and not only of the

policies of fumigation and interdiction,'' Pastrana said.

<p>

	   He described a global narcotics industry worth $500 billion and

said drug lords are seeking out new markets in Europe and the

former Soviet Union.

<p>

	   Drug use is on the rise in the United States, Pastrana said.

However, the White House says the overall number of drug users has

dropped, but that heroin use is rising and more Americans aged

18-25 are using drugs.

<p>

	   Washington suspended helping Colombia and Peru track down

drug-smuggling flights - using U.S. radar and surveillance planes -

after the accidental shootdown of a U.S. missionary plane over the

Peruvian Amazon in April.

<p>

	   Pastrana said the suspension ``has allowed a lot of drugs to

pass over our territory because there is no control of our air

space.''

<p>

	   He urged a resumption, saying: ``I think we can truly hit the

heart of the business through interdiction, and not simply through

fumigation.''

<p>

	   The fumigation of drug plants by U.S.-provided crop-dusters is

the linchpin of Washington's $1.3 billion counternarcotics policy

in Colombia. The spraying has been criticized amid allegations it

endangers health and the environment, and that it hurts peasant

farmers who grow coca to eke out a living.

<p>

	   The president gave no indication that he would backtrack on the

spraying during his last year in office, but said he wanted to

focus on large-scale coca plantations.

<p>

	   The rebel Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, and

their enemies, the right-wing paramilitary United Self-Defense

Forces of Colombia, earn huge profits by guarding and taxing the

coca and poppy plantations that provide much of the world's

cocaine, and most of the heroin used in the United States.

<p>

	   The millions of dollars in drug revenue has allowed the FARC and

the paramilitaries to expand their forces and better arm

themselves.

<p>

	   Pastrana said the U.S. and Europe should stem the laundering of

drug money and control the export of chemicals used in Colombia to

process cocaine.

<p>

	   Despite the glacially slow pace of peace talks begun with the

FARC three years ago, Pastrana said he would leave office

satisfied.

<p>

	   ``I tell you, Andres Pastrana was elected for one purpose: to

try, by all legal and constitutional means, to consolidate a peace

process,'' he told reporters. ``And for the first time, we today

are sitting at the table even with all the difficulties.''

<p>

	   Pastrana said he has not decided yet whether to renew rebel

control over a huge southern safe haven he granted the FARC three

years ago. The safe zone, which the FARC allegedly is using to

stash kidnap victims and stage military attacks, expires next

month.

<p>

	   ``The government has given everything. We hope the FARC

reciprocates,'' Pastrana said.

<p>

	   Pastrana said he plans to discuss trade issues with Powell

during his visit to Bogota on Tuesday and Wednesday. Colombia wants

a renewal and broadening of the U.S. Andean Trade Preference Act,

which expires in December, Pastrana said.

<p>

	   The ATPA aims to develop legal alternatives to drug production

in Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru by giving duty-free status

to the Andean region's exports, such as flowers, minerals, coffee

and bananas.

<p>

	   Colombia wants to add textiles, food oils and other products.

<p>

	   ``We've said to the Americans: don't give us dollars. We don't

want money,'' Pastrana said. ``Give us trade. Give us the chance to

compete.''
