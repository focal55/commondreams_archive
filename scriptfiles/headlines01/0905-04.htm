DURBAN, South Africa  - Africa was headed for a

showdown Wednesday with its former masters over demands that

states that profited from the slave trade and colonialism

apologize and pay reparations for the damage done.

<p>The European Union and Africa remain far apart in their

talks on the issue at a U.N.-sponsored conference on racism,

with the Europeans offering increased cash for aid but

rejecting the notion of reparations.

</table></font>African delegates maintain that the affluence enjoyed by

many in the developed world today was built on the backs of

slave labor and the raw materials extracted from the world's

poorest continent.

<p>``The slave trade destroyed Africa's human resources ... and

the lack of those human resources weakened the continent,'' said

one central African delegate who declined to be named.

<p>``In the 16th century there was not such a great difference

between Europe and Africa...today there is because of the

legacies of colonialism and slavery which helped to build the

West's economies. This generation in the West has benefited

from those crimes and should pay for them,'' he said.

<p>Millions of Africans were uprooted from their homes and

shipped chained in appalling conditions across the Atlantic to

plantations in the New World. Countless perished en route.

<p>Colonialism also took a huge toll on the continent, with

millions of enforced laborers dying in the Belgian Congo where

authorities terrorized locals into collecting rubber by cutting

off hands and committing other atrocities.

<p>Africa today remains the world's poorest continent,

burdened by poverty, disease and brutal conflicts.

<p>AFRICANS SAY UNITED ON REPARATIONS

<p>``The African group holds a common position (on reparations

and apologies),'' said South Africa's Public Service and

Administration Minister Geraldine Fraser-Moleketi, who is

leading Pretoria's delegation on talks with other African

nations on the issue.

<p>She denied reports that there had been a ``hardening'' of

Africa's stance on the issue, but delegates who have seen the

documents under discussion have disputed this.

<p>``The latest document from the Africans is less flexible,''

said Marcos Pinta Gama, a spokesman for the Brazilian delegation, which is trying to broker a compromise.

<p>Genocide against indigenous peoples and apartheid are also

under discussion, with the Africans pushing to have them and

slavery branded as crimes against humanity.

<p>The Ecumenical Caucus, an umbrella group of churches,

backed the African demands, asking ``for our churches and

governments to acknowledge that they have benefited from the

exploitation of Africans and African descendants.''

<p>REPARATIONS ALSO MAJOR ISSUE IN U.S.

<p>Across the Atlantic, the issue of reparations is also

becoming a major issue with the descendants of the slaves taken

from Africa demanding compensation for an injustice which many

commentators say is still inflicting harm on blacks in America.

<p>``It is the issue of repair for damage done,'' United States

civil rights leader Jesse Jackson told Reuters on the sidelines

of the conference.

<p>``We (African-Americans) have fewer services and less

education. We are disproportionately jailed and killed by the

state. We have shorter life spans. We have less access to

capital,'' Jackson said.

<p>He added that all of these social and economic problems

faced by the African-American community were rooted in the

centuries of slavery that ended with the North's victory over

the South in the Civil War in 1865.

<p>Asked if he would make reparations for slavery a political

priority when he returns to the United States, Jackson said:

''Yes, of course...we must make crooked ways straight.''
