CAMBRIDGE, MASS - Taking a more punitive line than officials elsewhere in the university, Harvard Law School has reprimanded four students who were involved in this spring's 21-day sit-in over minimum wages for Harvard employees.

<P>

<P>The reprimands will be listed on their transcripts, and the students will have to explain both their actions and the punishment whenever they apply to a state bar to practice law.

</table></font></font>The students and one of their lawyers complained yesterday that the law school had trampled their due-process rights. They also said they feared that the sanctions may hurt the students' careers. And they said that the action smacked of retribution, noting that Harvard College gave only probation to about 25 undergraduates who took part in the three-week occupations of Massachusetts Hall.

<P>

<P>''This punishment is off the charts for Harvard,'' said John D. Fitzpatrick, a Boston lawyer who, with Harvard Law professor Lani Guinier, represented the four students at a disciplinary hearing Friday.

<P>

<P>''When the sit-in was resolved, there was a tacit understanding that, at the very least, the students should only be given a very <i>pro forma </i>punishment, if any,'' he added. ''Everyone was on the same page except the law school.''

<P>

<P>Joe Wrinn, a university spokesman, said yesterday that individual Harvard schools had discretion on punishment of their students. 

<P>

<P>Besides those at the law school and Harvard College, students from the John F. Kennedy School of Government also faced discipline after the sit-in, but they escaped punishment.

<P>

<P>The four law students were charged with violating the school's code of ''rights and responsibilities,'' chiefly, according to those at Friday's hearing, for disrupting and sometimes paralyzing business inside Massachusetts Hall, where Harvard's president and senior officers work.

<P>

<P>The charges were similar to those faced by the Harvard College students. The relevant portions of the law school's code and the college's Handbook for Students are similar. Both policies say that students may not interfere or obstruct the business of the university.

<P>

<P>''Harvard College might have had a different interpretation of the protest and their rules than the law school had,'' said Michael Armini, a spokesman for the law school.

<P>

<P>Richard D. Parker and John Mansfield, two of the Law school professors involved in Friday's hearing, which ran for six hours, did not return phone calls and e-mail seeking comment yesterday.

<P>

<P>One of the four law students - Aaron Bartley, who is graduating this week - said he believed that the hearing process was deeply flawed.

<P>

<P>According to Bartley, Fitzpatrick, and others at the hearing, no evidence was introduced tying misconduct to the four law students, except to establish that they took part in the sit-in. 

<P>

<P>One story was told of how one of the 30 or so protesters allegedly tripped a Massachusetts Hall employee; another story dealt with how the protesters' chant of ''shame on you,'' directed at the Harvard provost, Harvey Fineberg, had been interpreted as criticism of staff members walking with Fineberg.

<P>

<P>''The whole thing was broad and very vague,'' Bartley said. ''For an institution like Harvard Law School to feel the need to publicly and thoroughly punish students based on a witch hunt, beyond what could have been just a warning, was inappropriate.''

<P>

<P>But at least one person on the eight-member law school panel had pressed to suspend the four students, according to people familiar with the deliberations.

<P>

<P>The law school's disciplinary proceeding was the last against the Massachusetts Hall protesters. 

<P>

<P>The college, in a private hearing last month, decided to place the undergraduate protesters on disciplinary probation until the end of the current semester.

<P>

<P>The sanction, tantamount to a written warning rather than a disciplinary action, stays on their transcripts; if they apply to graduate school or for a government job that requires college records, the punishment will be evident.
