CARACAS, Venezuela  - The United States said on

Tuesday it was ``surprised and deeply disappointed'' by comments

from Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez condemning civilian

casualties caused by the U.S. bombing of Afghanistan.

<p>In statements released by the State Department in

Washington and its embassy in Caracas, the U.S. government

rebutted Chavez's suggestion that military operations to

destroy Osama bin Laden's al Qaeda network were like fighting

''terror with more terror.''

<p>``We reject this representation of the coalition's actions

in Afghanistan,'' read the embassy statement. ``It is false to

present the U.S. response to the al Qaeda attack as if it were

an act of terrorism.''

<p>It was the clearest sign to date of Washington's growing

irritation with Venezuelan criticisms of its diplomatic and

military response to the Sept. 11 suicide attacks in New York

and Washington, which killed some 4,800 people.

<p>It came less than a week after the U.S. ambassador to

Caracas, Donna Hrinak, said Venezuela's international

credibility had been damaged by ``contradictory'' statements from

some senior government officials.

<p>Venezuela is second largest oil supplier to the United

States, but traditionally close ties with Washington have

become more strained since Chavez took office in 1999.

<p>Citing the need for a ``multipolar'' world order, Chavez has

strengthened ties with China and Russia, and with states such

as Iraq, Libya, Iran and Cuba, which are on a U.S. list of

sponsors of terrorism.

<p>AFGHAN CIVILIAN NOT THE TARGET

<p>In his televised speech late on Monday, former paratrooper

Chavez condemned the Sept. 11 suicide attacks but made an

impassioned plea for an end to ``the killing of innocents'' in

Afghanistan.

<p>``We were surprised and deeply disappointed by President

Chavez's comments which are not in accord with Venezuela's

position in the United Nations,'' said the State Department

comment, read to Reuters by a U.S. diplomat in Caracas.

<p>The U.S. government has admitted that civilians have been

killed by stray bombs and missiles in its daily air strikes

against Afghanistan's Taliban rulers. It blames the Taliban for

hiding Saudi-born militant bin Laden, whom it holds responsible

for the Sept. 11 attacks.

<p>Chavez said on Monday there could be ``no justification of

any kind'' for civilian casualties, even those killed by

mistake.

<p>In response, the State Department said: ``We are not

targeting the people of Afghanistan and have made every effort

to avoid any civilian casualties. We deeply regret any such

casualties.''

<p>It said the military response against Afghanistan was an

act of self-defense in accordance with article 51 of the U.N.

charter, and noted that four Venezuelans had been among those

killed in the suicide hijackings.

<p>``The attacks of Sept. 11 were attacks against the entire

global community, citizens from over 80 countries lost their

lives,'' the statement read.

<p>The latest spat came on the eve of a meeting between

Ambassador Hrinak and Foreign Minister Luis Davila to ``clarify''

her comments on Venezuela's international credibility.
