WASHINGTON  - U.S. Air Force warplanes damaged a

mosque in eastern Afghanistan  as the Muslim holy month of

Ramadan began on Friday when a malfunctioning bomb missed its

target, the U.S. military said.

<p>The errant 500-pound bomb was one of three dropped on a

building complex in Khowst, close to the eastern border with

Pakistan, said the Tampa, Florida-based Central Command, which

is coordinating the U.S. campaign.

<p>Two of the bombs struck a ``known facility'' of al Qaeda, the

guerrilla network of Osama bin Laden, suspected mastermind of

the Sept. 11 attacks on the United States, a statement said.

<p>``The third bomb suffered a guidance malfunction and missed

the facility,'' it said. ``The resulting explosion damaged a

mosque.''

<p>Friday marked the advent of Ramadan in Afghanistan, a time

that mosques were likely to be crowded.

<p>The Central Command said it did not immediately know the

amount of damage caused by the bombing, which it said took

place about 10 a.m. EST Friday -- early evening in Afghanistan.

<p>``We are unaware of any injuries as a result of the errant

bomb,'' it added.
