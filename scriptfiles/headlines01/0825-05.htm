The <a href="http://www.centerforculturalexchange.org/" target="_new">Center 

for Cultural Exchange</a>, known for sponsoring hundreds of multicultural 

performances, is renting its facilities in Portland to <a href="http://www.nike.com/" target="_new">Nike Inc</a>., a 

footwear and apparel company known for its exploitation of workers in 

sweatshops across the globe, for the corporation's annual shareholders' 

meeting on Sept. 17. 

        

<p> The center's decision to do business 

with the Oregon-based Nike has sparked threats of demonstrations from 

several groups concerned about the company's record of exploiting Third-World 

workers.</p>

<p> The center is a nonprofit organization 

dedicated to promoting cultural awareness by presenting performances 

of music and dance from a wide range of ethnic and refugee populations. 

It also rents its facilities in Longfellow Square to outside groups 

for meetings and events. </p>

<p> Beverly Dacey, the center's finance 

director, denied the organization had made a deal with Nike, insisting 

no contract had been signed. But Ken Kunin, the president of the center's 

board of directors, confirmed that co-director Phyllis O'Neill had committed 

the function hall for the stockholders' meeting. </p>

<p>&quot;This is certainly not a [center] 

sponsored event,&quot; Kunin said. &quot;It's a private rental of a space that 

the center maintains.</p>

<p>&quot;Maybe after this meeting takes 

place, it would make sense for the center to take a look at its policies 

on private rentals,&quot; he added.</p>

<p> Both O'Neill and co-director Bau 

Graves were unavailable for comment. </p>

<p> According to Nike public relations 

representative Leslye Mundy, the company is holding the meeting in Maine 

because of its ownership of Yarmouth-based Cole Haan shoe company. </p>

<p>&quot;We're a global business with global 

shareholders,&quot; Mundy said. </p>

<p> Local labor and human rights activists 

are already planning to demonstrate outside the center during the meeting 

to protest Nike's factory conditions. </p>

<p>&quot;Nike is one of the biggest users 

of Third-World-country sweatshops,&quot; said Jack Bussell, an activist associated 

with Mainers Against Globalization. &quot;I'm sure we'll want to protest 

[the meeting]. The center should not be holding a function like this. 

They should be aware of what's going on in the world.&quot;</p>

<p> Michael Boyson, a member of the 

center's board, also holds stock in Nike, and plans to attend the shareholders' 

meeting. Boyson said he was not involved in the negotiation between 

the center and Nike.</p>

<p>&quot;I don't have a problem with Nike 

meeting at the center,&quot; he said. &quot;I have confidence in [the center's] 

staff, and I have confidence in Nike. I know a great deal about the 

company, and as an individual citizen, I'm all for [the Nike meeting].</p>

<p> According to Nike's 2001 annual 

report, virtually all of the company's footwear is produced outside 

the United States, the majority in China (40 percent), with significant 

amounts in Indonesia (31 percent), Vietnam (13 percent) and Thailand 

(13 percent). In fiscal year 2001, about 5 percent of Nike apparel was 

manufactured in the U.S. and the remainder in 28 other countries, including 

Bangladesh, China, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia and Malaysia. </p>

<p>&quot;We believe that Nike would do 

well to operate in accordance with Maine values of common decency and 

basic fairness,&quot; said Bjorn Claesson, an organizer of the anti-sweatshop 

organization called the <a href="http://www.pica.ws/cc/index.html" target="_new">Maine Clean Clothes Campaign</a>, &quot;and hope that 

Nike's coming to Maine is a sign that Nike will indeed live up to its 

commitments to improve conditions for workers that make Nike products,&quot;</p>

<p> Mundy said the company had &quot;made 

a lot of progress over the past three years with improving working conditions 

internationally.&quot; In 1998, Nike CEO Philip Knight promised to bring 

&quot;a sea of change&quot; to the company culture.</p>

<p>&quot;We were heartened by his statements,&quot; 

Claesson said in written remarks. &quot;Unfortunately, a recent comprehensive 

examination of Nike labor practices by the human rights organization 

<a href="http://www.globalexchange.org/" target="_new">Global Exchange</a> during the three years since Mr. Knight made his promises, 

reveals that Nike still has far to go.&quot;</p>

<p> According to a May 2001 report 

from Global Exchange, &quot;The projects Knight announced have been of little 

benefit to Nike workers. Nike workers are still forced to work excessive 

hours in high pressure work environments, are not paid enough to meet 

the most basic needs of their children, and are subject to harassment, 

dismissal, and violent intimidation if they try to form unions or tell 

journalists about labor abuses in their factories.&quot;</p>

<p> That record has inflamed activists' 

passions about the Nike meeting and the center's decision to rent to 

the company.</p>

<p>&quot;It seems to be kind of insensitive 

of [the center],&quot; said Scott Miller, director of <a href="http://www.peaceactionme.org/" target="_new">Peace Action Maine</a>. 

&quot;[Nike] creates misery for all the people they employ with abject wages 

and health hazards. The center is there to bring information from different 

cultures to broaden people's minds, where Nike [creates] very low standards 

of living across the world. They fracture cultures, and they have no 

place in the center.&quot;</p>

<p> Ned McCann, treasurer of <a href="http://www.mainepage.com/maineafl-cio/" target="_new">Maine 

AFL-CIO</a>, is &quot;offended that Nike will be in Maine,&quot; and he promised the 

labor organization's members would turn up for the protest outside the 

meeting. &quot;Some of us will be there,&quot; he said, &quot;and we'll be making some 

noise.&quot; </p>

<p> David Ray, a former member of the 

center's board and the organization's current lawyer, defended the rental 

agreement, saying it was a simple business decision. &quot;Some of the things 

the center does aren't intended to follow its mission,&quot; Ray said. &quot;One 

part of the center is maintaining the rental facility, and the other 

is to promote our mission.&quot;
