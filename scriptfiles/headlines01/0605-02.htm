UNITED NATIONS  - The United Nations Centre for Human

Settlements (Habitat) launched its first reports on urban

conditions and trends Monday, stressing that more than 1.2 billion

of the world's population of 6 billion live in inadequate housing.

<P>

"For the first time, the city, rather than the country, is used as

the basic unit of analysis," said Secretary General Kofi Annan

during the reports' release.

</table>The 126-page 'State of the World's Cities Report 2001' and its 344-

page sister publication 'Cities in a Globalizing World: Report on

Human Settlements 2001' depart from a longstanding tradition of

country-level analysis and instead monitor the realities faced by

urban populations.  

<P>

Pointing out that "the world's urban areas are now home to more

than half of humankind - 3 billion people," Annan stressed that

"sustainable urban development is one of the most pressing

challenges facing the human community in the 21st century."  

<P>

Anna Kajumulo Tibaijuka, Habitat's executive director, said,

"Homeless people are living in cardboard boxes on sidewalks of

gleaming corporate skyscrapers, whose budgets exceed those of many

countries." 

<P>

The central challenge faced by the global community is how to make

both globalisation and urbanisation work for all the world's

people, instead of benefitting only a few, added Jay Moore, a

principal contributor to the State of World Cities report.  

<P>

Moore added that liberalised trade and finance, without proper

safeguards, have made urban populations everywhere more vulnerable

to external shocks. He highlighted the suffering of poor people in

Bangkok, Thailand as a result of the Asian financial crisis of

1997 and 1998.  

<P>

The Report on Human Settlements argues that technology-driven

options for growth and development - which spur globalisation -

have led to divided cities where the lines of stratification

between people, places and groups are becoming more magnified.  

<P>

Tibaijuka lamented, "We are back to where Charles Dickens was 150

years ago when he wrote 'A Tale of Two Cities'."  

<P>

Cities are hubs of dynamism, change and opportunity but also

places of exploitation, disease and unemployment, Annan said.  

<P>

The reports cite studies showing that while some groups have

improved their housing conditions, a disproportionate share of the

world's population - particularly in poor countries - has seen its

housing situation deteriorate.  

<P>

In Bangladesh, Nigeria, and Rwanda, for example, real incomes have

fallen, the cost of living has gone up, and the number of poor

households has grown, particularly in urban areas.  

<P>

Municipalities in highly industrialised countries obtain an

average of 2,906 dollars per capita in revenue per year. This

figure is almost 200 times the average revenue obtained by African

municipalities, which raise a meagre 14 dollars per capita per

year.  

<P>

According to Habitat, in Africa, only one-third of all urban

households are connected to potable water; in Asia and the

Pacific, a mere 38 percent of urban households are connected to a

sewerage system; in Europe, the processes of social exclusion

marginalise many low income and minority households; and in North

America, problems of residential segregation, discrimination in

housing markets and affordability persist, particularly in larger

cities, despite recent economic growth.  

<P>

The reports argue that traditional goals of urban planning and

development, aimed at supporting cities as engines of economic

growth, are too narrow.  

<P>

"Planners must begin to consider the feminisation as well as the

urbanisation of poverty," Tibaijuka said, emphasising that, "the

majority of the world's poor are women."  

<P>

Moore added, "We have not developed institutions well or fast

enough to govern or run our cities" even as urban centres have

grown to house half the world's population, up from two percent in

1800. 

<P>

"Policies must focus on capacity building, especially at the local

level and in civil society," Tibaijuka concluded.  

<P>

The Habitat reports were released to coincide with a review,

beginning here Wednesday, of progress since the Second World

Conference on Human Settlements was held in Istanbul in 1996.
