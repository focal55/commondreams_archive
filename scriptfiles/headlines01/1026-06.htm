WASHINGTON: The United

        Nations has sounded an alarm over the use of cluster

        bombs by American aircraft attacking Afghanistan, saying

        eight people died in a Herat village by dozens of

        unexploded orange-colored&quot;bomblets&quot; littering

        roads and fields.</font>

</table></font>Official said the

        cluster bomb dropped on the Herat village had left a

        village strewn with deadly unexploded

        &quot;bomblets.&quot; The official said eight people from

        the village had been killed in the American attack which

        leaves people trapped in their homes. UN staff has sought

        information from the US military about munitions dropped

        at the village of Shaker Qala, and other locations, said

        a UN spokesperson. &quot;Vehicles and pushcarts took an

        unconfirmed number of casualties ... to the main hospital

        in Heart,&quot; she said. Cluster bombs are dropped in a

        casing which splits open in mid-air, scattering up to 200

        bomblets the size of soft drink cans. They are used to

        destroy vehicles, to start fires and as an anti-personnel

        weapon. </font>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Sometimes they descend

        with mini-parachutes designed to prevent explosion on

        impact, so that they deny the enemy the use of an area

        such as an airfield. Shaker Qala lies near a military

        camp. &quot;The villagers have a lot to be afraid of,

        because these bomblets, if they did not explode, are very

        dangerous,&quot; Dan Kelly, manager of a UN mine removal

        program for Afghanistan, was quoted as saying by local

        media. &quot;They can explode if the villagers so much as

        touch them.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The United Nations

        report of the cluster bomb - a weapon used by American

        forces in every war since Vietnam that has frequently

        caused civilian deaths - was the latest of a growing

        number of accounts of American bombs going astray and

        causing civilian casualties. At the United Nations

        briefing where the incident involving the cluster bomb

        was disclosed, spokesmen said the Taliban had moved six

        tanks into another village outside Herat after an

        American bombing raid during the weekend. Afghans

        reaching Quetta said two villagers had died when five of

        the six tanks were struck in a subsequent American

        attack. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A UN official Dan Kelly

        was quoted as saying that Afghan employees of the

        program in Herat had gone to Shaker Qala, the village

        where the cluster bomb hit, to place sandbags around the

        bomblets and to clear paths that would allow villagers to

        leave their homes. Kelly said the description of the

        bomblets given over the radio from Herat suggested that

        the bomb appeared to have been of a type designed to

        scatter bomblets over an area of 20 football fields. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">He said that the

        bomblets, carried to the ground on small parachutes,

        contained a &quot;shaped charge&quot; capable of

        penetrating armored steel up to five inches thick. These

        bomblets, he said, are usually used for attacks on

        armored vehicles, troop concentrations, bunkers and

        other dispersed targets. </font></p>

</table></font>But they are deadly even

        if they fall to the ground unexploded, because their

        small size and bright color make them intriguing to

        passers-by, especially children. In more than 20 years of

        war, thousands of Afghan children have been killed or

        maimed by bomblets left over from Soviet bombing of

        guerrilla groups in the 1980's. </font>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Kelly appealed to the

        Pentagon to provide the United Nations with details of

        the payload, height and speed of the aircraft that

        dropped the cluster bomb. That would enable the

        mine-removal team to determine the &quot;footprint&quot;

        of the bomb and the area to search for the bomblets. With

        nearly 300 square miles of Afghanistan already taken up

        by uncleared minefields from the 22 years of Soviet

        military occupation and civil war, he said, &quot;the

        last thing Afghanistan needs right now is more unexploded

        mines and bombs.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Since the American raids

        began 18 days ago, bombing mistakes have been reported

        almost daily. In one early case, a targeting error caused

        a bomb to strike a United Nations mine-removal office in

        Kabul, killing four Afghan employees. No confirmation of

        the two Herat strikes, the one involving the cluster bomb

        and the one near the mosque, was immediately available

        from the Pentagon, which has acknowledged several

        accidental strikes on civilian targets. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Cluster bombs dropped by

        US warplanes on a village in western Afghanistan killed

        nine civilians and forced the survivors to abandon their

        homes, the United Nations said Thursday here in

        Islamabad. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">UN spokeswoman Stephanie

        Bunker told a press conference in Islamabad that eight

        people were killed straight away in Monday night's attack

        on the village near the city of Herat and a ninth was

        killed after picking up one of the bombs. Another 14

        people were injured, she said, and 20 of the 45 houses in

        the village were partially or completely destroyed.

        Bunker said local staff from the UN demining program

        had visited the village -- which she identified as Shaker

        Qala -- after the attack. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;They reported that

        eight civilians were killed directly in the attack and

        that one civilian was killed -- as happens in these cases

        -- when he went to look at the object, touched it and it

        blew up,&quot; she said. &quot;They have determined there

        were 45 homes in that village, 20 of the homes were

        partially or completely destroyed in the attack.

        &quot;The rest of the population decided to voluntarily

        evacuate and have gone into Herat.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Bunker said the

        survivors were only able to leave the village after the

        deminers made a path with sandbags for boundaries so the

        people fleeing did not touch any of the remaining bombs.

        The Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Fund said as well

        as the immediate deadly impact of the bombs, many of them

        did not explode on impact and could kill innocent

        civilians years later. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;There's already a

        framework of international humanitarian law that is very

        clearly defined,&quot; Hossain told reporters in

        Islamabad. &quot;Whoever is conducting those operations

        are under a legal obligation to comply.&quot; Hossain

        said international law stated maximum care must be taken

        to avoid civilian casualties and damage to

        non-combatants. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">He said the UN would

        monitor the US-led forces to ensure their actions

        complied with international law. But he would not be

        drawn on whether the dropping of cluster bombs on Shaker

        Qala or other US air strike blunders that have killed

        civilians during the 19-day military campaign had

        breached international law. </font></p>

<p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

According to earlier UN

        reports, a hospital and mosque in a military compound

        within one kilometer (mile) of Shaker Qala were also hit

        in the same series of raids. Bunker said Thursday the UN

        still stood by its reports, despite the United States

        refusing to acknowledge that the village, hospital or

        mosque had been hit. She said there were

        &quot;casualties&quot; from the attacks on the hospital

        and mosque, but was unable to give any more details

.
