ROME -- The family and friends of anti-G8 protester Carlo Giuliani took to the streets of Genoa Monday, in a peaceful commemoration of his death a month to the day after he was shot by a police officer, authorities said.

</font>Giuliani's father, a unionist, his mother and sister as well as supporters of the anti-globalization cause rallied in the square where the 23-year-old was shot during rioting as world leaders met in the port city for a Group of Eight (G8) summit.

<p>A few passers-by expressed their sympathy.</p>

<p>At the request of the protester's father, Giuliano Giuliani, there was no official commemoration of Carlo's death in Genoa's Alimonda square, nor were banners or flags displayed.</p>

<p>"There will be no statements today. I've already talked too much," said Giuliani. "I want this to be a day of meditation."</p>

<p>According to Giuliani some 56 million lire (29,000 euros) had been paid into a bank account opened in Carlo's memory. Funds are to be used for a school to be built for children of a West Sahara refugee camp, symbolic adoptions and Palestinian orphans.</p>

<p>Mario Placanica, the 21-year-old carabinieri policeman who fatally wounded Giuliani as he threatened officers in a police car with a fire extinguisher, has said he was "sorry" about the death.</p>

<p>"I feel very bad about this," he told Corriere della Sera newspaper, in spite of a request by police top brass that he not comment on the Genoa tragedy.</p>

<p>"I never expected to be in a situation like this. I'm sorry. I could not do anything else. If I had been able to choose and avoid what happened, I would have done so," he said.</p>

<p>Giuliani has hinted at a possible meeting with the young policeman, who is from the southern Calabria region, but said in an interview it was still too early to see him now.</p>

<p>The anti-globalization umbrella organization Genoa Social Forum called the "killing of Carlo Giuliani a point of no return for everyone, the culmination of three days of police brutality on which light must be shed up to the highest level of responsibility."</p>

<p>Hundreds of people were injured and scores arrested in police crackdowns on peaceful demonstrators and rioters during the three-day summit. </p>

<p>Rioting also caused major damage to businesses and property in Genoa whose central area was closed down for nearly a week amid fears for the safety of summit participants.</p>
