GENEVA  - A report released Tuesday by the

humanitarian group

Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF - <a href="http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org" target="_new">Doctors Without Borders</a>) says

almost no new

drugs are being developed for diseases that primarily affect the

world's

poor populations. 

<P>

The MSF report, titled "Fatal Imbalance: The Crisis in Research

and

Development for Drugs for Neglected Diseases", states that in the

last five

years the world's 11 leading pharmaceutical corporations have

placed just

one tuberculosis medication on the market. <P>

The combined sales of these transnational laboratories reach

approximately

117 billion dollars annually. <P>

Eight of these 11 companies "have conducted no research in the

last year

for fatal diseases that almost exclusively affect the poor:

sleeping

sickness, Chagas disease and leishmaniasis," according to the

Paris-based

MSF, 1999 winner of the Nobel Peace Prize. <P>

The release of the report coincided with the opening in Geneva of

the Global

Forum for Health Research, whose goal is precisely "to correct

this

inequitable and inefficient gap." 

<P>

The Forum, an international foundation based in this Swiss city,

unites

representatives of governments, universities, the pharmaceutical

industry,

United Nations agencies, research centers and non-governmental

organizations

(NGOs). 

<P>

The chairman of the Forum, Adetokunbo Lucas, of the Harvard School

of Public

Health, said Tuesday that the public and private sectors spend

more than 70

billion dollars annually on health-related research and

development. <P>

But just 10 percent of that sum is spent on research on 90 percent

of the

world's existing health problems, which the Forum considers a

misallocation

of resources, known as the "10/90 gap", and proposes to correct

within the

next 30 years. <P>

Mozambique's Prime Minister Pascual Mocumbi commented that it is

lamentable

that the elimination of the health gap will require such a long-

term effort. 

<P>

"We need to utilize better the 10 percent that we have, and

broaden our

thinking about how to allocate additional resources made available

over

time," he said in his speech inaugurating the meeting of the

Forum. 

<P>

Walter Fust, director of the Swiss Agency for Development and

Cooperation,

commented that the "10/90 gap" is "ignominious". <P>

Fust said "the profits from developing new medications for a

disease that

affects mostly the poorest countries of the world are judged by

the

pharmaceutical industry to be too small to justify new

investments." 

<P>

In 'Fatal Imbalance'', the director of MSF's Campaign for Access

to

Essential Medicines, Bernard Pécoul, states that "millions of

people in

developing countries are dying every year because the only drugs

available

to treat many infectious diseases are old, toxic or

ineffective." 

<P>

Nearly 10 percent of the global disease burden involves tropical

diseases,

but almost no new medicines are being developed, and drug

resistance is

making the drugs we do have useless, says Pécoul. <P>

The MSF report says that, of the 1,393 new medications approved

between 1975

and 1999, just 13 - or one percent - were aimed at treating

tropical

diseases, demonstrating the "dire lack of drug R&D into

unprofitable

diseases." <P>

"Drugs are not developed according to public health need, but

according to

profitability," said Pécoul. <P>

MSF is currently funding three pilot drug development projects on

drugs for

malaria, leishmaniasis and sleeping sickness, working in

partnership with

experts from Brazil, Thailand, Malaysia and Burkina Faso. <P>

The Global Forum for Health Research, which has the backing of the

World

Health Association (WHO), concludes its four-day sessions Friday.
