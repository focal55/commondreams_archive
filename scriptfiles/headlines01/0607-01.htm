WASHINGTON  - Opening a new front in the battle to

promote international women's rights, a prominent US group filed a

lawsuit Wednesday against President George W. Bush for curbing the

free-speech rights of overseas groups which provide reproductive

health services to women. 

<P>

The New York-based Center for Reproductive Law and Policy (CRLP)

claims that by barring all US aid from foreign health groups which

provide abortion services or lobby their governments to ease anti-

abortion laws, Bush is violating CRLP's freedoms of expression and

association guaranteed under the US constitution's first

amendment. <P>

''President Bush took away my right to speak because I support a

position with which he disagrees: that access to safe and legal

abortion is a human right of women worldwide,'' said Janet

Benshoof, CRLP's president. ''The global gag rule is global

censorship that violates fairness, freedom, and democracy.'' <P>

The lawsuit, which is backed by several major US human rights

groups including Human Rights Watch and the Lawyers Committee on

Human Rights, targets an executive order put out by Bush in late

January on only his second day in office. <P>

Called the ''global gag rule'' by its foes, the order re-imposed

the so-called ''Mexico City Policy'' proclaimed by Ronald Reagan

in 1984 and rescinded by Bill Clinton in 1993. The rule has long

been a top priority of the US anti-abortion movement and Christian

Right. <P>

Those forces, which are particularly strong in the Republican-led

House of Representatives, fought Clinton to a draw on the issue in

the late 1990's, when they made reinstatement of the rule a

condition for paying US arrears to the United Nations. <P>

They mustered a razor-thin majority to affirm the policy in a

House vote last month. But the Senate, now under Democratic

leadership, is expected to reject it when it takes up the 2002

foreign aid bill later this summer. Its fate will eventually have

to be hashed out in negotiations between the two chambers and

Bush, unless the courts throw it out.  

<P>

Washington, the world's single biggest bilateral funder of

population programs for poor countries, contributes on average

more than 400 million dollars a year, much of which is provided

directly by the US Agency for International Development (USAID)

and to private, non-governmental organizations (NGOs). 

<P>

Under a 1972 law, these groups have been forbidden from using any

USAID money they receive to actually perform abortions. But the

Mexico City Policy went a step further, by barring them from

receiving any US aid money if they performed abortions, lobbied

their governments to ease antiabortion laws, or even provide

medical referrals for abortions, even if they used only their own

money to do so. 

<P>

The result is that about ten overseas NGOs, including the

International Planned Parenthood Federation (IPPF), have been

denied millions of dollars in US funding, although many more, less

powerful and less well-endowed overseas NGOs have accepted the US

aid and the Mexico City conditions which come with it. 

<P>

''The global gag rule forces health care organizations to make an

immoral choice: either give up desperately needed funds for family

planning and other reproductive health care services, or give up

their right to free speech and to provide patients with full and

accurate medical information,'' according to CRLP, which works

closely with overseas NGOs in promoting the reproductive rights of

women.  

<P>

''In Peru, where abortion is illegal and maternal mortality rates

are the third highest in the region, clinic doctors and hospitals

ignore bleeding women who need post-abortion care because they're

afraid of losing US funding.'' noted Julia Ernst, CRLP's

international legislative counsel.  <P>

The lawsuit argues that the rule has a chilling effect on

recipient NGOs who feel they cannot afford to participate in the

public debates in their countries over reproductive rights and

abortion - or even to provide information to CRLP - without

risking their access to US aid funds.  

<P>

''Many foreign organizations can no longer work in partnership

with my organization, cannot attend events at the United Nations

at which we are speaking, cannot meet with us and provide us

information about the situation in their own country,'' said

Benshoof.  

<P>

As a result, the CRLP's ability to pursue abortion-law reform in

other countries or even to alert the US public about reproductive-

rights issues abroad is made much more difficult by the rule,

affecting its rights to free speech and association under both the

US Constitution and international human-rights law.  <P>

''We are doing this to establish that the US government cannot

restrict the speech of American human rights advocates working in

the United States or overseas,'' said Benshoof. ''American

citizens' First Amendment rights are 'without borders.'''  <P>

In several cases, overseas groups have declined to appear at

public forums with CRLP or have curtailed its participation at

local events for fear of losing access to US aid, according to the

complaint, which was filed in federal court in New York Wednesday.  

<P>

The rule is also fundamentally unfair, says CRLP, which has never

received US funding. Even where abortion is legal, CRLP's foreign

partners are forbidden to speak out about abortion rights, while

groups working to criminalize abortion or increase restrictions on

access to abortion in poor countries will not be denied US aid.  

<P>

The lawsuit enjoys the backing of several major human rights

groups.  <P>

''Governments should not impede non-violent advocates of public

policy from adding their voices to the international marketplace

of ideas,'' according to Michael Posner, the director of the

Lawyers Committee, who filed an affidavit with the court..  <P>

''When a US-based NGO seeks to change US policies that infringe on

international human rights norms, such as restrictions on freedom

of speech and association, they must not be restricted in their

ability to gain and publicize evidence of the impact of such

policies from NGOs in other countries,'' he said.  <P>

''In over 38 years of experience in the human rights field, (this)

is the only time I have encountered US censorship promoting law

reform through democratic processes,'' wrote Aryeh Neier,

president of the Open Society Institute and a founder and former

director of Human Rights Watch.  <P>

''The entire human rights movement relies on the ability of NGOs

like CRLP to gather information and speak without impediment and

to associate freely with foreign NGOs to increase the

effectiveness of their speech and advocacy,'' Neier added.
