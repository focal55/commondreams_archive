RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP)   In past summers, the two Palestinian

teen-agers canoed, shared cabins and talked peace with Israelis

their age at a camp in rural Maine.

<p>   This summer, Mai Abu-Emera and Mashour Arori, both 16, will stay

home. Palestinians aren't sending anyone to the Seeds of Peace camp

following eight months of fighting that has left hundreds dead.

<p>   For now, Israelis are still going; they are to be joined in the

camp's Mideast program by teen-agers from Jordan, Egypt and

Morocco.

<p>   But citing the recent violence, the Palestinian Ministry of

Education said it has advised against sending a delegation this

year.

<p>   ''Our situation is so difficult, we are not in a position to

participate this year,'' said Numan Sharif, a ministry official in

charge of the Seeds of Peace program for the Palestinians.

<p>   Still, Sharif said many Israeli and Palestinian campers from

past years are keeping in touch through phone calls, e-mails and an

Internet message board set up for campers who refer to themselves

as ''seeds''.

<p>   Sharif's Israeli counterpart, Hadara Rosenblum, acknowledged the

Israeli decision to send delegates to Maine was agonizing.

<p>   ''There are times we say we have someone to talk to on the other

side and there are periods when we don't. We are very confused,''

Rosenblum said.

<p>   Ultimately, she said, escalating violence could lead the

Israelis to pull out, too.

<p>   The camp's founder, John Wallach, said he held out hope

last-minute developments   a brittle cease-fire may be taking hold

this week   might allow the Palestinians to come. But time is

running short, with camp to begin at the end of June in Otisfield,

Maine.

<p>   Either way, he said, the camp and its mission will persevere.

<p>   ''Seeds of Peace has been going on and will go on,'' Wallach

said by telephone from New York.

<p>   Abu-Emera said trust has vanished after so many funerals.

Discussing peace over hikes and campfires is impossible now, she

said.

<p>   ''We had so much hope and a feeling of power, but now it's all

fading,'' Abu-Emera said while sitting with Arori in a classroom at

their West Bank school.

<p>   She said it was easier for the Israelis to go to camp because

their reality has not been as radically altered by the fighting.

<p>   Since fighting began Sept. 28, nearly 500 people have been

killed on the Palestinian side and more than 100 on the Israeli

side. Among the dead is one of Seeds of Peace's own, 17-year-old

Asel Asleh, an Arab Israeli shot by Israeli police during

pro-Palestinian riots in October.

<p>   Most of the violence has taken place in the West Bank and Gaza

Strip, where Palestinian towns have come under repeated assault by

Israeli forces retaliating for anti-Israel attacks. But dozens of

Jewish settlers have also been shot, and suicide bombings in

Israeli cities have left people afraid to walk the streets.

<p>   After Israel retaliated for a May suicide bombing by sending

F-16 warplanes to rocket security installations in his hometown of

Ramallah and elsewhere, Arori said a fellow Israeli seed, Rita

Konaev, was among the first to call.

<p>   ''It was good to feel that at least one Israeli was thinking

about what the Palestinians feel,'' Arori said.

<p>   Konaev, 15, from the northern town of Afula, said she runs up

her phone bills keeping in touch with the Palestinian, Egyptian and

Jordanian friends she made at camp.

<p>   She is upset the Palestinians won't be at camp this summer.

<p>   ''Even though we are just kids without any influence, we are

among the only ones still talking to each other,'' she said. ''It

(camp) is the only rational thing we have going at this point.''
