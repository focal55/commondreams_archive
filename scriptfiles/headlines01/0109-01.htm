UNITED NATIONS  - A coalition of about 280 non-

governmental

organisations (NGOs) from 70 countries Monday urged governments to

curb the

global trafficking in small arms which is responsible for the

deaths of

hundreds of thousands of civilians worldwide. 

<P>

The International Action Network on Small Arms (IANSA), which

launched its

global campaign on the opening day of a two-week preparatory

meeting here on

the illicit trade in small arms, said about half a billion of

these weapons

are

currently in circulation outside lawful control. 

<P>

''Gun running sustains bloody combat and repression the world

over, but the

proliferation of small arms has been particularly devastating in

Africa,''

says

Conmany Wesseh, Director of the Centre for Democratic Empowerment

in

Liberia, a

member of IANSA. 

<P>

Professor Wendy Cukier of Canada's Coalition for Gun Control,

points out that

gun running contributes to the deaths of more than half a million

people each

year. 

<P>

''For every death, many more are injured and traumatised. The

death rates in

many countries at peace are as high as those at war,'' she adds.  

<P>

Moreover, unlike illicit drugs, which are generally illegal

throughout their

trafficking life, virtually all illicit arms begin as legal

weapons - whether

in the hands of state armies, police or civilians, she argues. 

<P>

In July the United Nations will hold a major conference on the

'Illicit Trade

in Small Arms and Light Weapons'. 

<P>

The preparatory meeting, which began Monday, is expected to

discuss both

substantive and procedural issues relating to the upcoming

conference. The

conference will approve a programme of action to help curb the

flow of small

arms and adopt political declaration setting out commitments by

the UN's 189

member states. 

<P>

Perhaps the most sensitive issue before the conference will be the

question of

balancing the sovereign right of states to safeguard their

national security

with the pressing need to regulate the proliferation of small arms

and light

weapons. 

<P>

The preparatory committee, comprising all 189 member states, is

expected to

establish several working groups to deal with the following:

measures to

prevent, combat and eliminate the illicit manufacture,

acquisition,

stockpiling

and transfer of small arms; measures related to stockpile

management, safe

storage and destruction of illicit surplus small arms; and

measures related to

transparency and exchange of information. 

<P>

Since 1997, there have been a number of global and regional

initiatives to

curb

the illicit trade in small arms: a moratorium on the import,

export and

manufacture of small arms in West Africa initiated by the Economic

Community of

West African States (ECOWAS) and the Inter-American Convention

against the

Illicit Manufacturing and Trafficking in Firearms, Ammunition,

Explosives and

Other Related Materials. 

<P>

Additionally, the European Union has a Joint Action on Small Arms

while the

Council of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) has

an agreement

on the Prevention and Combating of Illicit Trafficking in Small

Arms and

Related Crimes. 

<P>

''Governments have talked about the need to stem the proliferation

of small

arms,'' says Joost Hiltermann, executive director of the Arms

Division of

Human

Rights Watch. But so far, he says, it has been all talk - and no

action.  

<P>

Human Rights Watch is not only calling for binding codes on arms

transfers,

but

also the establishment of transparency measures, including annual

reporting of

arms sales, and the creation of a UN Register for Small Arms. 

<P>

The existing eight-year-old UN Arms Register, on the other hand,

only records

the import and export of fighter aircraft, combat helicopters,

missiles,

warships and heavy artillery - and excludes small arms. 

<P>

A UN expert panel has identified ''small arms'' to include assault

rifles,

pistols, sub-machine guns, light machine guns, mortars, portable

anti-aircraft

guns, grenade launchers, anti-tank missile and rocket systems,

hand grenades

and anti-personnel land mines. 

<P>

Hilterman also points out that many of the weapons on the black

market at some

point were legally transferred by governments or with government

approval.

''And governments have failed to rein in unscrupulous arms

traffickers or

enforce arms embargoes imposed on human rights abusers,'' he

notes. 

<P>

Michel Rocard, a former French prime minister and head of an

Eminent Persons

Group on small arms, says the preparatory process for the

conference is at

once

promising as it is discouraging. 

<P>

On the one hand, the gap between supplier and recipient States is

manifesting

itself with respect to scope and mandate for the conference, he

adds.  

<P>

At issue is whether or not to restrict the conference scope to

illicit

traffic,

or to keep calls for transparency and accountability in licit

production and

transfer included. 

<P>

''Unfortunately, parochial political, economic and security

interests of a few

(arms) supplier States are impeding, if not derailing the

process,'' he warns. 

<P>

In a report released last year, the Eminent Persons Group, said

the

majority of

small arms producers are located in the First World while the

majority of

victims of small arms are in the Third World. 

<P>

The Group includes several former and present political leaders

including

Alpha

Oumar Konare of Mali, Eduard Shevardnadze of Georgia and Narasimha

Rao of

India, as well as the former head of the Iraqi arms inspection

team Rolf Ekeus

and former World Bank chief Robert McNamara.  

<P>

The Group pointed out that the five permanent members of the UN

Security

Council, namely the United States, Britain, France, China and

Russia, account

for around 85 percent of the global arms trade. 

<P>

At the same time, about 40 percent of the worldwide flow of small

arms is

attributed to illicit trafficking while the majority of illicit

weapons

originate in the licit trade. 

<P>

Since 1990, says the report, small arms have been the primary

choice of

weaponry in 47 of the 49 civil conflicts.
