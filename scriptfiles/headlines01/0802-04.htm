CAPE TOWN  -Senior South African figures slammed the United States Thursday for threatening to boycott a UN conference on racism, and condemned the "evasive" language of draft declarations.

<p>National Assembly speaker Frene Ginwala, attending a preparatory conference in Cape Town, said she found it unacceptable that the United States, which guaranteed freedom of speech in its constitution, wanted to exclude Zionism and reparations for slavery from the agenda of the week-long conference, due to open in the east coast city of Durban on August 31.</p><p>Education Minister Kader Asmal, addressing the same conference, said reparations could not be brushed under the carpet. </p><p>"It cannot be deemed inconvenient or merely impolitic and therefore forbidden in discussions," he said.</p><p>"Nobody should be able to badger us into silence through threats of boycott and related silliness."</p><p>He added that passions had "run to some lengths" on the status of Zionism as a form of racism.</p><p>Those who thought that Zionism was inherently racist had to reckon with the fact that some of the most courageous anti-apartheid whites in South Africa happened to have been Zionists as well, he said.</p>

<p>"We need to debate these matters rather than to arrest debate in favor of simplistic dogmas and slogans. That is the purpose that this upcoming conference should serve."</p>

<p>Barney Pityana, chairman of South Africa's Human Rights Commission, said the current drafts of a conference declaration and program of action were so dense and evasive they risked being ineffective.</p>

<p>"We will have words at this rate, but whether it will be words that mean anything, I have doubts," he said.</p><p>Pityana said the broadly-worded draft documents, under discussion in Geneva, were "so evasive of many of the issues we raised" that a sharpness intended by the UN General Assembly would be lost.</p>

<p>Pityana said the General Assembly had asked for a clearly structured strategic program to undertake specific actions, to account for them in a certain time and to give the United Nations the resources it needed for its own activities to combat racism.</p>

<p>"So far I see nothing like that in the documents that we have," Pityana said.</p><p>"I don't get the sense we are making those advances that I think are necessary."</p><p>Pityana said he was seeking something distinctive from Durban, similar to the Vienna declaration on human rights, that would become a rallying cry in the fight against racism.</p><p>"Frankly it is yet to be born. It is not in the papers I have."</p><p>Human rights commissioner Pansy Tlakula, who chaired Thursday's meeting, said she found the language being used in UN documents problematic as it was "not plain English."</p><p>"When you read a paragraph sometimes (it doesn't) make sense to ordinary people," she said.</p><p>The South African Non-Governmental Coalition (SANGCO) earlier accused the United States of arrogance bordering on self-interest for threatening to boycott the conference.</p><p>"It is ironic that the nation that claims to be the defender of the 'free world' consistently uses its considerable economic and military might to pursue its own narrow interests," said Sangoco executive director Abie Ditlhake.</p><p>Foreign Minister Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma said in Pretoria meanwhile that preparations for the conference were on track.</p><p>"We think from our side things are really on momentum," she said at the launch of a postage stamp to mark the conference, which is due to be attended by around 12,000 delegates, including at least 30 heads of state.</p><p>Dlamini-Zuma, said she would would travel to Geneva on August 6 to join delegates thrashing out the draft documents.</p><p>On Monday she described the US boycott threat as regrettable, but on Thursday said it was no cause to panic.</p><p>"Racism by its very nature will mean that people will have different experiences and outlooks, so it will be a miracle if we assume that people will think alike," she said.</p><p>"What is important is that at the end of the conference we arrive at some common ground and come up with a document ... to deal with the scourge of racism."</p>
