LONDON   - Environmentalists who suggest forests

can be used to absorb excess carbon dioxide (CO2) accumulating

in the Earth's atmosphere and contributing to global warming

may have to think again.

<p>Researchers at the University of Michigan and Duke

University in North Carolina have completed a seven-year study

which raises doubts about the ability of forests, so-called

carbon sinks, to soak up the excess CO2 being pumped into the

atmosphere from exhaust pipes and smoke stacks.

<p>Using forests to fight global warming, a plan backed by the

United States, was one of the disputed points at the heart of

the failed U.N. climate conference in The Hague   last year.

<p>The new research by the American scientists shows a

shortage of water and nutrients in the soil could limit how

trees respond to increases in CO2.

<p>``In terms of rising atmospheric CO2, I believe we need to

consider the fertility of the site when we are thinking about

how much carbon sequestration (absorption) we have now and how

much we can project in the future,'' David Ellsworth said in a

telephone interview Wednesday.

<p>The finding does not change the situation very much for

current carbon sinks, he said, but it could have serious

implications on future predictions.

<p>``If we are trying to value future carbon sinks, this could

be incredibly important in the sense that future carbon sinks

may not be as large as we have anticipated based on

shorter-term studies and modeling activities,'' Ellsworth added.

<p>The assistant professor of plant physiological ecology and

colleagues examined the effects of elevated CO2 on forests with

limited nutrients over many years. They also exposed trees to

increased CO2 to simulate conditions predicted in 50 years

time.

<p>ROLE OF SOIL ALSO QUESTIONED

<p>Their results are reported in the current issue of science

journal Nature along with a study by other Duke scientists

which questions the role of soils as long-term carbon sinks.

<p>Until now the impact of soil nutrients has not been

considered as a factor in a tree's ability to absorb CO2, but

Ellsworth and his colleagues said it should be.

<p>``The debate over how much CO2 trees will absorb should

consider the limitations of soil fertility or other key

resources in low supply,'' he said.

<p>``It makes the playing ground a lot more complicated to

evaluate,'' Ellsworth added.

<p>The dispute between the European Union  and the United

States at the climate talks was mainly over carbon sinks. The

U.S. plan called for developed nations to be allowed to count

CO2 soaked up by forests against targets for cutting greenhouse

gas emissions.

<p>Opponents of the scheme argued that it could lead to a rise

in global emissions.

<p>``I don't think we can assume existing forests, with their

fertility limitations, will completely offset rising CO2

without soil amendments,'' said Ellsworth.

<p>``We will more likely find solutions in measures such as

burning less fossil fuel and planting more trees in

high-nutrient soils,'' he added.

<p>But the scientists cautioned that adding nutrients to the

soil may involve other negative effects on the environment.
