BRUSSELS - The European Union, caught up in a trans-Atlantic row over climate change, accused the United States on Wednesday of breaking its word and trying to sabotage the Kyoto protocol behind the scenes.

<p>"What we are worried about is, that the United States promised not to obstruct the Kyoto process," EU Environment Commissioner Margot Wallstroem told reporters ahead of a key climate-change meeting in Bonn.</p><p>"This might be a matter of definition, of what 'obstruction' means, but we can see that the Americans are clearly doing some work to convince their partners in the umbrella group," she said.</p><p>She added: "It might be necessary to talk to the Americans about this."</p><p>The six-nation umbrella group, led by the United States, includes Japan and Australia, where Wallstroem failed to win outright support for EU plans to press ahead with Kyoto despite its rejection by President George W. Bush.</p><p>The other umbrella group nations are Canada, Russia and Norway.</p><p>During the EU-US summit in Sweden last month, Bush and EU leaders agreed to disagree on Kyoto, as they tried to keep climate change from becoming too much of an irritant in their relations.</p><p>Wallstroem's allegation of foul play by the Bush administration, however, indicated that Brussels was firmly digging its heels in ahead of Sunday's start of the two-week COP-6 meeting of Kyoto signatory nations.</p><p>Dutch Environment Minister Jan Pronk, who is to chair the Bonn meeting, said Tuesday that Australia and Canada were backsliding on their commitments, while Japan was insisting on US participation.</p><p>Wallstroem, putting the best spin on a failed trip last week to Tokyo and Canberra, revealed that the European Union did not expect to convince either capital to ratify Kyoto without Washington doing so as well.</p><p>She said her concern now was that a lack of headway in Bonn will sap public support for the Kyoto protocol, which sets out binding targets for industrialized nations to cut emissions of carbon dioxide and other gases suspected of causing global warming.</p><p>"I clearly see the risk that the public and stakeholders, including business, will loss confidence in the process if we don't make progress in Bonn," she said.</p>

<p>For Kyoto to go into force, it must be ratified by 55 countries which together represent 55 percent of greenhouse gas emissions. Despite their repeated declarations in support of the protocol, none of the 15 EU member states have yet ratified it.</p>
