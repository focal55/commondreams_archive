OTTAWA, Jul 8 (IPS) - Canada is said to have more unpolluted fresh

water than any other nation, but environmentalists and anti-

globalization activists say the country risks losing its precious

resource. <P>

</table>Critics of Canadian environmental and trade policy say Canada is

squandering water by gutting environmental agencies and allowing

large amounts of water to become contaminated. At the same time,

some Canadian provinces are flirting with the idea of bulk exports

of water to the United States and other countries where supplies

are becoming scarce. 

<P>

Environmentalists and free-trade opponents have seized upon last

year's contamination of the drinking water in the small town of

Walkerton, Ontario as a case study in the perils of privatization,

deregulation, and free trade. The incident left seven people dead

and more than 2,000 with illnesses caused by E-Coli, out of a

total population of 8,000. 

<P>

E-Coli is a bacterium. It causes haemolytic uremic syndrome, the

symptoms of which include stomach pain, fever and severe diarrhea,

which can lead to bloody diarrhea. <P>

The bacterium seeped into Walkerton's wells from nearby hog farms.

Local officials tried to cover up the contamination but were

forced to go public when sheer numbers of patients overwhelmed the

town's hospitals and clinics Most of the people who died were

residents of seniors' homes. <P>

At the end of June, after months of hearings into the tragedy,

Ontario Premier Mike Harris took responsibility for any role his

government played in the tainted water tragedy while brushing

aside the argument that he and his cabinet ignored the safety

risks of slashing the environment ministry's budget. 

<P>

His government had cut 48 percent of the financing for the

environment ministry in Canada's largest province after coming to

power in 1995 on a pledge to balance budgets and streamline

government services. It also privatized water-testing labs and

handed management of water treatment to municipalities. In

Walkerton, the manager of the water works confessed that he did

not understand how testing worked, and that he often drank alcohol

on the job. 

<P>

Harris dismissed a series of cabinet documents and published

reports that detailed the risks and insisted that his government

did not ignore warnings of threats to the environment. <P>

"We weren't given any advice that any of the reductions of the

actual dollar expenditures led to any increase to the risk to

health by any ministry, including the environment," he told a

judicial inquiry called by his own government. <P>

Harris denied his government targeted the environment ministry

because of distaste for regulation, and pointed out that the

tourism ministry's budget was cut by 80 percent between 1995 and

2000. <P>

He admitted, however, that the Walkerton deaths were a "wake-up

call" to the province, Canada and the rest of the world. 

<P>

While environmentalists are using the Walkerton tragedy to draw

attention to the risks of privatizing services and government

budget cuts they say have sapped environmental protection

agencies, anti-globalization activists worry that multinational

corporations will take advantage of Canada's pro-free trade

policies and cash-hungry decentralized governments to get

permission to export water. 

<P>

Tony Clark, head of the non-governmental Polaris Institute and an

organizer of the Jul 6-8 conference on 'Water for People and

Nature' in the western city of Vancouver, says the wasting and

polluting of drinking water and the pressure for permission to

export water are linked. 

<P>

Greed, he says, is the common factor. <P>

"Multinational corporations want to make money selling water,

whether it's bottled water for drinking or bulk water for

agribusiness, without regard for the cycle of water in the place

where the water is taken, nor for the pollution issues in the

place where the water is sold," says Clark. <P>

Citizens' groups at this weekend's conference, he adds, are

saying, "We need to rebuild and recover the water in aquifers in

all of our countries. Shipping water is a stop-gap solution that

only enriches multinational corporations while doing irreparable

harm to the countries involved." <P>

Clark says he finds it ironic that Canada's most notorious recent

water poisoning incident, at Walkerton, was caused by seeping

contamination from agribusiness plants, while, at the same time,

Canada is being pressured to export water to countries where

agribusiness waste has destroyed drinking water supplies. <P>

He disagrees with the argument that water should be traded and

priced as a commodity in order to reduce wastage by consumers. <P>

"It's not ordinary people who waste water. It's large industries

and agribusiness. They can afford to buy water from other

corporations, but ordinary people can't," Clark asserts. <P>

"The consensus here is definitely against water exports and

further privatization of water utilities. There simply is nothing

to be gained by ordinary people by putting the most precious

commodity in the world into the hands of a few corporations,"

Clark says.
