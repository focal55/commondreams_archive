MORE than 140,000 glossy brochures sponsored by the US corporate giants of genetic modification such as  Monsanto are being pushed into  Scotland's schools by Scottish Enterprise, with the enthusiastic backing of the schools  watchdog HM  Inspectorate of Education.<p>

The brochures, which sing the praises of GM technology in medicine and marine science, have provoked widespread protests from teachers,  consumer groups and  environ-mentalists. They are suspicious that GM companies are trying to soften up students as part of a campaign to quell mounting public fears about the dangers of genetic  engineering.<p>

</table>The &quot;infiltration&quot; of industry into the curriculum worried the Educational Institute of  Scotland, the trade union  representing teachers. The  institute's general secretary, Ronnie Smith, wanted Scottish Enterprise and HM  Inspec-torate of Education to  exercise more critical judgement, and urged teachers to do the same. <p>

&quot;I think every product of  industry that purports to be a curriculum resource should be viewed carefully by teachers  before they use it,&quot; he said. &quot;Most commercial organisations do not involve themselves in this area out of a charitable concern to help  education.&quot;<p>

Your World - Biotechnology And You is a 16-page full-colour magazine produced in the US by the Biotechnology Institute. The institute was founded two years ago in Pennsylvania to promote public understanding of GM  science. It is funded by  Monsanto, Novartis, Pfizer, Rhone-Poulenc, Merck, Amgen and the 900-member  Bio technology Industry  Organisation.<p>

Up to 20,000 copies of seven editions of Your World are this month being sent to 600 schools and colleges throughout  Scotland as a &quot;teacher's resource for biotechnology education&quot;. In promoting the magazine, neither Scottish Enterprise nor HM  Inspectorate of Education  mentioned the fact that it has been sponsored by multi national GM companies.<p>

Those who represent the  interests of parents also  expressed alarm. &quot;Pressure is increasing on schools to accept industry-led sponsorship and marketing,&quot; observed Martyn Evans, the director of the  Scottish  Consumer Council. He said that was why, along with the  National Consumer  Council in London, his organisation was now  updating guidelines for schools on industrial sponsorship. &quot;Schools have to be  particularly careful in accepting sponsored materials or  products,&quot; he said. &quot;The biotech companies behind the  magazine are using the  provision of education as a marketing opportunity É to  influence pupils.&quot;<p>

 However, in the blurb accompanying the magazine, Dr Jack Jackson, HM Inspector of Schools, writes: &quot;Your World is a valuable  resource for Scottish Science teachers and should help inform pupils and raise their awareness of the many benefits and issues which  surround the development of this exciting new technology.&quot; <p>

The magazines cover genes and medicine, tissue engineering, Aids, the brain, diagnostics, computing and marine bio technology. They are peppered with quotes and profiles of  industrialists and ideas for classroom activities and often end with positive accounts of recent developments in gene science.<p>

The most recent Your World, which the Biotechnology  Institute hopes will be circulated to Scottish schools in the future, covers the  controversial area of GM food. It has enthusiastic  articles on &quot;creating better plants&quot; as well as a piece knocking organic  farming, and suggests children should experiment by growing Monsanto's GM soybean seeds.<p>

&quot;We want to make these  magazines available to Scottish teachers on a regular basis,&quot; the Biotechnology Institute's Jeff Davidson told the Sunday  Herald from Pennsylvania last week.   He argued that the use of GM in medicine was  uncontroversial, and pointed out that Your World, though sponsored by GM companies, was actually produced by  academics and science writers. He accepted, however, that GM foods aroused more fears in  Europe than they did in the US, and suggested the presentation of the issue in Scotland might need rethinking.<p>

One anti-GM group, Glasgow-based Scottish Genetix Action, is so  angry about what it sees as the bias and prejudice of the brochures that it has demanded they be withdrawn immediately from classrooms. &quot;Corporations are taking hold of our education system,&quot; said the group's Scott Armstrong.<p>

Neither the Scottish  Executive nor HM Inspectorate were  willing to comment last week,  referring questions to the  Executive's Dundee-based  agency, Learning and Teaching  Scotland. It too was unable to make any public statements, though insiders privately  defended the use of Your World on the grounds that its articles were directly related to parts of the fifth and sixth-year biology curriculum.<p>

Scottish Enterprise's bio technology director, Peter Lennox, dismissed criticisms   of the involvement of GM  companies as nonsense. &quot;I'm flabbergasted that anyone should raise this,&quot; he said. &quot;It didn't even cross our minds.  I thought it was just knowledge. Biotechnology is an enigma wrapped in a mystery and there is a lack of knowledge about it.&quot;
