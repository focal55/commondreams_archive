PARIS  - Under the influence of U.S. oil companies,

the government of George W. Bush initially blocked U.S. secret

service investigations on terrorism, while it bargained with the

Taliban the delivery of Osama bin Laden in exchange for political

recognition and economic aid, two French intelligence analysts

claim.

<P>

   In the book ''Bin Laden, la verite interdite'' (''Bin Laden,

the forbidden truth''), that appeared in Paris on Wednesday, the

authors, Jean-Charles Brisard and Guillaume Dasquie, reveal that

the Federal Bureau of Investigation's deputy director John O'Neill

resigned in July in protest over the obstruction. 

<P>

   Brisard claim O'Neill told them that ''the main obstacles to

investigate Islamic terrorism were U.S. Oil corporate interests

and the role played by Saudi Arabia in it''. 

<P>

   The two claim the U.S. government's main objective in

Afghanistan was to consolidate the position of the Taliban regime

to obtain access to the oil and gas reserves in Central Asia. 

<P>

   They affirm that until August, the U.S. government saw the

Taliban regime ''as a source of stability in Central Asia that

would enable the construction of an oil pipeline across Central

Asia'', from the rich oilfields in Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and

Kazakhstan, through Afghanistan and Pakistan, to the Indian Ocean. 

<P>

   Until now, says the book, ''the oil and gas reserves of Central

Asia have been controlled by Russia. The Bush government wanted to

change all that''. 

<P>

   But, confronted with Taliban's refusal to accept U.S.

conditions, ''this rationale of energy security changed into a

military one'', the authors claim. 

<P>

   ''At one moment during the negotiations, the U.S.

representatives told the Taliban, 'either you accept our offer of

a carpet of gold, or we bury you under a carpet of bombs',''

Brisard said in an interview in Paris. 

<P>

   According to the book, the government of Bush began to

negotiate with the Taliban immediately after coming into power in

February. U.S. and Taliban diplomatic representatives met several

times in Washington, Berlin and Islamabad. 

<P>

   To polish their image in the United States, the Taliban even

employed a U.S. expert on public relations, Laila Helms. The

authors claim that Helms is also an expert in the works of U.S.

Secret services, for her uncle, Richard Helms, is a former

director of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). 

<P>

   The last meeting between U.S. And Taliban representatives took

place in August, five weeks before the attacks on New York and

Washington, the analysts maintain. 

<P>

   On that occasion, Christina Rocca, in charge of Central Asian

affairs for the U.S. Government, met the Taliban ambassador to

Pakistan in Islamabad. 

<P>

   Brisard and Dasquie have long experience in intelligence

analysis. Brisard was until the late 1990s director of economic

analysis and strategy for Vivendi, a French company. He also

worked for French secret services, and wrote for them in 1997 a

report on the now famous Al Qaeda network, headed by bin Laden. 

<P>

   Dasquie is an investigative journalist and publisher of

Intelligence Online, a respected newsletter on diplomacy, economic

analysis and strategy, available through the Internet. 

<P>

   Brisard and Dasquie draw a portrait of closest aides to

President Bush, linking them to oil business.  

<P>

   Bush's family has a strong oil background. So are some of his

top aides. From the U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney, through the

director of the National Security Council Condoleeza Rice, to the

Ministers of Commerce and Energy, Donald Evans and Stanley

Abraham, all have for long worked for U.S. Oil companies. 

<P>

   Cheney was until the end of last year president of Halliburton,

a company that provides services for oil industry; Rice was

between 1991 and 2000 manager for Chevron; Evans and Abraham

worked for Tom Brown, another oil giant. 

<P>

   Besides the secret negotiations held between Washington and

Kabul and the importance of the oil industry, the book takes issue

with the role played by Saudi Arabia in fostering Islamic

fundamentalism, in the personality of bin Laden, and with the

networks that the Saudi dissident built to finance his activities. 

<P>

   Brisard and Dasquie contend the U.S. Government's claim that it

had been prosecuting bin Laden since 1998. ''Actually,'' Dasquie

says, ''the first state to officially prosecute bin Laden was

Libya, on the charges of terrorism.'' 

<P>

   ''Bin Laden wanted settle in Libya in the early 1990s, but was

hindered by the government of Muammar Qaddafi,'' Dasquie claims.

''Enraged by Libya's refusal, bin Laden organized attacks inside

Libya, including assassination attempts against Qaddafi.'' 

<P>

   Dasquie singles out one group, the Islamic Fighting Group

(IFG), reputedly the most powerful Libyan dissident organization,

based in London, and directly linked with bin Laden. 

<P>

   ''Qaddafi even demanded Western police institutions, such as

Interpol, to pursue the IFG and bin Laden, but never obtained co-

operation,'' Dasquie says. ''Until today, members of IFG openly

live in London.'' 

<P>

   The book confirms earlier reports that the U.S. Government

worked closely with the United Nations during the negotiations

with the Taliban. 

<P>

   ''Several meetings took place this year, under the arbitration

of Francesc Vendrell, personal representative of UN secretary

general Kofi Annan, to discuss the situation in Afghanistan,''

says the book.  

<P>

   ''Representatives of the U.S. Government and Russia, and the

six countries that border with Afghanistan were present at these

meetings,'' it says. ''Sometimes, representatives of the Taliban

also sat around the table.'' 

<P>

   These meetings, also called ''6+2'' because of the number of

states (six neighbors plus U.S. And Russia) involved, have been

confirmed by Naif Naik, former Pakistani Minister for Foreign

Affairs.  

<P>

   In a French television news program two weeks ago, Naik said

during a ''6+2'' meeting in Berlin in July, the discussions turned

around ''the formation of a government of national unity. If the

Taliban had accepted this coalition, they would have immediately

received international economic aid.''  

<P>

   ''And the pipe lines from Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan would have

come,'' he added. 

<P>

   Naik also claimed that Tom Simons, the U.S. representative at

these meetings, openly threatened the Taliban and Pakistan.  

<P>

   ''Simons said, 'either the Taliban behave as they ought to, or

Pakistan convinces them to do so, or we will use another option'.

The words Simons used were 'a military operation','' Naik

claimed.</p>
