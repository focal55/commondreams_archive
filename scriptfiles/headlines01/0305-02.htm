Antonio Richardson will today become the 700th person to be executed since the death penalty was reintroduced in the United States. 
<P>The case of the 26-year-old is remarkable on several counts: Richardson is on the border of mental incapacity; he was only 16 at the time of his crime; he was persuaded to turn down a deal that would have kept him off death row; and the parents of his victims are divided on what should happen to him.  
<P>"Given the circumstances of his age and his background, this just isn't a case that cries out for giving him death," said Larry Denk, one of his lawyers.  
<P>Richardson and three others raped Robin Kerry, 19, and her sister Julie, 20, before pushing them to their deaths into the Mississippi river in St Louis.  
<P>Richardson, who has brain damage and an IQ of about 70, called police the next day to tell them of the crimes. All four confessed: one agreed to testify against the others in return for his life, and the other two were sentenced to die.  
<P>In the light of his cooperation, Richardson was offered a deal that would have given him a life sentence if he pleaded guilty. He intended to do so until he was visited in jail by a member of a group called the Coalition for Justice, which was trying to portray the case   as an anti-black frame-up.  
<P>They persuaded Richardson to change his plea and the boy, whose inexperienced lawyer failed to tell the court about his client's mental state, was sentenced to death.  
<P>Mr Denk said: "He was offered the opportunity to accept life in prison without parole. He turned that down, we submit, because of the intervention by certain activists whose interests were not compatible with Tony's.  
<P>"All we can say is that he's very remorseful about what happened. He's not asking for anything more than the state was prepared to offer him just before his trial."  
<P>Richardson will avoid the death penalty only in the unlikely event of late legal appeals succeeding or Missouri's governor granting clemency.  
<P>Organisations opposing the sentence include Amnesty International, the American Bar Association and the National Mental Health Association.  
<P>They are joined by Ginny Kerry, mother of the dead sisters. "I think that Antonio Richardson is responsible for what he did," she said. "But I requested clemency for him because of his youth and his diminished mental capacity."  
<P>Her ex-husband, Richard, takes a different view. "The governor knows that I'm for the death penalty and hopefully he'll do what's right."
