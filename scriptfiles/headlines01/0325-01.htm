WASHINGTON<wbr>--<wbr>During eight years of the Clinton administration, business lobbyist

Dan Danner was invited to the White House once. In two months under

President Bush, he has visited seven times, three of them for events

attended by the president.

<p>For business lobbyists like Danner, the good times roll.

<p>"We'd forgotten what it's like to have a business-friendly president

in the White House," said Danner, who works for the National Federation

of Independent Business. "I think people underestimated George W. Bush.

Things are happening more quickly than even people in the business

community expected."

</table>Business lobbyists say they suffered eight years of over-regulation

under Bill Clinton. The new administration, they contend, is not so much

giving them everything they want as simply listening to their concerns.

<p>Suggesting otherwise is their recent string of victories: Ending

costly ergonomic rules. Rolling back tough standards on arsenic levels in

drinking water. Proposing to suspend a requirement that miners post a

bond to clean up damage to the environment they create. Persuading Bush

to back away from a pledge to regulate carbon dioxide emissions at power

plants.

<p>Business isn't stopping there. The next targets include gaining

greater access to federal land for oil and gas exploration, striking a

Clinton administration policy banning road-building and logging in

back-country national forests and suspending a proposed rule to make

nutrition labeling mandatory on meat and poultry products.

<p>And individual industries have their own agendas. The health care

sector, for example, is seeking to stop a regulation to protect medical

privacy from going into effect, arguing that the rule is expensive,

burdensome and unworkable. The regulation, finalized in December, would

set strict limits on disclosure and distribution of patients' medical

information.

<p>Nowhere are the good times better than at the National Mining Assn.,

which has scored three victories since Bush took office.

<p>The industry group lauded Bush's decision to overturn the Clinton

administration's stringent regulations on arsenic in drinking water. It

opposed the rule--suspended Wednesday--that would have held miners

responsible for the environmental damage they cause on public lands. It

was pleased by Bush's decision not to seek to regulate carbon dioxide

emissions at power plants.

<p>And the industry has been buoyed by the administration's promotion of

coal as a partial solution to the nation's energy woes.

<p>But its wish list calls for much more: relaxing regulation of mercury

in coal plant emissions and forgetting about a proposed rule requiring

updated equipment at old power plants near national parks.

<p>Association spokesman John Grasser was steamed about speculation in

news reports that the new administration is rewarding the industry for

generous campaign contributions. "It's ridiculous," he said, to suggest

that "we make contributions and they turn around and give us our wish

list."

<p>Business' success with the administration has become a sensitive

subject on K Street, the Washington corridor lined with lobbyists'

offices. "The whole issue of whether big business is dominating this

administration is extremely touchy," said a spokesman for a trade

association who declined to comment on business' run of victories.

<p>Business lobbyists say they are not getting everything they want. For

example, Bush upheld a Clinton plan to require a drastic reduction of

sulfur in diesel exhaust from big trucks and buses.

<p>Still, business lobbyists say the atmosphere in Washington has changed

dramatically.

<p>"We're being listened to a lot more attentively by an administration

that includes in its senior ranks people for whom business is neither

defined as an enemy or an abstraction," said Michael Baroody, executive

vice president of the National Assn. of Manufacturers.

<p>During the Clinton years, the manufacturers' group struggled to get

senior administration officials to appear at its policy breakfasts. The

group's first speaker from the Bush administration: Vice President Dick

Cheney.

<p>Bill Fay, president and CEO of the American Highway Users Alliance,

said he received no response to a report he sent to the Clinton White

House estimating that fixing the nation's 167 worst traffic bottlenecks

could save 1 billion gallons of fuel a year. He recently mentioned the

report to a Bush aide working on the president's energy policy who he

said enthusiastically wanted more information.

<p>And Jerry Jordan, chairman of the Independent Petroleum Assn. of

America, never set foot in the Interior Department while Bruce Babbitt

was secretary under Clinton. But he said he already has been there to

meet with Bush's secretary, Gale A. Norton, to talk about easing

restrictions on oil and gas exploration on federal lands.

<b><br>

<p>Some Frozen Out

</b>

<p>On the other hand, those whose politics are out of sync with the White

House say they are getting the cold shoulder. Sen. Dianne Feinstein

(D-Calif.) asked weeks ago for a meeting with Bush to talk about

California's electricity crisis but has received no response.

<p>Mary Sophof, senior vice president and chief government affairs

officer of the Grocery Manufacturers of America, said that the new

administration is insisting that regulations be supported by science.

<p>During the Clinton years, said Dick Newpher, executive director of the

American Farm Bureau's Washington office, "there was a tendency of

regulatory authorities to feel like they had all the answers. That is not

the case with the Bush administration. They are very open and willing to

listen, even if they don't go your way every time."

<p>"With the previous administration, business was in the mode of damage

control," said Tim Hammonds, president and CEO of the Food Marketing

Institute, among a group of business owners who recently met with Bush at

the White House on tax cuts.

<p>"With this administration, you have a president that understands that

a healthy economy needs a healthy business community," Hammonds said. "So

they are at least willing to listen."

<p>Although Bush's pro-business tendencies are no surprise, lobbyists are

astonished by how fast the administration is moving. Though lobbyists

would love to take credit for the rapid-fire successes, Danner said the

White House is setting much of the agenda.

<p>In fact, the National Federation of Independent Business' nine

lobbyists--who helped kill the ergonomic rule and are now working to

repeal estate taxes--are looking forward to Congress' Easter break. "We

haven't had time to celebrate," Danner said. "We've been too busy. But

it's a heck of a lot more fun."

<p>Under Clinton, the federation devoted 98% of its lobbying time to

Congress. Now the group, which counted Bush among its members when he was

a Texas oilman, expends about one-third of its effort on the White House,

Danner said.

<p>Despite the recent successes, business lobbyists say they're not

getting cocky. The narrowly divided Senate means they can't afford to

ignore Democrats.

<p>"It's hard to feel euphoric when really any senator can hold something

up," said Scott H. Lane, also a lobbyist for the auto dealer association.

"You still need to get bipartisan support.

<p>But he said the recent victories have created a momentum for

businesses. "It's a much more exciting time for lobbyists in town.

There's more optimism with Bush. There are new people, new faces. That's

what lobbyists live for."

<b><br>

<p>Put on the Defensive

</b>

<p>Business' usual opponents suddenly find themselves on the defensive,

and they don't like it.

<p>"There's a new environment that has emboldened the business community

and demoralized those in opposition," said Travis Plunkett, lobbyist for

Consumer Federation of America, which recently lost its battle against

legislation making it more difficult to qualify for bankruptcy

protection.

<p>The reform package--which credit card issuers and banks have been

pushing for years--became a "train coming down the tracks" once Bush

administration officials expressed their support, Plunkett said.

<p>"What's different now is the speed at which things are moving,"

Plunkett said. "They clearly wanted to time this so it would hit before

campaign finance and tax cuts."
