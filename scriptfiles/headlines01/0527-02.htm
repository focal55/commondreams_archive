RUMBEK, Sudan - It was a proud moment for UNICEF when almost 4,000 Sudanese child soldiers were demobilized in February.

<P>

<P>Battle-hardened boys, some as young as 7, lined up along the scorched front lines of Sudan's 18-year civil war, dropped their rifles, linked hands, and walked onto United Nations cargo planes that were to carry them to freedom and a new life. 

<P>

<P>Since then, the project has been dogged by difficulty. Conditions in the demobilization camps were initially poor, and UNICEF was criticized by other aid agencies for its management of the project. Some child soldiers even staged what they called a ''strike'' to protest the conditions in which they were staying. Others, it turned out, had never been soldiers at all.

<P>

<P>UNICEF rejects the criticism and says that its quick actions, while imperfect, have saved hundreds of boys from possible death.

<P>

<P>''We are doing what we can to change one of Africa's nastier stories,'' said Sharad Sapra, UNICEF operations chief for southern Sudan.

<P>

<P>The project is a case study in the complexity of running an ambitious program in the middle of a war that Secretary of State Colin L. Powell has described as ''perhaps the greatest tragedy on the face of the Earth today.''

<P>

<P>Until recently, the Sudanese People's Liberation Army had an estimated 9,000 child soldiers. The children fell into the rebel ranks for various reasons: Some were orphans, having lost their parents in government attacks; others were seeking revenge for murdered family members; others were conscripted by force.

<P>

<P>The demobilization followed a groundbreaking agreement with the senior rebel commander, Salve Kiir, which was brokered last fall by UNICEF's New York-based director, Carol Bellamy.

<P>

<P>Under the agreement, UNICEF would take the boys from army barracks in northern Bahr el Ghazal, a dangerous and volatile area prone to attack by government forces, and would send them to ''transit camps'' far behind the front lines.

<P>

<P>There they would start classes and receive treatment for the mental and physical scars of army life while UNICEF located their parents or surviving relatives. Then they would be sent home.

<P>

<P>Problems quickly surfaced after February's well-publicized demobilization. UNICEF did not screen the young soldiers before flying them out, so at least 1,000 more boys than planned were brought to the camps. The extra numbers put a strain on resources.

<P>

<P>In the largest camp, Akot, where 1,500 boys had been squeezed into a space intended for 600, sanitary facilities were nonexistent, and many boys had to sleep outdoors. Food ran short, and promised classes were temporarily stopped. Brawls broke out among youngsters from rival villages; on one occasion adult soldiers were called in to quell the violence.

<P>

<P>In other camps, boys walked to the UNICEF headquarters in Rumbek to mount protests at the gates. ''The kawja [white men] told us we would have sleeping materials, books for teaching, and clothes. But these things have not appeared,'' said one young soldier, Peter Wol. He gave his age as 18, which in theory should have disqualified him from the demobilization.

<P>

<P>UNICEF now says that may of the problems at Akot have been cleared up. Sanitary facilities are being provided, classes have restarted, and ''not one child has gone hungry,'' said a UNICEF spokesman, Martin Dawes. He stressed that Akot was not representative of all of the camps.

<P>

<P>The UNICEF began its initiative in early February when Sapra received military intelligence that a massive government offensive was looming. If there was fighting, the child soldiers would almost certainly get caught up in it, he reasoned. They had to get out.

<P>

<P>Transit camps were hastily organized around the relatively safe town of Rumbek, about 200 miles to the south. Conditions were basic; in some camps, latrines had not been dug. But Sapra felt it was a question of life or death. ''Given enough time we could have provided beautiful facilities,''  he said. ''But hundreds, maybe thousands, of kids would have died.''

<P>

<P>Other aid workers have since questioned that assumption, particularly as the feared offensive did not materialize. Ann O'Mahony is the Sudan director for Concern, an Irish aid agency working in Marial Bai, a town from which many of the boys were taken.

<P>

<P>''Relatively few of them were involved in active combat. Most stayed in the barracks, cleaning the soldiers' boots, cooking, or acting as porters,'' she said. ''If there was an attack I think they would be at the same risk as the rest of the population.''

<P>

<P>During the demobilization, Concern staff members reported that ''a good number'' of boys were not child soldiers but had been sent to Rumbek by their parents. 

<P>

<P>''They believed they were being sent to boarding schools,''

<P>

<P>O'Mahony said. 

<P>

<P>A subsequent UNICEF survey found that 9 percent were ''fake'' child soldiers, although other aid workers in Rumbek privately estimate the real figure could be as much as three times higher.

<P>

<P>UNICEF says it had anticipated a maximum rate of 20 percent. 

<P>

<P>A few weeks into the project, other aid agencies working in Sudan wrote a joint letter to UNICEF expressing ''great concern'' about the management of the project. But many of those worries have now been assuaged, and partners such as Save the Children-UK are working with UNICEF to rehabilitate the child soliders.

<P>

<P>But some aid workers are still unhappy. Evar Stromsmo, a community development manager with the charity Norwegian People's Aid, visited Akot recently. The camp was ''disorganized and sad,'' he said.

<P>

<P>''It's a very unfortunate situation. At the end of the day, both UNICEF and the SPLA are looking bad,'' he said.

<P>

<P>Now, UNICEF is preparing to send the boys back to their families. But a thorny issue has arisen: Should children be sent back to dangerous areas prone to government attack?

<P>

<P>Wendy Fenton of Save the Children-UK visited the camps around Rumbek. She said: ''The boys tell us, `You moved us out because of insecurity and now you're telling us to go back. But what has changed?'''
