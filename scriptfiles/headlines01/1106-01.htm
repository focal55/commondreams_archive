ROME - The United Nations <a href="http://www.fao.org/Default.htm" target="_new">Food and Agriculture

Organization</a> (FAO) Conference has approved an international treaty

that largely bans the patenting of non-genetically modified crops,

a step aimed at protecting plant diversity as a tool for

eradicating world hunger. 

<P>

   The International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food

and Agriculture is intended to preserve the diversity of food and

agriculture and the ''fair and equitable sharing of the

benefits.'' 

<P>

   The treaty was finalized at the biennial conference of the FAO,

under way in the Italian capital and ending Nov 13, with 116 votes

in favor, two abstentions, and no votes against. 

<P>

   The accord, the result of seven years of contentious

multilateral negotiations pitting environmentalists and poor

countries against transnational corporations and the

industrialized North, will foment the sustainable preservation of

all plant genetic resources by the FAO member countries. 

<P>

   FAO director-general Jacques Diouf called the treaty approved

Sunday an ''historic event'' and a ''milestone in international

cooperation. It is the successful outcome of lengthy negotiations

which started in November 1994 among FAO's member states,'' which

now number 183 after four new countries were admitted last Friday. 

<P>

   The treaty ''is at the crossroads where agriculture,

environment and trade meet. It is a major international instrument

reflecting the significance of access and benefit sharing as the

bases for continued and sustainable utilization of plant genetic

resources,'' stated Diouf. 

<P>

   Fernando Gerbasi, chairman of the FAO Commission on Genetic

Resources for Food and Agriculture, in a conversation with IPS,

explained that 90 percent of plant genetic resources are freely

accessible, ''and one could not apply for intellectual property

rights over them.'' 

<P>

   Until now, ''it was permitted to patent genetic resources that

had not been modified in any way,'' said the Venezuelan diplomat. 

<P>

   The treaty therefore fills a void, which is crucial for global

food security, not only for current generations, but even more so

for future generations because it ensures the sustainable use of

genetic resources, he said. 

<P>

   Plant breeders developing new crop varieties and seeking

intellectual property rights over them will have to contribute to

a fund that will finance programs for agricultural improvement,

conservation, development and training in poor countries, said

Gerbasi. 

<P>

   The secretary of the Commission on Genetic Resources, José

Esquinas-Alcázar, said that despite the approval of the treaty,

''an enormous task still lies ahead to implement the provisions of

the treaty,'' given the great erosion of genetic resources for

food and agriculture. 

<P>

   Among these challenges, he stressed the ''need to ensure that

the genetic resources and local technologies developed by

generations of farmers are complemented and enhanced by the new

genetic technologies, and not threatened or replaced by them.'' 

<P>

   Traditional and modern technologies alike must be developed in

service of humanity, particularly to eradicate hunger and to

promote sustainable development in the South, where more than 800

million people continue to suffer malnutrition, said Esquinas-

Alcázar. 

<P>

   The principal aim of the treaty is to speed up agricultural

research, especially efforts towards ensuring that small farmers

have access to greater agricultural resources, said Josep Garí, an

adviser to the FAO Commission on Genetic Resources. 

<P>

   The international treaty establishes that patent rights on

agricultural resources may only be obtained for those that are the

outcome of research that results in true genetic modifications. 

<P>

   Nobody will be able to obtain intellectual property rights on

naturally occurring resources that are available, without

restrictions, to those who seek to use them, said Garí. 

<P>

   This is one attempt to put an end to what has been dubbed ''bio-

piracy'' of plant and genetic resources in the countries of the

developing South, as practiced by some multinational companies. 

<P>

   Over the last 10 years, for example, the US-based chemical giant

DuPont has filed approximately 150 applications for patents on

genetic resources with the European Patent Office. 

<P>

   The new international accord, which will be legally binding in

the countries that ratify it, will enter into force when the

parliaments of at least 40 of the signatory states do so. 

<P>

   Italian activist Antonio Onorati, head of a network of

environment-related non-governmental organizations, said the

treaty leaves many unanswered questions as far as private property

rights over genetic resources, which must be resolved as soon as

possible. 

<P>

   The future outcomes of the treaty will depend to great extent

on the negotiating power of small farmers, he said. 

<P>

   But he acknowledged that the international agreement is a step

in the right direction because previous laws aimed at protecting

small farmers did not go nearly this far.
