BOGOTA  - Around 5,000 peasant farmers in Colombia

who returned to their land after being displaced by the decades-

old civil war are asking the government for protection from the

continuing harassment by right-wing paramilitaries and leftist

rebels. 

<P>

   The so-called peace communities set up in the western

department of Chocó, on the border with Panama, are urging

authorities to help them avoid having to once again flee their

communities, as they did back in 1997. <P>

   Since early this year, the leftist Armed Revolutionary Forces

of Colombia (FARC), the main guerrilla group, has been attempting

to move into the area where the peace communities are located. 

<P>

   In the meantime, the paramilitary umbrella, the United Self-

Defense Forces of Colombia (AUC), is trying to maintain control

over the Atrato River, along which the peace communities were set

up, in order to keep the insurgents from using the river as a

supply route. 

<P>

   The rules governing the peace communities, which emerged out of

an agreement with the government, prohibit members from

participating in the war in any way, and from giving information

or supplies to any of the armed factions, including the army.

However, neither the FARC nor the AUC have respected their

neutrality. <P>

   The irregular armed groups ``kill members of our communities''

and do not allow them to move around freely, a leader of one of

the peace communities, who came to Bogota to knock on the doors of

the government, told IPS. He also complained that the residents

were subjected to thorough searches at army checkpoints. <P>

   The delegate asked not to be identified, because that could

cost him his life. ``Our situation is very difficult: we are

caught between a rock and a hard place. You live in a state of

nerves day and night, because you could be killed at any time.'' <P>

   In recent months, the FARC has allegedly killed 18 members of

the peace communities, while the paramilitaries purportedly

murdered 21. Three others are still missing (one reportedly at the

hands of the FARC). <P>

   ``In good faith, we have lived up to our commitment and our

decision not to get involved with the armed groups. But the armed

factions force us into things,'' said another member of the peace

communities. ``They ask us for water. We tell them we cannot give

them any - but we are staring down the barrel of a gun, which

tells us `hand it over or die'.'' <P>

   The two delegates were in the capital to demand that the

government fulfill the terms of the accord that paved the way for

the farmers to return to their land. In the agreement, the

government pledged to protect the peace communities and provide

security, as well as a stronger presence of civilian authorities

in the area, in order to guarantee development and social

investment. <P>

   ``We don't want to be displaced again, or to become `the

forgotten ones' of Colombia,'' one of the representatives of the

peace communities added. <P>

   More than 10,000 small farmers, most of them from black

communities in the strategically located, biologically rich

municipalities of Riosucio and Carmen del Darién, were forced by

the violence to abandon their lands four years ago. <P>

   Some took refuge in the banana-export port city of Turbon or

the town of Pavarandó in the department of Antioquia. Others

crossed the border into Panama. <P>

   In October of that year, 5,000 displaced persons who had fled

to Pavarandó decided to return to their land in the department of

Chocó, where they set up the San Francisco de Asís, Natividad de

María and Nuestra Señora del Carmen peace communities, to try to

piece together their lives in the midst of the conflict. <P>

   The risks faced by the peace communities are very serious, said

Catholic priest Alejando Angulo, the director of the Jesuit-run

Centre for Popular Research (CINEP), which has been providing

support for the returning peasant farmers. <P>

   ``The dispute over that territory is very intense, and these

unarmed communities are exposed to the risk of forced or voluntary

displacement,'' Angulo told IPS. <P>

   ``They have no chance of enduring,'' he added. 

<P>

   Organized in large groups, they are trying - ``on their own

initiative, and at their own risk'' - to engage in dialogue with

the various armed factions, said the priest. 

<P>

   As Angulo sees it, a ``certain level of indifference'' by the

state to the serious problems faced by the peace communities has

compounded the army's inability to respond simultaneously at every

point where local communities are facing threats. <P>

   In short, the situation is a consequence of ``the weakness of

the state,'' he maintained. <P>

   Members of CINEP have also felt the pressure of armed groups in

the Atrato River area, although ``not with the same frequency nor

with the same severity with which the population is treated,''

said Angulo. ''We are identified as part of the Church, which wins

us some respect.'' <P>

   In May, President Andrés Pastrana visited the peace

communities, where he delivered collective title deeds, making

them the formal owners of the land. But the lack of security has

not allowed the farmers to get out and work their property. <P>

   ``We are calling on the state to give us the security we need

to work our land; we are frustrated by the lack of security. The

president handed us our land titles, and 15 days later [the armed

groups] began to violently force us off our property,'' said the

delegates visiting Bogota. <P>

   The two men said members of the paramilitary groups were

forcing them off their property in order to implement their own

agribusiness project: to plant 40,000 hectares of African palm

trees. ``The government must clearly define who the land belongs

to. Is it ours? Or who are we taking care of it for?'' they

wondered. <P>

   ``We have issued a call for the international community to show

solidarity with our efforts, and to exert pressure on the

Colombian state to clearly commit itself to protecting our

rights,'' said the peasant farmers, who explained that they had

sent a letter to United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights

Mary Robinson.</p>
