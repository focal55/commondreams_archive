UNITED NATIONS   - The United States will stay away

from a U.N. conference opening on Sunday to promote a global

ban on nuclear weapons tests, a senior State Department

official said on Friday.

<p>``We will not attend the conference,'' said the official, who

asked not to be named. He did not elaborate on the reasons.

<p>The aim of the conference is to review progress toward

ratification of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT), which

would ban all nuclear blasts, whether in the atmosphere, in

space or underground.

<p>The Pentagon, hoping to hasten the treaty's death, has been

pressing the administration for months to sit out the meeting,

which initially was scheduled for late September but postponed

after the Sept. 11 suicide airliner attacks on New York and

Washington.

<p>The CTBT has not yet entered into force because it has not

garnered the necessary ratifications. It expands on a 1963

treaty barring tests in the atmosphere and a 1974 treaty

setting limits on underground explosions.

<p>The George W. Bush administration worries that without

testing, it cannot ensure the safety and reliability of U.S.

nuclear arms. Critics say simulated testing conducted via

computers and other technology is sufficient.

<p>U.S. officials insist Bush remains deeply concerned about

nuclear proliferation and expects to continue abiding by a

testing moratorium put in place by his father in 1992.

<p>But critics say a boycott of the U.N. conference will be a

powerful message to allies strongly backing the CTBT that

Washington wanted to go it alone on nuclear arms control.

<p>WASHINGTON WAS STRONG BACKER

<p>``This will not be the last word. But it's a sad commentary

on the Bush administration's approach to post-September 11

weapons-of-mass-destruction challenges,'' said Daryl Kimball,

executive director of the Washington-based Arms Control

Association.

<p>``Just as we cannot fight global terror alone, we cannot

alone fight the proliferation of nuclear, chemical and

biological weapons,'' he told Reuters.

<p>Some 79 other nations have signed up to deliver speeches at

the three-day CTBT event, but organizers said earlier on Friday

they had not yet heard from Washington.

<p>The United States was for years a strong backer of the

CTBT, which was 40 years in the making. The pact was approved

by the 189-nation U.N. General Assembly and opened for

signature five years ago.

<p>Under unusual approval procedures, the treaty cannot enter

into force until it is signed and ratified by 44 states --

including the United States -- deemed nuclear arms-capable.

<p>To date, 31 of those 44 countries including avowed nuclear

powers France, Russia and Britain have signed and ratified the

pact. So 13 more must ratify before it can take hold.

<p>In that group, India, Pakistan and North Korea have neither

signed nor ratified the treaty while the United States, China

and eight others have signed but not ratified.

<p>Former President Bill Clinton was the first world leader to

sign the accord, in 1996. But the Senate refused to ratify it

in the partisan-charged run-up to the 2000 election.

<p>Jayantha Dhanapala, the top U.N. disarmament official, said

nuclear rivals India and Pakistan have said they will sign the

pact but still have not done so. No signings or ratifications

are expected to be announced during the U.N. conference, he

said.

<p>The meeting is to end in adoption of a declaration expected

to call on nations that have not yet signed or ratified to do

so as soon as possible.
