MEXICO CITY  - Governments in 45 countries
across the
developing world are being taken to task for placing restrictions
on their
citizens' ability to access information on the internet. 
<P>
In most cases, government control has been achieved by compelling
citizens to
subscribe to a state-run Internet Service Provider (ISP), charges
Reporters
Without Borders (known by its French acronym RSF, for Reporters
Sans
Frontiers). <P>
Some governments, on the other hand, have imposed restrictions by
installing
filters blocking access to web sites regarded as ''unsuitable''
and sometimes
forcing internet users to register with state authorities, adds
this
Paris-based media rights monitor in a new study, 'The Enemies of
the
Internet'. <P>

</TABLE></font>For RSF, furthermore, 20 of the 45 countries surveyed in its study
may be
described as the ''real enemies'' of this new means of
communication, given
the
extent of infringements that prevail. <P>
''On the pretext of protecting the public from 'subversive ideas'
or defending
'national security and unity,' some governments totally prevent
their citizens
from gaining access to the internet,'' it points out. 
<P>
Included in this list of ''real enemies'' are nations such as
Belarus, Burma,
China, Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Saudi Arabia, Sierra
Leone,
Sudan,
Syria, Tunisia and Vietnam. <P>
Also identified are countries of Central Asia and the Caucasus,
like
Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Kirghizia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and
Uzbekistan. <P>
In the case of Saudi Arabia, for instance, despite the presence of
37 private
companies permitted to operate as ISPs, ''all traffic at the
moment goes
through the servers of the Science and Technology Centre, a public
body, which
is equipped with filters banning access to sites that provide
'information
contrary to Islamic values','' says RSF. <P>
In that Arab nation, furthermore, the internet has been officially
regarded as
''a harmful force for westernising people's minds''. <P>
Regards Cuba, on the other hand, the government controls the
internet in the
same way it does for the other media, the study reveals. ''There
is no free
expression in Cuba at the national level.'' <P>
While in China, despite the rapid spread of the internet, the
government
continues to ''keep up pressure'' on users. ''In order to prevent
the Chinese
from finding information on the web, the authorities have blocked
access to
some sites,'' notes the study. <P>
Evidence RSF gathered from countries like Burma and Sierra Leone
point to
other
impediments to the internet culture, too. In Burma, a law passed
in September
1996 obliges anyone who owns a computer to declare it to the
government.
''Those who fail to comply may face up to 15 years in prison.'' <P>
And in Sierra Leone, the authorities have attacked journalists
working for an
online newspaper. <P>
Its findings also expose the consequences of such interference
with access to
the information superhighway. For medical students in Iran, where
censorship of
the internet is identical to that affecting other media, it has
meant being
denied access to web sites that deal with anatomy. <P>
For RSF, such efforts at censorship go against the grain of
Article 19 of the
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which states
that
everyone shall have the right to receive and impart information
and ideas of
all kinds, regardless of the frontiers. <P>
Moreover, it adds, 14 of the countries where such censorship
occurs have
signed
this international covenant to uphold the rights spelled out in
it. These
countries, declares RSF, need to ''respect the undertakings they
made''. <P>
The restrictions have posed a dilemma for some of the 45 countries
listed by
RSF. That stems from the economic potential of the internet, as a
catalyst for
growth and development. <P>
''The internet is a two-edged sword for authoritarian regimes,''
remarks RSF.
On the one hand, ''it enables any citizen to enjoy an
unprecedented degree of
freedom of speech and therefore constitutes a threat to the
government. <P>
''On the other hand, however, the internet is a major factor in
economic
growth, due in particular to online trade and the exchange of
technical and
scientific information, which prompts some of these governments to
promote its
spread,'' it adds. <P>
This dilemma, in fact, comes to light in two East Asian countries
Malaysia
and
Singapore. According to RSF, ''The economic argument seems to be
winning the
day in countries such as Malaysia and Singapore, where controlling
'dangerous'
sites is proving difficult for the authorities.'' <P>
Moreover, it also affirms that the efforts by governments to block
wide access
to the internet is being chipped away in some countries by
ingenious web
users.
''Web surfers can find ways round censorship: encoding, going
through servers
that offer anonymity when consulting banned sites or sending e-
mails,
connecting via cellphones and so on.'' <P>
But such measures need not be taken if access to the information
superhighway
is open and free. And to achieve that in the 20 countries with
severe
restrictions, RSF has called on the governments in question to
implement
change. <P>
Among RSF's recommendations are: the abolition of state monopoly
on internet
access, a stop to the control of ISPs, the cancellation of the
obligation for
citizens to register with the government for internet access, a
stop to
censorship through use of filters, and an end to legal proceedings
against
internet users.
