WASHINGTON   - The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Agency

said on Thursday that it would give potassium iodide to states

that want to stockpile the medicine in case of an attack

against a nuclear power plant.

<p>The drug has been shown to protect the body's thyroid gland

if taken soon after radiation exposure.

<p>Rep. Edward Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat who has long

criticized what he terms inadequate safety provisions at

nuclear power plants, is among several lawmakers who have urged

stricter security measures at the plants since the deadly Sept.

11 attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.

<p>Nuclear plants, which rank among the nation's most closely

guarded facilities, are of particular concern because an attack

could spew radioactive contamination over an area covering

hundreds of square miles.

<p>The regulatory commission said it had earmarked $800,000 to

buy potassium iodide supplies for people living within about 10

miles of a nuclear plant. The United States has 103 nuclear

power plants.

<p>``The commission has found that potassium iodide is a

reasonable, prudent and inexpensive supplement to evacuation

and sheltering for specific local conditions,'' a statement

said.

<p>The drug will be given to states that request it within 30

days, according to the commission.

<p>Alabama, Arizona and Tennessee already have potassium

iodide stockpiled for people living near nuclear plants as part

of emergency preparedness programs.

<p>The agency took the action a month after Markey urged the

federal government to stock the drug at homes and public

buildings within 50 miles of a nuclear plant.

<p>The <a href="http://www.nci.org" target="_new">Nuclear Control Institute</a>, an activist group, said a

direct, high-speed crash by a large passenger jet would likely

penetrate the concrete walls of up to 4-1/2 feet that protect a

nuclear plant's reactor.

<p>Separately, Congress approved an extra $36 million in

funding for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission so it could

assess security at nuclear power plants.

<p>The funds were included in a $20 billion supplemental

spending bill for the Defense Department that was agreed on by

House and Senate negotiators. The agency will study the safety

design of nuclear plants security in the transportation,

storage and use of nuclear materials.</p>
