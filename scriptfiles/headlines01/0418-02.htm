RIO DE JANEIRO  - Demonstrators in dozens of cities

throughout Brazil and around the world marked International Day of

Farmers' Struggle on Tuesday, protesting police massacres of rural

workers, genetically modified seeds, and agricultural trade that

jeopardises food security. 

<P>

   In one major mobilisation, some 2,000 landless peasants and

small farmers blocked the international bridge in the border city

of Uruguaiana, in southern Brazil, to halt imports of farm

products from Argentina. <P>

</table></font>Brazilian farmers are forced to sell their maize at prices 25

percent less than production costs, or they have to store it,

because of the heavy volume of the same grain imported during the

local harvest season, complained the protesters, who say they

intend to hold the bridge for three days. <P>

   In Carazinho, 450 km northeast of Uruguaiana, another thousand

people - mobilised by the powerful Movimento dos Sem Terra (MST -

landless workers' movement) - gathered outside a dairy processing

plant of the Italian transnational Parmalat, preventing the firm's

administrators from entering the site. <P>

   MST targeted Parmalat as one of the corporations favoured by

the Brazilian government's agricultural policy.  <P>

   One demonstrator explained that a dairy farmer in southern

Brazil today receives 20 percent less per litre of milk produced

than in 1994, while the price has more than doubled for consumers. <P>

   Parmalat and its Swiss counterpart, Nestlé, pay just 15 cents

on the dollar for every litre of milk produced in the developing

South, compared to the 48 cents per litre paid to European

farmers, but their prices are nearly the same in supermarkets

everywhere, pointed out Joao Pedro Stédile, an MST leader. <P>

   The protests on this ''day of the farmer'' aim to denounce

cheap food imports, which hurt the domestic agricultural sector,

to defend sovereign policies on food security and to condemn

agricultural commerce regulated by the World Trade Organisation

(WTO). <P>

   The peasant farmers and rural workers want to abolish the WTO

rules that, for example, force developing countries to import up

to five percent of their domestic consumption of agricultural

products. <P>

   Farm production destined for export, a dynamic required by the

globalisation process and adopted by the Brazilian government,

''only benefits the big producers'' and harms small farmers and

agrarian reform, charged Gilmar Mauro, another MST leader, as he

led protests in Sao Paulo. <P>

   Protesters threw rocks, eggs and tomatoes at a McDonald's

restaurant - another symbol of the neoliberal globalisation

process - in Campo Grande, a capital in Brazil's central-west,

where an estimated 3,000 activists gathered, including rural

workers from neighbouring Paraguay. <P>

   MST reports indicate that peasant farmers and rural workers in

dozens of countries took part in demonstrations Tuesday promoted

by 'Vía Campesina,' a movement founded in 1993 that unites more

than 80 peasant and farm organisations. <P>

   In Europe, protests focussed on genetically modified seeds, but

also served to express solidarity with agrarian reform movements

in developing countries and to condemn violence against peasant

farmers.  <P>

   April 17 was chosen as International Day of Farmers' Struggle

because it was on this date in 1996 that police assassinated 19

landless rural workers during a protest in Eldorado do Carajás, in

northern Brazil. <P>

   Of the 19 victims, 13 were killed with hatchets and scythes

after having their hands tied, according to the MST, which

organised that fateful march.  <P>

   Now, five years later, peasant protests throughout the state of

Pará, where Eldorado do Carajás is located, condemned the fact

that not one of the 154 military police who participated in the

massacre has been brought to justice. <P>

   One case did reach the courts in 1999, absolving the three

commanders of the operation, but the trial was annulled due to a

series of irregularities in the proceedings. <P>

   Landless peasants in southern Brazil, who have lived in

encampments for the last several years as they await the

implementation of agrarian reforms, blocked numerous roads for 19

minutes - to commemorate the 19 people killed in Eldorado do

Carajás. <P>

   The protests throughout the country were mostly peaceful, and

did not involve the takeover of government offices, as officials

had feared. In some states, such as Mato Grosso do Sul,

demonstrations in the cities were preceded by weeks-long marches

through rural areas and smaller towns. <P>

   The impact of this ''day of the farmer'' on the international

arena was quite limited, despite the numerous events in Brazil,

and indicates that turning April 17 into a date as powerful as May

Day (International Labour Day), or March 8 (International Women's

Day), will require a great deal of mobilisation and coordination

of the rural workers' movements around the world. <P>

   It is a date created 110 years after International Labour Day -

a tribute to industrial workers - and is intended as a response to

the neoliberal globalisation process that threatens to eliminate

small farm production, according to organisers. <P>

   But the efforts to consolidate April 17 as International Day of

Farmers' Struggle occur at a time when the world's rural

population has been greatly reduced, except in some areas of Asia

and Africa.
