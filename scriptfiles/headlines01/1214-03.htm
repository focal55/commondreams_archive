UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - U.N. Secretary-General Kofi

Annan  regretted on Friday Washington's decision to abandon the

1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, fearing it could spark an

arms race.

<p>``The ABM treaty has served for many years as a cornerstone

for maintaining global peace and security and strategic

stability,'' U.N. spokesman Manoel de Almeida e Silva said.

<p>Annan, he said, was concerned that abandoning the treaty

would ``provoke an arms race, especially in the missile area,

and further undermine disarmament and nonproliferation

regimes.''

<p>The secretary-general called on all countries to explore

''new binding and irreversible initiatives to avert such

unwelcome effects,'' Almeida e Silva said.''

<p>``The ABM treaty has served for many years as a cornerstone

for maintaining global peace and security and strategic

stability,'' he said. Annan had ``noted with regret'' the U.S.

decision.

<p>Rejecting Russian and Chinese opposition, President Bush gave formal notice on Thursday that the United States was

abandoning the treaty in order to press ahead with a missile

defense system.

<p>The decision marked the first time in recent history that

the United States has withdrawn from a major international arms

treaty. The ABM expressly forbids deployment of missile

defenses.
