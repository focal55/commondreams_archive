WASHINGTON  - Acting within 24 hours of the House of

Representatives, the U.S. Senate approved Thursday sweeping anti-

terrorism legislation that civil liberties groups said could

violate the Constitution and basic rights.

<P>

The <a href="http://www.senate.gov/legislative/vote1071/vote_00313.html" target="_new">98-1 vote</a> <i>(Voting nay - Russ Feingold (D-WI) ) </i>came amid growing concern about anthrax attacks

against lawmakers and other Washington officials through the mail.

The House passed the same measure by <a href="http://clerkweb.house.gov/cgi-bin/vote.exe?year=2001&rollnumber=398" target="_new">357-66</a> Wednesday. 

<P>

President George W. Bush, who has pressed Congress over the last

two weeks to take swift action, is expected to sign the package

into law Friday. 

<P>

Bush got virtually all but the most draconian measures he had

included in the anti-terrorism bill, which he submitted to

Congress in the aftermath of Sep. 11 terrorist attacks on New York

and the Pentagon. 

<P>

The bill greatly expands federal agencies' authority to conduct

surveillance and wiretapping operations and secret searches

against terrorist suspects while reducing judicial oversight. 

<P>

The bill also imposes much stronger penalties on those who harbor

or finance terrorists and greatly reduces the due-process rights

and recourse to judicial review of immigrants suspected of

terrorism. For example, suspect immigrants could be held for up to

seven days before being allowed to appeal to a judge. 

<P>

Other controversial measures include giving the Central

Intelligence Agency (CIA) director authority to identify priority

targets for intelligence surveillance within the United States, a

function from which the CIA previously was barred, and broadening

the definition of ''domestic terrorism'' in a way that could

subject people engaged in political protest to wiretapping and

even criminal prosecution. 

<P>

The package also greatly strengthens existing laws against money

laundering and adds terrorism, fraud, corruption, and smuggling to

the list of offenses subject to federal money-laundering laws. 

<P>

Passage of the new law, which follows five weeks of intense debate

and negotiation, comes as other countries take similar action in

the wake of last month's attacks. 

<P>

The governments of Canada and India, for example, have tabled far-

reaching measures that international and local human rights and

civil liberties groups, including <a href="http://www.amnesty.org" target="_new">Amnesty International</a> and <a href="http://www.hrw.org" target="_new">Human

Rights Watch</a> (HRW), have warned will expand the powers of the

state at the expense of judicial oversight and key democratic

freedoms. The European Union (EU) also is considering legislation

that could greatly reduce the rights of immigrants, in particular. 

<P>

The groups also have voiced strong concerns about the U.S.

legislation, particularly as regards its effects on non-citizens.

HRW and the New York-based <a href="http://www.lchr.org/" target="_new">Lawyers Committee for Human Rights</a>

(LCHR) have argued that the bill effectively permits the Justice

Department to detain non-citizens indefinitely if they cannot be

deported and so long as it believes the suspect represents a

threat to national security. 

<P>

''Non-citizens no less than citizens have a right to freedom from

arbitrary or indefinite administrative detention,'' said HRW

director Kenneth Roth. ''As the U.S. defends itself from

terrorism, it must also strengthen its defense of the freedoms

that are the hallmark of the country.'' 

<P>

Even without the new bill, civil liberties groups have grown

increasingly concerned about the continued detention by federal

authorities of almost one thousand people - almost all non-citizen

Muslims - in connection with the Sep. 11 attacks. Most are being

held either as ''material witnesses'' or on minor immigration

offenses. 

<P>

On Wednesday, Amnesty voiced concern about the punitive conditions

under which many of these people were being held and questioned

whether their rights to legal representation and full due process

were being fully respected. One of the detainees, a Pakistani who

had overstayed his visa, died of an apparent heart ailment in jail

earlier this week after being held for more than a month. 

<P>

''It just underscores our concern that there needs to be more

openness and transparency about this process,'' said Jeanne

Butterfield, head of the <a href="http://www.aila.org/main.html" target="_new">American Immigration Lawyers Association</a>.

''We've been clamoring for information about who is being

detained and do they have access to counsel. But I can't get

anything.'' 

<P>

Many of the more controversial provisions of the new law,

particularly those affecting immigrants' rights, are expected to

be challenged in the courts, according to Nancy Chang, a senior

attorney with the <a href="http://www.humanrightsnow.org/">Center for Constitutional Rights</a> (CCR). 

<P>

''As constitutional challenges to the legislation wind their way

through the courts, the judiciary will be presented with the

choice of upholding the Constitution or acquiescing in its

surrender,'' she said. 

<P>

One plaintiff is certain to be the <a href="http://www.aclu.org" target="_new">American Civil Liberties Union</a>

(ACLU), which expressed ''deep disappointment'' both with the

content of the legislation and the way it was moved through

Congress. 

<P>

Noting that the final version of the bill, which replaced another

version that emerged from protracted negotiations between

Republicans and Democrats in the House, was sent to the floor at a

time when House offices were closed off due to the anthrax scare,

it described the expedited vote as ''deeply flawed and an offense

to the thoughtful legislative process necessary to protect the

Constitution and the Bill of Rights.'' 

<P>

Still, lawmakers with strong civil liberties records who voted for

the bill said they had extracted important concessions from the

administration, which had originally requested, for example, that

immigrant suspects be detained indefinitely without any judicial

review. 

<P>

In addition, they succeeded in imposing a ''sunset clause'' on

many of the more controversial measures extending the surveillance

powers of the federal government. While the administration had

asked that these powers be made permanent, under the bill passed

Thursday, they will expire after four years unless Congress votes

to extend them. 

<P>

''In provision after provision, we added safeguards that were

missing from the administration's plan,'' declared Senator Patrick

Leahy, the Judiciary Committee chairman. ''We have done our utmost

to protect Americans against abuse of these new law enforcement

tools.''
