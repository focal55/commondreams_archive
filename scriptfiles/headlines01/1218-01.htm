The FBI is planning to give away computer software. All you have to do to get some is make the bureau think you're involved in crime.

<P>

 The software is called Magic Lantern, and along with the Justice Department's greatly expanded powers, it's making civil libertarians nervous.

<P>

 Magic Lantern is a program that records each keystroke made on a target computer and transmits that data to the bureau. The FBI doesn't even have to go to the computer's location because Magic Lantern can install itself, just like a Trojan-horse computer virus. And like a Trojan horse, it disguises itself as a benign code.

<P>

 The FBI has acknowledged Magic Lantern's existence but little more. The program is intended to sidestep one of the most difficult eavesdropping hurdles: encryption.

<P>

 Encrypted e-mail is almost impossible to decipher without a key, a small computer file that unscrambles the code. Without the key, encrypted e-mail is gibberish. The key, in turn, is protected by a password.

<P>

 Magic Lantern apparently doesn't try to decrypt e-mail. Instead, it records the characters as they're typed. With it, the bureau can obtain a suspect's password and then the encryption key.

<P>

 Encrypted e-mail has bedeviled the FBI for years.

<P>

 Its first attempt to get around the problem was a device that recorded keystrokes, called a key logger. But unlike Magic Lantern, the device required an agent to sneak into a suspect's home or office to install it on a computer.

<P>

 While few people argue that such devices can be invaluable in national-security cases, some contend that their use in other types of cases is inevitable.

<P>

 In fact, evidence developed with a keystroke-logging device already has been used in the trial of suspected Philadelphia mobster Nicodemo Scarfo.

<P>

 The recently passed USA Patriot Act gives the Justice Department much more freedom to record e-mail information. One provision can force a judge to issue an order for recording the addresses to which a suspect sends messages and from which the suspect gets messages &#151; if a prosecutor files papers certifying that e-mail is relevant to an investigation.

<P>

 Privacy advocates argue the law is far too open to interpretation.

<P>

"What is relevant?" asked David Sobel, general counsel to the Electronic Privacy Information Center in Washington. "Anything could be relevant."
