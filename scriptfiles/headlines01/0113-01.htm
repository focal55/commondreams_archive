            George W Bush's nominee to be the next US attorney general has been 

            linked to an extremist pro-gun lobbying group which believes that 

            the answer to America's school shootings is to allow pupils to be 

            armed in the classroom. 

            <P>The revelation that former senator John Ashcroft has recent links 

              with the militant Gun Owners of America (GOA) group is the latest 

              twist in an increasingly impassioned partisan battle over a nomination 

              which has become a major trial of political strength for Mr Bush. 

            <P>Even many conservatives consider the GOA to be extremist. After 

              a shooting at an Oregon school in May 1998 in which two pupils were 

              killed by a fellow student, it issued a press release headed: "Lesson 

              of school shootings: More guns needed at schools". 

            <P>Its director, Larry Pratt, was forced to resign as co-chairman 

              of Pat Buchanan's 1996 presidential bid after news leaked of his 

              links with the Ku Klux Klan, the Aryan Nations and rightwing militia 

              groups. Mr Pratt is also head of an anti-immigrant organisation 

              called English First. 

            <P>It emerged yesterday that Mr Ashcroft wrote a friendly handwritten 

              letter in March 1998 to Mr Pratt, thanking him for drawing his attention 

              to provisions in a juvenile justice bill which imposed increased 

              penalties for gun law offences. As a result of the GOA's lobbying, 

              Mr Ashcroft, who had originally been a sponsor of the bill, withdrew 

              his support for the legislation. 

            <P>The letter was sent on Senate notepaper and was addressed "Dear 

              Larry" and signed "Thanks! John". 

            <P>This is not the only known link between Mr Ashcroft and Mr Pratt. 

              The two men know each another from a secretive but highly influential 

              rightwing religious group called the Council for National Policy, 

              of which Mr Pratt is a member and whose meetings Mr Ashcroft has 

              attended. The CNP's membership is almost a who's who of US conservatism 

              and includes the Republican congressional leaders Senator Trent 

              Lott and Congressman Tom DeLay. 

            <P>The revelation of the link with Mr Pratt came as two other allegations 

              about Mr Ashcroft's extreme rightwing links also surfaced. 

            <P>In the first, it was confirmed that Mr Ashcroft took time off from 

              his bitter senatorial contest last September to meet Thomas Bugel, 

              the president of the St Louis chapter of the Council of Conservative 

              Citizens, to discuss the case of a CCC member, Charles Sell, jailed 

              by federal authorities on charges of conspiring to murder an FBI 

              agent. 

            <P>The CCC is the successor organisation of the Citizens Council, 

              which led the fight against integration in the South in the 1950s 

              and 60s. The CCC, whose supporters also include Senator Lott and 

              Senator Jesse Helms, opposes interracial marriage and non-white 

              immigration, and believes black people are genetically less intelligent 

              than whites. It is currently mobilising to try to defeat a statewide 

              referendum in Mississippi in April to remove the Confederate flag 

              from the state flag. 

            <P>Meanwhile, the ultra-conservative Bob Jones University in South 

              Carolina confirmed that it possessed a transcript of reportedly 

              inflammatory remarks made by Mr Ashcroft in a May 1999 speech there. 

              The Senate judiciary committee, where Mr Ashcroft faces confirmation 

              hearings next week, had asked the university to supply a transcript, 

              after rumours surfaced about the speech. 

            <P>Bob Jones University, whose graduates include the Rev Ian Paisley, 

              was at the centre of a political storm last year when Mr Bush made 

              a speech there to rally conservative support for his presidential 

              bid after he lost the New Hampshire primary to John McCain. The 

              university had a ban on inter-racial dating and supports a doctrinaire 

              anti-Catholic view of the world. 

            <P>Mr Ashcroft's nomination has become the latest flashpoint of America's 

              political culture wars, with both sides preparing for a major confrontation 

              next week. On Thursday, Mr Bush urged Mr Ashcroft's opponents to 

              "tone down their rhetoric". 

            <P>Mr Ashcroft spent yesterday trying to shore up support among moderate 

              Republican senators who support abortion rights, an issue he strongly 

              opposes.
