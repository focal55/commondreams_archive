MUNICH, Germany  - A senior Russian security
official said Sunday U.S. plans to deploy an anti-missile
system would undermine world stability and lead to a new arms
race in outer space.
<p>Speaking at a defense conference in Munich, Sergei Ivanov,
secretary of Russia's security council, offered talks on deep
cuts in strategic nuclear arms if the new administration of
U.S. President George W. Bush  abandons its plans.

</TABLE>``The destruction of the ABM Treaty will result in the
annihilation of the whole structure of strategic stability and
create prerequisites for a new arms race, including one in
outer space,'' Ivanov said.<p>Defense analysts say the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty
between the United States and the then Soviet Union would be
breached by the new U.S. system if it were to come into force.<p>``Restraining the so-called rogue nations -- to use the
American terminology -- may be carried out more effectively
from the point of view of both expense and consequences by
means of a common political effort,'' Ivanov said.
<p>``The situation in North Korea  is the obvious example
because the situation a year ago seemed much worse than today.''
<p>He spoke a day after new Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld,
speaking at Munich, reiterated Washington's intention to
develop a missile shield despite objections from what Ivanov
said was 88 countries, including its European allies.<p>U.S. officials have cited the threat of missile attacks
from nations such as North Korea as a reason to deploy a
defensive shield.<p>Ivanov held out the possibility of substantial arms control
cuts if Washington dropped its missile defense plans and
preserved the ABM Treaty limiting Russia and the United States
to a single defensive missile site each.<p>``If the ABM Treaty is maintained, Russia is ready for
radical cuts with the United States of strategic offensive
weapons to as low as 1,500 and even lower than this level,''
Ivanov told the conference on international security.<p>``We are also ready for an immediate start to official talks
with the United States on SALT 3.''
The alternative was a dangerous arms race into space, Ivanov
said, urging an international conference on preventing the
militarization of outer space.<p>``The problem is very urgent.''
<p><font size=+1><b><font size="3">Russian Abm Site Still Working</font></b></font>
<p>Since 1975, only Russia has maintained an ABM site, which
it deploys around Moscow.<p>``This system is not destabilizing in any way because it is
not a national system. It does not cover the national territory
of Russia but less than one fifth of Russia's territory,''
Ivanov told reporters when asked why Russia still kept an ABM
site.<p>``This is allowed by the 1972 ABM treaty.''<p>American officials say the ABM treaty is an antiquated
relic no longer essential in the post-Cold War world, an
argument Russia rejects.<p>``The treaty created the possibility for predictability in
the nuclear sphere and progress on the way toward nuclear
disarmament not only for the USSR and the United States, but
also the whole world,'' Ivanov said.
<p>The official also said Russia would continue talks with
Europe on President Vladimir Putin's alternative suggestion to
build a pan-European theater missile system including Russia
that could intercept missiles soon after they were fired.
<p>``It's a matter of further investigation, military
cooperation including the exchange of data and technology. It
is, by the way, very expensive,'' Ivanov said. ``We are going to
follow through if our Western partners are willing.''
