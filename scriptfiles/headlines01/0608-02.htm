BOGOTA, Colombia  - Tens of thousands of teachers, state

workers, and students have protested budget reforms mandated in

agreements between Colombia and the International Monetary Fund.

</table></font>Marches in the capital and most major cities Thursday were

largely peaceful. However, hooded youths bashed in windows at some

businesses in Bogota and police and demonstrators were injured when

riot police cleared a blocked highway in the northeastern city of

Bucaramanga.<p>The demonstrators oppose a law moving through Colombia's

congress that would control the growth of federal outlays to states

and municipalities. The law appears near final passage, after which

it must be signed by President Andres Pastrana.<p>About 300,000 teachers and 125,000 public health workers have

been on strike or participating in work slowdowns since last month

to protest the measure, being enacted as part of deficit-cutting

agreed to in return for loans from the IMF.<p>The government has tried to provide assurances that the reforms

will only cut government waste, without affecting jobs or services.

It projects government savings of $4 billion over the next seven

years.<p>On Thursday, police stationed riot units and armored vehicles

with water cannons around the capital, and dispatched helicopters

over the city to deter violence. Bogota banned liquor sales

indefinitely and the carrying of weapons until Monday.<p>Highways were blocked in at least three states, including Norte

de Santander, Cauca and Valle.<p>Gloria Ramirez, the president of the Colombian Federation of

Teachers, said the protests were not only against the controversial

budget cuts but the entire ``neoliberal model'' she said was being

imposed on the country from abroad.
