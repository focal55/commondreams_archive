UNITED NATIONS  - The UN Children's Fund (UNICEF),

along with a

coalition of international non-governmental organisations (NGOs),

has launched

''an unprecedented global campaign'' to improve the lives of

children

worldwide.

<P>

Called 'Say Yes for Children', the campaign is expected to reach

the far

corners of the globe in an attempt to rally people behind 10

overarching

principles that seek to protect children. <P>

The 10 principles are: Leave No Child Out; Put Children First;

Care for Every

Child; Fight HIV/AIDS; Stop Harming and Exploiting Children;

Listen to

Children; Educate Every Child; Protect Children from War; Protect

the Earth

for

Children; and Fight Poverty: Invest in Children. <P>

Countries that have held or are planning launches range from

Angola and Benin

in Africa to Brazil and Chile in Latin America and Bangladesh and

Cambodia in

Asia. <P>

The pledge begins with a simple plea: ''Too many of the world's

children

suffer

the effects of war, poverty, sickness, discrimination or abuse.

This is your

opportunity to send a message to the world's leaders that this is

unacceptable.

This is your opportunity to say Yes to Children.'' <P>

The leaders of the campaign include former South African President

Nelson

Mandela, founder and head of Microsoft, Bill Gates, British

actress and

political activist Vanessa Redgrave and UN Secretary-General Kofi

Annan. The

NGOs participating in the campaign include Save the Children,

World Vision,

Netaid.Org Foundation, PLAN International and the Bangladesh Rural

Advancement

Committee. <P>

Launched simultaneously at UN headquarters in New York and at a

middle school

in London Thursday, the campaign is also seeking to register world

opinion on

issues crucial to children.  

<P>

The pledges, which can be made online

(<http://www.gmfc.org/><a href="http://www.gmfc.org">www.gmfc.org</a>) and

offline will eventually be presented to world leaders who will be

in New York

Sep. 19-21 for the UN Special Session on Children. 

<P>

''The Special Session will indeed be a special moment in history -

a time for

world leaders to commit themselves to specific actions to help the

children of

the world,'' says Annan. <P>

''Say Yes for Children is an opportunity for all of us to show

them the way,

and to give visibility and a voice to the children who need it

most,'' he

notes. <P>

The 10 principles build on the 1989 landmark UN Convention on the

Rights of

the

Child, the most ratified international human treaty ever, and on

the 1990

World

Summit for Children, where 71 world leaders committed themselves

to specific

goals for children and young people. <P>

Ambassador Patricia Durrant of Jamaica, chairperson of the

Preparatory

Committee for the Special Session, says the purpose of the Session

is to

recommit world leaders to the goals and timetable adopted in 1990.

Durrant

says

that during the last 10 years, substantial progress has been made

in

fulfilling

the objectives of the World Summit for Children. But much still

remains to be

done, she adds. <P>

UNICEF says the reality of life is that more than 10 million

children under

the

age of five die each year, mostly from preventable disease and

malnutrition. <P>

Additionally, one-third of the world's children fail to complete

five years of

basic schooling while over 120 million of primary school age,

mostly girls,

are

not enrolled in school. <P>

At the same time, there are over 300,000 children who have been

recruited as

participants in armed conflicts worldwide while over 60 million

work in

dangerous circumstances. <P>

Meanwhile, the Geneva-based International Labour Organisation

(ILO) has also

launched a global movement for the ratification of the ILO

Convention on the

Elimination of the Worst Forms of Child Labour. As of December

last year, only

about 37 of the 189 UN member states had ratified it. <P>

The Convention, which applied to all persons under the age of 18,

directs

governments to ban practices such as slave labour and the bondage

of children. <P>

Other actions to be banned include the exploitation of children

through

prostitution or pornography, their use in armed conflicts, in the

service of

drug trafficking and in all forms of hazardous work. <P>

The convention also calls for enacting, implementing and enforcing

laws to

protect children of being exploited, as well as monitoring and

reporting on

progress. <P>

The ILO says the aim of the convention is to provide a decent

childhood for

250

million children who, at present, were obliged to work - 60

million of them in

the worst forms of child labour.
