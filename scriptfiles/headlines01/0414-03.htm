The caging of much of the old city of Quebec City to secure the 34-nation Americas summit is the &#34;greatest humiliation of Canadian democracy,&#34; civil-rights lawyer Clayton Ruby said yesterday.

</font>In the company of activists and cultural figures in various disciplines, Mr. Ruby made the comment behind a symbolic two-metre-high chainlink fence at a news conference in the gallery of the Ontario Heritage Centre in downtown Toronto.

<P>&#34;Had we been told a year ago that we were going to cage an entire city, no one would have believed it for a minute,&#34; he said.</P>

<P>&#34;The Canadian government cannot tell the difference between democratic protest and criminality, but clearly Canadian citizens can. Jean Chr&#233;tien, democracy is more than casting a ballot every four years.&#34;</P>

<P>Actress Sarah Polley, who organized the event along with author and columnist Naomi Klein, said the security clampdown on legitimate public protest in Quebec City is &#34;horrifying to those of us in the arts, who rely so heavily on freedom of expression to do our work.&#34;</P>

<P>The two initiated a petition to condemn what they call the largest police operation in Canadian history &#34;without a single act of violence in provocation.&#34; It has been signed by scores of well-known cultural personalities and thousands of others.</P>

<P>Because of the extraordinary interest, the petition is now being managed by the nationalist organization the Council of Canadians, which has posted it on its Web site (<A HREF="http://www.canadians.org" target="offsite">http://www.canadians.org</A>).</P>

<P>The petition says the security barrier and the 6,000 police who are expected to be on hand for the summit are hardly incentives to peaceful protest.</P>

<P>&#34;When the streets are blocked off and hundreds of meeting halls in Quebec City are out of reach to citizens because they are inside a sprawling &#39;security zone,' it is democracy itself that is marginalized.&#34;</P>

</font></font>Maude Barlow of the Council of Canadians said that had the government negotiated in good faith with the protesters, &#34;we could have worked within our own movement to deal with the very small element that might inclined to vandalism.&#34;

<P>Mr. Ruby said the obligation of the state toward demonstrators is to be &#34;protective, friendly, supportive,&#34; not a dissimilar obligation it has to the visiting heads of state.</P>

<P>&#34;But both can be accomplished with a different attitude than sealing off an entire Canadian city, an unprecedented and, I think, abhorrent symbol of what it means to be a Canadian this century,&#34; he said.</P>
