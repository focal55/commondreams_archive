            Reducing air pollution in just four of the world's largest cities--New 

            York; Mexico City; Sao Paulo, Brazil; and Santiago, Chile--could prevent 

            64,000 premature deaths and 37 million lost workdays over the next 

            two decades, according to research that examines the health effects 

            of the use of fossil fuels.<BR>

                  of burning fossil fuels, a study appearing Friday, Aug. 17, 

                  2001 in the journal Science, finds no question that air pollution 

                  from exhaust pipes and smoke stacks already is killing people 

                  worldwide. In the study, researchers examined the health effects 

                  of pollution from fossil-fuels on the rate of death in four 

                  cities - Sao Paulo, Brazil; Mexico City, Santiago, Chile; and

</table></font>Worldwide, the burning of coal, oil and other fossil fuels leads to 

            pollution that can result in elevated rates of infant mortality, asthma, 

            cardiovascular problems and respiratory ailments and could cause millions 

            of avoidable deaths worldwide over two decades, according to the new 

            work, which reviewed more than 1,000 scientific studies.<BR>

            <BR>

            The review is published in the current issue of Science. Worldwide 

            use of fossil fuels has been a major topic of debate in recent years 

            because of long-term concerns about global warming. Many scientists 

            believe that an increased amount of carbon dioxide--produced whenever 

            coal, oil or natural gas is burned--is the chief factor in the "greenhouse 

            effect" warming of the Earth's climate. If so, reducing use of such 

            fuels is vital, experts on global warming argue.<BR>

            <BR>

            Also, "the benefits of lowering emissions are immediate" because many 

            of the gases emitted when fuels are burned are also pollutants, said 

            George Thurston, one of the review's authors and an associate professor 

            of environmental medicine at the New York University School of Medicine.<BR>

            <BR>

            "Universal studies have shown when air pollution levels go up, you 

            get an increase in the numbers of deaths and hospital admissions, 

            missed days at work and school, and other adverse effects," Thurston 

            said.<BR>

            <BR>

            Much of the discussion on climate is about what will happen 50years 

            from now, said Devra Davis, the review's lead author and a visiting 

            professor in public policy at Carnegie Mellon University's H. John 

            Heinz III School of Public Policy and Management.<BR>

            <BR>

            "This review talks about what is going to happen tomorrow," she said.<BR>

            <BR>

            In addition to the study about pollution in the four cities, another 

            study examined in the review suggested that reducing emissions from 

            coal-fired power plants in the United States would save as many as 

            18,700 lives by reducing deaths from bronchial problems, heart disease 

            and other ailments.<BR>

            <BR>

            A third study indicated that air pollution from traffic causes more 

            deaths than do traffic accidents.<BR>

            <BR>

            A fourth study reported that alternative transportation policies initiated 

            during the busy 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta not only reduced vehicle 

            exhaust and air pollutants such as ozone by about 30%, they also decreased 

            the number of acute asthma attacks by 40% and pediatric emergency 

            admissions by about 19%.<BR>

            <BR>

            Some policy experts disagreed with the review's suggestions.<BR>

            <BR>

            The idea of reducing the use of fossil fuels to improve health is 

            "twisted science," said Myron Ebell, director of global warming policy 

            at the Competitive Enterprise Institute.<BR>

            <BR>

            Decreasing the use of cheap fossil fuels would result in higher energy 

            prices and lower public access to energy, he said. That, in turn, 

            could have a "huge impact on human health," particularly in poor countries, 

            Ebell said.<BR>

            <BR>

            Others, however, praised the work.<BR>

            <BR>

            "I think this is a very important paper that makes a very significant 

            contribution to understanding damage of greenhouse gas emission on 

            our future," said Dr. Paul Epstein, associate director of the Center 

            for Health and the Global Environment at Harvard Medical School.
