<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->OKLAHOMA CITY   - A lawsuit filed in the wake of a

police forensics scandal in Oklahoma City alleges an innocent

man may have been executed based on shoddy evidence analysis,

the defense lawyer who filed the suit said on Tuesday.

<p>Doug Parr, a board member of the Oklahoma Defense Attorneys

Association, said he filed suit this week to force the Oklahoma

City police department to hand over records and physical

evidence used to try and condemn Malcolm Rent Johnson, who was

executed in January 2000 for a rape-murder.

State agencies have reviewed over a dozen cases of men

sentenced to death but not yet executed to see if crucial

evidence should be re-tested after an FBI report alleged a

veteran police lab chemist, Joyce Gilchrist, had a record of

serious mistakes.

<p>But while defense lawyers have talked about the possibility

of wrongful executions, Parr said his lawsuit was the first

time the allegation has been made in a specific case.<p>``That's what a number of people are concerned about,'' Parr

said. ``That's why we are seeking an examination of the forensic

file and the physical evidence in this case.''<p>A spokesman for Oklahoma Attorney General Drew Edmondson

dismissed the allegations, saying there was overwhelming

evidence against Johnson besides physical traces, including

incriminating statements he made to police.<p>``The standard isn't 'did Joyce Gilchrist have anything to

do with the case?''' spokesman Gerald Adams said. ``The standard

is whether or not the conviction would stand on its own absent

forensic testimony.''<p>Johnson was put to death by lethal injection on Jan. 6,

2000, for raping and strangling to death Ura Alma Thompson, 76,

in 1981.<p>Parr said the suit in state court alleges Johnson was

convicted largely on the weight of Gilchrist's analysis of hair

and blood samples and her testimony about that in court.<p>Oklahoma City police have declined to release the Johnson

files, citing the ongoing investigation of lab work, Parr said.<p>Gilchrist, who is on paid administrative leave, has denied

the allegations contained in the FBI report in April that

criticized her work in five felony cases.<p>The FBI report, which led in May to the release of a man

after 15 years in prison on a wrongful conviction of rape, said

Gilchrist had misidentified hair and fiber samples and ``went

beyond the acceptable limits of forensic science'' in her

testimony in those cases.<p>State agencies are reviewing more than 1,600 felony cases

in which Gilchrist had a role, including 14 death penalty

convictions where the accused are still on death row. Of those

14, the state's attorney general has recommended evidence be

re-tested in three cases.
