BRASILIA, Brazil  - Thousands of poor rural

workers held protests across Brazil on Tuesday demanding the

government deliver land and funding the workers said they had

been promised.

<p>Starting at the presidential palace, about 1,000 protesters

from the radical Landless Movement, or MST, marched past

government buildings in Brasilia, while members of the group

held similar peaceful protests in 23 Brazilian states.

</font>The group has set up makeshift camps on the large

government esplanade in Brasilia where they will remain for 40

days to press their protests, said Joao Paulo Rodrigues, an MST

leader in Brasilia.<p>The MST, one of Brazil's few strong social groups,

advocates illegal occupation of unused farmland for poor rural

workers in this country where a handful of the rich own the

vast majority of arable land needed to make a living.<p>``We have almost 85,000 families camped out and waiting for

land to work, while families that were already settled have no

credits (funding) to cultivate anything,'' Rodrigues said.

''There is an explosive situation in the countryside.''<p>Rodrigues said leaders of the movement had met with

Agrarian Reform Minister Raul Jungmann in recent days but he

''did not meet our requests, so we decided to protest.''

<p>According to a statement from the group, the government has

not freed up funds for settling the landless because of new

commitments to meet strict fiscal targets agreed with the

International Monetary Fund.

<p>The MST said the government has cut the budget for land

reform to $520 million last year from $1.12 billion in 1997.<p>Brazilian President Fernando Henrique Cardoso's government

strongly defends its record on land reform, saying it is the

government that has given most land to the poor since Brazil

returned to democracy in 1985 after 20 years of dictatorship.<p>The government said it gave land to 482,206 families

between 1995 and 2000.<p>Protests by Brazil's landless have periodically led to

violent confrontations with the police. In the most violent in

recent times, 19 rural workers were killed by military police

during a land occupation in the Amazon in 1995.
