Working conditions at factories in El Salvador that make apparel for some 

of America's leading clothing firms are harsh, repressive and unsafe, 

according to a Salvadoran government report.

<P>The report was obtained by the National Labor Committee, a New York-based 

human rights advocacy organization, which said the study had been suppressed 

by the Salvadoran government for eight months.

<P>Neither El Salvador's embassy in Washington nor its consulate in San 

Francisco responded to calls seeking comment.

<P>The committee said, after conducting its own investigation of working 

conditions, that among the U.S. firms supplied by the factories it 

investigated is San Francisco-based The Gap.

<P>The report by the Salvadoran Ministry of Labor said that forced overtime, 

substandard wages, excessive production quotas, abusive and unsafe working 

conditions, and an animus against labor unions prevail in the country's 229 

"maquiladora" factories, which assemble garments for export, duty free.

<P>The report spoke in general terms of conditions throughout the maquiladora 

industry. But the National Labor Committee focused its investigation on 11 

factories that are suppliers for The Gap, Nike, Liz Claiborne and Kohl's.

<P>At The Gap's headquarters yesterday, spokesman Jack Dougherty said the 

company was taken by surprise by the report. He declined to comment on its 

allegations. Nevertheless, he said, The Gap's internal monitoring program has 

brought about some improvement in working conditions in the Salvadoran 

factories that are among its suppliers.

<P>The apparel-manufacturing industry, which operates in El Salvador's free 

trade zones, exported $1.6 billion worth of apparel to the United States in 

2000. Clothing is the nation's No. 1 export product, four times the size of 

the next three leading exports combined -- coffee, sugar and shrimp. The 

clothing factories employ more than 80,000 Salvadorans.

<P>According to the U.S. advocacy group, 100 copies were sent out from the 

Salvadoran Ministry of Labor to factory owners and several organizations. 

Furious factory owners protested to the government, and the report was 

recalled the next day. One copy, however, ended up in the hands of the 

National Labor Committee.

<P>The committee is a nonprofit group that has championed workers' rights 

around the world. In organized labor circles, it is known as "Amnesty 

International for Workers," according to Sharon Cornu, spokeswoman for the 

California Labor Federation, AFL-CIO.

<P>In 1996, the National Labor Committee made international headlines with a 

report that 13-year-old Honduran girls were working 13-hour shifts under armed 

guard for 31 cents an hour sewing pants for Kathie Lee Gifford and Wal Mart -- 

a disclosure that reduced Gifford to tears.

<P>Committee investigators looked into four of the factories that supply The 

Gap, two of them financed by Taiwanese capital.

<P>They found that the predominantly female workers at the factories face 

mandatory pregnancy tests, which are illegal under Salvadoran (and U.S.) law, 

were paid "11 1/2 cents for each $12.99 Gap T-shirt they sew," needed 

permission to drink water or use the bathroom and faced obligatory 12-hour 

shifts.

<P>"Any attempt to organize (unions) met with mass firings," the committee's 

report said.

<P>The group's executive director, Charles Kernaghan, said that committee 

investigators at one of the factories that supplies The Gap found water "where 

the bacterial level was 290 times greater than allowed under international 

standards. "

<P>The Gap's Dougherty said that "for the past five years Gap's factory 

monitors have worked with independent monitors in El Salvador to try to help 

factory owners improve conditions for workers. Everyone agrees that more work 

needs to be done, but we believe we have been able to make a greater impact 

than companies who do not monitor factories regularly," he said.

<P>The committee investigators found that The Gap's Code of Conduct, the 

company's guidelines for employee-company relations aimed at creating a safe, 

healthy workplace, had not been posted at its contracting factories, "nor has 

there ever been any explanation given to the workers regarding the content or 

purpose of the code."

<P>Dougherty said that calls will have to be made at the factories named by 

the National Labor Committee before he is able to respond to the charges.

<P>In a statement following the release of the report, Nike said that "we 

recognize that improvements in Nike partner factories is a continuous process, 

but it appears that Mr. Kernaghan rehashed old issues in an attempt to gain 

attention for his cause."

<P>The company said that "when problems are identified in our partner 

factories, Nike takes the necessary steps to correct those issues" and that it 

"supports and encourages the efforts of those who want to work together to 

truly improve working conditions for workers in the world's factories."

<P>Neither Liz Claiborne nor Kohl's could be reached for comment.

<P>The Salvadoran Labor Ministry report offered a brutally frank critique of 

the ministry's own performance. It cited a widespread perception among workers 

that many labor inspectors are corrupt and said that there is an "urgent need 

for a leap in the quality of the work of the Ministry of Labor in its 

principal activities."
