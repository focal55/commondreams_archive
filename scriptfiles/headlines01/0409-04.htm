Lockheed Martin Space Systems has created fictitious losses on the sale 

of some defense facilities in a scheme to reap tens of millions of dollars in 

windfall profits at taxpayers' expense, Sen. Thomas Harkin, D-Iowa, alleges.

<p class="inside-copy">In 

an interview and in a letter to the Defense Department, Harkin accused the space 

systems unit of Lockheed Martin Corp. of using "an apparent accounting trick" 

in an attempt to gouge taxpayers of perhaps $100 million. He cited three confidential 

reports done by Pentagon auditors. He says they found that the unit's accounting 

methods on the sale of facilities in California's Silicon Valley and elsewhere 

were "flawed, unreasonable, and inequitable to the government."</p>

<p class="inside-copy">Lockheed 

Martin, the nation's largest defense contractor, says its actions are proper. 

But, officials say, there is "an honest disagreement" between Pentagon auditors 

and the company over accounting methods. "We are in negotiations with" Pentagon 

auditors "about that disagreement," says James Fetig, chief spokesman for Lockheed 

Martin, "and we are committed to reaching a mutually acceptable agreement on the 

issue."</p>

<p class="inside-copy">Lockheed Martin's space systems unit is based 

in Denver. It has $5.5 billion in business with the Pentagon and NASA.</p>

<p class="inside-copy">Harkin 

is a leading critic of wasteful defense spending. He says that the Pentagon paid 

for improvements on the buildings, depreciation, and repair and maintenance expenses 

under its defense contracts with Lockheed Martin. When the company sold the facilities, 

however, it allocated all proceeds to the land and none to the buildings, Harkin 

says. That meant the Pentagon could not receive any of the proceeds. Regulations 

prohibit it from sharing in gains on land sales.</p>

<p class="inside-copy">Harkin 

says Lockheed Martin considered the buildings worthless. He says it now is proposing 

"to charge government contracts with over $95 million in losses for the supposedly 

worthless buildings."</p>

<p class="inside-copy">He says Pentagon auditors described 

the losses as "fictitious." He says that the buildings were valued at millions 

of dollars on tax rolls, that Lockheed Martin had made $22 million in improvements 

on some facilities as late as 1999 and that it now "plans to lease back some of 

the 'worthless' buildings at a cost of over $11 million." That expense will be 

charged to its defense contracts, he says.</p>

<p class="inside-copy">Lockheed 

Martin maintains that the buildings had no value. Officials say various buyers 

wanted only the land and have torn down the buildings or plan to do so. The buyers 

are putting up new office facilities on the sites, Lockheed Martin says.</p>

<p class="inside-copy">Harkin 

worries that the case is not unique, that other contractors may be attempting 

to use the same scheme. Senior defense officials say they are taking the case 

"very seriously" and plan to look into it.</p>
