UNITED NATIONS  - The Security Council has thwarted

an attempt

by the United States to lift the UN arms embargo against Ethiopia

and

Eritrea in the wake of a peace agreement signed last month by the

two

warring nations. 

<P>

UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who expressed strong reservations

over the

proposed US resolution, warned that it was not the appropriate

time to

resume the flow of weapons to a region still struggling to rebuild

its

war-ravaged economy. <P>

Annan said that ''silencing the guns'' did not necessarily mean

there was

peace in the Horn of Africa. ''The two countries face hard work

ahead. They

will need vision, patience and resources,'' he added. <P>

The Secretary-General has also warned that the humanitarian

conditions in

both countries ''remain a source of serious concern''. In Eritrea,

there

are over 300,000 internally displaced persons (IDPs) while

Ethiopia has

more than 350,000. <P>

''The most critical obstacle to their safe return and the

resumption of

normal life is the presence of landmines and unexploded ordnance

in areas

along the border,'' he said. <P>

UN spokesman Fred Eckhard told reporters that Annan had ''signaled

his

concern that the job is not done - as far as achieving permanent

peace that

is envisaged in the Security Council resolution''. <P>

On Wednesday the 15-member Security Council decided to postpone

action on

the US resolution to lift the arms embargo. The decision followed

a

closed-door discussion on the matter. The Council is expected to

resume

consultations later. <P>

Eckhard said the proposed resolution, however, is the Security

Council's

resolution. ''They can take any action that they might, and he

(Annan) is

not going to interfere in that process,'' Eckhard added. <P>

One of the countries that objected to the resolution is Canada,

which has

contributed over 550 troops to a new

UN Mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea (UNMEE) which will oversee the

peace

agreement. <P>

''It would be better to focus on confidence-building measures at

this stage

and give the peacekeeping troops a chance to get set up and to

establish

relationships with people on both sides,'' Canadian Ambassador

Paul

Heinbecker said. <P>

The Netherlands, which is contributing more than 1,100 troops, has

also

warned against immediate lifting of the arms embargo. <P>

When the Security Council imposed the arms embargo last May, it

said the

sanctions will initially last for 12 months ending May this year.

But it

also said that the ban would be lifted if the two countries

stopped fighting.

The existing embargo bans the sale or supply to Ethiopia and

Eritrea of a

wide range of military equipment, including ammunition, military

vehicles,

paramilitary equipment and even spares. <P>

All ''non-lethal military equipment'', intended solely for

humanitarian

uses and approved in advance by a Security Council committee, was

exempted

from sanctions.  <P>

The Security Council, which includes key arms suppliers to sub-

Saharan

Africa, decided to cut off military supplies in order to force the

two

warring parties to the negotiating table.  <P>

Russia, a veto-wielding permanent member of the Security Council,

has

delivered at least six fighter aircraft to Eritrea and eight to

Ethiopia,

all of them in 1998. The Russian-made MiG fighter planes have been

deployed

in dogfights over sub-Saharan skies.  <P>

The United States, another permanent member of the Security

Council,

supplied four Lockheed C-130 military transports to Ethiopia

during

1995-1996. All four were second-hand aircraft provided cost-free

under US

legislation designated ''Excess Defence Articles''. <P>

According to the UN Arms Register, Ethiopia has also taken

delivery of 50

T-55 battle tanks from Bulgaria and 40 from Belarus.  <P>

The resolution also bars UN member states from providing technical

assistance for the manufacture of weapons or military training

related to

the armed forces of the two countries. <P>

Meanwhile, UNMEE has deployed over three-quarters of its

authorised

strength of peacekeepers. As of last week, 71 countries have

contributed

3,433 military and 125 civilian personnel. When UNMEE was created

last

July, the Security Council authorised a peacekeeping force of

about 4,200

troops, including 220 military

observers. <P>

Besides Canada and the Netherlands, other key troop contributing

countries

include Jordan, Slovakia, Denmark, Italy, Bangladesh and India. <P>

The political tension between the two African nations has

continued since

the rebellious province of Eritrea became an independent nation

state in

May 1993 reducing Ethiopia to the status of a landlocked country.

Until its

independence, Eritrea was part of Ethiopia. Eritrea's war of

independence

against Ethiopia lasted about 31 years. Since then, the two

countries have

been involved in several border disputes. <P>

US Ambassador Richard Holbrooke, who led a Security Council

delegation to

the Horn of Africa last year, described the Ethiopian-Eritrean war

as one

of the worst in Africa. <P>

The Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees said the

conflict was

the ''world's largest war'' in 1999 because it involved 250,000

soldiers,

tens of thousands of casualties and over 60,000 civilians

displaced. <P>

Ambassador Mohamed Sahnoun of Algeria, the UN's Special

Representative

mediating the dispute, said it was ''the most devastating war in

Africa'' -

in terms of the number of people killed.
