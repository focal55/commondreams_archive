BOGOTA  - Six governors from southern Colombia asked

President Andrés Pastrana on Monday to order a halt to the use of

the glyphosate and other herbicides in eradicating illicit drug

crops, charging that the chemicals endanger human health and the

environment.

</table></font>Governors Pablo Muñoz, of Caquet department, Floro Tunubal, of

Cauca, Parmenio Cuéllar, of Nariño, Juan Cárdenas of Huila, Iván

Guerrero, of Putumayo, and Alfonso Jaramillo, of Tolima, explained

to Pastrana that the situation confronting the region is

explosive, as 35,000 indigenous peoples and peasants are

threatening to rise up in protest against the fumigations. <P>

   Governor Tunubal said that the aerial spraying begun last week

under the orders of the National Anti-Narcotics Directorate is an

attack ''against the life'' of his community, because the

glyphosate used also kills the areas food crops, contaminates the

water supply and surrounding jungle and, most importantly, harms

the health of the peasant farmers. <P>

   The fumigation operations are ''costly and ineffective,'' as

proved by the experience of the last 25 years. In that period, the

authorities have been using the herbicide to eradicate illicit

crops - including coca (used to make cocaine), marijuana, and

poppies (to produce heroin) - ''but the total area covered by

these plantations has expanded from 20,000 to 160,00 hectares,''

Tunubal pointed out. <P>

   The governors exhorted Pastrana to comply with the accord that

was signed in 1999 to put an end to a protest at that time against

state-ordered herbicide spraying. The agreement included the

suspension of fumigations in exchange for voluntary eradication of

the illicit crops by hand. <P>

   The departmental leaders also called on the president to adopt

an alternative plan that they have presented to the international

community, proposing the integral development of the southern

portion of the country as an alternative to Plan Colombia, which

is Pastrana's strategy to combat the drug trade and to attend to

social needs. <P>

   The People's Defender (ombudsman), Eduardo Cifuentes, repeated

Monday that the decision of the National Anti-Narcotics

Directorate to conduct aerial herbicide fumigation in southern

Colombia ''will bring grave consequences for the local ecosystems

and for the health of the region's inhabitants.'' <P>

   ''I believe that the state should have a margin of autonomy in

managing its internal policies... and in considering the effects

that this decision (to fumigate) has on the environment and the

population,'' said the government official, referring to the

Pastrana administration's promise to the United States under Plan

Colombia to eradicate illicit crops here within the next five

years. 

<P>

   Plan Colombia, which Bogotá and Washington define as ''a

strategy for peace, prosperity and the strengthening of the

state,'' has been loudly criticized by some 60 non-governmental

organizations (NGOs) in Colombia, Europe and United States that

claim it is causing an escalation of the country's decades-long

civil war. 

<P>

   The government-sponsored strategy has a budget of 7.5 billion

dollars, of which the United States is providing 1.3 billion,

largely in military aid for the anti-narcotics efforts underway in

the Colombian south and southeast, which are also regions with a

high presence of leftist guerrillas. <P>

   The policy to eradicate the illegal plantations of coca,

marijuana and poppies should be carried out, but through measures

that are ''reasonable and in line with the Colombian

Constitution,'' underscored Cifuentes. <P>

   The country's environmental legislation involves the universal

principle of precaution, which in this case requires the

authorities - the Ministry of Environment - to suspend the

fumigations until they have scientific proof that its effects are

innocuous for people and the environment, said the People's

Defender. <P>

   Nevertheless, in Colombia, the application of glyphosate and

other mixes of herbicides and agro-chemicals in anti-drug efforts

has continued despite the fact that the Ministry of Environment

has said the National Anti-Narcotics Directorate does not possess

an environmental management plan for carrying out the fumigations. <P>

   Marco Romero, of the state-run National University, said in

comments to IPS that the Directorate has pursued aerial spraying

of drug crops ''in an irresponsible way, violating all the related

environmental and constitutional laws.'' <P>

   The fumigation of illicit crops is outlined in the anti-drug

policy executed by the Pastrana government, and is closely linked

to the vision the United States holds of the drug trafficking

problem, says the academic. <P>

   In Romero's opinion, the US approach is that the narcotics

trade exists because Colombia has illegal drug plantations and, as

a result, it is a problem that must be attacked at the source of

production. <P>

   But many Colombian analysts interpret it the other way around:

illicit crops exist because they are encouraged by the lucrative

drug trade. One proof of this thesis is the ease with which the

drug crops reappear in other areas following fumigation at any

given site. <P>

   Nariño's Governor Cuéllar says that the government's zeal to

eradicate drug crops using aerial fumigations obeys the

obligations the Pastrana administration has to the United States

under Plan Colombia and Washington's approach to the narcotics

trade. <P>

   In Cuéllar's opinion, the United States sees the problem as the

mere existence of the drug crops, while for Colombians these

plantations exist because of ''the poverty and marginalization of

the peasant farmers.'' <P>

   The meeting of Colombia's southern governors coincided Monday

with the request in Brussels by European Parliament deputy Joaquín

Miranda, of Portugal, that Pastrana renounce aerial spraying of

drug crops in the Colombian south and that he back the alternative

plan proposed by the departmental leaders. 

<P>

   According to the European deputy, the fumigations carried out

''could ruin the possibilities proposed by those communities'' and

their authorities to resolve the problem of illicit crops through

manual eradication, crop substitution programs and other

economic alternatives. 

<P>

   The Cauca governor had presented this possibility in April

before the European Parliament and the European Commission, the

executive body of the European Union, both of which gave the

alternative plan their support.
