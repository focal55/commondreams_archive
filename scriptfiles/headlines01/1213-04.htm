BRUSSELS, Belgium  - Some 80,000 people marched through the

Belgian capital Thursday, demanding the European Union give labor

unions a larger role in shaping social policy and do more to cut

unemployment.

</table></font>The march came on the eve of a two-day summit of EU leaders that

is expected to draw anti-globalization activists from across Europe

for three other planned demonstrations. Police have stepped up

security, fearing a repeat of the violent protests that have

accompanied gatherings in recent years.

<p>

	   However, Thursday's march was peaceful.

<p>

	   ``This is an appeal for a more social Europe, we are not against

Europe,'' said Waltraud Etz, spokeswoman at the European Trade

Union Confederation, which organized Thursday's march.

<p>

	   ``We want more jobs and better quality jobs as the economic

situation isn't great,'' she said.

<p>

	   The group, which represents 60 million European workers from 25

countries, demands quality public services, more workers rights,

improved safety conditions at the workplace and an EU commitment to

tone down ``today's unbridled globalization.''

<p>

	   Unions and other groups presented Belgian Prime Minister Guy

Verhofstadt, who is hosting the summit, with a declaration setting

out their demands.

<p>

	   A separate declaration was handed over by a group of 45 activist

organizations calling on EU leaders to ``send a strong signal''

that the EU ``is firmly committed to the eradication of poverty.''

<p>

	   Meanwhile Belgian police detained 43 anti-globalization

protesters near the city center, after they chained themselves to

an abandoned building, protesting the lack of housing in Brussels

for visiting demonstrators.

<p>

	   City police Commissioner Christian De Coninck said the

protesters were apprehended as a precaution. ``This was an action

by people that are well organized. We are ready for them,'' he

said.

<p>

	   Thirty of the detained activists came from France, five from

Greece, two from Ireland, and two from Australia, police said,

adding that all non-Belgian nationals detained were told to leave

the country after being released. The other activists detained were

Belgian.

<p>

	   Wary of a repeat of violent summit protests in recent years,

Brussels police are taking tough security measures and deploying

3,000 police officers for the summit.

<p>

	   Police helicopters and water cannons were deployed alongside

riot police and horse patrols on the streets, officials said.

<p>

	   Belgian air force F-16 fighters were also to be placed on alert

as the threat of a possible terrorist attack looms large after the

events of Sept. 11.

<p>

	   Large areas around the wooded grounds of the royal palace of

Laeken - the summit venue - were off-limits to demonstrators as

well as the downtown houses of parliament and the Grand' Place,

Brussels' historic central square.</p>
