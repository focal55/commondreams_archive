<p> GHALEH SHAFER, Afghanistan, Nov. 22 — Most children in Afghanistan, lacking 

toys, play with what they find. In this tiny, dusty village, they have been finding 

pieces of a cluster bomb.</p>

<P> Three children were injured this week, and one teenager was killed, when they 

picked up undetonated remnants of a bomb dropped by American planes about a month 

ago. The bomb's initial impact killed 12 people, most from the same extended family. 

The village mourned, thinking it had seen the worst.</p>

<P> But workers from the Organization for Mine and Afghan Rehabilitation knew 

better. They are reluctant veterans of detonating unexploded ordinance — thanks 

to the millions of land mines in this country — and each morning they find and 

detonate a bomb's pieces. An explosion sounds every few minutes, the signal that 

one more threat has been neutralized.</p>

<P> But the detonators are finding themselves in a race against children's curiosity 

— and their hunger. The pieces of the bomb are yellow, the same color as the packages 

of food rations dropped by American planes this week. And while the Pentagon has 

said it plans to change the color of the food packets from yellow to blue to avoid 

confusion, it has not yet done so. So it was that 10-year-old Mohebolah Seraj 

went out to collect wood for his family, and thought he had happened upon a food 

packet.</p>

<P> He picked it up and lost three fingers in an explosion. Doctors say he will 

probably lose his whole hand. "It wouldn't matter if my daughter lost a hand," 

his mother, Sardar Seraj, said, weeping. "But my son was supposed to help support 

us."</p>

<P> She said that she cried and told the doctors not to cut off her son's whole 

hand. "But the doctors say it's impossible not to."</p>

<P> Mr. Seraj and her eight children are refugees from the drought- stricken Ghor 

Province. Now they live in one room in this village. Mrs. Seraj said she was so 

poor that she could not even afford a taxi to the hospital in Herat, so she walked 

the two or three miles.</p>

<P> The hospital where her son is being cared for is a grim place, lacking power 

and basic sanitation. In one room lay Muhammad Ayoub, a 20- year-old who was in 

the house when the cluster bomb initially landed. He lost a leg and his eyesight, 

and his face was severely disfigured. He moaned in agony.</p>

<P> Down the hall, sharing a room with several adults, lay two cousins, one 9, 

one 7, who were injured on Tuesday when they picked up an unexploded bomb while 

playing. Their grandmother nervously watched over them, but said she thought that 

they would be fine.</p>

<P> Hospital officials said that a 16- year-old had been decapitated on Wednesday 

after he picked up a piece of the bomb.</p>

<P> Back in the village, the family members who survived the bomb's initial explosion 

crowded in one room, refugees just feet from their own homes. One house was destroyed 

when the bomb fell; other homes that were damaged were deemed unsafe to return 

to until the mine experts finish their work.</p>

<P> Bashahmad Ahmadi, 25, who was at home when the bomb hit, saw three people 

die. "Suddenly I felt very hot, then I didn't feel anything." He has had surgery 

on his foot, but still walks with a crutch. His father, a teacher, was killed 

by the bomb, as were the husbands of three of his mothers' sisters. His mother 

has 10 children and 5 grandchildren.</p>

<P> Crutch or not, he must now find a way to support them all.</p>
