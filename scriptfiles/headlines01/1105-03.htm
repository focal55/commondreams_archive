LONDON - The U.S. and Britain have blundered into a bombing campaign that may have devastating consequences for Afghanistan and the volatile region of South and Central Asia, says one of Pakistan's leading politicians.

<P></P>

"Before the bombing, the Taliban did not have the support of the people," said Imran Khan, who heads the Pakistan Movement for Justice. "Now, instead of being isolated, they have turned public opinion in their favor.''

<P></P>

Khan, a popular cricketer-turned-politician, was visiting Britain last week in an effort to convince the Blair government that it must change course on the war on terrorism.

<P></P>

"We don't want a situation where even if the campaign succeeds, the world is a more dangerous place,'' he said.

<P></P>

Speaking at the Royal Institute of International Affairs, the opposition politician painted an alarming picture of a region sliding into destabilization, and Afghanistan entering a period of chaos if the Taliban is defeated.

<P></P>

The options for forming a new broadly based government in Afghanistan's multi-ethnic society are now much more limited, Khan said.

<P></P>

A moderate Pashtun politician, Abdul Haq, was executed by the Taliban after entering Afghanistan to try to build a new consensus. And the return of the elderly king Mohammed Zair Shah looks increasingly unlikely as Afghan casualties mount because the king now "lacks moral legitimacy.''

<P></P>

"How is a new government going to be formed?'' he asked, pointing out that the Northern Alliance, made up mostly of minority ethnic Tajiks and Uzbeks, doesn't have the support of the majority Pashtuns.

<P></P>

"I foresee guerrilla warfare going on for a long time, unless there is a broad-based government,'' said Khan. "Even if (Taliban spiritual leader) Mullah Omar disappears, there will be a lot of turmoil in the country.''

<P></P>

Afghanistan's regional neighbors Pakistan, Iran, the Central Asian states of Uzbekistan and Tajikistan, as well as Russia, are also squabbling over the composition of a future government.

<P></P>

What could result, Khan said, is a return to the chaotic times before the Taliban, when the Northern Alliance was unable to hold the country and ongoing warfare led to collapse of the government. Meanwhile in the south, violent warlords held criminal fiefdoms, extorting money from ordinary people, raping and murdering.

<P></P>

But, Khan said, if war drags on through the winter, as it appears likely to do, Pakistan will be in a desperate situation.

<P></P>

"The economy is close to bankruptcy, but that isn't the worst that can happen,'' he said, predicting the country's president, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, would be faced with growing dissent.

<P></P>

"In Pakistan there's a feeling of complete helplessness,'' he said. "Every day there are more reports of casualties in Afghanistan. At what point will Musharraf decide he can no longer back the United States?''

<P></P>

Continuing the bombing through the Muslim holy month of Ramadan is certain to cause more anger, he warned.

<P></P>

In Pakistan, Khan said, he visited many Afghan refugees who formerly opposed the Taliban. But now they are willing to lend them military support or take part in future terrorism against the U.S., as Afghan casualties mount.

<P></P>

"They hate the Taliban, but they hate the Northern Alliance more. And most of all they hate the U.S. They are perfect candidates for joining (Osama bin Laden's terrorist network) Al Qaeda.''
