NEW YORK &#150;&#150;  Fox News Channel is anything but fair and balanced when it comes to political guests, a watchdog group has charged.

<p>

Fifty of 56 partisan guests interviewed on Brit Hume's daily news show over a five-month period earlier this year were Republican, and only six were Democrats, the liberal group <a href="http://www.fair.org/" target="new">Fairness &amp; Accuracy in Reporting</a> said.

</table>In an admittedly more subjective analysis, FAIR said 65 of the show's 92 total guests were conservative politically.

<p>

"Fox portrays itself as fair and balanced, as straight news," said Steve Rendall, a FAIR senior analyst. "It's media consumer fraud."

<p>

Hume said he would look into the group's findings, and correct it if he noticed any imbalance.

<p>

Executives at the cable news network, which has been gaining on rival CNN in the ratings over the past few years, have repeatedly denied any right-wing tilt in news coverage. Its slogan is "fair and balanced," although founder Roger Ailes has called Fox an alternative to what he regards as a left-leaning CNN.

<p>

FAIR said it purposely chose to look at Hume's news report instead of more commentary-based shows like "The O'Reilly Factor." Rendall said the differential between Republican and Democratic, conservative and liberal guests was "breathtaking."

<p>

"There's nothing wrong with it," he said. "They can be proud of it. But I don't think anybody is served by mislabeling a conservative news product as fair and balanced."

<p>

Hume said FAIR's view of political bias may be different than most. And he said news factors &#150; FAIR watched during the first few months of a Republican administration, at a time the GOP also controlled Congress &#150; played a part in bookings.

<p>

"We don't strive for mathematical balance," he said. "We strive for an overall balanced outlook."

<p>

Hume also said his is not a political debate show, and he often doesn't know the leanings of his guests.

<p>

FAIR also studied Wolf Blitzer's news program on CNN during the same period and found that of 67 partisan guests, 38 were Republicans and 29 were Democrats.

<p>

FAIR's founder, Jeff Cohen, appears regularly as a commentator on Fox News Channel. The group said he played no part in the study.
