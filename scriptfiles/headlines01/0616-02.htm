CHICAGO  - A study of 641 U.S. doctors has found a

majority them favor legislation allowing physicians to join

collective bargaining organizations, according to the American

Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees.

<p>AFSCME, which represents about 14,500 doctors through two

affiliated union groups, sponsored the study, which found about

90 percent of the 641 salaried and nonsalaried doctors surveyed

believe the health care system ``has gotten worse for doctors.''

<p>The organization released the results of the study at a

news conference Saturday, a day before the American Medical

Association's annual meeting begins in Chicago.

<p>``What's surprising about these results is the lack of

ambiguity and the clarity of these results,'' said Ron Cohn, a

representative from Lake Snell Perry & Associates, the

political research firm that conducted the study. ``No matter

how you cut the data, no matter how you look at it...doctors

are frustrated with the state of health care and their changing

role.''

<p>The study found that doctors blame HMOs, private insurance

companies and the government for the current state of health

care. It also concluded that the biggest frustrations among

doctors are insurers' authority over medical decisions, the

quantity of paperwork and the amount of reimbursements.

<p>AFSCME representatives said at the news conference that

they hoped to convince the AMA of the benefits of collective

bargaining for physicians. The AMA halted efforts to unionize

private-sector physicians earlier this month after the U.S.

Supreme Court  ruled in May that nurses with supervisory

responsibilities are not permitted to join labor unions.

<p>AFSCME is affiliated with the Union of American Physicians

and Dentists and the Federation of Physicians and Dentists.
