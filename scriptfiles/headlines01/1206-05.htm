Blake, who led New Zealand to the America's Cup sailing championship in 1995 and 2000, was shot and killed by pirates in the Amazon on Wednesday, Dec. 5, his race sponsors said Thursday, Dec 6, 2001. He was 53.<br>

</font>Blake, 53, was on a <a href="http://www.blakexpeditions.com" target="_new">worldwide expedition</a> to monitor global

warming and pollution aboard his 119-foot yacht, said Alan Sefton,

spokesman for Blake's organization, blakexpeditions.

<p>

	   The vessel, called Seamaster, was in the mouth of the Amazon on

Wednesday night near Macapa, a city 1,600 miles north of Sao Paulo,

when three or four assailants approached in a rubber dinghy

``commonly used by river rats that ply the Amazon river in search

of victims,'' said state police chief Rosilene Martins de Sena.

<p>

	   ``Armed and hooded individuals came over the rail and had the

crew at gunpoint,'' Sefton said Thursday in a telephone interview.

``It would appear that Peter was down below and heard what was

going on and came charging up'' and was shot at least twice.

<p>

	   Two crew members were slightly injured but have been released

from the hospital.

<p>

	   Federal prosecutor Manoel Pastana told reporters the crew was

preparing a barbecue on the yacht when the gunmen appeared,

shouting ``Money! Money!''

<p>

	   According to local media, the killers took a spare engine and

several watches from the Seamaster, which had been awaiting customs

clearance to leave Brazil after a two-month stay.

<p>

	   Blake and a crew of 10 arrived in Brazil in October. Sefton said

they spent two months in the upper reaches of the Amazon and Rio

Negro and had encountered nothing but ``friendly, warm, hospitable

people.''

<p>

	   ``And as soon as the boat gets back into so-called civilization,

something tragic happens,'' Sefton told New Zealand's One News

television station.

<p>

	   New Zealand Prime Minister Helen Clark described Blake as ``a

national hero,'' and flags were at half-staff across the country.

Parliament paid tribute to Blake with a moment of silence and a

native Maori hymn.

<p>

	   ``I think he is to the waters what Sir Edmund Hillary (conqueror

of Mount Everest) has been to the mountains. He's just the most

amazingly accomplished yachtsman,'' Clark said. ``He was an

inspiration to all New Zealanders, and we will all feel a

tremendous sense of loss.''

<p>

	   New Zealand Ambassador Denise Almao flew into Amapa, the

governor's office said in a note.

<p>

	   Brazil's Foreign Ministry said in a statement that ``government

deeply regrets the tragic death of New Zealands' renowned explorer,

yachtsman and scientist.''

<p>

	   President Fernando Henrique Cardoso, the statement added, ``has

ordered that the criminals be promptly identified and arrested.''

<p>

	   Seamaster had been scheduled to sail up the coast to Venezuela

to meet blakeexpedition's jungle team. The vessel had previously

been on a three-month study of wildlife in the Antarctic region.

<p>

	   American skipper Dennis Conner, a three-time America's Cup

winner who was beaten by Team New Zealand 5-0 in 1995, praised

Blake.

<p>

	   ``He was a hero and role model for the New Zealand people and

obviously a winner that was focused and accomplished his goals,

whether it was winning the round-the-world race or the America's

Cup,'' Conner said Thursday.

<p>

	   In March 2000, Blake said he had received letters from someone

threatening to kill him and harm his family.

<p>

	   ``We've always got crank mail, but it has been going beyond that

recently,'' Blake said at the time. ``So we have taken all the

precautions we were advised to take.''

<p>

	   After Blake's 1995 America's Cup win, Governor General Dame Cath

Tizard said it was New Zealand's proudest day since Auckland native

Edmund Hillary became the first man to climb Mount Everest in 1953.



<p>

	   The America's Cup was the only major sailing trophy that the

self-proclaimed ``Nation of Sailors'' hadn't claimed, and Team New

Zealand under Blake won with one of the most dominating

performances in America's Cup history.

<p>

	   Blake was appointed in July as a goodwill ambassador of the

United Nations  Environment Program. Before that, he headed the

Cousteau Society, an environmental group founded in 1973 by the

late undersea explorer Jacques Cousteau.

<p>

	   Sefton said Blake considered the current expedition his last and

greatest adventure, hoping to create greater awareness of the need

to take care of the environment.

<p>

	   Blake, born in Auckland, announced earlier this year that he was

relinquishing control of the New Zealand syndicate. He was knighted

in 1995.

<p>

	   Blake, who began sailing at age 5, won the Whitbread Round the

World Race in 1989 and took the Jules Verne Trophy in 1994 by

sailing nonstop around the globe on a catamaran in 74 days, 22

hours, 17 minutes and 22 seconds. The record fell three years

later.

<p>

	   Last year, he led the first non-American entry to retain the

America's Cup in 149 years, beating Italian challenger Prada 5-0.

<p>

	   He is survived by wife Pippa and two children.
