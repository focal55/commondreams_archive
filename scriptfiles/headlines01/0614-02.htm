WASHINGTON  - Companies worldwide have signed on to

voluntary codes of conduct in a bid to mitigate globalization's

harmful aspects. Activists and executives agree the firms are

falling short but disagree on the reasons and remedies.

</table>No scheme that relies solely on corporations themselves will

successfully rein in corporate power, human rights and

environmental groups say. Rather, governments must step in and

enforce legally binding regulations on labor, environmental, and

other protections. 

<P>

   ''A new approach is needed,'' says Pieter van der Gaag,

executive director of the Northern Alliance for Sustainability, a

Netherlands-based coalition of European and US groups. ''The gap

between words and actions still seems to be large." <P>

   US environmentalists, for example, are lobbying to have

domestic environmental regulations extended to cover US firms'

overseas operations. They also want legislation that would hold

companies' feet to the fire and punish them for violations. Rep.

Cynthia McKinney, a Democrat from Georgia, is promoting a

Corporate Code of Conduct Act that would withhold government

incentives from companies found in violation of the voluntary

standards to which they subscribe. 

<P>

   The International Chamber of Commerce counts more than forty

codes of conduct designed to govern the activities of global

corporations. These include the Global Sullivan Principles, the UN

Global Compact, the Global Reporting Initiative, and the

Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)

guidelines on Multinational Enterprises. 

<P>

   Virtually none of these efforts include mechanisms to hold

companies accountable when they fail to comply, critics say. Even

some corporations complain the codes can be vague and confusing. 

<P>

   Thomas Delfgaauw, vice president of Shell International Ltd's

sustainable development program, says the oil company supports

many codes but wonders if it is time to stop developing even more

voluntary mechanisms. ''How does business deal with this plethora

of codes?'' he asks. 

<P>

   Compounding the problem, ''all these codes are mainly words

when the government spends money on projects that directly

contradict the guidelines,'' says van der Gaag. 

<P>

   The wealthy nations' Organization for Economic Cooperation and

Development, for example, in 1976 became one of the first official

bodies to pass voluntary corporate guidelines on labor, the

environment, corruption and human rights. The guidelines have been

periodically updated and stand apart from most others because they

include arrangements to investigate and punish violators. 

<P>

   Nevertheless, some OECD governments themselves have

underwritten projects targeted by critics as environmentally and

politically damaging - China's Three Gorges Dam, for example -

through state export credit and investment insurance agencies. <P>

   In January 1999, UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan challenged

business leaders to enact nine core principles enshrined in the UN

Global Compact, including labor and environmental protections. <P>

   Many large companies responded, among them Procter & Gamble and

DaimlerChrysler. Critics, however, say there is no assurance that

the companies uphold the compact's principles. Indeed, some go so

far as to suggest the effort mainly benefits the companies, whose

reputations gain sparkle from association with the UN logo. 

<P>

   ''The list of corporations involved in the Global Compact reads

like a who's who of environmental culprits,'' says Joshua

Karliner, executive director of the Transnational Resource and

Action Center, a California-based non-governmental organization.

<P>

   Global Compact partners include Shell, which stands accused of

reckless pollution and collusion with military dictators in

Nigeria, and BP Amoco, assailed for drilling for oil in the

Arctic. <P>

   Activists say imposing national laws on the companies'

operations overseas could prevent such conduct by US firms. Polls

conducted in recent years show growing public support for the

idea. But for executives, the prospect amounts to a legal and

regulatory can of worms being opened - with costly consequences

and the risk that companies will be held liable for the misdeeds

of outside suppliers and contractors. <P>

   ''God help us if individual governments take different

regulatory action regarding global corporate responsibility,''

says Shell International's Delfgaauw. ''That is the worst possible

nightmare that can happen to a multinational company.''
