UNITED NATIONS - UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan

said Tuesday he and diplomats at the world body were "disturbed"

by a U.S. statement claiming a legitimate right to extend military

attacks beyond Afghanistan.

</table></font>The threat to attack other, unnamed "terrorist states" - possibly

including Iraq and Syria - was implied Monday in a letter to the

UN Security Council from U.S. Ambassador John Negroponte. 

<P>

"There is one line in that letter that disturbed some of us,"

Annan said Tuesday. 

<P>

"I think the one sentence which has caused some anxiety amongst

the membership - which I've also asked about - was the question

that they (the U.S. administration) may find it necessary to go

after other organizations and other states," beyond al-Qaeda and

Afghanistan, he added. 

<P>

Annan noted, however, that the letter added this is not a

"predictor of any intentions" on Washington's part. <P>

"Basically, it is a statement that they are at early stages and

keeping their options open," he said. <P>

The U.S. State Department's list of seven "terrorist states"

includes Iraq, Iran, Syria, Sudan, Libya, North Korea, and Cuba. 

<P>

The U.S. Administration reportedly remains divided over whether it

also should launch military attacks on Iraq and other states in

the Middle East. 

<P>

Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, described as a hawk, is said to

have favored an attack on Iraq. But Secretary of State Colin

Powell and other members of the administration have said the

initial focus should be limited to Afghanistan, home to Osama bin

Laden, Washington's prime suspect as the mastermind behind Sep.11

terrorist attacks on New York and the Pentagon. 

<P>

Administration and independent diplomatic analysts have warned

that the broader the counter-terrorist attacks, the more difficult

it will prove to build and maintain the broad international

coalition from which Washington intends to draw political,

diplomatic, and material succor.

<P>

Washington is interested in ensuring that the coalition include

Muslim nations such as Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Kuwait, Bahrain,

the United Arab Emirates, and Pakistan - and possibly even Iran. <P>

So far, very few Muslim nations have volunteered to join the

coalition. Egypt and Iran have said they would enlist only if the

coalition were under the auspices of the United Nations. <P>

Pakistan and Saudi Arabia have volunteered their cooperation but

refused to permit their territories to be used to launch military

attacks on Afghanistan. <P>

Bahrain is home to the U.S. Navy's Fifth Fleet; the United States

also has pre-positioned military equipment in Oman. <P>

President George W. Bush continues to reiterate that his ''war''

against terrorism - and specifically against Afghanistan - should

not be construed as a campaign against Islam or Muslim nations. 

<P>

In his letter to the Security Council, Negroponte cited Article 51

of the UN charter, under which a member state is given the

legitimate right to launch military attacks in self-defense.

<P>

"Nothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of

individual or collective self-defense. if an armed attack occurs

against a member of the United Nations, until the Security Council

has taken measures necessary to maintain international peace and

security," Article 51 states in part. 

<P>

Negroponte described the Sep.11 terrorist strikes as "armed

attacks carried out against the United States." <P>

''There is still much we do not know. Our inquiry is in its early

stages," he added. 

<P>

In the one sentence that has evoked strong reactions, he said: "We

may find that our self-defense. requires further actions with

respect to other organizations and other states." 

<P>

Negroponte singled out bin Laden's al-Qaeda as the organization

behind last month's terrorist attacks. 

<P>

"Since September 11, my government has obtained clear and

compelling information that the al-Qaeda organization, which is

supported by the Taliban regime in Afghanistan, had a central role

in the attack," the letter said. <P>

Beginning Sunday, the United States has launched multiple air and

missile strikes against targets in Afghanistan. <P>

According to Annan, this has complicated the task of delivering

food aid to Afghans faced with famine. <P>

"We already had difficulties getting the trucks and the drivers

who would go in. And with the current situation, that's become a

bit more difficult," he said. 

<P>

Annan also regretted that U.S. bombing raids Tuesday killed four

Afghan nationals working for a UN mine-clearing project. 

<P>

Asked if there is anything the United Nations can do to protect

civilians, he added: "We have taken all the necessary precaution

we can, and those undertaking the operations have also assured us

that all effort will be made to avoid civilians, and that their

efforts will be targeted and focused on the alleged perpetrators.

And I hope that precaution will minimize civilian involvement." 

<P>

He added: "We have always maintained that there's no military

solution in Afghanistan and that the Afghans have to come together

and form a government."
