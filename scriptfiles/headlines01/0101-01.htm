Tropical forest fires may be worsening rainstorms far, far away -- in 

northern Europe, of all places.

<P>  It's the latest sign that when it comes to weather, all Earth is a "global 

village": A climate upset in one region can set off a different upset 

thousands of miles away.

</P>

<P>  The most famous example is El Nino, the quasi-cyclical warming of Pacific 

waters routinely blamed for many of the global meteorological headaches of 

recent decades.

</P>

<P>  El Nino is an all-natural phenomenon whose long history can be tracked in 

the alternating thin and thick stripes in tree rings over thousands of years. 

By contrast, a phenomenon for which humans are largely responsible may deserve 

some of the blame for the recent heavy storms off northern Europe, scientists 

suggest.

</P>

<P>  Over the last three to four decades, northern Europeans have complained 

that regional storms appear to be worse than ever. Winds are stronger; waves 

are higher.

</P>

<P>  Why? The probable causes are diverse, climatologists say. One may be global 

warming, prime among climatology's "usual suspects."

</P>

<P>  But another, more surprising factor may also be at work, scientists said 

recently at the American Geophysical Union conference in San Francisco: 

burning forests in lush tropical lands thousands of miles from the urban 

jungles of Europe.

</P>

<P>  The burning lands include regions of South America, Africa, Thailand and 

Indonesia where farmers burn down forests to clear land for farming.

</P>

<P>  These tropical blazes unleash mountainous smoke clouds that set in motion 

atmospheric effects, including a shift in storm tracks, that could partly 

explain why ocean storms have pounded northern Europe so relentlessly in 

recent decades, atmospheric scientists Daniel Rosenfeld and Hans-Friedrich 

Graf said.

</P>

<P>  Rosenfeld, a cloud physicist, works at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem. 

Graf, a meteorologist, is based at the Max Planck Institute in Germany.

</P>

<P>  While the causes of rainfall are complex, the fundamental explanation is 

clear. Rain falls when water vapor in clouds accumulates into droplets large 

enough to overcome their natural buoyancy in updrafts and, thus, to fall to 

Earth.

</P>

<P>  The accumulation of droplets is greatly accelerated by "aerosol" particles 

such as dust and smoke. Water vapor readily condenses onto aerosols.

</P>

<P>  Forest fires, however, fill rain clouds with an unnaturally large number of 

smoke particles, and water vapor condenses into so many particles that the 

water in the cloud remains, in effect, hopelessly subdivided. No large 

droplets accumulate, and no rain falls.

</P>

<P>  The capacity of air pollutants, including smoke, to suppress rainfall was 

described by scientists at last year's meeting of the organization, held in 

San Francisco in December 1999. That discovery was surprising enough in its 

own right: It suggested that tropical fires could suppress rainfall in those 

regions, worsening droughts.

</P>

<P>  "Clouds produce as little as half the rain when polluted as when 'clean,' " 

Rosenfeld noted at a press conference at this year's meeting.

</P>

<P>  At the latest conference, Rosenfeld and Graf proposed an even more far-

reaching consequence of tropical burning. They theorize that fire-triggered 

suppression of rainfall sets in motion a complicated chain of atmospheric 

events -- among them, a shift in storm tracks over the north Atlantic.

</P>

<P>  That is the reason storms have clobbered northern Europe in recent decades, 

Graf's computer model suggests. "If it doesn't rain in one place, it rains in 

another place more," Rosenfeld explained.

</P>

<P>  Global warming and the climatic effects of recent major volcanic eruptions, 

according to Graf's model, contributed more to increasing the frequency of 

storms in northern Europe than tropical burning.

</P>

<P>  Still, Rosenfeld and Graf's research illustrates how environmental changes 

in one region -- including those that can be blamed on humans, like burning -- 

may affect weather on a distant continent.

</P>

<P>  "Weather is like a global village," Rosenfeld said.
