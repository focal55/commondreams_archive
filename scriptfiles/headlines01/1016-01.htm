The United States pounded three Afghan cities with intense bombing raids yesterday and launched a fresh propaganda onslaught to counter growing opposition to its antiterrorism campaign.

<P>In the heaviest bombardment yet, about 50 attack jets and 10 B-1 and B-52 bombers blasted targets in Kabul, Jalalabad and Kandahar, seat of the ruling Taliban regime.</P>

<P>CNN quoted witnesses in Kandahar who said they heard the sound of helicopters, as well as heavy small-arms fire.</P>

<P>Pentagon sources told the network that a fixed-wing AC-130 gunship was used to attack ground positions.</P>

<P>U.S. officials have previously said that the Pentagon plans low-flying raids by helicopter gunships to hunt forces allied to Osama bin Laden's al-Qaeda network and forces of the ruling Taliban regime.</P>

<P>With major military installations and air-defense targets already knocked out, yesterday's strikes appeared to be aimed largely at Taliban troop concentrations.</P>

<P>Targets on the weekend included &#34;terrorist camps,&#34; training facilities, headquarters, garrison and troop staging areas, said Air Force General Richard Myers, chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff.</P>

Khanzada was wounded in the village of Karam, some 50 kilometers (30 miles) west of Jalalabad, Afghanistan, during what Taliban officials say was a U.S. air attack. According to the Taliban government, who organized a visit to the village by foreign journalists, around 200 civilians were killed in Karam on Thursday, during a U.S. air attack.

</font>But the strikes were accompanied by growing criticism

<P>The Pentagon has acknowledged that four civilians were killed by a 1,240-kilogram bomb that slammed into a Kabul neighborhood on Saturday.</P>

<P>Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld said Taliban claims of significantly higher civilian casualties were &#34;ridiculous.&#34;</P>

<P>But he acknowledged that the United States' image has suffered.</P>

<P>&#34;To the extent we need to do a better job to make sure that people are not confused as to what this is about, then we darn well ought to do a better job,&#34; he said.</P>

<P>Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and Indonesia, three of the world's largest Muslim nations, voiced strong concerns about the bombing.</P>

<P>The U.S.-led bombing began Oct. 7 and has included day and night raids for nearly a week.</P>

<P>&#34;We wish the United States had been able to flush out the terrorists in Afghanistan without resorting to the current action . . . because this is killing innocent people,&#34; Saudi Interior Minister Prince Naif told reporters.</P>

<P>The U.S. hearts-and-minds campaign intensified as National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice agreed to an interview with Al-Jazeera, the Arabic-language television network which has been criticized for airing unedited statements by Mr. bin Laden.</P>

<P>Ms. Rice insisted that the U.S. campaign &#34;is not a war against Islam.&#34;</P>

<P>But Afghans reaching Pakistan from Kandahar said the bombing is rallying support for the puritanical Taliban regime.</P>

<P>&#34;I've seen the bodies of women and children pulled out of the rubble of their homes,&#34; shopkeeper Abdul Wali said. &#34;People are getting angry.&#34;</P>

<P>In Indonesia, riot police used tear gas and water cannons to rout about 700 anti-U.S. protesters outside the country's parliament. Late Sunday, President Megawati Sukarnoputri stated that &#34;no individual, group or government has the right to try to catch terrorist perpetrators by attacking the territory of another country.&#34;</P>

<P>In Pakistan, where U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell arrived last night for talks, Foreign Ministry spokesman Riaz Mohammed Khan said: &#34;Prolongation of military operations will be a source of concern to us.&#34;</P>

<P>Results of two opinion polls indicated that 83 per cent of Pakistanis sympathize with the Taliban regime, although 51 per cent also agreed with President Pervez Musharraf's decision to co-operate with the United States.</P>

<P>White House spokesman Ari Fleischer dismissed concerns that support for Washington is eroding.</P>

<P>&#34;The best defense in this case is a strong offense,&#34; he said. &#34;And that message has been received well by our allies.&#34;</P>
