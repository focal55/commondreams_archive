WASHINGTON   - Reversing a position it adopted

nearly 30 years ago, the Justice Department is preparing a

formal legal opinion that individuals, not just groups, have a

constitutional right to own guns, a view advocated by Attorney

General John Ashcroft, officials said on Wednesday.

<p>They said the department's office of legal counsel was

drafting the opinion, which would be a shift from the position

it took in 1973 under Republican President Richard Nixon that

there was no personal constitutional right to own or use a

gun.<p>The letter, denounced by gun-control groups, represented a

break from the government's prior position that the Second

Amendment only conferred a collective right to own guns through

militias, and not an individual right.<p>Sarah Brady, chairman of the Brady Center to Prevent Gun

Violence accused Ashcroft of ``jettisoning'' a long-standing U.S.

government position to replace it with the ``discredited

interpretation held by the gun lobby.''<p>``His position is also dangerous, as it would only make

defending reasonable gun laws -- laws that Americans

overwhelmingly support -- more difficult,'' she said.<p>The opinion will incorporate the views Ashcroft first

expressed in a letter to the National Rifle Association in May.

The officials said Ashcroft, an NRA member, expressed official

Justice Department policy in the letter, not his personal

views.<p>In another move applauded by the NRA, Ashcroft last month

announced plans to slash the amount of time the government can

keep records of instant background checks for gun buyers.<p>One official said the Justice Department would continue to

defend existing gun laws in court, even after the opinion had

been completed.<p>In his letter, Ashcroft said the Second Amendment did not

prohibit Congress from enacting laws restricting firearms

ownership for ``compelling state interests.''

<p>The issue of whether the Second Amendment applies to

individuals is before a federal appeals court based in New

Orleans, and the case could then be appealed to the U.S.

Supreme Court.

<p>The Second Amendment says, ``A well-regulated militia, being

necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the

people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.''<p>Seth Waxman, solicitor general under Democratic President

Bill Clinton, said in a letter nearly a year ago that

successive Democratic and Republican administrations, the

Supreme Court in 1939 and eight U.S. appeals courts had

rejected arguments the Second Amendment extended firearms

rights to individuals.
