ROME  -  An Italian anti-globalization protester who witnessed the fatal shooting of another demonstrator at the G8 summit in Genoa described in an interview Tuesday how the officer who fired the fatal shot shouted "I'm going to kill you."

<p>"I was there when Carlo (Giuliani) was killed, shot with a pistol in the face," the unnamed demonstrator told Italian newspaper Il Corriere della Sera, adding that he took part in the attack on a police vehicle shortly before the killing.</p>

<p>"I was also throwing stones and other objects at the jeep. I saw the gun aimed and I heard the officer shout 'bastards, I'm going to kill you, I'm going to kill you'," the demonstrator told the paper.</p>

<p>"I shouted 'let's go, let's go, he's going to shoot.' Just before I ran off... I heard two close shots, then a third. I was safe, down a side street and there was a man lying dead on the tarmac in a puddle of blood."</p>

<p>"I only discovered later that it was my friend little 'Carletto' Giuliani," added the demonstrator, identified as a 23-year-old from the northwestern city of Genoa, where the G8 summit was held 10 days ago.</p>

<p>"I could be wrong, but I'm convinced that the officer who fired did not do so in legitimate self defense but rather through fear," he added. </p>

<p>"We were all very tense, furious," he described, saying that repeated police charges against peaceful protesters had unleashed a collective fury among demonstrators.</p>

<p>The Italian government has come under heavy pressure both at home and abroad to explain what critics have labeled disproportionate brutality among the ranks of officers policing the forum.</p>

<p>Violent clashes between some 150,000 anti-capitalism demonstrators and Italian security forces resulted in one fatality, hundreds of injuries and more than 200 arrests, overshadowing the main events of the summit of world leaders.</p>

<p>While defending the police operation, Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi has announced that a team of senior interior ministry officials will carry out an inquiry into allegations of police mistreatment.</p>

<p>Opposition deputies have called for the resignation of Interior Minister Claudio Scajola.</p>

<p>On Monday, Italian President Carlo Azeglio Ciampi intervened to demand that incidents surrounding the summit be properly investigated.</p>
