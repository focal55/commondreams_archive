Urges White House to enforce conditions for military aid

MEXICO CITY - On the eve of U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell's arrival in Bogota, a leading rights group says increased American military aid to Colombia ``raises serious questions'' about U.S. responsibility for that country's human rights crisis.

<P></P>

Washington-based Human Rights Watch yesterday appealed to the White House to enforce strict conditions on military aid to the most violent country in the world and to support the organizations who are trying to stop the slaughter.

<P></P>

The principle reason 40 per cent more civilians were massacred last year than the year before, and that 568 have died in the first six months of this year, according to the report, is the Colombian government's failure to break ties with the death squads.

<P></P>

Instead, it said, the military has ``carte blanche'' to work with them.

<P></P>

``Human Rights Watch continues to document abundant, detailed and compelling evidence that certain Colombian army brigades and police detachments promote, work with, support and tolerate paramilitary groups, treating them (as a) force compatible with their own,'' it said, describing the perceived common struggle against Marxism.

<P></P>

The government has been fighting the 16,500-strong Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), as well as smaller rebel groups, for 37 years.

<P></P>

Washington has already sent $1.3 billion (U.S.) in military aid to Colombia, citing rebel involvement in the narcotics trade as the reason for money that has gone to training and equipping Colombian troops and providing in-country U.S. military personnel.

<P></P>

The military aid - called Plan Colombia - is focused on southern Colombia, where FARC is entrenched in a demilitarized zone that covers almost 40 per cent of the country.

Recently, there have signs the U.S. administration is poised to push for increased military spending beyond Plan Colombia, which has been criticized as a thinly veiled counter-insurgency plan that is pulling the U.S. deeper into Colombia's civil war.

<P></P>

The U.S. Congress set limits of 500 active-duty military personnel and a further 300 military contract workers in Colombia.

<P></P>

In Washington this summer, the House of Representatives voted down a White House request to lift that cap because of concern about ``mission creep'' in which Colombia would turn into another Vietnam. Powell has indicated the administration wants to extend Plan Colombia to neighboring Ecuador and Peru, and U.S. officials have discussed plans for expanded American military training of Colombian units.

<P></P>

Powell, set to meet Colombian President Andres Pastrana during a two-day visit this week, will be accompanied by, among others, Marine Gen. Peter Pace, the top U.S. general for Latin America and an architect of Plan Colombia.

<P></P>

Colombian and international rights groups condemn U.S. involvement, saying the money is going to a Colombian army that turns a blind eye to the war of terror against civilians.

<P></P>

``Human rights defenders, trade unionists, journalists and community leaders continue to lead the lists of people killed because of their work,'' the Human Rights Watch report said.

<P></P>

The biggest perpetrator is a group known as the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (AUC), based in the north, but operating throughout the country. Yesterday, with Powell's upcoming visit, the U.S. renewed its listing of the AUC as a ``foreign terrorist organization.''

<P></P>

But Human Rights Watch underscores a contradiction in the U.S. position. Last year, it said, former president Bill Clinton waived human rights conditions on Plan Colombia, which would have forbidden support for army units engaged in abusive behavior against the civilian population.

<P></P>

``With that signature, the White House sent a direct message to Colombia's military leaders that overshadowed any other related to human rights,'' said the report. ``Judged by the Colombian military's behavior in the field - not by rhetoric of public relations pamphlets - its leaders understood this message clearly.''

<P></P>

The report cites evidence of ``brazen'' co-ordination, including communications via radios, cellular telephones and beepers; shared intelligence, including the names of suspected guerrilla collaborators; and the sharing of fighters, billeting on army bases, army trucks and road blocks.

<P></P>

Even when officials, including the government's own investigators, provide exact locations of paramilitary bases, or the license plates, types and colors of their vehicles, their fighters are not apprehended.

<P></P>

``Despite dozens of `early warnings' of planned atrocities, paramilitaries advanced, killed, mutilated, burned, destroyed, stole and threatened with virtual impunity, often under the very noses of security forces sworn to uphold public order,'' the report said.

<P></P>

In recent years, The Star has documented several such massacres, including last summer's killing of six men in the northern Andes village of La Union, despite a blanket military presence in the area. An army helicopter circled during the massacre, according to eyewitness accounts from nuns from the Missionary Order of the Sacred Heart.

<P></P>

Meanwhile, a leader of Colombia's Medellin cartel pleaded innocent in a Miami court yesterday to charges that he helped smuggle 30 tons of cocaine a month.

<P></P>

Fabio Ochoa, 45, was flown to Miami over the weekend to face the charges.

<P></P>

He is the biggest fish to face U.S. justice since Colombia revived its extraditions five years ago.
