The French foreign minister, Hubert V&eacute;drine, accused the United States of self-interest yesterday and said that the Bush administration was hindering the international community's efforts to solve the problems of globalization.

<P>In the latest Gallic attack on what is politely referred to in France as "American economic and cultural hegemony", Mr V&eacute;drine told French ambassadors in Paris that France would pursue its efforts towards "a humane and controlled globalization., even if the new high-handed American unilateralism doesn't help matters".  

<P>Mr V&eacute;drine said France had learned from the recent wave of anti-globalisation protests   and backed "reasonable demands as far as globalization. is concerned, because we too do not want rampant unrestrained globalization.".  

<P>The outburst was by no means Mr V&eacute;drine's first attack on US policy. He has previously criticized President Bush's decision to abandon the Kyoto accord to combat global warming and the American president's determination to pursue a US missile defense scheme.  

<P>Earlier this year he was also scathing about America's reluctance to commit itself fully to an international campaign against money-laundering. He said that such market-driven attitudes "prevent the emergence of a global consensus to combat the destructive effects of globalization.".
