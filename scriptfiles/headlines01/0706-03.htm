RIO DE JANEIRO  - Preserving and promoting gastronomic

diversity - threatened by the rushed pace of modern society - are

the goals of Slow Food, an international movement, based in Italy,

that began 15 years ago and continues to win followers worldwide. 

<P>

   Its name is an intended contrast to ''fast food'', the globally

recognized symbol of which is the US-based restaurant chain

McDonald's. But Slow Food's activities and ideas are wide-ranging,

encompassing a variety of dimensions of life - beyond meals. 

<P>

   Local Slow Food groups are known as ''convivium'', a Latin term

meaning ''banquet'' and which gave rise to the English word

''convivial'' - fond of feasting and merry company - and the

French ''convive'' - dining companion. 

<P>

   There are at least 560 convivia in 45 countries, with some

60,000 members in all, according to the Slow Food website

(<a href="http://www.slowfood.com" target="new">www.slowfood.com</a>). 

<P>

   The movement rejects the ''globalization of a taste that does

not belong to the people,'' explained Jorge Ossanai, a doctor in

the southern Brazilian city of Porto Alegre. His interest in

ethnic food and his travels as an international consultant brought

him into contact with Slow Food, of which he is now an active

member. 

<P>

   The protest against hurried and solitary meals has expanded to

include efforts to protect the culinary culture of each community,

explained Margarida Nogueira, a food consultant and organizer of

the convivium in Rio de Janeiro. 

<P>

   Conservation of this sort of culture occurs through recovering

traditional dishes that are threatened with disappearing forever,

such as the 'lardo de Colonnata,' an Italian bacon prepared in

marble Carrara boxes, Nogueira told IPS. <P>

   ''We have a tendency to kill traditions,'' which impoverishes

gastronomy, lamented the expert. To fight this trend, she has

plans to recover some of the typical dishes of Rio de Janeiro

state. One of her concerns, for example, is the ''disappearance''

of a purple sweet potato from supermarket shelves, a vegetable she

frequently enjoyed in the past. <P>

   Along those lines, the Rio convivium, founded last November,

meets monthly and is promoting meetings with farmers who grow

produce that does not always reach the larger markets. <P>

   Traditional food products, often hand-processed by a community

or by a family, are far from the consumer market, and so are

relatively expensive, Nogueira pointed out. <P>

   To save certain foods from oblivion, Slow Food created the Ark

of Taste, an evocation of Noah, as a mechanism for the

preservation of taste diversity and biodiversity. <P>

   At first, the Ark was intended to identify and catalogue nearly

forgotten fruits, vegetables, herbs, and sweets - and to promote

their consumption. <P>

   When the movement discovers that a dish is at serious risk of

extinction, its takes action to support the preservation of the

food - or drink -, as was the case of Sciacchetra white wine,

produced in the Italian mountains of Cinque Terre. <P>

   The movement also engages in social projects through its

''fraternity tables,'' which provide food to impoverished or

conflict-ridden communities. 

<P>

   In Brazil, the Slow Food Hekura Project is in charge of the

hospital kitchen at Porto Velho, capital of the Amazon state of

Rondonia, a health center that provides medical attention to the

region's indigenous population. 

<P>

   The mission there is to ensure that indigenous patients who are

undernourished or have a slow recovery process ahead of them are

provided with their traditional foods, so that they do not have to

adapt to the food available in the predominantly ''white'' cities,

Nogueira explained. 

<P>

   Ossanai, for his part, said that within the Slow Food movement

another parallel philosophy has arisen, known as Slow City, with

the intent to protect the heritage of smaller urban centers as a

means to foment local cultural identity and to preserve the

environment. 

<P>

   In Italy, the program already involves a network of 36

cities. Slow City activists in southern Brazil are attempting to

launch similar efforts in Antonio Prado, in the southern state of

Rio Grande do Sul, home to 48 wooden houses built more than 125

years ago by Italian immigrants. 

<P>

   To preserve this sort of heritage, which ''the local population

is sometimes ashamed of,'' the movement provides technical advice,

mobilizes local resources and seeks international financing,

reported the Porto Alegre physician. 

<P>

   Each convivium attempts to spread the ideas behind Slow Food

through public presentations, visits to farming areas and ''taste

education'' activities targeting children, so that they might

learn to use their senses ''as an instrument of knowledge'' and to

appreciate food as an important part of their culture. 

<P>

   As of last year, the movement grants a Slow Food Award for the

Defense of Biodiversity to five food-related projects around the

world. An international jury of 460 people, selected from among

journalists, anthropologists, sociologists and chefs, made the

selection for the first-ever awards. 

<P>

   One of the recipients was Raúl Manuel Antonio, leader of a

Mexican indigenous community, for his efforts to maintain vanilla

and cacao crops after they had nearly disappeared from the region

of Chialta, in the southwest state of Oaxaca. <P>

   Another prizewinner was Nancy Jones, of Mauritania, who

convinced the livestock herders in her country to produce cheese

using camel milk, something local residents had formerly rejected

because they considered the milk sacred. <P>

   For this year's Slow Food Award, to be presented in the

Portuguese city of Oporto this October, Brazil's convivium leader

Nogueira nominated Sitio do Moinho, a farm near Rio de Janeiro

that grows a broad range of organic produce, meaning no agro-

chemicals are used. <P>

   Manoel Dantas Vilar, a rancher in northeast Brazil who produces

cheese from a local species of goat, an animal resistant to the

region's many droughts, is another candidate. <P>

   And yet another Brazilian aspirant for this year's prize is

Kimio Shimitsu, of Japanese descent, who prepares food - as well

as homes, furniture and water filters - using bamboo, in Mogi das

Cruzes, near Sao Paulo.<p align="center">Copyright 2001 IPS</p>
