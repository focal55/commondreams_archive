BRUSSELS -- When kids in Sweden watch the Pokemon cartoon series, they

don't hear the jingle that everywhere else in the world ends each show:

"Gotta catch `em all." The country's consumer ombudsman deemed it

stealth advertising, ruling that the tune is a surreptitious plug for

Pokemon playing cards.



<p>That's illegal on Swedish television. In fact, Stockholm has prohibited

all TV advertising aimed at children under the age of 12 since 1991, so

the ruling wasn't all that radical. What alarms advertisers and

broadcasters is that Sweden wants the rest of Europe to follow its lead.

It has used its six-month stint in the rotating presidency of the

European Union to push hard for severe restrictions on television

commercials directed at youngsters, and it's made headway.



<p>"They've understood the usefulness of a presidency to start a wider

campaign," says Stephan Loerke, a lobbyist for the World Federation of

Advertisers in Brussels. "They're gradually trying to forge a consensus

among the member states."



<p>The crusade is well-timed. The law establishing minimum

consumer-protection standards for cross-border television broadcasts in

the EU - the 1989 Television Without Frontiers Directive, last revised

in 1997 - is up for review at the end of 2002.



<p>Sweden is trying to forge a consensus to raise the EU's standards for

the entire union. The commission is duty-bound to hold hearings on the

directive, which outlaws all advertising within any children's

television program running for 30 or fewer minutes. An informal meeting

by the EU's culture ministers discussed the subject yesterday and they

are expected to take it up again in Luxembourg in June.



<p>An outright ban modeled on Sweden's is unlikely anytime soon. But

increasingly tough partial bans, especially on commercials directed at

small children, aren't. Partial bans could cover ads that appear within

five minutes of a children's television show, for example. Or junk food

ads could be banned altogether around kids' TV. What's more, to

forestall government rules, the advertising and broadcasting industries

could implement limits "voluntarily".



<p>Many of the EU's 15 members have harsh restrictions on their books -

including three of the four countries that will each hold the presidency

for six-month stretches over the next two years, and that will set the

agenda for meetings of EU cultural ministers and summits of heads of

state.



<p>Belgium takes over in July, and Flanders, the Dutch-speaking part of the

country, prohibits any advertising within five minutes of a

Dutch-language children's TV program broadcast from within the country.

Denmark recently convinced domestic broadcasters to voluntarily abide by

a five-minute rule. Greece doesn't permit stations to run commercials

for toy guns, tanks or other instruments of war, and bars ads for all

other toys between 7 a.m. and 10 p.m.



<p>Lawmakers in Norway, Italy and Poland are debating setting similar

boundaries, to the horror of broadcasters. "A ban on children's

advertising would be catastrophic for Europe's television production

community," says Cindy Rose, a Brussels-based lobbyist for Walt Disney

Co. of Burbank, California. "They rely on advertising revenues to fund

high-quality children's programming."



<p>Broadcasters argue that the revenue generated in the EU every year by TV

ads for children's products - between 670 million euros and 1 billion

euros - is essential for the creation of quality children's programming.

European governments have been pushing television stations to produce

more of their own shows, to reduce the amount of American-made content

that fills up TV schedules, but for-profit station owners say that

without sufficient ad revenue, only fee-supported broadcasters will be

able to even try to do so.



<p>For its part, the European Commission, the EU's executive branch,

believes kid-directed advertising is already adequately regulated in the

EU. The commission recently conducted a comprehensive review of existing

rules in the union and found that, with the possible exception of those

regarding pornography and violence, "we don't need to change anything,"

says Christophe Forax, a spokesman for European Education and Culture

Commissioner Viviane Reding.



<p>But many countries think more is needed. "We'd agree: no advertising

during children's programs," says Pascal Ennaert, an adviser to the

youth minister of Flanders, who will be responsible for youth issues

during the Belgian EU presidency. Flanders has the five-minute rule, but

it has no control over Dutch channels broadcast from the Netherlands, or

over French programs coming from other parts of Belgium -- or over

anything transmitted via satellite.



<p>The porosity of national borders when it comes to broadcast signals is a

problem for Stockholm, too: All of Europe would have to outlaw

children's advertising for Sweden's total ban to really work, especially

with the proliferation of satellite broadcasts and Internet Web-casts.

"Commercial pressure on children is increasing," says Maria Gasste, who

heads the unit on children's television in the media division of the

Swedish culture ministry.



<p>Ms. Gasste, who has two young sons and has watched Pokemon with them at

home, accuses the advertising industry of trying to polarize the issue

in terms of a total ban vs. total freedom. "They say if you don't have

brutal killings in the ads it's okay," she says. "It's not that easy."



<p>While it seems unlikely that all TV ads pointed toward children will be

banned throughout the EU, advertisers and broadcasters are preparing to

fight moves to tighten current checks. "Talk and talk of a ban and then

settle for restrictions to TV advertising when it comes to the review of

the directive - that appears to be the Swedish tactic," says Simon

Pitts, European affairs manager for U.K. broadcaster ITV. "The result

would be the same in either case."



<p>Sweden's Radio and TV Act has banned ads directed at kids from the first

day that commercial television was allowed in the country on July 1,

1991. The ban was based on research that indicates children can't fully

distinguish between advertising and programming until about age 10.



<p>Scandinavian satellite broadcaster TV3 beams its Swedish-language

channel from a base in the U.K. Sweden challenged the broadcaster's

right to do that in Europe's top court and lost.



<p>TV3's only commercial competitor, TV4, is the one that ran into the

Pokemon wall. The national consumer ombudsman last year won a court

injunction declaring the "Gotta catch 'em all" rap - sung in Swedish --

a strictly commercial part of the cartoon series, and therefore a breach

of the anti-ad law.



<p>Nintendo Co. of Kyoto, Japan, which owns the Pokemon franchise, didn't

return calls seeking comment.



<p>In the cartoon, Ash, a Pokemon trainer, attempts to collect magical

little creatures called Pokemons in an endless series of violent

contests. In the real world, kids collect Pokemon trading cards. TV4

appealed, and the Swedish Market Court in Stockholm ruled against the

station.



<p>Despite the victory, the ombudsman's office expects it will keep busy.

"We're going to see more of this," says Swedish Deputy Consumer

Ombudsman Marianne Abyhammar, referring to cross-border broadcasts and

growing use of the Internet with a touch of resignation. "This is the

world we live in."
