SHISHMAREF, Alaska<wbr>--<wbr>As world leaders debate the possibility of global warming and its

uncertain threat to the future, the reality of climate change has closed

in on this small Eskimo village on the Chukchi Sea--to be precise, on a

rusty fuel tank farm holding 80,000 gallons of gasoline and stove oil.

<p>

Several years ago, the tanks were more than 300 feet from the edge of

a seaside bluff. But years of retreating sea ice have sent storm waters

pounding, and today just 35 feet of fine sandy bluff stands between the

tanks and disaster.

<p>

The airport runway--the only way to haul in wintertime food and

supplies from Anchorage, 625 miles away--has seawater lapping near its

flank. Seven houses have been relocated so far, three others have fallen

into the swirling drink and engineers now say the entire village of 600

residents could disappear into the sea within the next few decades.

<p>

Sen. Ted Stevens (R-Alaska), who is trying to get millions of dollars

in federal aid to help, blames the problem on cyclical changes in ocean

temperature. But in Alaska, where receding glaciers, melting permafrost

and advancing forests have placed the state on the front lines of climate

change, many scoff at that.

<p>

Since the 1970s, Shishmaref residents have seen their drinking water

inundated with advancing seawater, an ocean ice pack that melts earlier

each year, unusual tides and difficulty hunting ice-bound sea creatures,

such as seals and walruses.

<p>

"We've been here since before Jesus, and there was no global warming

then. Everything was good. The tides were good. And now the sea level is

coming up," Shishmaref Mayor Daniel Iyatunguk said. "You can't talk to

the ocean and tell him, 'You're a loser.' Because it's got more power, I

guess, than we've got in our heads."

<p>

At a time when the issue of global warming is sparking international

conflicts for the Bush administration, towns such as Shishmaref and

others on Alaska's coast are dealing with what many believe are the early

heralds of climate change.

<p>

The Malaspina and Seward glaciers, at the top of the Alaskan

panhandle, shrank 15 cubic miles of water since the early '70s--the

equivalent of a month's worth of water from Canada's largest river

system. The Harding Ice Field on the Kenai Peninsula has receded 85 feet

over the last 40 years, along with many glaciers on Prince William Sound.

<p>

In many areas of interior Alaska, the permafrost has warmed to within

1 degree of freezing--a phenomenon that could threaten everything from

roads and houses to the trans-Alaska oil pipeline built atop it--and

residents near the Arctic Circle say spruce forests and shrubs have been

steadily advancing northward into the once-frozen tundra, apparently

affecting such things as caribou migration patterns.

<p>

Even the Northwest Passage--the fabled Arctic sea route linking the

Atlantic to the North Pacific across the top of Canada and Alaska--has

become somewhat passable in recent years, so much so that occasional

ice-breaker cruise ships have made the transit over the last few summers.

<b><br>

<p>

Temperatures Up Over Last 30 Years

</b>

<p>

Gunter Weller, director of the Center for Global Change and Arctic

System Research at the University of Alaska in Fairbanks, said mean

temperatures in the state have increased by 5 degrees in the summer and

10 degrees in the winter over the last 30 years. Moreover, the Arctic ice

field has shrunk by 40% to 50% over the last few decades and lost 10% of

its thickness, studies show.

<p>

"These are pretty large signals, and they've had an effect on the

entire physical environment," Weller said.

<p>

"The only question is, is it man-made? Is it the greenhouse effect? Or

is it natural variability? I think the consensus in the scientific

community almost certainly is that it is both," Weller said. "Certainly,

we can't ignore factors like solar variability. But there is no question,

I think, in anybody's mind left that there's an anthropogenic effect due

to the greenhouse effect. How much is it? Is it 50%? More? We don't know,

but it's significant."

<p>

As the political debate over the Kyoto Protocol climate treaty unfolds

in Washington, D.C., Europe and Asia, rural residents in Alaska already

are seeing the effects of a changing climate all around them.

<p>

Global warming is a phenomenon caused by increasing concentrations of

certain gases in the Earth's atmosphere, including carbon dioxide,

methane, nitrous oxides and water vapor. The gases trap solar heat,

causing surface temperatures to rise over time.

<p>

In 1998, former Greenpeace climate campaigner Dan Ritzman traveled to

eight native villages on the Bering and Chukchi seas to interview

residents about what they saw happening to the weather.

<p>

"The western Arctic is warming faster than any other place on the

planet, so we wanted to look at the impacts. The feeling is that the

people who live out there are the canary in the coal mine for global

warming," Ritzman said.

<p>

"In each village, I'd say between 40 and 60 people would come to these

meetings. We'd give our presentation and ask for more information. They

were a little leery at first, and things would start out slow. And then

people would start raising their hands. They all reported changes in the

sea ice, that it would come later and leave sooner and be more unstable

all winter," he said.

<p>

"One of the funny things was, in the first village, we went to Gambell

on St. Lawrence Island, and somebody raised their hand and said, 'The

bumblebees are a lot bigger.' We all kind of chuckled and looked at each

other. Then we went to Savoonga and partway through that meeting,

somebody said, 'Oh, and the bumblebees are bigger.' Probably in seven of

the eight villages we heard something about the bumblebees being larger."

<p>

In Shishmaref and other villages along the Chukchi coast, the threat

is much more substantial.

<p>

In these remote towns, where steak costs $22 a pound at the market and

villagers rely on sea mammals for survival, sea ice that is unstable all

winter long and early to retreat in the spring means walrus and seal

hunters can no longer rely on snowmobiles to hunt on the pack ice.

<p>

In Shishmaref this month, hunters are launching their 22-foot

plywood-and-fiberglass boats 100 to 200 miles from town in search of

walruses and have had to use boats even closer to shore for seal hunting

that would normally be done more cheaply by snow machine.

<p>

"This year the ice was thinner, and most of the year at least part of

the ice was open. We don't normally see open water in December," said

Edwin Weyiouanna, an artist who has lived most of his life on the Chukchi

Sea.

<p>

The biggest effect, however, has been the unusually brutal storms the

Chukchi has been able to muster in the fall, when sea ice would normally

halt wave action against the shore. Coastal villages up and down the

Chukchi and Beaufort seas, including Barrow, Kivalina and Point Hope, all

are experiencing serious erosion.

<b><br>

<p>

8 Feet of Bluff Lost to High Tide

</b>

<p>

Shishmaref, built on a narrow barrier island off the Seward Peninsula,

has been victimized by unusually high wave and tide action and the

melting of permafrost that underlies its ocean bluffs. Now there is

seawater within 8 feet of its main road and dangerously close to homes,

utility lines, the fuel storage tanks and the town dump--which, if

inundated, could pollute the nearby marine environment for years.

<p>

A succession of sea walls has been demolished by the sea, and town

leaders say there is no longer any safe place to relocate threatened

houses. Near the airport, the island is now barely half a mile wide.

<p>

"This fall we had 28-mile-an-hour winds, which is normal for us during

the fall. But during a high tide we lost 8 feet of bluff," said Richard

Kuzuguk. "And every full moon is a high tide."

<p>

Iyatunguk, the mayor, is resigned. "I guess the whole town will have

to go. They figure we shouldn't last more than 30 to 50 years. They

figure most of it will be underwater by then."

<p>

In the short term, town leaders are seeking help from the U.S. Army

Corps of Engineers to build a stronger sea wall and, perhaps, a groin

field that would help replenish sand. Next, they will seek help from the

state transportation department to protect the runway.

<b><br>

<p>

Not Enough Space for Full Relocation

</b>

<p>

But simply moving the town, at some point, seems inevitable.

<p>

"If a good, strong wave action were to hit Shishmaref, and I think

we're due for a major storm, Shishmaref is in imminent danger. It could

really flood the whole community," said Robert Iyatunguk, co-coordinator

of the local erosion commission. "If the weather service gives us advance

warning, we might have time enough to move some of the high-risk houses.

But it's just like playing Monopoly. You're juggling houses around, and

we don't have enough ground to move them to."

<p>

Town leaders don't mind moving the town--as long as it's not far. They

have identified a potential site on the mainland about 22 miles away that

would still allow them to use what's left of the original town site as a

base camp for seal hunting.

<p>

But such an enterprise could easily cost tens of millions of dollars.

They fear they will be forced to move onto the outskirts of a large town,

such as Nome or Kotzebue, a death knell for their culture as a community.

<p>

"We know this area. We know where to hunt, we know where to pick

berries, we know where to fish. We can't move to another town," said

Daniel Iyatunguk, the mayor. "Nome told us, 'Move to Nome.' Well, no. The

lifestyle of Nome is not for us."

<p>

"Personally, I'm scared to death about moving to Nome or Kotzebue. I'd

hate to see that happen to my kids," Kuzuguk said.

<p>

So they wait for the next storm and try to figure out where they can

move the next few houses most threatened by the ravenous waves.

<p>

"It looks like we're going to have to move a couple more real soon,"

said Wayne Mundy, director of the Bering Straits Regional Housing

Authority. "The problem is, where do you move them to? Floats? Pontoons?"
