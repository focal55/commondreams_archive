WASHINGTON  - Environmentalists say they are

encouraged by progress toward finalizing implementation of the

Kyoto Protocol on climate change at ongoing talks in Morocco -

despite the lack of participation by the world's largest emitter

of greenhouse gases.  

<P>

The United States is merely observing negotiations due to end Nov.

9 in Marrakesh but the European Union (EU), Japan, and other

countries ''are moving forward,'' says Jennifer Morgan, climate

change program director at the <a href="http://www.worldwildlife.org/" target="_new">World Wildlife Fund</a>. These

countries are drafting domestic legislation to ratify and

implement the 1997 treaty, she adds. 

<P>

The Kyoto Protocol, named after the Japanese city where it was

drawn up, calls for the 38 industrialized nations to reduce, by

2012, their combined annual greenhouse gas emissions to an average

of 5.2 percent below their 1990 levels. 

<P>

President George W. Bush has refused to support the treaty,

calling it unfair because it does not require developing nations

to commit to binding reduction targets. 

<P>

The European Commission, however, is calling on member states to

ratify the Protocol by mid-June 2002, in time to commemorate the

tenth anniversary of the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, where a

voluntary version of the Protocol was first drafted. 

<P>

Countries now are negotiating brass-tacks issues including how

compliance with the treaty's legally binding rules will be

monitored and enforced. ''That system will form the fundamental

building blocks of the Kyoto Protocol,'' says Ram Uppuluri, an

attorney with <a href="http://www.edf.org/" target="_new">Environmental Defense</a>, an advocacy group based here. 

<P>

Negotiators also are discussing the mandate and regional make-up

of the executive board that would oversee the accord. 

<P>

''We're encouraged by the parties' determination to get things

done,'' says Nathalie Eddy, a climate campaigner with <a href="http://www.greenpeace.org" target="_new">Greenpeace

International</a>. 

<P>

WWF's Morgan, however, acknowledges that despite their optimism,

environmentalists are keeping a close watch on Russia, Japan and

Canada to make sure they do not ''back-track'' on commitments to

push through with the process. 

<P>

Substantial differences persist, she says. Russia, for example,

has said it must get additional credit for maintaining its vast

forests - a natural sink for the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide -

if it is to support the treaty; Germany opposes this. 

<P>

At least 55 nations, including countries that account for at least

55 percent of the industrialized world's 1990 level of carbon

dioxide emissions, must ratify the agreement for it to be become

binding. Without U.S. participation, ratification hinges on

Russian and Japanese support. 

<P>

Japan has said that it wants to see the agreement enter into force

by 2002 but its position on ratification remains unclear since it

had insisted this would only happen if the United States also went

along. Tokyo is staying in the game thanks to strong Japanese

public support for the treaty, say environmentalists. 

<P>

Even if the treaty is ratified, greenhouse gas emissions actually

could rise 2.5 percent by 2010 if the Washington remains on the

sidelines, according to Greenpeace International. This is because

the United States, which accounts for 4.6 percent of the world's

population, produces about one-fourth of all emissions. 

<P>

The irony of the treaty, adds Alden Meyer, director of government

relations at the <a href="http://www.ucsusa.org" target="_new">Union of Concerned Scientists</a>, is that the United

States strongly influenced the shape of the Protocol. The Clinton

administration insisted, for example, that it include a scheme to

allow countries to trade emissions allowances. 

<P>

Meyer says he believes that nations involved in the current talks

are trying to avoid decisions that would thwart future

participation by Washington. 

<P>

With high-level ministerial negotiations scheduled for the coming

week, Uppuluri at Environmental Defense says the Marrakesh round

of talks will only be deemed successful ''if it paves the way for

ratification.''</p>
