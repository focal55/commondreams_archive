Australia's 135,000 square mile Great Barrier Reef is under more stress than ever before, according to scientists and conservationists - with parts of it being poisoned to death. 

<P>The world heritage listed Great Barrier Reef Marine Park's inshore reefs and sea grass meadows are being choked by a lethal chemical cocktail gushing from Queensland's rivers.  

<P>The reef's Marine Park Authority and Co-operative Research Center (CRC) agree they are facing a 'one minute to midnight situation'.  

<P>Deputy chief executive of the CRC Dr David Williams said there was 'considerable concern' for both the reefs and sea grass meadows around major tourist hotspots.  

<P>Tourism linked to the world's largest coral reef complex contributes &#163;500 million to the Australian economy each year.  

<P>Sediment is flooding down rivers on to the reef and silting the waters, blocking out sunlight and preventing photosynthesis. There are accounts of reefs completely disappearing under tons of sediment.  

<P>With the sediment comes an even greater threat - pesticides and herbicides from intensive farming.  

<P>'Significant levels of the herbicide diuron, used extensively in cropping, have been found in sea grass at the mouths of some rivers between Cairns and Townsville. This can make sea grasses very sick or kill them,' said Williams.  

<P>When big weather systems such as cyclones blow through the area, as they do regularly, pollution can be carried into the outer reefs.  

<P>Most alarming is the precipitous drop in the number of dugongs, marine mammals also known as sea cows. The conservation body WWF Australia said dugong numbers had halved in eight years in the park's southern region; in some areas, the decline was as high as 80 per cent.  

<P>WWF will release a report this week showing that 16 per cent of the dugongs died from disease and more than half from unknown causes. Many scientists are linking the decline to the destruction of their main food source, sea grass.  

<P>The WWF report says 38 million tons of sediment are released on to the reef each year, and about 70 per cent of freshwater coastal wetlands in the northern 'wet tropics' region have already been lost.  

<P>WWF's Great Barrier Reef campaign manager, Imogen Zethoven, said: 'Along many parts of the coastline the water is often thick and brown like a muddy milkshake.'  

<P>The reef is also being eroded by an outbreak of the crown of thorns starfish and there is evidence to link that, too, with polluted run-off from the land. Williams said: 'The normal amount of phyto-plankton in reef waters is not enough to support crown of thorns larvae so there must be some diet enhancement going on. There is now stronger evidence that there could be a link between this and the run-off.'  

<P>Farmers say they are reducing sediment run-off and chemical pollution. Williams acknowledged improvements were under way but said more needed to be done. 'If stronger action is not taken to further reduce run-off of sediment, nutrients and biocides, the present precarious situation for these habitats will worsen, perhaps catastrophically,' he said.
