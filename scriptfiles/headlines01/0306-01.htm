Advances in renewable and energy-
efficient
technology
combined with the willingness of governments to experiment with
new economic
approaches to energy markets, can significantly cut greenhouse
emissions at
little cost, according to a new analysis released Monday by an
international
panel of hundreds of scientists.
<P>
The 800-page report, released in Accra, Ghana during an
international meeting
on how to mitigate global warming, says that efforts to stem heat-
trapping
greenhouse gas emissions caused by the burning of oil, gas and
coal can result
in additional benefits including less air pollution, forest
conservation and
energy security. <P>
The report is the third in a series of three large documents by
the
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and represents almost
three years
of work by about 400 governmental and non-government experts. <P>
While the report stresses that there is no single path to reducing
emissions,
the panel says that if currently available technological
innovations in
renewable energy and energy efficiency are promoted by
governments, carbon
dioxide emissions could be significantly reduced within the next
100 years. <P>
Significant technological advances in renewable energy, such as
wind turbines
and fuel efficient hybrid engine cars, have progressed faster than
anticipated,
it says. <P>
In various mitigation scenarios studied by the panel, no single
technology
option provides all of the emissions reductions needed. A
combination of
market
incentives and technologies is the most effective, says the
summary. <P>
According to another report released in Accra last week by the
United Nations
Environment Programme (UNEP), geothermal, small-scale hydro-power,
solar,
biomass, and wind technologies have grown proportionally faster
than any other
electricity supply technology. <P>
The wind energy industry, for example, has grown in just two
decades from a
producer of small machines to a modern, multi-billion dollar
industry
supplying
bulk, grid-connected power, says Klaus Toepfer, executive director
of UNEP. <P>
Since the 1990s the cost of wind generated electricity has dropped
seven-fold,
which makes wind power competitive with most fossil fuel
technologies, he
says. <P>
''It is increasingly true,'' says Toepfer, ''that there are no
technical,
financial or economic reasons why the nations of the world cannot
enjoy the
benefits of a high level of energy services and a better
environment.'' <P>
''It is simply a question of making the right choices,'' he says. <P>
One of the right choices, according to the report by the
scientific panel, is
to remove government subsidies for fossil fuels and instead devote
them to
renewable energy and energy efficiency. <P>
The report also says the use of various market mechanisms, such as
emission
trading permits, could reduce the net economic cost of meeting
emissions
reduction targets under the Kyoto Protocol. <P>
The international treaty, named after the Japanese city where it
was drawn up
in 1997, requires industrialised nations to cut their greenhouse
gas emissions
by 2012 to five percent below 1990 levels.  <P>
While more than 100 countries have signed the agreement, not one
industrialised
nation has ratified the treaty. <P>
The report says the most effective way a country could meet its
treaty
obligations would be to develop several policy instruments,
including tradable
or non-tradable emission permits, energy mix requirements, energy
efficiency
standards, support for research and development, and the
redirection of energy
subsidies. <P>
''Market-based instruments may be cost effective in many cases,
especially
where capacity to administer them is developed,'' says the report
summary. The
report also says the transfer of technologies between countries
and regions
will ''widen the choice of options at the regional level and
economies of
scale
and learning will lower the costs of their adoption''. <P>
Preserving forests, which store carbon dioxide, is another way
governments can
mitigate global warming, says the report. Promoting agricultural
practices
that
emit less carbon from the soil, such as no-till farming, is also a
method
policy makers can utilise to foster reductions in greenhouse
gases, it says. <P>
The report says some government proposals to implement a carbon
tax can have
negative income effects on low-income groups ''unless the tax
revenues are
used
directly or indirectly to compensate such effect''. <P>
Some mitigation actions may yield extensive benefits in areas
outside of
climate change, says the panel's report. <P>
''For example, they may reduce health problems; increase
employment; reduce
negative environmental impacts (like air pollution); protect and
enhance
forests, soils and watersheds; reduce those subsidies and taxes
which enhance
greenhouse gas emissions; and induce technological change ...
contributing to
wide goals of sustainable development,'' says the summary. <P>
The first report by the scientific panel, issued in January,
concluded that
carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping greenhouse gases is causing
the gradual
rise of the Earth's air surface temperature. <P>
The panel predicted that the average surface air temperature of
the planet
will
rise 1.4 to 5.8 degrees Celsius by the year 2100 relative to 1990.
Average sea
level, worldwide is projected by models to rise 0.09 to 0.88
metres by 2100. <P>
The panel's second report warned that global warming is already
seriously
impacting ecosystems worldwide and will further widen the gap
between
industrialised nations and poor developing countries which are
particularly
vulnerable to extreme weather events. <P>
Observational evidence indicates, said the panel, that regional
changes in
climate, particularly increases in temperature, are currently
causing glaciers
to shrink, permafrost to thaw and wildlife behaviour to change.
