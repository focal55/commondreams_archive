The talk on Thursday of an accord in Kandahar means little to Rukia. She has given up on peace in Afghanistan.

<p>   She has five reasons, one for each of her dead children.</p>

<p>  Rukia, 39, who like many Afghans uses only one name, lost her family five days ago when she says a United States bomb hit her Kandahar neighborhood. Wounded in the stomach and with her left arm shattered, she had to flee before she could bury her children.</p>

<p>   She was nearly bombed again, while a relative was driving her to a hospital in Pakistan</p>

<p>   "They're bombing anything that moves," she said. "It's not true that they bomb civilians by accident. They're targeting the innocent people instead of Osama bin Laden."</p>

<p>   US officials have said that they are doing everything possible to minimize civilian casualties as warplanes continue to pound Taliban and al-Qaeda positions in Kandahar and in the mountains near Jalalabad.</p>

<p>   But accidents happen, evident earlier this week when three US servicemen died and 20 were injured near Kandahar when a "smart" bomb from a B-52 went awry. Six allied Afghan fighters also were killed and 17 injured.</p>

<p>   The international aid agency M&#233;dicins sans Fronti&#232;res (Doctors Without Borders) said on Wednesday that its workers picked up more than  80 dead in villages of eastern Afghanistan, near Jalalabad, heavily bombed by US planes.</p>

<p>  The civilian toll is difficult to gauge because of the Muslim custom to quickly bury the dead, international aid workers say.</p>

<p>      What is clear in the Sandeman Provincial Hospital in Quetta, near the Afghan border, are the raw emotions and anger directed at the US.</p>

<p>   Rukia covered her face and started to cry when asked what she wanted to tell the Americans about the loss of her five children. She thought a while before responding: "Destroy, finish, terminate America."</p>

<p>   "It is our wish - the elders, the women, the children - to have peace, but it is impossible. First we had the war with Russia, then the Taliban came and now the United States attacking us again and again," she said.</p>

<p>   Rukia shares a hospital room with a 10-year-old girl who lost half her leg in a US bombing attack. In another room, another Kandahar victim, Abdul Qadir, 33, writhes in pain with stomach wounds from bomb shrapnel.</p>

<p>   "I'm very angry against America," said his brother, Rahmat Ullah, 28. "What was his fault? He was an innocent man working in his shop."</p>
