On the streets of Egypt, 20,000 students shout "US Go to Hell!" On  the streets of Jakarta, separatist Muslims threaten to kill the American  ambassador and destroy the embassy, screaming: "Americans are terrorists,  Kill them all!" On the streets of Pakistan, Jordan, South Africa, Iran  and Bangladesh, outraged Muslims protest, sometimes violently, sometimes  peacefully.

<p>"How do I respond when I see that in some Islamic countries there is  vitriolic hatred for America?" United States President George Bush asked during a media conference  yesterday. "I'll tell you how I respond: I'm amazed. I just can't  believe it because I know how good we are."</p>

<p>Could it be that the  Secretary of State, Colin Powell, has not told his boss about the resentment of US power, especially in  the Middle East, even among those who deplore the attacks of  September 11?</p>

<p> Is he unaware of the long-standing protests of friendly  countries such as Egypt and Jordan about America's pro-Israeli policies and  the simmering anger over sanctions against Iraq which the United Nations says  have contributed to hundreds of thousands of deaths?</p>

<p>In his media conference, Mr Bush's admission that he viewed the protests  with disbelief was arguably the most crucial revelation. If the President  does not understand Muslim anger, or will not discuss it openly with the  American people, where will his war against "evildoers" end up?</p>

<p>One of America's closest friends in the Middle East, Saudi Arabia, has  refused to freeze assets of suspected terrorist Osama bin Laden because of the royal family's fears for its  own survival against an Islamic uprising. <I>The New York Times</I> reported that  the rulers of Saudi Arabia have also upset the Bush Administration because  of its reluctance to fully investigate the hijacking suspects, at least six  of whom obtained US visas in Saudi Arabia. Of the 19 countries the US has  announced have frozen assets of terrorist organizations, Egypt, Kuwait,  Qatar, Jordan and Saudi Arabia were noticeably absent.</p>

<p>Yesterday, Saudi prince Alwaleed bin Talal was in New York touring the  rubble of what was once the World Trade Center, and offering a $US10 million  donation. New York mayor Rudolph Giuliani rejected it after the prince said  the US "should  re-examine its policies in the Middle East and adopt a  more balanced stance toward the Palestinian cause. Our Palestinian brethren  continue to be slaughtered at the hands of Israelis while the world turns  the other cheek." For the US, the struggle is between good and evil, and  nothing else. "We [are not fighting] a war against Islam or Muslims," said  Mr Bush."We're fighting evil.''</p>

<p> Martin Indyk, the former US ambassador to Israel, pointed out this week that  the positions of Middle Eastern states are the reverse of what they were  during Gulf War in 1991, in which a US-led coalition ousted Iraq  from Kuwait. Then, Jordan and the Palestinian Authority opposed the US; now,  they strong supporters. Then, Saudi Arabia and Egypt backed the US; now,  they are mostly silent.</p>

<p>"What this reflects is that Jordan and the  Palestinian authority are too weak to avoid the choice of us and Osama  bin Laden, whereas Egypt and Saudi Arabia are too scared to make that  choice. Their silence signals their fear to their own public," Mr Indyk said. </p>

<p>The  difference was that Iraq threatened the Arab order. Now, bin  Laden's real targets are Arab regimes themselves.</p>

<p>Mr Indyk's view is that the predicament is an Arab problem, and one that the US  should press. "What we need them to do is to get up their courage, stand  up and lead their people," he said.</p>

<p>But others say the US has a profound public relations problem in the Middle  East that it is failing to address.</p>

<p> Every day this week, missiles  have obliterated the Taliban regime's military infrastructure and  communications networks in Afghanistan, and each day, individual packages of  food were dropped for the starving Afghan people. Yesterday, Mr Bush  announced another initiative aides said was his own idea.  Each American  child, he said, should give or earn one dollar for the starving children of Afghanistan  and send the money directly to the White House. "One of the truest  weapons that we have against terrorism is to show the world the true  strength of character and kindness of the American people," he said.  "Americans are united in this fight against terrorism. We're also united  in our concern for the innocent people of Afghanistan.''</p>

<p>Political analyst William Saletan, writing in the online magazine <I>Slate</I>,  insisted that the US needs to move beyond gestures and directly answer  American critics in the Middle East, specifically bin Laden's justifications  for the September 11 attacks.  Bin  Laden, who Mr Bush called "the evil one", presented point by point the  Muslim world's indictment of America, which, however cynical, struck a  chord among many Arab and Muslim people.</p>

<p>In the video, bin Laden says " a million innocent children are dying ... in Iraq" because of US-imposed sanctions  following the Gulf War. "Israeli tanks rampage against Palestine."  The  6,000 people killed in the terrorist strikes were not innocent  victims but American, who were "killers who have abused the blood ...of Muslims". The nations that support the US in the  declared war on terrorism were "hypocrites", sell-outs to the West,  and not true Muslims.</p>

<p>"The White House seems to think that if it ignores bin Laden's message,  the message will go away," said Mr Saletan. "In the war for Muslim  public opinion, we've become pacifists.''</p>

<p>The British Prime Minister, Tony Blair, noted the same problem while  traveling through the Middle East this week. "One thing becoming  increasingly clear to me is the need to upgrade our media and public opinion  operations in the Arab and Muslim world."</p>

<p>The problem will become more acute as the struggle against terrorism moves  beyond al-Qaeda, the loose network the US blames for the terrorist  attacks, and the Taliban regime, which is financed by bin Laden, and has  refused to hand him over for trial. Mr Blair said the fight to "root out terrorism where it may exist  all around the world" would be sustained and  relentless.</p>

<p>James Lindsay, a former US foreign affairs adviser, says that it is clear that there is an  "Afghanistan-first strategy, but not an Afghanistan-only policy". So  far, the Bush Administration has put aside the argument made by Deputy  Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz that the US  should oust Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, but few believe the issue is  resolved.</p>

<p>There is great regret in the Republican Party that Mr Bush's father, President George Bush Sr, failed  to deal with Saddam after the Gulf War, and contempt for the Clinton  administration's "containment plus regime change" policy. There have  been no weapons inspections in Iraq since 1998, and America's enforcement of  a "no-fly" zone, and its continuing economic sanctions,  have failed to eliminate Saddam's grip on power.</p>

<p>Iraq accuses the US of seeking to use the terrorist strike to settle "old  scores". </p>

<p>Washington's letter to the UN on Sunday  stating that it reserved the right to take military action against nations  other than Afghanistan alarmed countries in the Middle East, as well as  allies such as Britain.</p>

<p>The problem with Iraq, which is believed to be developing chemical and  biological weapons, is that there is no evidence linking it to the September  11 attacks bar a meeting between hijacker Mohamed Atta and an Iraqi  intelligence official in June last year. That information was leaked to the  media by the Pentagon, which this week reportedly asked former CIA director  James Woolsey to look for proof justifying an attack on Iraq. The fatal  case of anthrax in Florida has only increased suspicions that Iraq was  involved.</p>

<p>"I wish we could find a connection, but we have not," a senior  official in Jordan told <I>The New York Times</I>. An Israeli intelligence expert  said he was "sure Saddam Hussein is very happy, but not more than  that".</p>

<p>The British Foreign Secretary, Jack Straw, denies a split with the US over  widening the military campaign beyond Afghanistan, which he said was not  "on the agenda at present". To date, Mr Powell's view that a  precipitous attack against Iraq would "wreck" the coalition against terrorism has prevailed so far, at least without  firm proof of an Iraq-al-Qaeda connection. Yet Mr Bush was equivocal when directly asked about Saddam.  "We're watching him, very carefully," he said. </p>

<p>In the US, Iraq  is a special case. There is evidence that elements within  Saudi Arabia and Iran have directly funded al-Qaeda, yet there is  no serious discussion in Washington about military action in those counties.</p>

<p>Mr Lindsay says that if there is evidence linking Saddam with al-Qaeda,  particularly evidence that Iraq gave the organization biological or chemical  weapons, the US will take military  action. </p>

<p>Patrick Clawson, of Washington Institute for  Near East Policy, says the issue has less to do with the terrorist strikes than  with Iraq's "horrific capabilities " with biological and chemical  weapons.</p>

<p>"An awful lot of the governments in the region in the Gulf think  Saddam is a really big problem and should go away but they're not convinced  the US has the stick-to-it-ness," he said.</p>
