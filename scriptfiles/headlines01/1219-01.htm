There's not much to mark the place -- a steel gate topped with 

stylized silhouettes of ducks, a metal sign engraved with the legend, "Casa de 

Patos." A driveway wends through a grove of oaks. Rice fields stretch to the 

west, and a thick woodland jungle hugs Butte Creek, the eastern border of the 

property.

<P>Locals know this 1,550-acre expanse of marsh and cropland owned by 

stockbroker Charles Schwab as one of the finest duck clubs in the Sacramento 

Valley.

<P>True, Schwab raises rice on his property, but his primary reason for 

ownership is duck and goose hunting. He and his guests shoot over the 

property's permanent wetlands and seasonally flooded rice fields just north of 

the Butte Sink, a prime area for migratory waterfowl.

<P>But Schwab -- whose net worth is estimated to be $4 billion -- doesn't have 

to foot the entire bill for Casa de Patos. He gets plenty of financial help in 

the pursuit of his sport. Last year, he and his family received $564,000 in 

federal price supports for rice.

<P>Subsidies for agricultural commodities -- rice, cotton, corn, wheat and 

soybeans -- long have been a staple of the federal farm bill, which is adopted 

at multiyear intervals.

</p>

<b>CLOSER SCRUTINY OF SUBSIDIES</b>

<P>But as Congress debates this year's farm bill -- a behemoth piece of 

legislation involving expenditures of $170 billion -- commodity payments are 

engendering increasing controversy, especially when the recipients, like 

Schwab, are rich.

<P>Although such subsidies are made in the name of family farms, small farms 

are not their main recipients. In fact, financial tycoons and Fortune 500 

corporations reap bales of cash from farm programs. Payments go to farmers 

residing in such unlikely places as Aspen and Atherton.

<P>Critics of the crop subsidy structure say Schwab is a textbook example of 

what is wrong with the system.

<P>"There are plenty of family farmers who are struggling and need help in 

California," said Susanne Fleek, director of government relations for the 

Environmental Working Group, a Washington, D.C., group that has compiled 

individual subsidy data for the first time.

<P>"But Charles Schwab is not among them," Fleek said. "I doubt anyone would 

even call him a farmer. The payments to Schwab are doing nothing to keep land 

in agricultural production, and that mocks one of the basic tenets of the 

subsidy program."

<P>A Schwab spokesman said Schwab declined to comment.

<P>Supporters of U.S. farm policy counter that the commodity subsidy programs 

are necessary to keep land in production, farmers working, food prices low and 

rural communities healthy.

<P>While California is the nation's biggest agricultural producer, most of the 

crop subsidies go to Midwest grain farmers. Only 9 percent of California's 

farmers, mainly large Central Valley cotton and rice growers, get crop 

subsidies.

</p>

<b>RICE PAYS TWICE</b>

<P>Like most of California's 2,500 rice farmers, Schwab gets his rice money 

from two different U.S. Department of Agriculture programs.

<P>The first pays a subsidy based on production: The more rice produced, the 

greater the payment. The second program makes up the difference between the 

loan a farmer typically takes out each year to plant a crop and the price 

received for a crop.

<P>The programs assure that Schwab's rice will always be sold at a profit. 

Essentially, his crop is insured by the government -- at zero cost.

<P>Criticism of the current crop subsidy structure is coming from the right as 

well as the left. "Cases like (Schwab's) are representative of the problem in 

a nutshell," said Cena Swisher, a senior program director for Taxpayers for 

Common Sense, a Washington, D.C., budget watchdog group.

<P>"Study after study proves that these commodity payments go to large 

corporate farms," Swisher said. "You end up with people like Mr. Schwab, 

people who don't need the money, asking the taxpayer to beef up their bottom 

line -- or help them hunt ducks."

<P>But rice industry advocates, government farm service agents and even many 

environmentalists contend that there is great public benefit to promoting rice 

cultivation in the northern Sacramento Valley -- regardless of who receives 

the subsidies.

<P>Rice culture is essential to the region's economic and social fabric, said 

Donald Perez, the executive director for the Glenn County office of the 

federal Farm Service Agency in Willows. The agency issues federal commodity 

payment checks to eligible growers.

<P>"What do you have in Glenn County?" asked Perez. "In Willows, you have 

government -- county, state and federal -- and businesses that support 

agriculture. In the rest of the county, you have rice. That's it. Without rice 

supports, this entire area would depopulate."

<P></p>

<b>ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS</b>

<P>Federal rice subsidies have also had tremendous environmental benefit, 

supporters argue.

<P>"Ten or 15 years ago, the Sacramento Valley held about 3 million 

overwintering waterfowl," said Tim Johnson, the president of the California 

Rice Commission. "Now the number of birds have more than doubled, and that's 

because of rice."

<P>Most rice fields were burned after harvest to destroy the stubble. But 

clean air regulations changed that -- now they're flooded. The flooded fields 

constitute a tremendous habitat for migratory waterfowl, which feed on 

leftover grain and aquatic invertebrates.

<P>"What you end up with are thousands of acres of seasonal wetlands," Johnson 

said. "That's a terrific benefit to all kinds of wildlife -- not just ducks 

and geese."

<P>Environmentalists acknowledge the wildlife benefits of rice planting but 

say there must be greater equity in the way federal farm subsidies are 

distributed.

<P>"When we're spending $20 billion a year in public dollars on these programs,

<P>it's absolutely necessary we make sure the money is going to the people who 

need it the most," said Fleek, of the Environmental Working Group. "We do not 

see why it's necessary to give Charles Schwab these payments, when they 

obviously aren't necessary to keep him farming."

<P>Perez, of the Farm Service Agency, said that the question of commodity 

payment eligibility is a legitimate one -- and that it is also beyond the 

purview of the Farm Service Agency.

<P>"That's decided at the congressional level," he said. "If you want to put a 

new means test to eligibility, you can -- you can make a case for it either 

way. But right now, if you grow rice, you're entitled to the payments. It 

doesn't matter who you are."
