            Citizens of the four largest West European countries disapprove of 

            President George W. Bush's handling of international policy by wide 

            margins, according to a new opinion survey.

            <div style="visibility:hidden">.</div>

            The Europeans object in particular to the U.S. president's positions 

            on global warming and missile defense. They express only slightly 

            more confidence in him than in President Vladimir Putin of Russia.

            <div style="visibility:hidden">.</div>

            Overwhelming majorities of Europeans in the poll describe Mr. Bush 

            as a unilateralist, concerned only with U.S. interests. By margins 

            of 3 to 1 or more, they say he understands Europe less well than earlier 

            American presidents.

            <div style="visibility:hidden">.</div>

            The poll, the first big multicountry opinion survey of reaction to 

            Mr. Bush's foreign policy, was conducted this month in Britain, France, 

            Germany and Italy by the International Herald Tribune in collaboration 

            with the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press, a nonpartisan 

            U.S. polling group, and in association with the U.S. Council on Foreign 

            Relations. A poll including many of the same questions was conducted 

            in the United States, as well, to compare American and European responses.

            <div style="visibility:hidden">.</div>

            The results demonstrate the substantial challenges facing the new 

            U.S. administration as it seeks to move ahead on thorny and complex 

            international issues such as environmental protection and arms control.

            <div style="visibility:hidden">.</div>

            &quot;This administration, and the Bush campaign that preceded it, 

            have been very explicit about pursuing American interests in a narrow 

            sense,&quot; said Dana Allin, a specialist in trans-Atlantic relations 

            at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London. &quot;One 

            shouldn't be surprised if European publics react badly to this kind 

            of rhetoric.&quot;

            <div style="visibility:hidden">.</div>

            The survey did, however, find strong support in Europe - in fact, 

            stronger than in the United States - for Mr. Bush's decision to keep 

            peacekeeping troops in Bosnia and Kosovo. Europeans also backed his 

            efforts to promote free trade, and only about 1 in 5 of the European 

            respondents said the basic interests of Europe and the United States 

            had grown further apart.

            <div style="visibility:hidden">.</div>

            &quot;If there is a bright light in the poll results,&quot; said Andrew 

            Kohut, director of the Pew Center, &quot;it is that most reject the 

            idea that the U.S. and Europe are drifting apart.&quot;

            <div style="visibility:hidden">.</div>

            But the Europeans' confidence in the underlying trans-Atlantic relationship 

            served to underscore the dissatisfaction with the current U.S. president 

            himself. Disapproval of Mr. Bush was strongest in Germany and France, 

            where solid majorities disliked his performance on the international 

            stage.

            <div style="visibility:hidden">.</div>

            The president fared least badly in Italy, but even there 46 percent 

            expressed disapproval, with 29 percent approving and the rest declining 

            to answer.

            <div style="visibility:hidden">.</div>

            In the United States, citizens supported Mr. Bush's international 

            policy by a margin of 45 percent to 32 percent.

            <div style="visibility:hidden">.</div>

            The Europeans gave Mr. Bush drastically lower approval ratings than 

            they now give his predecessor, Bill Clinton, whose support among Europeans 

            started low but rose gradually during his presidency.

            <div style="visibility:hidden">.</div>

            &quot;Any new president is likely to have a rough treatment from European 

            allies who were just getting comfortable with the old one,&quot; Mr. 

            Allin said. Mr. Clinton, he noted, &quot;was ideologically in tune 

            with the center-left governments that came to power in the major West 

            European capitals&quot; during his term.

            <div style="visibility:hidden">.</div>

            Six months into the Clinton presidency in 1993, Europeans were complaining 

            that America was showing no leadership, and that Mr. Clinton, the 

            former governor of the Southern state of Arkansas, was &quot;goofy&quot; 

            and undeserving of respect. A Tokyo Broadcasting poll in Japan found 

            that two in three Japanese said they mistrusted Mr. Clinton.

            <div style="visibility:hidden">.</div>

            The IHT/Pew poll was conducted not long after Mr. Bush completed his 

            first six months in office, when he drew considerable criticism in 

            Europe from leaders and commentators for actions that some have said 

            showed arrogant disregard by the world's dominant superpower for allied 

            views.

            <div style="visibility:hidden">.</div>

            Perhaps most salient was Mr. Bush's decision to abandon the Kyoto 

            Protocol to decrease greenhouse gas emissions, a move that prompted 

            the highly unusual decision by 178 other countries to go ahead without 

            U.S. support. Controversy has erupted as well over Mr. Bush's plan 

            to construct anti-missile defenses, even if it means withdrawing from 

            the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, and over his decisions to 

            temporarily back off from confidence-building talks with North Korea 

            and to repudiate a Clinton administration decision to sign an accord 

            to establish an International Criminal Court. The new administration 

            also has withheld support for efforts to complete or enforce a biological 

            weapons treaty, an international ban on land mines, a small-arms control 

            pact, an anti-money-laundering effort and United Nations population 

            control programs.

            <div style="visibility:hidden">.</div>

            The Europeans surveyed not only objected to Mr. Bush's policies but 

            also questioned whether he wanted to work with them to solve common 

            problems. More than 7 in 10 of those surveyed in each European country 

            said that Mr. Bush acted solely based on U.S. interests in making 

            foreign policy decisions. Asked whether Mr. Bush took Europe into 

            account, fewer than 2 in 10 in any country said that he did. On specific 

            issues, Europeans disagreed with Mr. Bush's abandonment of the Kyoto 

            Protocol on greenhouse gases by a margin of about 8 to 1. That was 

            far greater than the 44 percent of Americans who disagreed with it.

            <div style="visibility:hidden">.</div>

            Mr. Bush's support for the death penalty in the United States was 

            roundly criticized during his recent visits to Europe, and poll respondents 

            in Italy, Germany and France disapproved of his position by 2 to 1 

            or more. Britons were evenly split on the issue. On the bright side 

            for Mr. Bush, the Europeans approved by double-digit margins his free-trade 

            policies and decision to keep U.S. troops in the Balkans.

            <div style="visibility:hidden">.</div>

            On missile defense, Germans, long among the most sensitive Europeans 

            to issues of arms control, resoundingly disapproved of Mr. Bush's 

            plan to develop an anti-missile system even if it meant withdrawing 

            from the ABM Treaty. The margin was 83 percent to 10 percent.

            <div style="visibility:hidden">.</div>

            The opposition to the missile plan - which critics say could cause 

            instability in Europe and possibly a new arms race in Asia- was nearly 

            as large in Britain, France and Italy. &quot;This certainly has to 

            be a matter of concern to the president,&quot; said Robert Jervis, 

            president of the American Political Science Association, &quot;because 

            he needs cooperation and support from European leaders, and European 

            leaders are to some extent responsive to their public opinions.&quot;

            <div style="visibility:hidden">.</div>

            Mr. Jervis, a professor of international politics at Columbia University, 

            has said that much of the world sees &quot;the prime rogue state today&quot; 

            as the United States.

            <div style="visibility:hidden">.</div>

            Other analysts have been more sanguine, saying that any president's 

            first months in office are bound to be bumpy; that European leaders, 

            at least, have gradually warmed to Mr. Bush; and that he, like other 

            presidents, is likely to turn increasingly to international issues 

            and will have no choice but to seek foreign cooperation.

            <div style="visibility:hidden">.</div>

            &quot;If you look at the early European reactions to Carter, Reagan 

            and Clinton, it was all very simplistic,&quot; said Jackson Janes, 

            executive director of the American Institute for Contemporary German 

            Studies, at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. &quot;The first 

            six months is a rush to judgment,&quot; he said.

            <div style="visibility:hidden">.</div>

            Mr. Bush, moreover, retains substantial support at home on many international 

            issues.

            <div style="visibility:hidden">.</div>

            &quot;His favorable ratings on foreign policy are not bad among Americans. 

            They're slightly to the positive,&quot; said Steven Kull, director 

            of the Program on International Policy Attitudes at the University 

            of Maryland.

            <div style="visibility:hidden">.</div>

            &quot;By and large, the American public approves of Bush's handling 

            of foreign policy,&quot; said Mr. Kohut of the Pew Center.

            <div style="visibility:hidden">.</div>

            By contrast, Europeans expressed little confidence in Mr. Bush. Only 

            2 in 10 French respondents and somewhat higher proportions of British 

            (30%) and Italians (33%) said that they had a fair degree of confidence, 

            or better, in his conduct of world affairs.

            <div style="visibility:hidden">.</div>

            Germans gave Mr. Bush better marks, with just over half voicing at 

            least some confidence in his abilities. Europeans overall expressed 

            only a bit more confidence in Mr. Bush than in Mr. Putin of Russia. 

            Mr. Bush edged out Mr. Putin by margins of 4 to 10 percentage points 

            among respondents who expressed a fair degree of confidence in him, 

            or better, regarding world affairs.

            <div style="visibility:hidden">.</div>

            On the negative side of the ledger, larger numbers of Britons and 

            Italians expressed &quot;not too much&quot; confidence or &quot;none 

            at all&quot; in Mr. Bush than in Mr. Putin.

            <div style="visibility:hidden">.</div>

            The Europeans had significantly more confidence in their own national 

            leaders. For each - Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder of West Germany, 

            President Jacques Chirac of France, Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain 

            and Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi of Italy - a majority of respondents 

            in his country had a fair amount or a great deal of confidence in 

            him.

            <div style="visibility:hidden">.</div>

            Analysts emphasized that one of the central features of Europeans' 

            dissatisfaction with Mr. Bush was the sense that the United States 

            was behaving in a unilateral way.

            <div style="visibility:hidden">.</div>

            &quot;The interest in which we act is a narrower American interest 

            than was true, I believe, of previous American administrations,&quot; 

            said Mr. Jervis of Columbia University.

            <div style="visibility:hidden">.</div>

            The Bush administration has insisted that it is fully engaged with 

            its partners. Rejecting the unilateralist label affixed by critics 

            abroad and in the Democratic Party at home, a senior State Department 

            official has described the Bush approach as &quot;à la carte multilateralism.&quot; 

            A degree of unilateralism is natural for the world's only superpower, 

            Mr. Allin said. &quot;But it is a problem for Bush if a crisis erupts 

            - in the Persian Gulf or Taiwan Strait - where European views and 

            interests are ambiguous,&quot; he said. &quot;His unpopularity certainly 

            could impair his ability to line up allied support for U.S. action.&quot;

            <div style="visibility:hidden">.</div>

            Is Mr. Bush in sync with the American public on questions of unilateralism?

            <div style="visibility:hidden">.</div>

            &quot;He is somewhat out of step with the American majority,&quot; 

            Mr. Kull said. &quot;In general, the public is very pro-multilateralist, 

            and tends to favor all kinds of international cooperation.&quot;
