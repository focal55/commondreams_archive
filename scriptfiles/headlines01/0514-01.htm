BRUSSELS  - Trade restrictions imposed by rich

countries are

costing the world's poorest "a staggering 2.5 billion US dollars a

year in

lost foreign exchange earnings", Oxfam says in a report released

Monday.   

<P>

The 27-page report, 'Rigged Trade and Not Much Aid: How Rich

Countries Help

to Keep the Least Developed Countries Poor', to be presented at

the NGO

Forum, in advance of the UN Conference on Least Developed

Countries, warns

that northern governments are guilty of offering "empty promises"

to the

poor when it comes to trade, aid and debt relief.   <P>

While Least Developed Countries (LDCs) face a complex array of

problems, the

report finds that their efforts to combat poverty have been

"systematically

undermined" by northern governments. 

<P>

Oxfam Senior Policy Advisor Kevin Watkins, who will present the

report,

says: "On trade, the industrialized countries have operated a

policy of

highway robbery masquerading as market access preferences". 

<P>

United States and Canada are identified as the "worst offenders",

with

Bangladesh losing seven dollars from trade restrictions for every

one dollar

it receives in U.S. aid and five times that for every dollar it

receives

from Canada.  

<P>

"Indeed, losses associated with U.S. trade barriers are roughly

equivalent

to total U.S. Aid to the LDCs," it says. 

<P>

Trade restrictions in Canada cost LDCs an estimated 1.6 billion

dollars, or

approximately five times aid flows to the poorest countries.

Similarly,

Japanese trade restrictions cost Bangladesh more than double the

amount

Tokyo provides in aid. <P>

At a time when aid to the developing world has fallen to its

lowest level

since the early 1970s, around 11 percent of exports from LDCs face

'tariff

peaks' in excess of 15 percent, which is three times the share of

imports

affected from other countries. <P>

"In areas where they have a capacity to export, LDCs face higher

tariffs

than other countries, including developed market economies," it

says.  <P>

Average tariffs in the European Union, the United States, Canada

and Japan -

the so-called Quad countries that account for over half the

world's trade -

are relatively low, at approximately five percent.  <P>

"However, the average obscures very high tariffs in sectors of

most

relevance to poor countries. Tariffs on some agricultural products

are more

than 300 percent in the EU and, in the case of groundnuts, over

100 percent

in the U.S.," it says. <P>

While the European Union's 'Everything but Arms' proposal for

providing

duty- and quota-free access to LDCs by 2009 represents a bold step

in the

right direction, intensive lobbying resulted in key agricultural

items -

rice, sugar and beef - being removed from the proposal.  <P>

In Europe, total duty-free access would increase exports from LDCs

by 185

million dollars, with sugar accounting for over 60 percent of the

gain,

according to Oxfam's research.  <P>

But the Everything but Arms initiative was watered down into

"Everything but

Farms", says Watkins. "The clear message from Brussels to the LDCs

was that

powerful industrial lobbies come first, and poverty second."  

<P>

While the doors to northern markets remain shut, many LDC have

been

liberalizing, often under International Monetary Fund and World

Bank

auspices, at breakneck speed, notes the pressure group.  

<P>

"The results have often been disastrous. In Haiti, the

liberalization of the

rice market and subsequent surge in subsidized US imports has

destroyed

thousands of livelihoods and undermined national food security,"

says the

report. 

<P>

In such labor intensive areas as textiles, footwear, and

agriculture,

production for export growth has the potential to generate more

equitable

patterns of economic growth, "creating employment and livelihood

opportunities for highly vulnerable populations", the report

notes. 

<P>

"There are potentially powerful inter-linkages between exports and

poverty

reduction in many LDCs, through a commitment to redistribution and

to

environmental sustainability would strengthen the benefits of

trade," it

says. 

<P>

"The problem is that trade policies in industrialized countries

are

carefully designed to prevent LDCs from taking advantage of export

opportunities."  

<P>

The Oxfam report also examines the rich world's record on aid and

debt

relief.  It concludes that the rich countries' performance on aid

has been

"derisory".  

<P>

In 1990, the countries of the Organization for Economic Co-

operation and

Development (OECD) pledged to increase aid and reach a target of

0.20

percent of their GNP to the LDCs in development assistance. Since

then, they

have cut around 3.5 billion dollars from their aid flows, which

are now at

their lowest level in per capita terms since the early 1970s. 

<P>

At the same time, annual spending in OECD countries on farm

subsidies - 1

billion dollars per day - is roughly equivalent to the GDP of all

the LDCs

combined. <P>

While many LDCs are eligible for debt relief under the Heavily

Indebted Poor

Countries (HIPC) Initiative, the report says that many will emerge

in an

unsustainable debt position.  <P>

"Preliminary analysis by Oxfam suggests that at least 13 LDCs -

including

Zambia, Niger and Senegal - will emerge from the HIPC Initiative

spending

more than 10 percent of government revenue on debt," it says. 

<P>

The Oxfam report is calling for: immediate duty free and quota

free access

for LDCs in industrialized country markets; reform of the EU's

'Everything

but Arms' proposal to include immediate liberalization of LDC

access for

sugar and rice markets; an end to agricultural import

liberalization under

IMF and World Bank programs; a timetable for OECD donors to

reach the 0.20

percent of GNP aid target; and deeper levels of debt relief.
