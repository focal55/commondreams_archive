New glimpses of Earth from space show air pollution wrapping around

the planet, spreading haze and hazardous gases across oceans and

continents and posing new challenges for cleanup.

<p>The findings, beamed back to Earth from a NASA satellite in orbit for

two years, depict in dramatic fashion the global reach of air pollution.

Scientists have known for years that man-made pollutants spread far and

wide, but this is the first time they have watched it happen from space

over a long period.

<p>"Much of the air pollution that humans generate comes from natural

sources, such as large fires that travel great distances and affect areas

far from the source," said John Gille, principal investigator at the

National Center for Atmospheric Research in Colorado. "With these new

observations, you clearly see that air pollution is much more than a

local problem. It's a global issue."

<p>The findings were presented at a scientific conference in Boston on

Wednesday. Researchers from the United States and Canada are

participating in the project, one of several ongoing studies of global

air pollution.

<b><br>

<p>Emissions Influence World's Climate

</b>

<p>Increasingly, researchers are discovering air pollution is not a

transient phenomenon, here today and gone tomorrow. Emissions climb high

into the atmosphere, borne on trade winds that circumnavigate the globe.

<p>"We are talking about someone squirting hair spray in the morning in

Los Angeles, but by the end of the day it may be reaching someone in

South America or beyond," said UC Irvine chemist Donald Blake, who has

collaborated with the researchers on a related study. "It's a whole new

way of thinking global. Everybody is downwind of something."

<p>Smoke and dust in the sky can dramatically influence climate on Earth.

Some pollutants, including soot, nitrates and sulfates from fossil-fuel

burning, coat the planet in a fine, aerosol haze. Scientists say too many

particles floating around can reflect sunlight, impair crop production in

certain places and contribute to cooler temperatures in some places.

<p>Conversely, diesel soot and carbon dioxide are powerful greenhouse

gases. They shroud the planet like a blanket, preventing heat from

escaping Earth and increasing world temperatures. Those emissions are

likely to increase as experts say worldwide fossil fuel consumption is

expected to grow by 60% over the next 20 years.

<p>Cleaning up global smog will not be easy. Blame falls on industrial

and developing nations alike. Although the United States has some of the

world's most stringent pollution control laws, those controls do not

apply abroad. International cooperation, similar to the agreement between

Canada and the United States to reduce acid rain emissions, will be

required.

<p>Michael Kenny, executive officer for the California Air Resources

Board, said one strategy is to seek international standards for vehicles

and power plants. He said multinational corporations that manufacture

those and other products need to take a leadership role. Environmental

groups and other nongovernmental organizations also need to address the

matter.

<p>"It means what we have to do is look at this more globally. It's going

to be very difficult. This is going to have to be addressed on a global

scale," Kenny said.

<p>Scientists have long known that air pollutants cover vast distances.

Desert dust storms in the Sahara deposit sand in the Caribbean, and Gobi

Desert sand has blown to North America. Volcanic ash from the 1980 Mt.

St. Helens eruption drifted for hundreds of miles. And the meltdown of

the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in the former Soviet Union spread

radionuclides all over the world.

<p>But the new findings show how human activity, from forest clearing in

the tropics to fuel combustion in the industrialized world, can

accumulate into giant plumes of gases that span continents and oceans.

<p>Among the most dramatic findings are immense clouds of carbon monoxide

gas blowing across the southern Pacific Ocean from grassland and forest

fires in Africa and South America from March to December of last year.

The smoke plumes slowly traveled across the Southern Hemisphere more than

6,000 miles to Australia.

<p>In addition, heavy pulses of carbon monoxide, emanating from Asia,

Southeast Asia and the Indian subcontinent, stretch across the Pacific,

all the way to California and other parts of the North American

continent. On the ground, researchers have measured the arrival of

intercontinental drift of chemicals from the Olympic Peninsula in

Washington state to the Bay Area.

<p>Last year, scientists noticed extensive air pollution generated by

forest fires in the American West, although most of the emissions

originating in the United States are from fossil-fuel burning for heating

and transportation.

<p>Carbon monoxide concentrations reach as much as 150 parts per billion

in the air over the Northern Hemisphere, more than double the levels

found in the Southern Hemisphere. Humans produce about half the emissions

of carbon monoxide, which is a long-lived poisonous gas and an indicator

of the presence of other gaseous pollutants.

<b><br>

<p>Pollution Diluted as It Floats From Source

</b>

<p>The health consequences for people living far downwind of air

pollution are uncertain. The farther pollutants are transported, and the

higher they float in the sky, the more diluted they become. Carbon

monoxide levels present in smoke plumes over the Northern Hemisphere are

well within health-based standards set by the U.S. Environmental

Protection Agency. And typically the most unhealthful air pollution

occurs near its sources, from motor vehicles to indoor paints and

chemicals.

<p>"It's an open question as to how much it affects air quality in the

United States," said Richard Turco, director of the Institute of the

Environment at UCLA. "The pollution would have to be transported downward

before it can affect U.S. cities, because the pollutants are usually

transported high in the atmosphere."

<p>With the help of the satellite, which circles the Earth 15 times daily

aboard NASA's Terra spacecraft, scientists are able to see where air

pollution originates, how far it spreads and when it is released. That

data is critical to developing strategies to predict air pollution and

develop countermeasures to protect public health, U.S. Environmental

Protection Agency officials said.

<p>"Such information will help us improve our understanding of the

linkages between air pollution and global climate change, and it will

likely play a pivotal role in the development of international

environmental policy," said atmospheric chemist Daniel Jacob of Harvard

University, who participated in the study.
