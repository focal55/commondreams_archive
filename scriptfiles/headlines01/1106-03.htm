Government records about plutonium and uranium loaned to U.S. academic institutions, private companies, hospitals and other government agencies cannot account for "substantial" amounts of the material, according to a report released yesterday by the Energy Department inspector general.

<p>The investigation into the matter, which began before the Sept. 11 terrorist acts, did not conclude that the radioactive materials were lost or stolen from the facilities. Instead, it said there was "a weakness in controls over potentially dangerous materials" in record-keeping by a private contractor used to track the materials. </p><p>Although one official said the lapse might turn out to be only "sloppy bookkeeping," officials said the Energy Department is taking the report seriously because of concerns that terrorists may be trying to acquire radioactive materials.</p><p>The Energy Department has called for an early meeting with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which licensed the research institutions, and the private contractor whose job it is to keep track of the materials. The identity of the contractor was not disclosed.</p><p>Although some of the record-keeping problems were discovered before 1994, "It was not until 2001 when, in response to our report . . . [that Energy's] security operation was tasked to correct these problems," the report said.</p><p>In one case, a Sept. 30, 2000, management record showed a "significant quantity of plutonium" at a facility that the NRC said "had not held plutonium since 1966," the report said.</p><p>Energy Department officials said the unaccounted-for plutonium may have been washed away during decontamination and decommissioning of the facilities, according to the report.</p><p>At another site, the report said, management records show significant amounts of plutonium while the NRC said the facility's license was terminated in 1993 and "no material was at this location."</p><p>In neither case, the report said, could the NRC or Energy Department security operations explain the discrepancies in the records.</p><p>In the case of 119 locations, the management records showed licensees returned to the Energy Department substantially more nuclear materials than originally loaned or leased. In those cases, Energy officials believed the original transfer of the material was incorrectly reported. In 35 instances where more than 2,500 grams of plutonium were reported returned, Energy Department security officials resolved all the discrepancies five months after being notified of the problem.</p><p>As the result of this inquiry, the department's inspector general may have to conduct a similar audit of records of nuclear materials held by the nation's nuclear weapons laboratories, "where significantly greater numbers are involved," an Energy Department official said.</p><p>
