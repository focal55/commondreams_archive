LIMA, Peru — Five years ago a military court here condemned Lori Berenson, a former M.I.T. student and the daughter of two New York City college professors, to a life sentence on charges she was involved in a terrorist plan to seize the Peruvian Congress and take its members hostage.

The Berenson family appealed on March 14 for Peru to free Lori at a civilian retrial on terrorism charges starting March 20, saying any sentence now would be unjust. Berenson was jailed for life by a hooded military judge in 1996 as a leader of the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA), but her sentence was overturned last year. Prosecutors are now calling for a 20-year sentence. REUTERS/Paco Sanseviero <br>

At that time, with Peru still struggling to quell two Marxist terrorist insurgencies, Ms. Berenson was not given a chance to rebut the evidence at her trial. Her lawyer was denied the opportunity to cross-examine witnesses. And the judges wore masks to hide their identities.
<P> Since then, she has spent much of her time in a frigid prison high in the Andes reserved for Peru's most notorious terrorists.</P>
<P> On Tuesday, a new trial of Ms. Berenson is scheduled to begin, this time before a civilian court that the government hopes will show how much the Peruvian justice system has changed for the better in the four months since Alberto K. Fujimori resigned as president and fled the country to escape corruption charges.</P>
<P> Mark and Rhoda Berenson, who have campaigned vigorously to win their daughter's release, want the case thrown out. They say that a fair trial is still impossible in Peru and that their daughter faces double jeopardy with a second trial, which a top military court granted last August after years of pressure from Washington.</P>
<P> But if government prosecutors have their way, the future for Ms. Berenson, now 31, will not look not much different from the immediate past and she will be sentenced to a 20-year term on the reduced charge of "terrorist collaboration."</P>
<P> Prosecutors will present much of the same evidence from the first trial. It reportedly showed that Ms. Berenson, who had long been drawn to leftist causes in Latin American, posed as a journalist to study the Congress and its security systems in preparation for an attack by the Túpac Amaru Revolutionary Movement, a Marxist terrorist group. The group was known for bombings, kidnappings and taking protection money from drug traffickers.</P>
<P> The attack was intended to take hostages to trade for hundreds of imprisoned terrorists, the government says, but the security forces foiled the raid in the planning stages.</P>
<P> The prosecutors will show a forged Peruvian voting identification card bearing her photo that was found in a 1995 raid on a safe house, and offer testimony by a convicted terrorist that she served a variety of functions for the Túpac Amaru group, including renting the safe house and serving the rebels food. </P>
<P> The convicted terrorist, a Panamanian named Pacífico Castrellón, said in a transcribed interview with the police that he traveled with Ms. Berenson from Panama to Ecuador, where Ms. Berenson introduced him to Néstor Cerpa, Túpac Amaru's military leader. Prosecutors will note that while supposedly working as a reporter in and around Congress she used Mr. Cerpa's wife as her photographer.</P>
<P> Ms. Berenson will proclaim her innocence, say her lawyers, who argue that she was duped by the terrorists to help their cause. They say the photo identification could have been planted, noting that the card does not bear her signature. They argue that several imprisoned terrorists have changed or amplified previous testimony to say that Ms. Berenson was never a collaborator. They say that she never knew the true identity of her photographer or others involved in the planning.</P>
<P> A verdict is several weeks away, if not months. Three judges will hear oral arguments, and then decide the case by a majority vote. A special court is being set up for the trial at the San Juan de Lurigancho Prison, outfitted with television monitors and extra seats. Whatever decision the judges reach may be appealed to the Supreme Court.</P>
<P> "Lori is a vegetarian," Mark Berenson, her father, told reporters on Thursday. "She has never even gone hunting or fishing. She could never hurt another human being. She's been a political football kicked around. It's a sham."</P>
<P> Her mother, Rhoda, said after seeing her daughter this week that Ms. Berenson continued to suffer the effects of years spent at high altitude and in cold. But she added, "She is mentally strong and she knows she is innocent and feels that eventually the truth will be heard."</P>
<P> But Peruvian human rights groups that have long crusaded to free hundreds of people wrongfully imprisoned by antiterrorist military courts have shunned the Berenson case.</P>
<P> "Our evaluation is that she deserves a correct, fair trial, but that in a free court she would be condemned," said Ronald Gamara, a leading human rights lawyer, in an interview late last year before he joined the transition government. Mr. Gamara has written a book about innocent people imprisoned under the Fujimori administration. </P>
<P> Ms. Berenson's political engagement with Latin America began when she was a student of anthropology at M.I.T. in the 1980's. She protested United States involvement in El Salvador, and eventually became a private aide to the leader of the most radical faction of the Salvadoran guerrilla movement, according to former guerrillas.</P>
<P> She was arrested in Peru on a public bus in November 1995 around the time the security forces raided the terrorist safe house, where 8,000 rounds of ammunition and 3,000 sticks of dynamite were found.</P>
<P> Ms. Berenson is roundly unpopular in Peru primarily because of a statement she made that was televised at the time of her initial judicial proceedings.</P>
<P> "If it is a crime to worry about the subhuman conditions in which the majority of this population lives, then I will accept my punishment," Ms. Berenson said, her face showing rage. "Here nobody can deny that in Peru there is much injustice. There is an institutionalized violence that has killed the people's finest sons and condemned children to die of hunger."</P>
<P> Ms. Berenson's family and lawyers said she was under great stress when she made those remarks after spending more than a week in a cell with a guerrilla, a woman, who was bleeding from gunshot wounds. But in several interviews since she was imprisoned, Ms. Berenson has refused to criticize the Túpac Amaru group and she has chosen to remain in the same prison ward with Túpac Amaru prisoners rather than transfer to wards with prisoners who have repented.</P>
<P> When Túpac Amaru terrorists took hundreds of hostages at the Japanese ambassador's residence in December 1996, they included Ms. Berenson on a list of 434 imprisoned people whose freedom they demanded in return for the hostages. After months of negotiations, the terrorists reduced the list to 20, including Ms. Berenson, according to a former senior Clinton administration official. </P>
<P> President Fujimori ultimately refused to negotiate and all 14 terrorists were gunned down during the rescue of the 71 hostages they still held.</P>
<P> More than 500 prisoners have been released in recent years after an investigation by a Peruvian commission found that they had been wrongfully imprisoned. The panel did not call for Ms. Berenson's release.</P>
<P> For years the Clinton administration urged President Fujimori to grant Ms. Berenson a new, civilian trial, and in his final days in office President Clinton called President Valentín Paniagua, who took office late last year, to ask that she be released.</P>
<P> President Paniagua refused, but promised she would receive a fair trial without political interference.</P>
<P> In ruling for a second trial, the military court said new evidence showed that Ms. Berenson was not a leader of the terrorist group as originally charged. The Berenson family and other critics viewed the decision as an attempt by President Fujimori to improve relations with the United States after his much criticized re- election in a vote marred by fraud.</P>
<P> Those who say the Berenson case has been political all along point to a videotaped meeting between Vladimiro Montesinos, Peru's fugitive former spy chief, and Eduardo Ferrer, then foreign minister, in January 1998, in which they discussed how to handle a possible new trial for Ms. Berenson. To avert more criticism of the military courts, the recently released videotape shows, Mr. Montesinos suggested her case could be transferred to a civilian court where she could receive a lighter, 10- to 15- year sentence.</P>
<P> Ms. Berenson's family and lawyers say the court system and law enforcement apparatus remain full of officials appointed during the Fujimori regime despite its replacement by a new government promising reforms.</P>
<P> "How much influence does Montesinos and former President Fujimori still have?" asked Ramsey Clark, the former attorney general who is helping in Ms. Berenson's defense. "Lori is a political prisoner."</P>
