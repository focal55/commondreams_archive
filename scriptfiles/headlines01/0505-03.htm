Leading environmentalists said yesterday that the Bush administration's 

agreement to keep 58.5 million acres of national forest off-limits to logging, 

road building and mining appears deceptive and may undo three decades of 

conservation effort.

<P>In a brief filed in U.S. District Court in Boise, Idaho, and at a press 

conference by Secretary of Agriculture Ann Veneman, the administration 

insisted that it will leave the Roadless Area Conservation Rule -- former 

President Bill Clinton's chief environmental legacy -- in place.

</table>But while affirming a "commitment to the important challenge of protecting 

roadless values," Veneman added that the administration will take a 

"commonsense approach to roadless protection."

<P>Resources-industry representatives who had fought imposition of the Clinton 

administration rule said they were relieved to learn that Bush will consider 

amendments to the rule and make decisions on a case-by-case basis.

<P>"We can only assume that taking another look at (the roadless rule) will 

lead to a better long-term decision," said Denise Jones, executive director of 

the California Mining Association. "As adopted by the Clinton administration, 

it was extremely restrictive and would've limited mineral development on 

federal land."

<P>Critics of the Clinton rule -- including boards of supervisors from several 

of California's rural counties -- contend that it will damage local economies 

and increase the risk of wildfires.

<P>Neil Lawrence, an attorney with the Natural Resources Defense Council, said 

it appears that the administration is contemplating "a sneak attack . . . that 

would aim a dagger at the heart of the roadless rule."

<P>Lawrence, along with other environmental leaders, says the administration 

seems bent on dealing with roadless issues on a piecemeal approach. Such an 

approach already "has eaten away at our last best places," he said.

<P>But Chris Nance, a spokesman for the California Forestry Association, said 

that "we're pleased to see that the administration recognized the value of 

national forest planning."

<P>As the rule now stands, "it's analogous to a scenario whereby the feds 

mandate the purchase of snowplows for use in San Francisco without taking 

input from anybody in San Francisco," he said.

<P>Sierra Club Executive Director Carl Pope discounted the notion that the new 

policy favors local control over central bureaucracy.

<P>The Bush administration "isn't talking about local control," he said. "It's 

talking about control by the timber industry. It's the old system, and we're 

not going to get different results by going back to the old planning process."

<P>"It's asking a lot for a forest ranger to stand up to Boise Cascade and say 

no," said Doug Honnold, an attorney for Earth Justice Legal Defense Fund in 

Bozeman, Mont.

<P>Brian Vincent of Nevada City, a spokesman for the American Lands Alliance, 

was even more vehement.

<P>"The president has essentially gutted the roadless plan by giving more 

clout to those most hostile to forest protection," he said.

<P>James Lyons, undersecretary of agriculture in the Clinton administration 

and now a professor at Yale University, said his "greatest fear is that this 

will simply revert to a process that leads us to more conflict, more 

confrontation and a return to war in the woods."

<P>Michael Anderson, senior resource analyst for the Wilderness Society, said, 

"It's inconceivable that a process that resulted in 1.6 million comments, the 

most ever recorded on a federal rule-making, could be thrown out as not having 

adequate public participation."

<P>The dispute over how much development, logging and harvesting should occur 

in the national forests goes back to 1972, with the initiation of the Roadless 

Area Review and Evaluation plans, known as RARE I and RARE II.

<P>The roadless areas covered by the Clinton administration rule are not 

wilderness, although wilderness status is still being sought for some.

<P>California has 4,416,000 acres of roadless area spread among its 20.6 

million acres of national forest, which include 4.1 million acres of 

wilderness.

<P>As a practical matter, yesterday's developments figure to have little short-

term effect on U.S. Forest Service operations in California. Just 9.75 miles 

of logging roads and 50 miles of roads for other purposes were on the planning 

board, said Forest Service spokesman Matt Mathes.

<P>Among the potential friction points if the Clinton administration rule is 

put up for re-examination and amendment are the San Joaquin roadless area in 

Inyo National Forest, contiguous to the Ansel Adams Wilderness Area; the north 

fork of the American River; the north and middle forks of the Stanislaus River; and the Chinquapin roadless area in the Shasta-Trinity National Forest.
