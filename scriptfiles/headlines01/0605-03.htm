Most respondents to a Washington Post-ABC News poll released yesterday 

agree with California Gov. Gray Davis that the federal government should set 

limits on the wholesale price of electricity, which President Bush has said he 

opposes amid the likelihood of rolling blackouts this summer in the largest 

state.

<P>Of those polled, 56 percent said they favored price limits, even though it 

was pointed out that such a measure could discourage development of new 

supplies. Forty percent said they opposed price caps, which Davis said he 

would seek in federal court after Bush ruled out the idea during a face-to-

face meeting last week.

<P>Bush's energy plan, which he announced last month and has been promoting 

with a series of road trips, is weighted toward increasing production of oil, 

coal and natural gas, as well as nuclear power. Democrats contend the plan 

would benefit the energy industry without lowering prices for consumers.

<P>The poll of 1,004 adults was taken May 31 through Sunday and has an error 

margin of plus or minus 3 percentage points.
