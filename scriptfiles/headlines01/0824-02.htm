</font></font></font></font>The case has been on the legal and environmental agenda in

Bogotá and Washington for more than two decades, a period in which

Colombia went from being a mere processor of the basic paste for

cocaine production - using coca leaves grown in Bolivia and Peru -

to the world's leading grower of the coca bush. 

<P>

   As far as the illegal poppies, 'papaver somniferum', which

produce a sap that is used in making the narcotics morphine, opium

or heroin, US government figures indicate that this Andean-Amazon

country has become the world's second-ranked producer, after

Afghanistan. 

<P>

   Fumigations returned to the forefront of political debate last

month as the result of a claim for legal protection filed by the

Organization of Indigenous Peoples of the Colombian Amazon

(OPIAC). 

<P>

   The native group requested that a Bogotá court issue a stay on

the aerial spraying of anti-narcotic herbicides in indigenous

territories, arguing that the glyphosate is endangering the health

of the human population and livestock, has toxic effects on food

crops and on local flora and fauna, and is poisoning local water

supplies. 

<P>

   OPIAC invoked Colombia's constitutional mandate that indigenous

peoples have the right to participate in government decisions that

affect their territories or endanger their survival. 

<P>

   The fumigations were called off, but a subsequent appeals court

ruling reversed the decision in the OPIAC case and the government-

sponsored aerial spraying resumed. 

<P>

   On Aug 9, the native group took the case to the next level,

filing an appeal with the Constitutional Court, which is to issue

a definitive ruling next month. 

<P>

   In parallel, a civil action filed with a court in Cundinamarca -

the department whose jurisdiction includes Bogotá - called on the

institutions of the Environment Ministry to study the effects of

the fumigations and to issue a public statement on their findings. 

<P>

   But the Colombian Institute of Hydrology, Meteorology and

Environmental Studies, the Von Humboldt Institute and the Sinchi

Institute of Amazonian Studies responded that the case does not

fall under their jurisdiction, but that of the National Narcotics

Directorate, which has until November to assess the environmental

impact of the glyphosate sprayings.  

<P>

   ''No thorough study of the effects of glyphosate is available

in Colombia,'' complained agronomist Tomás León, professor at the

Institute of Environmental Studies of the National University of

Bogotá. 

<P>

   However, a study has been completed on the high concentration

of herbicides used on illicit crops, León told Tierramérica. 

<P>

   According to that report, in 1998 more than 148,000 tons of

agro-chemicals were used over an area of 78,000 hectares of drug

plantations, 18 times more than was used in standard fumigations

of legal - mostly food - crops in the rest of the country. 

<P>

   The quantity is the sum of the pesticides used by the growers

of coca and poppies to protect their crops from infestations and

the glyphosate sprayed by government forces to eradicate the

fields, he explained. 

<P>

   The National Anti-Narcotics Council of Colombia reports that

the glyphosate mixture used in drug eradication sprayings is of a

concentration 26 times greater than what is recommended for

agricultural application. 

<P>

   Both the US ambassador in Bogotá, Anne Patterson, and

Colombia's Interior minister, Armando Estrada, have given the nod

in favor of the anti-drug fumigations. 

<P>

   Patterson told the Colombian Congress on Aug 6 that suspending

the drug-eradicating fumigations would mean putting President

Andrés Pastrana's Plan Colombia on hold, the axis of the anti-

narcotics policy agreed by Bogotá and Washington. 

<P>

   The plan bears a price tag of 7.5 billion dollars, with 1.3

billion coming from the United States, largely in military

equipment for Colombia's bases in the south and southeast, two

areas where there is a high guerrilla presence.  

<P>

   The decades-long armed conflict in this country, involving

leftist guerrillas, right-wing paramilitaries and government

forces, complicates the fight against narcotics production as the

irregular armed groups are said to have ties to the drug trade as

a means to finance their operations. 

<P>

   Two days after Patterson's speech, Ricardo Vargas, an expert in

drug-trafficking issues and member of the non-governmental

organization Andean Action and of the Transnational Institute,

sent an open letter to the US ambassador in which he outlined a

scenario without fumigations. 

<P>

   ''By suspending the fumigations and the armed forces' actions

in the coca-growing zones, in a very short time there would be an

over-production of the coca leaf, and subsequently a spectacular

drop in the price of the basic coca paste,'' Vargas stated in the

first of the 15 points in his letter. 

<P>

   ''This would produce an effect that 25 years of fumigations in

Colombia have not achieved: reducing the area of coca

production,'' he wrote. 

<P>

   The number of hectares in Colombia planted with illegal crops

has continued to rise. Indigenous leader Floro Tunubalá, governor

of the southern department of Cauca, is an outspoken anti-

fumigation activist because the practice ''is harmful, costly and

ineffective.''  He cites reports that the area planted with drug

crops nationwide has expanded from 20,000 hectares in 1976 to

160,000 today. 

<P>

   Parmenio Cuéllar, governor of Nariño, another southern

Colombian department, met with lawmakers in Washington last month

to seek support for halting US financing of anti-drug aerial

spraying at least until health and environmental impact studies

have been completed. 

<P>

   For his part, Interior minister Estrada maintains that the

priority is to halt drug trafficking, which he described as ''the

fuel of violence, origin of corruption and responsible for the

rise in drug addiction among Colombian youth.'' 

<P>

   ''To confront this scourge the government has a variety of

policies,'' fumigation, prohibition and the voluntary and manual

eradication of illegal crops, said the minister.
