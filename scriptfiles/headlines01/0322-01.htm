Nato troops and international agencies in Kosovo should have done more to disarm Albanian extremists and bring them to justice, senior British defence officials admitted yesterday. 

<P>Many of the extremists, including Macedonian Albanians, fought with the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) during Nato's bombing campaign in 1999 and were advised by the SAS, special forces from other Nato countries and the CIA.  

<P>"They are very clearly KLA-linked," a well-placed Whitehall source said, referring to Albanian guerrillas who have been infiltrating Macedonia.  

<P>The defence sources also made it clear they were disillusioned with ethnic Albanian political leaders in Kosovo for not taking a more aggressive stand against the extremists. "They disown responsibility but there is no active political leadership," they said.  

<P>The sources painted a picture of a disparate group of Albanian rebels engaged in political extremism and organised crime. Some wanted a Greater Albania, which would take in Kosovo, south-east Serbia and north-west Macedonia.  

<P>Thousands were bound together by clan links, and a diaspora, mainly in the US and Germany. Some were simply after territory, others were mafia groups or smugglers.  

<P>They will present a "long-term problem", said the sources who added: "You cannot disinvent a mind-set."  

<P>British military officials described the attacks across the Macedonia border as a "limited insurgency" involving between 300 and 800 guerrilla fighters. They were "well consolidated" in the hills above Tetovo, Macedonia's second city.  

<P>British troops have adopted a more robust approach to Albanian extremists than others, notably, until very recently, American soldiers.  

<P>Defence sources said that all K-For peacekeepers would now adopt a more aggressive presence on the Kosovo side of   the Macedonian border. But they admitted the mountainous border between Macedonia and Albania, where there are no K-For troops but a plentiful supply of arms, was extremely difficult to control.  

<P>Significantly, for the first time this week, Robin Cook and Javier Solana, the UN's security supremo, described Albanian guerrillas as "terrorists", a term previously used by Russia.  

<P>In an implicit defence of the KLA's activities during the Kosovo war - and Nato's support for it - Mr Cook argues that there is a huge difference between the "brutal" government of the former Yugoslav president, Slobodan Milosevic, and the multi-ethnic democratic government of Macedonia. "This is not Kosovo," said a senior defence official.  

<P>Nato and the EU say that while the territorial integrity of Macedonia must be maintained, "legitimate" grievances of the ethnic Albanian minority, forming up to 30% of Macedonia's population, must be recognised.
