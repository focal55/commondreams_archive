Two-thirds of Americans are concerned that the US campaign could escalate into a wider war pitting America and its allies against the Arab and Muslim world, according to a poll released yesterday. <P>The ABC News poll also found fewer than half of Americans have a positive view of Islam, while about two-thirds said they lacked a good understanding of that religion.  <P>Some 1,009 American adults were questioned by telephone on Monday and Tuesday for the poll.  <P>Respondents were asked whether they were worried that the conflict could turn into a broader war between the US and its allies against Arabs and Muslims. Sixty-six percent said they were worried (25% greatly worried and 41% somewhat worried), while 33% said they were not worried and 1% had no opinion.  <P>In addition, 69% of respondents said the US was doing all it could to prevent an escalation, while 28% said it should do more, and the rest had no opinion.  <P>Asked their opinion of Islam, 47% said they had a favourable view, 39% were unfavourable and 13% had no opinion. Sixty-five percent said they did not have a good, basic understanding of the teachings and beliefs of Islam, while 34% said they did.  <P>Most respondents - 55% - said they believed that most Arabs and Muslims around the world had a negative view of the US, while 36% said they felt there was a positive view.
