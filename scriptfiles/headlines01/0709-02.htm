WASHINGTON - New concerns have arisen about the

safety of the US food supply and about the effectiveness of

current efforts to maintain a separation between genetically

engineered and conventional products.

</table>This follows revelations last week that StarLink, a genetically

modified variety of yellow corn engineered by Aventis CropScience,

had been found in white corn products after consumers complained

of allergic reactions. 

<P>

The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved

StarLink for human consumption because of its potential to trigger

allergy symptoms. Although it is supposed to be fed only to

animals, the modified corn was detected in yellow corn foodstuffs

late last year, when people reported adverse reactions. <P>

Some manufacturers and retailers of the foodstuffs - including

tortilla chips and taco shells - switched to white corn, reasoning

that this way they could be sure there was no Starlink, which is

yellow, in their products. But in February, the FDA found genetic

material from StarLink in Kash 'n' Karry brand white corn tortilla

chips in Florida. 

<P>

''The US government's inability to contain StarLink shows how

other undesirable biotech crops could get loose in the world food

supply,'' says Larry Bohlen, director of Friends of the Earth's

health and environment program.

<P>

Since most European countries, including Britain, France and

Italy, prohibit the sale of foods containing biotech ingredients

unless they are clearly labeled, the StarLink contamination has

provoked concerns that bio-engineered grains could get into

exported food. 

<P>

The controversy over biologically engineered corn and the

continuing discovery of StarLink corn in products sold abroad has

already prompted one country, Sri Lanka, to ban any use of the

biotech corn, says Bohlen. 

<P>

The World Health Organization and United Nations Food and

Agriculture Organization are expected to soon approve

international safety guidelines for genetically modified foods. If

approved, the standards would require a tightening of US safety

assessment procedures if genetically modified crops from the

United States are to have access to agricultural markets abroad. 

<P>

The FDA does not require that all genetically modified foods be

subjected to safety assessments before they are launched on the

market, as they are in the European Union. <P>

The FDA only found the genetic traces of the StarLink corn after

it received a complaint by Keith Finger, a doctor living in

Florida. Last year, Finger had reported suffering an allergic

reaction to yellow corn products tainted with StarLink. In

February, he reported a milder reaction after eating white corn

chips. <P>

The FDA's discovery of StarLink in a white corn product is

significant, says Bohlen, because it comes despite manufacturers'

switch to white corn, which makes up less than three percent of

the US corn market. It also raises serious new questions about the

spread of the genetically engineered crop, adds Bohlen, because

the gene could have found its way into white corn through cross-

pollination. <P>

Federal regulators are now investigating the facility that

produced the white corn chips to determine how the snack food was

contaminated. Both the Kash 'n' Karry and Food Lion grocery chains

that sold the products, voluntarily pulled the product from their

shelves this week. <P>

Finger was one of dozens of people who reported that they had

suffered an allergic reactions to yellow corn products tainted

with StarLink last year. <P>

Last month, the US government released a report that concluded

that 17 people - including Finger - who complained of possible

allergy attacks did not have any antibodies in their blood linked

to StarLink's key component. <P>

Environmentalists, however, say the report is flawed and

inconclusive. They argue that the latest news proves that more

comprehensive tests are needed. <P>

StarLink is genetically altered to contain the plant pesticide

Bacillus thuringienis, or Bt, which kills the dreaded European

corn borer. Aventis has applied for an exemption to the

government's restriction of StarLink. 

<P>

While the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has stated that

StarLink may cause allergies in humans, a special advisory panel

of the administration will meet July 17-18 to discuss whether

enough scientific evidence exists to safely allow small amounts of

StarLink in human foods. 

<P>

Bohlen, whose research last year alerted the FDA to the spread of

StarLink into human food products, says the new reports of

contaminated white corn should prompt the EPA to revise its

estimates of people exposed to StarLink. <P>

''Because allergies develop over time, this increase in exposure

increases the likelihood that people will develop allergies to

StarLink,'' he says. <P>

Unable to guarantee the complete separation of StarLink from other

corn varieties, US corn growers also want regulators to allow a

certain amount of StarLink corn in food products. <P>

An absolute zero percent presence of StarLink corn in foods eaten

by humans is not realistic, says David Uchic, a spokesperson for

the National Corn Growers Association, because contamination could

occur through cross-pollination and during storage.
