LONDON (Reuters) - Britain should lead the way on new

international controls over the use of cluster bombs, weapons

which are as dangerous as land mines, the <a href="http://www.dianaspencer.net/" target="_new">Diana, Princess of

Wales Memorial Fund</a> said at the launch of a campaign on Monday.

<p>The fund, which helps land mine victims, launched the

campaign with other aid groups to coincide with the fourth

anniversary of Britain signing the Ottawa Land mine Treaty.

<p>The treaty bans the use of anti-personnel mines and

requires clearance of mined land.

<p>``It seems a timely moment to urge the UK government to take

a leadership role in rallying international opinion behind

international humanitarian law to also apply to cluster bombs,''

fund Chief Executive Andrew Purkis said.

<p>Richard Lloyd, director of campaign group <a href="http://www.landmineaction.org/" target="_new">Landmine Action</a>,

cited U.S. military figures showing that 600 cluster bombs had

been used in Afghanistan, each containing 202 small bomblets.

<p>He said they were designed to kill within a range of 150

meters, pierce five inches of armor and set fire to material.

<p>``When the container opens up and scatters the bomblets on

the ground, they are supposed to detonate on impact...our

experience is that a high proportion of them don't,'' he said.

<p>``The conservative estimate is that 10 percent of these

bomblets fail to go off...If there's been 120,000 bomblets used

in Afghanistan already, then there's 12,000 of these lying

around waiting to explode at the slightest touch,'' he added.

<p>Lloyd said he was receiving more and more reports of

casualties on the ground in Afghanistan, including one of a

10-year-old boy who mistook a bomblet for a food packet.

<p>The bomblets are yellow, like the more than two million

food packets dropped by the United States, he said.

<p>POST-CONFLICT PROTECTION

<p>Cluster bombs and anti-vehicle mines kill and maim people

returning home to try and rebuild their lives, Lloyd said.

<p>``What we are campaigning for is new international law to

require the users of explosive weapons to clear them up

afterwards. The aim is to get militaries to protect civilians

post-conflict as well as during a conflict,'' he said.

<p>The Sandy Gall Appeal for Afghanistan, which provides mine

victims with artificial limbs, said cluster bombs added to what

the United Nations  estimates are one and a half million

unexploded mines in the country.

<p>Purkis said an upcoming review of the 1980 Inhumane Weapons

Convention at a U.N. conference on December 10-21 in Geneva was

an opportunity to address the problems of cluster bombs.

<p>``That meeting could order an expert panel to prepare a new

protocol that would cover cluster bombs and other explosive

remnants, with a view to bringing them within the UN Convention

for the first time,'' he said.

<p>``What is really important is that the state parties

gathered in Geneva feel the force of public opinion, feel that

this is a moral issue that people mind about. The recent use of

cluster bombs in Afghanistan highlights the problem because

these bombs are being dropped in our name, now, `` Purkis said.</p>
