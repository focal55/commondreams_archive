GHENT, Belgium &#150;&#150;  Global trade can help win the war against terrorism if the West spreads the wealth it generates more equitably, former President Clinton told a conference of globalization critics Tuesday.

<p>

"Not everyone who's angry is angry at the civilized world and wants to destroy it," Clinton said. "A lot are angry because they can't be a part of it."

</table>Arguing for more globalization, not a retrenchment in the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks on the United States, Clinton said bringing terror suspect Osama bin Laden to justice is not enough.

<p>

"We need to reduce the pool of potential terrorists by increasing the number of potential partners in the 21st century world," he said.

<p>

He called on Western nations to foot the bill to raise living standards and improve education in the developing world to promote equal opportunity.

<p>

"Global trade is not bad, but there's not enough," Clinton said. "We need to spread the benefits and reduce the burdens quickly to all the people."

<p>

Clinton was invited to the University of Ghent by the current president of the European Union, Belgian Prime Minister Guy Verhofstadt, who has sought to organize a debate on "ethical globalization" ever since anti-globalization radicals rioted outside an EU summit in June.

<p>

Rather than the attacks overshadowing the discussion, speakers agreed that solving problems like the growing gap between rich and poor &#150; what Clinton called "the dark side" of globalization &#150; has become even more urgent.

<p>

"In a way, the Western world saw the price of poverty flashed up on its TV screens on Sept. 11," Verhofstadt said.

<p>

"Poor unstable countries and regions that fall prey to gangs of criminals" like bin Laden's al-Qaida network are part of the price, he said.

<p>

Some speakers expressed fears that the U.S.-led military response to the attacks would divert resources and attention from anti-poverty programs.

<p>

"It's a no-win situation for us," said Dr. Owens Wiwa, a Nigerian activist who expects a tougher time raising money for Africa's AIDS crisis.

<p>

Naomi Klein, a best-selling Canadian author and anti-corporate activist, said she was afraid the war atmosphere would make it harder to be publicly critical of globalization.

<p>

"People are afraid that being critical of the market is seen as being anti-American, even treasonous," she said.

<p>

But she said she felt that the needs of the poor and excluded would have to be addressed.

<p>

"It's become a security issue," she said.
