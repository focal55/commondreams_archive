QUITO  - Free trade in the Americas will not benefit

the Latin American or Caribbean nations as long as the United

States refuses to lift its import barriers, warns US economist

Joseph Stiglitz, a winner of this year's Nobel Prize for economics.

<P>

   The United States is not willing to eliminate its generous farm

subsidies or its restrictions on the entry into the US market of

products like sugar and beef from Brazil, Stiglitz told IPS in an

interview Friday in the Ecuadorian capital. <P>

    As such, he said, the Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA)

being negotiated by 34 countries of the Western Hemisphere will

not benefit the economies of Latin America and the Caribbean, but

will instead prolong an unequal relationship. <P>

   The United States maintains that it will begin dismantling

tariffs under the FTAA in 2005, but it would be more just if it

would resolve the existing disparities before moving forward with

the trade negotiations, said the Nobel laureate. <P>

   Stiglitz, former chief economist of the World Bank, was in

Quito invited by the Central Bank of Ecuador to lead a series of

conferences. 

<P>

   The expert stated that the ''dollarization'' models, like

Ecuador's, or the one-to-one parity of the local currency with the

US dollar, as is the case of Argentina, increase vulnerability to

the ups and downs of the global economy. 

<P>

   ''What is happening in Argentina, with its fixed exchange rate,

has demonstrated some of the problems that can arise from a scheme

like that,'' in particular, an overvaluation of the dollar and an

undervaluation of the Argentine peso, he said. <P>

   The economic crisis has caused a dramatic depreciation of the

Brazilian real, while Argentina has found it difficult to export

its goods to Brazil or to Europe because of its fixed exchange

rate. <P>

   Furthermore, Stiglitz argues that the slowdown of the

international economy could bring those countries that are tied to

the dollar profound uncertainty with respect to their ability to

compete on the global market. 

<P>

   And the weakened economies of the United States and Japan are

fueling a worldwide recession, which conspires against the

economies of Latin America, he said. 

<P>

   ''It used to be said that when the United States sneezed,

Mexico caught a cold. With globalization, the United States

sneezes and all Latin America, and much of the rest of the world

end up with a bad case of the flu. Unfortunately, the United

States now has pneumonia,'' he said. 

<P>

   The economist, a professor at Columbia University in New York,

says the crisis affecting Argentina and Brazil is likely to worsen

because ''commodity sales will fall, and the countries that export

to the United States will have to do so at lower prices.'' <P>

   Prior to the Sep 11 terrorist attacks, the US economy was

seeing a slowdown in economic growth, though it had not yet given

way to full recession. However, ''the attacks are now pushing the

economy into a recession,'' stated the expert. 

<P>

   Stiglitz took aim at the World Trade Organization (WTO) for

defending the interests of industrialized countries to the

detriment of the developing world. Though almost all countries are

included in its membership, ''the WTO bases its resolutions on the

interests of the inhabitants of the (industrialized) North,'' he

said. 

<P>

   One example of this is the push the wealthy nations gave the

agreement on intellectual property rights in the Uruguay Round of

multilateral trade negotiations, which culminated in the creation

of the WTO, he pointed out. 

<P>

   The Sep 11 attacks could also harm the globalization process

itself because Washington is adopting extreme security measures

that will inflate its budget. 

<P>

   Furthermore, there are more and more layoffs each day in

various sectors of the US workforce, which will hurt purchasing

power, and therefore contribute to the recession. <P>

   Stiglitz does not think Washington is applying the appropriate

measures, but is instead staking its bets on ''the typical market

policy, which is ineffective in staving off the wave of

recession.'' <P>

   More than ever, given the current context, the United States

should focus on fiscal policies and aim government spending at

combating the effects of the terrorist attacks. The recovery of

the economy, which could take a long time, depends on effective

stimuli from the government, he said. <P>

   In comments on the case of Ecuador, Stiglitz said that while

the national economy recorded moderate growth last year,

production is still not much better than what it was during the

crisis two years ago, and that the stagnation of the standard of

living here is cause for great concern. <P>

   The economist also questioned the five-percent economic growth

rate established among the conditions of an agreement between

Ecuador and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). <P>

   He said he would not give much credence to such projections

because they are based on old models, and he insinuated that the

IMF invents some of the figures involved in its calculations. <P>

   Stiglitz is a co-recipient of this year's Nobel Prize for

economics alongside George Akerlof and Michael Spence, also of the

United States. Through their research conducted in the 1970s and

1980s, the three highlighted the distorting impacts on the market

by what they called ''asymmetric information.'' <P>

   Their approach is based on the premise that one of the parties

in a trade relationship is always at a disadvantage when it comes

to information on the item being negotiated. Government must step

in to correct the problem by playing a stronger role in the

market, say the three laureates. 

<P>

   Stiglitz explained in Quito that the market economy is

characterized by imperfect information, which carries grave

consequences for the development of economies at the global level.

The models that have been applied are erroneous because they

ignore important phenomena like unemployment. 

<P>

   According to the economist, this is due to the fact that

''existing models are based on assumptions that information is

perfect, when the free market is characterized by imperfection.'' 

<P>

   Stiglitz chaired the Council of Economic Advisers during the

first years of the Bill Clinton presidency (1993-2001), and later

served as chief economist at the World Bank. <P>

   He stepped down from that post in late 1999 after issuing

repeated criticisms of the IMF for its handling of Southeast

Asia's financial crisis of 1997-1998. <P>

   His commentaries sparked the ire of top financial officials of

the time, including World Bank president James Wolfensohn, IMF

managing director Michel Camdessus, and US Treasury Secretary

Lawrence Summers. <P>

   Since then, Stiglitz has dedicated himself to the academic

sphere, teaching economics, business and international affairs at

Columbia University. <P>

   Upon announcing the Nobel Prize winners on Oct 10, the award's

committee in Norway underscored Stiglitz's numerous contributions

towards ''transforming they way economists think about markets.''
