The University of California, the nation's largest public university 

system, is being transformed by its need to solicit private dollars from 

corporations and wealthy benefactors.

<P>Fund raising by chancellors, deans and professors has influenced course 

work, redirected research and brought the corporate presence into everyday 

academia. For instance:

<P>-- At the University of California at Berkeley, where nearby Bank of 

America branches were once targets of violent student protests, a $2 million 

donation resulted in the dean of the Haas School of Business being officially 

titled the "BankAmerica dean."

<P>-- Undergraduates at the University of California at San Diego recently 

spent class time designing a cell phone antenna for corporate donor Nokia.

<P>-- At the University of California at Los Angeles, a $5 million donation 

last year resulted in an auditorium named for modernist composer Arnold 

Schoenberg being renamed to honor Dreamworks records executive Mo Ostin and 

his wife, Evelyn. Public outcry forced reversal of the action.

<P>The money raised by hundreds of university administrators, faculty members 

and professional fund-raisers can have an effect on what gets taught. Certain 

courses and entire degree programs would not exist without private money.

<P>A minor in Jewish studies at the University of California at Santa Cruz, 

for instance, was created with more than $2 million in donations.

<P>Private industry, foundations and wealthy individuals subsidize research 

and faculty positions.

<P>Many schools and departments have forged formal, sometimes controversial 

relationships with companies. Novartis, a pharmaceutical company, was given 

two of five seats on a research committee at UC Berkeley after donating $25 

million.

<P>

<H3>RAISE FUNDS OR PERISH</H3>

<P>Professors say they feel pressure to raise funds but fear it will consume 

valuable teaching and research time.

<P>"I think about how more faculty time is being taken away from thinking, how 

more time is taken away from creative teaching," said Kenneth Wachter, 

chairman of the department of demography at UC Berkeley.

<P>Some worry about being judged on their success in collecting money. At the 

University of California at Davis, African American studies professor Patricia 

Turner said members of the faculty are asked to report on their fund raising.

<P>"In a lot of the paperwork you have to fill out now, there is a line that 

says, 'How much external money did you raise?' , " she said. "If you've 

published in journals, how much grant money you've generated should be of 

minimal consideration."

<P>Said UC Berkeley history professor Leon Litwack: "We work very hard as 

professors, teaching and advising graduate students. To try to add fund 

raising to that job, I think, impairs the quality of education our students 

receive."

<P>Those who aren't successful at fund raising pay the price.

<P>In Stephens Hall at UC Berkeley, the Center for African Studies occupies a 

two-room office marked by cracked walls and scuffed linoleum floors.

<P>Down the hall, the Center for Middle Eastern Studies operates out of a 

sumptuously appointed suite of offices with stained glass, gleaming copper 

paneling and a trickling fountain.

<P>A few years ago, these centers were virtually the same. Both made do with 

modest budgets and tiny offices. They shared a copier.

<P>Then Nezar AlSayyad, chairman of Middle Eastern Studies, took two trips to 

Saudi Arabia with UC Berkeley chancellors. He landed a $5 million donation 

from a Saudi Arabian foundation for remodeling and for "The Sultan Program," 

which finances visiting professors and a research program on issues of Arab 

identity.

<P>Despite his success, AlSayyad said he would rather be teaching than raising 

money. "I don't regret it, but if you ask if I'd do it again, I'd say no," he 

said.

<P>

<H3>A QUALITATIVE DIFFERENCE</H3>

<P>Fund raising brought more than $1.2 billion into UC coffers in the 1999 

fiscal year.

<P>The nine-campus university system accelerated fund-raising efforts after 

the state cut its financing in the early '90s. The state now provides less 

than a quarter of UC's budget, down from more than half a decade ago. Other UC 

sources of revenue include student tuition and fees (10 percent), federal 

funds (15.5 percent), sales and services, including those at the medical 

centers, and investment income.

<P>Although less than 7 percent of UC's revenue in 1999-2000 came from private 

sources, that money often is the difference between being good and being great,

<P>between attracting solid faculty and hiring academic superstars, between 

outdated equipment and cutting-edge laboratories.

<P>"The state of California really provides a level of funding that would not 

permit us to maintain a great institution," UC President Richard Atkinson said 

in an interview. "Private funds (are) a requirement to maintain the quality of 

the University of California."

<P>A survey by the UC Berkeley Graduate School of Journalism of 81 department 

heads and other administrators throughout the system found that:

<P>-- Seven out of 10 administrators said their fund-raising efforts increased 

moderately or dramatically during the past five years.

<P>-- Eight of 10 said private funds are important, very important or critical 

to their department's health.

<P>-- Eight of 10 said the private sector is involved in the academic life of 

their department.

<P>"We're discovering that the only way we get extra money is to get it 

ourselves," said Fred Gable, chairman of the music department at the 

University of California at Riverside. "It goes against the entire notion of 

UC as a public school that gets funded by the state."

<P>When UC Berkeley's Haas School of Business announced that its dean -- now 

economist Laura Tyson -- would be called the BankAmerica dean, some alumni 

raised questions, said associate dean Jay Stowsky.

<P>"Our answers have always been consistent," he said. "What is the 

alternative? If the state of California is reducing the budget for the 

university, we have to make sure the university has top-notch faculty. We have 

to turn to private sources, rich individuals and corporations."

<P>Sometimes just the possibility of a conflict of interest is enough to 

ignite controversy. In 1997, UCLA's history department turned down a $1 

million grant from the Turkish government to fund a professorship in Turkish 

history after the Armenian community complained that such a post would help 

Turkey cover up its role in the massacre of a million Armenians between 1915 

and 1923.

<P>

<H3>COST OF FAILING TO FUND-RAISE</H3>

<P>Older campuses with more alumni raise far more money than their newer 

counterparts. UC Berkeley and UCLA attracted as many million-dollar donations 

last year as the other seven campuses combined.

<P>Private fund raising creates disparities among departments as well. Without 

private money, departments have trouble paying for visiting professors and 

research assistants. They lose graduate students when they cannot offer enough 

financial support.

<P>Recently, Atkinson encountered a young anthropology professor struggling to 

find research money.

<P>"She has to scrape by, and students scrape by," Atkinson said. "And yet she 

can look across the campus at someone in computer science and every time they 

turn around, someone is trying to support their program. Those contrasts are 

very tough."

<P>Santa Cruz's astronomy and astrophysics department, which runs Lick 

Observatory on Mount Hamilton, is considered one of the nation's best. But 

just two graduate students decided to join the department last fall. Many 

declined to enroll because comparable private schools offered them more 

fellowship money.

<P>"It has gotten dire," said Stanford Woosley, department chairman. Woosley 

said he doesn't know how to court private donors.

<P>"I'm not very good at going and asking somebody to give me money, 

particularly if I don't know them very well," he said.

<P>

<H3>GROWTH OF CORPORATE INFLUENCE</H3>

<P>In reaching out to corporate America, fund-raisers bring companies -- and 

sometimes controversy -- into the universities.

<P>After the pharmaceutical company Novartis donated $25 million to UC 

Berkeley's department of plant and microbial biology, it was given two of five 

votes on a research committee as well as rights to license and sell some of 

the products of that research. This prompted hearings in the state Senate last 

year into conflict of interest issues, but the corporation ultimately retained 

its seats.

<P>Some departments set up corporate affiliates programs to foster 

relationships with executives. At the Jacobs School of Engineering at UC San 

Diego, members of the affiliates program receive a report on the school's 

financial status, research and education programs during quarterly meetings 

with the dean.

<P>"Our dean is very committed to partnering with industry," said Jeff Nagle, 

external relations program director at the Jacobs school. "I think we take it 

to a new level."

<P>Their approach affects undergraduates such as Will Navaja and classmates 

who spent hours beneath a Nokia banner in the mechanical engineering 

laboratory, designing an automatic cell phone antenna. The work was part of a 

required course that features hands-on design projects sponsored by industry.

<P>"I'd much rather do something for a company than for some (professor) out 

of his file cabinet," said Navaja.

<P>Professor Nate Delson said students benefit from their real-world 

experience but do not profit financially. Nokia budgeted $3,000 for the 

antenna project, Delson said.

<P>

<H3>EFFECT ON CURRICULUM</H3>

<P>Outside funds are shaping more than research agendas. Both individuals and 

industry affect curriculum when they fund academic subjects that interest them.

<P>-- Twelve corporations, including Goldman-Sachs and Morgan Stanley Dean 

Whitter, provided seed money for a new master's degree program in financial 

engineering at the Haas School of Business. The program will produce graduates 

whose training in analysis of financial markets could benefit these firms.

<P>-- Bloomberg LP, a financial news service, provided $585,000 to the 

Graduate School of Journalism at UC Berkeley to start a business reporting 

program.

<P>Some worry about the lack of a clear line delineating just what a private 

donation can purchase at the university.

<P>UC Berkeley history professor Litwack, who came to the campus as an 

undergraduate in 1948, said all donations should be like the one funding his 

endowed chair -- "no strings attached."

<P>He's concerned about partnerships such as the one that had students 

designing a cell phone antenna for Nokia.

<P>"I don't see the university existing for the benefit of corporations," 

Litwack said. ". . .There should never be any corporate influence on the 

curriculum."

<P>UC Santa Cruz computer science professor David Haussler, whose salary is 

paid by the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, acknowledges concerns about 

conflict of interest when private entities start funding academic research, 

but said:

<P>"You don't want to be so adamant about conflict of interest that you 

discourage entrepreneurship among the professors, especially the engineering 

schools, but also the biotech area, especially microbiology. There's a lot of 

exciting things happening with companies."

<H3>BEHIND THE STORY</H3>

This story was reported by students at the University of California at 

Berkeley Graduate School of Journalism and edited by The Chronicle. Part of 

the story is based on a student-conducted survey of fund raising by 

departments in 11 academic areas at the eight University of California 

campuses with undergraduate programs. Eighty-one of 130 departments responded 

to the survey, which was part of a course financed by the Schumann Foundation. 

Data collection was performed by Olga Rodriguez and John Cote of the 

journalism school.
