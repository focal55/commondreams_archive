It's opening night of "Hello Baghdad," and the National Theater's 

thousand-odd seats are filled by the city's well-to-do elite.

<P>  Women in silk blouses and sparkling jewelry settle next to men in Italian 

leather jackets and cashmere pullovers. Ticket prices exclude most Baghdadis 

from attending the performance. At 1,500 Iraqi dinars -- about $1 -- the cost 

is prohibitive.

</P>

<P>  The play's plot centers on a handful of Iraqis -- discouraged by life under 

crippling international sanctions -- who leave their country in search of 

happiness abroad. What they find, though, are offers of menial, denigrating 

work that they have no choice but to accept.

</P>

</font></font></font>"We were never so humiliated in our country, despite the hardships of the 

embargo," says a character named Rwayeeh. With a newfound hope of better times 

ahead, the Iraqis decide to return home. The audience roars its approval.

<P>  Outside the theater, a darker reality play is performed each day throughout 

the nation.

</P>

<P>  On Mutanabi Street in Old Baghdad, booksellers for centuries have earned 

modest livings through sales of the written word. Mohammed Fakhri never 

imagined himself here, selling the books in which he studied drama at Baghdad 

University in the mid-1980s with the goal of appearing one day on stage at the 

National Theater.

</P>

<P>  He abandoned his dream in 1990 after the U.N. Security Council imposed 

sanctions on Iraq following the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, and his nation began 

feeling the pinch of isolation. "I preferred to keep them," he says of his 

books, "but the (economic) necessity of the situation forced me to sell them."

</P>

<P>  Now 40 and single ("I can't afford to marry"), he turns a profit of a 

dollar or two a day -- if he's lucky.

</P>

<P>  "It's hopeless," Fakhri says, his dark, anguished eyes scanning the books 

spread on the sidewalk. "Hopeless and sadness. We just live in this moment and 

there is no future."

</P>

<P>  There is little evidence to argue otherwise. A 1999 UNICEF report noted 

that per capita income in Iraq had fallen from $3,500 in 1989 to less than 

$500 a decade later. Today, 10 years after the Persian Gulf War broke out, 

things have only gotten worse.

</P>

<P>  Before the war, a dollar was worth about three Iraqi dinars; today, the 

same dollar fetches about 1,700 dinars. Although no hard figures are available, most analysts say the national unemployment rate is at least 50 percent.

</P>

<P>  "Economic development has come to a virtual halt," the UNICEF report stated, "and the physical and human capital stock of the country have witnessed 

serious deterioration."

</P>

<P>  That deterioration is plain to see. A country of relative growth and 

prosperity prior to 1990, thanks largely to its oil reserves, Iraq is now a 

place where the income of shoeshine boys and cigarette salesmen routinely 

exceeds that of doctors and teachers. The Iraqi middle class has virtually 

disappeared, its comfortable, pre-sanctions lifestyle long since vaporized by 

an economy in flames.

</P>

<P>  Auction houses are filled with furniture, televisions, refrigerators, even 

centuries-old heirlooms, all the result of families in desperate need of hard 

currency.

</P>

<P>  On the roads and highways, there are few new vehicles, and maintenance is a 

luxury most people can no longer afford. Vehicles sport cracked windshields, 

crumpled bumpers, balding tires and rust-eaten holes the size of footballs. By 

Western standards, most vehicles here are all but screaming for a date with a 

crusher.

</P>

<P>  Abdul Kareem Jasim owns a garage on Baghdad's northern outskirts that 

specializes in wheel alignments. He estimates that at least 60 percent of cars 

on the road are unsafe to drive.

</P>

<P>  "Before the sanctions, if there was any slight problem with the alignment, 

we told the owner he should fix it," he says. "Nowadays, we just ignore it, 

but this is at the expense of safety."

</P>

<P>  Downtown, the indoor Arabic clothing market is teeming with shoulder-to-

shoulder shoppers. Sunshine sneaks through open doors to wash the interior in 

a dusty half-light; the power is out yet again, as it usually is for three or 

four hours a day throughout parts of Baghdad -- just one more obstacle to 

making a buck in Iraq.

</P>

<P>  Before 1990, Iraqis routinely wore clothing from some of the world's best-

known manufacturers. Now, as one shop owner put it, they make do "with the 

worst of the worst." On this day, a pair of Chinese jeans goes for $7, a "top-

end" Iraqi-made women's purse for $6 and a man's Syrian-made sweater for $4.

</P>

<P>  "We face difficulties wherever we turn," says Khatchik Lion, owner of a 

small children's clothing shop in the market. "It's a catastrophe."

</P>

<P>  Lion, an intense, burly chain-smoker in his mid-40s, is seated behind his 

desk, the tip of his cigarette glowing orange in the semi-darkness. He tells 

of routinely selling baby clothing at a loss to parents he senses cannot pay 

more. Sometimes he even gives the clothing away, he says.

</P>

<P>  Later the conversation shifts to sports -- he is also an official with the 

Iraqi Fencing Federation. His eyes roll and fists clench as he recounts how 

Iraqi athletes now are forced to live in a bubble, unable to compete with the 

outside world. Invitations to overseas tournaments continue to come, he says, 

but there is no money to finance such trips.

</P>

<P>  "It's upside down, everything," Lion says. "I'm sorry, but I am angry."

</P>

<P>  His anger, he later explains, is directed not at the people of America or 

elsewhere, but at the governments in Washington and London that maintain the 

sanctions.

</P>

<P>  Everywhere in this crumbling country, the face of Iraqi President Saddam 

Hussein looms. Murals large and small are plastered on walls and billboards. 

Here's Hussein speaking to the masses. Here's Hussein on the phone. Here's 

Hussein garbed in hunting apparel and brandishing a rifle. The message is both 

simple and ominous: Saddam Hussein is everywhere, and he's watching.

</P>

<P>  In more than 20 interviews conducted with ordinary Iraqis, phrases such as 

"the president is doing all he can" and "we're confident in our government" 

were repeated time and again, usually with little or no emotion. All 

interviews were conducted in the presence of a government-appointed minder.

</P>

<P>  Some Iraqis -- perhaps 2 or 3 percent of the population -- are doing just 

fine, despite the economic free-fall.

</P>

<P>  Those inside Hussein's inner circle are not suffering the privations of 

ordinary citizens. As with any besieged economy, there are profiteers, capable 

of turning crises to their advantage by importing hard-to-get, banned items.

</P>

<P>  Then there are people like Khalil Al-Souhaile, born into money. His family 

did quite well in real estate long before Hussein's ill-advised foray into 

Kuwait. He drives an Audi A8 -- "The fastest car on the road," he says with a 

laugh -- and wants for very little.

</P>

<P>  Al-Souhaile, a graduate of McGill University in Montreal, owns an upscale 

restaurant called Castello ("Castle"), where the specialty is filet mignon in 

mustard sauce. It costs about $6.50, roughly a week's pay for most Iraqis 

these days.

</P>

<P>  "I think, for Iraqis, we are living in very interesting times," he says.

</P>

<P>  Thirty employees, including three guards, five chefs and a cleaning crew of 

eight, staff his 75-seat restaurant. "I'm overstaffed," he admits, but says 

that he often finds -- or creates -- a place for someone desperate for a job.

</P>

<P>  "If you are a decent human being," Al-Souhaile says, "then it's very 

difficult to put a chunk of food in your mouth when you know someone else is 

suffering. The only comfort you get is that you know you're not responsible 

for it."

</P>

<P>  Four hours north of Baghdad, in Mosul, 36-year-old Tarak Abdullah is well 

acquainted with suffering. He spends his days on the street, selling plastic 

bags of a dark liquid that he says is the juice of dried lemons.

</P>

<P>  Asked to describe life in his country these days, Abdullah thinks for a 

moment, then answers slowly, but firmly, "The situation we are in is worse 

than death."
