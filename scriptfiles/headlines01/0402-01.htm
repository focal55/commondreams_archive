OTTAWA - Protesters preparing to do peaceful battle at the Summit of the Americas gathered in the unlikely setting of Parliament Hill's historic rooms and marble hallways yesterday to learn some civil disobedience tricks.

</table>Under the close watch of House of Commons security guards, high school student Shelagh Roxborough and some 250 other activists took turns playing both demonstrators and police wielding newspaper batons.

<P></P>

``I want to know what to be prepared for,'' said Roxborough.

<P></P>

At 17, she has been involved in small protests before - but nothing like the huge demonstrations expected in Quebec city later this month.

<P></P>

She's preparing carefully - even reading up on how lemon juice can help combat the stinging effects of pepper spray. 

<P></P>

But the civil disobedience training left her nervous.

<P></P>

``It just reinforced how awful it is to have that tension. I'm going to avoid that at all costs,'' said Roxborough. ``I wouldn't want to rush to the front line.''

<P></P>

The workshop stressed non-violent action, but Roxborough said even mock confrontations staged yesterday showed how easily tempers can flare.

<P></P>

Trainer George Lakey, an American who has led similar workshops for groups as diverse as London anarchists to South Africa's African National Congress, told the group yesterday that peaceful protest is about creative strength, not brawn.

<P></P>

``It's much more about body language and spirit than it is about size,'' Lakey told a petite university student worried her tiny frame would be no match for police.

<P></P>

Lakey's arrival in Ottawa on Friday night attracted the attention of Canadian immigration officials, who detained him for four hours.

<P></P>

The leaders of 34 nations in the Western Hemisphere will gather behind barriers in Quebec city April 20 to 22, to discuss the proposed Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA).

<P></P>

</table>Organizers have said up to 6,000 police officers will be monitoring a 4.5 kilometre security perimeter to keep protesters away from the heads of state.

<P></P>

This morning, many trainees from yesterday's session planned to gather outside the Ottawa headquarters of Canada's trade department to try to seize the secret text of the proposed FTAA, which would create a free trade zone from Alaska to the Antarctic.

<P></P>

The protest is to draw attention to the fact Canadians aren't allowed to see the details of what's being negotiated.

<P></P>

But the focus of protesters won't be just in Ottawa. Activists are gearing up to protest at tomorrow's meeting of Western Hemisphere finance minsters in Toronto.

<P></P>

The two-day meeting, which includes ministers from more than 30 nations in North and South America, paves the way for the Quebec summit.

<P></P>

U.S. Treasury officials said the agenda would include discussions on economic growth policies in the Western Hemisphere as well as in Europe and Asia.
