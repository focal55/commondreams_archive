            Fresh revelations about Italian police brutality at Genoa's G8 summit 

            emerged last night when 20 anti-globalization protesters were released 

            from jail.

                  American student Susanna Thomas addresses journalists in Milan's 

                  Linate airport, late Tuesday, Aug. 14, 2001, after being released 

                  from an Italian prison. Thomas, 21, of Warren, N.J., and member 

                  of the pacifist Christian Quakers, was arrested July 22 outside 

                  of Genoa with an Austrian theater group that had been staging 

                  performances during the Group of Eight summit. The German writing 

                  on her T-shirt says: &quot;Freedom for all political prisoners.&quot;

</table></font>Police doctors participated in the torture, humiliation, threats 

              of rape and deprivation of water, food, sleep and medical care inflicted 

              on those detained in the wake of last month's riots, they said. 

            <P>Most of the released were part of Austrian group Publix Theatre, 

              whose skits about hardline Black Bloc anarchists were allegedly 

              mistaken by police for the real thing. 

            <P>A Genoa court released the 15 Austrians, three Americans, a Slovak 

              and a Swede, but said they may yet face charges for public order 

              offenses.

            <P>One rioter was killed and more than 300 protesters injured during 

              the summit. 

            <P>Stefania Galante, 29, of Padova, was forced to stand spread-eagled 

              against the cell wall for two hours while guards insulted and intimidated 

              fellow detainees. "They were threatening girls who didn't have their 

              legs open, telling them they would be raped with the clubs. It was 

              surreal. I couldn't believe it was happening. 

            <P>"It looked like we were either back in time, or in some other country, 

              in some other reality. Seeing that happen in Italy was unbelievable." 

            <P>Most of the complaints focused on Bolzaneto, a barracks used for 

              hundreds of detainees, including those beaten up during a police 

              raid on the protesters' headquarters. 

            <P>Genoa officials are investigating possible "improper behavior" 

              by doctors. 

            <P>Jose Luis Sicilia, from Spain, said he was forced to undress and 

              do push-ups when he arrived at Bolzaneto even though he had two 

              broken ribs and a head wound. 

            <P>"One day they entered with an electrocardiogram machine and they 

              started to wet my chest and ankles while a policeman was smiling 

              saying to me 'electroshocks, electroshocks'."
