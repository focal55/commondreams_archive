WASHINGTON  - U.S. Labor Secretary Elaine Chao

failed to reveal on her financial disclosure form that she was

a board member of privately held Multa Communications Corp.,

which operates a high-speed Internet backbone, according to

documents examined on Monday.

<p>California-based Multacom said it operates in the United

States, China and Taiwan and offers high-speed Internet access,

virtual private networks, data centers, Web hosting and Web

development services.

<p>Chao, a Taiwanese immigrant, was sworn in as the labor

chief on Jan. 31, but a Multacom spokesman said she resigned

her board position on March 1, a month after she took the reins

of the agency that oversees protecting workers' wages,

workplace health and safety as well as job training.

<p>A review of Chao's disclosure form, filed on Jan. 29 with

the U.S. Office of Government Ethics, shows 28 positions held

outside the government, including director's chairs at Dole

Food Co. Inc. and the Nasdaq stock market.

<p>She did not include any reference to Multacom.

<p>Nominees to head government departments must fill out a

public financial disclosure report that outlines their assets,

liabilities, compensation and positions outside the U.S.

government and is available to the public.

<p>The form specifically requires the disclosure of all

previous positions, paid or unpaid.

<p>Chao was on the company's board since July 1, 2000,

according to a January press release issued by Multacom when

President Bush  nominated her to be Labor Secretary.

<p>The failure by Chao, who is married to Kentucky Republican

Sen. Mitch McConnell, to reveal the position at Multacom was

first reported by The New Republic magazine.

<p>Telephone calls seeking comment from Chao's spokesman were

not immediately returned, and it was not clear whether she was

paid for her service on the board. Two calls to company

officials were also not returned.

<p>``An innocent omission or forgetting would not really be

the kind of thing that would trigger a penalty,'' said James

O'Sullivan, a spokesman for the ethics office, speaking

generally about the disclosure forms.

<p>However, a penalty could be imposed if it were determined a

person falsified or knowingly omitted information, he said.

<p>Chao was President Bush's second pick for the slot, behind

Linda Chavez who withdrew amid staunch opposition from labor

groups and the revelation that an illegal immigrant had lived

and worked in her home since 1991.
