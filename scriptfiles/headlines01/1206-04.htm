MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia warned the United States on

Thursday against unilateral moves to dump a landmark pact

banning missile defense, saying it could destabilize the

international situation already tense due to Afghanistan .

<p>Deputy Foreign Minister Georgy Mamedov told visiting U.S.

Under-Secretary of State John Bolton that a move by the United

States to leave the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty would be

a mistake, the Foreign Ministry said in a statement.

<p>``During the talks the Russian side once again noted the

negative consequences for international stability of any U.S.

decision to unilaterally leave the 1972 ABM treaty, which is

supported by the vast majority of countries,'' it said.

<p>``It would be particularly dangerous given the current

difficult international situation,'' the communique said, a

clear reference to the U.S.-led military campaign in

Afghanistan.

<p>The U.S. embassy was unavailable for comment on the meeting

between Mamedov and Bolton, who arrived in Moscow to prepare

this weekend's talks in the Russian capital between Secretary

of State Colin Powell  and senior Russian officials.

<p>The United States and Russia, legal successor to treaties

signed by the Soviet Union, can give six months notice to quit

the ABM pact.

<p>But while Russia sees it as the keystone of strategic

stability -- it provided the basis for more than 30 other arms

control accords -- President Bush views the treaty as a relic

of the Cold War era.

<p>The ABM treaty bans the sort of shield that Bush wants to

build to protect the United States from attacks by so-called

''rogue states'' like North Korea, Iraq, Iran and Libya. Moscow

partly shares Washington's concerns but says the danger is

exaggerated and that international terrorism poses a more

pressing threat. However, the two sides have agreed to pursue

talks on the issue in tandem with deep cuts to their nuclear

arsenals. The exact scope and nature of those nuclear warhead

reductions have yet to be thrashed out.

<p>Defense analysts believe a possible compromise could see

Washington offer arsenal cuts nearer the lower end of the

2,200-1,700 range on the table, while allowing missile defense

testing and retaining the ABM treaty in some form.

<p>Moscow's muted reaction to this week's successful downing

of a dummy warhead on a ballistic missile over the Pacific

Ocean, suggested the two sides, partners in the war on

terrorism launched after September's attacks on U.S. cities,

are still searching for a compromise.
