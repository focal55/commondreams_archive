PORTO ALEGRE, Brazil  - The World Social Forum opened
Thursday as its hosts launched an appeal for greater social
justice and international solidarity, a sentiment underscored by a
march of thousands through this Brazilian city, and captured by a
throng of 1,600 journalists. 
<P>
   Black women as presidents of Brazil and the United States, and
Indians governing Guatemala and Peru,  symbolise the equality
envisioned for the near future, according to a text read by an
actress at the opening ceremonies, which included pulsating
African rhythms for a spectacle of banners created by the
unemployed and the landless. 
<P>

</TABLE></font></font></font>The World Social Forum (WSF) opens the possibility of promoting
''integration among people and not among merchandise,'' said
Olivio Dutra, governor of Rio Grande do Sul, as he saluted the
delegates of non-governmental organisations (NGOs), trade unions,
social movements and leftist politicians gathered in this southern
Brazilian city. 
<P>
   Beginning with this Forum, which is to be held every year, we
hope to build ''a humanity of greater solidarity, closer to
freedom and on its way to equality,'' affirmed Tarso Genro, mayor
of Porto Alegre, the capital of Rio Grande do Sul. 
<P>
   Representatives from more than 120 countries will be meeting in
the city through next Tuesday, ''to prove that another world is
possible,'' stated the editor of the French newspaper 'Le Monde
Diplomatique,' Bernard Cassen, who serves on the organising
committee as one of the masterminds behind the event. 
<P>
   The WSF is an attempt to counterbalance the World Economic
Forum, which also began Thursday, though across the Atlantic in
the Swiss alpine resort city of Davos.   
<P>
   The annual conference there draws corporate executives (from
the 1,000 largest transnational firms), financiers and government
leaders to debate neoliberal policies that seek to deepen the
current globalisation process.

</TABLE></font></font></font>The Porto Alegre conference is an expression of opposition to
the ''Darwinist vision of human relations and of a society treated
like a jungle,'' one that is fed by the ''neoliberalism of
Davos,'' maintained governor Dutra. 
<P>
   The realities the WSF must work to change, he said, are the
minimum government for the majority while the greater government
serves a few powerful groups, and use of technological advances
only ''to accumulate and concentrate wealth,'' instead of
improving humanity's standard of living. 
<P>
   An estimated 2,000 people crowded into the auditorium at the
local Catholic University to attend the inaugural session.
Beginning tomorrow, 16 panels and 408 workshops will be held, in
which participants will discuss a broad range of topics. 
<P>
   The intense applause and shouts of support heard when Cuba was
mentioned among the 123 countries participating in the WSF made
the leftist orientation of the conference clear. 
<P>
   The enthusiasm can also by explained by the fact that the Party
of Workers (PT), Brazil's leading force of the political left, has
governed Porto Alegre for the last two years. Its members include
Genro and Dutra, the hosts for this first WSF. 
<P>
   The strongest delegation here is probably the French, in part
because of the crucial support 'Le Monde Diplomatique' has
provided the WSF. 
<P>
   But also because France has star representatives, including
Danielle Mitterrand, former First Lady of France and current
president of the France Liberté Association, and farmer-unionist
José Bové, famous for his protests against the globalisation
represented by the McDonald's fast-food chain. 
<P>
   In addition, the French government sent two of its ministers to
Porto Alegre, Guy de Hascoet, of the economic solidarity ministry,
and François Huwart, of foreign trade. 
<P>
   At a meeting that was clearly left leaning, Oded Grajew,
coordinator of the Brazilian Association of Entrepreneurs for the
Citizenry, felt right at home. ''If only all entrepreneurs were
leftists,'' he told IPS, saying it is this political sector that
fights for social justice and solidarity. 
<P>
   ''The world must change its economic development model,'' for
both social and environmental reasons, observed the businessman,
who also heads the Ethos Institute, which calls for greater social
responsibility in the business world through taking part in
programmes to fight poverty and inequality. 
<P>
   Changing the economic route the world is following ''is a
question of everyone's survival,'' evidenced by the ecological
disaster of rapid global warming, Grajew pointed out. 
<P>
   ''We have to accomplish in three or four years what Davos did
in 30 years,'' stressed Cándido Grzybowski, director-general of
the Brazilian Institute of Socio-Economic Analysis, one of the
NGOs on the event's organising committee.

</TABLE></font></font></font>The challenge is not just to counterbalance Davos, but also
''to be bold enough to think, to create an affirmative wave of
action and a different kind of globalisation,'' one that is based
on society and sustainable human development, not on the profit-
seeking of financial and corporate conglomerates, he explained. 
<P>
   Economic, social and cultural rights, food security, the
defining of common ownership - over water, for example -, and the
''older issues'' like agrarian reform and sustainable cities, will
be among the essential matters of ''the possible world'' that will
be discussed over the next five days, and beyond, said Grzybowski.
