NEW YORK  - A group of prominent African-Americans has

challenged

the electoral victory of Republican President-elect George W. Bush

after a

ballot exercise marked by numerous charges of selective

disenfranchisement of

black voters.  

<P>

Denouncing what they described as ''massive voting

irregularities'' in the

November polls, eight prominent black leaders have vowed to

aggressively

contest two of Bush's cabinet nominations, to protest his

inauguration on Jan.

20, and to pursue comprehensive electoral reform in the courts and

in

Congress. <P>

A ''national emergency summit'' was announced for Thursday at

Howard

University

in Washington, which will involve the National Association for the

Advancement

of Coloured People, the Nation of Islam, the National Urban

League, and other

leading African American groups.  <P>

''The Center for Constitutional Rights is committed to opposing

the legitimacy

of this regime, which was born of the disenfranchisement of

millions of people

in this country,'' said Ron Daniels, the Center's executive

director, who

organised a panel Tuesday at a forum titled 'From Protest to

Democracy' in

Washington DC.  <P>

''It is our duty to resist,'' said Daniels, calling for a broad-

based protest

on Jan. 20 - the date of President-elect Bush's inauguration - at

''the scene

of the crime, the Supreme Court of the United States''.  <P>

Rev. Al Sharpton, whose National Action Network is also organising

a ''shadow

inauguration'', said the march would not solve the problem, but it

would

''dramatically show the world that we're not suffering from

amnesia''.  <P>

''Some say that it's over, that it's time to move on,'' he said,

adding,

''It's

not over.''  <P>

At Tuesday's event at the National Press Club, panellists cited

mounting

evidence that large numbers of African Americans had their ballots

thrown out

because of confusing instructions and faulty voting equipment - or

were

discouraged from voting at all.  <P>

In Florida, nearly 10,000 ballots cast by heavily Democratic-

leaning black

voters were disqualified. These spoiled ballots had a crucial

impact on the

election since Bush won Florida by a mere 537 votes, and winning

Florida gave

him the presidency under the electoral college system, even though

he lost the

popular vote.  <P>

''We're worried about Florida because the fulcrum ended up there,

but what we

really need to do is go state by state, precinct by precinct, and

look at all

the ways in which people were disenfranchised,'' said Dr. Julianne

Malveaux, a

prominent African American journalist.  <P>

A partial analysis by the Washington Post recently found that the

problems

were

not limited to Florida.  <P>

Black areas of Alabama, for example, had one in every 16 ballots

thrown out

due

to errors, while the invalidation rate for black neighbourhoods in

Chicago,

Illinois rose to one in six - much, much higher than the rates in

white

precincts. Both places were using old-fashioned machines that

require

voters to

punch holes in a card, which can produce marred ballots if the

bits of paper

stick - the infamous ''hanging chads'' and ''pregnant chads''.  <P>

The discrepancy between votes cast and votes counted is called the

''drop-off

rate'' by statisticians. Although the average national drop-off

rate in 1996

was 2.08 percent, according to research by Scripps Howard News

Service, it was

more than twice that in areas with a majority of African American

and Latino

voters.  <P>

Other problems cited in the November election included confusion

over voter

registration rolls and polling places, police harassment, and the

misclassification of thousands of people as convicted felons, who

are barred

from voting in many states.  <P>

Speakers at the meeting also expressed grave concern over the

nomination of

former Missouri Senator John Ashcroft for attorney-general, a key

civil rights

post.  <P>

In 1998, Ashcroft told an extremist publication called Southern

Partisan that

''your magazine also helps set the record straight. You've got a

heritage of

doing that, of defending southern patriots like [Robert E.] Lee,

[Stonewall]

Jackson and Jefferson [Davis]''.  <P>

''Traditionalists must do more. I've got to do more,'' Ashcroft

said in the

interview. ''We've all got to stand up and speak in this respect,

or else

we'll

be taught that these people were giving their lives, subscribing

their sacred

fortunes and their honour to some perverted agenda'' - meaning

slavery.  <P>

Southern Partisan has described David Duke, a former Klansman who

made a bid

for the US Senate, as ''a Populist spokesperson for a recapturing

of the

American ideal''.  <P>

Ashcroft has yet to pass muster in the Senate, and Rev. Jesse

Jackson of the

Rainbow/PUSH coalition is leading the charge to block his

appointment by

aggressively lobbying Democratic lawmakers - who currently make up

half the

Senate - to vote against confirmation.  <P>

Another contested nomination is that of Christine Todd Whitman,

the

governor of

New Jersey, to head the Environmental Protection Agency. Whitman

presided over

a massive police racism scandal, prompting Al Sharpton to refer to

her as the

''queen of racial profiling''.  <P>

''At a time when we espouse the values of democracy around the

world, we

cannot

tolerate the dishonest and chicanery to suppress the vote of

African American

citizens,'' said Rev. Walter Fauntroy, a former congressman for

the

District of

Columbia and president of the National Black Leadership

Roundtable.  <P>

''We have a challenge as people of conscience to move this nation

toward the

principles that we enunciate but failed to live up to on Nov. 7,''

he said.  <P>

In addition to the ''Day of Resistance'' on Jan. 20, Fauntroy said

that

efforts

would be made to get out the vote in upcoming legislative races.

He also

expected the public airing of voter complaints before the federal

Civil Rights

Commission headed by Mary Frances Berry, a push for uniform voting

standards,

and ongoing lawsuits.  <P>

In a discussion of alternatives to the current winner-take-all

system,

Columbia

University Professor and syndicated columnist Manning Marable

advocated

''instant run-off voting'', in which voters indicate a second

choice on the

ballot. If no candidate receives 50 percent, the candidates with

the least

votes are knocked off and their votes reassigned to the two front-

runners.  <P>

''It would not require a constitutional amendment,'' Prof. Marable

explained.

''You can vote for the person you want, and not end up with the

person you

hate

the most'' - a reference to Ralph Nader supporters handing the

election to

Bush.  <P>

Other speakers included Laura Murphy, executive director of the

legislative

bureau of the American Civil Liberties Union, Dr. Ramona Edelin,

executive

director of the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation, and

Benjamin Jealous,

executive director of the National Newspaper Publishers

Association, the

nation's only black wire service.  <P>

''We tend to take our own oppression for granted,'' Jealous said.

''Our

commitment is to make sure that black young people understand that

we won this

election.''
