ST. PAUL -- Dozens of protesters jammed a downtown street corner Thursday morning as President Bush visited St. Paul to promote his new energy policy.

<P>Representing Greenpeace&#44;      the Sierra Club and other environmental groups&#44;      the protesters blared rock music&#44;      chanted slogans and waved signs outside the RiverCentre complex&#44;      where Bush was to speak. </P>

<P>Some of the signs read: &#34;     Save the Arctic&#44;     &#34;      &#34;     Give us clean energy&#44;      not polluted power&#44;     &#34;      &#34;     No Nukes&#34;      and &#34;     Count the Vote.&#34;      </P>

<P>The protest was peaceful and drew people of all ages&#44;      including mothers carrying children on their backs and senior citizens. </P>

<P>In a bit of street theater&#44;      some protesters walked around with surgical masks labeled CO2 masks  --        a reference to carbon dioxide&#44;      which has been blamed for global warning  --        while others wore caricatured George Bush masks. </P>

<P>&#34;     His secret energy commission that was headed by Vice President Cheney is really creepy&#44;     &#34;      said Pat Nevin&#44;      an attorney from St. Paul who took a vacation day to join the protests. She was also bothered by Bush&#39;     s show of support for St. Paul Mayor Norm Coleman&#44;      who&#39;     s expected to seek the GOP nomination to run against Democratic Sen. Paul Wellstone. </P>

<P>&#34;I think it&#39;     s disgusting that he came to Minnesota and he&#39;     s trying to get his oily hands all over Paul Wellstone&#44;     &#34;      Nevin said </P>

<P>But not all those gathered were against Bush. </P>

<P>Susan Manson&#44;      a nurse from Minneapolis&#44;      came to the rally straight from work. Holding a sign that said &#34;     Bush for Minnesotans&#44;     &#34;      she said she liked the president&#39;     s plan to boost energy supplies. </P>

<P>&#34;     I think that we do need more energy sources&#44;     &#34;      Manson said. &#34;     I think he wants to conserve&#44;      but he also wants not to be under the Arabs&#39;      dominion.&#34;      </P>

<P>Bush was in St. Paul to tour District Energy&#44;      a company that uses a combination of conventional fuels&#44;      like coal and oil&#44;      and biomass  --        in this case&#44;      waste wood  --        to heat and cool 146 downtown buildings and 300 nearby homes to boot. </P>

<P>District Energy is expanding its use of renewable energy and hopes to begin creating and selling biomass-generated electricity by December 2002. </P>
