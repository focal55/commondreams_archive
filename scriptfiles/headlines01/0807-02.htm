A Colombian judge has ruled that the authorities may resume spraying pesticides to destroy illegal drugs on land belonging to indigenous Indians.

</table>In an earlier ruling, circuit judge Gilberto Reyes had said that chemicals used in the US drug eradication program violated the right to life and the environment of those on Indian reserves.

<P>The spraying of drug crops in Colombia - both coca and poppy, the raw materials for cocaine and heroin - is the centerpiece of the US war against drugs in the region. 

<P>

Colombia produces more than 80% of the world's cocaine, and is the single largest supplier of heroin to the US. 

<P>

Opposition to the fumigation has been growing in Colombia along with the scale of the spraying - more than 50,000 hectares so far this year alone. 

<P>

Opponents insist that the spraying of the glyphosate weed killer is harming people and the environment.

<P>

<B>US pressure</B>

<P>

Their call for a suspension to the fumigation has been echoed by the United Nations and the World Health Organization.

<P>

But the US threatened to cut off aid if the fumigation program was halted.

<P>Through its ambassador to Colombia, Anne Patterson, huge pressure was placed on the Colombian Government to get the decision reversed. 

<P>

Senator Rafael Orduz, a leading opponent of the fumigation, lamented the decision.

<P>

He said that spraying over the last decade had achieved nothing, and that more drug crops than ever were under cultivation - an assertion supported by US figures. 

<P>

Mr Orduz insists that the Colombian peasants who grow the drug crops - most of whom live in poverty - should be offered real alternatives.

<P>

He also says the US should do something about its demand for drugs before pouring weed killer on Colombia. 

<P>

According to the US Drug Enforcement Agency, the demand for illegal drugs in the United States last year totaled over $60bn.
