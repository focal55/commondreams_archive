The World Bank is set to approve next week a $15 million loan to a

financial intermediary to provide subcontracting services to Shell Oil

Corporation in the Niger Delta of Nigeria. Already the <a href="http://www.ips-dc.org/">Institute for

Policy Studies</a> and <a href="http://www.foe.org/">Friends of the Earth</a> have denounced the plan to allot

hard currency to banks in the Niger Delta, who could then lend to Shell

Oil -- a company notorious for oil spills which have ruined the lives of

fisherman and farmers in the area. Internal documents from the

International Finance Corporation (IFC) reveal that the IFC recognize

this association with Shell as a “reputational risk” to the World Bank.

<p>



“This loan sets an alarming precedent for a number of reasons,” says

Daphne Wysham, an energy policy analyst with the <a href="http://www.ips-dc.org/">Institute for Policy

Studies</a>. “It is being prepared without any accountability to World Bank

policies, and it will provide support to one of the wealthiest and most

controversial corporations on the planet in a region where human rights

abuses continue to be commonplace.”

<p>



Wysham continued by implicating other threats that are almost sure to

result. “Rather than alleviating poverty among the people of the Delta,

this project will simply continue the pattern of environmental

devastation, corruption, human rights abuse and corporate subsidies that

have plagued the region for decades,” she warned.

<p>



Additionally, deputy director for international programs with <a href="http://www.foe.org/">Friends of

the Earth</a> Carol Welch said, “This debacle reveals why we need serious

scrutiny of all World Bank oil, gas and mining projects.”

<p>



Since 1993, consumer boycotts, human rights and environmental campaigns

have branded Shell’s reputation. The transnational company was even

forced to cease operations in the Ogoni region of the Niger Delta after

widespread protests by the Ogoni people, who have been plagued by

constant oil spills. The most recent Shell spill occurred on May 9 of

this year, and the CIA has divulged that years of spills in the Niger

Delta, which have yet to be cleaned up, amount to the equivalent of ten

times the Alaskan Exxon Valdez oil spill.

<p>



Nonetheless, the IFC plans to approve the loan via a streamlined process

wherein the project would not require an environmental impact assessment

or adherence to any World Bank policy or guideline.  The World Bank

plans to launch a review of their oil, gas and mining sectors this

fall.  It is not clear whether projects such as this loan would be part

of the review process.
