WASHINGTON   - Ecuadorian Indians are taking legal

action in federal court here, charging that a U.S. company

contracted to carry out fumigation of illicit crops in

neighbouring Colombia recklessly sprayed their homes and farms,

causing illnesses and deaths, and destroying crops. 

<P>

U.S.-based attorneys representing 10,000 individuals living in the

Amazon rainforest near the border with Colombia filed a class

action complaint against Virginia-based DynCorp Corporation in

federal court here Sep. 11. <P>

A DynCorp spokesperson said the company has not been notified

about the complaint and declined to comment further. <P>

The legal complaint is the latest in a series of actions brought

under the Alien Tort Claims Act, which allows foreign citizens to

sue U.S. companies in courts here over acts committed abroad. <P>

''The spraying of a toxic herbicide over people and land is a

stupid and reckless action,'' said Terry Collingsworth of the

International Labour Rights Fund here, one of the lead counsels in

the case. <P>

In addition to charging DynCorp with violating the Alien Tort

Claims Act, the complaint alleges the company also breached the

U.S. Torture Victim Protection Act, among others. It seeks

millions of dollars in compensation and an immediate halt to

spraying that allegedly affects Ecuador. <P>

The complaint also calls into question 'Plan Colombia', the U.S.-

funded strategy to combat narcotics launched last year by

Colombian President Andres Pastrana. <P>

Plan Colombia involves 7.5 billion dollars for social and economic

development and 1.3 billion dollars, pledged by the United States,

mostly for military equipment and training, and aerial fumigation

of illicit coca, marijuana, and poppy crops. <P>

Colombian politicians and officials have said that although they

favour eradicating narcotics crops, a new strategy is needed

because fumigation with the herbicide glyphosate is causing

illnesses, destroying pastures and food crops, poisoning

livestock, and displacing thousands of small farmers. <P>

In March and July, Colombian legislators and governors came here

and told reporters that fumigation was not hurting the narcotics

industry but severely harming poor farming families. They said

planes spraying the crops blanket entire communities with the

herbicide and cause poor farmers to suffer illnesses and skin

problems. <P>

Indigenous leaders in Colombia also have voiced opposition to the

spraying. <P>

Last year, Emperatriz Cahuache, president of the Organisation of

Indigenous Peoples of the Colombian Amazon, came to Washington and

showed reporters a map illustrating how the areas of coca and

marijuana cultivation overlaps with indigenous territories and the

areas that have been fumigated. <P>

''These fumigations are contaminating the Amazon and destroying

the forest,'' said Cahuache. <P>

Proponents of Plan Colombia said glyphosate, marketed by the U.S.-

based Monsanto company under the trade name 'Roundup', is as safe

as salt. Critics countered that directions on glyphosate labels

warn users not to allow the product to come into contact with

people or water sources. <P>

The lawsuit against DynCorp is the second time that indigenous

communities in the Ecuadorian Amazon have used the Alien Tort

Claims Act to sue a U.S. company in U.S. court for allegedly

endangering human health and destroying crops. <P>

In 1993, a group of Ecuadorian indigenous people filed a class

action suit against the Texaco oil company, charging that during

two decades of drilling in the Amazon, it dumped more than 3,000

gallons of crude oil into the rainforest. <P>

The plaintiffs claimed that the company ignored oil industry

standards and, instead of re-injecting the waste back into the

ground, dumped a toxic cocktail of chemicals into unlined pits

that eventually leached into streams and rivers. <P>

Their lawsuit is still pending in federal court in New York. <P>

Cristobal Bonifaz, a Massachusetts-based attorney originally from

Ecuador, is one of the lead attorneys in the case against Texaco.

He is also a lead counsel representing Ecuadorians in the new

action against DynCorp. <P>

Bonifaz said he became aware of the alleged fumigation in Ecuador

after communication with his clients in the lawsuit against the

oil company. <P>

''In the same region where Texaco devastated the environment and

caused untold suffering to the people of the rainforest, a new

enemy now comes from the air, poisoning the people, killing their

crops, and destroying their land,'' said Bonifaz.
