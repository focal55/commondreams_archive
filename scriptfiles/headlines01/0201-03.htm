President Bush has had another run-in with an open microphone, unwittingly airing candid comments about abortion and Republicans.
<p>
In another embarrassing run-in with an open microphone, President Bush's made remarkably candid remarks on abortion and Republicans that were unwittingly broadcast to the White House press this week.
<p>Speaking to leaders of Roman Catholic charities, Bush expressed frustration that the debate over letting parents use federal aid to put their children in private and parochial schools is such an uphill "battle." Bush said the issue is a "problem politically," adding that his proposal was being doomed by Republicans in wealthy suburbs who are "scared to death" of offending public school supporters.
<p>It's a fight he intends to win, Bush said, by avoiding the term "vouchers," instead advocating "opportunity scholarships" that would let students leave failing schools.
<p>It's not unlike the abortion issue, President Bush suggested to the Catholics, which is better argued as a "pro-life" position.
<p>"It's like the abortion issue," Bush said. "There is a built in prejudice against a particular position on both sides of both issues. And the language of the issues, you know, is never 'for' life. It's always 'anti,' you know. Somebody's right. And same in education. And those of us who agree on these issues must figure out better ways to position it from a PR perspective."
<p>Bush was apparently unaware the microphone was on when he made the comments. The mic had been set up for comments to be made to reporters during a photo session with the Catholic leaders, but was turned on early -- before reporters were allowed into the meeting -- and broadcast to the press room.
<p>Addressing an archbishop from Miami, Bush joked that he was planning to name his brother, Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida, "the ambassador to Chad."
<p>The double-entendre referred to battle Bush and Democratic presidential candidate Al Gore waged over how exactly chad, the tiny pieces of paper that dangle off ballots, should have been read during the election contest.
<p>It's not Bush's first mishap with a microphone. During the campaign, he and vice-presidential candidate Dick Cheney made vulgar comments about a <i>New York Times</i> reporter that were mistakenly broadcast over the PA system at a campaign rally.
