LONDON   - Human rights group Amnesty International

on Tuesday called for an inquiry into reports that hundreds of

Afghan fighters have been killed in clashes since the weekend

in northern Afghanistan.

<p>The London-based organization urged the anti-Taliban

Northern Alliance, the United States and Britain to investigate

the clashes within the Qala-i-Jhangi, a fort on the outskirts

of Mazar-i-Sharif.

<p>After negotiating a surrender, hundreds of foreign troops

fighting with the Taliban were escorted from the town of Kunduz

to the fort by the Northern Alliance last weekend.

<p>The circumstances surrounding the fighting that followed

were still not clear, although some prisoners are reported to

have overpowered guards and seized firearms, according to

Amnesty.

<p>British and U.S. special forces were reported to have been

involved in the fighting, including by directing U.S. air

strikes, an Amnesty statement said.

<p>It said an urgent inquiry should look into what triggered

the violent incident, including any shortcomings in the holding

and processing of prisoners, and into the response by Northern

Alliance, U.S. and British forces.

<p>``It should make urgent recommendations to ensure that other

instances of surrender and holding of prisoners do not lead to

similar disorders and loss of life,'' Amnesty said.

<p>It should also ensure that the key role of the

International Committee of the Red Cross in overseeing the

processing and treatment of prisoners is facilitated.

<p>``The outcome of this inquiry, and any disciplinary or other

measures that may be taken against anyone found responsible for

wrongdoing, should be made public,'' the statement concluded.
