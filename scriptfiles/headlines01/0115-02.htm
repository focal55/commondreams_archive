IT'S NOT every governor that goes scuba diving in Australia with 

lobbyists for Philip Morris Cos., the tobacco industry giant.

<P>  Gov. Tommy Thompson, President-elect George Bush's nominee to head the 

Department of Health and Human Services, had that pleasure in 1996 when he and 

Minnesota Gov. Arne Carlson, along with several Philip Morris employees, took 

the plunge off Australia's coral reef.

</P>

<P>  So far, most attention has been focused on Thompson's anti-abortion views, 

but little has been paid to his close ties to the tobacco industry -- ties 

which have some tobacco-control advocates deeply worried. "We believe he will 

be a disaster for public health," said Stanton Glantz, a professor at the 

Cardiovascular Research Institute at the University of California at San 

Francisco.

</P>

<P>  In 1998, Glantz and co-researcher Fred Monardi attempted the near 

impossible -- finding a scientific way to measure the connection between 

tobacco contributions and public policy. After conducting a complex 

statistical analysis, Glantz issued a 33-page study titled "Tobacco Industry 

Political Activity and Tobacco Control Policy-Making in Wisconsin: 1983-1998."

</P>

<P>  Their conclusion: "The tobacco industry is a major political and legal 

force in Wisconsin through campaign contributions, lobbying and litigation." 

As for Thompson, they found that "compared to governors in other states we 

have studied -- California, Washington, Pennsylvania, Ohio and New Jersey -- 

Thompson has a very close relationship with the tobacco industry." Lest anyone 

think the UCSF researchers had a political motive, the report was published 

long before Bush was even a candidate for president, let alone thinking about 

putting Thompson in his Cabinet.

</P>

<P>  Between 1993 and 2000, Thompson received $72,000 in campaign contributions 

either directly from Philip Morris, or from its subsidiaries and their 

employees. In the 1990s, Thompson also went on three trips, valued at $16,000, 

sponsored by the National Governor's Association and organized by nonprofit 

organizations substantially funded by Philip Morris, including the one to 

Australia.

</P>

<P>  Thompson said he did not know about Philip Morris' involvement until after 

the trip. Yet within weeks of returning he sent a letter to Philip Morris 

lobbyist John Lenzi, telling him he was "especially grateful that you agreed 

to take the scuba diving plunge with me" and encouraging him to stop by his 

office the next time he came to Madison.

</P>

<P>  Glantz said the tobacco-sponsored junkets are not as innocuous as they 

might seem. "We know from reading industry documents that they don't fly these 

people around the world because they want to get them frequent-flier miles," 

he said.

</P>

<P>  He and others contend that the record clearly shows that Thompson has been 

a less than enthusiastic supporter of tobacco-control efforts."Wisconsin has 

not been as aggressive as it could or should have been in initiating or 

supporting tobacco-control programs throughout his tenure as governor," said 

Paul Billings of the American Lung Association.

</P>

<P>  When Thompson goes to Capitol Hill this week for his confirmation hearings, 

he must be pressed on several critical issues. Will he curtail the Food and 

Drug Administration's aggressive attempts to regulate tobacco products? What 

programs will he support at the Centers for Disease Control to prevent tobacco-

related disease? What relevant research will he encourage at the National 

Institutes of Health? Each of these agencies will come under his aegis as HHS 

secretary.

</P>

<P>  Above all, Thompson must be asked about his plans to help prevent the 

deaths of an estimated 400,000 Americans from tobacco products each year.

</P>

<P>  As the nation's chief health official, there can be fewer higher 

responsibilities.
