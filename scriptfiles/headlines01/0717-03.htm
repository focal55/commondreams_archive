WASHINGTON  - As up tens of thousands of

anti-globalization protesters converged on Genoa for a summit

of major industrialized nations, President Bush  on Tuesday

condemned them as ``no friends of the poor.''

<p>``I respect the right to peaceful expression, but make no

mistake -- those who protest free trade are no friends of the

poor. Those who protest free trade seek to deny them their best

hope for escaping poverty,'' Bush said in a speech at the World

Bank.

<p>Bush's remarks represented an escalation of administration

rhetoric against the protests and a reflection of concern over

the impact of disruptive, sometimes violent street protests

over trade and globalization that have accompanied many recent

gatherings of international leaders.

<p>``It really is becoming a modern fact of summitry and it's

becoming an unfortunate part of summitry that violence is

becoming a standard, not by the protesters but by others whose

cause is not peaceful protest but willful violence. And that

distorts the goals of the summit,'' White House spokesman Ari

Fleischer told reporters after the speech.

<p>Bush leaves on Wednesday for Europe, where he will

participate in the annual G8 summit of major industrial nations

plus Russia in the Italian port of Genoa, from Friday to

Sunday. A major theme of the summit will be global poverty

relief, and U.S. officials have denied that the theme is meant

as a response to the previous protests.

<p>Some 15,000 armed police are bracing for what protest

organizers say could be as many at 200,000 demonstrators in

Genoa.

<p>Bush was speaking on Tuesday at the World Bank to outline

U.S. anti-poverty initiatives for the summit including a

proposal to shift Wold Bank funding for development in the

poorest nations from lending to up to 50 percent grants.

<p>Bush also said he was hoping for broad agreement to launch

a new round of trade talks under the World Trade Organization,

a principal focus of the protests.

<p>Anti-globalization protesters contend a march toward

globalization of business and elimination of trade barriers

exploits workers in developing countries and harms the

environment.

<p>The protesters, Bush said, ``seek to shut down meetings

because they want to shut down trade.''

<p>``Legitimate concerns about labor standards, the

environment, (and) economic dislocation should be and will be

addressed. But we must reject a protectionism that blocks the

path of prosperity for developing countries. We must reject

policies that would condemn them to permanent poverty,'' he

said.
