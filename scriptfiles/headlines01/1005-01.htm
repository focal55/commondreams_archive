</font>STOCKHOLM  - An Israeli peace group that says only justice and reconciliation can end terrorism was named Thursday as a winner of this year's <a href="http://www.rightlivelihood.se/" target="_new">Right Livelihood Awards</a>, often referred to as the &quot;alternative Nobels.&quot;

<p>

<a href="http://www.gush-shalom.org/english/index.html" target="_new">Gush Shalom</a> and its cofounders Uri and Rachel Avnery, will share the &#36;297,000 (Canadian) prize with three others: British anti-nuclear group <a href="http://tridentploughshares.org/" target="_new">Trident Ploughshares</a>; Leonard Boff, a Brazilian founder of liberation theology in Latin America, and Venezuelan youth activist Jose Antonio Abreu.

<p>

The award's creator, Jakob von Uexkull, said each winner showed &quot;positive ways forward at this time of grief, fear and insecurity&quot; after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks in the United States.

<p>

&quot;We feel very strongly that the only remedy for terror is justice and reconciliation and the promotion of human rights,&quot; von Uexkull said at a news conference.

<p>

The Right Livelihood Awards were founded in 1980 by von Uexkull, a stamp dealer who sold his collection to fund awards for efforts he believes are ignored by the Nobel Prizes.

<p>

Gush Shalom was founded in 1993 by peace activists to campaign against the extension of Israeli settlements in the occupied territories and for the right of Palestinians to establish an independent state.

<p>

&quot;They are really the only strong voice left in the Israeli peace movement who are reminding the Israelis and the world, of course, that there will never be peace unless you actually tackle the root of the problem,&quot; von Uexkull said.

<p>

He said places like the occupied Gaza Strip, where about 6,000 Israeli settlers live among more than one million Palestinians, create new generations of terrorists like Osama bin Laden, the suspected mastermind of the Sept. 11 attacks in the United States.

<p>

Trident Ploughshares was cited for its nonviolent campaign to rid the world of nuclear weapons.

<p>

<p>

Abreu, founder of the National System of Children and Youth Orchestras, was named for demonstrating the innate creativity of all children.

<p>

The awards will be presented in the Swedish parliament Dec. 7, three days before the Nobel Prizes are handed out.
