Turkish Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit warned that Israel's retaliative strikes against Palestinians risked plunging the region into a war, far worse than in Afghanistan.

<p>Israeli Prime Minister Ariel "Sharon is determined to implement very excessive, unjust measures against the Palestinian Authority and soil," Ecevit told reporters Tuesday.</p>

</font>"If this turns into an actual war, it may lead to a situation that could be more dangerous than the one in Afghanistan, particularly for our region. That is why I am sad and concerned," he said.

<p>The United States is leading a military campaign in Afghanistan to topple the Taliban and hunt down leaders of the al-Qaeda network of Osama bin Laden, accused for the September 11 attacks on New York and Washington.</p>

<p>The foreign ministry separately called on Israel to put an end to its military operations and warned that further action could lead to an uncontrollable situation.</p>

<p>Ecevit, whose country is Israel's top regional ally, also criticized the United States, saying it needed to play a more direct role to prevent further bloodshed.</p>

<p>"Unfortunately, the countries supposed to take care of Israel and the Palestinians have not yet paid the attention that we pay, while the developments have entered (a process of) serious escalation," the prime minister said.</p>

<p>"I think that it is useful, and even necessary, for the United States to take more effective action," he added.</p>

<p>Ecevit said he spoke by phone with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat on Monday evening and Sharon earlier on Tuesday and urged both leaders to "come together as soon as possible within a framework of a constructive understanding."</p>

<p>He reiterated that Sharon's demands for absolute security before the resumption of peace talks were "unrealistic," because hardliners on both sides were hindering efforts for compromise.</p>

<p>Turkey, a mainly Muslim and strictly secular non-Arab country, has been Israel's chief regional ally since 1996 when the two sides hammered out a military cooperation accord, much to the anger of most Arab nations.</p>

<p>But Ankara has recently raised its voice against Sahron's hardline policies toward the Palestinians.</p>

<p>Turkey also maintains full-fledged diplomatic relations with the Palestinians and supports their demands for statehood.</p>

<p>Israeli F-16s and helicopters on Tuesday bombarded five Palestinian security positions in the Gaza Strip, killing two people and injuring more than 120 others, security and hospital sources told AFP.</p>

<p>In Gaza City, the air strikes also hit the headquarters of Arafat's elite Force 17 guards and his private heliport near his offices for the second time in 24 hours, they said.</p>
