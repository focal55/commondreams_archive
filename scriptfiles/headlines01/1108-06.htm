Tony Blair is urging President George Bush to throw the full weight of the United States behind a new push for peace in the Middle East.

<p>

At the White House last night, the Prime Minister warned that Arab and Muslim countries would not fully support the war on terrorism unless they were convinced America and its allies were committed to a long-term solution in the Middle East and Afghanistan.

</p>

<p>

Publicly too, Mr Blair said that the Middle East could not be neglected. Triumph over Osama bin Laden and his terrorist network was not conditional on progress in the Middle East. Success was certain and he accused Mr bin Laden of "hijacking" the Arab-Israeli conflict to further a  propaganda war against the West.

</p>

<p>

But Mr Blair stressed the need to "strain every sinew" to achieve the progress he believed possible towards a settlement. Mr Bush was far blunter: "Peace or no peace in the Middle East, we'll bring al-Qa'ida to justice."

</p>

<p>

Mr Blair is also understood to have appealed to President Bush not to widen the bombing campaign to Iraq. British ministers are worried there is pressure coming from hardliners in the White House to extend strikes to Iraq.

</p>

<p>

One senior minister said: "There are people in Washington who want to use this to finish off Saddam Hussein. We don't think it's a good idea."

</p>

<p>

Mr Blair told President Bush that, on his tour of the Middle East last week, he found Arabs were skeptical. The Prime Minister was stung by Arab criticism that Washington and London had only revived their interest in Arab-Israeli conflict because of the terrorist attacks in America. "The feeling of double standards came through forcibly," a British source admitted. Mr Blair wants America to make a commitment to a Palestinian state, something that would be seen as distancing itself from its traditional ally, Israel. In return, Israel would need security guarantees and for Palestinians to clamp down on extremists.

</p>

<p>

Two Palestinians were killed by Israeli troops yesterday as violence failed to subside despite Israel's continuing withdrawal from Palestinian  areas.

</p>

<p>

Downing Street denies there is tension between London and Washington and believes Mr Blair is pushing at an open door. One British official said: "It's a question of making sure all the engines are firing together."

</p>

<p>

Although Washington is likely to table proposals on the Middle East shortly, British officials are playing down the prospects of an immediate breakthrough. They say the first task is to halt the cycle of violence.

</p>

<p>

Mr Bush and Mr Blair were also believed to have discussed the timing and scale of ground operations in Afghanistan, as well as a proposal by France for a conference of the countries that have contributed humanitarian aid to Afghanistan.

</p>

<p>

The Prime Minister told the Commons yesterday: "I think the idea of a donor meeting is a sound idea. The difficulty is that, even if aid and food goes in, the Taliban are obstructing that aid reaching the people."

</p>

<p>

Mr Blair rejected a call by Charles Kennedy, the Liberal Democrat leader, for an end to cluster bombing. Mr Blair said: "If we want this conflict to be brought to an end quickly, we have to fight it vigorously."

</p>

<p>

Mr Blair's second visit to the US since the terrorist attacks was warmly applauded. Describing his behavior since 11 September as "exemplary," the conservative Washington Times said he was a "true friend" who had acted as the United States emissary on his recent diplomatic missions to Russia, Pakistan, Oman, Syria and Egypt.

</p>

<p>

Asked about the Prime Minister's impact on Mr Bush's thinking, the President's spokesman, Ari Fleischer, said  Mr Blair was "very influential".
