BUDAPEST, Hungary &#150;&#150;  NATO's top policy-making body stopped far short of endorsing the Bush administration's plan for a national missile defense Tuesday, preparing to offer only to "continue substantive consultations" with Washington.

</table></font>A draft statement to be issued later in the day by the North Atlantic Council does not portray the possibility of missile attack as a common threat faced by allies, as the Bush administration had hoped. The statement was obtained by The Associated Press.

<p>

Secretary of State Colin Powell had hoped to persuade skeptical NATO allies to be more supportive of U.S. missile defense plans.

<p>

But, according to sources close to the process who spoke on the condition of anonymity, France and Germany resisted stronger language sought by Powell.

<p>

The draft statement said NATO allies "welcome the consultations initiated by President Bush on the U.S. strategic review, including missile defense."

<p>

"We intend to pursue these consultations vigorously, and welcome the United States' assurance that the views of allies will be taken into account as it considers its plans further."

<p>

In a minor victory, Powell was able to persuade NATO foreign ministers to omit from the joint statement any mention of the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty.

<p>

Last year's joint statement called the treaty "the cornerstone of strategic stability."

<p>

The Bush administration wants to scrap or heavily modify the treaty, which prohibits development of national missile defense systems.

<p>

The statement was prepared for the North Atlantic Council, the alliance's top policy-making board, which is made up of foreign ministers of the 19 NATO nations.

<p>

In addition to presenting U.S. views on missile defense, Powell also sought to assure allies that the United States would not pull its peacekeeping forces out of the Balkans, despite comments by Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld suggesting the U.S. role in Bosnia was near an end.

<p>

U.S. officials had worked behind the scenes to win approval of proposed language for a joint statement that would cite a "common threat" of missile attack in a section referring to the U.S. missile defense plan.

<p>

That would be stronger than the phrase "potential threat" that was in a year-earlier statement.

<p>

But the United States failed to get the stronger language included.

<p>

Instead, according to the draft obtained by the AP, NATO allies promise to consider "appropriate assessment of threats and address the full range of strategic issues affecting our common security, and the means to address them."

<p>

In the statement, the allies pledge to "continue substantive consultations in the alliance on these issues."

<p>

German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer said it was important that no decisions be made on the missile defense issue until further consultations have occurred.

<p>

A U.S. missile defense plan "must add to our security and stability. It must not lead to another arms race," Fischer said.

<p>

At an opening session, NATO foreign ministers voiced concern about violence in Macedonia and indicated support for only modest cuts in the peacekeeping mission in Bosnia, said a NATO official who attended.

<p>

The official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said the alliance is ready to support only "trimming and minor adjustment" in the Bosnian force.

<p>

Other NATO sources have said they expect announcement of a cut of 10 percent to 15 percent in the peacekeeping force of 21,000, of which 3,300 are Americans.

<p>

"I'll try to reassure them that there isn't a big split in the administration" on whether to stay the course in the Balkans, Powell said in advance of the 19-nation NATO meetings in Budapest &#150; the first NATO meeting ever held in a city once part of the Soviet bloc.

<p>

Powell's comments followed suggestions in Washington by Rumsfeld that the United States was ready to pull out of Bosnia.

<p>

Powell said Rumsfeld's comments may have been misinterpreted. The United States and its allies went into the Balkans together "and we'll come out together," Powell said. And he indicated that could be years from now.

<p>

NATO Secretary-General Lord Robertson opened the two-day session Tuesday by pledging to work toward "a more balanced trans-Atlantic relationship."

<p>

"This means above all that the European allies must shoulder a greater share of the burden of maintaining the security and stability," Robertson said. Robertson said the U.S. missile defense plan, the situation in the Balkans and ways to curb the proliferation of weapons would receive "intensive dialogue."

<p>

Participants expressed concern over political instability and ethnic violence in Macedonia, and were drafting a statement denouncing use of violence by extremists and urging the government to use "proportionate force" in maintaining order.

<p>

On missile defense, U.S. officials had sought approval of proposed language for a joint statement that would cite a "common threat" of missile attack.

<p>

That would be stronger than the phrase "potential threat" that was in a year-earlier statement. U.S. officials also had hoped to drop an earlier NATO declaration that the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty was "the cornerstone of strategic stability."

<p>

The Bush administration wants to scrap or heavily modify the treaty, which prohibits development of national missile defense systems.

<p>

Powell will meet separately on Wednesday morning with Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov, Powell aides said.

<p>

The latest wrinkle is a proposed U.S. offer to, in effect, compensate Russia for agreeing to modify the ABM treaty and allow development of such a missile defense.
