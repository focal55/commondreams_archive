Residents of the island-town of Vieques are alarmed
and angered by the United States military's use of depleted uranium (DU)
ammunition in a firing range located next to a civilian area.

<p>Since 1941, Vieques has been used by the US Navy for target practice. During
the last two years, Puerto Rican peace activists have engaged in a massive
and
unprecedented civil disobedience campaign to get the Navy to close its
firing
range there.

</TABLE></font>Vieques residents have followed with great concern the controversy raging in
Europe over the use of DU in the 1999 NATO war against Yugoslavia. They
remember very well the US Navy's statements to the effect that most ships
and
aeroplanes that were used in that war were tested in Vieques.

<p>According to a study carried out by the Puerto Rico Health Department, the
cancer rate in Vieques is 26.9 percent above Puerto Rico's average. The
study,
which covered the years 1990-94, says nothing about the possible causes of
this
unusually high cancer rate. But the Navy's opponents are certain that
military
activities on the island, including target practice with DU munitions, are
to
blame.

<p>Doctor Rafael Rivera-Castaño, who lives in Vieques, believes that the PR
Health
Department cancer study's data are already somewhat dated, and that the
current
cancer rate in Vieques is even higher. ''I estimate that the cancer rate
here
is now 52 percent over the Puerto Rico average,'' he said in an interview.

<p>Members of the Committee for the Rescue and Development of Vieques (CRDV)
recently met with environmental justice activists from the United States and
heard their experiences with DU.

<p>''We listened in horror as scientists and community activists from the US
told
about this new type of weaponry that had been used extensively in the Gulf
War. We had recently heard retired Admiral Diego Hernández say that the
'success' of the US forces in Iraq was due in great measure to their
practising
in Vieques,'' said CRDV spokesman Ismael Guadalupe.

<p>''For years we have denounced the relationship between the military
contamination and the exaggerated levels of cancer on Vieques. The heavy
metals
and other chemical components from explosives, dangerous to human health,
combined with the radioactive uranium 238 projectiles, jeopardise the life
of
Viequenses today as well as future generations,'' said Nilda Medina, also of
the CRDV.

<p>''There is no way to guarantee that the next bomb or cannon shot will not
impact one of the uranium shells, putting into the air radioactive particles
that could be air transported to the civilian sector, to our children, to
our
old folks, to any one of us. We urge the authorities responsible for our
health
and security to block any future bombing that puts in danger the entire
Vieques
community,'' expressed Medina.

<p>The Navy admitted that it had used DU ammunition in Vieques in a May 10,
1999
statement in response to a Freedom of Information Act request by the
Military
Toxics Project, a US-based organisation. In the communiqué, signed by B.L.
Thompson, the Navy said that it fired DU rounds in Vieques once, in February
1999, and claims that it used only 263 airplane-fired, low-calibre rounds,
and
that it had been done by mistake.

<p>However, military scientist Doug Rokke, one of the world's leading
authorities
on DU, finds the last two claims unbelievable. ''If they fired 263 DU
rounds in
Vieques, then it's going to snow in San Juan tomorrow,'' he said.

<p>During a recent visit to Puerto Rico and Vieques island Rokke said 263
rounds
is ''not even a burst of automatic gunfire. The A-10 Warthog attack plane,
which fires DU ammunition, can fire three to four thousand rounds per
minute.''
He added that it couldn't have possibly been a mistake, since the Pentagon
keeps very strict inventory of all its ammunition.

<p>DU consists mostly of uranium 238 (U238), a by-product of uranium
enrichment,
the process through which uranium 235 (U235) is separated from the uranium
ore.
Both isotopes are radioactive, but unlike U235, U238 is useless for nuclear
bombs or nuclear power. It is simply radioactive waste and it will remain
radioactive for 4.5 billion years. The US Nuclear Regulatory Commission
estimated in 1991 that there must be one million pounds of this material in
the
United States.

<p>The US government has decided to dispose of this radioactive waste by
selling
it as ammunition. DU is an ideal material for bullets, since it is 70
percent
more dense than lead, and is extremely susceptible to friction. Violent
impacts
can make it reach temperatures in the thousands of degrees Fahrenheit in a
fraction of a second. For these reasons, a DU bullet can pierce a tank's
armour
like a knife through butter and scorch the crew inside.

<p>''These bullets are not coated or tipped with this material. They are pure,
solid DU,'' informed Rokke.

<p>When a DU round is fired, 60 percent of its mass ends up as microscopic
aerosol
particles in the air, which can be carried miles downwind, according to the
Military Toxics Project. Although it is less radioactive than weapons-grade
U235, the group claims that a single DU particle a thousandth of a
millimetre
in size lodged inside a human lung emits 800 times the amount of radiation
considered safe by federal standards.

<p>The use of DU ammunition constitutes ''a crime against God and humanity'',
declared Rokke, who directed the Pentagon's Depleted Uranium Project and
wrote
its Cleanup and Handling Protocol for Depleted Uranium.

<p>Based on his studies, he concluded that anyone who comes in contact with
these
munitions must get medical attention, not only those who have been fired at
with them, but also those who have fired them, as well as anyone who has
come
near structures impacted by these bullets.

<p>Rokke speaks from experience. He suffers from radiation poisoning since he
visited the Persian Gulf area to study the effects of DU ordnance used by US
forces in the 1991 war against Iraq. His urine contains 2000 times the
amount
of uranium considered normal.

<p>In his view, DU is largely responsible for the unusual health problems that
US
veterans of the 1991 Gulf War have been suffering, known collectively as the
'Gulf War Syndrome'. The military denies that there is any such causal
relationship.

<p>''Vieques must be the place to stop the criminal actions of the US armed
forces, which use the cloak of secrecy to claim that there's no danger in
using
depleted uranium ammunition and ignore veterans' calls for medical
attention,
and refuse to take on their responsibility to clean up and decontaminate,''
said Rokke.

<p>Rokke also senses a pattern of environmental racism in the Pentagon's
decision
to test DU in Vieques and in the Japanese island of Okinawa. ''The US
Defence
Department's policy is racist and discriminatory, contrary to the principle
of
environmental justice. We have the cases of Vieques and Okinawa, where DU
ammunition has been experimented with. These are not isolated events, or
errors
or chance. These are planned actions to test and later use this highly
polluting ammunition in Kosovo and the Persian Gulf.''

<p>The US Department of Defence claims that DU does not represent a significant
hazard to human health. Its spokespersons refer to an April 1999 RAND
Corporation study, which supports the military's position.

<p>But the RAND report is biased and incomplete, says 'DoD Analysis: The Good,
The
Bad and The Ugly', a report written by Dan Fahey, a former naval officer and
currently Director of Research at the Gulf War Resource Centre. Fahey's
report,
which was written for the US General Accounting Office, states that RAND
made
no reference at all to 62 relevant information sources.

<p>According to Fahey, RAND ignored studies which demonstrate a clear
relationship
between DU and harm to human health, for example those carried out by the
Armed
Forces Radiobiology Research Institute.

<p>US armed forces have already used these munitions extensively. During the
1991
Gulf War US troops fired an estimated 300 tons of it into civilian and
military
targets in Iraq.

<p>According to Physicians for Social Responsibility, in the 1999 NATO war
against
Yugoslavia, US tanks fired 14,000 high-calibre DU rounds, while planes fired
940,000 smaller calibre DU bullets. US armed forces are not the only ones to
use DU ammunition. Authorised arms dealers sell them to 16 countries,
including
Israel, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and Taiwan.
