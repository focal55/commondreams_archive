BOGOTA  - A new anti-drug battalion trained by U.S.

instructors began to function Thursday, completing the military

component of Plan Colombia, the multi-billion dollar programme

with which the government of Andrés Pastrana is fighting drug

traffickers and the irregular armies involved in the country's

civil war.

</table></font>The 698-troop battalion will operate out of the Larandia base

in the southeastern department of Caquetá, the epicentre of Plan

Colombia, which the United States is helping to finance with a 1.3

billion dollar contribution, 70 percent of which has been

earmarked for the fight against drugs. <P>

   The United States has provided 25 helicopters, which sprayed

and eradicated 30,000 hectares of coca crops from December to

March, 40 percent of them located in southeastern Colombia,

according to Defence Ministry figures. <P>

   The new battalion is part of the ''Southern Task Forces'', made

up of 10,000 army and navy troops and police agents posted at the

Tres Esquinas military base in Caquetá, said brigade commander

General Mario Montoya. <P>

   The aim of Plan Colombia is to totally wipe out drug

trafficking in this country, which has become the world's leading

supplier of cocaine, within five years. <P>

   The anti-narcotics battalion will concentrate its operations in

the departments of Putumayo and Caquetá, a region with a heavy

paramilitary and guerrilla presence, where 70 percent of the coca

used to produce cocaine is grown, said Montoya. It will then move

on to fight drug trafficking in other parts of this country of 40

million. <P>

   The battalion is equipped with state-of-the-art weaponry and

technology, and has received military training from Washington in

the framework of Plan Colombia, which was designed by U.S. and

Colombian policy-makers and put into effect last August. <P>

   There are currently 170 U.S. military trainers and 60 advisers

in Colombia, said Montoya. <P>

   The U.S. military presence and the uses given to most of

Washington's aid for Plan Colombia have stirred up a storm of

opposition at home and abroad. <P>

   An alliance of 60 non-governmental organisations (NGOs) from

Colombia, the United States and Europe, for instance, argues that

the mostly military aid will only lead to a further escalation of

the decades-old war, and could turn Colombia into a new Vietnam. <P>

   Independent Senator Rafael Orduz told IPS that the launch of

the new battalion completed ''the foundation of force of Plan

Colombia, a strategy designed by Washington and the Pastrana

administration that combines military strength and the eradication

of illicit crops.'' <P>

   But Orduz maintained that the U.S. presence could not be

considered an act of ''interventionism,'' because it was based on

a U.S. law that was accepted by the Pastrana government. <P>

   The legislator said the strategy, which consists of fighting

drug traffickers, right-wing paramilitaries and guerrillas - with

which the government is involved in peace talks - alike, is a

''fatal combination'' which will end up displacing the civilian

population from areas where coca crops are being sprayed. <P>

   The U.S. presence is part of ''a long-term, continent-wide

strategy of the Pentagon (U.S. Department of Defence), which is

seeking to gain control over the territory for its global free

trade policy,'' said Jorge Rojas, with the coalition of local

NGOs, Paz Colombia. <P>

   The U.S. State Department is pressing for congressional

approval of a ''Regional Andean Initiative'', secretly negotiated

with Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Venezuela,

according to press reports. <P>

   U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell argues that the Andean

initiative would enable Washington to focus on the drug trade in

Colombia, without losing sight of the fact that it is a ''regional

problem.'' <P>

   The government of George W. Bush plans to assign 731 million

dollars to the Andean region initiative in next year's budget.

Half of the funds would go to Colombia, and the rest to the other

five countries, which fear the spillover effects of Plan Colombia,

already felt by Ecuador and Venezuela.
