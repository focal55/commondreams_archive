Organizers said that several thousand people had taken part in the protest on 500 tractors.

<p>Tractors first surrounded a temporary waste storage facility in Gorleben and later headed for another demonstration in nearby Seerau.</p>

<p>On Saturday, more than 10,000 anti-nuclear activists had protested in Lueneburg against the resumption of nuclear waste shipments, and many spent the night in churches or at a campground. No incidents were reported.</p>

<p>On Monday, treated nuclear waste is scheduled to be shipped from a French recycling facility in La Hague to Gorleben, some 70 kilometers (45 miles) from Lueneburg.</p>

<p>It will be the first such shipment in four years.</p>

<p>The transport of nuclear waste from France to Germany was halted in 1998 after numerous protests, particularly from German environmental activists.</p>

<p>But French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin and German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder announced after meeting on January 31 that the shipments would resume.</p>
