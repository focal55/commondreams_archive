France criticized the United States of not going the "right way" over attempts to strengthen an international treaty that bans the development, stockpiling and use of biological weapons.

<p>"The US approach expressed by the US representative, John Bolton, is not our own", French foreign ministry Francois Rivasseau said a day after a meeting began in Geneva to review the effectiveness of the 1972 Biological Weapons Treaty (BWC).</p>

<p>"We do not share the US idea that disarmament should only concern supposedly virtuous states," he added.</p>

<p>At the conference in Geneva, the US accused North Korea, Iraq, Iran, Libya, Sudan and Syria of violating the convention, by wanting to impose their own interpretations of the convention rather than adhering to the clauses negotiated six years ago by the United Nations.</p>

<p>"The United States strongly suspects Iraq of having profited from an absence of UN inspectors for three years to step up a gear in all the stages of its program for offensive biological weapons", Bolton told the convention's 144 member states in Geneva.</p>

<p>But Rivasseau said that despite "gray areas" relating to Iraq's supply of biological weapons, this country "no longer represents a threat to its neighbors in terms of weapons of mass destruction".</p>

<p>He did not specify from where he had obtained this information.</p>

<p>Rivasseau added that facilities exist throughout the world to produce biological weapons, but they are not necessarily used for "hostile purposes".</p>

<p>"We strongly back unilateral disarmament and the control of arms which the safety of the international community depends on", Rivasseau said.</p>

<p>"To this end, the points of view put across by the US delegation Monday did not seem to us to be going in the right direction to face up to this challenge."</p>

<p>The United States on Monday formally presented a series of proposals first unveiled by US President George W. Bush three weeks ago, which Bolton said could strengthen the BWC immediately to meet new threats such as bio-terrorism.</p>

<p>Rivasseau stressed the commitment from France and its European partners to regularly follow through the measures laid down by the BWC, which 144 countries have ratified.</p>

<p>"For us, the provisions of the convention are insufficient without mechanisms in place which allow it to be respected", he said.</p>

<p>"It is for this reason that we regret the setback in negotiations protocol in terms of strengthening the effectiveness of the convention, following an American refusal to continue the discussions".</p>

<p>"We believe it is imperative that the member states look at new measures... of stopping the use of biological agents for hostile purposes", Rivasseau said.</p>
