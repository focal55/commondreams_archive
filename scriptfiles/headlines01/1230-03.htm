At least 60,000 Indians have fled their homes in the last five days amid heavy shelling and a massive buildup of troops on both sides of the Pakistan-India border in Kashmir, a state minister said.

<p>Kashmir Housing Minister Ghulam M Shah said the state administration was battling to provide food and shelter to the thousands who had evacuated their villages near India's shared border with Pakistan.</p>

</font>"We are faced with an alarming exodus of villagers from the tense India-Pakistan border," said Shah.

<p>"We have built hundreds of makeshift camps in 27 government schools and colleges. We have created an emergency 10-million-rupee (210,000 dollar) fund for housing and relief operations," he added.</p>

<p>Tensions between India and Pakistan have soared since a bloody December 13 assault on India's parliament, which New Delhi accuses Pakistan's military intelligence of masterminding. Islamabad denies the allegation.</p>

<p>The attack, and the rhetoric that followed, had prompted both sides to amass troops along their border and engage in cross-border shelling.</p>

<p>At least two civilians were injured when Pakistani troops fired shells across the tense Line of Control (LoC) which divides disputed Kashmir, Indian army Brigadier P.C Das told AFP Sunday.</p>

<p>"Pakistani troops have been shelling the border districts of Poonch and Rajouri in Jammu. There have also been bursts of machine-gun firing in the Samba, R.S Pura, Pallanwalla and Akhnoor sectors," said DAs</p>

<p>"There has been considerable damage to civilian houses and property," he added.</p>

<p>The two nuclear-capable rivals regularly exchange fire in the Kashmir region, but the incidents have become more frequent in recent days as tensions mount.</p>

<p>India has also started a massive mine-laying exercise near the Line of Control.</p>

<p>One Indian soldier was killed and five others injured Sunday in Jammu when landmines they were laying along the border with Pakistan accidentally exploded, an army official said.</p>

<p>Another 19 Indian soldiers were killed Friday near a border post at Gamnewala, around 70 kilometres (44 miles) from Jaisalmer town in the western desert state of Rajasthan in accidental landmine explosions.</p>
