BOSTON --    State transportation officials, looking for new revenue, are taking a cue 
from professional sports arenas and seeking corporate sponsors to purchase 
naming rights for subway stations here.
<P>  Sponsorship, which would allow businesses to plaster their names on and 
around stations in the nation's oldest and fourth largest subway system, could 
raise as much as $20 million in the next five years, state officials said.
</P>
<P>  Boston's mass-transit corporate sponsorship plan is the first of its kind, 
according to the American Public Transportation Association.
</P>
<P>  In the Bay Area, the BART Board of Directors voted Thursday to prohibit the 
sale of station names, shooting down a plan by one of the directors of San 
Francisco's Municipal Railway to look into slapping corporate monikers on 
Metro stations. BART owns the stations it shares with the Muni in downtown San 
Francisco.
</P>
<P>  The Massachusetts plan also has its opponents.
</P>
<P>  "This is a hucksterism that degrades history and community in favor of 
crass commercialism," Ralph Nader wrote recently to Massachusetts Gov. Paul 
Cellucci, a Republican who supports the plan. "Once you start selling off the 
names of history, where will it end? When you rename the Harvard Square . . . 
stop for McDonald's?"
</P>
<P>  Massachusetts Transportation Secretary Kevin Sullivan said the Boston 
transit system is not in trouble: Its annual budget totals about $1 billion, 
and the system has no debt.
</P>
<P>  More money is needed because the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority,
</P>
<P>which runs the subway system, became financially independent last year for 
the first time in its 104-year history. Federal support for public 
transportation has declined, and transit fares, raised to $1 last year along 
metropolitan Boston routes, remain among the lowest in the nation.
</P>
<P>  "This is to inoculate the (transportation authority) down the road against 
any larger increase that may be necessary in terms of rate restructuring," 
Sullivan said.
</P>
<P>  "The fact is that it does not help to go back to the riders to put onerous 
rates on them, which will turn them away from public transportation and get 
them back into the automobiles that Mr. Nader finds so distasteful," he said.
</P>
<P>  State officials will not accept sponsorships from alcohol or tobacco 
companies, Sullivan said. The state's transportation department continues to 
fight a lawsuit brought by a pro-marijuana group seeking subway advertising 
rights.
</P>
<P>  The transportation authority intends for names to go to established 
companies.
</P>
<P>  A subway station is not a sports stadium, however, and Massachusetts 
officials might be overly optimistic in their revenue projections for an 
arrangement that one marketer said has "virtually no value."
</P>
<P>  Promotional opportunities are limited, hyphenated names can decrease the 
value of naming rights by 70 percent and no one can guarantee corporate 
longevity or name stability, said Dean Bonham, chairman of the Denver-based 
Bonham Group Inc., a sports and entertainment marketing firm.
</P>
<P>  "Any company that writes a check for $20 million or even $5 million is 
writing a check either because they are philanthropically inclined or mentally 
challenged," Bonham said. "The public officials in Massachusetts shouldn't 
expect to see a line of corporate executives around the block with checkbooks 
in their hip pockets."
</P>
<P>  Commuters offered mixed opinions recently at South End/Back Bay station, 
its facade draped with advertising banners for Macintosh computers.
</P>
<P>  One woman said the terminal would feel like entering another "walk-in 
commercial" in a city that lost the Boston Garden and gained the Fleet Center.
</P>
<P>  "It's almost dehumanizing the history of Boston," said Rebecca-Starr Price, 
25.
</P>
<P>  Tom Magee, a longtime station vendor, suggested private sponsors could be 
good, especially for a terminal with no heat. "They might decide to put some 

money in this building," he said, his breath misting in the chilly air.
</P>
<P>  Some private institutions already have subway stop naming rights for free, 
including Harvard University, the New England Aquarium, the Museum of Fine 
Arts and Prudential Insurance, but they might have to pay in the future.
