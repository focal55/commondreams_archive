ATLANTA  - The health safety net of last resort in

the United States provided by hospital emergency rooms is

critically overburdened and in some places in a state of near

collapse, a conference heard on Wednesday.

<p>The Society for Academic Emergency Medicine heard a series

of presentations that painted a scary picture of the situation

in the nation's emergency health system.

<p>``In Arizona we have the perfect storm, a disaster situation

where a combination of things makes you take on water so fast

you can't fix it,'' said Todd Taylor, vice president for public

affairs at the Arizona College of Emergency Physicians.

<p>``Most Americans still have no idea how dangerous it has

become to be ill or injured and go to an emergency room. The

chance of surviving a heart attack now depends more on the time

of day, the day of the week and your type of insurance than any

other factor,'' he said.

<p>Taylor asked his audience of doctors and nurses to raise

their hands if they had direct experience of patients dying of

heart attacks while waiting for treatment in an emergency room.

About half the hands in the room went up.

<p>The emergency symposium was called in response to a report

last year by the Institute of Medicine . It concluded that the

health safety net was ``in a state of serious jeopardy.''

<p>Researchers say several factors have contributed to the

crisis, including the continuing rise in the numbers of

Americans without health insurance -- now more than 44 million.

The uninsured use hospital emergency rooms as their sole source

of treatment and typically receive no preventive care.

<p>Also cited were constant pressure from managed care

agencies to cut costs, rising immigrant populations, most of

whom lack insurance, hospital closings and a dire lack of

nursing staff.

<p>``Things could get even worse. The economy could take a dip,

and it is taking a dip. Guess who will take the hit,'' said John

Billings, director of the Center for Health and Public Service

Research at New York University.

<p>He presented figures showing that in New York, 50 percent

of children had no contact with any medical personnel in the

first 30 days of their lives. But 50 percent showed up in

emergency rooms during their first year.

<p>President Bush  promised to invest $5 billion in the health

safety net during last year's presidential campaign. But

Billings said Bush's proposed budget, with its tax cuts of more

than $1 trillion, contained no net increase in federal funding

for emergency health care.

<p>``The glass is almost empty,'' he said.

<p>In 1988, there were 81 million visits to U.S. emergency

rooms, according to the National Center for Health Statistics.

Ten years later, the number rose above 100 million while the

number of emergency departments fell from about 5,200 to just

over 4,000.

<p>Under federal law, emergency rooms are required to allow

all patients access to care 24 hours a day, regardless of

ability to pay. But waits have become so long that substantial

numbers give up and leave before they are seen.

<p><font size=+1><b>Patients Must Wait Hours</b></font>

<p>Karin Rhodes, an emergency physician at the University of

Chicago hospital, recounted how a patient died last week of

cardiac arrest after waiting for five hours with chest pains

without being examined.

<p>Rhodes said research in Chicago suggested that 15 percent

of those who went to an emergency room left without being seen

or treated.

<p>Ula Hwang, chief resident of emergency medicine at the

Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York, cited a study

showing that of those who left before seeing a doctor, 11

percent needed to be hospitalized in the subsequent week.

<p>Even more worrisome is the amount of time emergency rooms

declare themselves ``on diversion,'' meaning they will no longer

accept patients being brought in by ambulance.

<p>In Northern Virginia, according to Dr. J.B. Orenstein

writing in the Washington Post last month, the area's 13

emergency rooms placed themselves ``on diversion'' for more than

4,000 hours in January.

<p>``Almost half the time back in that icy January, if you

needed an ambulance to get to an ER you were SOL; severely out

of luck,'' he wrote.

<p>The situation in emergency rooms is driving away nurses

because working conditions are so stressful and unpleasant, the

conference heard. As a result, the average age of nurses is

rising and some emergency rooms do not have even minimum staff

much of the time.
