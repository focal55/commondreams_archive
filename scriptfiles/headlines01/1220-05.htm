<p>The Food and Drug Administration, trying to douse one of the hottest

trends in food retailing, is warning Hain Celestial Group Inc. and five

other natural-foods companies that they are misleading consumers with

labels touting products as free of genetic modification.



<p>The non-GMO label -- the initials stand for "genetically modified

organisms" -- is on hundreds of food products. Virtually unknown in North

America just three years ago, the label is materializing on everything

from pasta and breakfast cereal to baby food and jam.



<p>The label is popular because repeated surveys show that the majority of

U.S. consumers want to know about the presence of genetically modified

ingredients, apparently so that they can choose whether to avoid them.



<p>But the FDA letters, issued on Nov. 29, reflect the growing concern of

agency officials that some marketers might be trying to play to the

public's worries about an unfamiliar technology -- which that FDA has

declared is safe.



<p>"We want to stop misleading statements," said Christine Taylor, director

of the FDA office that supervises label claims.



<p>It's far from clear, however, exactly what a food company can legally say

about its efforts to avoid biotechnology. The agency is still wading

through 55,000 comments on the wording guidance it wants to issue to

companies.



<p>Among other things, the FDA wants to stop companies from claiming products

are free of genetically modified ingredients. Regulators fear consumers

equate such a claim with a healthier product, much as dieters seek out

fat-free products.



<p>The FDA also doubts that food companies can make a non-GMO claim with

absolute certainty. The Wall Street Journal, for a page-one article on

April 5, had a food laboratory analyze products that bore labels claiming

that none of the ingredients were genetically modified. Of the 20 products

tested, 16 contained evidence of genetic material used to modify plants.



<p>The FDA complained in its letter that some Hain products -- such as

Bearitos tortilla chips -- are labeled as "pure" with the claim that they

don't contain genetically engineered ingredients. Hain, Uniondale, N.Y.,

didn't return phone calls seeking comment on the FDA letter, which asks

the company to explain how it intends to comply with branding laws that

prohibit misleading labels.



<p>Some companies quickly backpedaled after receiving the FDA letter.



<p>Healthy Times Inc., a closely held maker of natural baby food, will

probably drop its non-GMO label. "We have a natural philosophy, so we

avoid GMOs," said Richard Prescott, who runs the small Poway, Calif.,

company with his wife. "But we aren't big enough to the fight the FDA," he

said.



<p>U.S. Mills Inc., Needham, Mass., said it will try to reword the label on

its Erewhon brand of breakfast cereal and move it to a less conspicuous

spot on the box. "We need the information [on the box] or people will

constantly call us," said Charles T. Verde, president of the company. "The

FDA is way out of line on this."



<p>The FDA letters also were sent to Spectrum Organic Products Inc. in

Petaluma, Calif.; B&G Foods Inc., Parsippany, N.J.; and Van's

International Foods, Torrance, Calif.
