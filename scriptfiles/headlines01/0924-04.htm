As many as one in seven people in western society may have been damaged by exposure by asbestos, say researchers.

<P>

Tests on a random sample of autopsy corpses found the tell-tale signs of asbestos in 13% of them.

<P>

Approximately the same proportion had a thickening of a lung membrane which suggests damage.

<P>

This is a worryingly high figure, and experts say that the number of fatal cancers in industrialized countries caused by exposure to the fireproofing material will continue to rise until 2020.

<P>

This rise is likely to be outpaced by deaths in the developing world, where asbestos is still in widespread use.

<P><B>Huge production</B>

<P>

Global asbestos production exceeded 2m tons last year, with the biggest producers being  Russia, China and Canada.

<P>

Asbestos causes disease when the fibers that make it up are carried in dust into the lungs of the patient.

<P>

Over time, this can cause inflammation, which, decades later, can lead to lung cancer, or a tumor called mesothelioma.

<P>

These are almost always fatal - the number of mesothelioma deaths has spiraled upwards in recent decades as disease seeded years earlier finally manifests itself.

<P>

Marc Letourneux, of the University Medical Center Cote de Nacre in Caen, France, told a symposium on asbestos-related disease: "There will be a steady rise in the frequency of asbestos-linked cancers until at least 2010 and 2020, almost twice the rate of 1996/7."

<P>

At the Erasmus Hospital in Brussels, 160 autopsies performed between 1998 and 2000 were reexamined, and "pleural plaques" - a thickening of a lung membrane suggestive of damage - were found in 14% of them, and 20% of the men.

<P>

Concentrations of more than 1,000 asbestos bodies per gram of dry lung tissue were found in 13%.

<P>

Experts were clear that the time lag between exposure and disease meant that thousands of cases would continue to emerge each year.

<P>

Antii Tossavainen, from the Finnish Institute of Occupational Health, told the meeting: "We know that occupational asbestos exposure in Western Europe, North America, Japan and Australia was at its peak in the 1970s.

<P>

"Now, recent estimates indicate that 30,000 new asbestos-related cancers continue to be diagnosed there every year.

<P>

"They include some 10,000 mesotheliomas, and approximately 20,000 cases of lung cancer."
