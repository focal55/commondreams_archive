            Worried that decades-old public health laws could prevent authorities 

            from battling a 21st century bioterror plague, the Bush administration 

            is urging states to grant health officials sweeping powers in such 

            an epidemic. 

            <P>The administration wants all 50 states to adopt a law allowing 

              public health authorities to take over hospitals, seize drug supplies, 

              quarantine people exposed to infectious pathogens, draft doctors 

              to treat them, force patients to be vaccinated, and order police 

              to restrain residents from leaving contaminated areas. 

            <P>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention rushed out the proposed 

              legislation, at the request of Health and Human Services Secretary 

              Tommy Thompson, within weeks after the Sept. 11 hijackings and the 

              ensuing anthrax attacks. 

            <P>In California, Assemblyman Keith Richman, D-Granada Hills, has 

              drafted a measure nearly identical to the CDC model and plans to 

              introduce it early next year. 

            <P>The restrictions on civil liberties that his bill would allow during 

              a bioterror attack are bound to raise controversy, Richman acknowledged. 

              But he said health officials must be allowed to resort to them if 

              the nation faces an outbreak of smallpox, one of the worst possible 

              biological weapons. 

            <P>"Upwards of a third of the people who contract smallpox could potentially 

              die," said Richman, a physician with a degree in public health. 

              "We should have a public health law in place that could minimize 

              that situation as much as possible." 

            <P>Critics of the CDC proposal, however, say it threatens to create 

              a public health "police state" that could spur people to panic and 

              flee, helping to spread deadly germs farther afield. 

            <P>"This law treats American citizens as if they are the enemy," said 

              George Annas, chairman of the Health Law Department at the Boston 

              University School of Public Health. 

            <P>CDC spokesman Tom Skinner said the agency commissioned the model 

              statute well before Sept. 11 because a patchwork of antiquated state 

              laws needed to be updated. It accelerated the process after the 

              attacks and anthrax mailings. 

            <P>Simulations of bioterror attacks have indicated that an outbreak 

              could result in confusion, interjurisdictional conflict and civil 

              disorder, Skinner said. 

            <P>One such simulation was the Dark Winter exercise conducted in June 

              at Andrews Air Force Base, in which a mock president and National 

              Security Council had to grapple with a fictional terrorist release 

              of smallpox in Oklahoma. Within two weeks, the simulated outbreak 

              had mushroomed to 16,000 "cases" in 25 states, hundreds of people 

              were dead and panic riots were breaking out. 

            <P>In that exercise, state leaders proved unprepared to invoke sweeping 

              public health controls. Conflicts erupted between federal authorities 

              favoring central command and state officials who felt they should 

              decide whether to impose quarantines, order vaccinations and shut 

              down transportation. </p>

            <b>INEFFECTIVE STATE LAWS</b> 

            <P>Lawrence Gostin, the Georgetown University law professor who helped 

              draft the CDC model, said many state public health laws not only 

              lack the powers that officials would need, but would actually make 

              it harder to carry out such crucial steps as making sure suspected 

              bioterror victims are reported to health authorities. 

            <P>At the same time, he said, many of the laws dating from the late 

              19th or early 20th centuries do not include up-to-date civil rights 

              safeguards. 

            <P>"This (model) law gives far more protection of civil liberties 

              than there is in existing law," he said. 

            <P>Civil rights protections, however, are exactly what opponents find 

              lacking. The kind of public health emergency that would trigger 

              extraordinary powers for health officers is defined so broadly that 

              it could include AIDS, HIV infection or a severe flu epidemic, said 

              Tanya Ehrmann, director of public policy at the activist group AIDS 

              Action in Washington, D.C. 

            <P>Annas said that under the legislation, people could be detained 

              without a court order and isolated in stadiums or clinics without 

              an adequate process to challenge the decision. The proposed law 

              would also shield health officers from liability, along with anyone 

              working at their direction, for deaths or health damage suffered 

              by quarantined bioterror victims, he said. 

            <P>Under the measure, "if you kill people or hurt them, that's tough," 

              said Annas, one of 10 New England health law scholars urging Thompson 

              to change the draft law. "The families can't sue, nobody can sue." 

            <P>Joanne Hustead, senior counsel at the Health Privacy Project at 

              Georgetown University, said the CDC proposal is an important effort 

              to strengthen public health laws. But she said the broad definition 

              of a health emergency would allow the collection and sharing of 

              protected private health information under circumstances that don't 

              involve bioterrorism. 

            <P>In California, such issues could be worked out as Richman's bill 

              is considered in the Legislature, said Bruce Pomer, executive director 

              of the Health Officers Association of California. 

            <P>Existing California laws authorize health officers to take measures 

              such as quarantining tuberculosis patients who fail to take medication, 

              or requiring certain vaccinations for schoolchildren. But Pomer 

              said the state may need to reconsider civil rights safeguards that 

              could hamper health officials in a bioterror attack. </p>

            <b>PRIVACY CONCERNS</b> 

            <P>Placer County public health Director Richard Burton, president 

              of the Health Officers Association, said AIDS and HIV-positive patients 

              have won safeguards against having their identities revealed to 

              health authorities, and that such protections should be spelled 

              out for them in Richman's legislation. 

            <P>Kevin Reilly, deputy director for prevention services at the state 

              Department of Health Services, said the agency is reviewing the 

              model law and has not yet taken a position on it. Gostin and his 

              co-authors are reviewing comments on the draft law and will release 

              a modified version by Dec. 12. 

            <P>Mohammad Akhter, executive director of the American Public Health 

              Association, said the organization will consider its position on 

              the CDC model law at a Dec. 17 meeting. But he said that in general, 

              public health officials need more resources rather than more legislation. 

            <P>"If you don't have the early warning system, the training of doctors, 

              nurses and paramedics, and the capability of hospitals to take care 

              of patients exposed, no amount of legislation is going to protect 

              our people," Akhter said. "You have to focus on the right things."
