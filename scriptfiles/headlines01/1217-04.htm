A star circus performer will rivet outraged animal lovers today when 

he goes on trial in San Jose for allegedly gouging an elephant with a hooked 

stick.

<P>While critics have long protested that circus animals endure miserable 

confinement and painful handling and training, the trial of Mark Oliver Gebel, 

an elephant handler at the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus, is a 

rare criminal prosecution.

<P>Animal rights advocates hope the prosecution will put some practices of 

"The Greatest Show on Earth" on trial.

<P>The case comes just months after the Santa Clara County district attorney's 

office gained international attention by slapping a three-year prison sentence 

on a motorist for killing a tiny dog named Leo in a fit of road rage. Like 

that incident, a prosecutor said, the case involving Asia the elephant is 

drawing an outpouring of e-mail calling for the defendant's hide.

<P>"This is going to be a very interesting trial, mainly because it is 

Ringling, which bills itself as the top-of-the-line circus, with the best 

record, best resources, best treatment of animals," Richard Farinato, director 

of captive wildlife protection at the <a href="http://www.hsus.org/" target="_new">Humane Society of the United State</a>s, 

told the Associated Press. "This is pretty high-profile in the battle over 

whether circuses should use wild animals."

<P>Gebel, son of legendary animal trainer Gunther Gebel-Williams, is accused 

of using an ankus -- a stick with a metal hook -- to strike the female Asian 

elephant when she hesitated before entering the ring at Compaq Center in San 

Jose on Aug. 25, said Prosecutor Carolyn Powell. A San Jose police sergeant 

and two Humane Society officers routinely monitoring the circus reported 

seeing the elephant suddenly rush forward. The said they later found two 

nickel-sized puncture wounds behind her left leg.

<P>If convicted of misdemeanor elephant abuse, Gebel, 31, could face six 

months in jail and a $1,000 fine.

<P>Defense attorney James McManis of San Jose said animal activists are 

unfairly smearing Gebel to advance their crusade against performing animals.

<P>"He didn't do it," McManis said yesterday. "I think they've been after the 

circus for years. He's the unfortunate victim of their quest."

<P>McManis maintained that the Humane Society officer merely found a "red spot 

of something on the side of the animal and decided the animal had been jabbed 

in some manner. There's no evidence of injury -- no breaking of the skin, no 

scarring. The circus veterinarian was called to examine the animal and 

couldn't find evidence of injury."

<P>But a Humane Society statement said that in recent years, several former 

Ringling Bros. elephant workers have made sworn statements, accusing the 

circus of routinely using the ankus and beating animals to force them to 

perform.

<P>In 1998, the U.S. Department of Agriculture accused Ringling of forcing an 

ill elephant named Kenny to perform before he could be examined by a 

veterinarian, according to the Associated Press. Kenny died, and Ringling's 

parent company, Feld Entertainment Inc., settled the complaint by agreeing to 

pay $20,000 to elephant-related causes.
