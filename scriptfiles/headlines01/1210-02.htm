ISLAMABAD - Afghan women staged a protest in

Pakistan on Monday, denouncing past abuses by factions making

up their country's new government and predicting that the lot

of women would be no better than under the hard-line Taliban.

<p>``The Northern Alliance were criminals to our mothers and

young daughters,'' the women shouted at a small demonstration in

the Pakistani capital. Children accompanying them waved banners

and pictures of Northern Alliance fighters killing Taliban.

</font>Under a landmark deal reached in Germany last week, the

militarily dominant Northern Alliance will share power with

exile groups in a six-month interim administration.

<p>The Taliban, ousted by U.S.-backed tribal rivals, forced

women to wear the all-enveloping burqa and banned them from

working, studying or leaving home without a male relative -- a

harsh restriction in a land with many widowed in two decades of

war.

<p>But the leftist <a href="http://rawa.fancymarketing.net/" target="_new">Revolutionary Association of the Women of

Afghanistan (RAWA)</a> said in a statement that factions within the

victorious Northern Alliance were guilty of widespread rape of

women and girls when in power in the early 1990s

<p>``We don't believe that they will not repeat the crimes they

committed from 1992 to 1996,'' Alia Nazeer, a RAWA spokeswoman,

told Reuters.

<p>Most of the demonstrators wore veils, but none wore the

burqa.

<p>The RAWA statement said the end of the burqa was ``in no way

an indication of women's rights and liberties'' in Afghanistan.

<p>``The world community must consider the fanatic nature of

the Northern Alliance and Taliban. Northern Alliance and

Taliban are the same,'' Alia Nazeer said

<p>``The people of the world need to know that in terms of

widespread raping of girls and women from seven to 70, the

track record of the Taliban can no way stand up against that of

these very same Northern Alliance associates,'' the RAWA

statement said.

<p>As the Northern Alliance has chased the Taliban from power,

helped by weeks of U.S. bombing, a few women in Afghanistan

have stopped wearing their burqas and returned to work. Many

are taking a wait-and-see attitude.
