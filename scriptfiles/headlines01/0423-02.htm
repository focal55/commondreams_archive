QUEBEC CITY  - The Summit of the Americas ended here

Sunday

with a

declaration by leaders of 34 countries of the western hemisphere

to promote

democracy and with an endorsement of a plan to have a free trade

area up and

running by December 2005. 

<P>

However the Apr. 20-22 meeting was overshadowed by street clashes

between

police and a small section of an estimated 30,000 people

demonstrating against

the proposed Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA). <P>

Demonstrators charge that the FTAA seeks to grant excessive powers

to

multinational corporations, is not environmentally unfriendly and

will not

benefit the majority of the region's poor. <P>

But inside the conference chamber governments were more concerned

about the

issue of democracy, so much so that the final document of the

meeting, the

'Declaration of Quebec', contains a democracy clause that allows

state

parties

to the FTAA to throw out any member who breaches that provision. <P>

The 34 leaders agreed to convene a meeting of experts soon to

examine, in each

country, political party registration, access of political parties

to funding

and the media, campaign financing and the manner in which

elections are

conducted. <P>

''The benefits of free trade will accrue only to those who abide

by our

democratic clause,'' Canadian prime minister Jean Chretien told

the summit. <P>

Once created, the FTAA will be the world's biggest free trade area

spanning

the

hemisphere from Canada to Chile and encompassing nearly 800

million people. <P>

With that in mind, leaders endorsed the declaration of the Sixth

Ministerial of

the FTAA held earlier this month in Buenos Aires, Argentina. In

Buenos Aires

government ministers adopted a timetable that will see

negotiations completed

and signed by January 2005. The agreement is to be ratified and

implemented by

December 2005. <P>

April 2002 has been set as the date for the beginning of official

negotiations

on agriculture, merchandise trade, services and government

procurement.

Proposals on the environment and labour will only be dealt with at

the

start of

negotiations. <P>

Many Latin American countries have opposed US proposals to adopt a

principle

established in the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA)

that prohibits

the lowering of labour and environmental standards to attract

investment. <P>

Brazilian president Fernando Henrique Cardoso made it clear that

his country

will not go along with the FTAA if the United States is not

willing to lower

agricultural subsidies and make changes to anti-dumping laws that

make it

difficult for regional economies to enter the US market. <P>

Responding to the concerns of smaller countries, the conference

endorsed

recommendations that a committee be charged with formulating ways

to deal with

the different levels of development in the region by no later than

November

2001. Economies vary in size from 350 million dollars to 9

trillion dollars. <P>

Caribbean countries say they want a mechanism that provides

development

financing to ensure their countries can compete when the free

trade area

becomes operational. <P>

Responding to such concerns, Canada announced it would set up an

institute for

connectivity in the Americas to bridge the digital divide. It

pledged 20

million dollars this year towards the centre, with additional

financing

expected to come from regional development banks. <P>

Meanwhile outside the conference hall, the Canadian police used

teargas, water

cannons and rubber bullets to stop demonstrators intent on

creating havoc on

the streets. By Sunday more than 400 protestors had been arrested. <P>

''Unfortunately the media tended to concentrate on the bricks

being thrown

by a

few,'' says Robin Rosenberg of the North-South Centre at the

University of

Miami. He says some sections of civil society made a number of

recommendations

through a civil society roundtable, which officials agreed

to take up. <P>

But some organisers of a People's Summit which ended the day the

regional

leaders began their parley, charged that that the consultation

process was not

genuine and was meant only to buy public support. That summit,

which saw civil

society meeting to discuss the issue of a hemispheric free trade

deal,

rejected

the FTAA, noting that it was yet another accord which would raise

the fortunes

of transnational corporations and do nothing for the ordinary or

poor citizens

of the Americas. <P>

Hosting a People's Summit was a last minute decision by the

Canadian

government

in the face of increasing agitation from civil society groups, but

only a

select few were invited to participate. There were no non-

governmental groups

from Andean countries or from the Caribbean. <P>

''People from the People's Summit chose not to attend the NGO

forum perhaps

because they get more attention that way,'' said Rosenberg

reflecting

divisions

between the various strata of civil society. <P>

The Quebec declaration pledges that FTAA negotiators will increase

communication with civil society, ''to ensure that it has a clear

perception of

the development of the FTAA negotiating process''. <P>

''We are determined to inform our countries of the contents of our

discussions.

We need to explain what we are attempting to achieve,'' said

Argentine

president Fernando de la Rua whose country hosts the next Summit

of the

Americas on a date yet to be announced. <P>

''The next summit we will hold in Argentina will not require walls

for those

coming to oppose, but it will have space for those coming to

applaud,'' our 

actions.
