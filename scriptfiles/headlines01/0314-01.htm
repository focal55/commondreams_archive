An official from Japan's Environment Ministry was quoted as saying that the decision, if confirmed, was regrettable and could undermine the 1997 Kyoto protocol aimed at reducing greenhouse gases.
</font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Mr Bush said in a letter to Republican Senator Chuck Hagel that the decision was prompted by fears of aggravating the energy crisis faced in particular by the far West of the United States. 
</font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
Mr Bush originally pledged the reduction during last year's presidential election campaign.

</font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">He described as a "red herring" the Clean Air Act's failure to mention carbon dioxide, saying that powerful industrial lobbies had prevented any new consideration of global warming within it.
</font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
The main body of scientific opinion now recognised the gas as a major contributor to global warming, he added.

Mr Bush's letter was released on the same day that the Department of Energy announced its participation in a new institute in the state of Washington to study global warming.</font>
