<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>BBC Reporter FERGAL KEANE:</b>  On a Autumn  morning in 1982 an Israeli soldier

walked into a refugee camp and was confronted with a scene of desolation.  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>EMMANUEL ROSEN<br>

</b></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Journalist for Israeli

Defence Force, 1982</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It was very quiet, no one

screamed, no one yelled inside the camp. 

I remember the smell.  I remember

the picture that people were lying one on another and some of them were already

dead, some of them were still breathing.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">KEANE:  At least 800 civilians were massacred after

Israel's Minister of Defence, Ariel Sharon, allowed Lebanese Phalangist militiamen

into the camps of Sabra and Shatila.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Ariel Sharon speaking in

1985</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Not one of us, no one of our

soldiers, no one of our commanders, not myself, no one of our political leaders

in Israel was involved in that tragic event.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">KEANE:  When Ariel Sharon says, and other senior

Israeli officers, that they couldn't possibly have predicted what might have

happened...</font></p>

</b></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>US Special Envoy to the

Middle East, 1982</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Complete and utter nonsense.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">KEANE:  Nobody has ever been prosecuted for the

killings or for failing in their responsibilities to the murdered

civilians.  This is the story of those

who stand accused.  In June 1982

Israel's army stormed across an international border and invaded Lebanon.  The Israelis said they wanted to protect

their borders from Palestinian guerrilla attack and Ariel Sharon's army was

soon laying siege to the capital Beirut with its Palestinian camps.  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>MOUNAIR AHMED</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It was very scary because

you always hear the close bombs by and you always hear someone just died or someone

just got injured.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">KEANE:  An estimated 300 people were killed in a

single day's bombing. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Dr RANAAN GISSEN<br>

</b></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Israeli Prime Minister's

spokesman</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The threat emanating from

Lebanon as far as the terrorism that was launched by the PLO was such that if we

didn't go to that war, the whole northern part of Israel would have been

depopulated.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">KEANE:  After two months of war the PLO gave in to

the Israeli demand that  they leave

Lebanon.  For the civilians in Sabra and

Shatila it meant peace.  Children swam in

the craters left by bombs.  Tens of

thousands of people were crammed into the ghettos of Sabra and Shatila.  For families like the Ahmeds peace gave them

a chance to start work on reconstruction.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>NABIL AHMED</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Many of the homes that we

lived in had no doors, no windows.  The

ceiling half messed up is shaky.  No

water, no electricity.  It was very,

very difficult.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">KEANE:  An estimated 14,000 PLO and Syrian fighters

were evacuated from Beirut.  With the

fighters forced out, many left behind in the camps felt afraid.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>SUAD SURUR</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It was natural to feel

afraid after the Palestinian resistance had left, there was an inevitable

feeling of fear as if we sensed that something even more terrible was going to

happen, even though we had no idea what it was going to be.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">KEANE:  The people left behind in the camps had one

enemy to fear above all others.  They

were a Lebanese Christian militia who had been at war with the PLO for seven

years - the Phalange. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">NABIL AHMED:  The impression of Phalange was like they're

basically killers.  The minute they

would get hold of a Palestinian they would kill.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">KEANE:  The Phalange were led by the charismatic and

ruthless Bashir Gemayel.  He was

Israel's main ally in Lebanon.  Israel's

Mossad knew from meetings with him that he wanted to <i>'eliminate'  </i>the Palestinian problem, and now he was

about to become President of Lebanon. 

Bashir's election worried the people of the camps but they'd been

promised security.  It was a deal

brokered by America with the Israeli's and the beleaguered Lebanese

government.  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>MORRIS DRAPER<br>

</b></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>US Special Envoy to the

Middle East, 1982</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">America said that the women

and children and others left behind would be able to live in peace, as long as

they obeyed the law and Lebanese jurisdiction. 

It was as simple as that - a very simple document.  I wrote it.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">KEANE:  They needed that document because in

Lebanon's civil war civilians were routinely murdered as witnessed by a British

photographer several years earlier.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>DON McCULLIN</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I remember listening to an

old lady protesting to a Phalange and I looked at him and I looked at her and I

thought well what's it mean to him, this old lady, why is he bothering?  Why doesn't he just let her go?  And what he did, he saved himself the

trouble and he emptied a magazine into this old lady's chest and abdomen and

she just dropped down sighing.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">KEANE:  On all sides Lebanon's civil war embraced a

culture of murder.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">McCULLIN:  People who committed the acts of murder that

I saw that day were wearing crucifixions and were calling themselves

Christians.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">KEANE:  But the people in Sabra and Shatila had been

promised they'd be protected from their enemies, and then everything

exploded.  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>15<sup>th</sup> Sept 1982</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The fragile peace in Lebanon

is threatened by renewed tension following the disclosure overnight that the

President Elect, Mr Bashir Gemayel, died in yesterday's bomb attack on the

headquarters of his.....</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">KEANE:  The Phalangists were distraught and enraged

by the assassination.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">NEWS:   The Phalangist militia that Mr Gemayel once

headed and the Israeli forces are said to be on high alert.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">KEANE:  A Syrian agent would confess to the killing

but many in the camps feared the Palestinians would be blamed.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">NABIL AHMED:  People were scared, people get worried, and

I remember my mother's words that day in Arabic she said &quot;God protect us

from what's coming&quot;.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">KEANE:  Israeli forces were now close by the

camps.  There was crossfire.  Nabil's mother urged him, as a fit 16 year

old, to try and escape.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">NABIL AHMED:  When my mother agreed with my uncle to let

me go and run away, everybody in that shelter... I went down to the shelter,

everybody, including my younger brothers and sisters, started crying and

screaming.  They wanted to go with me.  Those moments were the most painful.  I'll never forget those moments.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><i>Wednesday</i> / 15<sup>TH</sup>

SEPTEMBER</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">KEANE:  Ariel Sharon now decided to send his army

into West Beirut, breaking a promise to the Americans that they would stay out

of that part of the city.  Israeli

military intelligence claimed there were 2000 PLO and other Muslim fighters in

West Beirut.  But in the event, the

battle was small.</font></p>

</b></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Commander, Paratroop

Brigade, 1982</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There was not fighting.  I have seen enough fighting in my life to

tell you this was not similar.  It was

relatively very easy, very secure.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">KEANE:  For the Phalange, convulsed by grief and

anger, it was a moment of crisis.  The

director of operations toured the front line.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>FOUAD ABOU NADER<br>

</b></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Phalange Head of Operations,

1982</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I decided to go and visit every

one on the front, every soldier, every barrack, just to boost the morale and to

tell them that even if Bashir is dead, we can go on, you know.. we have the

legacy, we have friends, we are still very strong you know.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">KEANE:  Ariel Sharon arrived in Beirut on Wednesday

morning insisting there were PLO forces in the camps.  He'd later testify he didn't want his troops fighting and dying

in Sabra and Shatila.  And so after conferring

with his senior officers, including Amos Yuron, the Commander for Beirut and

the refugee camps, Ariel Sharon agreed a fateful order.  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Only one element, and

that is the Israeli Defence Force, shall command the forces in the area.  For the operation in the camps the

Phalangist should be sent in.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">KEANE:  Ariel Sharon went to see the Phalange at

their headquarters to discuss the Beirut operation.  Among the commanders was a close friend of the murdered Bashir

Gemayel, a man called Elie Hobeika.  His

name will appear many times in this story. 

Now, a day after their leader's murder, the Israelis were asking the

Phalange to fight in Palestinian camps.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Could Ariel Sharon have been

in any doubt about what would have happened if you sent the Phalangists into a

Palestinian refugee camp, an undefended camp?</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Well you'd have to be

appallingly ignorant.  I mean I suppose

if you came down from the moon that day you might not predict it.</font></p>

</b></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Israeli Prime Minister's

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">All the evidence shows, and

that was clearly also in the Kahan Commission report, that first of all we did

not know.  None of our officers ever

could conceive of that.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">KEANE:  But you should have expected it surely.  These people had been killing since 1975

between them. They'd suffered massacres at the hands of the Palestinians.  What else did you think they were going to

do?</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">GISSEN:  But under the guidance and control of our

forces, we never expected that that would happen.  We never thought that these kind of forces which trained with us,

which were supposed to take part in the fighting, would actually go into that

area.  And under the guidance of their

leader, you know.. conduct a massacre.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><i>Thursday / </i> 16<sup>TH </sup>SEPTEMBER</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As Thursday, September 16<sup>th</sup>

dawned the Israelis had moved into Beirut in force.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>NABIL AHMED</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We saw tanks.. we saw

Israeli tanks, we saw soldiers.  We did

not come close to them, just from a distance because we would be arrested,

taken away.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>FERGAL KEANE</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For the first time in

history the Israelis had occupied an Arab capital.  By Thursday morning Israel's chief of staff was able to tell

Ariel Sharon the whole city is in our hands. 

There is complete quiet now.  The

camps are closed.  Now that's a crucial

moment because at that point Ariel Sharon and his army became legally responsible

for the safety of the civilians in Beirut, and that included the people of

Sabra and Shatila.  Under the long

established humanitarian laws which govern the behaviour of an occupying army

in an international armed conflict, political and military commanders are

responsible for protecting civilians from harm.  Judge Richard Goldstone is the man who led the prosecution of

suspected war criminals in the UN tribunals for the former Yugoslavia and

Rwanda.  Judge Goldstone is one of the

leading figures helping to develop war crimes law.  He's well acquainted with the concept of what is called 'command

responsibility'.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Judge RICHARD GOLDSTONE<br>

</b></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Former Chief Prosecutor<br>

</b></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>UN War Crime Tribunals,

1994-96</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A military commander and a

political leader who was involved in giving instructions would clearly have an

obligation under the law of war, and under the Geneva Convention, to ensure

that innocent civilians were not murdered or raped or injured in any way.  Command responsibility goes fairly far, it

requires obviously knowledge of the danger to innocent civilians if there's

that knowledge then there's an obligation to take reasonable steps to protect

them.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">KEANE:  In Tel Aviv Ariel Sharon and his Chief of

Staff met with American diplomats at the Defence Ministry.  The Americans wanted to know why the

Israelis had broken their promise and gone into West Beirut.   The Chief of Staff said it was to prevent a

Phalangist frenzy of revenge.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DRAPER:  The whole group of maybe twenty of us

altogether fell silent.  It was a dramatic

moment.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">KEANE:  But the Israelis also mentioned the

possibility of deploying the Phalange in West Beirut.  Morris Draper says the Americans were horrified at the

suggestion.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DRAPER:  We made it very clear, under no

circumstances could the United States tolerate this.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">KEANE:  Why?</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DRAPER:  Because it would be a massacre, we

knew.  Couldn't let those people in.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Reconstruction</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">KEANE:  But at around 7 o'clock the Phalange - about

150 of them - <u>were</u> let in to Sabra and Shatila.  It was a small force.  The Phalange knew there was no big PLO army

waiting for them.  In groups they went

to people's homes.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>SUAD SURUR</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There were thirteen of

them.  They knocked on the door.  My father said &quot;Who is it?&quot;  My younger brothers were sleeping.  The men replied they were Israelis.  I whispered to my father that they weren't

Israelis.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Summer 1982</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">KEANE:  The Phalange asked the Israelis to fire

flares into the sky to light their way. 

The Israelis agreed to their ally's request.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>NABIL AHMED</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The sky was completely lighted

all night long and after certain time and at night we could hear noise heavy

coming from the camp.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">KEANE:  Groups of civilians were herded into the

streets, 12 year old Mounair among them.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>MOUNAIR AHMED</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">They said the men and the

older guys to go to the right and the women and children go to the left.  They kept on telling us &quot;Don't worry,

you're going to be okay, you're going to be okay, nothing going to

happen&quot;.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">KEANE:  The Israelis had a forward command post

about 200 metres away which overlooked the camps.  There were Phalangists stationed on the roof with the

Israelis.  It was around this time, 7

o'clock on Thursday evening that an Israeli officer stationed on the roof

overheard a deeply troubling conversation. 

He was standing close to Elie Hobeika, the Leader of the Phalange

operation.   A soldier inside the camps

came on the radio.  He told Hobeika he

was holding 50 women and children.  What

should he do with them?  Hobeika replied

&quot;That's the last time you're going to ask me a question like that.  You know exactly what to do&quot;.  There was raucous laughter from the other

Phalangists.  The Israeli officer

reported this to his superior, General Amos Yuron.  There would be more worrying reports to the Yuron, but beyond

warning Elie Hobeika not to harm civilians the General took no further action

that night.  Ariel Sharon was now at a

cabinet meeting in Jerusalem.  Ministers

heard the Phalange were now in the camps. 

Deputy Prime Minister David Levy was deeply troubled.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;When I hear that the

Phalangists are already entering a certain neighbourhood and I know what the

meaning of revenge is for them, what kind of slaughter, then no one will

believe we went in to create order there and we will bear the blame.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Reconstruction</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">KEANE:  But the operation was not stopped.  The Phalange were now attacking people in

their homes.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SUAD SURUR:  Nobody dared look at anyone else.  Even the little ones wouldn't look at the

older ones, except for my little sister. 

While she was looking at us, a bullet shot her in the head.  She fell from my mother's arms like a

slaughtered bird.  My brother Shardie

was looking around and calling out &quot;Father&quot; calling for his father

when he was shot in the head.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">KEANE:  Suad fell wounded among the bodies of her

family.  On the streets groups of

terrified civilians were being shot at point blank range. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">MOUNAIR AHMED:  I was next to my mother.  She was hit first and a lot of people were

crying loud and little kids screaming, and I remember my sister was still alive

and they told her give us the ring and this.. 

which she did, and they shot her. 

There were also other things happening was the woman telling them like

they would tell each other tell her take her clothes off and that, and that,

and they were hurting them other ways before they killed them.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">KEANE:  An American nurse working in a camp hospital

saw civilians fleeing.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I became aware that people

were being killed in the camp when people started screaming and then running to

the hospital in large numbers and the people were screaming

&quot;Phalange&quot; and they had their fingers and they were making a gesture

across their throat like somebody was slitting throats.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SUAD:  The men returned for a third time.  They spoke to me nicely.  &quot;You're still alive&quot; they

said.  I shook my head and smiled at

them mockingly.  They said &quot;We're

going to finish you off right now.&quot; 

I said &quot;As you wish, do as you please.&quot;  They shot me in the arm and they hit my head

with the butt of a rifle.  One of them

shot me, the other one hit me.  I lost

consciousness.  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">KEANE:  Sixteen year old Suad was also raped.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Well, you know I had the

same feelings I had unfortunately too frequently in my life and in my own

country in South Africa seeing women and children in those sort of extreme

situations.  I came across those sorts

of images obviously coming out of the ethnic cleansing in Bosnia.  More recently in Kosovo where there was

similar ethnic cleansing, and needless to say, in the horror of the terrible

genocide in Rwanda.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">KEANE:  That Friday morning, concerned about reports

of killing, the Israelis surrounding the camps ordered the Phalange operation

halted.  But the Israelis allowed the

Phalange to stay in the camps, and the killing continued.  An Israeli officer encountered a group of

fleeing civilians on Friday afternoon in West Beirut.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I saw suddenly about 20 or

30 Palestinian trying to cross this road and they are very hysterical and we

didn't allow them to pass.  There was a

young Israeli officer he got his order not to let any Palestinian to cross into

the northern part of Beirut, and they were hysterical.  I asked &quot;What happened, what

happened?&quot;   They say &quot;They

kill us.&quot;   I say &quot;Okay, go,

pass.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">KEANE:  The colonel reported this over the radio to

his superior, General Yuron.  Earlier

General Yuron and the Chief of Staff met the Phalange leadership. Though the

Israeli command in Beirut were now aware of serious questions about the abuse

of civilians they didn't raise the issue with the Phalange.  In fact it was agreed the Phalange could

remain in the camps for another 12 hours, and the Israelis agreed to provide a

bulldozer for the demolition of illegal houses.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">KEANE:  Back in Israel between 8 and 9 Ariel Sharon

was told the Phalangists had harmed the civilian population more than was

expected.  They had gone too far.  The operation had been stopped his Chief of

Staff told him and the Phalange would be out of the camps by 5am.  Then, at around half past eleven he received

another phone call.</font></p>

sleeping.  He woke up and I told him

&quot;Listen, there are stories about killings and massacres in the camps.  A lot of our officers know about it and tell

me about it, and if they know it, the whole world will know about it.  You can still stop it.&quot;  I didn't know that the massacre actually

started 24 hours earlier.  I thought it

started only then and I said to him &quot;Look, we still have time to stop

it.  Do something about it.&quot;  He didn't react.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">KEANE:  An Israeli inquiry found that having heard

the Chief of Staff's assurance, it wasn't Ariel Sharon's duty to order any

additional steps.  The Phalange did not

leave when they'd promised.  There was

another three hours of killing and burying the evidence before they

departed.  In the early hours of

Saturday morning, they arrived at Gaza hospital in Sabra.  A panic-stricken Palestinian medical helper

begged the foreign doctors working there to help him.</font></p>

out immediately as we started to walk. 

We didn't get very far.  We

walked for about a minute and he was stopped. 

I saw him on his knees begging and I turned around - we were told to

keep walking - and the next thing I heard was a shot from behind me and I

didn't turn around and look back.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">KEANE:  At around 8 o'clock, 38 hours after they'd

first entered, the Phalangists left Sabra and Shatila.  The first Israeli soldiers to enter the

entered, people were dead or dying.  No

They were all dead or about to be dead. 

It was very clear to see that they were not shot to death, that they

were tortured.  When I understood that

these were the Phalange, the first reaction were these people are killers.  They're really the worst people I've ever

met.  For me immediately you know you go

back to pictures from the holocaust.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">KEANE:  In the rubble were children who'd been

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I was hoping to find my

find their bodies.  You see what

happened, they put them in a house, they killed them and they bulldozed the

houses on them, so we were digging the rubble to identify.  So we pulled the hair of my relative and

that's when we realised that this is the spot where they are there.</font></p>

terrible about it, and they felt that this is the time to disconnect all the

go back to being Israel defence forces.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">KEANE:  An American diplomat at the scene broke news

of the slaughter to his country's special ambassador.  Ambassador Draper sent a furious message to Ariel Sharon saying

he was responsible for the area.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">KEANE:  And you've had no doubt since then or at

that time that Ariel Sharon was responsible?</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DRAPER:  No doubt whatsoever.  Well of course more Israelis have to share

in that responsibility but absolutely.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">KEANE:  The Israeli government had first denied

there had been any Israeli army position in the area and rejected any blame for

what had happened at the camps.  But in

Israel and throughout the world there was public and political

condemnation.  Ariel Sharon was the

target of bitter criticism in Israel's own parliament.  He vigorously defended himself against any

suggestion of responsibility for the massacre.</font></p>

we would never have let them into the camp.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">KEANE:  But the pressure inside Israel did not let

up.  Four hundred thousand people took

to the streets to demand a public inquiry, the biggest demonstration in the

history of the state.  There was unease

too in the army.  </font></p>

and it happened so that suddenly we, the troops in West Beirut, were blamed for

what happened.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">KEANE:  Eventually and against the wishes of Ariel

Sharon, the government set up a judicial commission of inquiry.  It was for the Middle East a unique inquiry.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">KEANE:  Ariel Sharon faced detailed questioning by

the Commission.  His lawyers argued he

hadn't been negligent in failing to stop the massacre, and no reasonable man

could have foreseen the danger.  So how

well did Ariel Sharon know Lebanon's culture of murder?  After one visit in February 1982 he said of

the Lebanese &quot;They're the kind of people who kiss ladies' hands and they

murder.&quot;   Ariel Sharon knew of the

history of hatred between the Phalange and the Palestinians, and he knew that

Christian civilians had suffered savage slaughter at the hands of the PLO.</font></p>

Ariel Sharon ordered his troops to take all steps to stop the Phalange abusing

another group, the Druse.  But why, when

by the most senior judge in Israel, said Ariel Sharon had  <i>&quot;disregarded the danger of acts of

danger into account when he decided to have the Phalangists enter the

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">KEANE:  Ariel Sharon lost his job as Defence

Minister but stayed in the cabinet. 

He's never accepted the finding of indirect responsibility.  But Sabra and Shatila <u>was</u> a war

crime.  The question never asked by the

Phalange.  None has ever been arrested

or charged in relation to what happened in the camps.  Some are now successful businessmen living in Beirut.  Fouad Abou Nader told us he was aware of

Israeli accounts which implicate him and other commanders in the plan to send

men into camps.  He denies any part in

is still living in East Beirut.  His

name is Elie Hobeika.  Hobeika

eventually switched sides, abandoning the Israelis, offering his services to

the Syrians and becoming leader of the militia.  Elie  Hobeika's reputation

as a ruthless killer makes him a man still feared in Beirut.  We've asked him for an interview on a number

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I understand that as a judge

of a South African court you don't want to get into labelling people in other

abuse, I think, a very important value of the international community which the

But when you take the word 'war crimes' or 'punishment of war crimes' or

Elie Hobeika became a minister for refugees in post war Lebanon.  General Amos Yuron, the Israeli Commander

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">KEANE:  If a country launches it's own

investigation, it's own commission, for example the Kahan Commission which is

based really as a moral investigation, is that enough?  Can it be said to have satisfied the

that criminals should be brought to book and if people, regardless of who they

are, are shown by an investigation to have been in breach of the law, then

clearly criminal prosecution should follow, and in the case of Sabra and

committed and I have no doubt any decent person would regret the fact that not

a single criminal prosecution followed.</font></p>
