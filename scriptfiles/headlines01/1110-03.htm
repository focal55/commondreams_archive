MARRAKESH, Morocco  - The first global

multilateral talks since the September 11 attacks ended in

success on Saturday with most of the world declaring it would

push ahead with a major anti-pollution pact, but the United

States will not be joining the party.

</table>Eight months after President Bush shocked many U.S. allies

by pulling out of the Kyoto global warming treaty, the rest of

the world finalized the legal work which should let them bring

it into force without the planet's biggest polluter.

<p>Bush's critics abroad saw that as evidence Washington,

already planning a strategic missile shield, was turning its

back on the concerns of the rest of the world.

<p>The Kyoto pact aims to reduce gas emissions from factories

and exhaust pipes that many scientists say are gathering in the

atmosphere trapping heat -- the so-called greenhouse effect.

<p>U.N. scientists predict the result could be an increase in

average temperatures by up to six degrees Celsius over the next

100 years, leading to rising sea levels, and an increase in

major floods and droughts.

<p>The events of September 11 led Bush to call on his allies

for a global coalition to fight terrorism. At the end of the

two-week climate talks in Marrakesh, many were calling for Bush

to now rejoin what the global fight against climate change.

<p>REASON TO REJOIN KYOTO

<p>``If ever there's a reason to join the United States should

do it now,'' said Dutch Environment Minister Jan Pronk, who

chaired the ill-fated Hague talks on climate change two years

ago when the United States was still a Kyoto participant.

<p>``After the events of September 11, if there is any reason

for the United States to call for international, global

approaches (it should also) join a global approach to the

existing global problem of climate change,'' he told reporters.

<p>``That would add to the credibility of any other approach

which is being sought by the United States seeking a global

answer.''

<p>The Marrakesh agreement sealed the legal text to govern how

the treaty works and, crucially, is meant to give enough legal

certainty for waverers like Russia and Japan to ratify it.

<p>It commits the world's industrialized countries to cut

their greenhouse gas emissions, particularly carbon dioxide, by

an average of five percent of 1990 levels by 2012.

<p>As Russia and Japan indicated that the Marrakesh deal

should make their ratification possible, Kyoto could come into

force without the United States by late 2002.

<p>Canada said the fact that the world had agreed a workable

Kyoto rulebook showed its neighbor was wrong to opt out.

<p>``Canada thinks the American position on Kyoto is wrong. The

basic difference between us is we believe we can succeed in

achieving climate change goals within the Kyoto process, the

Americans believe you can't,'' Canadian Environment Minister

David Anderson said.

<p>``What we've done (by agreeing acceptable rules) is we have

shown our original belief that the Americans are wrong is, in

fact, accurate,'' he said.

<p>NEW NORTH AMERICAN APPROACH

<p>He added that he expected the U.S. to unveil a North

American approach to cutting greenhouse gases which Canada

would probably participate in alongside Kyoto.

<p>``We'll be almost certainly the only country in the world in

that position. So we are very concerned to make sure that the

American system is compatible with Kyoto.''

<p>The United States insists it will not return to Kyoto.

<p>U.S. Under-Secretary of State for Global Affairs Paula

Dobriansky said her country was looking for a global solution

to climate change, one that would be a ``tapestry'' of national

and regional measures, rather than the single worldwide system

provided by Kyoto.

<p>``Our overall goal is the same (as that of the rest of the

world),'' Dobriansky told reporters earlier in the week. ``We

have a common objective which is to address climate change and

to seek reductions of greenhouse gases.''

<p>Environmental campaigners said the United States would now

be forced to make good on that promise, inside or outside

Kyoto.

<p>``The agreement, and the fact that countries will move to

bring the protocol into force, will send strong support to

those in the United States who want to push for action on

climate change,'' Kate Hampton of Friends of the Earth   told

reporters.

<p>Jennifer Morgan of the World Wildlife Fund said that as the

United States had a great input during the years since Kyoto in

helping draft the rules agreed in Marrakesh, some believe a

return should not be too painful.

<p>Many U.S. companies would be pressing for the right to

participate in any future emissions trading market that is

likely to develop under the Kyoto rules, she said.

<p>``This agreement includes many of the elements the U.S. has

been asking for over the years. It is an agreement that the

Bush administration should embrace and come in to.'' Morgan

said.
