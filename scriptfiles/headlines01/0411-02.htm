LONDON   - In a country famed for its love of all creatures

cute and cuddly, animal rights activists are hoping the horrifying

slaughter of nearly a million livestock may have one bright spot:

increased public awareness of farming practices they see as cruel.

</table>Images of dead sheep and cows broadcast on television nightly

during the 7-week-old foot-and-mouth epidemic are forcing many

Britons to confront the sometimes distasteful origins of their beef

roasts and racks of lamb, the activists say.<p>``The response from the public has surpassed everything we've

ever known,'' said Juliet Gellatley, director of Viva, a

Brighton-based group that promotes vegetarianism. ``What people are

saying is they're just sick to death of the way animals are being

treated.''

<p>Viva is among the pro-animal groups that oppose the

foot-and-mouth slaughters outright, saying officials should simply

let the disease run its course and use vaccinations to try to

contain it. Foot-and-mouth's harm, they say, is largely economic,

and its effects on animals are minimal.

<p>``The whole slaughter policy is complete insanity and shows the

brutal indifference of our government and most farmers towards

farmed animals,'' Gellatley said.<p>She and others say the mass culls have given Britons a glimpse

of the brutality that is inherent in so-called ``factory farming,''

which many say subjects livestock to overcrowding, dehydration and

tortuous long-distance journeys to market.<p>``What the images on television have shown people is that the

reality of animals dying is part of industrialized farming, and

they don't like what they're seeing,'' said Andrew Tyler, director

of the pro-vegetarianism group Animal Aid, which is based in

Tonbridge. ``The slaughter and suffering they're seeing now is a

small visible part of what goes on behind closed doors

constantly.''<p>Tyler and Gellatley said they had been besieged by requests for

information on vegetarianism.<p>Foot-and-mouth is not harmful to humans and rarely kills

animals, who generally recover within a few weeks. But because it

decreases their productivity, many countries ban animal imports

from infected nations.<p>Although the disease poses no threat to food safety, its

appearance a few years after the discovery of mad cow disease here

has frightened some Britons off beef.<p>Still, the British Retail Consortium reported that far from

giving up meat, the public was filling its freezers, leading to a

strong 4.8 percent gain in retail sales in March compared to a year

ago.<p>The epidemic has halted British meat exports, and the government

has not authorized vaccination because it would lengthen the time

needed for Britain to regain its ``foot-and-mouth-free'' status.<p>Many animal rights groups acknowledge a need to eliminate the

disease, but they say the slaughter of animals that don't show

symptoms is inhumane and ineffective. A limited slaughter policy

combined with vaccination makes more sense, they argue.<p>Officials now are culling all animals on infected farms and

those adjacent to them. In the worst-hit parts of the country, the

culls apply to all sheep and pigs within two miles of an infection

site.<p>Nearly a million animals have been put down, out of a total of

nearly 1.4 million selected for slaughter.<p>``We do reluctantly have to accept that infected animals may

have to be slaughtered, but it looks as though the government has

taken a real gamble'' by not allowing vaccination, said Julie

Briggs, of Compassion in World Farming, which is in Hampshire.<p>Even mainstream animal welfare groups that support the cull have

called attention to problems with its implementation.<p>Emma Nutbrown, a spokeswoman for the Royal Society for the

Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, said it was investigating many

claims of inhumane slaughter practices. Press reports have said

some animals take hours to die or are buried alive.<p>As a result of foot-and-mouth, animals have been restricted in

their movement. In some cases, that means pregnant ewes are

stranded far from farms, their newborn lambs suffering exposure in

cold, muddy fields, Nutbrown said. In other cases, pigs are kept

cooped up inside, where many are fighting because of overcrowding.

On some farms, feed is running low because animals are not being

let out to graze, she added.

<p>``We've got to take responsibility for ensuring that animals

reared in this country don't suffer, and at the moment they are,''

Briggs said. ``It's unfortunate that it takes a national crisis

like this to (call attention to) welfare standards and how animals

are actually farmed.''
