WASHINGTON  - President Bush  was stunned last

month when told of the extent of the U.S. nuclear arsenal,

Newsweek magazine reported in its June 25 edition, released on

Sunday.

<p>``I had no idea we had so many weapons,'' Bush was quoted as

saying by an unidentified ``White House insider.''

<p>``What do we need them for?'' the president was said to have

asked at a briefing, according to the Newsweek report.

<p>But that was not a dumb question, the magazine noted in

detailing the vast U.S. nuclear arsenal, which includes 5,400

warheads on intercontinental ballistic missiles, 1,750 nuclear

bombs and cruise missiles ready to be launched from B-2 and

B-52 bombers, 1,670 ``tactical'' nuclear weapons and another

10,000 warheads in bunkers around the United States.

<p>That potential for nuclear overkill may be reined in,

however, as Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld prepares at the

Pentagon   to implement Bush's stated goal of streamlining and

downsizing the arsenal.

<p>Rumsfeld has brought back retired Gen. George (Lee) Butler

and former Reagan administration national security guru Richard

Perle to spearhead an effort to reduce the arsenal to safer,

more manageable and more cost efficient levels, Newsweek said.

<p>``I see no reason why we can't go well below 1,000''

warheads, Perle told the magazine. ``I want the lowest number

possible under the tightest control possible.''

<p>``The truth is we are never going to use them,'' Perle added.

''The Russians aren't going to use theirs either.''
