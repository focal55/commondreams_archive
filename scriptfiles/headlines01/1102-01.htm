WASHINGTON  - One historian calls it a ``disaster for

history,'' but the White House insists a new executive order issued

by President Bush balances the public's right to see the records of

past presidents with a need to protect national security.

<p>

	   Advocates for the release of government documents say the

executive order violates the spirit of the 1978 Presidential

Records Act and will usher in a new era of secrecy for papers left

behind by America's chief executives.

<p>

	   The White House says the order simply sets up a procedure for

implementing the act and gives former presidents more authority to

claim executive privilege to withhold certain papers. Absent

``compelling'' circumstances, the incumbent president will agree

with a former president's decision to disclose or withhold

documents, the White House says.

<p>

	   Bruce Craig, director of the National Coordinating Committee for

the Promotion of History, claims the order is ``blatantly unlawful

top to bottom.'' He predicted a quick legal challenge to the order,

which probably will come up at a hearing Tuesday by a House

Government Reform subcommittee. The hearing was scheduled for last

month but was canceled in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 terror

attacks.

<p>

	   Craig said that under the order, if a former president says

certain papers are privileged, they will remain secret even if the

sitting president disagrees. Conversely, if a sitting president

says certain papers from a past administration are privileged, they

will remain under wraps even if the former president disagrees.

<p>

	   ``In the interest of keeping historical papers closed, the

incumbent president can trump the wishes of a former president,''

says Craig, who claims the order is ``a disaster for history.''

<p>

	   In a letter, Bruce Lindsey, lawyer for the William J. Clinton

Foundation, said the former president objects to Bush's executive

order because laws already exist to restrict disclosure of

sensitive documents, The Washington Post reported Friday.

<p>

	   The act affects the presidential papers of Clinton, Bush's

father, George H.W. Bush, and Ronald Reagan. It also applies to

vice presidential papers, including those of former President Bush.

<p>

	   Reagan's papers are the first governed by the Presidential

Records Act, which followed Watergate and Richard Nixon's attempts

to hold on to his papers and tape recordings. The act made

presidential records the property of government, not ex-presidents.

<p>

	   Some 68,000 pages of Reagan's White House records, including

vice presidential papers from the elder Bush, were supposed to have

been opened under the law in January, 12 years after Reagan left

office. The White House delayed the release three times to review

constitutional and legal questions, and Thursday's executive order

resulted.

<p>

	   White House counsel Alberto Gonzales defended Bush's executive

order but did not say when the Reagan papers would be opened to the

public.

<p>

	   White House spokesman Ari Fleischer said the order provides a

``safety valve'' for a current administration. A former president,

out of office for 12 years, might not recognize national security

implications of releasing certain documents, he said.

<p>

	   Fleischer emphasized that ``except in very compelling cases, if

a former president were to say `That (document) should go out,'

this administration would say, ``It should go out.''

<p>

	   Moreover, any claims of executive privilege, including those

involving military, diplomatic or national security secrets, legal

work or advice, presidential communications or the deliberative

processes of the president and his advisers, can be appealed in

court, Gonzales said.

<p>

	   ``It will not be driven by politics or what looks good. It will

driven by what is allowed under the Constitution,'' Gonzales said.

<p>

	   Steven Aftergood, director of the Federation of American

Scientists' government secrecy project, thinks the order will make

it harder for the public to gain access to historically valuable

presidential papers because both the former president and the

incumbent must consent to disclosure.

<p>

	   A private citizen will have little luck trying to persuade a

court to overturn a claim of executive privilege, he said. ``When

Joe Blow goes into court to overturn it, he's probably going to

lose,'' Aftergood said.

<p>

	   Some historians, including American University historian Anna

Nelson, have suspected the Bush White House is worried about what

the Reagan papers might reveal about officials now working for

President Bush who also worked for Reagan. Among them are Secretary

of State Colin Powell, Budget Director Mitch Daniels Jr. and White

House Chief of Staff Andrew Card.

<p>

	   Gonzales says that is not the reason.

<p>

	   ``There may in fact be embarrassing documents,'' he said, but

that would not be considered a legitimate reason to withhold

something.

<p>

	   Other historians suggest the White House is taking advantage of

heightened public interest in national security after the terror

attacks on New York and Washington. Craig speculated that the Bush

White House might be worried the war on terrorism may generate

documents it would rather not see exposed down the road.

<p>

	   ``Everybody is in agreement that materials that can be used by

terrorists to threaten national security should be closed up,''

Craig said. ``There already are existing laws and exemptions that

keep that kind of stuff closed up.

<p>

	   ``This is about confidential information - communication between

a president and top people - that they would simply prefer not to

be released to the public.''
