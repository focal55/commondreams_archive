Early studies of families in three welfare-to-work programs have found unexpected evidence that their adolescent children have lower academic achievement and more behavioral problems than the children of other welfare households.

<P> "The findings are so surprising that they should wake us up and make us think more about what's happening to adolescents," said Martha Zaslow, one author of the study, issued by <a href="http://www.childtrends.org" target="new">Child Trends</a>, a nonpartisan Washington research center.</P>

<P> "Most of the research, and the concerns, have been about how young children's lives would change with welfare-to-work, how their daily care would be different," Ms. Zaslow said. "The early studies have found positive impact on young children, especially in certain subgroups. But the effects for adolescents were negative in all three of these studies. There were no positive findings." </P>

<P> The data, gathered for Child Trends by the Manpower Demonstration Research Corporation, researchers specializing in social policies that affect low-income people, came from welfare-to-work programs in Florida, Minnesota and Canada, all of which were precursors to the federal welfare overhaul. In each of the studies, hundreds of adolescents whose parents had been enrolled in a welfare-to-work program for three or four years were compared with a control group of young people in welfare households where the parents were not in such a program. </P>

<P> In all three places, the adolescents with families in the programs did worse in school than those in the control group, on measures like performing at grade level. </P>

<P> In Florida, 40.7 percent of these 13- to-17-year-olds had been suspended from school, as against only 32.7 percent of the control group. Among adolescents in mother-headed households that had been on welfare for only a short time when the program began, there was also an increased likelihood of arrests, convictions and other involvement with the police. </P>

<P> Adolescents with parents enrolled in the Canadian program showed increased smoking, drinking, drug use and delinquent activity, increased likelihood that teachers called home about school behavior and decreased school achievement. </P>

<P> And in the Minnesota group, families that were short-term welfare recipients were more likely than those in the control group to have received calls from teachers about their adolescent's school behavior. </P>

<P> When the federal welfare overhaul was enacted in 1996, there was some hope that adolescents would benefit from having an employed parent as a role model. The brunt of the worry was reserved for preschool children, who would need new child-care arrangements when their mothers joined the work force. </P>

<P> From these studies of adolescents, though, it seems that working parents shifted some of the household burdens, including care for younger children, onto their teenagers. </P>

<P> Adolescents whose parents were in the Canadian program were performing household chores, among them caring for their siblings, slightly more frequently than those whose parents were not in the program. They were also more likely to be working 20 hours a week or more, a level of employment that previous studies have found to decrease school achievement and increase problem behavior like drinking.</P>

<P> In Florida, too, parental participation in the program increased the likelihood that the adolescent children were caring for younger brothers and sisters. </P>

<P> "Maybe parents are turning to their older kids when they can't find affordable child care for the younger ones," Ms. Zaslow said. "We don't have a good sense of what sibling care means for adolescents, whether it's good or problematic. But there is some concern that these adolescents are having to take on roles that are more suited to the adults in their families." </P>

<P> In most of the measures studied, the differences between the control group and the program group were not vast. But the researchers said it was significant that they occurred across all three programs. </P>

<P> The researchers had no definite answer as to why the programs were having negative effects on the adolescents. But they hypothesized that parents in the programs might have less time and energy to monitor their adolescents' behavior once they were employed; that under the stress of working, they might adopt harsher parenting styles; or that the adolescents' assuming more responsibilities at home when parents got jobs was creating too great a burden.</P>

<P> "We don't know exactly what's causing these effects, so it's really hard to say, at this point, what will be the long-term effects on these kids," Ms. Zaslow said. "It could be problematic for the future, but it could be an adjustment period, as you see in the literature on divorce, where kids move on. What's troubling, though, is that there were no positive impacts found in any of the studies."</P>
