SYDNEY - A decade long slump in military spending

that followed the end of the Cold War has been reversed and

global weapons purchases are rising again, the United Nations 

said on Thursday.

<p>U.S. opposition has sunk moves to strengthen the Biological

Weapons Convention, the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty is

on thin ice and prospects for the entry into force any day soon

of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) are bleak.<p>``Whether one looks at the big weapons or the little ones,

the facts are alarming,'' Jayantha Dhanapala, U.N.

Under-Secretary General for disarmament, said in a speech in

Sydney.<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><table border=0 align=right hspace=5 cellpadding=6 width="170">

The UN Department for Disarmament Affairs is headed by Under-Secretary-General Jayantha Dhanapala of Sri Lanka. Mr. Dhanapala, a career diplomat in the Foreign ministry of Sri Lanka,   held several positions with bodies concerned with disarmament prior to his appointment.

</table></font></font>According to the Stockholm International Peace Research

Institute, global military spending last year reached $800

billion, or $130 for every person in the world.<p>Dhanapala said that represented a ``major increase'' on 1999.<p>The biggest increases in spending were by developing

nations -- the ones which can least afford it -- and ``Southeast

Asia, Northeast Asia are two major sub regions of concern,'' he

said.<p>To put things in perspective, he told a seminar at Sydney's

Macquarie University that the Washington-based Brookings

Institution think-tank had calculated that total U.S. spending

on nuclear weapons amounted to some $5.8 trillion.<p>If you stacked those dollars, the pile would reach to the

moon and almost all the way back to the Earth.<p>DISAGREEMENT RUBS OUT HARMONY<p>But it's not just the growing stock of military hardware

that has the U.N. disarmament chief concerned.<p>Dhanapala told Reuters earlier on Thursday that a palpable

sense of a ``certain harmony, a certain unity'' that existed

among U.N. Security Council members just after the end of the

Cold War, when everyone agreed over Iraq for instance, had

''worn thin.''<p>``We are beginning to see disagreements,'' he said.

<p>In most of the points he makes, a common thread is the

United States of President Bush.

<p>Bush says he will abandon the ABM treaty, regarded as the

cornerstone of nuclear stability for three decades and affirmed

as such by the prior Bill Clinton administration, so Washington

can pursue plans to develop a missile shield.<p>Clinton was on board during a 6- year international

attempt to give more teeth to the Biological Weapons

Convention. The Bush administration has jumped ship.<p>And the new U.S. President has indicated he is unlikely to

resubmit the CTBT to the U.S. Senate for ratification after the

upper house voted it down.<p>In weapons sales, Dhanapala said the United States alone

was responsible for half of last year's arms trades.<p>Yet he said people should not become disheartened.<p>``In disarmament the glass is always either half full or

half empty depending on how you look at it. I think we must not

be totally pessimistic,'' Dhanapala said in the Reuters

interview.<p>``It is true that we are facing a number of challenges

particularly to multilateral disarmament. But I do know that

the United States upholds the nuclear non-proliferation treaty,

it upholds several other treaties, it would want to continue in

several of our disarmament fora.''<p>Dhanapala said ``a la carte multilateralism'' was an in-word

in Washington and the Bush administration was likely to pick

and chose which multilateral agreements it would like to adhere

to.<p>``But it will soon be realized that that is a game that

other countries can also play and therefore it is not in the

global interest for countries to limit their engagement,'' he

said.</p>
