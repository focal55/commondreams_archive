Bove, who gained worldwide notoriety after ransacking a McDonald's restaurant in France, appeared unphased after his sentencing and vowed to continue his anti-globalization campaign
<p>"The fight continues," he said. "No prison sentence or fine is going to prevent us from saying that genetically modified (GM) crops are dangerous."</p><p>He said he planned to appeal the sentence which was below the three-month prison term requested by the prosecution.</p><p>Two co-defendants from Bove's radical Peasant Confederation (CP) farmers' union were also given suspended prison terms. The court in addition ordered the three accused to pay 340,000 francs (51,800 euros, 48,500 dollars) in fines and damages.</p><p>The trio were charged after destroying 3,000 genetically modified rice plants at an international research lab in Montpellier in June 1999.</p><p>During the trial last month, they all admitted destroying the crops in what Bove described as "a battle for the future."</p><p><table bgcolor="#FFFFCC" hspace="2" vspace="2" cellspacing="0" width="150" border="0" cellpadding="3" align="RIGHT" dwcopytype="CopyTableRow">
