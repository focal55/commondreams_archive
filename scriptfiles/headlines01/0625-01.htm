WASHINGTON &#151; Thousands more people than anticipated 

  face health and pollution threats from plutonium and other highly radioactive 

  elements that fouled vast amounts of uranium recycled by the U.S. nuclear weapons 

  program over the past 50 years. Recycled uranium was shipped worldwide from 

  1952 until 1999, when distribution was halted by revelations of its contamination.

<p>Now, new federal studies reviewed by USA TODAY show that 

  the program yielded 250,000 tons of tainted uranium &#151; roughly double the 

  estimates of two years ago. The material was handled at about 10 times the number 

  of sites revealed previously, reaching more than 100 federal plants, private 

  manufacturers and universities.</p>

<p>The studies suggest that thousands more workers than expected 

  might have unwittingly faced radiation risks beyond those associated with normal 

  uranium, increasing their odds of developing cancer and other ailments. That 

  places an unexpected burden on a soon-to-begin federal program to compensate 

  sick nuclear weapons workers.</p>

<p>Contaminants from the tainted uranium also raise the potential 

  for soil and groundwater pollution at some of the newly recognized processing 

  sites. That threatens to complicate cleanup plans.</p>

<p>Most recycled uranium went back into nuclear weapons production 

  or was used as fuel for power reactors. But thousands of tons also were used 

  in everything from academic research to the making of armor for Army battle 

  tanks.</p>

<p>The vast majority of the material contained only traces 

  of impurities &#151; too little, scientists say, to pose risks beyond those 

  posed by natural uranium, which is mildly radioactive and raises health hazards 

  if inhaled as dust. But some plants handled recycled uranium in ways that concentrated 

  its contaminants, significantly boosting its hazards.</p>

<p>"This stuff circulated much more widely than we'd thought," 

  says Robert Alvarez, an official at the Department of Energy when it launched 

  the new studies in 1999.</p>

<p>"The problem is, they really don't have reasonable estimates 

  of how much (contamination) was in a lot of this recycled uranium," adds Alvarez, 

  now a scholar at the Institute for Policy Studies. "It could range from very 

  tiny amounts to relatively high levels."</p>

<p>Federal researchers conclude in the new studies that contamination 

  generally was "extremely low." But that finding masks problems.</p>

<p>The uranium's contaminants apparently were concentrated 

  at a dozen or more previously unrecognized sites, raising pollution and worker 

  health threats. But it's unclear which batches of uranium were most dangerous 

  &#151; or where they went &#151; so not all high-risk sites are identifiable.</p>

<p>Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., says, "The government has a responsibility 

  to follow up."</p>

<b>Military study finds fouled weapons safe</b>

<p>Since the 1980s, the Pentagon has relied 

  increasingly on the super-hard, super-dense qualities of depleted-uranium metal, 

  using it in tank shielding and armor-piercing munitions. And much of it is fouled 

  with traces of plutonium and other dangerous radioisotopes.

<p>The Army got word of the problem in August 1999, when the 

  Department of Energy told commanders that the depleted-uranium armor in the 

  latest Abrams tanks was made with recycled material contaminated during nuclear 

  weapons production. The Army quietly studied 60 samples of the tainted metal 

  before concluding early last year that "the presence of these trace radionuclides 

  in armor is safe."</p>

<p>This year, amid charges that U.S. and NATO troops were 

  sickened from exposure to depleted-uranium "tank-killer" munitions in the Persian 

  Gulf War and the Balkans, the Pentagon revealed publicly that the bullets were 

  made from contaminated metal. Although federal studies suggest that workers 

  who made the recycled uranium metal may face heath risks, military officials 

  insist that the contamination posed no threats in the finished military products.</p>

<p>Even so, at least two branches of the service have abandoned 

  use of the controversial munitions.</p>

<p>The Pentagon's troubles with the contamination have intensified 

  a heated global debate on the use of munitions and military hardware made with 

  depleted uranium, so-called because much of the uranium's natural radioactivity 

  was sapped when it was fed into nuclear reactors to make weapons fuel.</p>

<p>Studies to date support the contention that the levels 

  of contaminants in depleted-uranium metal are tiny and account for little, if 

  any, increase in the already low risks normally associated with the material. 

  Depleted uranium produces a roughly 1% increase in the "background" radiation 

  people normally absorb from sunlight and other natural sources.</p>

<p>But many veterans, environmentalists and public health 

  officials are unconvinced. Their skepticism is heightened by the Pentagon's 

  failure to announce the contamination of munitions and tank armor for more than 

  a year after it learned of the problem. Some experts recommend more study of 

  the mix of radioactive substances.</p>

<p>"You need to check to see if there's a cocktail that includes 

  some of these more radioactive (contaminants)," says Malcolm Grimston, a senior 

  fellow specializing in chemical and nuclear studies at the Royal Institute of 

  International Affairs in London. "You need to redo the calculations."</p>

<p>Munitions appear to be the most widely used military product 

  containing depleted uranium. U.S. forces fired more than 300 tons during the 

  Gulf War. Iraq claims the spent rounds littering its land caused broad environmental 

  damage and increased cancer rates. The same armor-piercing munitions were used 

  extensively by U.S. and NATO warplanes during the 1999 bombing of Kosovo. That 

  prompted ongoing risk studies by NATO and the World Health Organization.</p>

<p>The stakes are high, given depleted uranium's wide military 

  use. A draft document prepared by the Energy Department in 1999 and obtained 

  by USA TODAY shows that the fouled material was shipped to at least 50 U.S. 

  military installations, foreign and domestic, for various uses, ranging from 

  the tank armor and munitions to counterweights in military planes and ships.</p>

<p>Pentagon officials say substantial precautions are taken 

  in using depleted uranium, but there have been problems. In 1999, for example, 

  a maintenance bay at Robins Air Force Base in Georgia was contaminated with 

  mildly radioactive dust after a technician used a hammer to break counterweights 

  made of depleted uranium off a C-141 cargo plane. Urine and blood tests were 

  done on the technician and other workers, but no harm was reported.</p>

<p>Amid all the controversy, the Navy and Marines have decided 

  to abandon use of the depleted-uranium munitions. Both have switched to tungsten, 

  a non-radioactive, high-density metal.</p>

<p>"We're not considering depleted uranium anymore because 

  of the environmental problems associated with it, be them real or perceived," 

  says Col. Clayton Nans, head of the Marines' Advanced Amphibious Assault Vehicle 

  program and former chief of the service's firepower division. "We don't want 

  to be in a position of having someone say, 'You can't bring your armor piercing 

  rounds on the battlefield.' "</p>
