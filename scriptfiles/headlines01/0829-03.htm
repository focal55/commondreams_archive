GENEVA   -  As many as 15 governments and 30 rebel groups still use landmines in two dozen conflicts around the world, despite progress in curbing the weapons, the <a href="http://www.icbl.org/" target="_new">International Campaign to Ban Landmines</a> reported Tuesday.

<p>The group signaled some progress towards curbing production and use of a weapon that generally makes no distinction between combatants and civilians, and until recently was killing as many as one civilian every 15 minutes on average, according to one estimate.</p>

<p>ICBL spokeswoman Susan Walker told a press conference there had been a "dramatic drop in production, with the number of producers going from 55 to 14 in recent years."</p>

<p>She was commenting on implementation of a 1997 international convention banning the use, stockpiling and production of anti-personnel mines. The accord has been ratified to date by 118 countries.</p>

<p>Twenty-eight signatory states had completely destroyed their antipersonnel mine stockpiles, Walker reported. </p>

<p>There were also fewer new mine victim in Bosnia, Afghanistan, Kosovo and Croatia.</p>

<p>Central America, where several conflicts are raging, could become the first region in the world without landmines by the year 2004, Nicaraguan representative Cecilia Sanchez Reyes told journalists.</p>

<p>But the pictures was not all that rosy. "Antipersonnel mines are still used in two dozen conflicts by close to possibly 15 governments and 30 rebel groups," Walker said.</p>

<p>The international aid organization<a href="http://www.savethechildren.org/" target="_new">Save The Children</a> said in a 1999 report as many as 8,000 to 10,000 children a year were at that time being killed by stepping on hidden landmines.</p>

<p>Countless others are maimed, often losing legs.</p>

<p>An ICBL report presented Tuesday said 90 countries remained affected by landmines and new victims had been registered in as many as 70 countries this year alone.</p>

<p>Countries which have not signed the landmine ban treaty include the United States, Russia, China, India and Pakistan.</p>

<p>Asked to comment, Ambassador Steffen Kongstad of Norway who chaired the 2000 review session of signatory states, said: "There is an international norm established that is apparently felt by non signatories: that it is politically uncomfortable not to stick to the norm"</p>

<p>As examples of inhibitions among non-signatories he cited "the US moratorium on exports, indicating a willingness to respect certain parts of the convention." China was likewise not exporting landmines.</p>

<p>Ambassador Jean Lint of Belgium, co-chair of the convention's standing committee, said Chile would ratify soon and Algeria had announced it would ratify. </p>

<p>"A most important announcement was made in June by the Turkish and Greek governments which have decided to join the convention together at the same date," Lint reported. </p>

<p>Isabelle Daoust, legal adviser to the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), outlined the scope of the third convention review session by signatories in Managua next month:</p>

<p>The session would "clarify certain interpretation issues that have started to arise from the treaty: the ICRC remains for example concerned with the sensitivity of certain vehicle mines which may act as anti-personnel mines," she warned.</p>
