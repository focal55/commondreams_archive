British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw has seen no evidence to link Iraq with the September 11 attacks on the US, and has played down speculation that America will take military action against President Saddam Hussein's regime.

<p>In an interview with the British daily the Independent, Straw said: "The decisions which the (US) administration have made have been careful and thought through up to now. I have no reason to think that won't continue."</p>

<p>He added: "I have seen no evidence to support any link (between Iraq and the September 11 attacks).</p>

<p>"On the general issue of military action, it is only ever contemplated on the basis of very good evidence pointing to that necessity and after a very careful conclusion that military action is the only possible option. </p>

<p>"On that basis, the only theatre in which we are currently involved in military action is Afghanistan."</p>

<p>In his interview, Straw also predicted that alleged terrorist mastermind Osama bin Laden, who the British government believes is still in Afghanistan, would be captured.</p>

<p>The foreign secretary said: "My view is that sooner or later he will be found. It is impossible for a man on whom there is that focus and that bounty to escape for long."</p>
