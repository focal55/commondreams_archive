WASHINGTON, July 18 — The Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of American History has offered General Motors<org idsrc="NYSE" value="GM,GMH,GM-G"/> the right to name a new 20,000-square-foot hall of transportation in exchange for a $10 million gift, museum officials said today.

</font></font></font>Spencer Crew, the museum's director, emphasized that the Smithsonian had not reached a final agreement with G.M. But he described the pending arrangement as an appropriate and necessary way of updating the museum, which has many exhibition halls that have not been renovated since it opened in 1964. 

<P> "In order to do these exhibitions, one has to work with the corporate world of donors," Dr. Crew said in a telephone interview. "We're all pretty familiar with this. It is happening everywhere in relations between public institutions and private donors."</P>

<P> Asked whether General Motors would have any say in the content of the exhibition, Dr. Crew replied, "Absolutely not."</P>

<P> "The content and preliminary design for the exhibition," he added, "was a long way in place before any fund-raising was done." </P>

<P> The new exhibition, whose cost is estimated at $20 million, will be called "America on the Move" and will be set up in the vast existing automobile, railroad and maritime halls and in additional space as well. Dr. Crew said one way of crediting General Motors that was under discussion would be to add "in the General Motors Hall of Transportation" under the title. The name would remain for 30 years. </P>

<P> Bill Noack, a company spokesman, declined to confirm that the amount of the gift envisioned was $10 million, but said: "Certainly transportation is a major story in American history, and the one place to tell that story best is the Smithsonian. It's a story that G.M. is proud to help it tell. We have an agreement in principle, and we're moving forward."</P>

<P> Mr. Noack added that General Motors would have "zero input" in the exhibition's content.</P>

<P> The naming of a Smithsonian unit requires approval of the institution's governing body, the Board of Regents, headed by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist. Dr. Crew said that the proposal for the arrangement with G.M. was presented to the board last month and that he understood that the Regents reached agreement in principle among themselves then. They will need to "do a formal recognition of it" when they meet again in September, he said.</P>

<P> Speculation concerning the arrangement, on which the museum began negotiating with G.M. about six months ago, started to spread widely among museum curators and staff members last week. That prompted Dr. Crew to discuss it on Tuesday at a meeting of the museum's branch of the Smithsonian- wide Congress of Scholars, a group of curators, scholars and other researchers. </P>

<P> In an unusual memorandum sent to the Board of Regents in May, a majority of members of the museum's branch of the congress accused Lawrence M. Small, the Smithsonian secretary, of jeopardizing the institution's integrity with agreements he had reached with multimillion-dollar donors. </P>

<P> The memorandum sprang from an announcement in May of a $38 million gift to the museum by the Catherine B. Reynolds Foundation, on condition that it finance a hall of fame to honor American achievers. Ms. Reynolds has made known that among her candidates are the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Jonas Salk, Martha Stewart and Oprah Winfrey, although the Smithsonian will retain authority over deciding which achievers will be included.</P>

<P> The pending arrangement with General Motors has added to the criticism inside the museum of Smithsonian decisions about donor gifts. Some curators and senior officials believe that at the very least, the naming of a transportation exhibition hall for a major automobile company creates an unfortunate perception problem in the minds of a public that is the chief source of financing for the Smithsonian: the institution gets about 70 percent of its funds, or nearly half a billion dollars this year, from Congress. </P>

<P> "We make it very clear we are professional historians and an exhibition tells our story, not the sponsor's," said Barney Finn, curator of the museum's electrical collections, who has worked with corporate donors on exhibitions. "But putting that name up on top gives the perception that the corporation is calling the shots." </P>

<P> Defenders of the arrangement point to precedents within the Smithsonian system. In 1992, the Museum of Natural History renovated its Insect Zoo with $500,000 from the Orkin Pest Control Company and renamed it the Smithsonian's O. Orkin Insect Zoo, for the company's founder.</P>

<P> The Smithsonian's "policy for naming opportunities" states that a corporate donor is to be "encouraged" to consider choosing the name of an individual, not the corporation. Dr. Crew said that this option had been discussed with General Motors but that the company's preference at this stage was to use its own name.</P>
