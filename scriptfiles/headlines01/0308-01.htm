UNITED NATIONS - Four women and three women's
organisations
from war-torn and conflict-ridden nations are first winners of the
new
Millennium Peace Prize for Women, to be awarded Thursday.
<P>
   The prize, the first of its kind, is a global award to honour
the vital
role
that women play in peace-building and the indispensable
contributions they
have made to resolving and preventing conflicts.  <P>
   While the Nobel Peace Prize has been awarded since 1901, only
10 of the
approximately 106 winners have been women or women's
organisations.  <P>
   The Millennium Peace Prize, conferred for the first time on
International Women's Day Thursday, acknowledges women's
leadership in
finding innovative alternatives to war, holding communities
together and
bridging ethnic divides.  <P>
   The award will highlight the often invisible heroic efforts
that women
undertake to end conflicts, said Noeleen Heyzer, executive
eirector of
the UN Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM) on the occasion of the
award's
launch.  <P>
  The prize is being launched as a joint initiative between UNIFEM
and the
London-based non-governmental organisation International Alert
that works
with organisations and individuals to identify the root causes of
violence
and contribute to the just and peaceful transformation of violent
internal
conflict.  <P>
   The first Millennium Peace Prize recipients are Flora Brovina
(Kosovo),
Asma Jahangir and Hina Jilani (Pakistan); Venerananda
Nzambazamariya
(Rwanda), Ruta Pacifica de las Mujeres (Colombia), the Leitana
Nehan Women's
Development Agency (Papua New Guinea), and Woman in Black (based
in
Belgrade). <P>
   ''These women symbolise the future of our dream for this
millennium -
where
adversity can be surmounted and peace can be achieved,''emphasised
Heyzer.
''The prize winners are important role models for millions of
women around
the world who are engaging in strategies for peace at the local
and national
level.'' <P>
   Despite the many challenges they face, women across Asia,
Africa, Europe
and North and South America are already at the forefront of many
peace
efforts.  <P>
   ''In some cases, women have succeeded in collecting arms in
exchange for
hot meals, or they have relentlessly demonstrated and appealed for
the
violence to stop ... Others have formally joined peace
negotiations,
working to
ensure that new constitutions include such legal protections for
women and
girls as access to education, land and property rights and at
least 30
percent
representation in public office,'' Heyzer emphasised.  <P>
   However, even as women around the world are finding many new
platforms to
express their ideas and concerns, women's priorities in countries
suffering
from armed violence continue to be marginalised.  <P>
   This occurs in large part because women's voices are rarely
heard at the
peace table, UNIFEM said in a recent publication entitled
'Women At the Peace Table, Making a Difference'.  <P>
   ''Larger numbers of women must be invited to shape peace
negotiations,''
stressed Kevin Clements, secretary general of International Alert.
''What
vision of peace can we expect if only half of the population is
included
in the process?'' he continued.  <P>
   ''While women are affected disproportionately by violent
conflict, they
are
not passive victims, as they are so often portrayed,'' explained
Clements.  <P>
   The women who have come to New York to receive the Peace Prize
are
inspirational leaders and representatives of organisations that
demonstrate
how to transcend conflict and strengthen our commitment to
restoring
healthy communities, said Heyzer.  <P>
   Brovina of Kosovo is the president of the League of Albanian
Women of
Kosovo, a non-political organisation she founded in 1992 to assist
ethnic
Albanian women. Brovina was accused of and imprisoned for
gathering food,
clothing and medical supplies for the Kosovo Liberation Army
(KLA).  <P>
   Jahangir and her sister Jilani helped to found the Women's
Action Forum to
help women obtain divorces from abusive husbands. In 1986 they co-
founded
the Pakistan Human Rights Commission.  <P>
   Nzambazamariya, who died last year in a Kenya Airways crash off
Abidjan,
dedicated herself to empowering women politically and
economically, and to
restructuring and sensitising Rwanda's imbalanced political,
economic and
social infrastructures and laws that were biased against women.  <P>
   The Ruta Pacifica de las Mujeres movement ensures that women's
alternative
plans for peace and co-existence reach influential circles in
conflict-
ridden Colombia.  <P>
   The Leitana Nehan Women's Development Agency has been a
keystone in the
process of peace negotiations and reconstruction in Bougainville,
Papua New
Guinea since the 1990's. The island has been home to a rebellion
against
the Papua New Guinea government. <P>
   Finally, Women in Black is a worldwide network sponsoring
politics of
resistance, which inspires women in different parts of the world
to organise
action and non-violent protest.  <P>
   On Wednesday, prizewinners met with U.S. congresswomen at a
luncheon on
Capitol Hill where the topic of discussion was women and
international
security.  <P>
   The prizes will be officially awarded at a gala gourmet dinner
Thursday
evening at the U.N. delegates Dining Room. CNN anchor Maria
Hinajosa
and actress Dana Reeve will serve as mistresses of ceremonies, and
celebrities Glenn Close and Lee Grant are expected to be among
those
presenting prizes to the winners.
