RAMALLAH, West Bank  - Palestinian officials on Sunday lashed out at US President George W. Bush, saying his lack on involvement in the escalating Middle East crisis has degenerated into backing for Israeli attacks on Palestinians.

<p>"We used to say there is a vacuum of policy, but it is now clear there is a negative policy toward the Palestinian people which blames them for everything and declares Israel above the law," said Hanan Ashrawi, Arab League spokeswoman and Palestinian lawmaker.</p>

<p>Her comments came after Bush said Friday that Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat must make a "100-percent effort" to halt terrorism if he wants to resume any dialogue with Israel.</p>

<p>She said Bush is "behaving like a spokesman" for right-wing Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, who refuses to start talks until there is a total halt to the unrest that has claimed more than 740 lives in 11 months.</p>

<p>"What Bush has said is very depressing, he is justifying what the Israelis are doing, he is encouraging the Israelis to continue what they are doing and he gives no sign of hope," Palestinian minister for Jerusalem, Ziad Abu Zayyad, told AFP.</p>

<p>"He's giving up the job of the United States as the only superpower which is responsible for security and peace in the world," he added.</p>

<p>In Damascus, Palestinian international cooperation minister Nabil Shaath also blamed "stepped up Israeli aggression in the Palestinian territories" on "the declarations of US President" George W. Bush.</p>

<p>And in Gaza City, top Arafat aide Nabil Abu Rudeina slammed the Israeli use of US-made weapons -- in particular F-16 fighter bombers that pounded Palestinian police stations early Sunday -- in the growing conflict.</p>

<p>"We condemn the use of US warplanes to shell Palestinian institutions, the United States is responsible for the Israeli military escalation," he said in a statement.</p>

<p>"The absence of an effective and pressing role of the United States has given the green light to Sharon's government to persist in its aggression and use of dangerous weapons against the Palestinian people," he said.</p>

<p>Washington already landed in the Palestinians' black books last week when it blocked Palestinian Authority's attempts to introduce a UN Security Council resolution allowing a deployment of international observers to the region.</p>

<p>Israel launched devastating raids early Sunday in retaliation for attacks by Palestinian militants which killed five Israelis. The raids leveled several Palestinian police station, killing one police officer and injuring a dozen other people.
