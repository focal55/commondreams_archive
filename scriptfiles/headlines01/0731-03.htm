DUBAI, July 31 -US military action against Iraq would be suicidal for Washington's interests in the Arab world in the current political climate, an Emirati government daily warned Tuesday.

<p>"A military strike against Iraq will be suicidal for the United States and its interests in the region, with Arab resentment running high against its support for terrorism, racism and the Nazism of Zionism," Al-Bayan said.</p>

<p>"It is surprising that the United States threatens to attack Iraq's air defenses under the pretext that they are posing a danger to their planes," the newspaper said.</p>

<p>"One has to ask what these planes are doing in Iraq's air space ... which they are violating without justification," said Al-Bayan.</p><p>It called on the US administration "to show proof of wisdom, to break with the threats and aggression against the Arab peoples and stop its blind support for the government of the terrorist" Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon.</p><p>"The masks have dropped and the pretexts raised by the United States to continue imprisoning Iraq in a tunnel with no way out no longer stand up," said the Dubai government daily.</p>

<p>The Pentagon is drawing up plans for a major strike against Iraq's air defense system, but US officials are concerned such a strike could end up hurting Washington more than Baghdad, the US TV channel CBS News reported Monday.</p>

<p>Iraq has reiterated it will continue to challenge US-British overflights of Iraqi territory, just days after Washington said Baghdad tried to shoot down a US U-2 spy plane.</p>
