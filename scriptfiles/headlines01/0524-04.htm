ATLANTA - Three security guards have filed complaints accusing U.S. Rep. Bob Barr of cursing and yelling racial slurs after he was denied entry to a private parking lot at Atlanta's Hartsfield International Airport.

<p>

 Reports obtained by WSB-TV show that three guards for Barton Protective Services complained to supervisors, saying Barr yelled at them when they told him he would have to walk from a shuttle to his car because the van was not allowed into the lot.

<p>

 Barr's office released a statement Wednesday saying he had a confrontation with guards Monday, but he did not use racial slurs or obscenities. "While the Congressman does not believe any response is required, he states emphatically and unequivocally that he did not and would not utter a racial slur or remark, or use obscene language," the statement says.

<p>

 "The Congressman believes it is unfortunate that one cannot have a verbal argument, without a self-serving and one-sided report being filed, then leaked to the media, and including utterly false and specious allegations," the statement says.

<p>

 Guard Ramona Phenix, who is black, wrote in her report that Barr cursed at her and used racial slurs when she told him the van could not enter the lot. He said he had several bags and did not want to carry them to the car.

<p>

 Supervisor Alicia S. Gordon, who is also black, wrote a three-page report with guard Frank Lovett. She said Barr became more angry when they decided to let the van into the lot, but not until the driver filled out a form. While the driver was working on the form, Barr became angry again.

<p>

 "This time he yelled, 'When are you going to open the gate you stupid black idiot,'" Gordon wrote.
