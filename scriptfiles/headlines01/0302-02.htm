Ireland has called off its national St.
Patrick's Day celebrations due to fears over foot-and-mouth
disease, organizers said on Friday.<p>The annual national holiday on March 17, to mark the death of
Ireland's patron saint, traditionally attracts some 1.3 million
people to the streets of the Irish capital Dublin for a four-day
festival of music, street theater, and parades.<p>``This will have tremendous knock-on effects, but it's the
disappointment most of all,'' said Maria Moynihan, chief executive
of Dublin's St. Patrick's Festival Board.<p>

</TABLE>Ireland has brought in a raft of precautionary measures
against the spread of an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in
Britain, tightening defenses even further after a confirmed case
of the virus in Northern Ireland this week.<p>St. Patrick's Day -- the largest event in Ireland's national
calendar -- is the latest casualty in a long list of canceled
public activities after most of the country's sporting fixtures
were scratched following pleas from the government.<p>Moynihan said the decision to call off the celebrations had
been a very tough one to make but insisted all efforts would be
made to hold the festival later in the year.<p>``It's not practical to speculate when -- what we're saying
now is that it's no time to have a party or a festival, but that
when we're out of the other side of this crisis it will be time
to have a party,'' she said on Irish state radio.<p>Some 5,000 bands were due to participate in the Dublin
parade, 2,000 of them from the United States, she said.<p>``Most of these would have been U.S. high school kids who have
been planning for this for the last three years -- it's the
biggest trip of their life,'' she said.<p>The implications for Ireland's tourism industry were enormous
with the four-day festival -- this year on March 16-19 -- usually
generating up to 35 million Irish pounds for hoteliers and
restaurateurs in Dublin alone. St. Patrick's Day is also a major
celebration in the United States, where around 40 million people
-- or 15 percent of the population -- can trace their roots back
to Ireland.<p>More than 10,000 people are expected to travel to America
from Ireland to participate in festivities held chiefly in New
York, Boston, and New Orleans.
