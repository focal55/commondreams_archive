BAGHDAD, Iraq &#150;&#150;  Six American and British activists opposed to U.N. sanctions against Iraq said Saturday they had collected fragments of a missile that reportedly killed 23 Iraqis to determine whether it was fired by allied warplanes, as alleged by Iraq.

<p>

The United States had denied dropping bombs Tuesday on a soccer field in Tall Afar, 275 miles northwest of Baghdad. Washington said if there were deaths in the attack, they were likely caused by Iraq's own misdirected ground fire.

A wounded Iraqi boy is shown on Iraqi television June 20, 2001. The Iraqi News Agency INA said U.S. and British warplanes raided Talafar district near the city of Mosul in what would be the bloodiest reported Western attack for two and a half years. Iraq said 23 people, including at leaset one child as young as four, died when the warplanes fired at a playing field in the northern Iraqi town. Britain and the U.S. denied any attack.

</table></font>"We saw a soccer field with a small crater and there were missile fragments, clothes and children's sandals," said Bilal Moose Patel, a 31-year-old British member of the Chicago-based Voices in the Wilderness pressure group.

"The nearest large facility was a grain elevator, which is at least one half to three-quarters of a mile away," he said.

<p>

American activist Philip Steger, from St. Paul, Minn., said he planned to ask the Pentagon to check on the serial numbers on the fragments.

<p>

"Since we now have only initial observation, we are not prepared to draw any conclusions," he told reporters.

<p>

Since arriving in Baghdad on June 14, the three Britons and three Americans have visited Basra, 340 miles south of Baghdad, and the province of Mosul, where the attack allegedly occurred.

<p>

The activists said they want to voice their support for Iraqis suffering under 11 years of U.N. sanctions, imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990.

<p>

Allied aircraft patrol the skies over southern and northern Iraq, zones established after the 1991 Gulf War to protect Shiite Muslim rebels in the south and Kurds in the north from Saddam Hussein's forces. Iraq does not recognize the no-fly zones and has challenged allied aircraft since December 1998.
