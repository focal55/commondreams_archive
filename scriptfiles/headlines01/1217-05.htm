BOSTON   - Harvard University, one of the world's

richest universities, is stingy when it comes to paying hourly

workers, according to a report released on Monday by an alumni

group that has campaigned for increased wages.

<p>``Some of the members of the nonprofessional staff are paid

so little they're eligible for food stamps,'' said Ira Arlook, a

spokesman for Harvard Alumni for a Living Wage.

<p>His group supported students who last May staged a 21-day

sit-in at the Cambridge, Massachusetts, campus that sought a

minimum wage of $10.25 an hour for janitors and other workers,

some of whom earned less than $7 an hour.

<p>The report shows Harvard, with an $18 billion endowment,

paid some workers a starting hourly wage of $9.65. About 1,000

workers, including contract workers and those directly employed

by Harvard, earned less than $10.68 an hour, qualifying most

for the federal food stamp program.

<p>That is far less than the Massachusetts Institute of

Technology, a cross-town rival which pays its workers $14.39 an

hour; or Boston University which pays $14.97 an hour; or

Wellesley College which pays $15.26 an hour. MIT's endowment

stands at $6.5 billion, while Boston University has $662

million and Wellesley College has about $780 million.

<p>Harvard administrators have remained mum about the issue

pending recommendations due later this week from a commission

appointed after the May protests. A preliminary report released

in October showed the number of Harvard direct employees paid

below the so-called ``living wage'' increased from 170 in

September 1994 to 424 in March 2001.

<p>The ``H<a href="http://www.hcs.harvard.edu/%7Epslm/livingwage/portal.html" target="_new">arvard Living Wage Campaign</a>,'' supported by the alumni

group, has urged school officials to pay employees at least $12

an hour and subsidize health insurance and child care.

<p>The Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit group, <a href="http://www.workplacesolutions.org/" target="_new">Wider

Opportunities for Women</a>, estimates that parents must each earn

at least $11.97 an hour at full-time jobs, generating an annual

income of about $43,000, to support a family of four in the

Boston area.

<p>The U.S. minimum wage is $5.15 an hour, compared with $6.75

in Massachusetts.</p>
