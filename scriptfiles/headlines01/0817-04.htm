            The writer Gore Vidal yesterday compared the executed Oklahoma bomber 

            Timothy McVeigh to Paul Revere, the hero of American independence. 

            <P>In a withering address at the Edinburgh book festival, the liberal 

              novelist and elder statesman of the Gore political dynasty said 

              the former soldier decorated for bravery in the Gulf war wanted 

              to send out a warning that the government had been bought by corporate 

              America and "its secret police, the FBI, were out of control. What 

              McVeigh was saying was, 'The Feds are coming, the Feds are coming'. 

              " 

            <P>In his strongest identification yet with the man who confessed 

              to blowing up the Federal Building in Oklahoma City in 1995, killing 

              168 people in retaliation for the FBI's "slaughter at Waco", Vidal 

              described him as a "Kipling hero" with an "overdeveloped sense of 

              justice" who did what he did because he was inflamed by the massacre, 

              the FBI's subsequent cover-up, and the way it "had shredded the 

              bill of rights and the constitution. He was the man who would be 

              king." 

            <P>Vidal, whom McVeigh asked to witness his execution in June after 

              the pair corresponded for three years, insisted McVeigh did not 

              actually carry out the bombing, and hinted he was now close to revealing 

              the names of those who did. 

            <P>"I am about to drop another shoe. I have been working with a researcher 

              who knows at least five of the people involved in the making of 

              the bomb and its detonation. It may well be that McVeigh did not 

              do it. In fact, I am sure he didn't do it. But when he found out 

              he was going to be the patsy, he did something psychologically very 

              strange. He decided to grab all credit for it himself, because he 

              had no fear of death." 

            <P>Vidal maintained this was because "McVeigh saw himself as John 

              Brown of Kansas", the anti-slavery campaigner who was executed after 

              leading a raid into the south which sparked the American civil war. 

            <P>Vidal alleged that the FBI not only knew about the plot, it was 

              involved in it. Having infiltrated the rightwing militia group that 

              planned it, it did nothing because it wanted to pressure President 

              Clinton into pushing through draconian anti-terrorist legislation 

              he was refusing to sign. "Within a week of the bombing, Clinton 

              signed it for 'the protection of the state and of persons', using 

              the exact language that Adolf Hitler used after the Reichstag fire 

              of 1933." 

            <P>America was in the grip of what he called "a revolutionary situation" 

              because wealth had become concentrated in the hands of only 1% of 

              the population. "The truth is that 80% are not doing well, and many 

              of those are farmers out in the mid-west who have been driven off 

              their land by big business. They are the backbone of the militia 

              movement. Many of them are as crazed as you can find. But they number 

              over 4m, 300,000 of which are active." 

            <P>Vidal revealed that having had his last meal of mint ice-cream 

              with chocolate sauce, McVeigh spent his last hours watching the 

              Coen Brothers' film Fargo on a black and white TV. "It's a great 

              film but bloody, a body is shredded and suchlike, and not quite 

              what he wanted to see, poor fellow." 

            <P>He saved his greatest venom for Janet Reno, the attorney general 

              during the 52-day Waco siege, for "persecuting a perfectly harmless 

              bunch of religious nuts" and for presiding over the "lies and cover-up" 

              that followed it. "Her mother was a very famous alligator wrestler 

              in Florida, a family profession she herself should have pursued."
