As peace activists prepare for demonstrations tomorrow in San Francisco 

and Washington, D.C., organizers say they will hit on themes that will sound 

far different from the ones voiced in anti-war protests of years past.

<P>"Protesting this war will take innovative strategies that have to respond 

to situations that will be very fluid," said Jerry Sanders, a University of 

California at Berkeley professor of peace and conflict.

While organizers are still groping to find those new strategies, they 

realize that stopping traffic, flag-burning, love-ins and most other vintage 

anti-war demonstrations won't register with people still mourning one of the 

deadliest days in American history.

<P>As the Rev. Cecil Williams of San Francisco said, "None of that stuff is 

going to fly now."

<P>Organizers say the 10,000 people expected at tomorrow's rally in Dolores 

Park in San Francisco will promote their cause by emphasizing what all 

Americans share: grief for the dead and missing, and condemnation for their 

attackers; a desire to bring those responsible to justice, despite differences 

on how to do that; and a fear of ways the world is changing.

<P>The new peace activists say America must win its war at home and not let 

the push for increased security lead to racial profiling and the scapegoating 

of Arab Americans and others of Mideast and South Asian origin.

<P>Advocates of nonviolence believe their window of opportunity is narrow. 

Peace isn't an easy sell in these flag-rimmed days, with polls showing strong 

support for a military response to the attacks in New York and near Washington.

<P>"As soon as American GIs start losing their lives, then it will be 10 times 

harder for the peace movement. Then, everyone will be focused on 'supporting 

our boys,' and there will be a lot of pressure not to disrupt that," said 

Humboldt County activist David Meserve, who has been encouraging his Arcata 

neighbors to contact Washington leaders from a fax machine in the back of his 

truck.

<P>Activists are encouraged by recent polls. Those taken immediately after the 

attack found near-unanimous support for a counterattack, even if innocent 

civilians were killed, but several polls taken this week showed support for 

that course of action slipping to roughly 70 percent.

<P>"People are afraid," said Medea Benjamin, a longtime activist who will 

speak at Saturday's rally. "Afraid of biological weapons, of being blown up as 

they drive across the Bay Bridge. Once fear replaces that bloodlust, then the 

arguments of the peace movement gain more weight."

<P>Organizers say they are energized by recent comments from the Bush 

administration officials cautioning Americans not to expect an instant 

counterattack. And like the administration leaders who say the war on 

terrorism will be different from others America has fought, those in the peace 

movement say their tactics will change, too.

<P>Tomorrow's multicultural lineup of speakers spans four generations, and 

will be accompanied by musical styles ranging from hip-hop to spoken word to 

John Lennon's "Imagine." Organizers say that's another change from '60s-style 

war protesters, who warned against trusting anybody over 30 and often were led 

by white, middle-class college students.

<P>But this weekend's solidarity may weaken should the war drag on.

<P>Sanders said it would be increasingly difficult to protest a war that 

administration officials say will be largely unseen by the American public -- 

fought by covert agents, small groups of commandos and cyberspace jockeys. 

There may be no nightly TV news footage to rally protesters, as there was 

during the Vietnam War and other conflicts.

<P>So instead of adopting yesteryear's confrontational, us-vs.-the-

establishment tone, peace marchers will talk about common ground.

<P>"Everyone wants to 'get' these guys," said Kevin Danaher, co-founder of 

Global Exchange, one of several co-sponsors of tomorrow's San Francisco event. 

"But what does 'get' mean? For us, it does not mean more military action."

<P>Past protesters sometimes sympathized with Washington's opponents -- the 

Viet Cong, the Sandinistas or the Cuban government -- but Benjamin said, 

"There's no one who will talk about how the other side is 'good.'

<P>"We have nothing positive to say about these terrorists."
