PARIS - The United States is on course for vastly exceeding the target it set less than four years ago for limiting its emissions of "greenhouse" gases, the cause of global warming, a new study indicated Friday.

<p>In 2008, US carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from energy use will be 35 percent higher than in 1990, according to the study, conducted by a French consultancy, Enerdata.</p>

<p>CO2 is the biggest culprit among six gases blamed for causing a slow but potentially dangerous rise in the Earth's atmospheric temperature.</p>

<p>The United States pledged in 1997, when it signed the UN's Kyoto Protocol on global warming, to reduce its emissions of these gases by seven percent by a 2008-2012 deadline compared with the level in 1990.</p>

<p>However, that goal has looked increasingly ambitious -- and costlier to achieve -- in the light of poor US energy efficiency and years of sustained growth, which has caused American fuel consumption to rocket.</p>

<p>President George W. Bush announced in March that he would not submit Kyoto for Senate ratification, contending it was "unfair" to the US economy.</p>

<p>His main argument was that Kyoto does not commit big developing countries to a specific target of cutting greenhouse-gas emissions, only industrialised nations.</p>

<p>Enerdata said that CO2 emissions in the United States and Canada had increased by 16 percent between 1990 and 2000. </p>

<p>CO2 accounts for 80 percent of the volume of the six greenhouse gases. The Enerdata figure applies to CO2 derived from burning fossil fuels such as oil, gas and coal; the gas can also be released from industrial processes and agriculture, but in far smaller quantities.</p>

<p>Kyoto was signed in 1997 in the Japanese city of that name. It commits 38 industrialised countries to reducing overall output of greenhouse gas by an average of 5.2 percent by the 2008-2012 timeframe compared with 1990.</p>

<p>However, it was left to subsequent negotiations to flesh out Kyoto's rulebook, and this task has been arduous.</p>

<p>Talks aimed at completing the treaty fell apart last year in the dying weeks of the Clinton administration, and the future of the accord now lies in the balance after the defection of the Bush government.</p>

<p>Negotiations resume in Bonn, from July 16-27.</p>

<p>The United States by itself accounts for a quarter of global greenhouse gas emissions.</p>

<p>The European Union (EU) vowed to reduce its emissions by eight percent under Kyoto.</p>

<p>Enerdata said CO2 output from the EU's energy use was virtually unchanged, being 0.4 percent lower last year compared with 1990.</p>
