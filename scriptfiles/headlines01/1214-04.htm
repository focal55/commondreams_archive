BEIJING  - The U.S. withdrawal from the 1972

Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty was a threat to world peace which

could spark a new arms race, China Daily, the Communist Party's

premier English-language newspaper, said on Saturday.

<p>``Experts have warned of a turbulent world after the U.S.

pull-out. It could unravel more than 30 other crisis-preventing

accords, undermining international security,'' the paper said in

an editorial.<p>The editorial was accompanied by a cartoon of a missile

flying the American flag targeting a frightened peace dove.

<p>President Bush announced the decision to withdraw from the

Soviet-era treaty this week so that Washington could proceed

with tests on a missile defense system.

<p>China Daily said the unilateral decision could actually

threaten the security of the United States, likening the move

to policies which, it said, caused the September 11 attacks.<p>``He (Bush) ignores the role the ABM pact has played in

maintaining world peace and keeping with the interests of the

United States,'' it said.<p>The newspaper said the treaty had prevented a global arms

race and acted as a bedrock for preventing a nuclear crisis.<p>Critics and some analysts of the U.S. pullout fear it could

encourage China to build more missiles that could reach U.S.

soil and spark a new arms race between Asian nuclear players.<p>China's rival India could acquire more warheads, which

might in turn encourage Pakistan -- an ally of Beijing -- to

boost its nuclear arsenal.<p>U.S. OFFICIALS TO VISIT<p>U.S. officials will travel to China next week to explain

Washington's position.<p>``We've made quite clear that missile defense is not against

China's strategic deterrence,'' State Department spokesman

Richard Boucher said on Friday, announcing the trip.<p>``We don't believe our deployment of a limited national

missile defense should lead Beijing to expand its buildup of

strategic nuclear forces,'' he said.<p>China's Foreign Ministry declined on Sunday to immediately

comment on the planned visit.<p>On Friday, China responded to the U.S. decision with a calm

call for multilateral talks, in a move analysts said showed

Beijing was keen to keep ties with the United States on a

positive track despite strong opposition to missile defense.<p>``The United States should not ignore the potential threats

against itself from a legal vacuum of arms control. In a world

full of conflicts and crisises, its security would inevitably

be at stake,'' the China Daily editorial said.
