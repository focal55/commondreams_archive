WASHINGTON - Four out of five U.S. students --

both boys and girls -- complain of sexual harassment at school

from verbal taunts to unwanted touching, according to a report

released on Wednesday.

<p>The study by the American Association of University Women

(AAUW) Educational Foundation, said despite a zero-tolerance

policy in most schools, students faced sexual harassment both

in words and actions, often right under a teacher's nose.

<p>``Sexual harassment is part of everyday life for boys and

girls at school,'' said Jacqueline Woods, executive director of

the AAUW, an advocacy group pushing for equity in education for

women and girls.

<p>Most of the students surveyed said their school had a

policy about harassment compared to just a quarter in a 1993

AAUW study. However, this ``sea change'' in policy had not

translated into fewer incidents.

<p>``Parents, teachers and administrators need to do a better

job educating our children on what is and what isn't

appropriate,'' said Woods.

<p>The report, called ``Hostile Hallways II, Bullying, Teasing

and Sexual Harassment in School'', was based on a survey of

2,064 public school students between 8th and 11th grades. The

margin of error for the survey is plus or minus five percent.

<p>It found 83 percent of girls and 79 percent of boys had

suffered harassment of one form or another, roughly the same

number reported in the 1993 survey.

<p>Of the students, 76 percent experienced nonphysical

harassment, such as taunts, rumors, graffiti, jokes or

gestures, while 58 percent endured physical harassment.

<p>Students were given a definition of sexual harassment as

''unwanted and unwelcome sexual behavior that interferes with

your life.'' It did not include behaviors they might welcome,

such as ``wanted kissing, flirting or touching.''

<p>GIRLS AFFECTED

<p>Girls were more likely to be report being negatively

affected by harassment than boys, with 44 percent of girls

feeling ``self-conscious'' against 19 percent of boys because of

an unpleasant incident.

<p>Girls were more likely to change their behavior in school

and at home because of the experience, including not talking as

much in class (30 percent to 18 percent) and avoiding the

person who harassed them (56 percent to 24 percent).

<p>Girls were consistently more likely to say they would be

''very upset'' by all 14 examples of nonphysical and physical

harassment presented to them, from spreading sexual rumors

about them to pulling off their clothing in a sexual way.

<p>However, both boys and girls were ``very upset'' over taunts

on their sexuality and being labeled gay or lesbian, with 74

percent of boys and 73 percent of girls feeling this way.

<p>``This response is disturbing as it points to the area of

homophobia in schools,'' said Pamela Haag, the foundation's

director of research.

<p>The foundation said the survey proved the problem of

classroom harassment could not be shrugged off as normal

pre-teen and teen-age behavior.

<p>Haag said there was a ``code of silence'' among students who

were reluctant to report an incident to a teacher or another

adult for fear of recrimination from their peers.

<p>The National Education Association, which represents about

2.6 million teachers, said it planned to form a task force with

the AAUW to address sexual harassment in schools by training

adults to intervene effectively to stop the problem.

<p>``For children who are constantly picked on, ridiculed or

harassed, school becomes torture,'' said NEA president Bob Chase

in a statement.
