WASHINGTON   - The Earth will become a much hotter

place over the next century, according to researchers who

predict in a study published on Friday there is a 90 percent

chance the planet's average temperatures will rise 3 to 9

degrees Fahrenheit by 2100.

<p>Researchers at the National Center for Atmospheric Research

in Boulder, Colorado, used a computer model to predict probable

long-term increases in the Earth's temperature if no actions

are taken to curb the emissions of gases and pollutants that

many scientists blame for global warming.

</table></font>The researchers said the planet has warmed up by about 1

degrees over the last century. But they say it is likely to

heat up by about 1 or 2 degrees as early as 2030.

<p>By 2100, the most likely increase would be in the range of

4 to 7 degrees, while there is a 90 percent chance global

average temperatures will rise 3 to 9 degrees, they said.

<p>Tom Wigley, the lead researcher, said a broad range of

possible long-term temperature changes does little to assist

policy makers. For example, an estimated global warming range

of 2.5 to 10.4 degrees was announced this year by the

Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), established

in 1988 by the U.N. World Meteorological Organization  and U.N.

Environment Program.

<p>Wigley said the new study aimed to tell policy makers what

level of global warming is most likely.

<p>World leaders have been at loggerheads over what steps

governments need to take to reduce emissions -- especially

after the United States withdrew in March from the 1997 Kyoto

Protocol, a global deal to cut pollution.

<p>UNCERTAINTIES WEIGHED

<p>He said the computer model sought to account for various

uncertainties that could impact warming.

<p>``There are two that absolutely dominate,'' Wigley, whose

study appears in the journal Science, said in an interview.

<p>``One is human beings, and uncertainties in things like

population and economic growth and technological development

and awareness of environmental issues. Those human and

socioeconomic uncertainties essentially produce a very wide

range of possible emissions for the gases that might cause

changes in climate in the future,'' he added.

<p>The other primary uncertainty factor, Wigley added, is just

how sensitive the Earth's climate system is to man-made

influences.

<p>Some critics say there is scant evidence of a man-made

cause of global warming.

<p>New estimates of sulfur dioxide and other emissions, along

with updated information on carbon storage, ocean circulation,

radiation, and other components of the Earth system have

improved computer climate models, the researchers said.

<p>Even aggressive action to curb so-called greenhouse

emissions and other factors that may contribute to global

warming may be too late prevent continued temperature rises,

Wigley said.

<p>``The climate system is like a giant flywheel. Even if we do

a lot of things in the near future to try to reduce emissions

or reduce the growth of emissions, then the system has a lot of

inertia and it is going to keep warming for a long, long time,''

Wigley said.

<p>``So already in place are a lot of unavoidable climate

change consequences no matter what we do. But that doesn't mean

we should give up. And there are a lot of things we can do. And

what we have to do is balance the economic cost against the

environmental cost.''

<p>In a commentary in Science, experts at the Massachusetts

Institute of Technology and the University of North Carolina

note the difficulty in making such temperature predictions.

<p>``Future emissions of greenhouse gases, their climatic

effects and the resulting environmental and economic

consequences are subject to large uncertainties,'' said the

experts, led by MIT's John Reilly.

<p>Many scientists believe emissions of certain pollutants

from industry, power plants, vehicles and other sources

threaten to disrupt global climate and ecosystems by causing

the Earth's atmosphere to trap more of the sun's energy,

triggering global warming.
