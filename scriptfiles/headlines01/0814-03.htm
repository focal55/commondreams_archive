            UNITED NATIONS -- "Whiskey's for drinking, water's for fighting about," 

            Mark Twain is said to have observed, and on Monday, scientists warned 

            that more people may be fighting over water this century than over 

            oil.<BR>

            <BR>

            A report issued Monday at the U.N.-sponsored World Water Forum in 

            Stockholm says that one in three people will not have access to enough 

            water by 2025 and that it is unlikely that traditional agriculture 

            could feed the world's population by then. Already, bottled drinking 

            water costs more per gallon than gas around the world, and it is bound 

            to become even more precious.<BR>

            <BR>

            Water shortages affect about 450 million people in 29 countries, and 

            tensions over water rights in Asia and Africa could erupt into serious 

            clashes if governments don't find new ways to use existing supplies 

            more efficiently, the report warns. "Water could become the new oil 

            as a major source of conflict," Dutch Crown Prince Willem-Alexander, 

            chairman of the 2000 World Water Forum, said after opening the Stockholm 

            conference Monday.<BR>

            <BR>

            "Increasing scarcity, competition and arguments over water in the 

            first quarter of the 21st century will dramatically change the way 

            we value and use water and the way we mobilize and manage water resources," 

            he said.<BR>

            <BR>

            From clashes over the use of local watering holes to disagreements 

            between countries over the right to dam a shared river to corporations' 

            desire to privatize distribution, water has already become a major 

            source of strife. While few wars have been fought over water outright, 

            political disagreements are intensified when such essential resources 

            become scarce.<BR>

            <BR>

            Californians are familiar with the challenges of making a city grow 

            from a desert. Just as Los Angeles had to siphon water from rivers 

            and watersheds hundreds of miles away as its population exploded, 

            rapidly expanding cities in Asia and sub-Saharan Africa are thirsting 

            for adequate supplies for drinking and sanitation.<BR>

            <BR>

            Despite innovations that have lowered costs of water treatment, more 

            than a billion people still lack safe drinking water, said Sandra 

            Postel, director of the Global Water Policy Project based in Amherst, 

            Mass. "We're running as fast as we can just to stay in one place," 

            she said.<BR>

            <BR>

            Rural, agricultural areas are threatened the most, the report says. 

            A combination of global warming, wasteful practices and pollution 

            means that major rivers that traditionally have been relied on by 

            millions of people are now running dry for part of the year. The Yellow 

            River in China, the Nile in Africa and the Indus and the Ganges in 

            south Asia don't always reach the sea during the dry season, leaving 

            farmers struggling. Agricultural scientists are trying to find ways 

            to grow more food with less water to prevent famine in the next 25 

            years.<BR>

            <BR>

            "There's not enough water available to produce enough food. That's 

            the problem," said Peter Gleick, director of the Pacific Institute 

            for Studies in Development, Environment and Security in Oakland.<BR>

            <BR>

            There is no shortage of answers when scientists, government leaders 

            and environmentalists gather at a meeting like the one in Stockholm--just 

            a lack of consensus.<BR>

            <BR>

            There are many small things that can be done that could have broad 

            effects on water use around the world, Gleick said. Farmers can choose 

            more water-efficient crops to produce "more crops per drop." Consumers 

            can rethink their diets: It takes 16 times as much water to produce 

            a ton of beef as a ton of grain, Gleick said.<BR>

            <BR>

            "There are people who say we're heading for disaster and those who 

            say we don't have a problem," he said. "It all depends on the choices 

            we make."
