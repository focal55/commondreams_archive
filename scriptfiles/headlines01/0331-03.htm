WASHINGTON  - Smarting from attacks both here and

abroad on his

unilateral abandonment of the Kyoto Protocol to curb global

warming, US

President George W. Bush Thursday insisted that the world will

benefit from

a stronger US economy unhampered by restrictions on greenhouse-gas

emissions. 

<P>

In a confusing statement just before meeting with German

Chancellor Gerhard

Schroeder, the US president told reporters that he intends to

consult with

European and other leaders about global warming, but that he would

not ''do

anything'' that could set back the US economy. <P>

''I will explain as clearly as I can today and every other chance

I get, that

we will not do anything that harms our economy, because first

things first are

the people who live in America; that's my priority,'' he said. <P>

''I'm worried about the economy; I'm worried about the lack of an

energy

policy. It's in our national interests that we develop a strong

energy policy

with realistic, common-sense environmental policy,'' he said.

''And I'm going

to explain that to our friends. It is in their interest, by the

way, that our

economy remain strong - after all, we're a free-trading

administration - we

trade with each other.'' <P>

Bush was expected to get an earful from Schroeder about European

reaction to

the decision, which was formally confirmed Wednesday by White

House spokesman,

Ari Fleischer. <P>

''The president has been unequivocal,'' Fleischer told reporters,

confirming an

earlier statement by the head of the Environmental Protection

Agency (EPA),

Christine Todd Whitman, who had tried hard over the past two weeks

to persuade

Bush not to abandon the 1997 Protocol. ''He does not support the

Kyoto treaty.

It is not in the United States' economic best interests.'' <P>

While the White House statement had been signalled in a letter to

four

right-wing senators two weeks ago, when Bush reversed a campaign

pledge to

curb

emissions by US power plants of carbon dioxide, few thought his

abandonment of

Kyoto would come out quite so quickly and bluntly, particularly

given the

importance attached to the Protocol by Europe and Japan,

Washington's closest

allies. <P>

Bush has stressed from the outset that his administration would

set as its top

foreign-policy priority consolidating ties with the allies. <P>

But both European and Japanese diplomats have expressed growing

unease at a

number of unilateral moves by Bush since his inauguration in

January,

including

his rebuff of South Korean President Kim Dae Jung's ''sunshine''

policy toward

North Korea; his expulsion of 50 Russian diplomats in retaliation

over a spy

case; and his seemingly determined pursuit of national missile

defence (NMD),

which US intelligence experts have warned could provoke a new arms

race. <P>

In that respect, the latest move is certain to contribute to

anxiety. In an

effort to persuade Bush to continue participating in the Kyoto

process,

Whitman

herself warned in a leaked memo that most US allies considered

Kyoto ''the

only

game in town''. <P>

''Mr. President,'' she urged, ''this is a credibility issue for

the US in the

international community. We need to appear engaged and shift the

discussion

from the focus on the K-word (Kyoto) to action, but we have to

build some bona

fides first.'' <P>

When he reversed his campaign pledge the following week, the

European Union

(EU) sent a delegation who met with National Security Adviser

Condoleezza Rice

to gain assurances that Washington would still be engaged in the

Kyoto

process.

On the contrary, however, Rice reportedly told them that, so far

as the United

States was concerned, Kyoto was dead. <P>

''It's a textbook case of unilateral diplomacy, which rarely works

and always

brings resentment,'' said David Sandalow, who helped negotiate the

Protocol

under the Bill Clinton administration. <P>

Ironically, the Protocol came out of a series of negotiations

among

industrialised countries that followed a climate-change convention

signed by

Bush's father at the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro. Under

Kyoto,

signatory states agreed to cut their greenhouse emissions by about

5.2 percent

below 1990 levels by the year 2012. <P>

Greenhouse gases - including carbon dioxide, which is emitted by

the

combustion

of fossil fuels, like coal and oil - are believed by most

scientists to be

responsible for the accelerating warming of the Earth's atmosphere

over the

last century. <P>

In its latest report, the UN's International Panel on Climate

Change (IPCC)

estimated that average temperatures on the Earth's surface could

rise by as

much as 5.8 degrees Celsius by the year 2100 if present emission

trends are

not

altered, with potentially catastrophic consequences. <P>

While Clinton and other western leaders signed the Protocol, no

parliament has

ratified it, as the precise mechanisms by which those reductions

could be

achieved are still being hashed out in negotiations, the last of

which took

place at The Hague late last year. The next round is scheduled for

Bonn in

July. <P>

The US Senate, which would have to ratify the accord, strongly

opposed the

Protocol due to concerns over its potential impact on the US

economy - a

subject of major debate between the energy industry and

environmentalists -

and

the fact that developing countries were not covered. Bush raised

the same

objections in his letter to the senators. <P>

Given Washington's diplomatic weight and status as the world's

biggest emitter

of greenhouse gases (about 25 percent of total emissions), its

withdrawal

could

mean the collapse of the entire negotiations, according to both

environmentalists and diplomats here. <P>

''Bush's decision to abandon America's commitment to the Kyoto

Protocol has

created the most serious international environmental policy crisis

in years,''

according to Christopher Flavin, president of the Worldwatch

Institute.  <P>

''It is time for Europe and Japan to call the US bluff and adopt

the Kyoto

Protocol, perhaps abandoning some of the more problematic elements

insisted

on by the United States (during the negotiations).'' <P>

''As the world's last remaining superpower, and its largest

producer of

greenhouse gases, the United States has a special obligation to

lead on this

issue,'' said Fred Krupp of the New York-based Environmental

Defense. ''It is

bad for America's interests for the United States to be seen as

the rogue

nation of greenhouse gas pollution.''
