            WASHINGTON, Aug. 13 &#0151; At the height of the foot-and-mouth epidemic 

            in Europe, at least three quarters of a million pounds of prohibited 

            meat found its way into inspection warehouses in the United States, 

            the Agriculture Department's inspector general reported. 

            <P> The internal report said the department needed to be more vigilant 

              if it was to continue keeping foot-and- mouth disease from breaking 

              out in this country and infecting American livestock.</P>

            <P> In limited spot checks last spring, agriculture inspectors found 

              756,000 pounds of prohibited meat in warehouses in port cities in 

              New Jersey, Maryland, Texas and other states. The meat was not allowed 

              to be distributed, and some of it was destroyed. The report did 

              not indicate whether any of the meat had been contaminated by the 

              disease. But the inspectors said the meat should never have crossed 

              the border.</P>

            <P> The inspectors found more holes in the system than they had expected. 

              Compounding the problems, in this age of explosive increases in 

              agricultural trade, the agencies that control animal and plant diseases 

              still work without a central computer database, the report said. 

              Many safety officials still record entries by hand into ledgers.</P>

            <P> In his July 23 report, Roger C. Viadero, the inspector general, 

              said the department needed "more stringent controls to ensure that 

              meat products entering the United States were free" of foot-and-mouth 

              disease.</P>

            <P> Ann M. Veneman, the secretary of agriculture, said today that 

              she had accepted the report's recommendations and was tightening 

              inspection procedures.</P>

            <P> "As soon as the report came out," Ms. Veneman said in an interview, 

              "we immediately responded to make sure we're doing everything we 

              can."</P>

            <P> She faulted Congress, however, for refusing her request for $35 

              million in emergency aid to improve the inspection system, including 

              creating the database.</P>

            <P> Without an increase in financing to hire more staff members and 

              track shipments, many health experts fear that other diseases besides 

              foot-and- mouth disease will enter the country.</P>

            <P> "We're relying on the same system of controls to prevent mad cow 

              disease," said Caroline Smith DeWaal of the Center for Science in 

              the Public Interest. "It's clear that with the increase in outbreaks 

              of animal disease, the agency needs more money and more staffing 

              to fulfill their mandate."</P>

            <P> Her group filed a petition last week with the Agriculture Department 

              asking for greater controls of meat products that could contain 

              fragments of spinal cords, where mad cow disease is often found.</P>

            <P> In Britain, more than 3.5 million animals have been slaughtered 

              in an effort to isolate and eradicate the foot-and-mouth disease. 

              Yet British farmers continue to report an average of three new cases 

              of foot-and- mouth disease every day, a testament to the disease's 

              ability to spread.</P>

            <P> To prevent the disease from entering the United States and threatening 

              the country's $50 billion meat industry, the Bush administration 

              banned the import of meat and meat products from the European Union 

              in March.</P>

            <P> Safety and health inspectors were added at airports and border 

              posts to prevent the prohibited meat from entering the country and 

              infecting any of its 170 million cattle, sheep and pigs. All borders 

              were put on heightened alert, and Ms. Veneman issued statements 

              saying that the disease would not spread here.</P>

            <P> So far, there have been no reports of the disease in the United 

              States.</P>

            <P> But the inspector general found near-miss instances where prohibited 

              meat could have left the warehouses to be sold in American markets.</P>

            <P> Nearly 260,000 pounds of prohibited meat was stored in an unsecure 

              area in Elizabeth, N.J., the report said. In Texas, a shipment of 

              32,000 pounds of sausage casings made from prohibited sheep, beef 

              and hogs was sent from the Port of Houston to San Antonio without 

              authorization.</P>

            <P> Mr. Viadero said the lack of coordination was caused by confusion 

              about each agency's responsibility and the lack of modern equipment 

              that would allow them to communicate with each other.</P>

            <P> The report strongly recommended pushing ahead with a planned database 

              to keep track of imports &#0151; the Port Information Network Operations, 

              which could be in service in 2002.</P>

            <P> A sophisticated computer program is required to control and account 

              for the increasing volume of trade, the report said. More than 16 

              million trucks and 5 million large maritime containers crossed United 

              States borders in 1999.</P>

            <P> Since border officials are charged with stopping the illicit narcotics 

              trade as well as monitoring compliance with many laws, some experts 

              who have read the report said luck must have played a role in keeping 

              out foot-and-mouth disease.</P>

            <P> "It's pretty amazing they've succeeded so far," said Ken Cook, 

              of the Environmental Working Group. "They're stuck with a human-intensive 

              manual system that dates from the 1940's."
