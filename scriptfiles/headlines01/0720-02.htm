BOGOTA, Colombia  - President Andres Pastrana's U.S.-backed

offensive against drug crops has hit a flurry of domestic

opposition from critics who say aerial spraying harms people and

the environment, punishes poor farmers and has failed to stem drug

trafficking.

<p>The groundswell against Plan Colombia comes as the U.S. Congress

debates new aid for Colombia and Washington prepares to deliver

sophisticated helicopters as part of a $1.3 billion aid package

approved last year in support of the program.

</font>The first three of 16 Blackhawk helicopters are expected to

arrive by the end of July and the remainder by December. The

helicopters will give greater mobility to U.S.-trained army

battalions assigned to destroy jungle drug laboratories and provide

security against rebel fire for aerial spraying missions using

crop-killing herbicides.

<p>The State Department also expects to deliver four additional

crop-dusting planes next month and eight more by February.

<p>Colombian and U.S. officials have given repeated assurances that

the eradication push only targets large-scale coca and opium

plantations operated by drug traffickers. They say the chemical

used, a variant of the popular backyard fertilizer Roundup, is

ecologically harmless and safe for humans.

</table></font></font>But environmentalists, human rights activists and small farmers

- who say their crops are also being hit - remain staunchly

opposed.

<p>Their arguments are now echoing on the political level, where

governors from the main drug-producing states, Colombia's top human

rights official, the nation's comptroller general and a leading

lawmaker from Pastrana's own party came out this week against the

policy.

<p>Conservative Party Sen. Juan Manuel Ospina said Thursday he

plans to introduce legislation sharply scaling back forced aerial

fumigation, requiring more emphasis on aid to help farmers switch

to legal crops, and decriminalizing small drug plots. Fumigation

``has been absolutely ineffective in reducing or eliminating the

areas under cultivation,'' Ospina said in an interview.

<p>At a congressional hearing Wednesday, Comptroller Carlos Ossa

called for fumigation to be suspended altogether, saying it is

proceeding without an approved environmental protection plan.

Federal human rights ombudsman Eduardo Cifuentes also demanded a

stop, adding that government offers of compensation for poor

farmers are lagging far behind the spraying.

<p>Earlier in the week, six governors from some of the country's

main drug producing states forced a meeting with top officials in

Bogota in which they warned current policies could provoke mass

protests in their regions.

<p>So far, Pastrana shows no signs of bending.

<p>Spraying of heroin plantations continued this week in Cauca and

Narino, even as those states' governors were in Bogota registering

their protests. Anti-narcotics police chief Gen. Gustavo Socha

blamed the criticism on ``drug traffickers'' spreading

disinformation.

<p>Any scaleback in forced eradication would likely put the

government at odds with Washington, whose number one priority in

Colombia is the drug war. Colombia is the world's leading cocaine

exporting nation and a major supplier of heroin to the United

States.

<p>U.S. Ambassador Anne Patterson on Wednesday reaffirmed aerial

eradication as a ``key'' to its aid program. The embassy has

commissioned a study it believes will refute claims that the

spraying is causing respiratory and skin ailments among farmers and

their families.

<p>The U.S. Congress last week began consideration of an $882

million follow-up aid package floated by the Bush administration

for Colombia and its Andean neighbors. Concerns about fumigation -

and the military's human rights record - are expected to arise.

<p>A leading conservation group, World Wildlife Fund, sent a letter

to members of Congress last week warning that fumigation threatens

Colombia's biodiversity and urging a moratorium ``at least until an

adequate environmental impact study has been conducted.''

<p>The latest controversy follows what U.S. officials are calling a

successful start to the eradication push, which began late last

year in Putumayo, the largest coca-growing province.

<p>Since January, according to official figures released here this

week, spraying has done away with 128,000 acres of coca - more than

one-third of the amount U.S. officials estimated was growing in

Colombia at the end of last year. Gonzalo de Francisco, the

government's point man for Putumayo, said he has also signed up

more than 40,000 peasant families in agreements to manually

eradicate their coca in return for aid to grow legal crops.
