The ongoing turmoil at listener- sponsored WBAI/99.5 FM spilled onto the air
yesterday when Amy Goodman, longtime co-host of the morning show "Wakeup Call,"
was cut off during the broadcast and threatened with firing. Goodman is one of
two surviving members of the program after a "Christmas coup" in which a new
station manager was named and several veteran staffers were dismissed.
<P>
The national board of the Pacifica Foundation, which owns WBAI, has been trying
to exert control over a five-station network traditionally based on listener
support and local control.
<P>
According to accounts provided by Goodman and e-mail from a listener, Goodman
had been saying she hoped the fired personnel will be reinstated, when new
co-host Clayton Riley-after arguing with her about bringing the matter up-
ordered her mike cut off.
<P>
Shortly afterward, interim station manager Utrice Leid said, according to a
tape played by Goodman, "If anyone dares to come in here and disrupt your
[Riley's] program again-what I heard is absolutely unacceptable. You [Goodman]
will not be permitted to interrupt, to damage the editorial integrity of this
program or any other." Leid also said, "I will deal with this directly after
the show."
Goodman, who has been co-host of "Wakeup Call" for eight years, said later, "I
was taken aback. This is a very bad situation."
Leid wouldn't discuss what had happened or say whether Goodman still co-hosts
the show.
