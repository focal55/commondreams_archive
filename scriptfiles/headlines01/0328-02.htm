SUESCHENDORF, Germany  - Anti-nuclear protesters who

dodged security forces to chain themselves to railtracks forced a

train bearing atomic waste on Wednesday to retreat near the end

of its journey to a dump in north Germany.

<p>Riot police broke up a separate blockade attempt further down

the tracks after charging a group of some 200 activists who

staged a sit-in on the line.

Wielding pneumatic drills and heavy bolt cutters, police

freed three of the five protesters who had attached themselves by

their arms to tubes cemented into the bed of the rail line but

they could not say when the train could move again.

<p>``Once the people have been removed, the tracks will need to

be repaired,'' said a police spokesman on the scene in

Sueschendorf, 16 miles from the Dannenberg depot where the waste

is due to be unloaded onto flatbed trucks for its final journey

by truck to the Gorleben dump on the Elbe river.

<p>``It could take 10 minutes or it could take hours,'' he added.

<p>The train, traveling since Monday from a waste reprocessing

plant in northern France, withdrew to nearby Dahlenburg for

refueling and maintenance.

<p>The action, carried out overnight by an environmentalist

group called Robin Wood, delayed further the arrival of the six

''Castor'' containers of reprocessed nuclear waste which had been

scheduled on Tuesday.

<p>``It's an amazing success to force the Castors to turn back,''

said one protester, saying this was the first such retreat since

controversial transports of reprocessed waste starting in 1995.

<p>Some 20,000 police have been deployed to guard the shipments

in one of Germany's largest peacetime security operations.

A group of around 200 activists briefly staged a separate

sit-in protest on the tracks in Dannenberg before being charged

by baton-wielding riot police. A small number of protesters

responded by firing flares and throwing stones before retreating.

One was knocked unconscious during scuffles.

<p>

``It was a shame, we could have had a good peaceful occupation

of the track with two or three hundred people,'' said Matthias

Hofmann, a 27-year-old student from Hanover who said he had taken

part in many anti-nuclear protests.

<p>``If they can't send their waste to France then the reactors

will have to be shut down,'' he said, describing the blockades as

''strangulation tactics'' on German nuclear plants which do not

have their own reprocessing facilities.

<p>Police deployed water cannon and detained nearly 600 people

Tuesday evening after protesters fired flares and threw stones.

They said the scuffles were provoked by leftwing activists, some

of whom used slingshots to pelt police with stones.

<p>If and when the train reaches its destination at Dannenberg,

loading is expected to take between eight and 12 hours before the

final 16 mile road journey to Gorleben.

<p>Under pressure from France to reduce a backlog of German

waste at its La Hague reprocessing plant near Cherbourg,

Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder lifted a transport ban imposed on

safety grounds in 1998. Two cargoes a year are now planned.

<p>The transports are part of a deal struck with the electricity

industry last year to phase out Germany's 19 reactors by about

2025 -- a timeline considered too long by anti-nuclear

activists.
