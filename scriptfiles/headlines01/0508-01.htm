ROME   - The developing South has become the dump for

hundreds of thousands of tonnes of radioactive waste from the

world's rich countries, a colossal business which is linked to

money laundering and gunrunning, say lawmakers and activists in

Italy. 

<P>

   ''The trafficking of radioactive waste, a large part of which

goes to countries of the South, constitutes a business of gigantic

proportions, amounting to more than seven billion dollars a year

in Italy alone,'' Massimo Scalia, the chairman of an investigative

commission set up by the Italian parliament, told IPS. <P>

   Scalia said that every shipload of nuclear waste represents

around five million dollars in profits. <P>

   The Italian justice system is investigating the trafficking of

radioactive waste to the developing South, particularly African

countries like Somalia, Sudan, Eritrea, Algeria and Mozambique. <P>

   The information gathered in the two main legal probes, carried

out in the northern Italian cities of Milan and Asti, and the data

compiled by the parliamentary commission demonstrate that two of

the methods for getting rid of such waste are dumping it into the

sea in special metal containers designed to sink to the bottom, or

purposely sinking the ship carrying the waste, and reporting it as

an accident. <P>

   Some of the shipwrecks are being investigated by Lloyd's, the

British insurance company. <P>

   Maurizio Dematteis with the Italian environmental umbrella

Ligambiente 2001 said there were already more than 600,000 tonnes

of radioactive waste on the floor of the Atlantic ocean along the

coast of the western Sahara. <P>

   He also said there were three enormous illegal dumps - among

the largest in the world - in Somalia, where workers handle the

radioactive waste without any kind of safeguard or protective gear -

not even gloves. <P>

   The workers do not know what they are handling, and if one of

them dies, the family is persuaded to keep quiet with a small bit

of cash, the activist added. <P>

   Dematteis believes the murder of Ilaria Alpi, a young

journalist with Italy's state TV station RAI, was linked to the

trafficking of guns and radioactive waste. <P>

   Alpi was killed in Somalia on Mar 20, 1994, apparently after

she discovered too much about those illegal activities. <P>

   Meanwhile, Italy's Chamber of Deputies has not yet passed a

bill that has already made it through the Senate. Once it is

passed, the new law will make ''the illegal trafficking of waste''

a specific offence in the criminal code. Today, that activity is

only subject to administrative sanctions. <P>

   Italy's legislature is in recess prior to the May 13

parliamentary elections. <P>

   The current legislation does not allow the justice system to

effectively clamp down on the trafficking of radioactive waste,

because the violations expire three or four and a half years after

they are reported. <P>

   Prosecutor Giovanni Tarditi explained that those found guilty

of engaging in such activity are generally fined. Moreover, the

fines are not high, he said, especially when compared to the huge

profits involved in trafficking nuclear waste. <P>

   Judicial police inspector Gianni De Podestá, who is waging a

determined struggle against the ''eco-mafia'', said ''we are often

forced to resort to charges of tax evasion to arrest the

traffickers. <P>

   ''The evidence accumulated throughout months of investigations

is frequently not enough. But that will change once trafficking is

made a crime,'' he added. <P>

   Mozambique is the final destination for many of the new routes

for trafficking toxic waste from industrialised countries,

according to the Scalia commission, which takes its name from its

chairman. <P>

   Experts say another area that will increasingly accept such

waste in the future is eastern Europe, where nuclear waste has

already been found at the bottom of the Black Sea, off the

Rumanian coast. <P>

   A report by Ligambiente 2001 indicates that Italy is a source

and transit country for radioactive waste that is shipped to

Somalia, Malawi, Zaire, Sudan, Eritrea, Algeria, and Mozambique. <P>

   The trafficking of radioactive and other waste is merely a

corollary to other illegal activities like money laundering and

the trafficking of arms and drugs, warns Ligambiente. <P>

   Poor countries are victims of that illegal trade, which

constitutes a threat to their biodiversity and culture, and hurts

their chances for development, said Dematteis. <P>

   The trafficking of nuclear waste once again reveals the

capacity of criminal organisations to continually develop new

activities which the international community is not prepared to

combat, he added.
