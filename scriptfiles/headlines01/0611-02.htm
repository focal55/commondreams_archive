MADRID  - The execution of Oklahoma City bomber

Timothy McVeigh Monday unleashed condemnation across Europe on

the eve of President Bush's first official visit to the

continent.

<p>European opposition to the death penalty outweighed

abhorrence at McVeigh's crime when he was put to death by

lethal injection at an Indiana prison for a 1995 blast that

gutted a federal office building and killed 168 people.

<p>Critics of capital punishment called it a barbaric,

blood-thirsty way of making McVeigh pay for his crime.

<p>``By executing the first federal death row prisoner in

nearly four decades, the USA has allowed vengeance to triumph

over justice and distanced itself yet further from the

aspirations of the international community,'' the London-based

human rights group Amnesty International said.

<p>America's penchant for the death penalty puts it ethically

at odds with its traditional European allies, which have all

banned it. The last person executed in the European Union  was

killed by guillotine in France in 1977.

<p>``The death penalty is a barbarism inappropriate to our

times,'' said Antonio Maria Pereira, president of the Portuguese

human rights group Law and Justice.

<p>CASTS SHADOW OVER BUSH VISIT

<p>Controversy surrounding McVeigh's execution could cast a

shadow over Bush's five-nation tour, which is expected to draw

street protests not only against the death penalty but also

against his policies on missile defense and global warming.

<p>Some European media have depicted Bush as a ``serial

executioner'' because of his record as governor of Texas where

152 executions took place during his nearly six years in

office.

<p>The United States and Japan are the only two rich,

industrialized democracies that still regularly put convicted

criminals to death.

<p>Many Europeans are puzzled that the United States, a

country that holds itself up as a model of democracy and human

rights, continues to carry out death sentences.

<p>McVeigh's execution had particularly strong resonance in

Spain, where Bush was due to arrive Tuesday morning on the

first stop of his European tour.

<p>Joaquin Martinez, a 30-year-old Spaniard who was convicted

and then cleared of double murder in the United States,

returned home Sunday after spending three years on Florida's

death row.

<p>Martinez's ordeal sparked public outrage in Spain, which is

still haunted by memories of thousands of summary executions

carried out during the 1939-1975 dictatorship of Generalisimo

Francisco Franco.

<p>``This doesn't solve anything. The politics aren't based on

justice,'' said Pepe Mejia, spokesman for a coalition of Spanish

groups planning protests against Bush's visit to Madrid.

<p>Unlike the Martinez case, few Europeans doubted McVeigh's

guilt in the worst terror bombing in U.S. history. But many

slammed the U.S. government for using a form of punishment that

they consider cruel and outdated.

<p>``McVeigh committed a horrible crime. What he did or why he

did it is not being discussed -- what is being discussed is the

death sentence,'' said Sergio D'Elia, secretary of a protest

group that demonstrated outside the U.S. embassy in Rome.

<p>``Bush built his race to the White House on a road paved

with those have been put to death,'' she said.

<p>Pope John Paul II had joined with human rights groups in

appealing in vain for Bush to spare McVeigh's life.
