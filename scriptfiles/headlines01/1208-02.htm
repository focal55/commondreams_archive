The new Secretary General of Amnesty International is visiting Pakistan to highlight the plight of Afghan refugees.

<p>Irene Khan is due in Peshawar to visit refugee camps and meet Afghan victims of human rights abuse.</p>

<p>The visit comes after Amnesty called for an inquiry into the mass prison killings in Qala-i-Jhanghi fort.</p>

<p>It follows new video footage of events shortly before the deaths at the fort near Mazar-e-Sharif</p>

<p>Hundreds of Taliban and al Qaida fighters were killed in the uprising last month.</p>

<p>An Amnesty International spokesman said: "The video footage which has emerged is alarming and strengthens the case for an urgent inquiry into what happened at the fort.</p>

<p>"The reported conduct of the CIA operatives is disturbing, specifically the apparent threat of execution.</p>

<p>"All personnel involved in the custody and interrogation of prisoners should be fully aware that death threats against prisoners violate international human rights and humanitarian law.</p>

<p>"The US, UK and United Front should reconsider their position and hold an inquiry without further delay.</p>

<p>"Amnesty International has suggested that they consider calling on the UN or the International Fact-Finding Commission to conduct a preliminary inquiry."</p>
