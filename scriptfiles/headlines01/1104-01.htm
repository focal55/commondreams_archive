ROME  - The <a href="http://www.fao.org/" target="_new">United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization</a> (FAO) acknowledged, as

                 it opened its biennial conference, that efforts aimed at eradicating world hunger - a problem that led to

                 the foundation of the agency 56 years ago - have been a ''tragic failure.' ' 

<p>

                 The FAO Conference in Rome, which lasts through Nov 13, was originally intended as a lead-in to the World Food

                 Summit: Five Years Later, which had been slated to take place Nov 5-9. 

<p>

                 But the summit, convened to renew commitments by the international community to combat hunger, was postponed

                 as a result of the global tensions created by the Sep 11 terrorist attacks in New York and Washington and the

                 subsequent military strikes by the United States against Afghanistan. 

<p>

                 The heads of state are now scheduled to gather here Jun 10-13, 2002, to assess hunger eradication efforts and

                 discuss new approaches. 

<p>

                 In the interim, the FAO warns, the distressing situation of people suffering from hunger could worsen dramatically

                 due to the stagnation of the global economy. 

<p>

                 The Food Summit will give the world's leaders an opportunity to make stronger commitments and to move forward

                 with renewed will in the fight to reduce hunger, says the specialized agency of the UN. 

<p>

                 Delegates from FAO's 183 member states - with three countries joining the rolls Friday - are taking part in the

                 conference under way in the Italian capital. 

<p>

                 Among the proposals being considered are the adoption of an international accord on phytogenic resources and a

                 new code of conduct for the use and distribution of pesticides. 

<p>

                 The participants will also debate the FAO work program and budget for the 2002-2003 period. 

<p>

                 The 31st session of the FAO Conference paid homage to Frank McDougall, one of the founders of the agency in

                 1945, as Patricio Aylwin, former president of Chile (1990-1994) delivered the inaugural address, known as the

                 McDougall Memorial Lecture. 

<p>

                 Aylwin pointed out that McDougall had believed it would be possible to eradicate poverty and hunger in the world

                 within one generation. ''How could it possibly happen that 56 years later we have not succeeded in eradicating either

                 hunger or poverty?'' he wondered. 

<p>

                 The causes of this ''tragic failure'' originate in the lack of political commitment among rich countries to help poor

                 countries, in the failure of the developing South to help its own poor populations, and in erroneous economic

                 approaches, he said. 

<p>

                 ''Deified neoliberalism and omnipotent markets'' are at the core of a mistaken vision of the global economy and ''the

                 root cause of some of the most serious problems that afflict us,'' stated the former Chilean president. 

<p>

                 Latin American economies grow more slowly in the 1990s after they implemented the structural adjustments

                 prescribed by international financial institutions like the World Bank and International Monetary Fund, said Aylwin,

                 citing figures from the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC), a UN regional agency. 

<p>

                 In that region, the number of people living in poverty rose during the last decade from 196 million to 224 million, he

                 said, adding that ''this reality is a serious obstacle for development, it constitutes a moral scandal and it seriously

                 threatens social peace.'' 

<p>

                 Aylwin outlined how aid from the world's rich countries to developing nations had fallen from an average 0.33 percent

                 of gross domestic product (GDP) in 1992 to 0.24 percent in 1999, despite the fact that the industrialized world had

                 promised in 1970 to boost international assistance to 0.70 percent of their GDP. 

<p>

                 FAO director-general Jacques Diouf invited the former Chilean president to give this year's McDougall lecture as a

                 ''statesman deeply engaged on issues of freedom and justice, who notably influenced the strengthening of

                 democracy in the entire Latin American region.'' 

<p>

                 Aylwin was Chile's first democratically elected president following the military dictatorship led by Gen. Augusto

                 Pinochet (1973-1990). 

<p>

                 He said in an IPS interview that the current international situation will make the battle against hunger increasingly

                 difficult because, in addition to the destruction created by war, governments will be spending more on weapons -

                 instead of on food or development efforts. 

<p>

                 The fear existing around the world will have negative repercussions for Latin America. Furthermore, the dominant

                 climate is not favorable for economic cooperation or growth, stated Aylwin. 

<p>

                 Luca De Fraia, coordinator of the Italian non-governmental organization Sdebitarsi, which advocates writing off poor

                 countries' debts, agreed that the rise in military spending would complicate efforts to fight hunger. 

<p>

                 Italy spends as much on defense as it does on social assistance, or 1.6 percent of its GDP. This is eight times more

                 than the funding earmarked for environmental protection, and 12 times more than its expenditures for aid to the

                 developing world, he said. 

<p>

                 The ''tragic failure'' of the fight against hunger is confirmed by the latest FAO reports, which show a lack of progress

                 toward meeting the goals set at the 1996 World Food Summit for halving the number of people suffering hunger

                 worldwide by 2015. 

<p>

                 The UN agency's studies indicate that the decline in the hungry population since the summit five years ago is

                 ''absolutely insufficient.'' The number - calculated at 800 million in 1996 - has fallen by an average of just six million

                 each year, and not by 20 million, as would be needed to achieve the established goal. 

<p>

                 If immediate action is not taken, the aim of halving the number of malnourished people in the world will be put off

                 another 60 years, warns the FAO.
