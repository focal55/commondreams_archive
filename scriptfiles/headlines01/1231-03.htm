QALAYE NIAZI, Afghanistan  - U.S. warplanes killed

over 100 people in a raid on a village in eastern Afghanistan,

residents said Monday, as British troops arrived in the capital

to take up peacekeeping duties.

<p>At least one fighter jet, a B-52 bomber and two helicopters Sunday morning swooped on the village of Qalaye Niazi, about

2.5 miles north of the city of Gardez, capital of eastern

Paktia province, villager Janat Gul told Reuters.

<p>Paktia province is where U.S. forces have been carrying out

operations against remnants of Osama bin Laden's al Qaeda

network and Taliban fighters still on the run.

<p>``There are no al Qaeda or Taliban people here,'' said Gul,

referring to the group blamed for the September 11 attacks in

the United States, and the former government which sheltered

it.<p>The raid seemed sure to stir up tensions between factions

in Afghanistan's interim administration which want the U.S.

bombing campaign, under way since October 7, to halt, and those

who believe it should continue.<p>The Defense Ministry, headed by General Mohammad Fahim,

says the bombing should end as soon as possible while Foreign

Minister Abdullah Abdullah said Sunday that ``the campaign will

continue for as long as it takes to finish the terrorists.''<p>There are also tensions within the administration, headed

by Hamid Karzai, over the role of foreign forces on Afghan

soil.<p>But an advance column of about 50 British troops drove into

Kabul Monday to take up peacekeeping duties, the vanguard of an

international security force that was agreed with the new

government.<p>The new administration and Britain have initialed an

agreement on deployment of the force, authorized by the U.N.

Security Council to fill the security vacuum in Afghanistan

after the collapse of the Taliban, a British official said on

Monday.<p>The force is eventually expected to number 3,000.<p>SOLE SURVIVOR<p>Janat Gul said 24 members of his family were killed in the

pre-dawn U.S. bombing raid on Qalaye Niazi, and described

himself as the sole survivor.<p>



``People are very upset about what is going on here,'' he

said.<p>Paktia province borders Pakistan and is southwest of the

jagged canyons of Tora Bora -- one of the last stands of al

Qaeda fighters. It was heavily bombed in early December when

bin Laden was believed to be hiding there.<p>At least 12 houses in Qalaye Niazi were razed. Amid the

destruction, a Reuters Television cameraman saw scraps of

flesh, pools of blood and clumps of what appeared to be human

hair. Huge craters had been blasted out by the strike.<p>A member of the local tribal shura, or council, said they

had invited U.S. forces to the village to see the damage and to

find out what had happened.<p>In the U.S., Major Pete Mitchell -- a spokesman for U.S.

Central Command -- said: ``We are aware of the incident and we

are currently investigating.''<p>Reuters passed several four-wheel drive vehicles containing

U.S. forces, accompanied by soldiers of the Northern Alliance

which took Kabul in November, at the Tira Pass, apparently en

route to the village. They refused to allow photographs or to

speak to reporters.

<p>The Pentagon believes remnants of al Qaeda and the Taliban

may be still in Paktia. Several raids have been carried out

there in the last few days.

<p>One of the most deadly took place just two days before the

inauguration of the new government, when U.S. jets hit a convoy

carrying tribal elders and guests to the ceremony in Kabul.<p>Some 65 people were killed in that attack, and interim

leader Hamid Karzai has told tribal elders that he would ask

the Americans to cut back their raids in the region.<p>With bin Laden, the main target of the U.S. war on

terrorism, still at large and possibly hiding in Afghanistan,

U.S. troops were on their guard throughout the country.<p>In the south, Marines prepared to hand over to arriving

U.S. paratroopers a Kandahar airport facility, including a

detention camp where detained Taliban members and al Qaeda

fighters are being interrogated as to his whereabouts.<p>The Pentagon said the deployment of paratroopers from the

101st Airborne Division in southern Afghanistan would free

Marines operating there for unspecified duties, possibly to

join the hunt for bin Laden.
