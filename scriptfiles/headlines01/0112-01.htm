            Monitoring groups sounded the alarm Friday after genetic engineers 

            in the United States and Australia crossed into unexplored territory, 

            raising anxiety about research ethics and fears of bio-terrorism.

<p>Australian scientists reported Thursday they had accidentally engineered 

              a killer virus closely related to smallpox while trying to devise 

              a treatment to block fertility in mice.</p>

            <p>The same day, US scientists announced they had created the world's 

              first genetically-engineered primate: a rhesus monkey with a jellyfish 

              gene.</p>

            <p>ANDi -- the name is "inserted DNA" spelt backwards -- was given 

              the gene to provide a harmless fluorescent marker in the skin. The 

              idea is to provide a laboratory indicator when testing monkeys with 

              potential cures for human diseases.</p>

            <p>But to some minds, these twin developments took biotechnology a 

              frightening step too far, raising questions about security and the 

              temptation to tinker with human genes themselves.</p>

            <p>"This is just the start. Now we're talking about small numbers 

              of animals and gene markers, but what will happen in the future 

              is that scientists will either add or knock out genes in primates 

              to see what happens to them," said the British Union for the Abolition 

              of Vivisection.</p>

            <p>"The end result is terrible suffering. It's bad enough using rodents, 

              but for scientists to play God with primate genes is morally abhorrent."</p>

            <p>Disquiet is shared by many with scientific and medical knowledge.</p>

            <p>Some say the Australian incident showed how a killer virus could 

              be built accidentally -- and the ease with which it could be assembled 

              by a rogue state or terrorist group.</p>

            <p>"Our understanding of how genes work in a normal environment is 

              very poor," said Sue Meyer, a veterinary surgeon and doctor in biology 

              who is spokesman for Genewatch, a British pressure group.</p>

            <p>"When you insert a gene into another organism, you can't control 

              where the gene goes, its orientation or how many copies it is going 

              to make, and you can disrupt other functions in the organism.</p>

            <p>"Most of the risk assessment in genetic research are done in a 

              mechanistic way, as if one and one equals two, and do not allow 

              very much for the unexpected and the unpredictable, which is what 

              happened in the Australian case.</p>

            <p>"Genetic modification is not as straightforward as some people 

              would have us believe."</p>

            <p>As for genetically-altered monkeys, these commentators said such 

              research would always be troubled by questions of ethics, given 

              public opposition to experimenting on the closest relation to Man.</p>

            <p>"Using modified monkeys will continue to raise problems in this 

              regard," said leading French geneticist Axel Kahn, director of research 

              at France's National Institute for Health and Medical Research (INSERM). 

              "The public finds it much easier to accept using (modified) mice."</p>

            <p>Even though animal primates share some 95-99 percent of human genes, 

              there remain important genetic distinctions between monkeys and 

              Homo sapiens, which raises questions as to the usefulness of using 

              these animals in some areas of research.</p>

            <p>"Some of the work on cognitive diseases, such as schizophrenia, 

              can only be carried out in people," pointed out Patrick Bateson, 

              chairman of a working group on modified animals in the Royal Society, 

              a top British association of scientists.</p>

            <p>Meyer said the two incidents exposed the need for "greater public 

              scrutiny about what goes on in laboratories and greater openness" 

              to prevent abuse of genetic knowledge, as well as a wider debate 

              into the fundamental principles of research.</p>

            <p>"If we're not careful, we may not learn the lessons from this kind 

              of thing."
