            BOGOTA, Colombia - Brushing aside human rights concerns, President 

            Andres Pastrana signed ``war legislation'' granting Colombia's U.S.-backed 

            military expanded powers to battle insurgents, his office announced 

            Thursday. 

            <p>

	   U.N. rights monitors, human rights groups and some members of

the U.S. Congress have criticized the measure, fearing it will lead

to abuses in Colombia's 37-year war.

<p>

	   The law, which Pastrana signed without fanfare on Monday, is

expected to be challenged by its opponents in the nation's

Constitutional Court and could affect deliberations on future U.S.

military aid to this South American country.

<p>

	   One of the law's most criticized articles allows the president

to set up martial law zones called ``theaters of operations,'' in

which local civilian officials would be subordinate to regional

police and military commanders.

<p>

	   The law also allows soldiers to detain suspects longer before

handing them over to a judge.

<p>

	   Amnesty International, in a statement from New York, said:

``There is serious concern that these provisions could facilitate

torture or other forms of human rights violations of those captured

during counterinsurgency operations.''

<p>

	   The law also shortens the time allowed for completing

investigations into alleged human rights abuses by security force

members and requires civilian prosecutors to report to the military

on their investigations into terrorism and war crimes including

torture.

<p>

	   A leading Colombian human rights activist said the measure would

militarize the country.

<p>

	   ``There will be arrests without warrants, interrogations of

civilians on military bases and impunity for soldiers and police

who have violated human rights,'' predicted Gustavo Gallon,

director of the Colombian Jurists' Commission.

<p>

	   Pastrana has not spoken publicly on his decision to sign the

National Defense and Security Law, which Colombia's congress

approved in June.

<p>

	   But one of the law's authors said Colombia needed tougher

legislation given the nation's serious crisis. ``The Colombian

people are cornered by violence,'' Sen. German Vargas said. ``We

need instruments to defend ourselves.''

<p>

	   The military, which pushed hard for the legislation, says

Colombia's laws have hamstrung its ability to fight leftist

guerrillas and right-wing paramilitaries.

<p>

	   Generals complain that top officers get tied up in lengthy human

rights investigations and that the military often must free

guerrilla suspects because they are captured in remote areas where

there are no judicial authorities.

<p>

	   Pastrana faces conflicting pressures to give the military

greater rein in the war while also curbing its human rights abuses

- the latter a condition for receiving military aid from

Washington.

<p>

	   Elected on a peace platform three year ago, one of the

president's legacies may be helping the military gird for war. In

addition to tougher legislation, Pastrana's tenure has brought the

armed forces dozens more combat helicopters, high-tech intelligence

aids and is more than doubling the number of professional troops.

<p>

	   U.N. rights monitors last month objected to seven of the law's

69 provisions, saying they were either unconstitutional or violate

international human rights treaties.

<p>

	   Democrats in the U.S. Congress also raised concerns last month

during hearings about future aid to Colombia. They spoke of

possible aid cutbacks and called for State Department monitoring of

the law's implementation.

<p>

	   Washington' is providing $1.3 billion support for Pastrana's

so-called Plan Colombia, which is aimed at undercutting drug

production and depriving the rebels of millions of dollars they

earn ``taxing'' narcotics production.</p>
