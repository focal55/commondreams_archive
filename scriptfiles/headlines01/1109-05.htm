There's a kind of warning for Americans in the Sept. 11 attacks on the United States, according to University of Georgia ecologist Eugene Odum.

<p>

University of Georgia ecologist Eugene Odum says the United States' use of resources helps widen the gap between rich and poor nations.<br>

</font>''This is a bunch of nasty people, but I think we really know there's more to it than that,'' Odum said in a recent interview. ''This is a wake-up call that we have not really been thinking globally. We have been neglecting two-thirds of the world's countries,'' he said -- the poor ones.

<p>''This is essentially a war of poor against the rich,'' he said.

<p>The United States leads the world in producing pollution and uses a disproportionate amount of world resources each year, Odum said.

<p>With less than 5 percent of the world's population, the United States uses about one-fourth of the oil and other energy resources consumed yearly, according to estimates from the American Association for the Advancement of Science, which publishes the peer-reviewed journal, Science.

<p>There's a flow of wealth from the poor countries to the rich ones, partly because the United States and other rich countries aren't paying the real costs of natural resource consumption, Odum said -- the worldwide costs of emissions produced by burning oil, for example.

<p>''We pay for it (oil), but not very much,'' said Odum, a pioneer in ecosystem ecology.

<p>One positive effect of the events of Sept. 11 is that the United States will now be forced to look at the world economy -- and environment -- in global terms, and not just a ''market system that basically exploits and consumes, and makes some people rich,'' he said.

<p>''The time has come to look at the total Earth and its limitations, and ask ourselves what can we do to make friends with and help people that are not as lucky as we are. We can't continue to do the exploitive economics we've been doing.''

<p>The United States is probably not really ready to do that -- everybody says we've got too many cars and too much traffic, but no one does anything about it, he pointed out.

<p>''It's a fact that we are polluting more than any other country,'' he said. ''We're going to continue to do that until something happens. We won't do (anything) until there's a crisis.''

<p>But ''at least we're thinking about it,'' he said. ''The good thing about this is we are asking all these questions.''

<p>Probably it will take another kind of threat -- an environmental disaster -- to get us moving, said Odum.

<p>''Something will happen to the Earth, something will happen to nature,'' Odum said. ''The danger is we are so close to overpopulation and overuse and destroying our environment.''
