BRUSSELS, Belgium   - Police detained 30 people Wednesday in

a day of protests against President Bush's visit that included a

parachutist with a ''Stop Star Wars'' banner and activists trying

to block his motorcade from entering an airport.<p>

Policemen arrest Greenpeace activists who chained themselves in front of the Melsbroek airport to protest against U.S. President George W. Bush's visit to Brussels, June 13, 2001. President Bush will take part in a North-Atlantic Council at NATO headquarters, as part of his first European tour, and later this week will try to calm European anger over his rejection of the Kyoto agreement on global warming at his first EU-U.S. summit in Gothenburg.

</table></font></font>Two dozen Greenpeace environmental activists chained themselves

together to block a side exit at the military airfield where Bush

arrived from Spain early Wednesday for a NATO summit. His motorcade

left Melsbroek Airport by another exit half a mile away, out of

sight of the demonstrators.<p>

   People on either end were chained to traffic lights and held a

banner reading ''George W. Bush -- Wanted for crimes against the

planet,'' as a loud siren wailed. Dozens of protesters were

handcuffed and taken away.<p>

   Several hundred protesters also gathered close NATO headquarters

decrying Bush's plans for a missile defense shield and his

rejection of the Kyoto global warming agreement. Police estimated

the group at 400 and detained at least two more people there.<p>

   The demonstrators booed and blew whistles as the delegations

arrived for the summit with Bush, with some carrying banners such

as ''Save the climate,'' ''Stop Star Wars'' and ''Death penalty

equals murder.''<p>

   A German Greenpeace activist tried to steer his motor driven

parachute over NATO headquarters and was arrested when he landed

nearby.<p>

   Dan Hindsgaul, a spokesman for the Greenpeace demonstrators,

said they wanted to make their opposition to the Bush policies

heard. ''It's a symbolic action showing he's not welcome,'' he

said, adding that it was the first in a series of protests planned

during Bush's weeklong European trip.<p>

   Hindsgaul said activists from across Europe hoped to pressure

the European leaders not to allow the United States to use key

radar facilities in Britain and Greenland for the missile defense

project.<p>

   In Norway, Greenpeace activists on Wednesday ended an eight-hour

occupation of a U.S.-bound oil tanker rather than face police

action, according to media reports.<p>

   About 10 activists had boarded the Greek-registered supertanker

Cosmic at a Norwegian refinery to protest Bush's environmental

policies.<p>

   Police had ordered the activists to leave for safety reasons and

the group reportedly withdrew because they feared their boats and

other equipment might be seized.About two dozen environmental activists

chained themselves together to block a side exit at the military

airfield where President Bush  arrived for a NATO  summit Wednesday.

<p>Bush's motorcade left Melsbroek Airport by the main exit half a

mile away, out of sight of the demonstration.

<p>One demonstrator was detained by police when he tried to chain

himself to an airport fence.
