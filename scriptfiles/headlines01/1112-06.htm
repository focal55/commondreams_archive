KABUL  - Afghan opposition forces entered the

heart of Kabul on Tuesday in defiance of international pressure

to stay out and there was no sign of the hardline ruling

Taliban after an exodus under the cover of darkness.

<p>``We have taken Kabul,'' shouted one jubilant opposition

fighter as he stood with a group of fellow fighters on a street

in the city center on the 38th day since the start of the U.S.

war.

<p>The Taliban's offices in the city were deserted and some

were being plundered by looters. Residents said some prisoners

had broken out of jails abandoned by the Taliban.

<p>``We have taken key government buildings,'' another

opposition fighter said. ``We are chasing the Taliban to the

west.''

<p>Buoyed by the lightning capture of about 40 percent of the

country over the weekend and more than a month of blistering

U.S. air strikes on the Taliban, the Northern Alliance broke

through Taliban front lines outside Kabul on Monday backed by

U.S. bombing and a fierce artillery barrage.

<p>After darkness fell on Monday, tanks, cars and battered

Japanese pickups packed with Taliban were seen leaving the

capital on the highway leading west and south to the

fundamentalist militia's stronghold of Kandahar.

<p>CONTROVERSY OVER ENTERING CAPITAL

<p>The United States has allied with the Northern Alliance in

fighting the Taliban to punish the militia for harboring Osama

bin Laden, prime suspect in the September 11 hijack attacks on

the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.

<p>But Washington had appealed to the Northern Alliance, made

up mainly of ethnic Tajiks and Uzbeks, not to enter the

capital.

<p>A Pentagon spokesman in Washington said ``we have no

information'' on the reports of the Taliban abandoning Kabul.

<p>The alliance is deeply unpopular among Kabul's mainly

Pashtun population due to power struggles among opposition

leaders in the 1990s that unleashed almost daily rocket attacks

on the city and killed some 50,000 residents.

<p>The United States had wanted a broad agreement on the

structure of any post-Taliban government before the Northern

Alliance entered Kabul.

<p>There have been few signs of progress on such a deal.

<p>



The United Nations says it wants an urgent meeting of

Afghan leaders to discuss the country's political future.

<p>The Northern Alliance had said it would prefer not to enter

Kabul until there was a political deal, but that it may move

its forces into the city if there was a power vacuum.

<p>Opposition Foreign Minister Abdullah Abdullah said on

Monday the Taliban were withdrawing from Kabul but that

Pakistani, Arab and Chechen fighters allied to bin Laden might

stay and fight.

<p>``There has been a significant withdrawal toward Kandahar...

Ministers and high officials have left,'' he said. ``But the

foreigners, the terrorist groups in Kabul are making

preparations for street-to-street fighting. We do not want to

see any more fighting in Kabul. The civilians in Kabul have

suffered enough.''

<p>The capital was taken after a full infantry assault on the

Taliban front line on Monday, backed by Northern Alliance tanks

and mortars. U.S. soldiers were seen in positions near the

front lines, apparently helping to coordinate the attacks.

<p>OPPOSITION SAYS TAKES HERAT

<p>After taking the strategic northern city of Mazar-i-Sharif

on Friday evening, the Northern Alliance has made lightning

gains across the country, taking most of the north and claiming

the capture of the western city of Herat.

<p>Opposition spokesman Ashraf Nadeem said forces of veteran

opposition commander Ismail Khan had taken Herat on Monday and

were marching toward Kandahar, powerbase of Taliban supreme

leader Mullah Mohammad Omar.

<p>But the Taliban said they were still in control of Herat

and were launching a counter-attack in other parts of the

country.

<p>Taliban Foreign Ministry official Aziz Al-Rahman Abdul Ahad

told the Qatar-based al-Jazeera satellite channel that the

Taliban retreat from some areas was a deliberate strategy.

<p>The opposition has yet to try to take on the Taliban in

their ethnic Pashtun strongholds in the south.

<p>But tribal leader Hamid Karzai, on a mission to central and

south Afghanistan to try to persuade local chieftains to back

the return of former monarch Zahir Shah as head of a new

government, said many in the south were ready to abandon the

Taliban.

<p>``We are not planning any military action here. I hope we

can resolve this without war,'' Karzai told Reuters on Monday.

''The civilian population is with us.''</p>
