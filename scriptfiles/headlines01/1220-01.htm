Opinion-makers strongly support the US-led war on terrorism but oppose spreading the action beyond Afghanistan and feel Washington's policies contributed to the September 11 terrorist attacks, according to a survey in 24 countries.

<p>The poll of 275 opinion leaders, published in the Paris-based International Herald Tribune Thursday, showed a majority of non-US respondents felt US policies had played a significant role in fueling terrorists' anger against the United States.</p>

<p>The poll findings suggest "that much of the world views the attacks as a symptom of increasingly bitter polarization between haves and have-nots," the paper said.</p>

<p>"The danger for America is that its overwhelming power is feeding resentment, in the same countries that also feel they are missing out on the spoils of economic progress."</p>

<p>While around six out of ten non-Americans believed Washington was doing the right thing in fighting terrorism, that support tumbled when the question of possible US-led attacks on Iraq, Somalia or elsewhere was raised.</p>

<p>While 50 percent of the Americans polled said the military action should be broadened to the regimes supporting terrorism, only 29 percent outside the US agreed.</p>

<p>Asked if many or most people would consider US policies to be "a major cause" of the September 11 attacks, 58 percent of the non-US respondents said they did, compared to just 18 percent of Americans.</p>

<p>The poll, conducted by the paper and the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press, highlighted a large gap between the way Americans believe they are seen abroad and the way others say they see the United States.</p>

<p>Samuel Wells, associate director of the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, was quoted as saying Americans were relatively unaware of how many Muslims "were terribly upset at the carry-over from the Gulf War," including the continued US military presence in Saudi Arabia and the rest of the Gulf.</p>

<p>Not one American respondent believed the US attacks on Afghanistan would be widely considered as an overreaction, while over 40 percent of non-Americans, and 63 percent in Islamic countries, did.</p>

<p>Andrew Kohut, director of the Pew center, noted as particularly striking the finding that two-thirds or more of respondents in every region outside the United States said it was "good that Americans now know what it's like to be vulnerable".</p>

<p>A total of 52 percent of respondents said the world's wealthiest country does far too little to help the least-advantaged, citing that as a major cause for dislike of the United States.</p>

<p>The paper said the pollsters had interviewed between November 12 and December 13, "275 influential people" in politics, media, business, culture and government; 40 in the United States and 235 in 23 other countries.</p>
