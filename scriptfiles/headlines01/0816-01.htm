            WASHINGTON - The U.S. government is considering walking away from 

            enhanced commitments to halt the dumping of hazardous waste in developing 

            countries, causing alarm among environmentalists . <br>

            <br>

            At issue is a 1995 amendment to the Basel Convention on international 

            shipments of hazardous waste. <br>

            <br>

            A spokesperson for the State Department says that although a decision 

            has not been made, the US administration is considering ratifying 

            only the 1989 convention and not the 1995 amendment, known informally 

            as the 'Basel Ban'. Unlike the treaty, the amendment forbids rich 

            countries from dumping toxic industrial and other waste in poor countries. 

            <br>

            <br>

            U.S.-based groups, however, say that officials told them last month 

            Washington would not sign on to the amendment. This has them worried, 

            because the 1989 Convention sets out to regulate shipments and therefore, 

            in their view, legitimizes dumping. <br>

            <br>

            ''Rather than trying to move in the right direction, the United States 

            is simply trying to move into a treaty in order to move it in the 

            wrong direction,'' they say in a letter delivered last week to the 

            State Department. The groups include the Center for International 

            Environmental Law, Greenpeace, Earthrights International, and Sierra 

            Club. <br>

            <br>

            Unlike similar environmental protection treaties, the 1989 Basel Convention 

            on the Control of Transboundary Movement of Hazardous Wastes and Their 

            Disposal did not outlaw toxic shipments from industrialized countries 

            to developing nations. <br>

            <br>

            When 82 countries added the ban by consensus in 1995, environmentalists 

            claimed this was the beginning of the end of the dumping, which had 

            been shown to endanger the health and environment of people in a number 

            of African, Asian and Latin American countries. <br>

            <br>

            In their letter, the groups say the Basel Ban is one of the ''best 

            opportunities'' to not only halt the toxic flow to the developing 

            world, but also to reduce the toxicity of waste generated in the rich 

            countries themselves. Once the relatively cheap option of dumping 

            is removed, they argue, firms in the industrialized world will have 

            an incentive to clean up the waste in the first place. <br>

            <br>

            The 15-member European Union (EU) has ratified the amendment, as have 

            16 other countries. These include China, Ecuador, Norway, Panama, 

            Sri Lanka, and Trinidad. <br>

            <br>

            The United States has never supported the ban and has sought to have 

            it rejected or weakened, critics say. Although Al Gore, then US vice 

            president, said in 1994 that Washington would seek an international 

            ban on toxic waste exports, pressure from industry has proven more 

            influential in shaping the US position. <br>

            <br>

            ''The United States position on this important moral and environmental 

            question has been dictated by a very small sector of the business 

            community,'' says Jim Puckett, coordinator of the Basel Action Network. 

            <br>

            <br>

            Corporate groups opposed to the ban include the US Chamber of Commerce 

            and the Business Recycling Coalition. <br>

            <br>

            Their case against the ban was laid out in 1998, in a report commissioned 

            by the business-backed International Council on Metals and Environment 

            and prepared by the Center for Trade Policy and Law, both based in 

            Canada. <br>

            <br>

            These detractors assert that the ban violates international trade 

            rules, denying waste importing countries the right to determine their 

            own policies, particularly in cases where the importing country has 

            the capacity to manage the waste in an environmentally sound manner. 

            <br>

            <br>

            ''These countries should be authorized to have access to resources 

            needed to further develop their recycling abilities and their economies,'' 

            says the 1998 report. <br>

            <br>

            Environmental groups, however, say the trade in waste has had disastrous 

            consequences. <br>

            <br>

            In 1988, for example, a cargo ship dumped 4,000 tons of hazardous 

            incinerator ash from the US city of Philadelphia onto a beach outside 

            the Haitian port city of Gonaive. <br>

            <br>

            After having been turned away at ports around the world, the waste 

            that no country wanted ended up in one of the poorest nations in the 

            world, one ill-equipped to handle the ash. <br>

            <br>

            The ash, which contained toxic heavy metals such as lead and cadmium, 

            contaminated the soil in Gonaive, according to the Haitian environmental 

            group COHPEDA. Some of the ash was later taken to the town of Lapierre, 

            where cattle subsequently died. <br>

            <br>

            Several workers hired to transport the toxic materials from the dock 

            also have since died. They had not been provided protective masks, 

            gloves or boots. Many reportedly suffered skin lesions and eyesight 

            problems. <br>

            <br>

            After much pressure from COHPEDA and US environmentalists, the waste 

            was shipped back to the United States last year. As of April, it was 

            still sitting on a barge off the coast of Florida state.
