SYDNEY - The United Nations  on Thursday urged

President Bush  to keep his plans for a missile shield down on

earth and to preserve outer space for peace.

<p>``Hitherto outer space has been militarized we concede but

not weaponized. There has been no placement of weapons in outer

space,'' said U.N. Under-Secretary General for disarmament

affairs Jayantha Dhanapala in an interview.

<p>``I believe it is vitally important that we should preserve

outer space for peaceful purposes and the development of

missile defenses should in no way violate the present

non-weaponized state of outer space,'' Dhanapala told Reuters in

Sydney.

</table></font>Bush has given long-simmering U.S. plans to build a missile

shield new impetus and says Washington intends to opt out of

the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty -- the bedrock of

nuclear stability through the Cold War.

<p>The United States says a missile shield would be aimed at

''rogue'' states such as North Korea and Iraq.

<p>But the plans have alarmed China and Russia and raised

fears even among U.S. allies that it could spark a new arms

race.

<p>Bush's vision of a National Missile Defense  involves a mix

of land- and sea-based and aircraft-borne systems to shoot down

incoming missiles and is likely also to feature some role for

space.

<p>Dhanapala said a commission chartered by Secretary of

Defense Donald Rumsfeld had endorsed a view that the United

States should seek total domination of space, indicating that

could be a future direction of U.S. policy.

<p>SPACE WHIZ MILITARY CHIEF

<p>Bush also this month appointed an expert in computer and

space warfare, General Richard Myers, to head the military

Joint Chiefs of Staff.

<p>The world's nuclear powers agreed in 1967 in the Outer

Space Treaty not to place nuclear weapons in space.

<p>Dhanapala also expressed more general reservations about

the U.S. president's missile defense plans and his intention to

withdraw from the ABM treaty.

<p>While U.N. member states had the freedom to decide on their

own security arrangements, he said any abrogation of the treaty

or multilateral push to build a missile shield could carry an

''enormous cost.''

<p>``It's going to certainly according to the stated intentions

of some countries lead to the production of more missiles,''

Dhanapala said.

<p>``So what we are going to see is perhaps an increase in

tension...we are probably going to see a deterioration in the

international peace and security situation unless of course

there is some kind of collective agreement among the nuclear

weapons states which will help to salvage the present

situation.''

<p>China is already modernizing its relatively small

collection of around 20 intercontinental ballistic missiles.

<p>Dhanapala said Beijing had made it clear to him that that

process would be accelerated if Washington went ahead.

<p>``My discussions with the Chinese, discussions I've had in

Beijing and elsewhere, indicated this,'' he said.

<p>High-ranking U.S. officials have blitzed around the world

to consult other countries over missile defense and to explain

the Bush administration's point of view.

<p>The U.N. disarmament envoy welcomed the consultations,

saying he hoped they led to agreements on disarmament.

<p>He also said he had taken note of a suggestion by Bush that

the United States would be willing to unilaterally slash its

nuclear warheads as part of a missile shield plan.

<p>But Dhanapala said the United Nations preferred

multilateral treaties to unilateral promises for the simple

reason that they were irreversible, and could be verified and

legally enforced.</p>
