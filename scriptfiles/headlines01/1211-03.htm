NEW YORK  - Half of all people infected with the

virus that causes AIDS are aged 15 to 24 years, victims of their

exclusion from prevention strategies and of cultural mores against

discussing sexual matters, according to report released Monday. 

<P>

In effect, many die because of embarrassment, according to the

report, "Youth and HIV/AIDS: Can We Avoid Catastrophe?", published

by the Bloomberg School of Public Health at Johns Hopkins

University. <P>

The document recommends more targeted prevention strategies and

encouraging an atmosphere of open discussion in which young people

feel comfortable asking potentially embarrassing sex-related

questions. <P>

Researchers also assail the United States for stifling discourse

on abortion and sexually transmitted diseases, saying U.S. policy

has hindered access to resources and information in many countries -

with disastrous consequences in places like sub-Saharan Africa,

where an estimated 8 million young people - mostly women - are

infected with HIV. <P>

Underscoring the urgency of the situation, the researchers note

that although 15 to 24 year olds make up only one-fifth of the

world's population, they have accounted for half of the more than

60 million new human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections over

the past two decades. <P>

Some 11.8 million young people are living with HIV/AIDS, compared

with 10.3 million at the end of last year, according to the Joint

United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS. <P>

Youth advocates long have said that AIDS prevention starts with

education in schools, in communities, and among families, peers,

and partners. Young people practice unsafe sex, they say, because

they have little information about safe sex practices and because

they feel intimidated about asking sex-related questions. <P>

"There's a misconception that the youth don't get involved and

would not like to work out their problems," said Jane Norman of

the Washington-based Youth Empowerment Initiative. <P>

"The underlying fact is that young people don't get a lot of

respect and so sometimes they do not act out in the healthiest

way," she said. "Sexuality is a natural and normal part of being a

human being. When we make young people feel guilty, it makes them

less likely to come forward and get information." <P>

Iain Guest of the Washington-based Advocacy Project, which paid

for a group of youth activists to travel to six African countries

last summer to lobby governments and meet other young activists,

said youth should be active in strategies to reduce HIV rates. 

<P>

"Young people, the material shows, are in fact extremely good at

networking and connecting with their peers," Guest said. "We need

to remember that they can be trusted, and their actions are not

dependent on some characteristic behavior but rather on the

social conditions present." 

<P>

The U.S. Policy of denying funding to foreign non-governmental

organizations deemed to perform, facilitate, or provide

information about abortions, has ''hamstrung reproductive health

services abroad that need all the support they can get,'' said

Norman. Even where the ''global gag rule'' does not silence

discourse, she added, it ''censors information by emphasizing the

failure rate of contraceptives.'' 

<P>

The report cites urbanization, more liberal attitudes toward

sexuality, and the breakdown of extended families as factors that

have increased vulnerability to high-risk behavior

<P>

In Bangladesh, surveys found that 96 percent of young women aged

15 to 19, and 88 percent of young men, did not know a single way

to protect themselves against HIV/AIDS. 

<P>

The report also notes that some adult men in parts of Africa

believe - incorrectly - that having sex with a virgin will cure

them of the disease, or that sleeping with young girls will

minimize their chances of contracting HIV. In consequence, women

in some regions contract the disease 10 years earlier than men. 

<P>

Besides young women, high-risk groups include young drug users,

homeless children, sex workers, and the poorest. The report says

prevention strategies targeted at these groups would have the same

impact in reducing AIDS as a national campaign, at 20 percent of

the cost. <P>

Unless immediate action is taken, it warns, life expectancy in

countries including Botswana, Mozambique, Namibia, Swaziland, and

Zimbabwe will fall to around 30 years by 2010. <P>

"It may already be too late to avoid catastrophic numbers of AIDS

deaths,'' said Hopkins researcher Karungari Kiragu. 

<P>

The report urges political and financial institutions to support

youth programs in developing countries. It notes that although

95 percent of people living with AIDS reside in developing

countries, 95 percent of AIDS prevention money is spent in

industrial countries.
