BOGOTA  - The insurgent Revolutionary Armed Forces of

Colombia (FARC), in statements made Wednesday by one of the

guerrilla group's top leaders, rejected their inclusion on the

list of international terrorist groups drawn up by the United

States. 

<P>

   Rebel commander Raúl Reyes said this classification ''forms

part of the campaign the (US) government of George W. Bush has

launched to discredit'' the FARC, and may serve as a pretext for

direct US intervention in Colombia's internal armed conflict. 

<P>

   One cannot compare the Colombian situation, ''based either on

its origins or its characteristics, with what is occurring between

Palestine and Israel, in Afghanistan, in Northern Ireland and in

Spain,'' said Reyes. 

<P>

   The guerrilla leader, who also serves on the three-member panel

for peace dialogue with the Andrés Pastrana government, thus

responded to the decision in Washington to equate the leftist

FARC, which is estimated to have some 15,000 combatants, with

irregular armed groups in other countries.  

<P>

   His statement coincided with Pastrana's departure for the

United States to take part in the United Nations General Assembly

and to meet with Bush. 

<P>

   The list of 30 terrorist groups drawn up by the US State

Department also includes the National Liberation Army (ELN),

Colombia's second insurgent group (with some 5,000 guerrillas),

and the right-wing paramilitary United Self-Defense Forces of

Colombia (AUC), believed to number around 8,000 combatants. 

<P>

   The list has taken on new significance since the Sep 11

terrorist attacks on the United States, particularly in light of

the US-led military strikes against Afghanistan that have been

ongoing since Oct 7. 

<P>

   Local analysts agree that the presence of the three irregular

armed organizations makes Colombia especially vulnerable in the

context of the global war on terrorism declared by the United

States. 

<P>

   Washington's position was reaffirmed by the US ambassador to

Colombia, Anne Patterson, during two public forums held in

October, and she stated that her government will seek the

extradition of guerrillas and paramilitaries who involved with

drug traffickers. 

<P>

   Furthermore, the British ambassador in Bogotá, Thomas Joseph

Duggin, said Tuesday in the capital that both the FARC and the ELN

''are terrorists and have ties with similar international

organizations,'' alluding to the Irish Republican Army (IRA) in

Northern Ireland. 

<P>

   Though he has been careful not to directly characterize the

FARC as terrorists, President Pastrana said Tuesday that

organizations which cultivate terror through car bombs,

massacres, assassinations and kidnappings'' deserve to be referred

to as such. 

<P>

   He appealed to the FARC to take advantage of the opportunity

now in their hands to give new impetus to the peace talks with his

government, negotiations that have reached a critical moment,

according to political observers. 

<P>

   Pastrana added that the Colombian people hope that ''those few

who insist on the armed route... will abandon violent actions

against the civilian population, will break ties with the

insidious drug trade and that they will finally follow the path of

democracy.'' 

<P>

   The peace process with the FARC has been at a standstill since

Oct 17, when the rebels announced new demands for continuing the

dialogue. They came in response to the control measures the

government implemented as a condition for extending the time

period for the demilitarized zone in the Colombian southeast where

the talks are held. 

<P>

   The government beefed up military presence around the

Switzerland-sized area held by the FARC. Pastrana has long been

under pressure from numerous political and civil society groups

that accuse the rebels of using the demilitarized zone to do

business with drug traffickers and hide their kidnap victims, and

of abusing area residents' human rights. 

<P>

   Marco Romero, professor of law and political science at the

state-run National University, said in comments to IPS that the US

declaration categorizing the FARC as a terrorist organization

could have ''very complicated repercussions for the peace

process.'' 

<P>

   ''If the United States is talking about extraditing members of

terrorist groups, it means that at any moment the (Colombian armed

forces) could try to take away a rebel leader just to have results

to show the public,'' he said.  

<P>

   Other experts maintain that Pastrana's appeal is intended as a

wake-up call for the guerrillas to demonstrate greater political

will to move forward with the negotiations that began in 1999. </p>
