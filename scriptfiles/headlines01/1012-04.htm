DUBLIN (Reuters) - United Nations Human Rights Commissioner

Mary Robinson called on Friday for a suspension of air strikes

against Afghanistan in order to provide aid to civilians before

the onset of winter.

<p>

	    Speaking on Irish state radio, she said the situation for

civilians in Afghanistan was ``desperate.''

<p>

	    ``This is the real wish of the humanitarian agencies...the

desperate urgency now is to use this window until about the

15th or 16th of November when the winter snows will prevent

access and the people will freeze and starve to death because

they will have neither food nor shelter,'' she said.

<p>

	    ``We must have a pause in order to enable huge humanitarian

access and to allow a number of Afghans to come across the

borders,'' she said.

<p>

	    The United States carried out a fifth wave of air strikes

overnight in an assault against the hardline Taliban for its

refusal to surrender Saudi-born Osama bin Laden, the prime

suspect in the September 11 attacks on New York and Washington.

<p>

	    Robinson, a former president of Ireland, said there was an

opportunity to save many lives, but time was of the essence.

<p>

	    ``All I can say is there is a desperate situation for

hundreds of thousands -- perhaps up to two million -- of the

Afghan civilian population who desperately need food,'' she

said.

<p>

	    ``It is absolutely wrong that 6,000 people were killed in

the terrible events of September 11 but equally we must have

regard for the population in Afghanistan,'' she added.

<p>

	    Robinson said it was also important that military attacks

be confined to targets that did not put civilians at risk.

<p>

	    Asked whether she was happy that this was the case at

present, she said: ``It's very hard to tell, we don't have much

access.''
