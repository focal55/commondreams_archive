UNITED NATIONS  - A coalition of 1,000 international
non-governmental organisations (NGOs) led by Human Rights Watch,
Amnesty
International and the Women's Caucus for Gender Justice are
expressing
disappointment over the dearth of women judges on the
International
Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY).  
<P>
''Western states are simply paying lip-service to gender main-
streaming,''
William R. Pace, Convenor of the NGO Coalition for an
International Criminal
Court (CICC) told IPS Thursday.  <P>
Only one woman, Florence Ndepele Mwachande Mumba of Zambia, was
among the 25
nominees considered Wednesday by the UN General Assembly at its
95th plenary
meeting in New York. And she was elected last, after four
unsuccessful rounds
of voting in which no candidate received the required 96 votes and
after nine
of her peers had withdrawn their candidacy.  <P>
She joins 13 other colleagues who will begin four year terms as
judges of the
ICTY in November. They are: Claude Jorda (France), Fausto Pocar
(Italy), David
Hunt (Australia), Patrick Robinson (Jamaica), Theodor Meron
(United States),
Carmel Agius (Malta), Wolfgang Schomburg (Germany), Liu Daqun
(China), Richard
May (Britain), Alphonsus Martinus Maria Orie (Netherlands), Ogon
Kwon (South
Korea), Mohammed Shahabuddeen (Guyana) and Mohamed Amin El Abbassi
Elmadi
(Egypt).  <P>
The ICTY was established by the UN Security Council in 1992 to
prosecute
serious violations of international humanitarian law committed in
the
territory of the former Yugoslavia during conflict there in the
1990s.  <P>
But, NGOs are raising concerns that member states are undermining
commitments
they have made to ensure an appropriate gender balance when
nominations for
important positions are made, Pace told IPS.  <P>
''It is appalling that the process is further characterised by the
type of
campaign efforts we have been witnessing over the past few weeks
at the
United Nations, including what amounts to 'horse-trading' between
governments.
This is unacceptable as a means of electing those who will be
the most important judges in international law,'' Pace stressed.  <P>
''Who knows what future candidacies have been promised in exchange
for
yesterday's votes,'' Pace said Thursday. ''Will those 'good old
boys' be
fit to
be the world's most powerful judges?'' he asked.  <P>
''The campaigning that led up to the elections was disgusting -
exemplified by
the absence of any type of gender balance,'' he continued.  <P>
Susan Markham, General Assembly spokeswoman, told reporters that
the 25
nominees for ICTY judges had been submitted by member states, at
the request
of UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan. Furthermore, the Security
Council had to
extend the deadline for nominations to allow for more nominations
to come in
because they had received fewer nominations than the minimum
required by the
original deadline.  <P>
Vahinda Nainar, Executive Director of the Women's Caucus for
Gender Justice
based in New York, emphasised the importance of having women
judges at the
tribunals and at the future International Criminal Court (ICC),
explaining
that ''although women judges at both the ICTY and the
International Criminal
Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) have always been too few in number,
they have been
critical to ensuring that widespread and horrific crimes against
women were
properly charged and prosecuted''.  <P>
In February Thoraya Obaid, Executive Director of the UN Population
Fund
(UNFPA), hailed a verdict handed down by the ICTY where three
individuals
were convicted of crimes against humanity for the rape and
enslavement of
women. The crimes were perpetrated during a 1992-1993 Serb
campaign of terror
to 'cleanse' the Foca area of Bosnia and Herzegovina of Muslims.
The three men
received sentences of 28, 20 and 12 years.  <P>
''The proceedings showed in horrifying detail how countless women
suffered
systematic, unspeakable assaults on their body, soul and
dignity,'' Obaid
lamented.  <P>
''Without women's presence, crimes against women would have likely
gone
unaddressed as has been the case in past international
tribunals,'' Nainar
stressed.  <P>
The first time an international tribunal recognised rape as a
crime against
humanity was in September 1998 when the ICTR convicted Jean-Paul
Akayesu
for rape. It set the precedent that rape could be regarded as an
act of
genocide if committed with genocidal intent.  <P>
CICC was formed in 1995 to advocate for the creation of a fair,
effective and
independent ICC. Since then it has been working with its regional
membership
and governments from around the world to prevent gender biases
from
overwhelming the nomination process for the ICC once the treaty
establishing
the Court comes into force.  <P>
''The processes that characterise the elections for the ICTY and
ICTR will be
the precedents for the ICC elections, we must fight for
transparency and
openness in these processes,'' Pace told IPS.  <P>
The ICC should be established within the next two years according
to the UN,
at which time it will take over the work of the ICTY and ICTR
which were set
up as temporary bodies.  <P>
In the meantime the Security Council has called for 27 additional
judges for
the ICTY in order to prosecute new cases and appeals in a more
timely
fashion.  <P>
Currently the ICTY hears its cases in two chambers at The Hague in
the
Netherlands.
