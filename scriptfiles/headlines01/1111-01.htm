UNITED NATIONS  - Declaring counter-terrorism a

global fight, developing nations warned that world poverty and

desperate living conditions were breeding grounds for

extremists and their followers.

<p>At the same time, Secretary-General Kofi Annan, at the

annual U.N. General Assembly debate among more than 150

presidents, prime ministers and foreign ministers, expressed

apprehension that the fight against terrorism would overshadow

programs to combat poverty, disease, and education.

<p>``The number of people living on less than one dollar a day

has not decreased,'' since the Sept. 11 attacks against the

United States, he said on Saturday. ``

<p>South African President Thabo Mbeki said it was obvious

that the fundamental conflict in the world today is the

deprivation of millions ``co-existing side-by-side with islands

of enormous wealth and prosperity.''

<p>``This necessarily breeds a deep sense of injustice, social

alienation, despair and a willingness to sacrifice their lives

among those who feel they have nothing to loose and everything

to gain,'' he added.

<p>Nine Latin American president spoke, most saying they had

direct experience with terrorists, with Colombia's Andres

Pastrana and Peru's Alejandro Toledo having been victims of

kidnappings themselves.

<p>``Unequal distribution causes frustration and despair ...

and generates the conditions that give rise to conflicts and

clashes where different types of fundamentalism are at work,''

Argentina's President Fernando de la Rua said.

<p>French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine warned wealthy

nations that building up a just global community ``instead of

just talking about it or yearning for it, will mean giving up

privileges, sharing wealth and power in new ways, and rewriting

certain rules hitherto held to be inviolable.''

<p>U.S. President George Bush made his first speech at the

United Nations, and then watched speaker after speaker support

anti-terrorism measures he advocated. ``The time for action has

now arrived,'' he told world leaders from all regions..

<p>The assembly session, known as the ``general debate,'' was

postponed in September after the attacks and condensed into one

week of speeches until Friday. Noting the short distance

between U.N. headquarters and the World Trade Center, Bush said

''many thousands still lie in a tomb of rubble.''

<p>A FEW NATIONS UNEASY

<p>Despite the overwhelming support for counter-terrorism

action, the war in Afghanistan  made a few nations uneasy,

especially neighbors Pakistan and Iran, who supported opposing

Afghan factions over the past decade of civil war.

<p>Iran's President Mohammed Khatami cautioned against

''unilateral practices stemming from pride and rage,'' while

all-important U.S. ally Pakistan advised Washington to develop

an alternate strategy if the military option faltered.

<p>The United States began bombing Afghanistan a month ago in

an attempt to stop its Taliban rulers from protecting al Qaeda

and its leader, Saudi-born extremist Osama bin Laden, which

Washington accuses of planning the Sept. 11 attacks that killed

more than 4,600 people.

<p>The opposition Northern Alliance, with U.S. help has

succeeded in recapturing the northern city of Mazar-i-Sharif,

near the Uzbekistan-Tajikistan border.

<p>Russia, the United States and Afghanistan's neighbors

called on the Northern Alliance on Saturday to respect human

rights in newly captured territory and let in relief workers.

<p>In a statement issued after a meeting of experts in New

York, the so-called six-plus-two group said it welcomed reports

that the Northern Alliance had issued a general amnesty in

Mazar-i-Sharif, which it captured from the Taliban on Friday.

<p>The meeting in New York was between representatives of

Russia, the United States, China, Iran, Pakistan, Tajikistan,

Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. It was attended by the U.N.

special representative for Afghanistan, Lakhdar Brahimi, who is

trying to organize a broad-based Afghan government if the U.S.

campaign overthrows the Taliban.

<p>The human rights concern was well founded, because one of

the key commanders entering Mazar-i-Sharif was Gen. Abdul

Rashid Dostum, renown for human rights abuses when his forces

were in city from 1992-97 and fought on the outskirts of Kabul.

His followers were accused of rape, torture, murder, theft,

thereby paving the way for the Taliban.

<p>Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf, whose country helped

bring the Taliban to power, has been opposed to the Northern

Alliance, also known as the United Front, from taking over

Kabul. Bush after meeting Musharraf late on Saturday said

Washington had discouraged the alliance from entering Kabul.

<p>U.S. officials have long feared a bloodbath in Kabul in

which thousands would die and blame Washington for the carnage.

Fighting between ethnic and political Afghan militia over the

last decade destroyed about a third of the city.
