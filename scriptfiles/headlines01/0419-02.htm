QUEBEC CITY  - A massive banner goes up the front

walls of a tall

office building here, reading: 'SOS - message of resistance

against economic

dictatorship'. 

<P>

Around the corner, the golden arches and the conspicuous yellow

letters of the

fast food chain McDdonalds have been removed by its owners to

conceal the

shop's presence, but the outline of the word still needs to be

washed off. <P>

''This is to keep out the hooligans,'' says a workman as he puts

up a

shield on

the windows of the fourth shop he has worked on Wednesday in this

particular

block.  <P>

</table></font>He is rushing to catch another job ahead of the competition in

what has proven

brisk business here this week - covering shop windows with wooden

sheets to

conceal any signs of corporate globalisation. <P>

The reason: Quebec is the venue of another anti-globalisation

battle this week

when 34 heads of state of all of the nations of the Americas,

except Cuba,

meet

at the Summit of the Americas where they are expected to endorse

negotiations

for the creation of the Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA). <P>

The biggest police presence ever seen in this tiny city of a

little more

than a

half a million people - some 6,000 officers - and a 4.5 kilometre

metal fence

anchored in concrete, tell the tale of a city under siege. By the

end of the

week, some 30,000 people are expected to swarm into this walled

city to oppose

the agreement. <P>

''Instead of fighting poverty, our governments placed a priority

on

negotiating

trade deals,'' notes the Hemispheric Social Alliance (HSA), a 45-

million

strong

civil society network from across the region that is hosting the

People's

Summit, an alternative forum to the Summit of the Americas. <P>

''They believe that free trade and the market will solve the

problem of

underdevelopment ... that globalisation is an irreversible process

that

will be

good for all of us in the long run, yet even the richest countries

are

undergoing cuts to hard-won social welfare services.'' <P>

The reality of the majority of the region's population is best

described by

the

terms unemployment, social exclusion, human rights violations,

destruction of

the environment, discrimination against women, child labour,

illiteracy and

the

dismantling of public services. <P>

HSA argues that the acronym 'FTAA' does not rhyme with

'democracy', neither

does it rhyme with 'sustainable development' and this will be

played out on

the streets of Quebec this week when police and demonstrators who

want the

FTAA

negotiations to be transparent and accountable to the region's 750

million

people converge on the streets of Quebec this weekend.  <P>

The negotiations have thus far been conducted in secrecy, but it

is expected

that the draft text of the agreement will be released here this

week as

government's bow to civic pressure. <P>

Civil society groups are suspicious of a negotiation process that

has so far

only been open to government and business leaders. They have

described the

FTAA

as a way of bringing back the discredited Multilateral Agreement

on Investment

(MAI) and of expanding the North American Free Trade Area (NAFTA)

into the

rest

of Latin America. <P>

''The FTAA is the son of MAI, which in turn is the son of NAFTA,''

says Konrad

Von Moltke of International Institute for Sustainable Development

(IISD).

''Any

new trade agreement that does not promote climate-friendly

investment is

simply

unacceptable.'' <P>

Civil society groups have come a long way since 1994 when NAFTA

was adopted by

Canada, Mexico and the United States. Then, the implications of

Chapter 11 of

the agreement were still too obscure. Chapter 11 is now the

catalyst for

anti-FTAA protests. <P>

It allows corporations to seek private arbitration against

governments and so

far at least 15 known cases have been launched, allowing

contesting parties to

choose who the arbitrating judges would be or whether or not to

allow public

access to the proceedings. <P>

All three governments have been sued. Companies have challenged a

variety of

state actions such as environmental protection policies, and the

damages

sought

have exceeded 18 billion dollars. <P>

In one instance, the Canadian government issued a ban that stopped

a US-based

company, SD Meyers, from importing waste contaminated with PCBs

from Canada

between November 1995 and February 1997. During this brief period,

the United

States opened its borders to PCBs, which are among the most highly

toxic

industrial wastes. <P>

SD Meyers is now demanding damages to cover lost profit during

that period

which could amount to 50 million dollars arguing that the Canadian

government

deprived it of its right to invest in the PCB disposal market in

that country. <P>

Canadian government officials have argued that they were merely

carrying out

their duties under the Basel Convention, an international protocol

which

encourages countries to limit the export of hazardous waste.

Canada does not

permit the disposal of PCBs in landfills while the United States

does. <P>

''While Canadians say yes we have to carry on with free trade with

the rest of

the region, at the same time they are beginning to say we have to

give more

importance to social issues,'' says Henri Masse, a Canadian

national who

chairs

the People's Summit. His government has been the leading proponent

of the

FTAA. <P>

''Perhaps you may think I believe in Santa Claus but I believe we

need to work

out a model that for instance, allows for redistribution of

resources during

times of good economic growth as we have had during the last

decade, that

respects worker rights and that contains environmental provisions.

We cannot

trade away the environment.'' <P>

If it comes into force as envisioned by 2005, the FTAA will become

the world's

biggest free trade area, linking countries that currently produce

11 trillion

dollars' worth of goods and generate 3.4 trillion dollars of world

trade. <P>

''While the FTAA faces many difficulties it also offers a number

of

opportunities,'' Juan Carlos Chavez of PRISMA, a Bolivian

institute that

specialises in international relations and the environment told a

three-day

environmental symposium held here ahead of the Summit of the

Americas. <P>

''An opportunity to conceive a free trade treaty based on

principles like the

promotion of incentive systems aimed at producing goods that are

environmentally safe and produce them in a socially responsible

manner.''
