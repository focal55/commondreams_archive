The US secretary of state, Colin Powell, embraced Washington's traditional role as mediator in the Middle East last night, but left the scope of American ambitions unclear. 

<P>Although Israelis and Palestinians welcomed Mr Powell's decision to send the former marine corps commander, Anthony Zinni, to the region until a ceasefire is in place, they feared the initiative could founder over the secretary's failure to set a deadline for the implementation of a truce, or to spell out clearly his vision for a permanent peace in the Middle East.  

<P>"I think what Mr Powell said today could be the start of a new engagement that could push for a new beginning of the peace process," said Marwan Kanafani, the spokesman for the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat. "But he stopped short of saying the magic words: 'Let's go back and talk now'. He said we should talk but he did not say when and how. There was no meat."  

<P>However, Palestinians took heart in Mr Powell's passionate language against the Israeli occupation, while Israelis praised his call on Mr Arafat to crack down on gunmen and suicide bombers.  

<P>"The occupation of the West Bank and Gaza has been the defining reality of Palestinian lives there for over three decades," Mr Powell said. "The overwhelming majority of Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza have grown up with checkpoints, and raids and indignities. Too often, they have seen their schools shuttered, and their parents humiliated."  

<P>But Mr Powell's sympathy stopped there, and he said the Palestinian revolt had run its course. "Whatever the sources of Palestinian frustration and anger under occupation, the intifada is now mired in a quicksand of self-defeating violence and terror," he said. "The Palestinians need to understand that however legitimate their claims, they can not be heard, let alone addressed, through violence."  

<P>Those statements were seized on by a spokesman for the Israeli prime minister,   Ariel Sharon, as evidence that Washington supports its insistence on seven days of absolute calm in the region before it begins implementing a ceasefire.  

<P>Mr Powell did not directly challenge Mr Sharon's position - which was denounced as "stupidity" by the EU envoy, Javier Solana. Instead, he called for Mr Arafat to make "a 100% effort" to rein in the suicide bombers and gunmen. "There must be real results, not just words and declarations. Terrorists must be stopped before they act. The Palestinian leadership must arrest, prosecute and punish the perpetrators of terrorist acts."  

<P>Israeli analysts said they were struck by Mr Powell's failure to articulate a clear position on implementation of the so-called Mitchell report, which the secretary called the road map for a ceasefire.  

<P>"He reiterated the need for the violence to stop, for settlement building to stop, and for the occupation to end, but one of the difficulties of the Mitchell plan is that it does not make the sequence of implementation clear, and Powell avoided getting into the issues," said Yossi Alpher, an independent strategic analyst. "It is a continuation of the administration's studied avoidance of getting into what it considers to be the pitfalls of Middle East peacemaking."  

<P>Other Israeli analysts saw the sketchy nature of Mr Powell's prescriptions as a sign that Washington had little faith in reaching a comprehensive peace so long as Mr Sharon and Mr Arafat remain in power. Instead, the Bush administration is focused on damage limitation, and on shoring up its alliances with Egypt, Jordan and Saudi Arabia.  

<P>"He believes he can create the momentum that will at least stop the deterioration of friendly forces, mainly Jordan," said Akiva Eldar, the diplomatic analyst for the liberal Ha'Aretz newspaper. "This speech is meant to be more of a brake than an accelerator. It is not meant to speed up the process, but to stop a further escalation of violence."  

<P>He added: "They have lowered the threshold. They are not talking about a comprehensive peace agreement, they are talking about something quite humble."  

<P>However, even cementing a ceasefire after 14 months of bloodshed between Israelis and Palestinians would be quite an undertaking.
