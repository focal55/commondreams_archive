WASHINGTON  - Political maneuvering in the Senate is  

intensifying over U.S. administration plans to drill for oil in  

the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. 

<P>

President George W. Bush and labor organizations are casting the  

issue as important to national security in the wake of last  

month's terrorist attacks. 

<P>

Bush's energy plan - of which the arctic drilling proposal is a  

part, along with increased investment in fossil fuels and nuclear  

energy - aims to reduce U.S. dependence on foreign oil. 

<P>

In early August, the Republican-controlled House of  

Representatives approved a broad energy bill that would allow some  

oil drilling in the refuge, a move strongly opposed by  

environmentalists and most Democrats in the Senate. 

<P>

Last week, Bush urged the Senate to pass his energy strategy and  

open the refuge to oil drilling, casting the legislation as  

important to domestic security. Supported by Republicans in  

Congress, Bush said drilling in Alaska would reduce U.S. reliance  

on Middle East oil. The United States imports 60 percent of its  

daily oil consumption, up from 47 percent a decade ago. 

<P>

''The less dependent we are on foreign sources of crude oil, the  

more secure we are at home,'' said Bush. 

<P>

Organized labor is generally considered aligned with  

Congressional Democrats but its support for drilling in the refuge  

has complicated the already delicate balance of power between  

Senate Democrats and Republicans. 

<P>

The International Brotherhood of Teamsters strongly supports  

drilling in the refuge, arguing this would create hundreds of  

thousands of jobs while reducing energy costs and dependence on  

foreign oil. 

<P>

''In light of the terrorist attacks of September 11, we must act  

immediately to reduce our dependence on oil from politically  

unstable parts of the world, especially the Persian Gulf,'' said  

Jerry Hood, special assistant on energy to Teamsters General  

President James Hoffa. 

<P>

The Teamsters helped push the measure through the House. Drilling  

proponents hope that labor unions will now win over Democratic  

Senators, who are under pressure from environmentalists to vote  

against it. 

<P>

Senator Frank Murkowski, a Republican from Alaska who strongly  

supports drilling in the refuge, has accused Democrats of not  

wanting to raise the bill in committee because they would lose.  

Republican lawmakers, backed by the administration, are pressing  

for a straight majority vote, which Republicans have said they  

would win. 

<P>

In response to Bush, Tom Daschle, the Democratic leader in the  

Senate, has offered to allow a vote on the Senate floor regarding  

drilling in the refuge. His office says he is willing to allow the  

vote because he is confident that Republicans do not have the 60  

votes needed to break an expected Democratic filibuster. 

<P>

While he opposes drilling in the refuge, Daschle says he would  

support construction of a natural gas pipeline from Alaska's North  

Slope. Proponents say this project would produce 400,000 jobs.  

Billions of cubic meters of natural gas accompany the oil  

currently extracted in Alaska but it is reinserted into the ground  

because no pipeline exists to transport it. 

<P>

''If we need to tap into the resources of Alaska, let's do it with  

this pipeline,'' Daschle said Friday. 

<P>

Critics of drilling in the refuge argue that, according to  

government estimates, opening up the preserve to exploitation  

would not yield oil for at least seven years and then yield enough  

for only 140 days. 

<P>

''Giving oil companies a green light to drill a national treasure  

has nothing to do with addressing the crisis at hand,'' says Jamie  

Rappaport Clark, senior vice president for conservation programs  

at the National Wildlife Federation. 

<P>

Established in 1960 by President Dwight Eisenhower, the arctic  

refuge is home to more than 180 species of birds and numerous  

mammals including polar bears, caribou, musk ox, wolves,  

wolverine, moose, arctic and red foxes, black bears, brown bears,  

and the white Dall sheep. Indigenous communities live, hunt, and  

fish on the refuge. 

<P>

Environmentalists argue that even if drilling is allowed in  

Alaska, the Department of Energy projects a 25-30 percent increase  

in U.S. oil imports from the Middle East and Caspian Sea over the  

next 20 years. 

<P>

The public ''should look skeptically at a plan that, in the name  

of addressing terrorism, will lock the United States into an  

increasingly vulnerable fossil fuel and nuclear dependent  

future,'' says John Passacantando, executive director of  

Greenpeace-U.S. 

<P>

More than a hundred environmental organizations are urging  

Senators to consider an alternative energy strategy that aims to  

reduce dependence on imported oil through investments in renewable  

energy sources such as wind, biomass, and solar power. 

<P>

Released by the Washington-based Union of Concerned Scientists  

(UCS) on Monday, the plan, known as the <a href="../news2001/1015-01.htm">''Clean Energy Blueprint''</a>  

already has the support of Senator James Jeffords, an Independent  

from the northeastern state of Vermont who chairs the environment  

committee. 

<P>

The alternative strategy promotes energy efficiency policies and  

the adoption of a federal renewable energy standard that would  

require electric utility companies to increase use of non- 

hydropower renewable sources by 20 percent by the year 2020. 

<P>

''If there is truly a commitment to creating energy security in  

the United States, enacting federal renewable standards will  

reduce the vulnerability of our energy system to disruption,''  

says Alan Nogee, director of the clean energy program at UCS.
