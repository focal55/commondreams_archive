Peace activists in India and Pakistan are urging the governments of the nuclear-armed South Asian neighbors to take urgent steps to avert the prospect of war amid reports of a military build-up along the shared border.

<p>

A series of peace campaigns was launched on both sides of the border this week as fears mounted that an increasingly tense stand-off could lead to a war which the feuding nations have both publicly opposed.

<p>

Among the many organizations that linked up to form a human chain in India's capital New Delhi Tuesday were the People's Union for Civil Liberties (PUCL), the India-Pakistan Soldier Initiative, and the All India Christian Council.

<p>

"The peace campaign is all about forcing the two governments to take all necessary steps to avoid a war," said former PUCL president Rajinder Sachar. "The first thing that the leaders of the two nations can do is stop making provocative statements," he said.

<p>

A joint statement issued at the New Delhi event called on the people of India and Pakistan to speak up for peace. "The silence of the majority is being misinterpreted as a popular endorsement of war-mongering," it said.

<p>

Members of the Citizens' Peace Committee in Islamabad said Pakistani campaigners would stage a series of rallies across the country this coming weekend calling for restraint, combined with firm action against terrorist groups.

<p>

The committee also urged activists to take part in torch-bearing peace marches on both sides of the Atari-Wagah border on December 31. The campaign would press for a de-escalation of tensions through dialogue, it said.

<p>

However, campaigners from both sides stressed that firm action against terrorist groups was necessary for peace in the region.

<p>

Tension has been building between the two nations after a December 13 attack on the Indian Parliament left 14 dead. India claims that Pakistan's spy agency sponsored the attack with the help of two groups--<i>Lashkar-e-Tayyaba</i> and <i>Jaish-e-Mohammed</i>--which are fighting to end Indian rule in Kashmir.

<p>Though the leaders of both countries have spoken out against the prospect of war, military aircraft and troops have been mobilized at the Indo-Pakistan border and there have been widespread reports of missiles being moved into position on both sides.

<p>

The two countries--which have gone to war three times since they became independent nations in 1947--exchanged heavy mortar and machine-gun fire Tuesday.

<p>

Last week, the Indian government recalled its high commissioner from Islamabad and expelled a Pakistani diplomat. It also announced a suspension of cross-border train and bus services.

<p>

"The armed forces of Pakistan and India are standing face to face on the borders, but we need peace, not war," a joint statement by three former leaders of Pakistan, including former Prime Minister Malik Meraj Khalid, said on Saturday.
