UNITED NATIONS  - Future conflicts all over the globe

could be

fought over water, if human beings are not careful with the

precious resource,

UN Secretary General Kofi has warned. 

<P>

''In this new century, water, its sanitation, and its equitable

distribution

pose great social challenges for our world,'' Annan said on the

occasion of

World Water Day 2001 being observed Thursday.  <P>

</table>The difficulties in achieving full access to safe water and

adequate

sanitation

are compounded by increasing competition for scarce water

resources in most

countries of the region, the Economic and Social Commission for

Western Asia

(ESCWA), based in Beirut, Lebanon emphasised.  <P>

''There are many countries that are today in distress when it

comes to water

.... drinking water is going to be a serious problem,'' Annan

stressed.  <P>

More than one billion people lack access to a safe water supply,

according

to a

World Health Organisation (WHO) report released Thursday.  <P>

Forty percent of the human race, some 2.4 billion people, lack

adequate

sanitation and 3.4 million die every year of water-related

diseases, said the

WHO report entitled 'Water for Health - Taking Charge'.  <P>

Polluted water affects the health of 1.2 billion people yearly,

and

contributes

to the death of 15 million children under five, Klaus Toepfer,

Executive

Director of the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) said Thursday.  <P>

Vector-borne diseases, such as malaria, kill another 1.5 to 2.7

million people

per year, with inadequate water management a key cause of such

diseases, said

UNEP's Global Environment Outlook Report 2000.  <P>

''These disease outbreaks create widening circles of misery,

illness and death

with dire economic and social impacts for the people concerned,''

Toepfer

emphasised.  <P>

Annan emphasised that those most affected by water shortages rank

among the

poorest in the world - as well as the least healthy. ''In fact,

the absence

of a safe water supply contributes to an estimated 80 percent of

disease and

death in the developing world,'' Annan stressed.  <P>

''History provides grim reminders that failure to manage our water

resources

properly has caused the end of civilisations,'' Toepfer said,

pointing to the

fall of the Mesopotamian civilisation in what is now Iraq and Iran

and the

Aksum empire in what is modern Ethiopia.  <P>

''If we solve every other problem in the Middle East but do not

satisfactorily

solve the water problem, our region will explode,'' the late

Israeli Prime

Minister Yitzhak Rabin, a water engineer once said.  <P>

Indeed Israeli officials recently raised the spectre of a 'water

war' with

Lebanon as Lebanese villages prepare to pump water from the

Hasbani River

which

flows through both countries.  <P>

''Nobody heard me say wars break out over water, but factually

that is

correct,'' Avigdor Lieberman, Israel's hardline minister for

infrastructure

told The Financial Times, hinting at the prospect of military

action if

Lebanon

began pumping Hasbani water.  <P>

Syria and Iraq embrace the cause of Kurdish guerrilla leader

Abdullah

Ocalan in

the bloody rebellion he set in motion against Turkish rule as a

way of

applying

pressure on Turkey to release more water into the Tigris and

Euphrates Rivers

which are held back by a series of dams in Turkey's southeastern

provinces.  <P>

Ocalan was given money, arms and political cover though both Syria

and Iraq

have fiercely repressed their own Kurdish populations.  <P>

Stressing that water is a ''major security issue'' ESCWA

emphasised Thursday

that ''water scarcity continues to be and will remain through the

near future

a leading concern for all water consuming sectors''.  <P>

Seven of the 13 ESCWA member states are among the world's poorest

countries in

water - with per capita water shares of less than 500 cubic metres

per year.  <P>

According to ESCWA, though progress has been made in urban areas,

rural

communities are still inadequately served, in terms of both

quantity and

quality of drinking water as well as sanitation facilities.  <P>

In some ESCWA countries - including Iraq and Syria - less than 50

percent of

the rural population has safe drinking water and less than 20

percent have

adequate sanitation.  <P>

''Countries that control water are likely to be the big winners of

the

future,'' former US Senator Paul Simon wrote in a new book

entitled 'Tapped

Out', which examines global water problems. ''The world's

population will

double in the next 40 to 90 years, Simon said, ''our water supply,

however, is

constant''.  <P>

ESCWA reiterating the UN Secretary-General's Millennium Report

urged member

states Thursday to renew their commitments to reduce by half,

between now and

2015, the proportion of people who lack sustainable access to

adequate sources

of affordable and safe water.  <P>

''Safe, clean water for drinking and sanitation is simply the

fundamental

condition for bettering the human lot,'' Koichiro Matsuura,

Director

General of

the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation pointed

out.
