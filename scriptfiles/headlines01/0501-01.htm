The Bush administration is expected to nominate an old-fashioned policy hawk as the country's new "drugs tsar" despite debate on the effectiveness of America's war on drugs.

<p>John Walters, a political conservative who believes drugs are a moral issue and have nothing to do with health or social policy, is likely to have his nomination as head of the Office of National Drug Control Policy confirmed in days. With it could come a raft of initiatives favouring punishment over treatment at home and military intervention against the drug cartels of Latin America.</p>

<p>The selection of Mr Walters coincides with several other indications that President George Bush intends to take a tough line against drug-users, throwing ever more of them into jail and refusing to fund state-sponsored treatment centres.</p>

<p>In recent weeks, the Department of Education has announced it will investigate the drug backgrounds of students seeking government loans. Congress has also discussed increasing criminal penalties for using ecstasy.</p>

<p>The new hardline stance in Washington is dismaying drug reform activists, many of whom had seen signs of change when Mr Bush gave a television interview in January promising to take another look at mandatory minimum sentences imposed on first-time drug offenders. They were also cautiously optimistic about Tommy Thompson's appointment as Secretary of Health and Human Services, since he has spoken out against excessive incarceration of addicts and, as Governor of Wisconsin, sponsored needle-exchange programmes for addicts.</p>

<p>That optimism has now all but evaporated. Ethan Nadelmann, director of the Lindesmith Center, a leading drug-reform group based in New York, said: "We've seen one step forward on mandatory minimums, but three or four steps back on other issues."</p>

<p>The reformers also point to expensive military operations such as the $1.3bn (&#163;900m) Plan Colombia as a dangerous waste of money. Many were indignant when a US missionary plane was accidentally shot down over Peru last month, killing a mother and her seven-year-old daughter, because a surveillance plane mistook it for an airborne drug consignment. "Killing innocent people is not an acceptable price to pay on behalf of a strategy that has failed," Mr Nadelmann said.</p>

<p>Mr Walters has spent most of the past decade in the drug control office. Although it is not yet clear whether his post will retain cabinet rank, he will control an annual budget of $22bn (&#163;15bn), covering everything from military hardware to law enforcement on the Mexican border.</p>

<p>The hardline is also striking in light of the questions over Mr Bush's own possible drug use as a young man. During the presidential campaign, he refused to answer questions about cocaine use in his youth.</p>

<p>Mr Nadelmann said: "It is hard to believe that some of the younger senior staff in the administration do not have some past experience with marijuana and other substances." </p>
