WASHINGTON   - The Bush administration warned Saturday that

the leftist Sandinista party in Nicaragua, which hopes to return to

power in elections next month, has maintained ties over the years

with Iraq and Libya.

<p>

	   It was the second time in three days that the administration

sought to link the Sandinistas to international terrorism.

<p>

	   In addition to Iraq and Libya, both listed by the administration

as terrorist countries, the Sandanistas also have maintained

contact with the leftist FARC rebels in Colombia and the ETA

separatist movement in Spain, State Department spokeswoman Eliza

Koch said.

<p>

	   Both groups are on the State Department's list of foreign

terrorist organizations.

</table></font>The Sandinistas, who ruled Nicaragua from 1979 to 1990, are

seeking a comeback in elections on Nov. 4. Sandinista presidential

candidate Daniel Ortega is running neck-and-neck with conservative

candidate Enrique Bolanos, according to polls.

<p>

	   The U.S. statements suggest the Sandinistas cannot be counted on

to support the international anti-terrorism coalition the

administration has been attempting to forge since the Sept. 11

attacks in New York and Washington.

<p>

	   ``As we stated previously there is no middle ground between

those who oppose terrorism and those who support it,'' Koch said.

<p>

	   Secretary of State Colin Powell discussed the Nicaraguan

elections with Foreign Minister Francisco Aguirre on Thursday.

<p>

	   Afterward, State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said the

United States has ``serious concerns about the Sandinistas' history

... of confiscating properties without compensation, destroying the

economy and maintaining links with those who support terrorism.''

<p>

	   The Sandinistas insist the party has abandoned the socialist

policies and anti-American rhetoric of the past.

<p>

	   Koch's statement Saturday indicated the administration has

doubts about the claims of moderation.

<p>

	   She singled out the continuing presence in the Sandinista inner

circle of three reputed hardliners - Tomas Borge, Lenin Cerna and

Alvaro Baltodano.

<p>

	   All three, she said, ``have long histories of grossly violating

civil and human rights and suppressing democratic activities.''

Borge served Ortega as interior minister during the years of

Sandinista rule.

<p>

	   Koch said the United States will respect the outcome of a free

and fair election in Nicaragua.

<p>

	   She added: ``Nicaragua deserves the best possible stewardship of

their country at a time when it faces difficult economic challanges

and when the world is confronting an unprecedented threat to

freedom and security.''

<p>

	   Between 1979 and 1990, Ortega headed a pro-Cuban and pro-Soviet

government in Nicaragua. The Reagan administration sought to

counter the Sandinistas by training and financing an an

anti-communist rebel army. Ortega surrendered power after losing

presidential elections in 1990.
