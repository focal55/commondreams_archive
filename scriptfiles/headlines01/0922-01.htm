The brother of a British victim of the World Trade Center attack warned yesterday against the consequences of killing &quot;hundreds of innocent Afghans&quot;.

<p>Rupert Eales-White said his brother, Gavin Cushny, had been an opponent of American foreign policy in the Middle East.</p>

<p>Mr Cushny, 47, a computer consultant for Cantor Fitzgerald, worked on the 104th floor of the north tower and remains missing feared dead.</p>

<p>Mr Eales-White said: &quot;The ironic thing is, my brother was actually a strong opponent of American foreign policy, particularly in Israel. He sympathized with Palestinians who he felt had been treated unfairly since the state of Israel was created in 1948.</p>

<p>&quot;We don't want the terrorists to win and the perpetrators have to be caught. But if military action results in the deaths of innocent Afghans then 100 more [Osama] bin Ladens will rise from the grave.&quot;</p>

<p>Addressing Congress on Thursday night, President George Bush said 80 nations, including Britain, had lost citizens. Among those feared dead are dozens of Pakistanis, more than 130 Israelis, 250 Indians and men and women from El Salvador, Iran, Mexico and Japan.</p>

<p>About 250 of the 6,333 people missing feared dead at the World Trade Center are from Britain, and an identification team from London arrived in New York yesterday. The group will observe identification procedures in the hope of speeding up formalities in the UK, so that families can make funeral arrangements as soon as possible.</p>

<p>The name of Stephen Lawn was added yesterday to the list of British people missing feared dead. Mr Lawn, 29, from Broadstairs, Kent, moved to New York three years ago. He worked as a dealer on the 91st floor of the south tower. </p>
