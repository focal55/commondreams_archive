            TAIPEI, TAIWAN -- This island nation has long been famed for its transformation 

            from a developing country to an industrial colossus. 

            <P>But a recent labor dispute at a Taiwanese-owned textile factory 

              in impoverished Nicaragua has cast a spotlight on what U.S. activists 

              say is Taiwan's least admired export: labor rights abuses. 

            <P>In recent years, Taiwan has set up scores of garment factories 

              in Central America to produce goods for the U.S. market. Management 

              practices at these factories often seem like they're taken from 

              the pages of a Dickens novel, activists say. 

            <P>"Taiwanese manufacturers have one of the worst reputations in the 

              world regarding the treatment of workers. They can be quite vicious," 

              said Charles Kernaghan, executive director of the National Labor 

              Committee, based in New York. 

            <P>Kernaghan and others say the abuses include obligatory overtime, 

              physical violence, union busting and pregnancy tests as a condition 

              for employment. 

            <P>To be sure, Taiwanese firms are following in the footsteps of many 

              U.S.- owned maquiladoras, which also take advantage of low wages, 

              tax breaks and lax government enforcement of labor and environmental 

              laws. But U.S. factories tend to be less abusive because they are 

              under constant scrutiny by nongovernmental organizations and liberal 

              politicians at home. In Taiwan, there is little public awareness 

              of the problem. 

            <P>"There are civil society groups that are attempting to impose an 

              enforcement mechanism," said Teresa Casertano, field representative 

              for Central America for the AFL-CIO Solidarity Center in Washington, 

              D.C. "But the Taiwanese government is not sensitive to that." 

            <P>Taiwan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs is steadfast in its support 

              of its overseas investors and rejects the implication that Taiwanese 

              businesspeople have a poor labor rights record. Instead, ministry 

              officials say the nation's policy to win diplomatic support abroad 

              has only benefits. 

            <P>"(Our companies) bring much-needed jobs and economic development 

              to these countries," said spokeswoman Katherine Chang. 

            <P>In recent months, the U.S. anti-sweatshop movement has made the 

              Nien Hsing Textile Co., the world's largest manufacturer of blue 

              jeans, a cause celebre. The Taipei company has enjoyed spiraling 

              profits from its denim operations in Central America, which supply 

              the huge retail demand in the United States for cheaply produced 

              clothes. 

            <P>But a decision by Nien Hsing executives last year to fire and sue 

              union leaders at its Chentex plant in Managua who had demanded better 

              pay and working conditions attracted the attention of the National 

              Labor Committee. The NLC is renowned for exposing sweatshop conditions 

              in the Honduran factory that produced clothes for the label of television 

              personality Kathie Lee Gifford. 

            <P>Chentex workers alleged that beyond union busting, the company 

              paid subsistence wages of $60 a month, or 20 cents for every $30 

              pair of jeans delivered to such major retailers as J.C. Penney, 

              Target, Sears, Kmart and Wal- Mart as well as the U.S. armed forces, 

              which sold Chentex-made jeans in stores on military bases nationwide. 

            <P>A conflict began after workers asked for an 8-cent hourly wage 

              raise and complained about poor ventilation, limited bathroom breaks 

              and physical abuse when they didn't meet production quotas. Management 

              then fired four union leaders and 700 others affiliated with the 

              union. 

            <P>Afterward, protests erupted in the United States at college campuses, 

              and action was demanded in Congress, where Rep. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, 

              wrote a letter to then-President Bill Clinton signed by 68 Democrats 

              asking him to order the U.S. Embassy in Managua to investigate and 

              "not be part of the sweatshop economy." 

            <P>The pressure tactics worked. Nien Hsing lost orders from its U.S. 

              buyers, and the U.S. government sent a strong warning to Nicaragua 

              to enforce labor laws that Chentex had violated or lose preferential 

              trade benefits. 

            <P>In May, Nien Hsing received a final humiliation: Nicaragua's highest 

              court demanded the immediate reinstatement of the fired employees. 

              It was the first time a Central American maquiladora had been ordered 

              to reinstate fired union workers. 

            <P>Most important, the campaign against Chentex marked the first time 

              that a Taiwanese firm had been held accountable for its actions 

              abroad, says Chen Hsin-hsing, assistant professor in labor studies 

              at the Shih Hsin University in Taipei. 

            <P>"We hope it shows our industrialists that there is a minimum standard 

              of how you treat workers," said Chen. "It is a lesson they need 

              to learn." 

            <P>Terry Collingsworth, executive director of the International Labor 

              Rights Fund in Washington, D.C., says Taiwanese management needs 

              to learn another lesson. "They bring over a paternalistic attitude 

              and tend not to speak Spanish," he said. "It's a real cultural barrier 

              in which they don't know each other." 

            <P>Chen also hopes the Chentex case will send a clear message to the 

              Taiwanese government. 

            <P>In its desperate campaign to regain admission to the United Nations 

              and resist mainland China's attempts to strip the island of international 

              recognition, successive governments have offered impoverished nations 

              such as Nicaragua millions of dollars in aid and substantial business 

              investments in return for diplomatic recognition. 

            <P>The seven Central American nations are a rare stronghold of support 

              for Taiwan and are among only 29 around the world that maintain 

              diplomatic ties with Taiwan. 

            <P>Since 1992, Taiwan has given the region more than $180 million 

              in aid, including $14 million to build Nicaragua's presidential 

              palace and its foreign ministry. 

            <P>"Development, aid, investment. It's the Holy Trinity of Taiwan 

              diplomacy," said George Nee of the Asia Pacific Labor Update, a 

              labor rights watchdog group in Taiwan. 

            <P>"After encouraging these businesses to go overseas and subsidizing 

              them to do so, the (Taiwanese) government is hardly going to turn 

              around and slap them on the hand for exploiting labor laws." 

            <P>That view is shared by Nien Hsing vice chairman John Chen, who 

              says his company remains one of the largest investors in Central 

              America -- employing more than 13,000 people in Nicaragua alone. 

              He dismissed U.S. labor activists who criticize Taiwanese as puppets 

              of those who want to protect U.S. business interests. 

            <P>"They spread vicious lies and rumors about Taiwan's offshore manufacturers 

              in an attempt to protect American-made goods," he said. "That is 

              their motivation." 

            <P>But some Taiwanese politicians disagree. 

            <P>Independent legislator Shih Ming-teh, a senior member on the parliamentary 

              committee for foreign affairs, is organizing a hearing next month 

              to rally support for legislation that would hold companies more 

              accountable for labor abuses committed locally and abroad. 

            <P>He says Taiwan will pay dearly for ignoring a call-to-arms from 

              Western critics who perceive the globalized economy as unfettered 

              exploitation of developing countries. 

            <P>"In the long run, this will shame Taiwan's international image 

              and will cause a lot of trouble," he said. "This is not an issue 

              that will go away. It's time to take action or pay the price."
