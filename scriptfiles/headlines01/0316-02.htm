Environmental groups and some lawmakers eager to get international global warming talks back on track said yesterday that President Bush's abandonment of a campaign pledge to curtail power plants' carbon dioxide emissions has hurt the chances for a deal this summer.

Bush's decision, revealed in a letter to Senate Republicans on Tuesday, has provoked dismay in Europe. Green parties exercise growing clout there, and resentment is building against the United States' reluctance to engage in an international effort to combat global warming.
<p> "This letter was a real poke in the eye to the European Union," said Kalee Kreider, global warming director of the National Environmental Trust. "This letter sounds like they want to walk."</p>
    <p> Rep. Sherwood L. Boehlert (R-N.Y.), an influential moderate allied with environmentalists, added, "I don't think that will enhance the prospects for productive negotiations."</p>
    <p> Talks on how to comply with a protocol negotiated in Kyoto, Japan, in 1997 that prescribes sharp cuts in emissions of carbon dioxide -- a gas that scientists say is a major factor in the planet's rising temperatures -- collapsed in November. European governments have since pointed out that the United States is responsible for 25 percent of carbon dioxide emissions while representing 4 percent of the world's population.</p>
    <p> Many U.S. allies in Europe had feared that a Republican administration would be tempted to backslide on the global warming issue. But EU officials said they were pleasantly surprised at a meeting of environmental ministers of the Group of Eight nations in Trieste, Italy, two weeks ago when Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Christine Todd Whitman told her counterparts that Bush intended to set "mandatory reduction targets" for several pollutants, including carbon dioxide.</p>
    <p> "She made it clear that the U.S. government recognized the problem and was willing to act," a senior EU official said. "We all believed that this was a good omen for the next round of negotiations and that we actually might get an agreement on how to put Kyoto into effect." Those talks are scheduled to take place in Bonn in July.</p>
    <p> Bush's letter announcing he was reversing his position came in response to a pressure campaign from four congressional Republicans -- led by Sens. Chuck Hagel (Neb.) and Larry E. Craig (Idaho) -- and lobbyists from the coal and oil industries and some utilities.</p>
    <p> Representatives of those industries argued that efforts to curtail carbon dioxide will be expensive and burdensome for the U.S. economy and are counter to the administration's goal of increasing domestic energy production.</p>
    <p> "Obviously, the administration noticed there was a lot of concern" among industry leaders, said Glenn F. Kelly, executive director of the Global Climate Coalition, which represents oil and coal producers.</p>
    <p> "The administration saw the need to clarify the inconsistencies in the campaign document" that called for increased energy production while clamping down on carbon emissions.</p>
    <p> The president's decision undercut Whitman's efforts in the past month to assume a leading role in future talks with European leaders over climate change issues, many experts agree.</p>
    <p> Whitman has declined to comment publicly about Bush's decision. EPA officials said she had relied on Bush's campaign statements when she assured the G-8 environmental ministers of the president's support for limiting greenhouse gases.</p>
    <p> "Christie Whitman didn't say to herself, 'I think I'll come up with a four-pollutant position and see if it will fly,' " an EPA official said. "She thought it [the president's campaign pledge to reduce carbon emissions] was a good hook for her trip to Trieste."</p>
    <p> Margot Wallstrom, the EU environment commissioner, said she was "concerned" about Bush's contention that more research was needed into the causes of climate change before governments could decide on the best solutions.</p>
    <p> She said the latest United Nations studies produced strong evidence that global temperatures could rise as much as nine degrees in the next century, exacerbating the threat of violent storms and the inundation of coastal areas.</p>
    <p> "The intergovernmental panel on climate change has once again confirmed the evidence on the causes of climate change and the solutions," Wallstrom said. "Nobody should ignore these warnings."</p>
    <p> Rainer Hinrichs-Rahlwes, the German environmental minister, told reporters that "maybe it will be necessary to ratify the [Kyoto] protocol without the U.S. and to instead pave the way for them to join later." The Japanese are also likely to voice their concern early next week, according to environmentalists following the issue.</p>
    <p> White House and State Department officials said it was premature to speculate on the impact of Bush's decision until the administration completes a review of global warming policies.</p>
    <p> "Our message to other parties, and that includes European countries, is they shouldn't make any assumptions about our policy until our review is complete," said Philip Reeker, a State Department spokesman.</p>
    <p> "The president's letter does address our long-standing concerns about the Kyoto protocol . . . but the president has said he expects the administration will be active in terms of global climate change."</p>
