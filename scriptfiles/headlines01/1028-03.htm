KABUL  - A U.S. bomb flattened a flimsy mud-brick

home in Kabul Sunday blowing apart seven children as they ate

breakfast with their father.

</table></font>The blast shattered a neighbor's house killing another two

children in one of the most gruesome scenes of Washington's

three-week-old bombing of the Afghan capital.

<p>U.S. bombers killed a total of 12 civilians in two early

morning raids on the city.

<p>Two civilians were also killed when U.S. planes mistakenly

bombed a village north of Kabul in territory controlled by the

opposition Northern Alliance Saturday, residents said.

<p>The bombing has outraged many Muslims. In neighboring

Muslim Pakistan masked gunmen killed up to 15 Christians and a

policeman who was guarding their church Sunday.

<p>In Kabul, the sounds of grief echoed down shattered alleys.

<p>``What shall I do now? Look at their savagery,'' wailed the

wife of Gul Ahmad as the bodies of her children were pulled

from the smoldering wreckage of her home and wrapped in

shrouds.

<p>``They killed all of my children and husband,'' she said.

<p>``The whole world is responsible for this tragedy. Why are

they not taking any decision to stop this?'' she asked.

<p>Sobs racked the body of a middle-aged man as he cradled the

head of his baby, its dust-covered body dressed only in a blue

diaper, lying beside the bodies of three other children, their

colorful clothes layered with debris from their shattered

homes.

<p>The U.S. attacks were launched on October 7 against

Afghanistan's ruling Taliban in retaliation for sheltering

Osama bin Laden, the suspected mastermind behind the September

11 attacks on the United States that killed some 5,000.

<p>BOMBS HIT BUS, OPPOSITION VILLAGE

<p>The houses were in a residential area called Qalaye Khatir

near a hill where the hard-line Taliban militia had placed an

anti-aircraft gun.

<p>Men digging graves for the children were angry.

<p>``Your filming makes no difference. Nobody runs it. Just get

lost,'' one said to a Reuters reporter.

<p>Two other civilians died when a bomb hit the minibus in

which they were attempting to flee Kabul with their family.

<p>Two villagers were killed and 10 people injured when U.S.

warplanes mistakenly bombed the tiny hamlet of Ghanikhel in

territory held by the opposition Northern Alliance near their

frontline positions facing the Taliban Saturday.

<p>The blast turned the mood in the village against the United

States.

<p>``The Americans come here, drop their bombs on Afghanistan

and kill innocent people,'' an Afghan cleric, Kamaruddin, said

at the funeral of one victim Sunday.

<p>``We cannot condone this, although we ourselves are guilty,''

Kamaruddin shouted, as 100 men crouched in the morning sun in

the bleak cemetery just outside the village.

<p>



``We were the ones to invite them here.''

<p>The United States and its allies have been attacking

Taliban positions north of Kabul for a week, dropping powerful

explosives from high in the sky to avoid the Taliban's meager

air defenses.

<p>The Taliban say hundreds of Afghan civilians have been

killed by stray U.S. bombs or missiles. U.S. officials call the

figure exaggerated.

<p>Opposition foreign minister Abdullah Abdullah, while

refusing to confirm the presence of U.S. soldiers in the area,

said the opposition was trying to work more closely with the

United States to avoid mistakes.

<p>Asked if coordination had improved Abdullah told reporters

in Jabal-us-Saraj: ``I shouldn't say that there is a

breakthrough in that but we are trying to improve it.''

<p>Taliban Education Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi said attacks

north of Kabul were intense.

<p>``U.S. jets have been very active and during the past 24

hours the bombings have been the worst since the start of the

attacks,'' he told Reuters in Kabul. He stressed that

battlefield losses had been minimal.

<p>But Abdullah Abdullah urged the United States to step up

the bombardment of forward positions, saying the damage to

Taliban frontlines had been formidable.

<p>``Yesterday's damage to the Taliban capacity in the

frontlines was significant,'' he told a news briefing.

<p>``If yesterday's type of bombing becomes the standard, the

objective of the eradication of terrorism and the war against

terror as a whole could be achieved much quicker -- sooner

rather than later.''

<p>But Washington's political campaign to replace the Taliban

with a broad coalition of Afghans took a blow when the Taliban

captured and executed exiled opposition commander Abdul Haq,

who had slipped into Afghanistan to try to persuade Pashtun

tribal leaders to switch allegiance.

<p>Haq is expected to be buried in Afghanistan because the

Taliban have not released his body for burial in Peshawar,

northern Pakistan, where thousands of exiled Afghans paid their

respects to the Haq family Sunday.

<p>DEATH FOR CHRISTIANS

<p>The bombing of civilians is particularly embarrassing for

Muslim countries supporting the United States.

<p>Pakistan's President Pervez Musharraf, under fire at home

from Islamic opponents for dropping support for the Taliban,

has said the bombing must be as short and targeted as possible.

<p>He condemned the killing of the 15 Christians in central

Pakistan, the first such attack.

<p>Christians had expressed fears they could become targets if

unrest broke out over the U.S. bombing.

<p>In a show of support for the isolated Taliban, more than

4,000 Pakistani tribesmen and exiled Afghans gathered six km

(four miles) from the Afghan border in Pakistan's remote

northwestern tribal region, hoping to cross into Afghanistan.

<p>Young and old had come from miles around to volunteer to

fight, using a motley array of weapons from muskets to

machineguns.

<p>``They have sent a delegation for talks to Kandahar to

discuss the arrangements but the people have not yet crossed

into Afghanistan,'' Rehmatullah, a witness said.
