In an effort to improve his network's image with conservative leaders, 

              new CNN chief Walter Isaacson huddled with House and Senate GOP leaders 

              last week to seek advice on how to attract more right-leaning viewers 

              to the sagging network.

<p>

              Isaacson met with Speaker Dennis Hastert (R-Ill.), Senate Minority 

              Leader Trent Lott (R-Miss.), House GOP Conference Chairman J.C. 

              Watts (Okla.), Rep. Rob Portman (R-Ohio) and Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-Neb.) 

              to talk about CNN's image with conservatives and how it can be improved.

<p>Isaacson confirmed that he also reached out to senior White House 

              officials, but he denied that he was seeking counsel on how to boost 

              CNN's ratings with conservative viewers.

<p>

              &quot;I was trying to reach out to a lot of Republicans who feel 

              that CNN has not been as open covering Republicans, and I wanted 

              to hear their concerns,&quot; Isaacson said in an interview Friday.

<p>

              &quot;I definitely did not say, 'How do we attract the conservative 

              viewer?'&quot;said Isaacson, who stressed that his message was, 

              &quot;Let me hear what you think of CNN, and I am here to introduce 

              myself.&quot;

<p>

              To Republicans, Isaacson's presence on Capitol Hill is a sign of 

              weakness and shows how much Fox News Channel, founded just under 

              five years ago, has eroded CNN's lead as the top cable option for 

              political news.

<p>

              But Isaacson, the former editorial director of Time Inc., disputed 

              assertions that he was on a mission to keep up with Fox.

<p>

              &quot;It really doesn't have to do with any other network,&quot; 

              Isaacson said. &quot;It wasn't some programming strategy or our 

              relationship with Fox or anything like that.&quot;

<p>

              Nevertheless, Isaacson's counterpart at Fox, Roger Ailes, gently 

              mocked his competitor's recent swing through Capitol Hill, while 

              admitting it was a clever business move.

<p>

              &quot;I think it is a real sign of progress that after [21] years, 

              CNN has found out that there's more than one point of view,&quot;jibed 

              Ailes.

<p>

              Democrats, on the other hand, weren't pleased by the spectacle of 

              Isaacson courting Republicans.

<p>

              &quot;That is a byzantine thing for the head of a news organization 

              to come up to meet with one political party to ask what can we do 

              or how do we make things better,&quot; groused a senior Democratic 

              Senator.

<p>

              &quot;That's an interesting idea of balance,&quot; a Democratic 

              Senate chairman dryly remarked. &quot;It is totally inappropriate.&quot;

<p>

              Isaacson deflected the criticism by saying that he's planning a 

              September visit to Capitol Hill in which he will &quot;meet with 

              Democrats and more Republicans.&quot;

<p>

              During this trip Isaacson also intends to sit down with one of CNN's 

              most vocal Republican critics, House Majority Whip Tom DeLay (Texas).

<p>

              DeLay, who has lambasted CNN as the &quot;Clinton News Network&quot; 

              and &quot;Communist News Network,&quot; actually suggested a boycott 

              of the network during a recent bicameral GOP leadership gathering. 

              None of the others Republican lawmakers who were in attendance agreed 

              to take part.

<p>

              It also demonstrates to GOP strategists that their unrelenting attacks 

              on the media, in which television and newspaper reporters are accused 

              of being biased against Republicans and conservatives, are beginning 

              to hit home with those who decide what gets aired on the nightly 

              news.

<p>

              &quot;[Isaacson] is panicked that he's losing conservative viewers,&quot; 

              said a top aide to one of the GOP lawmakers who met with Isaacson.

<p>

              &quot;He said, 'Give us some guidance on how to attract conservatives.' 

              He said he 'wanted to change the culture' at CNN. I think he perceived 

              that they have a problem, and they do have a problem.&quot;

<p>

              DeLay has been particularly vocal in his criticism of the Atlanta-based 

              news organization.

<p>

              &quot;DeLay is on a jihad against CNN,&quot; claimed another GOP 

              aide, who said the Texan believes that CNN's coverage of issues 

              clearly favors liberal Democrats over conservative Republicans.

<p>

              In a telephone interview on Friday, DeLay himself said he &quot;won't 

              go on CNN. They have such a liberal bias. It's quite evident to 

              everyone.&quot;

<p>

              Watts, for his part, was muted in his critique of CNN and said that 

              the network has been fair to him in the past, although he also offered 

              high praise for Fox.

<p>

              &quot;Fox is rocking. There's no question of that,&quot; said Watts, 

              who had breakfast with Isaacson last Thursday.

<p>

              &quot;Do I think that [CNN] has a liberal bias? They probably do,&quot; 

              said Watts, who appeared on the network's &quot;Late Edition&quot; 

              program two Sundays ago. &quot;But I am still not willing to concede 

              that venue [to Democrats].&quot;

<p>

              Fox News has cut into CNN's once overwhelming lead in recent months. 

              

<p>

              For example, an average of 140,000 people were watching Fox News 

              at any given time between Jan. 1 and Aug. 1, 2000, according to 

              Nielsen Media Research. During the same time period this year, 282,000 

              people were tuned into Rupert Murdoch's news network.

<p>

              In contrast, 308,000 viewers watched CNN between Jan. 1 and Aug. 

              1, 2000. During the first seven months of 2001, viewership climbed 

              to 321,000. CNN is seen in 82 million homes, while Fox News is available 

              in 67 million homes, according to Nielsen.

<p>

              CNN has also suffered from a series of negative stories in recent 

              years, ranging from recent layoffs of hundreds of employees to the 

              black eye it received for its reporting of Operation Tailwind, a 

              piece about an alleged secret mission by the U.S. Army in Laos during 

              the Vietnam War.
