President-elect Barack Obama's choice for the next U.S. Trade Representa-
tive, former Dallas Mayor Ron Kirk, must fix a broken U.S. trade policy, which has caused
enormous harm to farmers, workers, communities and the environment, according to the
Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy (IATP).<p></p>
Mayor Kirk's public record on U.S. trade policy is thin-particularly for agriculture. "We look
forward to finding out more about Ron Kirk's positions on trade," said IATP President Jim
Harkness. "We hope he recognizes that the push to blindly deregulate trade has failed not
only people in the U.S., but also people around the world. To build a better approach to trade,
we must put people and the environment at the center. Recognizing the importance of basic
human rights is a critical start. A new approach must also recognize that agriculture and food
are unique and should not fall under the same trade rules as tv sets. Countries must have
the policy flexibility to address the current global food crisis. We look forward to working with
him to ensure that more voices, not just big business, are at the table as we develop a more
fair and sustainable approach to trade."<p></p>
Kirk has a number of major tasks ahead of him, including:<p></p>
• Following through on President-elect Obama's campaign pledge to renegotiate the North
American Free Trade Agreement. A commitment to review provisions on the environment
and labor rights are a start. But NAFTA's investment provisions, which empower corpora-
tions over governments, and agriculture rules, which have devastated rural communities and
increased food insecurity, must be renegotiated with a stronger emphasis on human rights
and sustainable development.<p></p>
• An increasing number of bilateral and other free trade agreements reproduce the unfair and
destructive features of NAFTA. The Bush administration expanded bilateral agreements to
include conditions on military cooperation. We must undo the militarization of trade policy.<p></p>
• The recent food crisis has shown that poor countries need to reduce their dependence
on imported food and focus on strengthening their domestic agriculture. U.S. trade policy
shouldn't continue to insist on forcing open markets in basic food crops and instead should
allow developing countries the space to protect their own food security.<p></p>
• The World Trade Organization's Doha Round negotiations are stalled, largely because the
agreement does not fulfill its original mandate: to help poor countries. It's time for a fresh
approach to the multilateral trading system, starting with scrapping the Doha Round and re-
thinking global trade rules to improve the lives of people and support human rights.<p></p>
• The administration must work closely with Congress in the new fair trade climate. U.S. vot-
ers strongly supported fair trade candidates, adding an additional 40 fair trade supporters to
the House and five new fair trade challengers to the Senate. The TRADE Act, sponsored by
Senator Sherrod Brown (D-OH) and Rep. Michael Michaud (D-ME), requires an assessment
of existing trade agreements and helps to chart a new course. <!-- #EndEditable --></font></td>
