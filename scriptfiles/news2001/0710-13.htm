- July 10 - Equal Partners in Faith, a national network of clergy 

and people of faith, reaffirmed their commitment to equality and diversity 

today, stating they are continuing to speak out against Bush's &quot;Charitable 

Choice&quot; Initiative, and encouraging others to do the same.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Opposition to &quot;Charitable Choice&quot; was reaffirmed today in light of an 

article in the Washington Post (July 10, 2001) stating that the nations 

largest charity, the Salvation Army, is flexing its muscles to promote 

Bush's Initiative in return for being allowed to discriminate against gay, 

lesbian, bisexual, and transgender minorities in hiring practices. 

(Currently, 14 states have laws preventing such discrimination, and more 

states and localities are expected to enact such laws in the future).</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to the Post, a Salvation Army document states that the White 

House has made a firm commitment to issue a regulation exempting religious 

charities that receive government funds from local and state laws which 

prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;It is an outrage that the President of the United States would, in the 

name of faith and compassion, cut a deal like this with people who have as 

their stated goal discrimination against other Americans,&quot; said Rev. Meg 

Riley, Co-chair of Equal Partners in Faith. &quot;This just goes to show that 

the real purpose of the President's initiative is to promote discrimination 

and appease those want to discriminate using tax-payer money.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Under the 1964 Civil Rights Act, religious organizations that receive no 

federal money are exempt from civil rights laws. Bush's proposal would 

allow faith-based organizations to discriminate even when they receive 

federal money. The Salvation Army is already receiving government funds 

under 501c3 provisions and regulations, but is currently not exempt from 

state or federal anti-discrimination laws.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Bush's 'Charitable Choice' plan seems to mean that charities have a choice 

who they can discriminative against and do so with government funds,&quot; said 

Laura Montgomery Rutt, EPF Communications Chair. &quot;This is not just 

unconstitutional, it's morally and ethically wrong.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Charitable choice&quot; provisions are currently part of HR 7, the Community 

Solutions Act, which was recently reported out of the House Judiciary 

Committee. A vote on this bill, which the Salvation Army is strongly 

supporting, is expected to occur soon.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;As people of faith, we can not remain silent as the President of the 

United States and America's largest charity collaborate to discriminate 

against American citizens,&quot; stated Leslie Watson, Co-chair and Managing 

Director of EPF. &quot;We will continue to speak out against this ill-conceived 

and unconstitutional initiative, and encourage all others to do the same by 

contacting their legislators and asking them to vote NO on 'Charitable 

Choice'.&quot;</font></p>
