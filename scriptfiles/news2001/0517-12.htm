- May 17 - A federal program that makes public funds available exclusively to religious groups is inconsistent with the law and President George W. Bush's promises about how his &quot;faith-based initiative&quot; will be implemented, according to a national church-state watchdog group.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Americans United for Separation of Church and State research has learned of a U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) program that makes $4 million in grant funds available only to &quot;faith-based&quot; institutions for substance abuse and HIV prevention.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to HHS materials, secular service organizations are not eligible to seek or receive funding under this program.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;This faith-based set-aside is solid evidence from this administration that it is embracing a system of favoritism toward religion,&quot; said the Rev. Barry W. Lynn, executive director of Americans United. &quot;This isn't a level playing field, it's an arena where secular groups aren't even allowed to play.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;This religious quota is not only inconsistent with Bush's promises, it is inconsistent with the Constitution,&quot; Lynn added. &quot;I believe the White House is inviting a lawsuit it is certain to lose.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In March, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, which is part of HHS, announced a multi-million dollar funding opportunity to establish AIDS prevention programs in minority communities. On the application for funds, one program, worth $4 million, was limited to &quot;faith-based organizations&quot; and &quot;youth-serving organizations collaborating with faith-based organizations.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Americans United has written to HHS Secretary Tommy G. Thompson to notify the department of this program's unconstitutionality.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The criteria used to select the grant recipients are not neutral and secular but instead favor religion,&quot; AU's letter said. &quot;The aid is not available on a nondiscriminatory basis to both religious and secular beneficiaries, but it is only available to organizations that are religious themselves or are working with religious organizations.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Bush administration has insisted repeatedly in recent months that it merely wants to allow religious groups to compete with secular organizations for federal grants.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On Jan. 29, for example, Bush unveiled his faith-based initiative at a White House ceremony and said, &quot;Faith-based charities should be able to compete for funding on an equal basis.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">AU's Lynn responded, &quot;There's nothing 'equal' about discriminating against secular service providers. It appears that the rhetoric of the faith-based initiative's supporters doesn't match the reality.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Americans United is a religious liberty watchdog group based in Washington, D.C. Founded in 1947, the organization represents 60,000 members and allied houses of worship in all 50 states.</i></font></p>
