- January 5 - Today, the Sierra Club celebrated President Clinton's

announcement of the final decision on a plan that will protect the last unspoiled areas of our National Forests.  Protecting these pristine areas

completes the largest forest conservation initiative in generations --

protecting millions of acres of wild forests from New Hampshire to

California.

<p>

"Today's announcement is a victory for us all -- for everyone who has ever

walked in a forest, for the millions of us who rely on our national forests

for clean drinking water, and for future generations," said Carl Pope, the

Sierra Club's executive director.  "By safeguarding unspoiled forests from

coast to coast, President Clinton has achieved the greatest land protection

victory in a generation."

<p>

The final plan is an improvement over previous drafts because it provides

real protection to the wild areas of the Tongass National Forest in Alaska,

America's last great temperate rainforest.  The Forest Service also

tightened up a loophole that would have allowed destructive logging in our

wild forests under the guise of stewardship.

<p>

Today's decision marks the end of a multi-year public process that included

more than 600 public meetings and more than one million public comments.

<p>

"Today we congratulate the President for leaving a legacy of wild forests

for all Americans who love to hunt, hike, fish and camp," continued Pope.

"Congratulations are also due to the more than one million people who

influenced this decision by sending a letter or speaking out at the public

meetings."

<p>

With this rule in place, environmentalists will now turn their attention to

defending the plan.  Timber industry allies in Congress have already

launched an effort to overturn this historic rule.  The Sierra Club will

join with other conservationists to fight all attempts to delay or reverse

the plan.  Environmentalists will also work at the local level to ensure

that this plan is fully implemented and that our last wild forests are

fully protected.
