- January 8 - After thirty years of blown deadlines, inadequate plans,

        and broken promises, a coalition of Bay Area community and environmental groups filed suit

        today against the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to enforce Clean Air Act

        requirements needed to meet the national standard for ozone which protects public health.

        The lawsuit was filed this morning in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of

        California by Earthjustice Legal Defense Fund on behalf of Bayview Community Advocates,

        Communities for a Better Environment, the Latino Issues Forum, the Sierra Club, the

        Transportation Solutions Defense and Education Fund, and the Urban Habitat Program. Our

        Children's Earth Foundation has also notified EPA of its intent to sue and will be joining

        this lawsuit shortly.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Over a year ago, the Bay Area Air Quality Management District, the Metropolitan

        Transportation Commission, and the Association of Bay Area Governments prepared an

        Attainment Plan intended to reduce regional air pollution to meet the ozone standard by

        November 15, 2000. The EPA has a mandatory duty under the Clean Air Act to either approve

        or disapprove this Attainment Plan. Despite this clear responsibility, the EPA has failed

        to take any action even though the Attainment Plan has proven wholly incapable of meeting

        the ozone standard. The Clean Air Act requires that if EPA disapproves an Attainment Plan,

        no new highway projects can be added to existing transportation plans until an improved

        Attainment Plan is approved.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The EPA must act now and disapprove the Attainment Plan,&quot; said Deborah

        Reames, attorney for Earthjustice Legal Defense Fund. &quot;For 30 years local agencies

        have made half-hearted efforts that have failed to clean up our air. Local agencies

        develop plans that rely on overly-optimistic estimates of technical fixes to show that the

        ozone standard will be met. But violations just continue, deadlines are blown, and a new

        round of overly optimistic planning begins again. This latest Attainment Plan is simply

        more of the same. If EPA won&#146;t disapprove the Attainment Plan itself, our only option

        is to go to the courts.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Public health demands real and enforceable emissions reductions instead of this

        endless shell game,&quot; said Kathryn Alcantar of the Latino Issues Forum. &quot;Low

        income and minority communities breathe more dirty air than others in our region. When the

        EPA fails to do its job, it&#146;s minorities and the poor that bear disproportionate

        health impacts.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;It&#146;s time for this pattern of junk plans and failure to stop and if it means

        a speed-bump for the highway builders then so be it. Car and truck emissions produce half

        of the air pollution in the Bay Area. Time and money spent moving people by means other

        than the private automobile would improve quality of life for everyone,&quot; added Martha

        Olson with the Urban Habitat Program.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Richard Drury, an attorney for Communities for a Better Environment said, &quot;It's a

        shame that Bay Area communities must bring in federal courts to enforce the Clean Air Act.

        But after 30 years of foot dragging by local agencies and the EPA, it looks like a kick in

        the pants is needed.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Our Children's Earth Foundation's Executive Director Tiffany Schauer stated, &quot;It

        is high time that EPA provided oversight to the Bay Area agencies who are failing to

        comply with the federal Clean Air Act. The diversity of the coalition bringing this

        lawsuit demonstrates its importance to the health of children throughout the Bay

        Area.&quot;</font></p>

<ul>

          

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Ground level ozone is commonly known as smog and is a powerful lung irritant</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The National Ambient Air Quality Standard (&quot;NAAQS&quot;) for ozone is set at 120

            parts per billion to protect public health</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Stricter standards adopted by EPA are now being adjudicated by the U.S. Supreme Court</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At levels above the NAAQS, ozone can cause shortness of breath, chest pain, coughing,

            nausea, and throat irritation</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Chronic exposure to ozone at levels above the NAAQS can result in permanent loss of lung

            function</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Children, the elderly, and those with respiratory diseases such as asthma are most at

            risk</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Up to 20% of all summertime hospital visits for respiratory problems are associated with

            elevated ozone levels, according to the EPA</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">African-Americans are 3 times more likely to die from ozone-related asthma than white

            Americans, according to figures from the public interest group Airkeepers</font></li>

<ul>

          

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">November 15, 2000 is the fourth deadline for attainment of the ozone NAAQS the region

            has missed</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This past summer, the Bay Area recorded readings of 152 and 138 parts per

            billion&#151;27% and 15% above the NAAQS</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Over the past three years, the region has recorded 28 exceedances of the NAAQS</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Roughly half of the pollutants that form ozone come from cars and trucks in the Bay

            Area; the remaining emissions come from refineries, power plants, and fuel and solvent

            evaporation</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Bay Area emissions also get blown eastward into the Central Valley, impacting public

            health there</font></li>

</ul>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>The 1999 Bay Area Ozone Attainment Plan</b></font>

<ul>

          

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 1999 Attainment Plan was intended to bring the region into compliance with the NAAQS

            by the November 15, 2000 deadline; due to the number of exceedances this past summer, the

            Clean Air Act does not allow the EPA to extend the Bay Area&#146;s attainment deadline</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Though the 1999 Attainment Plan was intended to clean up the air so that no more than 3

            exceedances of the NAAQS would occur at any one monitoring station from 1998 through 2000,

            Livermore recorded 10, Concord 5, and San Martin 4 excursions over the NAAQS during this

            period</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The EPA was required by the Act to either approve or disapprove the 1999 Attainment Plan

            by October 28, 2000; this deadline came and went without any EPA action</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This coalition of groups sent a 60-day notice of intent to sue as required by the Act to

            the EPA on October 30, 2000</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">From the number of exceedances this past summer it is clear that the 1999 Attainment

            Plan did not meet the ozone standard and should be disapproved by the EPA </font></li>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If the 1999 Attainment Plan is disapproved, even in part, by the EPA, three consequences

            are triggered: (a) immediately, the region enters a &quot;conformity freeze&quot; meaning

            that no highway projects not already in an approved transportation plan or program can be

            built until an improved Attainment Plan is approved; (b) an eighteen month deadline is set

            for a new Attainment Plan to be approved; (c) an eighteen month sanctions clock begins,

            that, at the end of eighteen months stops all federal highway funding to the region if a

            new Attainment Plan is not approved</font></li>
