- February 5 - Studies have shown that underrepresented minority physicians are

more likely to practice in underserved communities.  At the same time, the number of health professional shortage areas in the U.S. swell, which

contributes to significant racial disparities in health outcomes.  However,

the nation's medical schools are failing to train a physician workforce

reflective of our ever-diversifying population.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This critical issue was brought to the public's attention during last

Thursday's episode of &quot;ER&quot; on NBC, when Eriq La Salle's character, Dr. Peter

Benton, was appointed to a position to improve the recruitment and training

of minority physicians.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The American Medical Student Association (AMSA) is working on the answer to this question about the physician workforce and health disparities.  AMSA's

30,000 physician-in-training members applaud NBC and Warner Brothers (the

show's producer) for focusing attention on this problem of enormous

consequence to the health of millions of Americans.  Founded in 1950, AMSA

is the nation's largest, independent medical student organization.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Medical education institutions have a social obligation to train doctors

that will offer the best health-care services possible to our diversifying

population,&quot; said Sindhu Srinivas, MD, AMSA national president.  Srinivas

continued, &quot;In order to fulfill this, medical schools must recruit a student

body which reflects our nation's changing demographics.  If we fail in this

effort, the divide between the health of the rich and poor, minorities and

Caucasians, urban and suburban, will only continue to expand.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">AMSA has begun a national effort to compile a set of best practices for

medical school admissions.  Schools will complete a detailed survey that

will qualitatively and quantitatively examine their admission processes and

philosophies.  The results of the survey will be presented in a scorecard

that ranks the schools based on a scale determined by a review committee.

The best practices will be highlighted and promoted to each school to foster

positive change.  With this, AMSA believes medical education will undergo

significant and needed reform to better serve our nation.</font></p>
