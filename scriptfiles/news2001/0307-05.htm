- March 7 - On the day Mexican President Vicente Fox announced a new

"National Crusade for the Forests and Water", the Sierra Club and Amnesty

International,USA expressed concern that it will be difficult to encourage

citizen environmentalism when two environmentalists remain in prison and

many continue to face threats and harassment.

<p>

Rodolfo Montiel and Teodoro Cabrera, two farmers and environmental

activists are currently in prison for their efforts to halt the rampant logging in their farming community in the state Guerrero, Mexico.

<p>

"While we are pleased that President Fox is making efforts to improve

environmental protection in Mexico by encouraging citizens to work with the

government, there appears to be a double standard when environmental

activists are sitting in jail for doing what the government is now asking

of its citizens," said Alejandro Queral of Sierra Club's Human Rights and

Environment program.

<p>

Montiel, one of the founding members of the Organización de Campesinos

Ecologistas de la Sierra de Petatlan y Coyuca de Catalan, A.C.

(Organization of Campesino Environmentalists of the Sierra de Petatlan and

Coyuca de Catalan), organized farmers to oppose the rampant and illegal logging in these mountains in Guerrero, Mexico.  Montiel and Cabrera, who

have been named "Prisoners of Conscience" by Amnesty International, have

been imprisoned since May of 1999 when the two men were arrested, beaten

and tortured.

<p>

"If President Fox wants to foster a civil society where citizens feel

comfortable participating, then Montiel and Cabrera should be released

immediately and unconditionally," said Folabi Olagbaju Director of Amnesty

International's Human Rights and the Environment program.

<p>

The case of the two environmentalists has received international attention.

Most recently, the Associated Press reported that President Fox's own

Environment Minister, Victor Lichtinger, visited the men in prison and

wished them "good luck."   The case was also featured in the U.S. State Department's annual report on human rights which noted that Mexico's

National Human Rights Commission "charged that the military falsified

evidence against [the two men], tortured them, violated their rights to due

process, and harassed residents in their home village."

<p>

In February, noted human rights advocate Ethel Kennedy traveled to Mexico

to present Montiel with the Sierra Club's Chico Mendes award for

environmental heroism.

<p>

The concerns of Amnesty International and the Sierra Club have been echoed

by members of Fox's administration.  The Mexican newspaper La Jornada

reported that Rodolfo Lacy, Coordinator of Advisors to the Minister of the

Environment, said, " We commented about 'how are we going to make a call on

society to participate on the national crusade to defend the forests and

water if those that participate are detained?'"  The comment was made on

February 6th at the Sierra Club press conference held in Mexico City to present the Chico Mendes award to Montiel.

<p>

An "amparo" or, special appeal, for Montiel and Cabrera was filed last

week. A decision on the appeal is expected later this month.
