Wade? In the long struggle for women's equality, Roe v. Wade is one of the most important milestones. Roe was a signal that women had achieved a new place within American society, that their reproductive lives, health, and freedom would be respected and honored. Roe was an affirmative statement that personal reproductive health decisions should be made by the individual, not by the government. Roe recognized the freedom to choose as central to women's equality, autonomy, and dignity. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We have gone seven years without a vacancy on the Supreme Court &#151; the longest period in 178 years. President Bush is likely to have the opportunity to replace at least one, if not more, of the justices who continue to uphold Roe's basic principles. He has touted Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas &#151; the Court's two most virulent opponents of Roe &#151; as his model justices. Just one more anti-choice justice could lead to the overturn of Roe and the end of legal abortion in this country. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;On this First Monday, the freedom to choose stands at the brink. NARAL remains committed to protecting that freedom and to ensuring that the right to choose continues to hold its rightful place among the constellation of American constitutional freedoms.&quot; </font></p>
