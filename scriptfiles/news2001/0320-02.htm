<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">LONDON / MANILA 

- March 20 - The International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) has confirmed to Greenpeace that it does not intend to release genetically engineered (GE), so-called 'Golden Rice' into the environment in the near future and that it is likely to take five years even before field trials could be conducted. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">During a visit to the Philippines based institute this week, the 

IRRI scientists told Greenpeace that various genetic elements in 

the 'Golden Rice' need to be changed or removed, in particular 

its gene construct and an antibiotic resistance gene (1-2). The 

institute had received the first grains of this GE rice variety for 

breeding purposes earlier this year. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The IRRI scientists admitted that many uncertainties related to 

the  'Golden Rice' still need to be addressed before this GE 

crop could be released outside of a secure containment. These 

include environmental risks as well as health and nutritional 

questions. </font></p>

<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><p>The IRRI also confirmed that the currently available 'Golden Rice' only produces very low levels of beta-carotene, and that higher amounts of this provitamin A would be needed. They also agreed with Greenpeace that the best solution to vitamin A deficiency is a diverse diet. </P>

 

</font>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Greenpeace welcomed the fact that the world's leading public 

rice research institute is taking a rather cautious approach 

towards the so-called 'Golden Rice'. Greenpeace calls on the 

IRRI to stop wasting time on the GE rice, and instead to focus 

all efforts on developing sustainable solutions to serve public 

health needs rather than the interests of the multinational GE 

companies. The 'Golden Rice' has been heralded as a quick fix 

solution to fight vitamin A deficiency by the GE industry.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"There are cheap and proven solutions and technologies 

available to fight against vitamin A deficiency," said Von 

Hernandez Greenpeace Southeast Asia campaign director. "The 

main problem is lack of political will to see these solutions 

through and the inadequacy of resources to enforce them. The 

GE industry's propaganda that keeps pushing 'Golden Rice' as 

the solution  for vitamin A deficiency is  irresponsible. It is using 

the misery of mothers and children who suffer from this 

deficiency for its own commercial gain."</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When asked by Greenpeace, IRRI scientists admitted that there 

might even be naturally occurring rice varieties that contain beta-

carotene or other vitamin A precursors. However, very few 

studies have been conducted so far, on whether such natural pro-

vitamin rich rice  varieties exist. The IRRI also told Greenpeace 

that the cost of its experiments involving genetic engineering 

represent only 3 percent of its total budget. (3)

<b>Notes:</b>

<p>"Geneconstruct" refers to genetic material or genes incorporated into a genetically modified organism. The IRRI scientists believe that another type of gene construct needs to be used to increase/promote the level of beta-carotene production in the 'Golden Rice'. 

<p>(2)Antibiotic resistance genes are used as a marker to check if the genetic engineering process has worked. The 'Golden Rice'currently still contains a hygromycin antibiotic resistance gene. 

There is broad agreement that these marker genes should be 

phased out because of potential health risks. 

<p>(3)The IRRI has recently initiated a project to search for adequate rice varieties with high vitamin A content. 

<p>Other issues of mutual interest that were discussed between Greenpeace and the IRRI where patents on genes and plant varieties that seriously hamper international public research as well as biological pest control. Greenpeace also criticised other GE projects conducted by the IRRI, such as genetically engineered Bt-rice.
