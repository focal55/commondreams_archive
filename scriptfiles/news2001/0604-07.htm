- June 4 - While many have focused on the specifics of President Bush’s daughter Barbara being charged with underage drinking at an Austin restaurant last week, some specialists in

alcohol policies are urging a shift in public focus -- to scrutinize key roles

of the alcohol industry.

<P>The following policy analysts are available for interviews:</P>



<P><LI>LAURIE LEIBER, <A HREF="mailto:LaurieL@PartnershipPH.org">

LaurieL@PartnershipPH.org</A>, <A HREF="http://www.PartnershipPH.org">www.PartnershipPH.org</A><BR>

Leiber is a member of the California Council on Alcohol Policy. She said today: "President

Bush is asking that we treat his daughters' citations for alcohol-related

violations as a private, family matter. But underage drinking is a very public,

policy matter as long as the alcohol industry is permitted to aggressively

target underage minors with its advertising and promotions.... Holding young

people solely responsible for underage drinking is like blaming fish for dying

in a polluted stream."

Godshall, executive director of SmokeFree Pennsylvania, was featured in a 1999 CBS "60

Minutes" expose of tobacco-industry sponsorship of legislation to penalize

the young. He said today: "By doing little or nothing to reduce the

alcohol industry's rampant advertising and distribution to minors, officials in

Texas and most other states have assisted the booze peddlers in encouraging

President Bush’s daughters and other minors to attempt purchasing alcohol. The

recent alcohol episodes involving President Bush’s daughters highlight the

critical need for elected officials to begin holding the greedy alcohol and

tobacco industries accountable for target marketing their addictive and lethal

products to youth, and to stop scapegoating youth for doing exactly what

industry advertising teaches them is cool, sexy, adventurous and fun. Over the

past few decades, the wealthy alcohol and tobacco industries have aggressively

lobbied for laws that have shifted civil and criminal liability away from

themselves and onto their youthful target markets. This shifting of legal

responsibility from deadly drug pushers to immature youth wasn't intended to

and cannot reduce youth drinking or smoking, but rather it has only scapegoated

youth for the egregious actions of deadly industries."
