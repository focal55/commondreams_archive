- August 22 - The Bush Administration released its revised budget surplus estimates

today.  The Office of Management and Budget projects a non-Social Security

budget surplus of only $1 billion for both fiscal years 2001 and 2002.

That leaves no money for the $18.4 billion Pentagon budget amendment

without cutting domestic programs or tapping the Medicare or Social

Security surplus.  Given that the U.S. has no significant enemies, there is

no justification for raiding popular social programs in order to fund the

already bloated Pentagon.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Raiding these vital programs to fund a Department of Defense that cannot

balance its books and has no significant enemies is absurd, especially when

public opinion polls consistently show that military spending is a low

priority compared to domestic programs,&quot; said Dan Koslofsky, analyst with

the pro-arms control organization Council for a Livable World Education

Fund.  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Even the administration's optimistic budget numbers show that providing the

$18.4 billion Pentagon increase will require tapping either Social Security

or Medicare.  The total increase requested for the 2002 Pentagon budget is

$33 billion (10 percent over 2001) raising total defense spending to over

$343 billion.  That amount of military spending will likely be more than

all the other nations in the world combined and will actually top the

average Pentagon budget during the five decades of Cold War spending.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Language in the budget resolution allows the budget committee chairmen to

increase the cap for defense spending only if it does not tap into the

Social Security and Medicare trust.  Senate Budget Committee Chairman Kent

Conrad (D-ND) said he will &quot;personally oppose&quot; the defense increase.  His

counterpart in the House Rep. Jim Nussle (R-IA) has consistently stated

that he will not touch either trust fund.  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This dynamic sets up a major political battle in which supporters of

increased defense spending will likely try to bypass the committees or seek

cuts in other discretionary domestic programs.  Considering the

Administration's request already cuts funding for the Departments of

Interior, Agriculture, Energy, Justice, Labor and Transportation along with

the EPA and the Federal Emergency Management Agency, additional offsets

will be difficult to find.  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The debate is simple: either freeze defense spending or cut popular

domestic programs,&quot; added Koslofsky.
