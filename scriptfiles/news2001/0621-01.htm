- June 21 - The Indonesia Human Rights Network applauded a lawsuit 

filed yesterday in Washington naming the oil giant ExxonMobil corporation 

as responsible for murder, torture, kidnapping and twelve other charges at 

its liquefied natural gas operations in Aceh, a region on the northern tip 

of Sumatra, Indonesia.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The suit, filed on behalf of eleven Acehnese villagers, claims that 

ExxonMobil hired the Indonesian military to provide security for the 

corporation&sup1;s facilities in Aceh. These troops, under the employ of 

ExxonMobil, committed human rights abuses against the local population.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Troops stationed at the ExxonMobil facilities tortured villagers in 

buildings on ExxonMobil property, according to the filing by the 

International Labor Rights Fund.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;While oil companies and the Indonesian government reap enormous profits, 

the people are suffering at the hands of the very security forces employed 

by ExxonMobil to protect its assets,&quot; said Kurt Biddle, Washington 

Coordinator for the Indonesia Human Rights Network.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ExxonMobil, rated number one in the Fortune 500, temporarily shut down its 

liquefied natural gas extraction facilities in March 2001, citing serious 

security concerns.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Since January 2000, Kontras-Aceh, a local human rights organization, has 

reported more than 670 killings and 161 disappearances in Aceh. The 

Indonesian military and police act without impunity in the resource-rich 

region. Prominent civic leaders and humanitarian workers have been executed.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> From 1989 to 1998, Aceh was declared a Military Operation Area, known by 

the Indonesian acronym DOM. During this period of military rule, human 

rights violations soared as police and military intentionally targeted the 

civilian population as a means to destroy the armed resistance (the Free 

Aceh Movement) fighting for Aceh&sup1;s independence. After the dictator Suharto 

fell from power in 1998, DOM officially ended and investigations into the 

atrocities committed by the Indonesian military began. Human rights 

organizations reported that over 1,300 people were killed during DOM and 

thousands were tortured. At least 12 mass graves were discovered.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Since then, President Abdurrahman Wahid first offered, then withdrew the 

offer to allow a referendum on independence for Aceh. Calls for a 

referendum have mounted in Aceh and in November 1999 over a million people 

gathered in the city of Banda Aceh to demand a referendum. Violence has 

escalated as thousands of Indonesian troops have been sent to the region. 

An estimated 7-10 people are being killed on a daily basis in Aceh now.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The allegations in this lawsuit clearly demonstrate why now is not the 

time for the U.S. to restore ties with the Indonesian military,&quot; said 

Biddle. &quot;The TNI (Indonesian National Military) are on a brutal campaign of 

murdering people in Aceh and across the archipelago.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Prompted by the brutal Indonesia military and militia devastation of East 

Timor after the August 30, 1999 independence vote, the U.S. Congress placed 

a ban on U.S. training and assistance to the Indonesian military.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Human rights groups have long criticized Freeport-McMoRan&#139;another 

U.S.-owned multinational corporation operating in Indonesia&#139;for using the 

Indonesian military to provide security at its mine in West Papua, Indonesia.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A copy of the filing is available at <a href="http://www.laborrights.org" target="new">www.laborrights.org</a>.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Indonesia Human Rights Network (IHRN) is a U.S.-based grassroots 

organization working to educate and activate the American public and 

influence U.S. foreign policy and international economic interests to 

support democracy, demilitarization, and justice through accountability and 

rule of law in Indonesia. We seek to end armed forces repression in 

Indonesia by exposing it to international scrutiny. IHRN works with and 

advocates on behalf of people throughout the Indonesian archipelago to 

strengthen civil society. See www.indonesianetwork.org for more information.
