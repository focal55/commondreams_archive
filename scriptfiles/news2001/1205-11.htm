<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - December 5 - President Bush today tapped former Montana Gov. Marc Racicot to

head the Republican National Committee, picking a close friend

and a well-connected Washington lobbyist for the GOP's top

political post.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Racicot, who was on Bush's short list for attorney general, will

replace Virginia Gov. Jim Gilmore, who resigned last week citing

family reasons.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At an Oval Office ceremony today, Bush talked up Racicot as a

team player who will help the GOP tap crucial voting blocks

including labor unions and minorities in the next elections, but

that's not the only experience Racicot brings to the table.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Racicot also happens to be an increasingly prominent Washington

lobbyist. In just under a year, he has signed up a short, but

powerful, roster of clients, including Enron Corp, railroad

giant Burlington Northern Santa Fe and the Recording Industry

Association of America, which retained the former governor in

its copyright fight against Napster.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">One of the obvious keys to Racicot's quick rise in Washington is

his close ties to the White House, an attribute that has

benefited his clients on more than one occasion this year. For

instance, Racicot was among the wave of lobbyists who

contributed ideas to the Bush energy policy, and he personally

lobbied Vice President Dick Cheney on the subject of forcing

companies to update their clean air equipment.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">More recently, Racicot pressed Tom Ridge, director of homeland

security, for federal aid for energy companies looking to beef

up security in the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks. In October,

Bush named Racicot as a special U.S. envoy to help broker a

settlement with Canada over a long-running trade dispute over

lumber imports-a subject Racicot likely is very familiar with,

considering that one of his clients is the American Forest &amp;

Paper Association, the trade group representing the timber

industry in Washington.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But in Racicot's case, the past won't exactly be prologue. At

the White House event announcing his appointment, Racicot told

reporters that he will scale back, but not give up, his lobbying

practice in Washington-becoming the first party chairman in

recent memory to openly maintain such duties. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Even Haley Barbour, a Washington lobbyist who helmed the RNC

from 1993-97, officially put his lobbying aside while running

the party. Today, Barbour is one of the most powerful lobbyists

in Washington, with clients including Microsoft, Philip Morris

and several airlines.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It appears the issue of Racicot's lobbying was clearly vetted by

the White House. According to the Associated Press, Racicot and

Karl Rove, President Bush's senior political strategist,

discussed terms of employment in recent days, including whether

Racicot could earn income from outside the RNC while chairman.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Apparently, the answer was yes.</font></p>
