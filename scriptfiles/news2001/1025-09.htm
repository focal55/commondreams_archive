<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON 

- October 25 - Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld's statement today

on national missile defense tests is both encouraging and discouraging,

according to the pro-arms control group Council for a Livable World.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In a statement released today, Council president John Isaacs stated: &quot;The

positive sign is that the administration has sent a signal to the Russians

and the rest of the world that the United States will not violate the 1972

Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;On the negative side,&quot; Isaacs added, &quot;the Administration continues to

insist that the treaty is a significant obstacle to the missile defense

program and that it must get beyond the treaty, with or without the

Russians, and soon.  We disagree.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The tests cited by Rumsfeld that would have &quot;bumped up&quot; against the treaty

involved the use of Aegis radar to track ballistic missiles in flight.

While these tests are prohibited by the treaty, they are not crucial to

development of missile defense at this stage.  At a Council for a Livable

World Education Fund press briefing last August, Philip Coyle, former head

of operational testing and evaluation at the Pentagon, called the Aegis

radar tracking tests a &quot;red herring&quot; that &quot;are just getting people riled

up...by picking this test, they picked a technical area that's not really a

problem for them.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In fact, the tests appeared to have been scheduled earlier this year more

to destroy the ABM Treaty, or to create an excuse to abrogate the treaty,

than to develop an effective national missile defense.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">However, Rumsfeld's statements do show the administration's increasing

respect for multi-lateralism.  Chris Madison, director of the Education

Fund's national missile defense project, commented: &quot;We applaud the

administration's recognition that a unilateral move to violate the treaty

now could jeopardize the international coalition against terrorism.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We hope the administration takes the time needed to negotiate an agreement

with Russia while avoiding unilateral withdrawal from the Treaty,&quot; Madison

continued.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;However,&quot; he noted, &quot;there were strong signals from last weekend's

Bush-Putin meeting that the Administration was prepared to announce in

January that it was giving six month notice of withdrawal from the treaty.

Such a move would be a serious setback for arms control and U.S. security.&quot;
