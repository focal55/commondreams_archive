- April 11 -Following is a statement

by Matthew L. Myers, president of Campaign For Tobacco-Free Kids:

<p>With great fanfare, Philip Morris has introduced its proposal to

give the Food and Drug Administration authority over tobacco.

Despite the rhetoric, Philip Morris' proposal would not lead to

meaningful change or promote the public health. It is a cynical

proposal designed to make it sound like Philip Morris favors strong

regulation, but in reality, it would not require any change in

current tobacco marketing practices or permit the FDA to require

tobacco companies to reduce the harm their products cause. In short,

it will lead to business as usual. We oppose this proposal because

it would mean that more than 400,000 Americans will continue to die

of tobacco-caused disease every year and more than 3,000 kids will

continue to become regular smokers every day.

<p>The public health community is united in support of real FDA

regulation of tobacco that would allow the FDA to prohibit tobacco

marketing that appeals to kids, prohibit deceptive health claims such

as "light", and require that tobacco companies remove known harmful

constituents when they have the know-how to do so. The Philip Morris

proposal would accomplish none of these modest goals.

<p>In fact, Philip Morris' primary goal is to gain the government's

stamp of approval for the so-called "reduced risk" products that it

plans to market with the goal of getting more people to start smoking

and discouraging current smokers from quitting. This is a recipe for

more addiction, disease and death, not less.

<p>Philip Morris' proposal is a major retreat from the form of FDA

regulation to which it agreed during tobacco settlement negotiations

with the state attorneys general in 1997. It is another in a long

line of tobacco industry efforts to head off meaningful legislative

action with empty public relations gestures aimed at preserving the

status quo and protecting the industry's bottom line.

<p>The Philip Morris proposal falls especially short in several

critical areas:

<p>Elimination or reduction of harmful ingredients: One of the most

important aspects of FDA tobacco regulation is the authority to

require changes in tobacco products in order to reduce the death and

disease they cause. While there is no such thing as a safe

cigarette, there are many ways in which the harm could be reduced.

But the Philip Morris proposal would not allow the FDA to require

meaningful changes in tobacco products even if the technology exists

to do so easily and instead establishes cigarettes currently on the

market as the gold standard against which all future products will

be

judged.

<p>The Philip Morris proposal would allow the FDA to prohibit the

addition or removal of an ingredient added during the manufacturing

process only if the ingredient would render the products even more

dangerous than current products; in effect, the FDA could act only

if

the ingredient would result in even more deaths. More important,

Philip Morris would not allow the FDA to require the removal of the

dozens of known cancer-causing constituents that naturally occur in

tobacco products or during the burning process even when they have

the technology to do so. For example, tobacco companies already have

the technology to reduce nitrosamines, one of the more deadly of the

more than 40 identified carcinogens in cigarettes, but the Philip

Morris proposal would not allow the FDA to require tobacco companies

to remove nitrosamines.

<p>Prohibiting marketing that impacts and appeals to kids: Philip

Morris' proposal would not give the FDA authority to restrict

advertising and marketing that appeals to children beyond what they

are already required to do by provisions of the 1998 state tobacco

settlement, which are limited and inadequate. A recent Federal Trade

Commission report showed that tobacco marketing expenditures

increased by the largest amount ever in the first year after the

settlement, reaching a record $8.24 billion a year -- $22 million a

day and nearly $1 million an hour. Much of this increase was in ways

effective at reaching kids, such as two-for-one discounts that reduce

cigarette prices and payments for high visibility store shelf

displays. Other studies have found increased tobacco advertising in

youth-oriented magazines and retail stores since the settlement.

<p>The FDA needs broad authority to restrict marketing that

influences kids, based on the evidence and not on the industry's

false promises that it does not market to kids. The Philip Morris

proposal falls woefully short.

<p>Regulating dangerous and misleading health claims: The tobacco

companies have repeatedly made claims of "reduced risk" that later

proved to be unfounded, deceptive and, in far too many cases, lethal.

One of the prime examples is the introduction in the 1960s of "light"

cigarettes that boasted lower levels of tar in cigarette smoke with

claims of less risk to smokers. In fact, the introduction of lights

did not improve the public health because it led many smokers not to

quit and smokers of lights tend to compensate by smoking more,

inhaling more deeply or blocking ventilation holes. Industry

documents show that the tobacco companies knew that federal standards

for measuring tar in cigarettes were inadequate and misleading, but

still used these standards to market "light" cigarettes with the

implication that smoking them was less hazardous.

<p>The Philip Morris proposal would prohibit the FDA from banning the

use of terms such as "light" and "ultra light." Philip Morris also

calls for the FDA to regulate so-called "reduced risk" products in

a

way that would amount to a government stamp of approval allowing the

tobacco companies to better market these products. The public health

community supports giving the FDA the authority to prohibit such

claims if needed to protect the public health.

<p>Philip Morris' proposal is honest on one count in stating that its

proposal "will be good for our tobacco business." But Philip Morris'

woefully inadequate version of FDA tobacco regulation would do

nothing to protect the public health and serve only to lock in the

deadly status quo.
