- February 2 - Culminating on Feb. 7,

state legislators, union leaders and grassroots advocates in at

least 12 states across the country (AL, AZ, CO, CT, GA, ME, NM, NV,

OH, TX, WI, WV) will sound a challenge to secure equal pay this

legislative session for the thousands of working families who are

unable to become self-sufficient or reach their full earning

potential because they are not paid fairly based on their race and

gender.

<p>This Challenge to Secure Equal Pay for Working Families is

coordinated by the Center for Policy Alternatives, a non-partisan

policy and leadership center in Washington, D.C. "We know that a

dramatic wage gap exists and that both women and men want this

resolved. It's time to deliver on this issue," states Linda

Tarr-Whelan, President of the Center for Policy Alternatives.

<p>On average, families lose over $4,000 each year due to the

gender wage gap alone. Women earn 72 cents for every dollar earned

by men, according to the Census Bureau. African Americans are paid

78 cents for every dollar earned by whites and Latinos earn 67

cents, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. More than half

of women workers are concentrated in sales, clerical and service

jobs including child care, elder care and nursing-jobs that

continue to be underpaid because they are seen as "women's work."

Studies show that these positions typically pay less than jobs

traditionally held by men, even if they require the same skill,

effort and responsibility to do the work. Research also shows that

the wage gap exists regardless of occupation or title-women who are

managers, physicians and computer programmers are paid less than

their male counterparts.

<p>Several states are proposing very workable, straightforward

solutions. One approach -- the Equal Pay Remedies and Enforcement

Act -- toughens the penalties for violations of existing state

equal pay law and creates a statewide job evaluation study to

assess the causes of wage inequities and identify state-specific

recommendations. Today, two out of three workers are employed by

firms that use some form of job evaluation. Other approaches

include raising the wages for specific sectors that are

traditionally underpaid, or prohibiting wage discrimination for

jobs of comparable worth in the public or private sectors, and

instituting stronger tracking and reporting requirements.
