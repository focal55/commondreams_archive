- September 27 - The East Timor Action Network (ETAN) and the Indonesia 

Human Rights Network (IHRN) strongly urge members of Congress to reject any 

request by the Bush administration for authority &quot;to waive all existing 

restrictions on U.S. military assistance and weapons exports for the next 

five years to any country if he determines the aid will help the fight 

against international terrorism,&quot; as reported in the Washington Post on 

September 24. In its drive to build an international coalition in response 

to the horrific attacks on September 11, the U.S. must not sacrifice the 

rights of Indonesians, East Timorese, or others. Any move to lift 

congressional restrictions on U.S. relations with the Indonesian military 

(TNI) would only empower a brutal military immune to accountability for 

human rights violations.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A blanket waiver would undermine years of calculated congressional response 

to the TNI&#146;s own incriminating acts and seriously compromise congressional 

checks on executive action. It would also undeniably result in the use of 

U.S.-supplied weapons, training, and other military assistance in the 

severe repression of Indonesian and possibly East Timorese civilians, a 

practice that IHRN, ETAN, and many others hoped had finally ended. For the 

U.S. to condone and essentially sanction such predictable results would be 

contrary to the very principle of respect for human rights thus far 

advanced by Congress. Rewarding the TNI with prestigious U.S. military 

assistance would only encourage the terror tactics used against the people 

of Aceh, West Papua, and elsewhere.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Such a policy would also contradict the importance placed on rule of law, 

human rights, and justice by Indonesian President Megawati and President 

Bush in their meeting last week. Megawati, referring to the September 11 

attacks, &quot;condemned the barbaric and indiscriminate acts carried out 

against innocent civilians,&quot; and Bush said, &quot;Indonesia&#146;s transition to 

democracy is one of the most significant developments of this era.&quot; Yet the 

Indonesian military, a force that regularly targets civilians, is the 

largest obstacle to democracy. The White House announced that the U.S. 

would lift the embargo on commercial sales of non-lethal defense articles 

and expand contact between the U.S. and Indonesian militaries. These 

commitments, incremental changes reflecting prior Bush administration 

policies, are nonetheless disturbing. They come with no firm commitment 

from Megawati to address human rights abuses of the military and police, 

and her record of close ties with the armed forces that suggests the opposite.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Since the TNI and its militia proxies razed East Timor in September 1999 

the U.S. has withheld most military assistance. Congress legislated 

conditions restricting International Military Education and Training (IMET) 

and the Foreign Military Financing Program for Indonesia. Known as the 

&quot;Leahy conditions,&quot; these include the safe return of East Timorese 

refugees, prosecution of those responsible for atrocities in East Timor and 

Indonesia, and security for East Timor from Indonesian military and militia 

activity. None of these very reasonable conditions have been met. Congress 

separately restricted IMET for Indonesia following the 1991 Santa Cruz 

Massacre where Indonesian soldiers gunned down at least 270 peaceful 

protesters at a memorial service in East Timor.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">These restrictions represent the greatest point of leverage the U.S. has to 

rein in one of the world&#146;s worst human rights records. Overturning 

congressional restrictions would severely undermine the little progress 

made in accountability for crimes against humanity and other violations 

that have taken place in East Timor and Indonesia. Their removal would 

damage efforts to gain civilian control of the Indonesian armed forces and 

seriously threaten the security of East Timor.</font></p>
