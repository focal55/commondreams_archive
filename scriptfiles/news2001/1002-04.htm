<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - October 2 - &#147;Mr. Chairman, as I see it, the Solicitor of Labor is not just the Department of

Labor&#146;s lawyer, but is really the workers&#146; lawyer for the whole country.  He or

she is responsible for enforcing the most fundamental worker protection measures

on the books, won through decades of struggle and sometimes even with blood. 

Minimum wage, the 40_hour work week, occupational safety and health, mine safety

and health, workers comp, family and medical leave __ the Office of Solicitor is

responsible for more than 180 federal laws that cover roughly 10 million

employers and 125 million workers. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;Before I get to some questions that I believe are important to have on the

record, let me say that I met with the nominee in my office some weeks ago.  I

enjoyed our meeting, and I have a great deal of respect for Mr. Scalia&#146;s

intelligence and his capabilities as a lawyer.  I wish him well.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;I won&#146;t be supporting his nomination to this position because I believe, after

reviewing his record and a number of his writings, he is not the right person

for this job. His professional record of apparent antipathy toward the same laws

and principles that it would be his job to carry out make this a mismatch, in my

view. He seems to have been opposed throughout his career to what I see as the

very mission of the Solicitor of Labor. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;Of course, the President is entitled to nominate people he feels are right for

his Administration, and I am supporting the vast majority of this President&#146;s

selections. But as Chair of the Subcommittee with oversight responsibility for

such laws as OSHA, the Fair Labor Standards Act, the National Labor Relations

Act, the Mine Safety and Health Act and others, I have to say I see this one

very differently.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;At a time when many working families face enough insecurity as it is, I believe

we need someone who would instill much more confidence that the Department of

Labor is on working families&#146; side.&#148;</font></p>
