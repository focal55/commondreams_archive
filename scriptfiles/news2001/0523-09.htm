- May 23 - Today's

                    floor votes on private religious school vouchers represent a

                    major setback for the voucher movement, according to

                    Americans United for Separation of Church and State.</font>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In

                    two separate votes, members of the House of Representatives

                    overwhelmingly rejected voucher amendments offered by House

                    Majority Leader Dick Armey (R-Texas). The proposals were

                    amendments to H.R. 1, the Bush administration's education

                    bill.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Americans

                    United said Armey's drive to add voucher language to the

                    House education package flew in the face of the will of the

                    people.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The

                    only place vouchers are popular is in Dick Armey's

                    office,&quot; said AU Executive Director Barry W. Lynn.

                    &quot;House members showed great wisdom today by following

                    the lead of the American people and rejecting Armey's

                    scheme.&quot;</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The

                    first amendment, which would have created a massive national

                    voucher program for so-called &quot;failing schools,&quot;

                    lost by a 273 to 155 vote. The second, which sought to

                    create five pilot voucher projects, was also defeated, 241

                    to 186.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Armey

                    fought for vouchers, arguing his plan is necessary for

                    families in need. At a press conference yesterday, Armey

                    described his voucher amendments as &quot;amendments with a

                    heart.&quot;</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">AU's

                    Lynn believes Armey's efforts are both unwelcome and

                    unpopular with the audience the congressman is targeting.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Armey

                    claims the American people, especially poor families in our

                    nation's inner cities, want a school voucher program,&quot;

                    Lynn added. &quot;But the evidence proves just the

                    opposite.&quot;</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In

                    referenda in California and Michigan last November, voters

                    from all racial, religious and socio-economic groups

                    rejected school voucher plans by huge margins. California

                    voters opposed Prop. 38, a sweeping voucher scheme, by a 71

                    to 29 percent margin. Meanwhile, Michigan voters turned down

                    Proposal 1, a more limited voucher plan, by a 69 to 31

                    percent margin.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">According

                    to exit polls conducted by <i>The Los Angeles Times</i> and

                    the <i>Detroit News</i>:</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>*

                    African-Americans opposed vouchers</b>

                    by a 68-32 percent margin in California. Blacks in Michigan

                    rejected vouchers by nearly four to one, with Detroit voters

                    saying no by a staggering 72-28 percent margin. Whites,

                    Latinos and Asian-Americans also voted against vouchers by

                    large margins.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>*

                    Low-income voters</b>

                    were staunchly opposed to vouchers. In California, those

                    with a family income of $20,000 or less voted against Prop.

                    38 (73-27 percent) at about the same rate as those who made

                    $75,000 or more (70-30 percent).</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>*

                    Republicans, Democrats and Independents</b>

                    all voted against vouchers. In the California referendum, 83

                    percent of Democrats, 72 percent of independents and 53

                    percent of Republicans opposed vouchers. In Michigan, all

                    political camps voted against the scheme, except those who

                    identified themselves as &quot;strong&quot; Republicans.</font></p>

                    Parents of public school students</b>

                    in Michigan voted by more than two to one against vouchers.

                    In California, 68 percent of parents opposed Prop. 38.</font></p>

                    Seventy-eight percent of Americans</b>

                    prefer fixing public schools while only 16 percent want to

                    move to a voucher system, according to a national exit poll

                    of voters reported by <i>The</i> <i>Washington Post</i> last

                    November.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The

                    California and Michigan results are consistent with years of

                    results in other states. In 22 referenda since 1967, voters

                    have rejected ballot proposals to direct tax aid to

                    religious and other private schools.</font></p>

                    Americans United's Lynn, &quot;The people have spoken, Rep.
