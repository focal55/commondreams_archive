- April 10 - A

                    majority of Americans have deep reservations about President

                    George W. Bush's &quot;faith-based&quot; initiative, a new

                    opinion poll shows.</font>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><font size="2">According

                    to a survey released today by the Pew Forum on Religion and

                    Public Life, 68 percent of Americans worry that faith-based

                    programs might lead to too much government involvement with

                    religion, while six out of ten are concerned that publicly

                    funded religious groups would proselytize recipients of

                    social services.</font></span></font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><font size="2">The

                    majority of respondents support government funding for

                    faith-based organizations in general, but an overwhelming 78

                    percent of Americans say government-funded religious groups

                    should not be able to hire only people who share their

                    beliefs to staff their programs, a key component of the Bush

                    plan.</font></span></font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><font size="2">Americans

                    United for Separation of Church and State, which has

                    spearheaded opposition to the Bush plan, said the survey

                    clearly shows that the American people reject the White

                    House proposal.</font></span></font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><font size="2">&quot;Americans

                    don't mind religious social services getting some government

                    aid, as long as there are strict safeguards in place,&quot;

                    said the Rev. Barry W. Lynn, Americans United executive

                    director. &quot;President Bush wants to do away with the

                    safeguards, and people have no intention of saying amen.</font></span></font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><font size="2">&quot;The

                    Bush plan allows religious discrimination with public funds;

                    Americans overwhelmingly say no,&quot; Lynn continued.

                    &quot;The Bush plan allows providers to proselytize needy

                    people; Americans say no. Clearly, people don't have much

                    faith in the Bush approach.&quot;</font></span></font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><font size="2">Religiously

                    affiliated groups such as Catholic Charities and Lutheran

                    Social Services have received government funding for years,

                    said Lynn, but those agencies do not discriminate in hiring

                    or proselytize aid recipients. Under the Bush proposal,

                    government aid would go directly to churches, and they would

                    be allow to engage in preferential hiring and evangelize

                    needy people while providing the tax-funded program.</font></span></font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><font size="2">In

                    addition to the findings mentioned above, the poll also

                    found that many Americans do not want government to fund

                    religious minorities. Only 38 percent thought Muslim mosques

                    should get aid, while the same number supported help for

                    Buddhist temples. A bare majority -- 51 percent -- supported

                    government aid for Mormon churches.</font></span></font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><font size="2">Said

                    AU's Lynn, &quot;The Bush proposal is stirring up

                    unnecessary religious tensions. The Constitution mandates

                    that government treat all religions equally. If majority

                    faiths qualify for aid, minorities must be eligible as well.

                    Yet people are worried that religious groups they don't like

                    or don't understand will get their tax dollars. This scheme

                    has disaster written all over it.&quot;</font></span></font></p>
