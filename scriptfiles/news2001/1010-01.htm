- October 10  - Using high resolution 

satellite images and old-fashioned fieldwork, a team of Russian 

experts has created new maps of the Europe's last remaining 

wilderness forests. What they saw was not pretty: Northern European 

Russia is not the endless sea of forest wilderness that many people 

imagine. Few forest areas remain undisturbed and all are in the 

remote far north. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The results of their five-year effort, The Last Intact Forest 

Landscapes of Northern European Russia, was released simultaneously 

today in Moscow and in Washington, DC by the World Resources 

Institute's Global Forest Watch and Greenpeace Russia. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Only 14 percent or 32 million hectares of the boreal or northern 

forests of European Russia remain in relatively undisturbed large 

blocks of at least 50,000 hectares each. Yet what little is left is 

at risk, since the most attractive parts for exploitation of these 

forests are unprotected by federal or local laws. The researchers 

say that the main threat is fragmentation by logging roads, 

geological survey lines, and fires that usually follow them. The 

environmental cost would be high if these remnants are logged. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The significance of this work goes far beyond Russian 

forestry,&quot; says Dr. Alexander Isaev, a member of the Russian 

Academy of Sciences and a forest minister of the former Soviet 

Union, who reviewed the report together with scientists from 

Russia, Sweden and the U.S. &quot;These are the last big forest 

wilderness areas of Europe and an important part of our common 

European heritage. We need to keep them wild and protected by law.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The authors of the report argue that these remaining intact 

boreal forests are comparatively cheap to conserve. &quot;No forest 

guards are needed. The same remoteness and low productivity which 

has protected them until now will continue to do so,&quot; write A. Y. 

Yaroshenko, P. V. Potapov, and S. A. Turubanova. &quot;Our last 

remaining examples of wild nature can be protected even under the 

very restrictive Russian budget for nature conservation.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">These forests are unsuitable for sustainable wood production 

since they are poorly stocked and tree growth is slow. Timber 

revenues will not cover the cost of reforestation or silviculture 

and the cost of building forest roads. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Less than five percent of the volume logged in the Karelia, 

Komi, Arkhangelsk, and Perm regions come from the remaining intact 

boreal forests of European Russia. Most of this wood goes to 

countries in Western Europe. Several companies have now pledged to 

avoid buying wood from the remaining intact forests of the world. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The maps of the intact forests of European Russia will be 

valuable to many parties involved in promoting responsible 

forestry,&quot; said Susanne Bergstrand, environment manager at the home 

furnishings company, IKEA (<a href="http://www.ikea.com" target="_new">http://www.ikea.com</a>). It is one of the 

major supporters of the World Resources Institute's Global Forest 

Watch. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Mapping European Russia's intact boreal forests took a lot of 

detective work on the part of several Russian environmental 

organizations. They first looked at regular maps and excluded all 

obviously disturbed areas near roads and towns. Then they examined 

detailed satellite images to look for additional signs of 

disturbances, such as logging clearcuts, mines and agricultural 

fields, and then eliminated these areas. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">They used them to outline blocks of intact forests greater than 

50,000 hectares (i.e. at least the size of a square with a 22-km. 

or 14-mile side). Only sufficiently large blocks of forests are 

deemed capable of remaining intact, i.e. conserving natural, 

undisturbed populations of large animals while at the same time 

letting natural processes such as storms and fires run their 

course. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To verify the maps, the research team inspected 67 areas in the 

field to make sure that the satellite images were correctly 

interpreted. The resulting maps are the first of their kind, 

something which the Russian government has yet to create. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Later this year, Global Forest Watch and its Russian partners 

will release a similar map of the entire forests of Russia. This is 

expected to be the first such map of Russia. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The project succeeded by using a combination of new 

technologies, unprecedented cooperation among local Russian 

environmental groups, and a desire for transparency in the 

management of the country's natural resources. The maps and other 

information are made available to the public through the Internet 

( or <a href="http://www.forests.ru" target="_new">http://www.forests.ru</a> or <a href="http://www.greenpeace.ru" target="_new">http://www.greenpeace.ru</a>). </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The same approach is being used to produce reports on the intact 

forests of Chile, Venezuela and Indonesia, all of which will be 

released in the next six months. Similar mapping work is going on 

in Canada, U.S., and Brazil. This is all part of a global effort to 

map and monitor the remaining frontier forests of the world -- of 

which only half are left. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">During the next 5 years, the Global Forest Watch network will 

span 21 countries and cover 80 percent of the world's remaining 

intact forests.
