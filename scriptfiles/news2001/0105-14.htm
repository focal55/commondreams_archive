- January 5 - &quot;President Clinton has today done more to protect 

Americans' heritage of public lands than any president since Teddy 

Roosevelt.  The pristine national forest lands at stake provide us with a 

living legacy of wild forests and wildlife that have been destroyed 

elsewhere in our country and in much of the world.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;By designating nearly 60 million acres of wild national forests as off 

limits to further road building and to most logging and oil, gas and 

mineral development, President Clinton has moved to ensure that these lands 

and the fish and wildlife they support are preserved for future generations.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We at Earthjustice are particularly pleased that the Administration has 

heeded the voices of hundreds of thousands of citizens and has moved to 

protect roughly nine million acres of Alaska's Tongass National 

Forest.  Now, much of this unique, old-growth rainforest will remain as 

wild in the future as it is today.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Some lawmakers, including Rep Jim Hansen of Utah and Sen. Frank Murkowski 

of Alaska, have said that they will fight the President's actions in court 

and on Capitol Hill.  We hope that common sense will win out and that the 

fact that this is one of the most publicly supported forest initiatives 

ever  with almost two million comments being registered  will prevent a 

partisan attack on the new policy.  If necessary, however, Earthjustice is 

fully prepared to defend it in any court in the land and on Capitol 

Hill.  Earthjustice has fought to protect roadless areas throughout its 

30-year history, and we will continue to fight to ensure that this forest 

legacy is both upheld and followed.&quot;</font></p>
