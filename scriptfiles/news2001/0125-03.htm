- January 25 - The Joint Chiefs of Staff got an early start to Christmas

2001 when they dispatched representatives to Capitol Hill on Tuesday to

lobby the Senate Armed Services Committee for supplemental appropriations

expected to total $10 billion.  The move angered not only newly confirmed

Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, who immediately ordered a stop to

such lobbying efforts, but also Appropriations Committee members in

Congress who have jurisdiction over the mid-year spending bills. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The request for &quot;emergency&quot; funds would be added to the defense budget

total for fiscal year 2001 which is already authorized at about $310

billion -- a $20 billion dollar increase from the previous year.  The move

came as a surprise to the Bush Administration, which has not figured out

its budget plans.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The Chiefs are end-running the new Administration,&quot; argued John Isaacs,

President of the defense reform group Council for a Livable World, whose

recently released report &quot;No Increase Necessary&quot; recommends limiting &quot;rogue

operations&quot; run by the Chiefs -- frequently in collusion with key politicians.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The report advises &quot;reigning in the Pentagon's Christmas list.&quot;  In recent

years, in response to request from key committees, the services have

submitted &quot;wish lists&quot; directly to Congress without going through the

normal budget processes within the Pentagon or the Office of Management and

Budget. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Only in the Pentagon could you ask for a $10 billion raise without first

checking with your boss,&quot; said Isaacs.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Council report also recommends addressing the financial and accounting

problems that bedevil the Pentagon before giving the military new handouts.

 According to the Council, &quot;accounting at DoD is horrific.&quot;  The group

cites a Pentagon Inspector General report that found $2.3 trillion in

unsupported accounting entries and a General Accounting Office report that

describes billions of dollars in missing items.  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Accusing Pentagon planners of being &quot;frozen in Cold War thinking,&quot; the

report recommends canceling weapons such as the Crusader mobile howitzer,

the F-22 tactical aircraft and the V-22 Osprey.   Such cancellations would

assist President Bush in following through on his campaign pledge to  &quot;skip

a generation&quot; of weapons now in development, according to the Council report.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Council also criticizes Congress for using defense spending bills as

vehicles for adding billions in pork-barrel projects that waste taxpayer

dollars.  According to Sen. John McCain (R-AZ), the Senate's top pork

buster, Congress added $7 billion in unrequested spending to the fiscal

2001 defense spending bill.  The report points out that those funds would

&quot;easily pay for the readiness shortfalls&quot; often cited by the Pentagon.  </font></p>
