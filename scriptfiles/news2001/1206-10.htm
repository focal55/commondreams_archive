- December 6 - The Sierra Club today criticized Congress for voting in

favor of &quot;Fast Track&quot;, also known as Trade Promotion Authority, (H.R.

3005).  With this extremely close  vote, Congress surrenders its

constitutional responsibility to set the course of U.S. trade policy.   The

Sierra Club opposed the bill because trade agreements increasingly threaten

clean air, clean water and public lands both in America and around the

world.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We shouldn't rush through important trade deals without making sure that

all Americans' needs are addressed--including protections for the

environment and workers.  But that's by definition what 'fast track' does,&quot;

said Carl Pope, Executive Director of the Sierra Club.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Under fast track, Congress gives up the power to fix trade deals made by

U.S. negotiators--even if those deals threaten the environment, or workers'

rights.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Of special concern to the Sierra Club is that this fast track bill could

expand NAFTA-style corporate lawsuits to other nations.  Under these rules,

global corporations can sue U.S. taxpayers for huge sums of money if they

believe America's hard-won environmental, health, and safety laws interfere

with their profits.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Many Members of Congress showed tremendous courage in standing up to the

corporate lobby in opposing fast track,&quot; continued Pope.  &quot;In the wake of

this highly partisan vote that defied the will of the American people, our

fair trade coalition emerged with significant momentum to ensure that

future anti-environmental trade deals never become law. When our health,

safety and clean environment are at stake, we should make sure that all

sides are heard before we move ahead with these trade deals.&quot;
