- April 24 - Calling the first three months 

              of the Bush administration an &#147;environmental failure,&#148; 

              the League of Conservation Voters (LCV) today released a citizen&#146;s 

              guide detailing the president&#146;s environmental actions during 

              his first 100 days in office. The guide highlights the many environmental 

              rollbacks, delays and broken promises of this administration, while 

              acknowledging several pro-environment steps for which Bush has taken 

              credit.

<p> </p>

<p>&#147;The Bush administration&#146;s environmental assault during 

              its first 100 days has failed the majority of Americans who want 

              stronger, better enforced environmental safeguards,&#148; said LCV 

              President Deb Callahan. &#147;Bush clearly believes in recycling; 

              he&#146;s claimed credit and sought praise for recycling the policies 

              of his predecessor. In the end, President Bush&#146;s environmental 

              agenda is driven by special interests, not the public interest, 

              and his actions threaten decades of progress to protect our health 

              and our natural resources.&#148; </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Among his more controversial moves, President Bush has proposed 

              slashing $2.2 billion in environmental funding from the federal 

              budget, called to open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil 

              drilling, delayed protections against arsenic in drinking water 

              and broken a promise to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. Last week 

              the administration responded to the intense public criticism of 

              its actions with a public relations campaign to &#147;green&#148; 

              its environmental image. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>According to Callahan, all eyes now to turn to Congress to see 

              whether a bipartisan coalition for the environment will be the last 

              line of defense against the administration&#146;s attacks on protections 

              for air, water and land. &#147;The 2002 elections are going to be 

              a referendum on the nature of environmental protection in America,&#148; 

              Callahan said. &#147;Bipartisan polling shows by more than a 3 to 

              1 margin that voters prefer candidates who support environmental 

              protection over those supporting corporate interests. Upcoming votes 

              on the president&#146;s anti-environment agenda will show which 

              side members of Congress are on, placing their political future 

              and the environmental future of our country on the same footing.&#148;
