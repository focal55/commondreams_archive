- January 25 - The

          White House announced today that President George W. Bush will unveil

          plans for a major &quot;faith-based&quot; social service initiative

          next week.</font>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Americans

          United for Separation of Church and State, a national church-state

          watchdog group and a leading critic of the Bush proposal, described

          the new initiative as a misguided and dangerous approach to public

          policy. The scheme will reportedly include a new office in the White

          House to promote government aid to church-run social services.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;People

          shouldn't have to go to a church they may not believe in to get help

          from the government,&quot; said the Rev. Barry W. Lynn, executive

          director of Americans United. &quot;Placing people in need in this

          kind of position is just plain wrong. This is a radical assault on the

          American tradition of church-state separation.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The

          Constitution created a separation between religion and government, not

          a massive new bureaucracy designed to unite the two,&quot; added Lynn,

          a United Church of Christ minister and an attorney. &quot;The very

          existence of a federal office whose principal purpose is to give tax

          dollars to religious groups is in irreparable conflict with the First

          Amendment.&quot;</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">According

          to materials distributed during the campaign, Bush wants to distribute

          federal tax dollars to religious groups to provide a plethora of

          social services now being provided by government agencies or secular

          groups. These services would include after-school programs for

          children, job training, drug treatment, prison rehabilitation programs

          and abstinence programs.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Critics

          say these kinds of faith-based initiatives are burdened with many

          serious flaws. Among the most serious is a provision that would allow

          federally funded employment discrimination on religious grounds. A

          religious group, for example, will be able to receive public tax

          dollars to pay for a job, but still be free to hang up a sign that

          says &quot;Jews Need Not Apply.&quot;</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Just

          imagine: your money pays for a job that you can't have because of your

          religious beliefs,&quot; Lynn observed. &quot;That's not compassionate

          conservatism, that's blatant bigotry.&quot;</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Critics

          also charge that the Bush plan will jeopardize the independence and

          integrity of church-run social service programs.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;What

          the government funds, it always regulates,&quot; said Lynn. &quot;Once

          churches, temples, mosques and synagogues are being financed by the

          public, some of their freedom will be placed in jeopardy by the almost

          certain regulation to follow.&quot;</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Bush's

          faith-based initiative is part of a broader effort to expand so-called

          &quot;charitable choice&quot; funding, which originated with former-Sen.

          John Ashcroft (R-Mo.) during the drafting of the 1996 Welfare Reform

          Act. The concept changed existing law to permit public funding of

          &quot;pervasively sectarian&quot; groups where religion permeates

          every aspect of the institution.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Faith-based

          initiatives were a center point of Bush's presidential campaign. As

          Bush describes it, this program will be part of a broader mobilization

          effort of what Bush has called his &quot;armies of compassion.&quot;</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Bush

          has explained that the office, once in place, will remove barriers

          that prevent additional funding of religious groups, coordinate

          federal funding from multiple government agencies and encourage states

          to establish their own offices of faith-based action to facilitate

          state funds going to religious groups.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;In

          every instance where my administration sees a responsibility to help

          people, we will look first to faith-based organizations, charities and

          community groups that have shown their ability to save and change

          lives,&quot; Bush said on July 22, 1999.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;There's

          nothing compassionate about Bush's legally dubious scheme,&quot;

          concluded Lynn. &quot;Contributions to religious groups must come from

          supporters voluntarily, not be forced by the government. Bush's

          faith-based initiative is a constitutional nightmare and a disastrous

          step in the wrong direction.&quot;</font></p>
