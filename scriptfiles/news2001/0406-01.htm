- April 6 -  Greenpeace applauded the Thai Government’s decision to stop the release of all Genetically Engineered (GE) crops into the environment and no longer allow any GE field trials in Thailand. 

<p>With this decision Thailand takes the lead in Asia to protect its environment, biodiversity and farmers from genetic pollution.

<p>The cabinet of the Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra decided to 

instruct the Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives to halt all 

approvals for GE field trials (1). 

<p>The decision should also mark the end of ongoing field trials on GE cotton and GE corn, conducted by agribusiness giant Monsanto, the second largest seed provider in Thailand (2). 

<p>Thailand has already banned all commercial growing of GE crops on its territory (3).

<p>“Thailand’s biodiversity is unique and precious. It is our culture, 

our food and our future. Greenpeace congratulates this Government action to protect our food and fields from the dangers of genetic engineering and encourages other ASEAN governments to follow. We demand that Monsanto respects this decision and terminate their existing field trials,” said ecologist Dr Jiragorn Gajaseni, Executive Director of Greenpeace South East Asia. 

<p>By making this bold decision Thailand can avoid the environmental 

and economic problems already being experienced by those 

countries that have adopted GE crops. In Canada GE canola is 

developing into a major weed problem, which requires the use of 

conventional toxic herbicides for removal. In the United States 

over a billion dollars have been spent trying to recall a genetically 

engineered potentially allergenic Starlink corn, which 

contaminated 430 million bushels of harvest.  

<p>In order to truly assure Thailand’s GE free status, Greenpeace 

calls on the government to now urgently check and control 

remaining imports of genetically engineered food and 

commodities, such as corn and soybeans from the US. 

<p>“Thailand has taken the first step to protect Asia from the threat 

of genetic engineering. The message is clear: The only way to 

prevent genetic pollution from GE crops is never to plant them in 

the first place,” said Auaiporn Suthonthanyakorn, Greenpeace GE 

campaigner for South East Asia.

<p>

<p>Notes:<br>

(1)Decision of the Prime Minister 50/2001, made on 3 April is an 

    instruction and it translates: the Ministry of Agriculture and 

    Cooperative to halt all GE crop field trials. On the same day it 

    was decided to set up a panel to draft a biosafety act, 

    farmers, consumers and academics will participate in this 

    panel. 

<p>(2) In 2000, the two GE crops allowed for field testing in Thailand 

were Monsanto's Bt (bacillus thuriengiensis) Bollgard cotton 

and Monsanto's Bt corn, both genetically engineered to kill 

insects. For the Bt Bollgard cotton, Monsanto has a permit to 

conduct field trials for this and the next year. Monsanto’s field 

trials have been contested by Thai farmers’ organisations and 

environmental groups.

<p>(3) In October 1999, the Thai Economic Policy Committee 

decided to ban the import of GE seeds for commercial cultivation, 

but continued to allow research-oriented imports. The ban will 

continue until GMOs are scientifically proven to be safe.
