- April 10 - The Bush Administration released its budget on April 9, although the

details on military spending will not be available for at least another

month.  While overall discretionary spending will rise $25.7 billion, the

Pentagon will receive $14.2 billion or 55 percent of the increase.  </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Total Discretionary Spending over which Congress has direct control:<br>

Fiscal 2001 enacted: $635.0 billion<br>

Fiscal 2002 request: $660.7 billion<br>

Increase: $25.7</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Total Defense (including Dept. of Energy):<br>

Fiscal 2001 enacted: $310.6 billion<br>

Fiscal 2002 request: $324.8 billion<br>

Increase: $14.2 </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to House Budget Committee Democrats, expenditures of non-defense

programs will rise only 0.4%, or $6.2 billion below the level to keep up

with inflation.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Meanwhile, last week the Senate voted to add $10 billion for defense when

it considered the budget resolution, bringing the total to a staggering

$335 billion.  At that level, defense spending would actually reach the

Cold War average.  From 1946 to 1989 the United States spent an average of

$336 billion a year on defense.  During that time, we were facing a

powerful and confident Soviet Union with huge conventional forces, a mighty

nuclear force, and a chain of allies throughout Eastern and Central Europe.  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">While the Pentagon is a budget winner, many domestic discretionary programs

suffer funding cuts:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">$189 million from Higher Education<br>

$541 million from Training and Employment Services<br>

$1.026 billion from Law Enforcement Assistance, Community Policing and

other justice programs<br>

$223 million from Small and Minority Business Assistance (31%)<br>

$227 million from disaster relief<br>

$109 million from Small Business Administration disaster loans (59%)<br>

$338 million from Energy Supply programs<br>

$354.1 million from clean up programs at former defense sites<br>

$756 million from Water Resources programs including flood prevention efforts<br>

$498 million from Pollution control and abatement programs<br>

$1.23 billion from Conservation and Land Management programs<br>

$144 million from Animal and Plant Inspection program<br>
