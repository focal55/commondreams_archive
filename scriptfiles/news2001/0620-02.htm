- June 18 - <P><LI>JOAN CLAYBROOK, [via

Shannon Little, <A HREF="mailto:slittle@citizen.org">slittle@citizen.org</A>], <A HREF="http://www.citizen.org">www.citizen.org</A><BR>

President of Public Citizen, Claybrook said today: "As lawmakers delve into the Ford-Firestone tragedy, a larger issue needs to be addressed: Rollover crashes are dangerous, but they need not be deadly. The federal regulatory agency that oversees the

companies has failed the American public. The National Highway Traffic Safety

Administration -- under constant pressure from auto manufacturers -- doesn't

require companies to design vehicles in a way that will help people survive

rollover crashes. Indeed, the NHTSA has never set a limit on how unstable a

vehicle may be. Ford and Firestone have been blaming each other for the more

than 200 deaths and 700 injuries that have occurred in Ford-Firestone crashes.

Both are right -- Firestone produced a faulty tire, as Ford has said. And Ford

manufactured and zealously marketed its Explorer despite knowing it was prone

to rolling over, like its precursor, the Bronco II. However, an overlooked

issue is NHTSA's failure to issue key rollover crashworthiness standards. When

the Explorer rolls over, the roof crushes inward, leading to devastating head

and neck injuries. The sides can buckle inward, the windows splinter and the

occupants can be tossed about the cabin or ejected. In a rollover crash, the

forces exerted upon the vehicle and occupant are actually far less in

gravitational terms than those that occur in many frontal crashes, which are

now survivable due to the use of air bags and seat belts. Yet rollover crashes

cause one-third of occupant deaths, more than 10,400 lives annually. Ford and

the other manufacturers of SUVs could install a new kind of synthetic roof that

acts like a roll bar and prevents roofs from crushing. In 1991 Congress

directed NHTSA to conduct a rulemaking on a minimum rollover standard but in

1994 NHTSA abandoned its rulemaking, opting instead to develop a consumer

information rule, which is far less stringent. The absence of a rollover

standard has fostered an entire class of popular but dangerously unstable

vehicles."

Milchen, the founder of ReclaimDemocracy.org, said today: "Ford and Firestone officials received complaints as early as 1997 and knew of at least 35 deaths and 130 injuries

before the federal government launched a probe early last year. It is clear

that executives at Ford and Firestone willfully and knowingly kept unsafe

products on the market that they knew would kill many more innocent people.

These executives have received no punishment for their actions. Indeed, there

has not been a single indictment of either corporation, nor of any culpable

corporate officers to date. Nearly every candidate for public office talks

tough on street crime, but then ignores the fact that corporate crime costs our

society more than street crime in both dollars and lives taken. If you loan

your friend a car you know to be unsafe while withholding that information, you

could be convicted of involuntary manslaughter in the event of a fatal

accident. Yet we permit corporate officers to commit the same offense with

impunity if they do it on the job. Corporate executives regularly deploy

cost-benefit analyses that weigh the potential cost of civil lawsuits or fines

for the rare criminal convictions against the cost of recalls or other safety

measures. We must change laws that exempt corporate employees from liability

for crimes committed on company time. To truly reclaim democratic authority and

protect ourselves from recidivist corporations, we should consider the practice

of our country's founders. They regularly exercised a corporate 'death penalty'

by revoking the charters of recidivist corporations whose products or actions

harmed society.&quot;
