hotel workers and others are expected to permanently lose their 

jobs or be displaced for a long period of time in the aftermath of 

the terrorist attack that has destroyed the World Trade Center and 

other buildings in lower Manhattan. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Service Employees International Union (SEIU) September 11th 

Relief Fund has been set up for tax-deductible contributions to 

provide assistance to workers and their families affected by the 

tragedy. More than $600,000 of the $1 million has already been 

raised, with more coming in every day. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Five-year-old David Long of Davenport, Iowa sent in a crayon 

drawing with a note about how sad he is, plus he donated his entire 

piggy bank of $120.22. Many low-wage workers are sending in what 

they can, and notes and letters of support arrive from around the 

world every day. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">More than 1,000 SEIU members worked as security, cleaners and 

tour guides at the World Trade Center. It is known that two window 

washers who were working on the 102nd floor at the time of the 

attack have been lost. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The whereabouts of 24 workers, including janitors, day porters 

and security guards and 40 public employees is not yet known. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Thousands of SEIU members who work in the health care 

institutions in New York responded to the call for help and have 

been working around the clock providing emergency medical care to 

the victims. Two Emergency Medical Technicians (EMTs) are 

unaccounted for, and one is confirmed missing. </font></p>
