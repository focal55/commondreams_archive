- June 13 - During the last ten years, the Pharmaceutical Research

and Manufacturers Association (PhRMA) and its member

companies wrote a prescription for an estimated $360 million

in lobbying, advertising, and political donations to

protect their ambitious legislative agenda, according

to a report released today by the Common Cause Education

Fund (CCEF).  And that agenda, says the report, has

resulted in higher costs for consumers, less access to

affordable drugs for the sick and elderly, and special

tax breaks for what is considered to be one of the world's

most profitable industries.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The CCEF report documents how brand-name drug companies

spent more than a quarter of a billion dollars to lobby

the federal government, and how those lobbying efforts

were backed up by more than $21.4 million in soft money

contributions to national party committees, and more

than $16.6 million in political action committee (PAC)

donations to federal candidates.  The report also details

how the industry has created and used deceptively named

front groups like &quot;Citizens for Better Medicare&quot; to put

a pro-consumer sheen on their pro-industry efforts.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;No one faults this industry for its quest for reasonable

profitability,&quot; Common Cause Education Fund President

Scott Harshbarger said.  &quot;But this is an industry that

has used its political power to sabotage all efforts to

reduce the cost of prescription drugs for American

families - hurting our pocketbooks and jeopardizing our

health.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Congress has responded to the industry's generosity with

an overdose of special favors, generous tax breaks, and

other favorable legislation, according to the report,

including:</font></p>

<ul>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Patent extensions.</b>  Congress has helped brand-name

companies hold on to the patents on some of their most

profitable products, preventing consumers from taking

advantage of less expensive generic versions.  Twice,

legislation passed by Congress has helped Schering-Plough

hold on to its patent on the popular allergy drug,

Claritin, extending the company's monopoly on the drug

for nearly four more years. Nevertheless, Schering-Plough

continues to fight to keep its Claritin patent beyond its

current 2002 expiration date.</font><br>

<br>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Schering-Plough made a $50,000 donation to the Democratic

Senatorial Campaign Committee (DSCC), then chaired by

Senator Robert Torricelli (D-NJ) - just a day before the

Senator introduced legislation that would give Claritin

and six other drugs the chance to have their patents

extended. </font><br>

<br>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">During the same summer that Senator - and presidential

candidate - Orrin Hatch (R-UT) and his staff were flying

Schering-Plough's Gulfstream jet five times, he was

holding hearings on the Torricelli legislation. <br>

<br>

 </font></li>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Freeloading on government research.</b>  The industry has

successfully fought efforts to restore rules requiring

reasonable pricing for drugs developed with the help of

government funding from the National Institutes of Health

(NIH).  Even though the NIH spent $32 million helping

develop Bristol- Myers Squibb's powerful Taxol breast

and ovarian cancer drug, the company charged top dollar

for the mediation.  A full course of treatment with

Taxol can cost between $10,000 and $20,000 - earning

$1 billion a year for Bristol Myers Squibb.</font><br>

<br>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">An amendment that would have forced drug companies to

charge &quot;reasonable prices&quot; for government-aided drugs

passed overwhelmingly in the House of Representatives - 

but was killed in the Senate in 2000.<br>

<br>

</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Tax breaks.  </b>The Congressional Research Service found

in 2000 that the pharmaceutical industry was the most

lightly taxed of all major industries - thanks in large

part to a slew of custom-built tax breaks offered by

Congress over the years.  These breaks include a tax

credit for research and experimentation, which the

industry has been able to extend ten times - even to

companies that charge U.S. consumers much more than

they charge foreign consumers.  Even when Congress has

phased out a measure that disproportionately aids the

pharmaceutical industry - like a tax break for companies

with operations in Puerto Rico - Congress has done so

on the industry's terms.</font></li>
