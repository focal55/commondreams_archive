attempting to confirm a report from sources in Maine

that a Green was detained by officials at Bangor

International Airport because of her political

affiliation.  </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Greens support measures to keep air traffic safe

during the current crisis, as long as constitutional

rights are not violated and people who engage in

nonviolent political dissent are not targeted. 

Numerous Green Party organizers and activists have

flown over the past weeks without incident, and they

have complied in every way with airport security

measures.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">PLEASE NOTE: Recent press reports on the incident

contained incorrect information about the affiliation

of the Green Party member, stating that Nancy Oden is

a &quot;coordinating committee member&quot; of the Green Party

of the United States.  Ms. Oden is not a member of the

party's Coordinating Committee (which consists of

delegates from affiliated states), but of a different

organization.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Green Party of the United States is the only Green

political organization organized nationally as a

party, in which at least 31 states are represented

(with other states' memberships pending).  It

organized the Green National Convention in Denver in

June, 2000, at which Ralph Nader was nominated to run

for President, and is recognized among Green Parties

around the world.  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Green Party of the United States has filed papers

with the Federal Election Commission for recognition

as a national party with national committee status,

and expects an announcement of the FEC's decision

within the next few weeks.  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Media inquiries about national policies and activities

of the Green Party should be directed solely to the

Green Party of the United States, through its media

representatives as listed in the heading above.  To

contact state Green Parties, visit the Green Party of

the United States web site &lt;<a href="http://gpus.org" target="_new">http://gpus.org</a>&gt; and

follow the links to the state parties and their

contacts and web sites.</font></p>
