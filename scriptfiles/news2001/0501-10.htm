Director of Vieques Historic Archives and a spokesperson for the Committee for the Rescue and Development of Vieques, Rabin said today: "The people of Vieques, with the

wide support of the Puerto Rican community, have mounted an intense campaign to

end 60 years of U.S. Navy presence, exercises and destruction of the island of

Vieques. Since the death of a civilian security guard on April 19, 1999, there

have been protests.... The recent resumption of bombing on April 27 sparked

widespread civil disobedience with over 150 people arrested for entering into

the bombing zone as human shields to stop the bombing."

President Bush's speech this afternoon puts National Missile Defense in the spotlight. Hartung is senior research fellow at the World Policy Institute and co-author of

"Toward a New Nuclear Posture: Challenges for the Bush Administration. He said today: "There is no workable missile defense on the horizon.... A ballistic missile is the least likely method an adversary would choose for delivering a nuclear weapon to U.S. soil.... An early decision to break out of the Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty and deploy a missile defense

system could spark a renewed global nuclear arms race.... A multi-tiered system

of the kind favored by Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld will be enormously

expensive, dwarfing the $60 billion price tag for the Clinton NMD system and

creating a huge potential windfall for the Big Four missile defense

contractors."

Professor of journalism at the State University of New York, Grossman -- who just completed

production of the film "Star Wars Returns" -- will be testifying in

London before members of Parliament on Thursday. He said today: "The spin

is 'missile defense,' but what the administration is seeking to do, in the

words of the Rumsfeld Space Commission (see: <A HREF="http://www.defenselink.mil/pubs/space20010111.html">www.defenselink.mil/pubs/space20010111.html</A>),

is: 'conduct operations to, from, in and through space in support of its

national interests both on earth and in space.'"

Pacific Mountain Region Director of the American Friends Service Committee, Riles said today: "The Bush administration has stepped up the search for another enemy. That

does not bode well for the needs of U.S. citizens. 'Missile defense' is a major

aspect of that; so is targeting China as the enemy. While Clinton was almost

near the end of negotiating an agreement with North Korea, Bush basically ended

the South Korean president's initiative to resolve that conflict."

<P><LI>BEAU GROSSCUP, <A HREF="mailto:bgrosscup@csuchico.edu">

Yesterday, the State Department released its annual report "Patterns of Global Terrorism."

Grosscup, who is author of <I>The Newest Explosions of Terrorism</I>, said

today: "The report is an important instrument in the continuous effort by

the U.S. government to construct a jingoistic image of terrorism."
