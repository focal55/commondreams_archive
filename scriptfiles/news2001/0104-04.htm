- January 4 - The Violence Policy Center (VPC), a national organization 

        working to reduce gun death and injury in America, today announced its 

        strong opposition to the nomination of former Missouri Senator John Ashcroft 

        for United States Attorney General. The VPC announcement represents the 

        first time in the organization's 12-year history that it has publicly 

        opposed a federal cabinet nominee. 

      

<P>VPC Public Policy Director Joe Sudbay states, "During the 2000 elections, 

        the National Rifle Association claimed that if George Bush won the presidency, 

        the NRA would be working out of his office. Now they've gone one better. 

        If John Ashcroft becomes attorney general, the NRA will be running the 

        Justice Department." Issues cited by the VPC in its opposition to Ashcroft 

        include:

<ul>

        

<li><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica"> 

          Ashcroft would be the first Attorney General in recent history who has 

          been the beneficiary of massive spending by a special interest group 

          with a political agenda that is in direct conflict with the duties of 

          the office. During the 2000 election cycle, the NRA spent $339,237 in 

          independent expenditures on behalf of Ashcroft in his failed Senate 

          reelection bid. The NRA's PAC also made direct contributions to the 

          Ashcroft campaign. <br>

<li><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica"> 

          Ashcroft endorsed and worked on behalf of a failed 1999 NRA-backed referendum 

          in Missouri that would have allowed the carrying of concealed handguns 

          by convicted criminals, including child molesters and stalkers, throughout 

          the state. <br>

<li><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica"> 

          Ashcroft supports NRA efforts to immediately destroy essential records 

          maintained under the Brady law's National Instant Check System (NICS) 

          that ensure the system's effectiveness and accuracy. Currently the records 

          are retained for six months.<br>

          <br>

          </font></font></li>

<li><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica"> 

          Ashcroft voted last Congress to weaken the Brady law. During Senate 

          debate on whether to expand the current Brady NICS background check 

          to all sales at gun shows (not just those by federally licensed dealers), 

          Ashcroft not only voted against the measure, but voted for legislation 

          sponsored by NRA Board Member Senator Larry Craig (R-ID) that would 

          have weakened the Brady law by reducing the time allowed to conduct 

          the background check by <i>all</i> gun-show sellers—including licensed 

          dealers—from three business days to 24 hours.<br>

          <br>

          </font></font></li>

<li><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica"> 

          Ashcroft opposes the federal assault weapons ban. In September 2004 

          the federal ban on specific assault weapons and new high-capacity magazines—which 

          is supported by virtually every major national law enforcement organization—will 

          come up for reauthorization by Congress. Ashcroft opposes the assault 

          weapons ban and twice voted in the Senate against a ban on the importation 

          of foreign-made high-capacity magazines. The Justice Department will 

          likely play a key role in determining what form the reauthorized ban 

          will take and whether or not needed improvements to the ban are made. 

          </font></font></li>

</ul>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica"> 

        VPC Legislative Director Kristen Rand adds, "John Ashcroft will place 

        the health and welfare of the NRA and its gun industry allies over that 

        of the American public. What this means is simple: more assault weapons, 

        less vigorous enforcement of federal gun laws, and a rollback of the Brady 

        law. The Senate should not approve his nomination." </font></font></p>
