- May 23 - As he turns 60, Bob Dylan is paying back a 30-year-old debt he says he owes to his first fans -- animals. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dylan, who is 60 on Thursday, has given one of his classic songs, &quot;Shelter from the Storm,&quot; to World Wildlife Fund for use in a new public service announcement. It is the first time, in his long and distinguished career as one of America's most influential singer-songwriters, that Dylan has allowed his words and music to be used for charitable purposes. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Its nice to know something I did a long time ago can help save animals today,&quot; the singer said. &quot;WWF is a good cause, I support them, and am proud to lend my music to this effort. Early on, animals were the only ones who liked my music. Now it's pay back time.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Shelter from the Storm&quot; is being used as the soundtrack for two WWF public service ads that make the point that wild animals and their habitats need shelter from man-made environmental storms. The TV spots are narrated by actor Donald Sutherland. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;All of us at WWF are extremely grateful to Bob Dylan for his support,&quot; said Ginette Hemley, WWF's vice president for species conservation. &quot;As human-induced pressures on natural habitats increase, the challenge of saving endangered species becomes more difficult by the day. Mr. Dylan's gift of song will help us meet that challenge by making more Americans aware of the issues and what they can do to help.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 60 and 30-second spots, produced by the PlowShare Group of Stamford, Ct., are being released this week to networks and TV stations across the country. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;If a song can help save an animal, I'm glad it's my song,&quot; Dylan said. &quot; If I can give something back and it can do some good to speak for those animals who can't speak for themselves, Amen.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">PlowShare Group works exclusively with non-profit organizations to harness the power of communications for social good. </font></p>
