- July 17 - News Advisory:

<p>WHO:

<br>-- Defenders of Wildlife President Rodger Schlickeisen

<br>

-- National Wildlife Federation Senior Director for

Legislative Affairs Jim Lyon

<br>

-- Representatives of National Farm &amp; Environmental

Organizations

<p>WHAT:

<br>

Launch of multi-state television advertising campaign by

environmental, agriculture, and rural groups to restore funding

for the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Wetlands Reserve

Program (WRP), Wildlife Habitat Improvement Program (WHIP), and

the Farmland Protection Program (FPP). Beta- format copies of

the commercial will be available to broadcast media at the

event.

<p>WHEN:

<br>Thursday, July 19, 2001

<br>9 a.m. to 10 a.m.

<p>WHERE:

<br>National Press Club, (Edward R. Murrow Room) 13th Floor

<br>529 14th Street, NW, Washington, DC 20045

<p>WHY:

<br>

Despite tremendous farmer demand for these initiatives and

considerable conservation benefits derived from the WRP, WHIP &amp;

FPP, President Bush's budget zeroed out these three programs and

the House of Representatives refused to appropriate money for

them. Loss of these voluntary, farmer-driven programs would be

devastating to local and national private lands conservation

work. These cuts are dramatically at odds with the president's

rhetoric about voluntary, locally-led environmental programs.

<p>The television ad campaign will encourage citizens in several

key states to find out where their senators stand on funding for

these vital agricultural conservation initiatives, as the U.S.

Senate has the opportunity to reverse these short-sighted cuts

by the president and the House of Representatives.
