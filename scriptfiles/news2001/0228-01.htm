- February 28 - An energy plan unveiled this week by Sen. Frank Murkowski (R-Alaska)

would do little or nothing to address America&#146;s energy problems, despite the fact

that it calls for spending billions in taxpayer dollars on corporate subsidies, according

to a Public Citizen analysis of the bill.

<p>Many of the billion-dollar subsidies included in Murkowski&#146;s bill (S. 388 and S.

389)<font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2"> </font>would encourage the use of dangerous nuclear

facilities and inefficient oil wells. Missing are increased fuel efficiency standards and

other conservation strategies &#151; a glaring omission considering that two-thirds of

America&#146;s oil consumption is used in transportation. The bill calls for opening up

the sensitive Alaska National Wildlife Refuge to drilling, even though a 6 percent

increase in auto fuel efficiency standards would, within three years, equal the total

amount of recoverable oil estimated to be in the refuge<font SIZE="2">.</font></p>



<p>The bill lavishes more than $1 billion on the nuclear industry, including $750 million

in &quot;production incentives,&quot; which would encourage nuclear reactors to cut

corners on safety to increase production, Public Citizen believes. In addition, $20

million a year would be handed out to nuclear facilities for making investments to improve

their efficiency by a paltry 1 percent.</p>



<p>The bill also directs Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham to seek ways to subsidize the

high cost of nuclear power by any means necessary, including bestowing federal loan

guarantees, federal price guarantees and special tax considerations, and extending

taxpayer-funded insurance of the industry in case of Chernobyl-types of accidents, and by

direct federal government investment. In one example of explicit promotion of

government-subsidized nuclear energy, the bill adds $25 million to the Department of

Energy&#146;s budget to map out the design and development of new nuclear energy

facilities.</p>

<p>&quot;This measure is a lavish gift to energy corporations, once again at the

expense of taxpayers and consumers,&quot; said Public Citizen President Joan Claybrook.

&quot;We need to address our problems by taking serious conservation measures, not by

offering billions of dollars to industry.&quot;</p>

<p>Increased dependence on nuclear power will create more stockpiles of high-level

radioactive waste &#151; a problem the bill does not adequately address. For example, the

legislation offers tax credits to utilities that store nuclear waste and would commit

public dollars to research dangerous and discredited technologies for

&quot;recycling&quot; nuclear waste. </p>

<p>The oil, gas, and electric power generating industries, however, receive the

lion&#146;s share of the estimated $23 billion of taxpayer handouts. Power generators

&#151; whose profits were one the highest of any industry group last year, with

shareholder returns approaching 60 percent &#151; would receive more than $1.1 billion to

use more coal to produce electricity.</p>

<p>The bill also provides incentives for oil and gas companies to drill on federal land.

In addition to opening up the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to drilling, cash royalty

payments for drilling on public land would no longer be required, and offshore, deep-water

rigs wouldn&#146;t have to pay royalties if the price of oil falls below a certain level.

An additional $300 million would be provided to oil companies for extracting oil difficult

to reach. </p>

<p>When the numerous accounting and tax credits are taken into account, taxpayers would be

subsidizing these oil and gas companies to the tune of more than $10 billion.</p>

<p>The provisions for conservation incentives and renewable energy investments pale in

comparison to the subsidies lavished on nuclear and fossil fuels. </p>

<p>&quot;Handing taxpayer money over to energy companies won&#146;t do anything to address

America&#146;s dependence on foreign oil,&quot; said Wenonah<b> </b>Hauter, director of

Public Citizen&#146;s Critical Mass Energy and Environment Program. &quot;Even if

encouraging more drilling on public land produces a million more barrels of oil a day, it

will represent little more than 1 percent of world oil production and have no impact on

the OPEC cartel. A more sensible approach would be genuine investment in reducing demand

through energy conservation and increased investment in renewable technologies, not

renewing handouts to oil companies.&quot;
