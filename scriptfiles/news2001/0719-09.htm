- July 19 - Following a news report that the Smithsonian Institution has offered

General Motors the right to name the museum's new transportation hall

for $10 million, Ralph Nader said that Smithsonian Secretary Lawrence

Small &quot;seems to recognize no limits to the commercialization of this

historic, non-profit, taxpayer-supported institution. To let GM pay for,

be associated with and influential over a transportation exhibit, given

its decades long record of criminal convictions, buying up and

displacing mass transit systems, producing unsafe and polluting cars, is

to confess to a complete abdication of any standards of museum integrity

and independence.&quot;</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The New York Times reported today that &quot;one name under discussion&quot; by

the Smithsonian for the hall is the &quot;General Motors Hall of

Transportation.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;There should be a congressional investigation into the numerous

corporate payolas and alliances in recent years with the Smithsonian in

order to determine how to disentangle this storied Washington

institution from the tenacles of corporate commercialism,&quot; Nader said. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Nader said that Mr. Small &quot;has once again brought the Smithsonian to the

brink of turning itself into a government-funded Hall of Hucksters.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;If the Smithsonian needs money, it should come either from government

funds or from non-profit foundations with no ax to grind and no desire

for naming rights,&quot; Nader said.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;I call upon Mr. Small to reverse this reckless course of action and to

issue a bright-line policy establishing an independent, arms-length

defense against commercial interests.&quot;

	

&quot;The Smithsonian does not exist to serve as an extension of corporate

public relations departments,&quot; Nader said.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On February 27, Nader and Commercial Alert sent a letter to Mr. Small

regarding an event it conducted with K-Mart which &quot;allowed the

taxpayer-financed Smithsonian Institution to be used to prop up K-Mart

Inc. and its public relations efforts.&quot;  The letter asked Mr. Small &quot;

What limits have you set on the commercialization of the Smithsonian?

Would the Smithsonian promote corporations that are polluters? Corporate

felons? Tortfeasors? Corporate welfare recipients? Corporations that pay

no taxes?&quot;  Mr. Small did not reply to the letter.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Mr. Small has faced heavy criticism for his dealings with donors and

willingness to commercialize the Smithsonian. According to the New York

Times, &quot;In an unusual memorandum sent to the Board of Regents in May, a

majority of members of the museum's branch of the congress [of scholars]

accused Lawrence M. Small, the Smithsonian secretary, of jeopardizing

the institution's integrity with agreements he had reached with

multimillion-dollar donors.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Apparently Mr. Small doesn't understand why it is improper to turn the

Smithsonian into a GM billboard,&quot; said Gary Ruskin, executive director

of Commercial Alert.

	

Ralph Nader founded Commercial Alert to keep the commercial culture

within its proper sphere, and to prevent it from exploiting children and

subverting the higher values of family, community, environmental

integrity and democracy.</font></p>

WHAT YOU CAN DO TO HELP:

Please send email to Smithsonian Secretary Lawrence Small asking him not

to sell the naming rights to any part of the Smithsonian.  Mr. Small's

email address is &lt;smalllm@si.edu&gt;.</font></p>

Following is today's article in the New York Times.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Smithsonian Museum Close to Naming a Hall for G.M.

by Elaine Sciolino</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON, July 18 &#151; The Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of

American History has offered General Motors the right to name a new

20,000-square-foot hall of transportation in exchange for a $10 million

gift, museum officials said today.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Spencer Crew, the museum's director, emphasized that the Smithsonian had

not reached a final agreement with G.M. But he described the pending

arrangement as an appropriate and necessary way of updating the museum,

which has many exhibition halls that have not been renovated since it

opened in 1964. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;In order to do these exhibitions, one has to work with the corporate

world of donors,&quot; Dr. Crew said in a telephone interview. &quot;We're all

pretty familiar with this. It is happening everywhere in relations

between public institutions and private donors.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Asked whether General Motors would have any say in the content of the

exhibition, Dr. Crew replied, &quot;Absolutely not.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The content and preliminary design for the exhibition,&quot; he added, &quot;was

a long way in place before any fund-raising was done.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The new exhibition, whose cost is estimated at $20 million, will be

called &quot;America on the Move&quot; and will be set up in the vast existing

automobile, railroad and maritime halls and in additional space as well.

Dr. Crew said one way of crediting General Motors that was under

discussion would be to add &quot;in the General Motors Hall of

Transportation&quot; under the title. The name would remain for 30 years. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Bill Noack, a company spokesman, declined to confirm that the amount of

the gift envisioned was $10 million, but said: &quot;Certainly transportation

is a major story in American history, and the one place to tell that

story best is the Smithsonian. It's a story that G.M. is proud to help

it tell. We have an agreement in principle, and we're moving forward.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Mr. Noack added that General Motors would have &quot;zero input&quot; in the

exhibition's content.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The naming of a Smithsonian unit requires approval of the institution's

governing body, the Board of Regents, headed by Chief Justice William H.

Rehnquist. Dr. Crew said that the proposal for the arrangement with G.M.

was presented to the board last month and that he understood that the

Regents reached agreement in principle among themselves then. They will

need to &quot;do a formal recognition of it&quot; when they meet again in

September, he said.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Speculation concerning the arrangement, on which the museum began

negotiating with G.M. about six months ago, started to spread widely

among museum curators and staff members last week. That prompted Dr.

Crew to discuss it on Tuesday at a meeting of the museum's branch of the

Smithsonian- wide Congress of Scholars, a group of curators, scholars

and other researchers. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In an unusual memorandum sent to the Board of Regents in May, a majority

of members of the museum's branch of the congress accused Lawrence M.

Small, the Smithsonian secretary, of jeopardizing the institution's

integrity with agreements he had reached with multimillion-dollar

donors. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The memorandum sprang from an announcement in May of a $38 million gift

to the museum by the Catherine B. Reynolds Foundation, on condition that

it finance a hall of fame to honor American achievers. Ms. Reynolds has

made known that among her candidates are the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King

Jr., Jonas Salk, Martha Stewart and Oprah Winfrey, although the

Smithsonian will retain authority over deciding which achievers will be

included.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The pending arrangement with General Motors has added to the criticism

inside the museum of Smithsonian decisions about donor gifts. Some

curators and senior officials believe that at the very least, the naming

of a transportation exhibition hall for a major automobile company

creates an unfortunate perception problem in the minds of a public that

is the chief source of financing for the Smithsonian: the institution

gets about 70 percent of its funds, or nearly half a billion dollars

this year, from Congress. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We make it very clear we are professional historians and an exhibition

tells our story, not the sponsor's,&quot; said Barney Finn, curator of the

museum's electrical collections, who has worked with corporate donors on

exhibitions. &quot;But putting that name up on top gives the perception that

the corporation is calling the shots.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Defenders of the arrangement point to precedents within the Smithsonian

system. In 1992, the Museum of Natural History renovated its Insect Zoo

with $500,000 from the Orkin Pest Control Company and renamed it the

Smithsonian's O. Orkin Insect Zoo, for the company's founder.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Smithsonian's &quot;policy for naming opportunities&quot; states that a

corporate donor is to be &quot;encouraged&quot; to consider choosing the name of

an individual, not the corporation. Dr. Crew said that this option had

been discussed with General Motors but that the company's preference at

this stage was to use its own name.</font></p>
