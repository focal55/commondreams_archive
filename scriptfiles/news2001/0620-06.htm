- June 20 -  The Sierra Club, US Public Interest Research Group, and

the National Environmental Trust released a report by the Union of

Concerned Scientists (UCS) today which showed that higher automobile miles

per gallon standards would save consumers billions of dollars at the gas

pump. According to the report, Drilling in Detroit: Tapping Automaker

Ingenuity to Build Safe and Efficient Automobiles, it would be economically

and technically feasible for automakers to meet a standard of more than 40

miles per gallon (mpg) by 2012 and 55 mpg by 2020, nearly a 75 percent

increase compared with today's fleet.

<p>

"Making cars go further on a gallon of gasoline is a simple solution to

halting the rising gas prices and global warming pollution that we face

here," said Dan Becker, Director of the Sierra Club's Global Warming and

Energy program. "Raising auto fuel economy standards is an essential

element to a balanced energy plan that offers quicker, cleaner, cheaper and

safer energy solutions, and we are disappointed that President Bush is not

acting immediately to raise these standards."

<p>

At a time when gasoline prices are high and the science on global warming

is more compelling than ever, President Bush's energy plan focuses on

drilling for more oil in the Arctic Wildlife Refuge and other wildlands

rather than increasing the use of energy efficient technology. The U.S.

Geological Survey predicts that there is only 6 months worth of recoverable

oil from the Arctic, and it would take ten years to reach consumers.  This

small amount of oil would have no impact on the price of gas, but would

irreparably harm this pristine wilderness. On the other hand, raising miles

per gallon standards to 40 mpg for cars and light trucks would save more

oil than we get from Persian Gulf imports, the Arctic Wildlife Refuge and

California offshore oil drilling combined.

<p>

"Instead of drilling for new oil in public lands, we should tap Detroit's

ingenuity to produce cars and trucks that travel 40 miles on each gallon of

gas," said David Friedman, the lead author of the report, and a Senior

Analyst for UCS's Clean Vehicles Program.  "Using existing technologies,

automakers could build vehicles that provide relief for consumers and the

environment."

<p>

Last year, cars and light trucks accounted for more than one-fifth of U.S.

global warming pollution, with U.S. emissions amounting to more than most

countries release from all sources combined.  Scientists link global

warming to the rising frequency and severity of extreme weather events.

<p>

"The biggest single step we can take to curb global warming is to make our

cars and light trucks go further on a gallon of gas," said Becker. "It is

far past time to implement this step."

<p>

Congress has not significantly updated fuel economy standards for cars and

light trucks since 1985. And as more Americans buy Sport Utility Vehicles,

which are allowed to meet lower miles per gallon standards than cars, auto

fuel economy has decreased seven percent since 1987.  However, recent polls

indicate that 89% of the public supports mandatory increases in fuel

economy.

<p>

Findings of the report include:

* Improving standards to 40 mpg would save car owners $3000 to more than

$5000 at the gas pump over the life of a vehicle.

* Consumers would enjoy net savings of billions of dollars annually after

subtracting the projected cost the new technology would add to the sticker

price of a vehicle.

* Improving auto fuel economy standards would create 40,000 jobs in the

auto industry by 2010.

* When fully implemented in 2012, a standard of 40 mpg would avert 374

million tons of global warming pollution annually.

* When fully implemented in 2012, a standard of 40 mpg would already have

saved more oil than the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge could produce.

* Automakers could achieve higher miles per gallon standards while

maintaining or improving auto safety. This is because a more efficient

transfer of power from the engine to the wheels, which has no impact on

vehicle safety, would account for most of the increase in fuel efficiency.
