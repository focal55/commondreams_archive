Fund today called on governments gathering here for two weeks of 

global climate negotiations to finalize the Kyoto climate treaty so 

that it can become international law by next September's World 

Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD) in Johannesburg. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Marrakech talks focus on completing the translation of the 

landmark ministerial agreement on the Kyoto Protocol, achieved in 

Bonn last July, into detailed UN legal text that specifies 

precisely how each of the components of the Kyoto treaty will 

operate. The Bonn climate summit forwarded a package of decisions 

to the Marrakech conference, some already approved, and others 

requiring further work. One of the key issues for Marrakech is 

agreement on how nations will account for, report and verify their 

emissions of global warming pollution and the amounts that forests 

and land-use absorb. Though technical in nature, the provision of 

accurate data is the backbone of the climate treaty that is 

essential to ensure countries are achieving their Kyoto targets to 

limit emissions. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Government officials should finish the deal they started in 

July, by agreeing on a complete legal text for the Bonn agreement,&quot; 

said Jennifer Morgan, director of WWF's Climate Change Campaign. 

&quot;It's time governments outlined their plans for bringing the Kyoto 

climate treaty into force in the coming nine months.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WWF has prepared a detailed set of recommendations for making 

the Protocol's provisions as effective and watertight as possible. 

The recommendations refer to the operation of systems for emissions 

trading, the Clean Development Mechanism and Joint Implementation, 

sinks, measuring and monitoring emissions, compliance and allowing 

public scrutiny of projects intended to reduce emissions of global 

warming gases. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Kyoto Protocol requires industrialized countries to reduce 

emissions of six global warming gases five percent below 1990 

levels in the period 2008-2010. </font></p>
