- October 25 - The Mexico-based Human Rights Center, &quot;Miguel Agustin Pro

Juarez&quot;(PRODH), Sierra Club, Greenpeace International and the Center for

Justice and International Law today presented a petition to the

Inter-American Commission for Human Rights for violations of American

Convention on Human Rights.that the Mexican government has committed

against jailed Mexican environmentalists Rodolfo Montiel and Teodoro

Cabrera.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The petition, presented today, coincidentally comes less than a week after

the murder of prominent Mexican human rights lawyer Digna Ochoa, who was

shot to death last Friday in her office in Mexico City.  Ochoa's murderers

left behind a note threatening workers at PRODH, raising concerns for their

safety and that of all human rights and environmental activists in Mexico.

Ochoa was Montiel's and Cabrera's defense attorney after their arrest.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;This is the end of the honeymoon for the Fox government,&quot; said Alejandro

Queral, Washington Representative of the Sierra Club's International

Program. &quot;We hoped to see real change in Mexico, but his government's

failure to effectively resolve this case are sad reminders that he has not

been able to improve the situation.   For environmental and human rights

defenders, and for everyone who cares about these issues in Mexico--it

looks like the same old story.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We have exhausted every other legal recourse within Mexico,&quot; said Jorge

Fernandez, defense attorney for Montiel and Cabrera. &quot;The petition to the

Inter-American Commission is a last recourse in light of the fact that the

Mexican authorities have not had the political will to resolve this case

and have shown not to be impartial in their investigation and judgement of

this case.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Destructive and illegal logging go hand in hand with corruption and human

rights violations throughout the world,&quot; said Scott Paul, Senior Forest

Campaigner at Greenpeace.  &quot;We had hoped that this would be a thing of the

past in Mexico, but clearly it is not.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On May 2, 1999, Mr. Montiel and Mr. Cabrera were arrested by members of the

Mexican Army. During the raid, the soldiers shot and killed Salom&eacute; Sanchez

Ortiz, a local farmer.  Mr. Montiel and Mr. Cabrera were subsequently

beaten, tortured and forced to confess to charges of planting marijuana and

possession of illegal weapons.  On August 28, 2000, Montiel and Cabrera

were convicted and sentenced to six-year and eight months, and ten-year,

jail terms respectively.  All appeals within Mexico's judicial system have

been exhausted.  Amnesty International has declared the two Prisoners of

Conscience.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">PRODH, Sierra Club, Greenpeace International and the Center for Justice and

International Law believe that the arrest and conviction of the two

environmentalists stem solely from their efforts to stop the rampant

logging in the southern state of Guerrero, Mexico.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The organizations seek the involvement of the Inter-American Commission on

Human Rights because it is clear that Mexico's judicial authorities have

not been effective in imparting an impartial resolution of the case. The

legal defense of Montiel and Cabrera, carried out by attorneys at PRODH,

has appealed the Court's guilty verdict against the environmentalists by

presenting evidence that their arrests were illegal and that the signed

confessions were extracted under torture by members of the Mexican army.

The evidence includes a recommendation by Mexico's National Commission for

Human Rights and a report by Morris Tidball-Binz and Christian Tramsen,

forensic doctors working for Physicians for Human Right who examined

Montiel and Cabrera in jail.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The petition argues that Montiel and Cabrera's rights to personal liberty

and personal integrity contained in Articles 7 and 5 respectively, of the

American Convention on Human Rights, were violated by members of the

Mexican Army.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The petition also argues that the environmentalists rights  to due process

and judicial protection (Articles 8 and 25 of the Convention) were

violated.</font></p>
