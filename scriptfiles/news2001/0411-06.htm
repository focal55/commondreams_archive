- April 11 - A

                    broad coalition of religious, education, labor, civil

                    liberties and health advocacy groups today urged the U.S.

                    House to reject a bill that directs tax aid to houses of

                    worship to provide social services.</font>

                    dozen groups representing millions of Americans said the

                    &quot;charitable choice&quot; provisions of the Watts-Hall

                    &quot;Community Solutions Act&quot; (H.R. 7) must be

                    rejected. The provisions, which reflect the Bush

                    administration's &quot;faith-based&quot; initiative, allow

                    religious groups to get government funds without the

                    church-state safeguards that have been in effect in the

                    past.</font></span></font></p>

                    &quot;'Charitable choice' is an unconstitutional and

                    dangerous proposal that will harm religion, authorize

                    government-funded discrimination, undermine the

                    accountability of taxpayer dollars, foster litigation

                    against state and local governments and violate the personal

                    rights of Americans seeking help.&quot;</font></span></font></p>

                    said the Rev. Barry W. Lynn, Americans United executive

                    director. &quot;Until the plan is brought into line with the

                    Coalition's stance has broad public support. <a href="http://www.commondreams.org/news2001/0410-02.htm">A

                    poll released yesterday</a> by the Pew Forum on Religion and

                    Public Life showed that 68 percent of Americans worry that

                    faith-based programs might lead to too much government

                    involvement with religion, while six out of ten are

                    concerned that publicly funded religious groups would

                    proselytize recipients of social services. An overwhelming

                    78 percent of Americans say government-funded religious

                    groups should not be able to hire only people who share

                    their beliefs to staff programs, a key component of the Bush

                    plan.</font></span></font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><font size="2">The

                    Coalition notes that religiously affiliated groups have

                    received government funds to provide social services in the

                    past, but strict church-state safeguards were in place. The

                    Coalition asserts that these protections should not be

                    dropped, as the Bush administration proposes.</font></span></font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><font size="2">In

                    its letter to the House, the Coalition observed, &quot;For

                    decades, there has been an effective relationship between

                    government and religiously affiliated institutions for the

                    provision of community-based social services.... These

                    organizations, such as Catholic Charities, Lutheran

                    Services, United Jewish Communities and numerous others,

                    separate religious activities from their social services

                    offerings, follow all civil rights laws, follow all state

                    and local rules and standards and do not discriminate in

                    staffing. There is no reason to remove these effective

                    safeguards.&quot;</font></span></font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><font size="2">Said

                    the Coalition, &quot;'Charitable Choice' is a frontal

                    assault on the First Amendment and religious liberty, and

                    was wisely left out of the Senate companion bill, S. 592.

                    Until the dangerous 'Charitable Choice' provisions are

                    removed from H.R. 7, we ask you to oppose the Watts-Hall

                    bill.&quot;</font></span></font></p>
