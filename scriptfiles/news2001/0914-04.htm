Director of The Shalom Center and author of <I>Godwrestling -- Round 2</I>, Waskow said today: "Even the greatest oceans do not shield us; even the mightiest buildings do not shield us; even the wealthiest balance sheets and the most powerful weapons do not shield us. The lesson is that only a world where we all recognize our vulnerability can

become a world where all communities feel responsible to all other communities.

And only such a world can prevent such acts of rage and murder. If I treat my

neighbor's pain and grief as foreign, I will end up suffering when my

neighbor's pain and grief curdle into rage. This does not mean ignoring or

forgiving whoever wrought such bloodiness. They must be found and brought to

trial, without killing still more innocents. Their violence must be halted,

their rage must be calmed -- and the pain behind them must be heard and

addressed. Human beings become terrorists in a pool of despair, we must dry up

that pool of despair by replacing despair with dignity and justice in all neighborhoods

on this planet."

Assistant professor of history at North Georgia College and

State University, Sommers said today: "Colin Powell said yesterday that

Osama bin Laden is the prime suspect. If that accusation is right, this would

be what the CIA calls 'blowback' -- when what we've created blows back in our

face. The Taliban's coming to power is partly the outcome of the U.S. support

of the Mujahadeen, the radical Islamic group, in the 1980s in the war against

the Soviet Union. Blowback might erupt quickly, or simmer for decades. In

Afghanistan, we trained the fundamentalists for covert operations -- the stuff

of terrorism. After they came to power, they turned on their former benefactor,

the U.S., which had achieved the smooth flow of oil from the Middle East at a

terrible human cost. A decade of bombing and sanctions has left Saddam Hussein

in power but over 700,000 Iraqi children are dead. Palestinians live under a

brutal military occupation. When the Arabic nations try and address this matter

civilly in the UN, as they just tried last week at the Durban conference, they

are rebuffed. When blowback strikes, the consequences are as devastating as

they are tragic."

Associate professor of political science at the University

of Arizona and author of the recent articles "Afghanistan: The Soviet

Invasion in Retrospect" and "Washington's New Interventionism,"

Gibbs said today: "Bin Laden began his military career during the 1980s,

as a fighter with Muslim groups in Afghanistan that were armed and trained by

the CIA. The Taliban government of Afghanistan, which supports Bin Laden's

organization, consists of elements that also were supported by the CIA. It is

ironic that some of the alleged villains in the recent terrorist attacks may

well be products of past U.S. policies. A major problem with military

'solutions' is that they often create far more problems than they solve. The

CIA's operations in Afghanistan during the 1980s, which have helped to generate

terrorism in recent years, are spectacular examples of such policy

failures."<br>
