<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON 

- February 27 - *   George W. Bush has the lowest job approval rating given to a newly 

elected President since Dwight D. Eisenhower.  Even Richard Nixon scored higher; I wonder why?</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">*   Could it be because he's keeping his promise to govern on the platform he 

campaigned on?</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">*   That means tax cuts that only his Cabinet seem to want and drilling in 

the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge which, veritably, nobody seems to want.  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">*   If George W. Bush thinks that, under the din of Congressional 

investigations into the Rich pardon, a spy scandal, a submarine scandal, and 

bombing in Baghdad, that we won't notice the move on Alaska, he and the 

Republicans are dead wrong.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">*   The Progressive Caucus is watching and so are the American people.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">*   George W. Bush has said that he doesn't want to look back; he wants to 

look forward; and that his speech tonight is his effort to look forward.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">*   Well, if I had an environmental record like his, I'd want to look 

forward, too.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">*   And based on Texas and the Bush Cabinet, here's what we have to look forward to:  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-Increased toxic emissions (Texas led the nation in the release of 

cancer-causing chemicals, carbon dioxide, and mercury into the air);</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-Increased plunder abroad by US oil companies with their tax subsidies  and 

human rights abuses in tow;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">    -And the specter  of franken food becoming a staple in our diet without  

our knowledge.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">*   And by the way, over 30,000 Americans died last year due to exposure to 

air pollution.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">*   In response to a question about California's power crisis, George W. 

Bush's initial reaction was to rollback clean air requirements for power 

companies.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">*   Presiding over our Energy Department is Spencer Abraham who, as a 

Senator, wanted to dismantle it.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">*   Christie Todd Whitman doubts that global warming is a serious problem.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">*   Gale Norton, Secretary of the Interior, allows mining company polluters 

to escape cleanup requirements and liability because she believes that 

companies have a constitutional right to pollute.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">*   Ann Veneman served on the board of Monsanto who gave us genetically 

modified foods.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">*   And the New Attorney General has a history of blocking enforcement of 

environmental laws.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">*   And while the Bush Administration readies its chainsaw budget that rips 

our social safety net to shreds, it has produced energy legislation that 

transfers a tidy sum--about $24 Billion--to oil and energy companies.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">*   And George W. Bush, himself, stated that he wanted to double the amount 

of logging in our National Forests.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">*   From taxpayer subsidized logging to exclusive drilling rights in 

endangered wilderness, it seems that the oil and timber barons now have an 

open invitation to feed at the public trough.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">*   Senator Murkowski's bill is just the beginning of a wrong-way 

environmental package, an entire way of thinking, that puts our planet at 

risk.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">*   Unfortunately, we're all expected to pay the price.  This Administration 

has chosen environmental recklessness over real money for education and help 

for the homeless.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">*   &quot;Looking Forward&quot; as this Administration wants us to do, I envision more 

pollutants in our environment, with tax breaks to put them there.  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">*   Except for one thing: the melting snows of Kilimanjaro are the clarion 

call to people everywhere to pay attention to this Administration.  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">You can bet that we all will be listening intently tonight to Bush's 

environmental message. </font></p>
