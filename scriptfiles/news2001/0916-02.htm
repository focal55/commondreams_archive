- September 16 -  Participants of the Mobilization for

Global Justice (MGJ) are shocked and deeply saddened

by last week's terrorist attacks.  We  express our

deepest sympathies for the victims of this tragedy,

their families, friends and communities.  We

unequivocally condemn these horrific attacks, and we

call for an immediate end to the cycle of violence. 

We urge all leaders to seek justice in this situation

rather than revenge. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In this time of grief, the MGJ is postponing the

nonviolent demonstrations against the World Bank and

the International Monetary Fund (IMF) our coalition

was planning to host later this month.  We choose this

course of action regardless of the plans of the World

Bank and IMF, and we respect other organizations that

choose a different path. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">MGJ is proceeding with plans to co-sponsor the

Peoples' Summit, an educational forum and teach-in

scheduled for September 26th-28th, which will include

issues that have been brought to the forefront this

past week.  We extend our invitation for people to

come to Washington DC for the Peoples' Summit and for

the Interfaith Service for Justice and Restoration on

September 29th.  We also encourage groups working

around the world for peace and global justice to

organize teach-ins, educational events and vigils in

their own communities.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Our decision to postpone was made out of respect for

the victims of this tragedy.  However the policies of

the World Bank and the IMF remain unchanged, and the

MGJ, as part of a global movement, will continue its

efforts to hold these institutions accountable for

their role in structuring an unjust and inequitable

global economy.  Our commitment to global justice

demands no less.  The MGJ stands committed to

achieving social, racial, economic and environmental

justice, which we see as the only path to a lasting

peace.  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">During these difficult times, we call on people in the

U.S. and around the world to stand firm against all

racist persecution of Arab and Muslim peoples. 

Furthermore we oppose any opportunistic attack on our

constitutional freedoms and Americans' civil

liberties.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Despite the disheartening acts of hatred we observed

last week, we believe that another world is not only

possible,  but more necessary than ever.  </font></p>
