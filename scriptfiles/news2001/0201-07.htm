- February 1 - In one of the closest

votes on a Cabinet nominee in this century, the Senate voted

narrowly today to confirm John Ashcroft as the next Attorney

General. "The fact that so many Senators voted in opposition to

Ashcroft shows just how galvanized Americans across the country

have been around this nomination," said Vicki Saporta, executive

director of the National Abortion Federation (NAF). "In just a

few weeks, an unprecedented coalition of organizations

representing millions of Americans came together to signal to

Bush that he can not turn back the clock on the rights cherished

by so many Americans to appease a right-wing minority."

<p>"When he chose this extremist nominee, President Bush broke

his promise to be a uniter, not a divider," said Saporta.

"Americans have sent a clear message that they will be watching

George Bush and John Ashcroft over the next four years. They

have communicated unequivocally that Bush does not have a

mandate to make executive or judicial appointments that are

outside of the mainstream."

<p>Saporta continued, "As the organization representing abortion

providers and the women who seek their care, we remain deeply

concerned that Ashcroft will not vigorously uphold the law. We

pledge to closely monitor the work of the Department of Justice

under Ashcroft's leadership to ensure that the Freedom of Access

to Clinic Entrances Act and other laws are fully enforced. From

our more than 20 years of documenting trends in violence against

abortion providers, we know that when laws are enforced,

anti-choice violence decreases. Conversely, when the laws are

not enforced, violence and harassment against abortion providers

increases. We will not tolerate any increases in the level of

violence directed at those who provide safe, legal

reproductive health care services to women."

<p>"We commend those Senators who listened to the voices of

Americans across the country and rejected this nomination," said

Saporta. "At the same time, we are troubled that some Senators

who support a woman's right to choose did not do so with this

vote. We call on all Senators who supported John Ashcroft to

join us in holding him to his promise to vigorously enforce the

laws of this country. The lives of too many Americans depend on

it."

<p><i>The National Abortion Federation is the professional

association of abortion providers in the United States and

Canada dedicated to ensuring that abortion remains safe, legal

and accessible.</i>
