to Giving by Men, Study of 2000 Election Financing Finds

- October 25 - Despite the advances women have made in politics over the past

decade, the world of political contributors is still dominated

by men, according to The Big Picture, a new comprehensive study

of the money behind the 2000 elections by the non-partisan

Center for Responsive Politics.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Big Picture is the product of more than two years of

research into the funding of last year's record-breaking

elections and more than a decade's worth of tracking the funding

of federal elections in general. It is based on the Center's

data and analysis of reports filed with the Federal Election

Commission for the 1999-2000 election cycle.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The study found that total giving by women has risen along with

the price of campaigns since the early '90s, but contributions

from female donors in relation to those from male donors have

remained constant. Women accounted for about the same proportion

of money given to federal candidates and party committees in

last year's elections as they did in the 1996 and 1992

elections, the Center's study reveals. Women contributed 28

percent of all hard money given by individuals in the 1999-2000

election cycle, compared to 27 percent in 1995-96 and 26 percent

in 1991-92. Female contributors gave 15 percent of all soft

money last year, the same proportion as in 1995-96 and one

percentage point less than in 1991-92.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Why do women give a higher percentage of hard money than soft

money? Because hard money contributions are subject to limits,

and wealthy contributors who have given the maximum amount of

hard money to a candidate often write a check to that same

candidate from their spouse (and sometimes their children). Soft

money contributions have no limits, so &quot;shadow&quot; giving by

spouses is unnecessary, according to the study.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Big Picture's other findings include:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">* Geography of campaign contributions: The most generous metro

area in the country in the 2000 elections was New York city

($104.1 million to federal candidates, parties and PACs),

followed by the Washington, D.C. area ($79.8 million) and Los

Angeles/Long Beach ($57.5 million). The most Democratic-leaning

region in the country in terms of campaign giving was Lowell,

Mass., where 80.2 percent of contributions went to Democrats.

Casper, Wyo. was the most loyal Republican stronghold, with 99.0

percent of its contributions going to the GOP.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">* Spreading the wealth: Contributions from incumbents to

candidates and party committees - a necessity for any lawmaker

wanting a leadership post or plum committee assignment -

increased sharply in 2000 over 1998. For example, Democratic

candidates transferred $15.7 million to the party in 1999-2000,

more than triple the $4.6 million recorded in 1998.

Contributions from Republican candidates to the GOP went from

$12.3 million in 1998 to $19.6 million last year, an increase of

59 percent.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">* Advantages of incumbency: The cost of beating a House

incumbent last November soared to just over $2 million, nearly

double what it cost just two years earlier. The incumbents that

were defeated spent even more than their challengers - an

average of more than $2.5 million apiece.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">* Biggest bundles of Election 2000: The practice of bundling -

when a large number of individuals from the same organization

pool their donations to support a particular candidate - reached

record levels in 2000. Jon Corzine, the Democratic Senate

candidate from New Jersey, recorded the largest bundle ever for

a federal candidate - nearly $533,000 from Goldman Sachs, the

Wall Street investment firm he once led. Emily's List

contributed the second largest bundle of the election cycle -

close to $477,000 to Democratic Senate candidate Debbie

Stabenow. Both Corzine and Stabenow were victorious last

November.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Big Picture contains numerous other facts and figures from

the most expensive election in U.S. history, including:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">* Top organizational contributors, individual contributors, soft

money donors, and PACs;

* Detailed analysis of giving by the major industries and

interest groups in the U.S. economy;

* Timelines showing month-by-month fundraising by the major

presidential candidates;

* Demographic breakdowns of donors by the size of contributions

and giving patterns to each party;

* Spending levels in races in which an incumbent won, an

incumbent lost, and open seats;

* Fundraising by members of the majority party versus that of

members in the minority.</font></p>
