- February 14 - The Bush administration should develop strong radiation

protection standards for the proposed Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository to protect

the public and the environment from the dangers of radiation, a dozen consumer and

environmental groups said today. The national and Nevada-based groups, which actively

oppose the Yucca Mountain repository proposal, were joined by Nevada Gov. Kenny Guinn and

Sens. Harry Reid (D-Nev.) and John Ensign (R-Nev.) in calling attention to the radiation

protection standards used to evaluate site suitability.

<p>Yucca Mountain, located near Las Vegas, Nev., is currently the only site under

consideration for a potential dump for high-level radioactive waste generated by U.S.

commercial reactors and weapons facilities. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)

is required by the Nuclear Waste Policy Act to set radiation protection standards for the

site. The agency released a proposed rule for comment in 1999. The Nuclear Regulatory

Commission and Department of Energy (DOE) commented in favor of weaker standards, and a

final rule has not yet been issued. The standard now falls to the new administration to

issue in final form.</p>



<p>We urge the Bush administration to support a standard that at a minimum ensures:



<ul>

  <li>exposure limits<i> at least </i>equivalent to the EPA's generic radioactive waste

    disposal standard, in terms of annual dose to the most vulnerable persons (e.g. fetuses,

    children, the elderly);</li>

  <li>groundwater protection consistent with the Safe Drinking Water Act;</li>

  <li>a regulatory timeframe that covers the entire period the material would be dangerously

    radioactive; and,</li>

  <li>compliance at the boundary of the repository so as to not allow for a buffer zone.</li>

</ul>



<p>While campaigning in Nevada last fall, President Bush and Vice-President Cheney

promised to base a decision about the contentious Yucca Mountain proposal on sound

science. The new administration has an early opportunity to demonstrate its commitment to

this pledge by establishing a radiation protection rule that requires radioactive waste to

be isolated from people and the environment. More lenient standards would threaten public

health and promote a reliance on merely dilution -- rather than containment -- of nuclear

waste to meet regulatory requirements. This would be a travesty of the scientific concept

undergirding the proposal for a geologic repository, the groups said. </p>



<p>The DOE is expected later this year to recommend the Yucca Mountain site for

development as a permanent repository for 77,000 tons of high-level radioactive waste. A

favorable recommendation is contingent on an assessment of whether a Yucca Mountain

repository could meet EPA radiation protection standards. </p>



<p>Radiation standards are of critical importance for public health and environmental

protection - quite literally a matter of life and death. Therefore, on behalf of their

combined memberships across the country, the following organizations urge the Bush

administration to live up to its campaign promises by establishing strong radiation

protection standards for the proposed Yucca Mountain repository: Alliance for Nuclear

Accountability (ANA), Nuclear Information and Resource Service (NIRS), Public Citizen,

Sierra Club, U.S. Public Interest Research Group (U.S. PIRG), Women's Action for New

Directions (WAND), Women's Legislative Lobby (WiLL), Citizen Alert, Healing Ourselves and

Mother Earth (HOME), Nevada Desert Experience, Nevada Nuclear Waste Taskforce, Toiyabe

(Nevada Chapter) Sierra Club.</p>



<p>Bipartisan political leadership in Nevada shared the concerns of these groups.</p>



<p>&quot;Last year, it required a presidential veto to stop efforts to strip away the role

of the EPA in establishing radiation standards for Yucca Mountain, and I would hope the

new administration will pledge to do the same if required,&quot; said Sen. Reid.

&quot;During her confirmation hearing I received an assurance from EPA administrator

Christie Todd Whitman that her agency would continue to set radiation standards for Yucca

Mountain. The Bush administration must honor that commitment to protect the health and

safety of Nevadans by requiring a stringent radiation standard, not one which is supported

by the greedy nuclear power industry.&quot;</p>



<p>Nevada&#146;s governor, Guinn, has received promises from President Bush that radiation

protection standards would not be lowered or transferred to another agency. The state

continues to insist that Nevadans are entitled to the same level of radiation protection

as other Americans and that standards for a Yucca Mountain repository cannot be more

lenient than those governing the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) in New Mexico. </p>



<p>Added Sen. Ensign, &quot;I welcome this call for the strongest possible radiation

protection standards when it comes to the proposed Yucca Mountain nuclear waste

repository. I have every confidence this administration will follow through on promises

made during the campaign, to let the Environmental Protection Agency set those standards.

If sound science truly governs this process, then nuclear waste will not be dumped in

Nevadans&#146; backyard in the first place.&quot;</p>



<p>In conjunction with other groups in Nevada, Citizen Alert has prepared a detailed

position paper on the proposed EPA radiation standards from a Nevada perspective, which

will be ready for release within the next 10 days.</p>
