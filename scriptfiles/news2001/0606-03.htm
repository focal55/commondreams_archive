- June 6 - At the first Senate 

hearing on the controversial &quot;charitable choice&quot; provision, The 

Interfaith Alliance (TIA) submitted testimony calling upon senators 

to protect the religious freedom of those seeking government 

services, to prevent taxpayer funded religious discrimination, and 

to uphold the integrity of religious autonomy by eliminating the 

faith-based solutions component of the Drug Abuse Education, 

Prevention, and Treatment Act of 2001, S. 304, found in Section 701 

titled &quot;Assistance by Religious Organizations Under Government 

Programs Funded Under This Act.&quot; </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Today's public hearing marks the first opportunity for Senate 

Judiciary Committee members to hear concerns and examine the 

far-reaching implications of government funding pervasively 

religious ministries,&quot; said the Rev. Dr. C. Welton Gaddy, executive 

director of TIA. &quot;We will learn from the questions whether 

lawmakers in the Senate understand the proper relationship between 

religion and government in arguably the most religiously diverse 

nation in the world.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Yesterday at a Habitat for Humanity building site in Florida, 

President Bush continued his ongoing campaign to build public 

support for his faith-based initiatives, calling for the expansion 

of &quot;charitable choice&quot; legislation. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;It is unfortunate that the president in promoting his 

faith-based initiatives has confused the fundamental difference 

between non-financial partnerships and contractual employment that 

comes with rules, regulations and risks,&quot; said the Rev. Gaddy. &quot;I 

hope and pray that the Senate Judiciary Committee will resist the 

political temptation to obscure the real consequences of government 

funding pervasively religious programs.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Follwing are excerpts from the testimony submitted by The 

Interfaith Alliance to the Senate Judiciary Committee: </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;In no uncertain terms, we believe that this legislation raises 

serious concerns about the prophetic voice of faith, the integrity 

of religious autonomy, excessive government entanglement in the 

affairs of religious institutions, and the overarching temptation 

to abuse religion and manipulate faith to achieve political 

power.... </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Whenever elected leaders craft public policy that impacts the 

relationship between the institutions of religion and government, 

the potential for equating a policy position with a litmus test of 

faith, is a real concern. Unfortunately, that concern often leads 

to silence as public officials fear being unfairly labeled by those 

who promote an agenda that endangers religious liberty and 

tolerance. In the face of uncivil attacks, we ask Senators to 

demonstrate courage and protect the religious liberty of all people 

of faith and goodwill.... </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;While it is well-intentioned, we believe this 'charitable 

choice' legislation is severely misguided....The Interfaith 

Alliance is opposed to so-called 'charitable choice' provisions 

because we believe this legislation raises serious issues that can 

irreparably harm religious life in America.... </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The Interfaith Alliance does believe that religion and 

government can, and should, work together. There is no debate among 

us about the ability of faith to have an impact on and create 

change in our nation. The controversy arises around strikingly 

different opinions on the government's responsibility to fully fund 

efforts to serve those in need. We believe the reasonable 

compromise between pervasively religious ministries receiving 

government funds for which the president and supporters of 

'charitable choice' are calling, and religious ministries and 

organizations receiving no funds at all, is embracing and enhancing 

the current levels of partnership which exist already. This will 

facilitate the organization of houses of worship and religious 

ministries under today's statutes and protections.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Since the 2000 presidential campaign, TIA has voiced concerns 

about &quot;charitable choice&quot; legislation. In an effort to educate 

local religious and civic leaders about the dangers of government 

funding religion and the potential for civil rights violations 

against those in need, TIA launched a grassroots campaign to host 

public forums, bringing together local community leaders to discuss 

the implications of &quot;charitable choice&quot; and President Bush's 

faith-based initiatives. Forums have already taken place in 

Oklahoma, Kansas, Missouri, Florida and Virginia, with others 

scheduled in the future. To obtain information about this 

grassroots effort and transcripts from events, contact the 

Communications Department at 202-639-6370. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To increase understanding among religious leaders about the 

ethical and legal ramifications of becoming government contractors, 

The Interfaith Alliance Foundation and the Baptist Joint Committee 

on Public Affairs published Keeping the Faith: The Promise of 

Cooperation, The Perils of Government Funding: A Guide for Houses 

of Worship. This 15-page, easy-to-read guide has been distributed 

to more than 30,000 religious leaders and houses of worship 

throughout the country. To obtain a free copy of this booklet, 

please contact the Religious Outreach Department at 202-639-6370.
