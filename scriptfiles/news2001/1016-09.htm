- October 16 -   The unconditional flow of weapons and other military equipment

and expertise to the warring parties in Afghanistan will lead to

further human rights abuses and war crimes, Amnesty International

said today in a briefing on such transfers.</font>

<p>     <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;To date, both the Taleban and the Northern Alliance have

been heavily armed by foreign governments regardless of their

appalling human rights records,&quot; the organization said.</font></p>

<p>     <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;While the shifting of arms is inevitable in a conflict

situation, it is crucial that further transfers of arms and

expertise are rigorously controlled.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">     Amnesty International is calling for independent monitors

to be put in place to verify that commanders who have been

responsible for gross human rights abuses in the past are removed

before any transfers take place.  The monitors should remain in

place to ensure that the arms and expertise are not used to

commit human rights abuses.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">     During the 1980s and 1990s, arms and related supplies

were sent from the USA and some of its West European allies, as

well as the former Soviet Union, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and Iran,

and were used for perpetuating massive human rights abuses by

various armed groups in Afghanistan.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">     Civilians in Afghanistan are suffering the legacy of

these uncontrolled transfers, thousands have died from

anti-personnel landmines alone.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">     Since 1994, the main supplies of arms and related items

to the Taleban have come from official stocks in Pakistan or from

Chinese or other sales through private dealers based in Pakistan

and with private funding from Saudi Arabia.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">     Recent supplies to the Northern Alliance have been

reportedly sent from Iran and the Russian Federation via the

Central Asian states, especially Tajikistan, as well as from the

Slovak Republic, although the Central Asian states have denied

their involvement.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">     Amnesty International is concerned that the Russian

government is reportedly planning deliveries of up to $45 million

worth of arms to the Northern Alliance which are not conditioned

to any human rights criteria.  Furthermore the US Congress is

currently considering a law to provide up to $300 million of

direct military assistance to &quot;eligible Afghan resistance

organizations&quot;.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">     Amnesty International also urges all governments to

refrain from the use of cluster bombs near civilian areas, from

using depleted uranium weapons whose effects are not fully known,

and to refrain from providing such weapons to any of those

involved in the conflict.</font></p>
