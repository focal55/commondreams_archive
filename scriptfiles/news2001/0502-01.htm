- May 2 - The National Council of

Women's Organizations (NCWO), the oldest and largest umbrella

coalition of the nation's major women's groups, urges the new Social

Security Commission to listen to the public's concerns about

privatizing the nation's most important safety net for retirees, the

disabled and their survivors.

<p>"President Bush's support for Individual Accounts carved out of

Social Security jeopardizes the guarantee of lifetime,

inflation-adjusted benefits that Social Security now provides," said

Martha Burk, Ph.D., chair of NCWO. "Public support for privatization

has declined as Americans have seen the value of their pensions and

401(k) plans plummet in recent months, according to three recent

national public opinion polls widely covered by the media. Yet,

President Bush's selections for the commission fail to reflect the

erosion in support for his plan."

<p>"Social Security is the one piece of retirement income that should

be guaranteed and not linked to the uncertainties of the stock

market," adds Burk. "You might make good investment decisions but

what will happen to your grandmother or mother-in-law if they don't."

<p>"Most workers will face cuts in guaranteed benefits that are not

made up by income from an individual account," according to Heidi

Hartmann, Ph.D., president of the Institute for Women's Policy

Research and chair of the NCWO Women and Social Security Project.

"If privatizers keep their promises to current retirees, younger

workers will get less when they retire."

<p>"The majority of the more than 120 organizations in NCWO and six

million women they represent are extremely concerned about Social

Security privatization," added Burk.

<p><i>The National Council of Women's Organization's (NCWO) is a

nonpartisan, nonprofit coalition of more than 120 women's

organizations across the nation collectively representing over six

million women. For years, NCWO has convened the leadership of major

women's organizations dedicated to focusing on national issues and

public policy agendas affecting women. In 1998, NCWO formed the Women

&amp; Social Security Project and launched a national education campaign

to highlight Social Security's importance to women.
