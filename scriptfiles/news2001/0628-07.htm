- June 28 - The Sierra Club dismissed President Bush's energy

efficiency photo-op today as another attempt to confuse the public about

the real focus of his energy plan.   While the President might be touring

examples of the kinds of energy efficiency we need, the core of the energy

plan he is submitting to Congress today depends on increased use of

unreliable, unsafe and expensive fossil fuels and nuclear energy.   Today's

announcement by President Bush simply restores funding for renewable energy

to the levels in place before the President recommended cuts.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The President seems fixated on vampires, but he's ignoring the monster

trucks that guzzle our gasoline and driving a stake through the heart of

the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge,&quot; said Carl Pope, Executive Director of

the Sierra Club.  &quot;The technology exists to build cars and SUVs that go

further on a gallon of gas.  But instead of telling Detroit to get the

technology off their shelves and into engines, the President is dragging

his feet.  Rather than steering us to energy independence, the President

refuses to make gas guzzling a thing of the past.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;President Bush is trying to distract attention away from his overall

energy plan, which drills, digs, destroys and pollutes, but doesn't solve

our energy needs,&quot; Pope continued.  &quot;As he submits his plan to Congress, it

would be more honest for President Bush to stand in front of old, dirty

power plants or gas-guzzling SUVs.  The President's plan means more

pollution, more global warming, and fewer wild places for our families to

explore and enjoy.  Instead, Americans want a balanced energy plan that

gives us quicker, cleaner, cheaper and safer energy solutions. We can have

clean energy and a healthy environment.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">While promoting funding for renewable energy is laudable, the Bush energy

plan still focuses too heavily on the wrong choices--to produce more coal,

oil, gas, and nuclear power--with insufficient emphasis on energy

efficiency and cleaner alternatives.  And although the fuel-cell technology

the President viewed today will reduce our dependence on fossil fuels that

cause global warming in the future, we could be working on that goal right

now by increasing fuel economy for all cars and light trucks.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">President Bush's Energy Plan recognizes that fuel economy has fallen to a

20-year low, yet calls for a study, not action. Raising fuel economy

standards to 40 miles per gallon would save Americans money and slash the

amount of carbon pollution emitted from cars and light trucks, which

contributes to global warming. With today's technologies more efficient

engines, transmissions, hybrid gasoline-electric systems, and better

aerodynamics the automakers could make cars and light trucks that go

further on a gallon of gas. Congress set the current 27.5 mpg fuel economy

standard for cars in 1975 and has not changed the standard since.</font></p>

<p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The biggest single step we can take to curb global warming and save

energy is to make all cars and light trucks go further on a gallon of gas,&quot;

continued Pope. &quot;If we were making the right choices for increased

efficiency, conservation and renewable energy, we wouldn't need the extra

oil rigs and power plants President Bush proposes.&quot;
