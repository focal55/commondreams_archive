- July 20 - Federal officials 

here today will complete their round of four public hearings aimed 

at reviewing a critical provision of the Clean Air Act called New 

Source Review. At issue is President Bush's attempt to weaken the 

Clean Air Act to facilitate his call for increased fossil fuel 

production and refinery capacity. Senior EPA and other federal 

officials yesterday completed a tour of refinery facilities and 

communities in Texas and Louisiana, sponsored by community 

activists and environmental organizations and hosted by 

Earthjustice. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Yesterday we got to show some of the decision makers what the 

impacts of their decisions are by exposing them for just a short 

period of time to what local folks are exposed to every minute of 

every day in these communities,&quot; said Nathalie Walker of 

Earthjustice's New Orleans office. &quot;Today, they are hearing 

firsthand from the folks who live and work in these areas how 

vitally important Clean Air Act rules are and how the poisonous 

pollution coming from these facilities is literally killing them 

and their families. It's one thing to make a decision from behind 

a desk in Washington, D.C. It's quite another to see in-person 

what we're talking about.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At a press conference and rally today, local citizens and 

environmental leaders detailed the dangers from refinery operations 

and the health problems that affect the communities surrounding 

them. Mossville, a southwestern Louisiana community, has no less 

than 17 industrial facilities operating within one-half mile of its 

African-American residents. &quot;It's good that EPA and the Department 

of Energy are having these meetings, but it will mean something 

only if they listen to the people who have taken the time to come 

and speak,&quot; said Edgar Mouton, Jr., president of Mossville 

Environmental Action Now. &quot;If they're just going through the 

motions to appear impartial, then all Americans should be 

outraged.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In his energy plan, President Bush directed EPA Administrator 

Christine Todd Whitman to review the Clean Air Act's New Source 

Review program, a vital component of the Act that regulates new 

pollution emissions. The New Source Review program requires both 

new and existing facilities to reduce the kinds of pollution that 

can trigger asthma attacks and other serious health problems. 

Before an older facility makes a major modification that results in 

pollution increases, New Source Review requires that facility to 

install modern pollution control technology. The EPA has reported 

that 80 percent of all oil refineries in the nation are in 

violation of the New Source Review program. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;These hearings and their outcomes and the decisions made will 

have lasting effects on people all across the country -- not just 

in Louisiana,&quot; said Walker. &quot;From the northeast to California and 

back to Texas and the southeast, these refineries and power plants 

are spewing high levels of pollution that need to be significantly 

reduced, certainly not increased.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Hazardous air pollutants emitted by oil refineries include 

benzene, a known human carcinogen. According to the US Department 

of Justice and the EPA, the failure of power plants to install new 

emission controls results in tens of millions of tons of sulfur 

dioxide and particulate matter being emitted into the air. In 

Mossville for example, industry spews nearly 50,000 tons of sulfur 

dioxide into the air each year. Sulfur dioxide is known to trigger 

asthma attacks and it contributes to the growing number of children 

and adults suffering from this respiratory disease. Fine particle 

pollution emitted from refineries is responsible for more than 

60,000 premature deaths each year in the United States. </font></p>
