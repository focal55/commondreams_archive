- September 11 - The Education for Peace in Iraq Center (EPIC) today condemned the

terrorist 

attacks in New York and Washington.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We are deeply shaken by the unimaginable tragedies that took place this </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">morning.&quot; EPIC Director Erik Gustafson continued, &quot;We await reports of 

casualties with great trepidation, and we join with others in offering

our 

deepest condolences to the families and communities who have lost loved 

ones.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Speaking from Washington, Gustafson expressed concern about reports of

bomb 

threats against faith communities and non-governmental organizations

(NGOs) 

in Washington. &quot;It is essential for all of us to recognize that

terrorists 

do not represent, nor are representative, of any community. We cannot

allow 

terrorism the power to create fear, suspicion and hatred. We must

overcome 

this attack and not let it justify further violence. Now is a time for

us to 

support each other with faith and trust.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In a statement released today, EPIC cited the 1998 mistaken attack on

the Al 

Shifa pharmaceutical plant in Sudan and expressed hopes for restraint.

The 

statement read in part: &quot;As an organization that has become intimately 

knowledgeable of the horrific costs of war and violence, EPIC calls on

U.S. 

officials to proceed with caution and not violently rush toward

vengeance, 

but rather seek justice through peaceful and diplomatic means. It is our </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">hope that those responsible will be found and prosecuted. We must all

work 

to realize a world where violent attacks on civilians stop.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Ibrahim Ramey of the Muslim Peace Fellowship and the Fellowship of 

Reconciliation (FOR) returned early this morning from the Racism

Conference 

in South Africa. His flight landed this morning in Newark.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Speaking from New York, Ibrahim said, &quot;The tragic and unwarranted attack

on 

civilians by terrorists signals a need for all parties to stop the use

of 

violence. The individuals who carried out these attacks were operating 

outside moral law. Violence is destructive and counter-productive in any </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">context of peace and justice-making, and can never be justified. I 

personally call upon the U.S. government and civil society to show 

restraint, particularly when all the facts are not known.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">EPIC encourages all people of faith and conscience to redouble efforts

to 

foster a more peaceful, beloved world.  In the face of such violence,

voices 

of peace become all the more important. Please write and call newspapers

and 

elected officials and implore restraint. To donate blood, call 

1-800-GIVE-LIFE.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Churches, synagogues and mosques around the country are open for prayer, with some scheduling special services for this evening.  In Washington,

DC, 

an emergency meeting among peace and justice organizations will be held

7 

pm, tomorrow (September 12) at All Souls Church (16th &amp; Harvard St. NW).</font></p>
