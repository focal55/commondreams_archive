- January 30 - In response to President George W. Bush's legislative proposals to fund religious ministries, interfaith leaders around the nation raised concerns about the harm that can be done to religious ministries if Bush's legislative proposals redirect billions of federal dollars earmarked for existing social services to religious organizations.   



<p>Clergy from across the ideological spectrum are raising concerns about the integrity of religious autonomy, the prophetic voice of faith, excessive government entanglement in the affairs of religious institutions, and the overarching temptation to abuse religion and manipulate faith to achieve political power. 



<p>"Tax dollars come with strings that will effectively turn religious leaders into government puppets.  Take away the strings and you take away the accountability which opens the door to lawsuits," said the Rev. Dr. C. Welton Gaddy, executive director of The Interfaith Alliance.  



<p>Religious leaders with The Interfaith Alliance (TIA), a grassroots faith-based organization dedicated to promoting the positive and healing role of religion in public life, questioned Bush's plan to infuse religious charities with billions of tax dollars and government regulations.  Concerned with the immediate impact on the autonomy of religious ministries to remain faithful to their missions, TIA challenged the notion that this program is a true partnership. 



<p>"President Bush's plan to subsidize religious charities is not a partnership, it is contractual employment with rules, regulations and risks.  'Buyer Beware' should be posted on the door of this White House Office.  This multi-billion dollar proposal will not allocate new monies to deal with poverty; instead it will turn our nation's religious leaders into competitors for a limited pool of money, inevitably placing the bulk of responsibility for the nation's disadvantaged on the already burdened shoulders of the faith community," said Gaddy.



<p>Yesterday's announcement of the newly established White House Office of Faith-Based and Community Initiatives sent a shock wave of concern through religious communities across the nation.  Faith leaders from across the ideological and faith spectrum are raising questions about Bush's understanding of the uniquely religious nature of charities, his comprehension of the vast religious pluralism in our nation, and his commitment to protecting religious minorities and others from discrimination in the funding process and in the receipt of services.   



<p>"With more than 2000 religious traditions practiced in the United States, President Bush has yet to offer a plan that will demonstrate how political appointees will award money in an equitable manner. If different faith charities representing widely differing religious groups proffer the same results, who decides which religion deserves funding and who should be excluded?" asked the Rev. Michael Carrier, president of The Interfaith Alliance of Colorado and pastor of Calvary Presbyterian Church in Denver. 	



<p>Religious leaders are also raising concerns about the impact federal funds would have on the ability of religious institutions to hire and employ staff or run programs that integrate fundamental religious beliefs into every aspect of a social service program.  In his speech unveiling the initiative, the president's remarks created confusion about whether charities that integrate religion into every aspect of their work would be required to separate the religious message and program from the delivery of social services.  



<p>"Would federally funded religious charities be required to abandon their religious teachings in some instances and comply with employment and civil rights laws that prevent hiring discrimination based on race, religion, nation origin, gender, or sexual orientation?" asked Rabbi Sidney Vineburg, co-chair of the Northeast Wisconsin Interfaith Alliance in Green Bay.  "As religious people, we know that while faith can have the power to heal, religion can also be used to exclude, demonize and discriminate.  The government should not be in the business of financing that exclusion."



<p>Under current laws, many religious groups create separate organizations that neither promote religion nor discriminate in hiring to compete for federal funding, such as Catholic Charities or the Lutheran Social Services agencies.  President Bush has proposed eliminating that "barrier" to applying for funding, raising serious questions about accountability and standards.  



<p>During his speeches, Bush offered little clarity on the matter.  While he stated that the government "will not fund religious activities of any group," he went on to say "faith-based charities should be able to compete for funding on an equal basis, and in a manner that does not cause them to sacrifice their mission."  



<p>Noting the contradictions, Rev. Gaddy stated that the "president cannot have it both ways."



<p>Curious questions abound: What happens when the mission of a Christian faith-based group dealing with poverty includes promoting the Gospel and bringing individuals to Jesus? What if a Muslim faith-based charity believes that the only way to effectively combat alcohol or drug addiction requires accepting Islam?  Will a Christian Prison Fellowship that uses the Bible to promote literacy among inmates be asked to find another book to use to teach inmates to read?  



<p>"There are numerous questions about how this federal initiative will treat religious groups and whether it is even possible to claim a commitment to equity.  After all, religion is not a generic idea and the substance of each faith is very specific," noted Gaddy.  "There is a big difference between Evangelical Christianity and Hinduism or The Church of Scientology and Buddhism.  In a politically charged environment like the White House, religious minorities from unknown or ridiculed faith traditions that could spark controversy are highly unlikely to receive federal support."  



<p>"This proposal, albeit outlined with the right intention, opens the door for the abuse of religion and political power.  Ultimately, there can be no effective guarantee enforcing fairness because the decision-making process will be inherently subjective - reflecting both bias and preference," said the Rev. Gaddy.



<p>TIA will begin convening a series of community meetings across the nation to educate and engage religious leaders in a national dialogue on the role for religion in providing social services.  TIA will continue to monitor and offer perspective and analysis on the potential impact of President Bush's initiative on the work and integrity of the diverse faith communities of our nation.
