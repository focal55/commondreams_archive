Mian is co-editor of the book <I>Out of the Nuclear Shadow</I> and a researcher on South Asian security issues with the Program on Science and Global Security at Princeton

University's Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs. He said

today: "The first and most immediate task is ensuring Pakistan's

stability: The longer the U.S. bombs Afghanistan, the more civilians get killed

and the greater the refugee crisis, the more unstable the situation becomes.

The second task is to cool tensions between India and Pakistan, as India pushes

for action against Pakistani-supported radical Islamic groups fighting in

Indian-occupied Kashmir. Third, the U.S. is lifting economic and military

sanctions it imposed against India and Pakistan after their May 1998 nuclear

tests, but it must ensure that there is no military build-up in the region.

Otherwise, we shall jump out of the frying pan of terrorism and into the fire

of a South Asian nuclear confrontation. Fourth, General Musharraf should not be

allowed to use the current crisis to delay the elections and restoration of

democratic government scheduled for next year."

Truman, one of the nation's foremost authorities on nuclear weapons policy, is author of the

article "India -- Villain, Hero, or Scapegoat?" and director of the

Downwinders organization. He said today: "Pakistan, the newest member of

the nuclear weapons club, has approximately 30 nuclear weapons. Should the

government of Pakistan fall as a result of its support of the U.S. strikes

against Afghanistan -- and should it be replaced with pro-Taliban forces --

where will those weapons end up? By removing sanctions against India and

Pakistan for developing nuclear weapons in return for support of our strikes

against Afghanistan, we are junking the entire concept of opposition to nuclear

proliferation."

Cabasso is executive director of the Western States Legal Foundation, which just released the report "Nuclear Weapons in a Changed World: The Hidden Dangers of the Rush to

War" and a report earlier this year titled "Looking for New Ways to

Use Nuclear Weapons." She said today: "The Bush administration has

indicated that it intends a long war, and has hinted that it may attack other

countries that it believes 'harbor terrorists.' Such a wider war could involve,

directly or indirectly, Israel, the U.S., Pakistan, India, the U.K. and Russia

-- six of the eight countries known to have nuclear arms. U.S. officials

already have explicitly refused to rule out the use of nuclear weapons in the

current conflict. If the war continues to escalate, the U.S. government might

ultimately use low-yield nuclear weapons, such as earth-penetrators to destroy mountain

caves. These are billed as being 'clean' weapons but would potentially spew

radioactive dirt over hundreds of miles and would cross a historical nuclear

threshold." Lichterman is program director at the Western States Legal

Foundation.
