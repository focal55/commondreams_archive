- January 9 - George Bush continues to rub salt in the wounds of American voters who

supported Al Gore, the winner of the popular vote for President. Remember

soccer moms, moderation, the center, the suburbs? Those of us who opposed

Governor Bush were aware of the National Rifle Association’s boast that if

he won they would have an office in the White House. But no one could have

imagined that the NRA’s cozy new home would be the office of the United

States Attorney General.



<p>Bush’s nominee for the office of the nation’s chief law enforcement official

is John Ashcroft. The recently defeated Missouri Senator’s

ultra-conservative credentials would lead someone hearing President-elect

Bush’s ‘uniter not divider’ rhetoric to scratch their heads. Ashcroft’s

single-minded and dogged fight to ensure that African American Judge Ronnie

White not be confirmed as a District Court Judge, as well as his devotion to

such causes as the segregationist Bob Jones University and the

neo-Confederate Southern Partisan Magazine would give anyone pause. But his

slavish devotion to the National Rifle Association — including recording ads

for the NRA endorsing a doomed law that would have granted child molesters

and stalkers the right to carry concealed weapons — is what particularly

concerns Physicians for Social Responsibility and its 22,000 members

nationwide.



<p>Ashcroft’s commitment to ensuring freedom for weapons was a major factor in

his departure from the Senate and underscores the growing tide of opinion

against the NRA. He lost the election to the late Mel Carnahan despite

receiving independent expenditures (issue advertising support) totaling

nearly $340,000 from the NRA. Even worse, the radio spots Ashcroft

personally recorded for the NRA were part of a $4 million blitz the pro-gun

group assembled to ensure the right of almost every variety of felon to

carry a concealed weapon. That piece of legislation would have represented

the capstone of Ashcroft’s long Missouri career serving the National Rifle

Association.



<p>Ashcroft’s NRA legacy scars Missouri to this day. Ashcroft served as the

state’s Attorney General and then Governor from 1976 to 1985. The result?

Missouri now ranks 15th in the nation for the weakest gun control laws,

observing only the few common-sense gun regulations which came to the state

as Federal law. Women suffer particularly in Ashcroft’s armed Missouri — 50%

of all female homicide victims die from firearms. And a well-armed Missouri

has contributed to another grim statistic: the lion’s share of gun deaths in

the state are suicides; a tribute, numerous health studies show, to the

risks of having guns in the home.



<p>As a Senator, Ashcroft continued to ignore the undeniable epidemic of gun

injuries and deaths in America. Ignoring the nearly 800 gun deaths in his

home state and over 30,000 gun deaths nationwide, Ashcroft cast vote after

vote — against closing the gun show loophole, against punishing adults who

make it easy for kids to get their hands on guns — in line with the NRA and

the gun lobby.



<p>Other citizens will rightly oppose the Ashcroft nomination because of his

links to racial extremists, his disregard for Federal law protecting

reproductive rights. But physicians also will not support an activist from

the extremist NRA as America’s top cop. Mr. Bush, check your guns and the

Ashcroft nomination at the White House door.
