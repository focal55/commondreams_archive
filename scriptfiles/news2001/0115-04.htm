- January 15 - The following was released

today by Friends of the Earth:

<p>-- Testimony of Dr. Brent Blackwelder, president, Friends of the

Earth, Before the Senate Committee on the Judiciary on the Nomination

of Senator John Ashcroft for United States Attorney General

<p>January 12, 2001

<p>Friends of the Earth is a global environmental advocacy

organization with offices in 54 countries. On their behalf, and on

behalf of our thousands of members throughout the United States, I

appreciate the opportunity to submit testimony on the nomination of

former Senator John Ashcroft as United States Attorney General.

Friends of the Earth strongly opposes confirmation of John Ashcroft

as United States Attorney General because of potential harm to both

the environment and the federal laws designed to protect it.

<p>The Attorney General, as head of the Department of Justice (DOJ)

and chief law enforcement officer of the federal government, has

sweeping discretionary authority to uphold and defend our nation's

environmental laws. DOJ's Environment and Natural Resources Division

(ENRD), in particular, has the responsibility to engage in litigation

concerning the protection, use and development of the nation's

natural resources and public lands, wildlife protection, cleanup of

hazardous waste sites, and defense of environmental challenges to

government programs and activities.

<p>The Energy and Natural Resources Division of the Department of

Justice currently harbors 691 authorized positions and operates on

an

annual budget of about $91.5 million -- 88 percent growth from 1989.

From 1994-1997, U.S Attorneys initiated investigations of an average

of 946 individuals and organizations suspected of an environmental

offense. Of those, an average of 462 was charged with criminal

violations. Coupled with a workload that includes an average of

211 civil violations and over 600 citizen suits filed, ENRD

is vested with the considerable task of serving as "the nation's

environmental lawyer, and the largest environmental law firm

in the country."

<p>As a senator for the state of Missouri, John Ashcroft had a

consistent record of promoting the interests of polluters over

citizens' rights and supporting attempts to weaken or roll back

federal environmental protections. To place the discretion of

enforcement and the responsibility of leading the nation's largest

environmental law firm squarely in the hands of someone with a long

record of opposing the laws he will be sworn to uphold would be a

grave mistake.

<p>John Ashcroft's anti-environmental record is clear. The following

are but a few examples from a career of flagrant opposition to

environmental protection:

<p>Derailing Environmental Protection Laws

<p>-- In the 106th Congress, Senator Ashcroft was one of only six

senators to cosponsor a bill that would have drastically weakened the

Clean Air Act by taking away one of the most critical enforcement

tools for states that fail to meet clean air requirements --

sanctions on federal highway aid (see: S. 495, To amend the Clean Air

Act to repeal the highway sanctions, 106th Congress, 1st Session).

Senator Ashcroft's hard stance on the Clean Air Act comes at a time

when industries are challenging current soot and smog standards in

the U.S. Supreme Court. With a growing number of regions that have

chronically dangerous smog levels, the importance of protecting the

Clean Air Act for public health and the environment is apparent.

<p>-- In the 105th Congress, Senator Ashcroft voted against a

filibuster of a bill that would have weakened land use protections

by

amending most federal environmental laws and allowing polluters to

newly challenge federal environmental protections. The bill also

would have overridden existing local procedures to allow developers

to challenge city and county zoning laws directly in federal courts

instead of existing local administrative appeals and state courts

(see: Roll Call Vote No. 197, July 13, 1998). So called "takings"

bills such as this would undermine local control over land uses in

the name of protecting the property rights of the few, and have been

opposed environmental groups, the federal and state judiciary, and

forty-one state attorneys general, among others.

<p>-- Also in the 104th Congress, Senator Ashcroft voted to build on

the infamous "salvaged timber rider" by extending indefinitely the

time for old growth timber sales directed by this provision. The

rider, attached to the 1995 Budget Rescissions Act, allows timber

companies to purchase and log parcels in our national forests without

regard to federal environmental laws (see: Roll Call Vote No. 33,

March 14, 1996). These riders have had the effect of ravaging old

growth and healthy trees under the guise of "salvaging" dead or

diseased timber while destroying wildlife habitat and degrading water

quality in streams and rivers.

<p>Protecting Polluters over People

<p>-- In 1995, Senator Ashcroft defended a sweeping bill (S. 343, the

Comprehensive Regulatory Reform Act of 1995) that would have undercut

legal safeguards for environmental, human health, consumer and labor

protections (see: Roll Call Vote No. 315, July 20). This bill, and

other so-called "regulatory reform" bills like it, would create

avenues of legal maneuvering for businesses to eliminate, stall, or

revise safeguards. Such proposals that are clearly designed for the

sake of industries would also leave the public with no recourse

against abusers.

<p>-- During debate of that same bill, Senator Ashcroft voted to

defend a provision that would allow polluting industries to avoid

reporting most of their toxic chemical releases as required by the

1986 Community Right to Know Act (see: Roll Call Vote No. 306, July

13, 1995). The annual Toxic Release Inventory (TRI) listing, as it

is called, has enabled communities to track the operating

performances of local facilities and given these communities more

power to hold companies accountable and make informed decisions about

how toxic chemicals are to be managed.

<p>-- Recently, Senator Ashcroft voted to protect the mining industry

by attempting to block a rule that would require hardrock mining

companies to cover potential cleanup costs through bonds or insurance

deposits and hold mining companies accountable to strong

environmental performance standards (see: Roll Call Vote No. 224,

July 20, 2000). The rule, known as the "3809 rule" (43 CFR 3809),

was finally published this year after a long battle. It will serve

to protect the public by forcing one of the nation's largest toxic

polluters to act more responsibly.

<p>As this sampling of votes shows, former Senator John Ashcroft

consistently sought to undermine or gut the very laws that help to

protect fragile ecosystems and safeguard human health. If our

environment is to survive, we need someone who will actively and

effectively prosecute those that harm it. John Ashcroft's record

indicates that he would do otherwise.

<p>In summary, the position of Attorney General has substantial

discretion regarding how to address the diverse topics that the

United States Department of Justice defends and prosecutes. Based on

his record, Friends of the Earth sees no indication that John

Ashcroft will use this discretion for anything other than the

outright appeasement of polluting industries and weakening of our

nation's environmental protection laws. As such, Friends of the

Earth urges you to oppose his nomination.
