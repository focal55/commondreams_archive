- July 6 - Felony defendant Matthew Musselwhite, who was arrested

during the Republican National Convention (RNC) protests last summer, was

cleared of all charges today. Musselwhite was accused last August of

attempted murder and aggravated assault against Philadelphia police officer

John Livingston. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The charge of attempted murder was dropped at an earlier proceeding, and

this week&#146;s trial concerned the charge of Aggravated Assault and

Obstruction of Justice. The jury deliberated for less than thirty minutes

before deciding to acquit Musselwhite of all charges. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Musselwhite was defended by Shawn Nolan of the Philadelphia Defender

Association. Common Pleas Court Judge James A. Lineberger presided over the

trial. Because the prosecution&#146;s case was fraught with so many

inconsistencies, the defense rested without putting on any witnesses,

saying to the jury in closing arguments, &#147;The prosecution has made our case

for us.&#148; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Musselwhite, a 25-year old school teacher from Tucson, Arizona, was accused

of attempting to throw a Philadelphia Police Officer in front of a moving

car. Police reports claimed that the police officer sustained a fractured

elbow from being pushed to the ground.

 

After Musselwhite was released from jail last summer on misdemeanors,

officials decided to increase his charges to include attempted murder and

two violent felony counts. When Musselwhite arrived home, he discovered

that his charges had been changed. The Philadelphia police, working with

other law enforcement agencies, initiated a nationwide manhunt for

Musselwhite, harassing his relatives with stories that he was a &#147;terrorist.&#148;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">While staying in Ashland, Oregon last summer, Musselwhite continued to be

harassed by law enforcement. Local Ashland police published newspaper ads

seeking to detain Musselwhite, claiming he was &#147;armed and dangerous.&#148; When

Musselwhite voluntarily returned to Philadelphia to face new charges, the

District Attorney dropped the charge of attempted murder.

 

Over 95% of the cases from the Republican Convention Protests have resulted

in acquittals. Forty-three protesters were originally charged with

felonies, and all but four of these cases have now been resolved. None of

the RNC protest defendants have been convicted of felonies at trial. In one

recent felony trial, Philadelphia Police Commissioner John Timoney

testified in an attempt to convict an activist of attacking a police

officer.  The jury in that case acquitted the defendant of all charges.  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In another case, Timoney has claimed that three young men assaulted him and

another officer.  Common Please Court Judge Pamela Dembe threw out many of

their felonies in preliminary hearings, ruling that the charges were

excessive. The District Attorney has appealed that ruling in Pennsylvania

Superior Court--pushing off a trial for at least a year.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Over three hundred people arrested during the RNC were charged with

misdemeanors. A majority of those defendants rejected plea bargains and

proceeded to trial in order to bring to light the police misconduct that

surrounded the arrests. The resulting acquittals have given credence to

protesters&#146; claims of widespread police misconduct during the RNC arrests.</font></p>
