- September 21 - It was revealed yesterday that in light of pending military action and the need to keep the military at full force, the Pentagon has authorized the issuance of a &quot;stop loss&quot; order suspending discharges&#150;including those of servicemembers who have identified themselves as gay, lesbian, or bisexual and would otherwise be discharged under the &quot;Don't Ask; Don't Tell&quot; policy. A similar order was issued during the Persian Gulf War under the administration of President George H.W. Bush. The servicemembers who came out in the interim were discharged after the crisis passed and the suspension was lifted.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The National Gay and Lesbian Task Force today cautioned that this potential action does not indicate a repeal or change to the existing &quot;Don't Ask; Don't Tell&quot; policy. &quot;This 'stop loss' order shows the abject hypocrisy of the 'Don't Ask; Don't Tell' policy,&quot; said Lorri L. Jean, executive director of NGLTF. &quot;Civil rights are not a matter of convenience. If gay, lesbian and bisexual servicemembers are qualified to serve in times of national crisis, what possible argument can be made that they are not qualified to serve openly in times of peace? Excepting bigotry, there is none.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;In the tragic events of the last week, the entire nation bore witness to the fact that heroism and loss of life know no sexual orientation,&quot; Jean said. &quot;The people of this country overwhelmingly support the right of gay men and lesbians to serve in the military,&quot; Jean continued, referencing data from the 2000 National Election Survey which showed that 71.2 percent of all voters support such service. &quot;Once this crisis has subsided, we call upon American people to demand the repeal of the 'Don't Ask; Don't Tell' policy and thereby recognize the sacrifice of gay, lesbian and bisexual servicemembers during this time of national emergency.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The NGLTF Policy Institute issued a report in June of 2000 based upon data from the National Election Survey showing that 71.2 percent of the voting public supports the right of gay and lesbian people to serve openly in military service, while 22.9 percent are opposed and 5.9 percent are undecided. This is a marked change since 1992, when 55.4 percent supported military service. This represents a nearly 16-point increase in overall support between 1992 and 2000. The full analysis of the 2000 NES data can be downloaded.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">During the 2000 presidential campaign, both George W. Bush and Dick Cheney supported the current &quot;Don't Ask; Don't Tell&quot; policy. However in 1992, after his press secretary was outed by The Advocate, then-Defense Secretary Cheney stated that the claim that gay or lesbian people represented a higher security risk than heterosexuals was &quot;a bit of an old chestnut.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Since the order has not been issued and will likely not be permanent, servicemembers with legal questions about the order should seek assistance from Servicemembers Legal Defense Network (SLDN) at www.sldn.org or 202-328-3244. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>The National Gay and Lesbian Task Force has worked to eliminate prejudice, violence and injustice against gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people at the local, state and national level since its inception in 1973. As part of a broader social justice movement for freedom, justice and equality, NGLTF is creating a world that respects and celebrates the diversity of human expression and identity where all people may fully participate in society. </i></font></p>
