- December 19 - Attached below is a statement drafted and signed by 64 members of the

faculty and staff of The Evergreen State College in Olympia, Washington,

regarding the current crisis and war.  The resolution speaks for itself,

but it emphasizes that the signatories believe that they have a need to

speak out on this important issue specifically as educators.  The

resolution condemns the attacks of September 11th, supports the use of

international tribunals to bring to justice those who committed the

acts, and also encourages the U.S. to break the cycle of violence by

ending the war and not extending it further.  



<p>It also urges to the U.S. to collaborate with other governments around

the world to help end conditions that may generate terrorist acts and to

prevent immediate starvation in Afghanistan.  It further supports less

dependence on oil as an energy resource and requests federal spending

that benefits the majority of the people, and not primarily the

extremely wealthy and corporations.  It also urges the repeal of the

Patriot Act and military tribunals for noncitizens.  These are an attack

on civil liberties and rights and may undermine the free exchange of

ideas and education.



<p>It commends the administration of the college for its support of

academic freedom.  Recognizing that there are a diversity of views and

the intellectual strength in colleges and universities on the current

crisis, the signatories state in point #6, "We urge all educational

institutions to strongly support the academic freedom of their faculty,

staff and students and to publicly discuss the issues surrounding the

current crisis."

360-867-6513, mosqueda@evergreen.edu or Dr. Peter Bohmer at

December 19, 2001, page A13.

<p>EDUCATORS RESPONSE TO THE CURRENT CRISIS



<p>WHEREAS as citizens, residents of the United States, individual faculty

and Staff of The Evergreen State College, we are compelled by our

specific responsibilities as educators, to help our students have

personal engagement with the "real world" and link theory with practice;



<p>WHEREAS we feel a duty to express our alarm at a number of troubling

directions that are developing in the aftermath of the tragic attack on

the World Trade Centers in New York City on September 11, 2001;



<p>WHEREAS as educators responsible to our profession, our colleagues, our

students, 

our country, and people of the planet now and in the future, we, the

undersigned, 

offer the following resolution:



<p>1. We condemn the mass murder of thousands of people on September 11,

2001 in New

York, near Washington D.C. and Pennsylvania and express our profound

grief and condolences to families and friends of the victims of the

attack.



<p>2. We support the use of the World Court or other international

tribunals such as the International Criminal Court to bring to justice

all of those who were complicit in the September 11th, violent attack. 

Any use of force should be a multilateral approach that follows

international law and is only used to bring to trial those charged with

these crimes.



<p>3.  We urge that the U.S.  break the cycle of violence, bringing the

bombing to a conclusion immediately, ending actions that cause the death

of innocent people in Afghanistan, and bringing the war to a halt. 

Further we oppose any extension of this war by the U.S. into other

countries.



<p>4.  We urge that the U.S. collaborate with governments throughout the

world to address and overcome conditions such as poverty, malnutrition,

disease, oppression, and subjugation that make acts of terrorism more

likely. We also request that the U.S. donate, immediately, significant

resources to international relief agencies, in order to prevent

massive starvation in Afghanistan.



<p>5.  We commend the Evergreen State College administration for

respecting and supporting the academic freedom and civil liberties of

the entire Evergreen community and request that it continue to do so.



<p>6.  We urge all educational institutions to strongly support the

academic freedom of their faculty, staff and students and to publicly

discuss the issues surrounding the current crisis.

 

<p>7.  We support a national campaign to lessen our dependence on oil and

to commit to a nationwide conversion to renewable energy sources within

ten years.



<p>8.  We support federal spending that will directly benefit those who

have lost jobs since September 11th, such as continued health insurance

and unemployment insurance, and request that the federal government

provide revenues to the States so that they do not cut social programs

and public education. We support spending for health care, energy

conversion, education, and mass transit, and we support tax cuts for

low- income people.  We oppose the current federal tax cuts that provide

little stimulus to the economy and huge tax breaks for corporations and

the wealthy.



<p>9.  We urge the repeal of the USA PATRIOT ACT, the so-called

anti-terrorism act which is an attack on all of our civil liberties and

rights, particularly those of non-citizens, immigrants, and Muslims. 

The vague definition of terrorism and its major expansion of police

power constitute a threat to democracy. It has the potential to

undermine the free exchange of ideas, which lies at the heart of our

mission as an educational institution. We also strongly oppose the

establishment of military tribunals to try noncitizens the government

accuses of terrorism.
