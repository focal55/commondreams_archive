- September 11 - As we write, Manhattan feels under siege, with all bridges, tunnels, and 

subways closed, and tens of thousands of people walking slowly north from 

Lower Manhattan.  As we sit in our offices here at War Resisters League, 

our most immediate thoughts are of the hundreds if not thousands of New 

Yorkers who have lost their lives in the collapse of the World Trade 

Center.  The day is clear, the sky is blue, but vast clouds billow over the 

ruins where so many have died, including a great many rescue workers who 

were there when the final collapse occurred.



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Of course we know that our friends and co-workers in Washington, D.C. have 

similar thoughts about the ordinary people who have been trapped in the 

parts of the Pentagon which were also struck by a jet.  And we think of the 

innocent passengers on the hi-jacked jets who were carried to their doom on 

this day.



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We do not know at this time from what source the attack came.  We do know 

that Yasser Arafat has condemned the bombing.  We hesitate to make an 

extended analysis until more information is available but some things are 

clear.  For the Bush Administration to talk of spending hundreds of 

billions on Star Wars is clearly the sham it was from the beginning, when 

terrorism can so easily strike through more routine means.



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We urge Congress and George Bush that whatever response or policy the U.S. 

develops it will be clear that this nation will no longer target civilians, 

or accept any policy by any nation which targets civilians.  This would 

mean an end to the sanctions against Iraq, which have caused the deaths of 

hundreds of thousands of civilians.  It would mean not only a condemnation 

of terrorism by Palestinians but also the policy of assassination against 

the Palestinian leadership by Israel, and the ruthless repression of the 

Palestinian population and the continuing occupation by Israel of the West 

Bank and Gaza.



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The policies of militarism pursued by the United States have resulted in 

millions of deaths, from the historic tragedy of the Indochina war, through 

the funding of death squads in Central America and Colombia, to the 

sanctions and air strikes against Iraq.  This nation is the largest 

supplier of "conventional weapons" in the worldand those weapons fuel the 

starkest kind of terrorism from Indonesia to Africa.  The early policy 

support for armed resistance in Afghanistan resulted in the victory of the 

Talibanand the creation of Osama Bin Laden.



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Other nations have also engaged in these policies.  We have, in years past, 

condemned the actions of the Russian government in areas such as Chechnya, 

the violence on both sides in the Middle East, and in the Balkans.  But our 

nation must take responsibility for its own actions. Up until now we have 

felt safe within our borders.  To wake on a clear day to find our largest 

city under siege reminds us that in a violent world, none are safe.



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Let us seek an end of the militarism that has characterized this nation for 

decades.  Let us seek a world in which security is gained through 

disarmament, international cooperation, and social justice not through 

escalation and retaliation.  We condemn without reservation attacks such as 

those which occurred today, which strike at thousands of civiliansmay these 

profound tragedies remind us of the impact U.S. policies have had on other 

civilians in other lands.  We also condemn reflexive hostility against 

people of Arab descent living in this country and urge that Americans 

recall the part of our heritage that opposes bigotry in all forms.



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We are one world.  We shall live in a state of fear and terror or we shall 

move toward a future in which we seek peaceful alternatives to violence, 

and a more just distribution of the world's resources.  As we mourn the 

many lives lost, our hearts call out for reconciliation, not revenge. </font>
