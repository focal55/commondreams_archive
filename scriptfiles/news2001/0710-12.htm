- July 10 - Redefining Progress' Board of Directors announced today that they have named Michel Gelobter the organization's new executive director. Gelobter, who was been a member of RP's board of directors since 1995, has begun the transition into his new position.

<P>"The board and staff are extremely pleased that Michel agreed to lead Redefining Progress and coordinate the vital work we are doing," said Redefining Progress Board of Directors Chairperson Rosemary Fei. "Michel knows Redefining Progress well and has played a role in shaping many of its programs in the past, including our efforts on climate change and environmental justice in collaboration with the environmental justice networks."</P>



<P>"At the beginning of the 21st century, more than ever before, the question being asked is: 'Where do we go from here?'" said Gelobter. "It seems to me that Redefining Progress has more than its share of answers to that question, and I'm honored and excited to be joining in the work of turning policy answers into real-world solutions."</P>



<P>Gelobter has experience both as an academic and activist. He has been an assistant professor in the Graduate Department of Public Administration at Rutgers University since 1995, during which time he founded and ran the Community/University Consortium for Regional Environmental Justice (a regional research entity spanning New Jersey, New York, and Puerto Rico). Prior to that, Gelobter started the Environmental Policy Program at Columbia University's School of International and Public Affairs.</P>



<P>Gelobter was Director of Environmental Quality and an Assistant Commissioner for the Department of Environmental Protection administration of former Mayor David N. Dinkins from 1990-92. He also served as the environment and health issues director during Dinkins' successful mayoral campaign in 1989. Gelobter was a Congressional Black Caucus Fellow and served with the U.S. House of Representatives' Energy and Commerce Committee from 1988-89. </P>



<P>Gelobter earned his B.S. in conservation and resource studies from the University of California, Berkeley in 1984. He earned a M.S., with an emphasis on the environment and the poor in industrialized countries, from U.C.-Berkeley in 1986. He earned his Ph.D. from U.C-Berkeley's Energy and Resources Group in 1993. </P>



<P>Redefining Progress' previous Executive Director, Joanne Kliejunas, is leaving to accept a position as executive director of the new Schoepflin Foundation in Berkeley, Calif.</P>



<P><i>Redefining Progress is a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization based in Oakland, Calif., that develops policies and tools to reorient the economy to value people and nature first. RP does this by developing policies that capture the economy's hidden social and environmental costs, transform the human use and distribution of the Earth's natural resources, and restore the value of shared social and natural assets.</i></P>
