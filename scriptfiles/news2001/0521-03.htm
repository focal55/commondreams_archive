- May 21 - Senator Chris Dodd of Connecticut, Congressman George Miller of California, and Marian Wright Edelman, founder and president of the Children's Defense Fund, will announce a new comprehensive bill to ensure all children in America get what they need to thrive and be safe, healthy, and educated. The Act to Leave No Child Behind provides a solid action agenda to deliver children from poverty, violence, and neglect. It combines the best public and private ideas and proposals into a single, comprehensive measure with 12 specific Titles to improve the lives of children. With 12 million children in America still living in poverty and 10.8 million without health insurance, this act is urgently needed. Although many provisions of the Act are focused on our most vulnerable children, a number of sections, such as environmental safeguards, strengthening public education, and improving the quality of children's health care, would benefit all children, regardless of their economic status. </font>
