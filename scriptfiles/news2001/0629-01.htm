- June 29 - Critics are expressing dismay in response to published reports that the White House is exploring options for resumption of American 

nuclear blasts. The Knight Ridder news service reported Thursday that &quot;the 

Bush administration has asked U.S. nuclear weapons scientists to examine 

ways that nuclear test explosions beneath the Nevada desert could resume 

more quickly if the government decides to end a nine-year moratorium on 

nuclear testing.&quot;</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">         The following nuclear policy analysts are available for interviews:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">PRESTON J. TRUMAN, <a href="mailto:hermit@downwinders.org">hermit@downwinders.org</a>, <a href="http://www.downwinders.org" target="new">http://www.downwinders.org</a><br>

Director of the Downwinders organization, Truman has worked with thousands 

of Americans who, like himself, have dealt with the aftermath of fallout 

from nuclear explosions in Nevada. He said today: &quot;The Bush administration 

has been undermining the ABM Treaty and the Outer Space Treaty; now this 

signal that they may resume below-ground testing also leads to an ominous 

conclusion -- that the U.S. is preparing to unilaterally jettison an arms 

control regime fostered by every president since Eisenhower.... This 

threatens a costly and dangerous new arms race, alarming to our allies as 

well as our adversaries.... We know now that 58 percent of the more than 

900 underground nuclear tests conducted over 33 years leaked radiation, 

many of those exposing citizens far from the Nevada Test Site borders to 

harmful doses. A resumption of nuclear testing would repeat this nightmare 

for our descendents.&quot;</font></p>

Executive director of the Western States Legal Foundation, Cabasso said 

today: &quot;This latest 'trial balloon' is yet more evidence that George W. 

Bush's pledges to reduce the number of U.S. nuclear weapons and walk away 

from 'Mutually Assured Destruction' are nothing more than smoke and 

mirrors. Behind the smoke and mirrors is a dangerous and destabilizing, 

increasingly unilateral foreign policy, buttressed by the threatened use of 

new and improved nuclear weapons. Just one year ago, the U.S. government 

reaffirmed its Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty commitments to the 

'cessation of the arms race' and the 'elimination of nuclear weapons.' The 

U.S. also agreed to a 'diminishing role' for nuclear weapons, and to a 

no-backtracking 'principle of irreversibility' for arms control and nuclear 

disarmament measures. In the eyes of the rest of the world, the 

Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, signed by the United States in 1996 but not 

yet ratified, is at the very top of that list of measures.&quot;</font></p>

Research associate with the Program on Science and Global Security at 

Princeton University and author of &quot;Bombing Bombay: Effects of Nuclear 

Weapons and a Case Study of a Hypothetical Explosion,&quot; Ramana said today: &quot;This results in part from the pressure exerted by the military-industrial 

complex; for many years now, weapons scientists have advocated 'retaining 

the ability to develop new nuclear options.' One can expect defense 

planners in several countries around the world, especially areas like East 

and South Asia, to recommend dealing with this new facet of U.S. foreign 

and military policy by further developing weapons of their own.&quot;</font></p>
