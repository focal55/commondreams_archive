- July 9 -  News Advisory:

<p>A new report, to be issued by the National Housing Conference

(NHC), finds that the number of low- to moderate-income working

families with critical housing needs grew from 3 million to 3.7

million, an increase of 23 percent between 1997 and 1999. Paycheck

to Paycheck: Working Families and the Cost of Housing in America

will be publicly released by NHC on Wednesday July 11, at 2 p.m. in

room 2105 of the Rayburn House Office Building. Members of Congress

will receive the report at this event and will provide comments.

<p>Paycheck to Paycheck: Working Families and the Cost of Housing

in America is part of a series of reports prepared by the National

Housing Conference's Center for Housing Policy (CHP) which focuses

on the housing needs of working families. Last June, the CHP

released a groundbreaking report, Housing America's Working

Families. That report revealed overall that over 13 million

families in this country had critical housing needs.

<p>Paycheck to Paycheck takes two new approaches to analyzing this

issue. First, it reviews the latest information from the 1999

American Housing Survey (AHS), and describes the overall number and

characteristics of working families with critical housing needs.

The second part of the analysis examines whether working families

who earn prevailing wages for selected occupations are able to pay

reasonable costs for housing in the communities in which they live.

This analysis is carried out for 5 vital occupations-Janitor,

Elementary School Teacher, Police Officer, Licensed Practical

Nurse, and Retail Salesperson-in 60 of the nation's largest housing

markets including Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Denver, Seattle, Los

Angeles and New York. For example, the analysis contained in the

report indicates that a janitor working full-time in Seattle needs

more than 1.5 times his annual salary to afford a 2-bedroom

apartment. A policeman in Seattle needs nearly 2 times his salary

to afford a median priced home.

<p><i>The National Housing Conference (NHC), a 501(c)(3) member

organization, is a coalition of affordable housing experts from the

public and private sectors. Since 1931, NHC has been an essential

source of broad, nonpartisan information concerning national

housing policy.</i>
