- January 2 - Medicare beneficiaries will have to pay substantially more out

of their own pockets for health care in the future, according to a

new report by researchers at the Urban Institute conducted with

support from The Commonwealth Fund. Those with low incomes and

health problems will be at even greater risk than average

beneficiaries for costs such as Medicare premiums, medical

services, and prescription drugs.

<p>In Growth in Medicare and Out-of-Pocket Spending: Impact on

Vulnerable Beneficiaries, authors Stephanie Maxwell, Marilyn Moon,

and Misha Segal estimate how expected health care cost increases

will affect various groups of beneficiaries under existing program

guidelines. "Beneficiaries are often left out of the equation when

proposals to change Medicare are considered," said Marilyn Moon,

senior fellow at the Urban Institute. "These findings suggest that

shifting even more expenditures to beneficiaries should not be the

only solution to the problem generated by the increase in overall

health care spending."

<p>Out-of-Pocket Spending Increases Will Overly Burden the Most

Vulnerable Beneficiaries Average out-of-pocket costs today for

services not covered by Medicare -- including premiums, medical

services, and prescription drugs -- are $3,142. By 2025, average

out-of-pocket costs will rise to $5,248 (in 2000 dollars). Even

more important is the projection that by 2025, older low-income

women in poor health will be hit with out-of-pocket costs of $9,378

(in 2000 dollars) -- an increase from $5,969 in 2000.

<p>When out-of-pocket cost increases are calculated as a proportion

of income, the disproportionate burden on the most vulnerable is

even more striking. Because health care costs will rise faster than

the incomes of Medicare beneficiaries, by 2025 all elderly

Americans will pay nearly one-third (29.9 percent) of their income

on out-of-pocket health care costs, an increase from about

one-fifth in 2000. Older low-income women in poor health are

projected to spend nearly three-fourths (71.8 percent) of their

income for health care -- or forgo needed care.

<p>"These projections sound a clear warning about the ability of

Medicare to keep its promise of protecting elderly Americans from

impoverishment," said Karen Davis, president of The Commonwealth

Fund. "If we do not address cost burdens and the adequacy of

benefits, many beneficiaries -- especially those with multiple

chronic conditions and those with low incomes -- will be forced to

make choices between basic necessities such as food or housing, and

health care."

<p>The authors note that between 2000 and 2025 the Medicare

population will increase dramatically -- from about 40 million to

70 million -- and the program will have to deal with escalating

health care costs. These pressures on Medicare cannot be resolved

by simply shifting costs to beneficiaries. Other revenues are

likely to be necessary.
