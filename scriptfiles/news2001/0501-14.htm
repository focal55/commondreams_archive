- May 1 -  An alliance of 16 leading

nuclear non-proliferation organizations said President Bush's call

for a massive and expensive, air-, sea-, and space-based national

missile defense system will decrease, rather than increase, overall

American and international security and undercut the value of

possible reductions in U.S. offensive nuclear weapons and

standing-down U.S. weapons from hair-trigger alert.

<p>"The Bush Administration is unwisely betting our nation's security

against nuclear dangers on unproven and costly missile defenses,"

said John Isaacs, president of the Council for a Livable World, a

Coalition member organization. "Instead of deploying a

technologically questionable defense against missile attacks, the

President should focus on minimizing the most urgent nuclear dangers

by reducing the Russian nuclear arsenal, securing excess nuclear

material in the former Soviet Union, and convincing North Korea to

end its long-range missile program," said Isaacs.

<p>"The cost of the Bush national missile defense plan would be high,

and the benefits to security very low. National missile defense

deployment would cost well over $100 billion and would not provide

any significant protection from weapons of mass destruction. At the

same time, it would set off a dangerous action-reaction cycle,

involving the U.S., Russia, and China," said Daryl G. Kimball,

executive director of the Coalition to Reduce Nuclear Dangers.

<p>"Before the President commits the U.S. to this risky course of

action, he must demonstrate that national missile defense will be

effective and reliable, that it will be a cost effective use of

taxpayer dollars, that it will not adversely affect other

nuclear-risk reduction goals, and that diplomatic efforts to curb or

freeze missile programs of concern have been exhausted," said

Kimball. Earlier this year, the President said he was not ready to

resume talks with North Korea on the verifiable elimination of their

long-range missile program.

<p>"There is no quick, easy or cheap national missile defense

technology. The Bush administration should be careful not to give the

false impression that it can develop an effective national missile

defense in the near future," said Kimball. A recent independent

Pentagon audit and reports from the General Accounting Office

underscore the dangers of ignoring the limitations of NMD

technologies for the purpose of meeting arbitrary, politically-driven

deadlines. Contrary to the claims of sea-based and "boost-phase"

national missile defense proponents, such technologies will not be

available for over a decade or more.

<p>"Contrary to Bush's goal of eliminating the

mutual-assured-destruction policies of the Cold War, Bush's formula

will make it more difficult to deal with lingering Cold War dangers

and create new proliferation problems. U.S. national missile defense

deployment would prod Russia into keeping a larger number of its

strategic weapons on hair-trigger alert, thus perpetuating the

dangerous nuclear standoff and risk of accidental nuclear war," said

Stephen Young of the Union of Concerned Scientists.

<p>If the U.S. deploys NMD, Russian officials have said they may

equip its road-mobile SS-27 long-range missiles with multiple nuclear

warheads, extend the life of its SS-19 missile, and build a new

multiple-warhead submarine-launched missile. China, which now

possesses 20 long-range, nuclear-armed missiles may respond by

modernizing its arsenal for hair-trigger launch, and increase its

strategic nuclear arsenal to as many as 250 warheads or more.

<p>"Contrary to President Bush's assertion that the 1972

Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty is irrelevant, the agreement

continues to stabilize the strategic nuclear balance and does not

impede research and early development of national missile defense

systems planned in the near future," noted John Rhinelander, of the

Lawyers Alliance for World Security.

<p>"The ABM Treaty remains essential to arms control as well as

nuclear non-proliferation because it promotes stability and

facilitates offensive nuclear weapons reductions. We must work with

Russia, China, and others to accomplish our global security goals and

not act unilaterally," added Rhinelander, the former U.S. legal

advisor for the Nixon Administration's ABM Treaty negotiation team.

<p>Today, President Bush hinted that the U.S. should reduce its

deployed nuclear weapons arsenal from its current level of 7295 bombs

and remove some U.S. nuclear weapons from hair-trigger alert. The U.

S. retains another 600-700 tactical nuclear weapons and another 2500

"reserve" nuclear bombs.

<p>"Unilateral nuclear reductions and the standing down of some U.S.

nuclear weapons would be a long-overdue and very welcome initiative

that could jump-start the stalled arms reduction process," said Ira

Shorr, director of the organization, Back from the Brink.

"Unfortunately a spoonful of sugar can't make the NMD medicine go

down," he said.

<p>"The ultimate goal of any unilateral initiative by the Bush

administration is to get Russia to reciprocate. U.S. NMD deployment

will only encourage Russia to keep a larger number of its strategic

nuclear forces on a high level of alert to preserve their ability to

respond to a U.S. first strike. This perpetuates the danger of a

nuclear war by accident or miscalculation," said Shorr.

<p>"Rather than rush towards deployment of an unproven NMD system,

President Bush should pursue verifiable, U.S. and Russian nuclear

arms reductions, elimination of dangerous, Cold War launch-on-warning

and targeting plans, and nuclear proliferation efforts, including the

Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty and a verifiable freeze of

North Korea's ballistic missile program," Kimball concluded.

<p><i>The Coalition to Reduce Nuclear Dangers is a non-partisan alliance

of 16 national nuclear non-proliferation organizations dedicated to

the pursuit of a practical, step-by-step program to address the

threat of nuclear weapons. For further information on national
